Me??  65

Having coffee in the porch this morning thinking of my mom (7/49-11/24) and my job.
I have been a CNA since 12/24 and started in Hospice care 2/1/25. I absolutely love my job! The ladies took great care of my mom!!! I don't know what we would have done without them. My mom passed away at home where she wanted to be and I wanted to be like the CNA's.
There are patients in Hospice that don't get a choice of any kind in their final days!! I just want them to be comfortable and know that they are not alone!!
The RN's are making me feel even older than 65!! I like them all but I didn't realize how much that they didn't like me! I was called into the office on my day off!!! Our manager and Charge Nurse were telling me how much they said I wasn't helping, working alone, cussing up and down the halls.
My first question was 'How can I work alone when these people are so hard to turn alone or bathe alone? There is no way!!'
I work nights and don't want to go but I love my job!!

It feels like over the past month or two that Angela's been having a real moment of sorts. She has recently been on the following shows and podcasts.  

* Game Changers season 7 episode 5 titled ""The Drinking Game"" where a group of contestants had to compete in a series of challenges while drunk/drinking to win money. After each round they had to vote off who they thought was the secret sober person. The sober person would win the money if not voted off by the end.
* Parlor Room Dropouts equivalent to Board AF where they played Cash 'N Guns.
* [Good Mythical Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZAIXaa3PJI). A crew hosted spinoff of GMM. 
* [Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=autmh7vSAH8) of Patrick McDonald's (former writer) new show/podcast Havin' A Day where guests drive around LA and run errands, get food, or just have fun outings. Kind of a YouTuber equivalent of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.
* [Episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yd4oMvrNYhY) of the The Business Casual Show podcast (former writer Jeremy Elder is one of the hosts).

Smart Data & self-tests, didn't show any hard drive errors

This started appearing after I spilled water on my pc lol, it went to the PSU, which although worked, I had replaced, it also probably splashed on the GPU, which I suspect might be the cause, but I don't know how to diagnose that without a spare graphics card, and well they are expensive so I would rather not buy one if it's not necessary

I also sometimes get a black screen when playing games on windows, for a second it goes black, and then goes back to normal, been happening for god knows how long, even before the spill

How can I identify the cause of the errors?

Why do most businesses even bother with decaf? Who are these mysterious weirdos who actually drink decaf coffee? 

It's also worth noting that I've tried decaf a few times, and it TEARS my stomach up. Maybe it's a problem from my end, but I've heard similar from others, and I've read that it's from weird chemicals that are used for the decaffeinating process. 

The taste is also noticeably different for me, like something unnatural. There's been a few times I didn't realize I got decaf until I took a sip and tasted something off (I drink it black).

Seriously... what demographic is consuming decaf? Is it actually profitable? 

Maybe it's profitable because the extracted caffeine is sold elsewhere in other forms, and the decaffeinated coffee is basically industrial waste gets shilled to businesses like hotels for a little more money?",2,1750162603.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I was going to put Doc Amos on the list but MSB is out of the closet now so I don't think that will work.

And I'm including RK on the list too because the RK/ Shady shippers are worse than Swifties.

Also Pervy Evil Grandma doesn't count cuz she already seduced her. Which is probably why this war is going on (damned lesbians).

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üëã Ever felt like your deadlines are plotting against you? You‚Äôre not alone. I mean, seriously, who knew dates on a calendar could be so intimidating? üòÇ Last week, my stress levels were higher than my caffeine intake‚Äî*and that's saying something*.

**So, what's the secret weapon I found? Box breathing.** Yep, that‚Äôs right! Box breathing is basically meditation‚Äôs underrated cousin that loves structure and simplicity. After just 7 days of practice, my cortisol levels decided they'd just go ahead and drop by 30%. Fancy that!

**Here‚Äôs how I made it work (even if you‚Äôre the busiest bee üêù in the hive):**

1. **Commit to just 5 minutes a day**: I get it, we‚Äôve all got things to do, people to see, and shows to binge. But trust me, 5 minutes is all you need to reset your brain from chaos-mode to monk-level calm.

2. **The Method**:
   - **Breathe in for 4 seconds** ‚Äì Fill those lungs like you‚Äôre inflating a balloon. üéà
   - **Hold for 4 seconds** ‚Äì No cheating!
   - **Exhale for 4 seconds** ‚Äì Slow and steady wins the race.
   - **Hold for another 4 seconds** ‚Äì Rinse and repeat! üåÄ

3. **Do it anywhere, anytime**: Stuck in traffic? Waiting for your coffee to brew? Perfect. No zen garden required! üåø

4. **Visualize the box**: Picture a square moving with your breath. It sounds quirky, but the focus helps clear your mind.

**Weird side effects I didn't expect?**

- Side-eye from my cat during home practice sessions. üê±
- Instantly falling asleep faster after a stressful day.
- Enhancement of superhero focus powers. Seriously, *Watch out, deadlines!*

I still have those ""Can anyone grant me extra hours in the day?"" moments. But now, they‚Äôre fewer and farther between‚Äîand that‚Äôs what counts, right?

Anyway, has anyone else given box breathing a try, or have other stress-busting hacks up their sleeve? Drop your stories, fellow warriors‚Äîyou never know who might benefit from your insight! üåü",1,1750162435.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1ldlgw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DOG/comments/1ldlgw4/im_in_a_hostage_situation/,I'm in a hostage situation,"Is anyone else facing a unique experience of implementing a routine so well that not only do their dogs do everything automatically, but they also remind you of the routine? üòÇ

_Some examples:__

In my house, we have 4 dogs of big size and massive personality, so routine is everything in this home.

**The cool part:**
- Without a word, after eating they go potty. 
- If I put my coffee down in the morning, nothing happens. But if I put my finished coffee (empty mug, down), they automatically run to the designated eating area.

**The interesting part:**
If I drink coffee and put down an empty mug at any other time of the day, they don't even bat an eye. Nobody moves. 

 **The funny _problem_**
They eat at the exact same time in the evening every day.
 
So when the clock strikes the relevant eating o'clock:
- Dog 1: Sits in front of me. Stares into my soul whining and trembling
- Dog 2: Runs to designated food area (from wherever he is) 
- Dog 3 & 4: Stand up and circle me like sharks while whacking me with helicopter tails

This happens **EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY.** There's no alarm or anything. They just have some sort of internal body clock that tells them it's time to eat. üòÇ

**The interesting part for this one:**
If I stand up one hour before food time. No one even flinches. Half an hour before? Everyone is still watching TV or basking in the sun. Five minutes before? Everyone rises (from REM) running to the designated eating place. 

**The funny _problem_ (2nd edition)**
Sometimes I go out and come back late (after normal food time). Instead of greeting me at the door, they wait to make sure it's me. Once confirmed, everyone runs to their designated eating area, sitting in silence, waiting for me to bring the food. They will sit there until the food comes, whether it takes 5 minutes or 30 minutes. Because guess what, that's what I always do when I get home late.

**Tl:dr**
I'm in a hostage situation with my dogs; we made a routine, and they stick to it like velcro. They alert me when I'm late. We don't have an alarm or clock in the house, but they somehow always know the time.

**Has routine ever bitten you in the bum bum?**",1,1750162253.0,DOG,0,1.0,False

1ldlfg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuscularDystrophy/comments/1ldlfg8/strange_head_sensations_kyphoscoliosis_fear_and_a/,"Strange head sensations, kyphoscoliosis, fear, and a feeling of disconnection ‚Äî any relief advice?","Hi everyone,
I'm 20 years old and have Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I also have kyphoscoliosis, and for the second time in my life, I‚Äôm experiencing a strange and deeply uncomfortable state that‚Äôs hard to explain. It first happened in 2023, after I spent 14 days in the hospital (including ICU). The cause was a very intense physical therapy session where a specialist pushed too hard trying to stretch my leg and back ‚Äî I lost consciousness due to the strain, and was hospitalized.

Interestingly, while I was still in the hospital, I didn‚Äôt feel anything unusual. But once I returned home and resumed sitting during the day, I began experiencing strange sensations in my head. That period lasted about 6‚Äì7 months. It was only when I started emotionally connecting with a girl ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt know it, but that connection gave me strength ‚Äî that things slowly returned to normal. We‚Äôre no longer in touch.

Now, in 2025, it has come back again ‚Äî unexpectedly, and without any clear emotional or physical trigger. There was no stress. That day, I drank some coffee and was thinking deeply about moral and philosophical topics. At night, as I lay down to sleep, I suddenly had a brief dizzy spell ‚Äî maybe one minute long ‚Äî and from that point on, everything changed.

Since then, I‚Äôve had ongoing sensations that are hard to describe. It feels like something is pulling at the top of my head ‚Äî a strange tension, as if something is tugging gently but constantly. These sensations fluctuate: sometimes they‚Äôre milder, other times they become more intense. I also have tension around my eyes, headaches, and a sense of internal imbalance. My perception feels subtly off ‚Äî not like classic vertigo, but like my head isn't quite aligned with my body.

It actually feels calmer when I‚Äôm lying down. I usually close my eyes and place a blanket next to my head just to feel something nearby, and I keep a stick or mop close ‚Äî it helps me stay grounded. I‚Äôm not afraid to lie on my left side, but I avoid turning onto my right. My scoliosis curves out on the right side, and for some reason, that position feels threatening or unsafe.

Surprisingly, when I‚Äôm outside and someone is pushing my wheelchair ‚Äî when I‚Äôm moving through the street, seeing things around me ‚Äî I feel almost completely normal. It‚Äôs like the symptoms vanish during those walks. I feel alive and clear-headed, and the discomfort fades. But the moment I return home and sit still, everything slowly starts creeping back.

About a week ago, my blood pressure spiked to 120/100 (which is high for me), and I felt absolutely awful. I couldn‚Äôt lie down because my head would spin every time I tried. Only after we got my pressure back to normal was I finally able to rest without dizziness. Normally my blood pressure is stable and within the normal range.

On top of the physical sensations, there‚Äôs also a layer of constant, low-grade anxiety. It feels like fear without a clear reason ‚Äî like my body is stuck in a quiet, alert state. Even when nothing is happening, I feel uneasy, and it's especially strong when I'm alone. Sometimes I sit holding a mop or a stick ‚Äî not for support, but because it gives me a strange sense of grounding, like something to anchor to.

Looking at a phone screen becomes very unpleasant when the sensations kick in, almost overwhelming ‚Äî but I try to push through and ignore it. What helps a bit is playing games where there‚Äôs constant motion, like Euro Truck Simulator 2. That dynamic movement on screen seems to reduce the discomfort slightly, so that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been spending most of my days ‚Äî trying to stay distracted enough to not feel it so much.

In 10 days, my sister is getting married, and there will be a family gathering. I really don‚Äôt want to burden my parents or spoil the atmosphere because of how I feel. I‚Äôm looking for any advice: is there a medication or technique that can at least temporarily relieve these symptoms? Even partial relief would help me get through the event more comfortably.

I‚Äôve read about vegetative dystonia and wonder if this could be related, but I‚Äôm still not sure. If anyone has been through something similar ‚Äî especially with spinal issues like kyphoscoliosis ‚Äî or knows of something that could help (medication, breathing techniques, grounding methods), I‚Äôd be incredibly grateful to hear from you.

Thanks so much for reading.",1,1750162135.0,MuscularDystrophy,0,1.0,False

1ldlf0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ldlf0f/the_voice_in_the_woods/,The Voice In The Woods,"We live tucked deep in the Southern Appalachian mountains, in a holler no GPS will find and no outsider wants to stumble into after dark. The kind of place where the woods don't end-they swallow. There's a hush to the land out here. The kind of quiet that doesn't feel empty, just watchful.

It was just past midnight when it happened. A Thursday, I think. The air was still, heavy with the scent of moss and pine, the kind of thick silence that settles over everything once the cicadas burn out. The kids were asleep. My wife had gone to bed an hour earlier, and I stayed behind in the kitchen, sipping bad coffee and scrolling through nothing.

Then I heard her call my name-sharp, afraid.

I moved fast. That's not how she calls unless something's wrong. I bolted down the hall toward our bedroom-only to find it empty. The covers pulled back, the lamp still on. My stomach dropped.

Out the window, I spotted her-sitting in our old Jeep, parked just beyond the porch light's reach. The moon was bright enough to cast everything in silver, and I could see her clearly, wide-eyed, staring out across the yard toward the woods.

That's when John ran.

He came tearing down the gravel drive barefoot, shirtless, wild-eyed. He didn't even look at me. Just hit the treeline and vanished into the dark like something was chasing him, or like he was running straight into hell to avoid it.

Then I heard it.

""Hello?""

A child's voice. Small. Lost. A little girl-no older than six. It floated out from the black edge of the woods, just beyond the first row of trees.

There was something about it-the way it held my name without saying it. The way it cracked just a little at the end, like she was trying not to cry.

I called back, ""Hey! Who's out there?""

The voice answered, same tone. Same softness.
""Hello?""

It wasn't just an answer. It was an echo-but not mine. It didn't sound like something trying to be a kid. It sounded like something pretending. And doing it too well.

My wife hadn't moved. Still frozen in the car, but now she was staring at me. I saw it in her face-the shift. From fear to real fear. Whatever was in those woods, she felt it too.

I motioned her toward the house, and she moved fast. She left the car door open as she sprinted. The moment she passed me, I turned to follow.

That's when it called again.

""Hello?""

Closer now. Same voice. Too close.

Every inch of my body tightened. My skin knew before my brain did: this wasn't some lost child. This was a trap. Something trying to get close enough for something worse.

I broke into a sprint. Feet hitting the porch hard, the wood creaking under me. I slammed the front door shut and threw the deadbolt. My wife collapsed against the hallway wall, breathing fast. I didn't ask questions-I didn't need to.

We both knew.

Silence. Then-

Scratch.
Low. Deliberate. A slow drag of nails-not fingertips-across the wood just beneath the handle.

Then the voice again. Just on the other side.

""Hello?""

The scratching stopped.

No footsteps. No rustling. Just that brutal silence the mountains keep like a secret. You could've heard a mouse shift in the walls-or your own heartbeat cracking in your ears.

We stood still. My wife slid down the wall and curled her knees to her chest. I placed one hand on the doorframe like I was holding it closed with more than just the lock. Truth was, I didn't trust the bolt. Not with that voice out there.

Out here in the deep woods, you learn to respect what doesn't make sense.

I checked the time. 1:03 a.m. That meant we had hours before dawn. Hours of shadow. Of not knowing. Of that thing waiting out there. Or worse-circling.

""Should we call someone?"" she whispered.

Call who? The county sheriff lives forty minutes away. Cell signal's a rumor this deep in the holler. Even if we got a bar, what do I say?
""Something's scratching my door and pretending to be a lost little girl""?

She knew the answer already. She didn't ask again.

I walked to the back window and peered through the blinds. The treeline lay still. The moon lit up the yard like frost, but past the first dozen trees, it was all ink. That kind of dark where your eyes never adjust. Like the woods weren't empty-just full of something that knew how to hold still.

And that voice...

It wasn't gone. Not really. I could feel it, just past the light. Like someone watching you from a place they've already memorized.

That's the thing about these mountains: they know how to listen. They soak up sound. They let your screams die in the hollows and come back to you as whispers. They don't care if you're scared.

I pulled the shotgun from above the fireplace. It was loaded. It wouldn't help.

""Maybe it's gone,"" my wife said. But she didn't believe it. Her voice was just one more thing to keep the quiet from swallowing us.

I don't know what time I fell asleep, but I remember the last thing I heard before I did.

A soft tap. Not a knock. Just a test. Like a finger running along glass.

From the kitchen window this time.

Then-

""Hello?""
They say the mountains have rules.

Old ones. Not written down, not spoken often. Just known. If you grow up in these woods-or stay long enough-you learn to keep your porch light on, your curtains closed, and your door locked tight after sunset. You don't whistle at night. You don't call back when something calls your name. And above all, you don't open the door.

We didn't open the door.

But that thing didn't leave.

The next few hours blurred into a long, breathless stretch of waiting. The tapping moved-sometimes on the front door, sometimes the windows. Sometimes it circled the house in long, dragging loops. I'd hear it at the kitchen glass...then five seconds later, at the back porch...then, nothing.

Then-

""Hello?""

My wife clutched my hand tight whenever it came close. She didn't ask what it was. She knew. It wasn't a child. It wasn't lost. It was inviting itself in.

At 2:27 a.m., it found the kids' window.

The first tap was light-like a moth against the glass. Then another. Then three in a row. Rhythmic.

My daughter's voice floated down the hall. ""Daddy?""

I was already moving.

I slipped into the room. She and her younger brother sat up in bed, their eyes wide but calm. They didn't cry. Didn't scream. Mountain kids. They'd been raised to respect the dark.

""There's someone at the window,"" she said. ""She keeps saying hello.""

I looked. The curtains were drawn. But I felt it. Right there, on the other side.

I motioned them out of the room silently, guiding them to the couch in the living room where my wife had pulled blankets and cushions into a quiet nest.

We didn't speak. Not because we were afraid to-but because it was listening.

For the next hour, it danced around the house. The voice would disappear, and in its place-silence so loud you could feel it vibrating inside your chest. The kind of quiet that doesn't bring peace. The kind that tells you something's thinking.

Then, around 4:00 a.m., it changed.

No more tapping.

No more ""Hello?""

Just a thump. A weight. Something leaning against the front door.

Then-

""Joe.""

The voice didn't belong to a child anymore.

It was John.

""Joe-man, it's me. Please. I didn't know where else to go.""
His voice cracked like a branch splitting under pressure. ""Please open the door.""

My hands went numb.

He said my name again. And again. Always with the same rhythm. Same crack. Same tone.

""Please. Please open the door.""

I stared at the deadbolt.

My wife sat upright, her hand trembling now. She shook her head, just once. Hard.

""Joe-I think it broke my leg,"" the voice said next. ""I think it's out there somewhere. Please.""

But he didn't knock.

And he didn't move.

And that's how I knew.

Whatever was out there, whatever had chased John into those woods-it didn't need to find him. It had learned him. Learned his panic, his words, his voice, his fear.

Now it was wearing him.

The kids stared at me, silent. Their faces pale in the candlelight. The tapping had stopped completely.

The voice spoke again.

""Joe?""

It said my name in the same tone the girl had used.

The exact same tone.
Around 4:45 a.m., the woods changed.

Not the way city folks mean when they talk about sunrise-no birdsong, no golden sky. In these mountains, dawn doesn't arrive. It climbs. It crawls its way up the ridges and slips through the trees like a ghost. And until it crests the ridge behind our house, it's still night.

The voice hadn't spoken in half an hour.

That silence was the worst part.

We all sat in the living room, blankets wrapped tight, the kids drowsy but too afraid to sleep. My wife had one hand on my son's shoulder, her eyes on the door. I hadn't moved in twenty minutes. Didn't breathe right. Couldn't.

It was waiting.

That much I knew in my bones. Not gone. Not walking away. Just waiting for the right shape to wear. The right voice. The final thread.

Then came the whisper.

Not at the window. Not the door. It came from inside.

From the hallway.

Soft. Measured.

""...Daddy?""

My heart stopped.

It wasn't my daughter.

It sounded like her. But she was asleep, her head in my wife's lap. I looked down at her-heard the shallow, panicked breath of a child pretending not to be awake.

Another whisper. From deeper down the hall, just around the corner.
""Daddy... can you help me?""

I stood slowly. My wife shook her head again, her grip tightening on the kids.

""I'm stuck,"" the voice said. Higher now. Fragile. ""I can't get out.""

I stepped toward the hall. My boots silent on the old pine floor.

""I'm scared.""

Three words. Just three. But they came too smooth. Too rehearsed. Like someone trying not to get the words wrong.

I crept down the hallway, hand tight on the shotgun. I passed the kids' bedroom door. The sound came again.

""Daddy?""

From the basement door.

That door was always shut. Locked from the inside.

I stood there, breathing slow. My father's words echoed from a time I hadn't thought of in years.
""Don't ever open a door just because something on the other side knows your name.""

I didn't.

Instead, I dropped to my knees and pressed one ear to the wood.

It went quiet.

Then something scraped, slow and low, just beyond the frame.

Like fingernails on stone.

Then the voice spoke one more time.

""Help me daddy im stuck""
Pleading so close to my daughters voice. But not quite just enough off to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. 

I stood and backed away. Never turned my back on that door.

---

At 6:13 a.m., the first light broke the treetops.

The tapping never returned.

But the woods never went back to normal either.

Downvote.
Another story from u/ GallowsGlyph dropped a point. Nate grinned. He never read the horror pieces‚Äîjust hit the arrow, savoring the image of some earnest writer grinding their teeth.

Morning smelled of burnt toast. As Nate scraped blackened crumbs into the sink, he noticed a fresh gouge across the breadboard: ùôÑùôâùôÉùòºùôáùôÄ‚Äîcarved deep, as though by a claw.

On the commute, traffic froze behind a jack-knifed semi. Its side panel showed spray-painted carnage‚Äîa stick figure dragged through a meat grinder, red paint still dripping like hot grease. Exactly the thumbnail GallowsGlyph had posted yesterday (before Nate buried it). Coincidence, he told himself.

That night, dreams were crowded. Faceless things pressed against him, whispering sentences he didn‚Äôt know but somehow remembered. In the blank microwave glass he caught the outline of a rail-thin silhouette, username floating above its head.

Phone buzzed. Another Glyph drop: ‚ÄúThe Man Who Lived on Other Minds.‚Äù Nate‚Äôs finger hovered‚Äîthen punched the arrow. Bedroom paint bubbled like skin meeting flame.

He called in sick, scrubbing scorch marks no sponge could lift. Every reflective surface showed the pale figure a little clearer.

At twilight a notification pinged: u/ GallowsGlyph is typing‚Ä¶ The message never arrived. Instead, a knock rattled the apartment door.

The author stood there‚Äîrail-thin, eyes the color of woodsmoke. ‚ÄúI tried kindness,‚Äù he said, stepping inside uninvited. ‚ÄúThen I tried ignoring you. But you kept dragging them back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the scribe,‚Äù GallowsGlyph whispered. ‚ÄúThe stories are the real mouths. I wrote them to spit nightmares out of my skull. They need release‚Äîupticks of breath. Every downvote you gave was an inhale, sucking them into you.‚Äù

Words shifted inside Nate‚Äôs bones‚Äîparagraphs flexing.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one last door.‚Äù He placed a battered leather journal on the coffee table. ‚ÄúWrite. Bleed them onto the page. Maybe they‚Äôll stay there. But hurry‚Äîstories hate unfinished business.‚Äù He turned, fading down the corridor like smeared ink‚Äîthe same silhouette Nate had glimpsed all day.

Nate snatched a pen. Dark sentences poured out, splattering across paper faster than thought. The lights flickered. From the hallway came timid footsteps‚Äîneighbors, perhaps‚Äîdrawn by the frantic scratching.

If even one of them peeked in and judged, an arrow could tilt. Red or gray, it didn‚Äôt matter. The stories would feel it.

I‚Äôve opened my fair share of prismatic in the U.S. with next to nothing luck. To wrap  this up if you‚Äôre in Japan and at a convenience store and happen to see Pokemon packs , just buy it. And rip it. Also, I have 6 sealed packs left. I might just hang on to these as memories in Japan. ",3,1750161712.0,pokemoncards,4,1.0,False

My mom warned me (she‚Äôs a nurse) it could ruin me and she was right. 

I continued taking it, sometimes on time other times not. But then I started developing extreme social anxiety, drowsiness so bad I could barely lift my head up, blurred vision, unable to see things right in front of me, heart palpitations so bad I was waiting to die everyday. I would also run away from people and the drowsy eyes symptoms convinced my brain I was a creep and couldn‚Äôt look at people or touch ppl. This went on continuously for 7 years and I started to lose friendships and family bc of how weird the symptoms made me act. I told my doctor many times but was gaslit. My family didn‚Äôt want to take me to the hospital, ig it was a punishment for taking the meds when they told me not too.I was thrown many different meds which worsened my condition, slept most of those 7 years of my life away.

This went up until college, I did many things I regret but the most painful part is not accepting a scholarship bc I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to maintain it bc the symptoms I was having. (I unknowingly had long covid at the time too, which stays dormant in the body for a long time).That day the muscle rigidity and tight burning sensation was so painful I laid on the ground crying bc I felt like I didn‚Äôt have a choice. My parents put the paper on the coffee table as I struggled to walk up the stairs with it, but they never brought it up to me. I wanted to go to this school but the symptoms were holding me back. I think this one decision ruined my life. From then onwards my parents would put me in a college that I had no say in, which I would do well in my freshman year, but end up withdrawing out of frustration due to bullying last minute. Which I now also regret. I now have to go to a college I‚Äôm not sure about and rebuild my life. ",1,1750161660.0,confessions,0,1.0,False
1ldl8tj,https://i.redd.it/vl1esrrz8h7f1.jpeg,"$ATYR Institutional Ownership Deep Dive: The Mechanics, Mix & Major Holders (Part 2/2)","[Jump back to Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATYR_Alpha/s/2PXVQ06owa)

Welcome to Part 2. If you missed the full intro, context, and quantitative breakdown, [start with Part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATYR_Alpha/s/2PXVQ06owa). This section covers the deep-dive category analysis, the behavioural read on the register, implications for the current setup, key scenarios, and actionable insights.

---

**6. Deep Dive: Category-by-Category Analysis**

To truly understand what the institutional register is signalling, we need to go beyond raw numbers. Each category of owner brings its own playbook, constraints, and strategic intent to the table. Reading these distinctions is critical‚Äîbecause in a name like $ATYR, the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each cohort‚Äôs move is as important as the move itself.

---

**a) Passive Index & ETF Funds**

*Key Players:* Vanguard Group Inc, BlackRock, State Street, iShares, Geode, Schwab, Fidelity Index portfolios.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  These funds are pure rule-followers: they allocate capital based on index inclusion, market cap, and rebalance calendars. They don‚Äôt make discretionary decisions about $ATYR‚Äîif the weighting goes up, they buy; if it goes down, they sell. Their presence is ‚Äúautomatic,‚Äù but it creates a price floor and baseline liquidity.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  We‚Äôve seen gradual increases in passive positions (e.g. Vanguard up 11.15%, VTSMX up 21.75%, State Street up 22.23%). This is likely driven by small-cap biotech re-weightings and, to a lesser extent, the stock‚Äôs rising profile in indices. These flows are non-judgmental and not a ‚Äúvote‚Äù on fundamentals, but when passive AUM rises, it generally dampens volatility‚Äîat least until a catalyst event hits.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  Passive flows don‚Äôt read the tea leaves, but their steady bid means there‚Äôs always a baseline of shares off the table. If you see a big drop in passive ownership, it usually signals an index exclusion or a market cap event.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  Passive funds are always ‚Äúfloor-setters‚Äù not leaders‚Äîthey follow the index, not the story.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  Don‚Äôt over-interpret moves here, but do recognise that a rising passive base means it will take more ‚Äúreal money‚Äù flow to drive major price swings outside of catalysts.

---

**b) Active Long-Only Managers**

*Key Players:* FMR LLC (Fidelity), Wellington, UBS, Wells Fargo, MAI Capital, Renaissance Technologies (to a degree).

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  These are the ‚Äústock-pickers‚Äù‚Äîthey buy because they see value, hold through noise, and may scale in or out around catalysts based on their own research. Some (like Fidelity and Wellington) are true sector leaders in biotech allocation, while others may ride trends or use window-dressing near quarter-end.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  There‚Äôs been quiet but significant scaling in by names like FMR (+6.58%), UBS (+613%), Wells Fargo (+59%), and MAI Capital (+306,100%). While the outsize jump from MAI may be an outlier, the cluster of increases across leading long-onlys suggests conviction-building, not just tracking.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  When active managers buy in size, it‚Äôs rarely by accident‚Äîthey want meaningful exposure into the next readout. Their activity here is a subtle ‚Äúvote of confidence,‚Äù even if not all are core biotech specialists.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  Fidelity and Wellington are often leaders‚Äîfirst to size up, sometimes first to trim if thesis erodes. Watch for simultaneous buying across multiple long-onlys as a powerful ‚Äúsignal stack.‚Äù

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  These holders are often a ‚Äútell‚Äù for where serious money sees a risk-adjusted edge. Steady accumulation here should not be ignored, especially when accompanied by falling passive/quant exposure.

---

**c) Hedge Funds / Multi-Strat Funds**

*Key Players:* Octagon Capital Advisors, Millennium, Point72, Marshall Wace, Alyeska, Schonfeld, Citadel, Goldman Sachs, Balyasny, Woodline.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  These funds specialise in ‚Äúevent-driven‚Äù moves‚Äîpositioning for data readouts, M&A, or liquidity inflections. They frequently pair long positions with derivatives (calls/puts) or even outright shorts, aiming to profit from volatility as much as direction. Some (like Citadel and Millennium) are famous for moving in size only when they see asymmetric upside.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Several funds have dramatically increased their positions: Octagon (+294%), Millennium (+334%), Citadel (+2,011%), Goldman (+46%), Balyasny (+412%). Others, like Point72 (-41.76%), appear to have trimmed or rebalanced‚Äîsometimes locking in gains, sometimes re-risking post-catalyst.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  The ‚Äúhot money‚Äù has arrived. Rapid build-up by these players usually means a major event is in focus and volatility is expected. Sometimes this is front-running a catalyst, other times it‚Äôs hedged, but the size of the move almost always raises the stakes.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  Millennium, Citadel, and Octagon are pure leaders‚Äîwhen they go big, others notice and often follow. Smaller hedge funds often ride these moves or add in the slipstream.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  Spotting when the real event-driven money is scaling in gives you a lead on expected volatility. Conversely, seeing major trims or exits (as with Point72) can sometimes be a yellow flag for near-term chop.

---

**d) Quant / Proprietary Trading Firms**

*Key Players:* Susquehanna, Qube, Squarepoint, Jane Street, GSA Capital, Renaissance Technologies (partially), HRT, Wolverine.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  Quant funds are pure ‚Äútape traders.‚Äù They play order flow, short-term mean reversion, volatility spikes, and arbitrage mispricings‚Äîrarely holding conviction positions, often cycling through shares rapidly.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Susquehanna (+119%), Qube (-3.59%), Squarepoint (+783%), Jane Street (-12%), Wolverine (+140%). This is a classic sign of high activity and turnover ahead of a known event. When these positions grow en masse, it‚Äôs often a sign the tape is getting noisier‚Äîfast money is in, spreads may widen, and moves become less predictable.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  A big quant presence is a double-edged sword: it can provide liquidity and tight spreads, but it can also mean wild swings, ‚Äúfalse‚Äù breakouts, and difficult trading for retail.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  These are high-turnover, not ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in the directional sense. But their presence often ‚Äúprimes‚Äù the tape for others to make real moves.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  When quants dominate the tape, be careful with stops and expectations. The edge comes from understanding when this cohort is leaving (volatility drops) or when they‚Äôre scaling up (expect fireworks).

---

**e) Healthcare / Biotech Specialists**

*Key Players:* Federated Hermes, Tikvah, Tang Capital, Ally Bridge, Integral Health, Erste, Steadfast, FBIOX, KAUAX, FKASX.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  Sector specialists are deep-research players. They know the pipeline, the science, and management teams‚Äîoften participating in rounds or accumulating quietly on their own timelines. They may hold through brutal drawdowns if they believe in the underlying science.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Most sector specialists have held or quietly built (Federated 0%, Tikvah 0%, Tang 0%, Ally Bridge +11%, Integral +87%). KAUAX and FKASX remain large, stable positions, signifying long-term sector conviction rather than a quick flip.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  Rising or stable stakes by specialists are among the best possible signals for sector health and story validation. If you ever see an exodus here, that is the real red flag.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  True sector specialists are almost always leaders. Their presence and size are often studied closely by all other institutional classes.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  Following the smart, long-term money gives you a fighting chance to stay ahead of retail herds and avoid being whipsawed by trading noise.

---

**f) Family Offices / Small Asset Managers**

*Key Players:* Jain Global, Dauntless, Main Street, Sachetta, Kingswood, Cannon Global, Apollon.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  These are nimble, sometimes contrarian investors‚Äîoften able to get meaningful exposure relative to their AUM. Their moves can be idiosyncratic, based on deep dives or unique information.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Activity is less visible in this group, but most positions are stable or quietly building. Jain Global, for example, holds 88K shares.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  When family offices start to cluster in a name, it can be a sign of under-the-radar conviction. They‚Äôre rarely ‚Äútourists.‚Äù

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  These are often early movers or local information specialists‚Äînot trend-followers.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  These holders are worth tracking for ‚Äúhidden hands‚Äù and possible unique insights‚Äîsometimes they see the turn before bigger funds catch on.

---

**g) Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth, Insurance**

*Key Players:* OMERS, Northern Trust, Bank of America Pension, United Bank.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  Conservative, long-term, focused on stability and low drawdown. They rarely chase events, prefer to enter on established trends, and can provide meaningful ballast in choppy markets.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Northern Trust (+2.19%), OMERS (+7.32%). Generally small increases, which is typical unless the stock is being added to an index or specific mandate.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  A rising stake in this group helps smooth volatility. Their exit would only matter if it coincided with large passive outflows.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  Rarely leaders‚Äîmost often enter on established momentum or following index inclusions.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  Stability is underrated; this group keeps the floor from falling out in risk-off scenarios.

---

**h) Market-Makers / Liquidity Providers**

*Key Players:* Jane Street, Wolverine, HRT, Simplex, Group One.

- **Typical Strategies:**  
  Not thesis-driven‚Äîthese firms are here to ‚Äúmake a market.‚Äù They manage inventory, hedge risk, and facilitate volume, often holding large but short-term positions.

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Jane Street (-12%), Wolverine (+140%), HRT (new positions). Expect their books to churn rapidly, especially around catalysts.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  A spike in market-maker volume can mean institutions are repositioning, and that the tape will be loose into a catalyst.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  Neither; they react to flows, not stories.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  Great liquidity for getting in/out, but don‚Äôt mistake their presence for a directional vote.

---

**i) New Entrants/Exits**

*Key Examples:* Octagon (new), MAI Capital (massive position), Citadel (huge increase), Point72 (large reduction), Two Sigma and Adage (full exit).

- **Recent Activity in $ATYR:**  
  Octagon‚Äôs arrival (3.55M shares, +294%), Citadel (+2,011%), and MAI Capital (+306,100%) all signal ‚Äúfresh money‚Äù conviction ahead of catalysts. At the same time, Point72‚Äôs large trim and Two Sigma/Adage‚Äôs exit are notable.

- **Implication for Sentiment/Risk:**  
  Major new entrants with biotech credibility are often early to the story. Large, rapid exits from established holders can warn of changing risk/reward.

- **Leadership/Follower:**  
  New entrants with scale and specialist credentials often lead the next wave of re-rating.

- **Edge for Retail:**  
  Spotting new ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù flow before the news hits is the holy grail for retail edge.

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
Spotting which cohort is leading‚Äîand which is following‚Äîlets you anticipate where the next meaningful price move will come from. Most retail investors simply see a list of names, but the real informational edge comes from knowing that not all flows are created equal. Institutions know this; so should we.

---

**7. Interpreting the Shifts**

At this level, the real value of register analysis comes not from a static snapshot, but from pattern recognition‚Äîlinking each fund‚Äôs move to price, news, and market behaviour, and teasing out what it really says about the state of play. Institutions themselves spend huge resources doing exactly this: not just ‚Äúwho bought and sold,‚Äù but why, when, and how it fits the evolving narrative.

---

**Price Action: Accumulation, Momentum, and Mean Reversion**

One of the first questions I always ask when reviewing 13F/NPORT data is: Did these institutions buy into strength, or were they quietly accumulating on weakness? The answer shapes both the read of their conviction and what might be coming next.

- **Octagon Capital Advisors:** Their 294% increase‚Äîtaking their holding to 3.55 million shares‚Äîcame during a period of relative price softness. This ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù pattern is classic for event-driven hedge funds: they often accumulate during pullbacks, preparing for a re-rate into the next data event.
- **Citadel Advisors:** The extraordinary 2,011% jump in holdings was also matched to a phase of increased volume, but not outright momentum‚Äîsuggesting a build-up in anticipation rather than a late-stage chase. In my view, this aligns with their historical pattern of taking large, asymmetric event bets when implied volatility is low and risk/reward skews positive.
- **Point72:** The 41% reduction in shares is telling‚Äîmost of it came during a period when the price was relatively flat. This often indicates either a portfolio rebalance (taking profits after an earlier run) or a risk management decision ahead of uncertainty.

In each case, the price context matters: aggressive builds into weakness typically signal higher confidence and a willingness to be early. Buying into strength can mean momentum-following, but in small-float biotech, it often leads to a short-term top.

---

**Newsflow and Catalyst Timing**

Next, I overlay moves with the newsflow calendar‚Äîdid these funds position ahead of catalysts, or after? Timing is a massive tell.

- **Octagon and Citadel** both accumulated ahead of key catalysts‚Äîmost notably, before the positive SSC-ILD cohort data. This kind of ‚Äúpre-positioning‚Äù is what institutions call ‚Äúgetting in front of the tape.‚Äù It suggests a degree of foresight, or at the very least, high conviction that the risk/reward was skewed favourably into readout.
- **MAI Capital Management:** The astonishing 306,100% surge appears to coincide with growing buy-side buzz around efzofitimod‚Äôs broader platform potential. When funds move at this scale prior to major conferences or readouts, it‚Äôs rarely random‚Äîoften, they‚Äôre either privy to better scenario modelling or have conviction that consensus is underpricing the outcome.
- **Point72‚Äôs reduction** occurred as the headline/newsflow started to thin out. That kind of trimming is often read by other funds as a defensive move‚Äîpotentially a sign that an expected catalyst is ‚Äúin the price,‚Äù or that risk/reward is shifting.

In my view, these cross-references help to separate proactive conviction (buying before the news) from reactive positioning (adding or exiting after the move is already priced).

---

**Options Activity: Hedging vs. Positioning for Asymmetry**

Options flow gives yet another dimension‚Äîare these institutions hedging, or are they taking shots at an outsized win?

- **Citadel, Susquehanna, Wolverine** and other options-heavy firms show significant increases in both calls and puts. Citadel‚Äôs surge in both equity and options positioning fits a classic ‚Äúevent-vol‚Äù strategy: build a core position, then use derivatives to amplify exposure or protect downside. This is not ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs structured for asymmetric outcomes.
- **Susquehanna‚Äôs** high turnover in both equity and options reflects their status as both market-maker and event trader‚Äîthey‚Äôre there for liquidity and volatility, but large open interest in biotech calls is often a sign of positioning for a binary readout.
- **Wolverine Trading‚Äôs** leap in calls matches the historical pattern of ‚Äúcheap optionality‚Äù‚Äîtaking directional bets when event probability is high but outcomes are extreme.

What stands out is that the most sophisticated players rarely take naked directional risk‚Äîthey structure portfolios to profit from volatility, not just price. For retail, this means that heavy options activity should be read as a sign that ‚Äúsomething is coming‚Äù‚Äîbut not always as a clear directional vote.

---

**Case Studies: Playbooks in Action**

- **Citadel‚Äôs Huge Increase:** Citadel‚Äôs profile is well known‚Äîwhen they go big, it‚Äôs not by accident. Historically, they move before volatility spikes, use complex hedging, and often front-run key catalysts. Their move here is a signal: expect movement.
- **Point72‚Äôs Trim:** Point72 are known for both high-quality research and quick feet. Their reduction could be profit-taking, a view that near-term catalysts are ‚Äúpriced in,‚Äù or simply risk management. The important detail: they did not exit completely, implying continued belief in the long-term setup.
- **Octagon‚Äôs Leap:** As a new entrant, Octagon‚Äôs scale and timing suggest a ‚Äúhigh conviction, high risk/reward‚Äù play. They‚Äôre not known for dabbling‚Äîthey swing for size when the asymmetric payoff is clear.
- **MAI Capital:** Such a wild percentage increase could be a small fund scaling up, or a larger move by a player with an idiosyncratic thesis. Either way, these outsized jumps often precede the next re-rating or draw focus from other institutions looking to piggyback conviction.

---

**Timing, Sentiment, and the Information Edge**

Ultimately, the edge is not in ‚Äúknowing what‚Äôs already happened,‚Äù but in understanding what each cohort‚Äôs move implies for sentiment, volatility, and risk going forward. Institutions interrogate the register for a reason: to catch new leaders, spot defensive rotations, and arbitrage signals that retail rarely sees. The goal is always to be ahead of the crowd‚Äîreading the register not as a census, but as a living, breathing map of market intent.

For us, the retail edge comes from focusing on the why, not just the what. By tracking shifts in timing, scale, and the specific playbooks of these funds, we give ourselves a fighting chance to separate signal from noise, and‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîcatch the next wave before it breaks.

---

**8. Implications: Why It Matters Now**

Understanding the institutional makeup of $ATYR‚Äôs register isn‚Äôt just a matter of tracking who owns what‚Äîit‚Äôs about interpreting the market‚Äôs structural DNA and positioning ourselves accordingly. Every cycle in biotech brings new faces to the register, but it‚Äôs the mix that reveals the deeper story.

---

**Stability: Foundation or Fast Money?**

Looking across the current institutional register, several signals stand out. There is a solid base of long-term, price-insensitive holders: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and a swathe of index funds collectively account for a significant percentage of the float. Their presence acts as ballast‚Äîproviding steady liquidity and damping wild swings, especially in quieter periods. The presence of long-only managers and healthcare specialists (Federated Hermes, Tikvah, Ally Bridge, Tang, FBIOX) further reinforces this sense of foundational stability. These players tend to ‚Äúknow what they own‚Äù and typically only exit on fundamental change.

However, overlying this base is a visible layer of event-driven, fast-moving capital: Citadel, Millennium, Octagon, MAI Capital, and others. The size and velocity of their recent moves‚Äîespecially outsized leaps in share count‚Äîpoint to a market braced for volatility. This is not ‚Äúhot money‚Äù in the casual sense, but capital that is highly sensitive to catalysts and will not hesitate to pivot as the narrative evolves.

In my view, the presence of both camps is significant. It means that, while there is real depth on the buy side, the register is far from ‚Äúset and forget.‚Äù When the right catalyst arrives, the fast money can amplify moves‚Äîup or down‚Äîat a scale most retail investors are not prepared for.

---

**Accumulation Potential: Is There Room for More?**

The question of whether more ‚Äúbig money‚Äù can or will enter is critical. Given the current concentration‚Äîled by a handful of mega-holders, but with a tail of mid-sized funds and specialists‚Äîthere remains meaningful room for further accumulation. In practice, when float is concentrated in strong hands but not yet ‚Äúlocked up,‚Äù it sets the stage for a scramble as the next major event approaches.

What stands out in $ATYR is the diversity of the holder base. You have index funds and passive managers anchoring liquidity, but also active specialists and hedge funds who have only recently scaled in. In previous high-profile biotech runs (think: Reata, ImmunoGen, even Sarepta), we‚Äôve seen late-stage pile-ins by crossover funds and momentum players as the setup matures. $ATYR‚Äôs current structure leaves the door open for that kind of reflexive inflow‚Äîespecially if the next data readout is clean and the story spreads beyond specialist circles.

---

**Setup for Sharp Moves: Institutional Squeeze and Reflexivity**

With a register like this, the conditions are primed for sharp moves around catalysts. Here‚Äôs why:
- **Institutional Squeeze:** When both event-driven funds and specialists are sizing up, but liquidity is capped by passive holders, even moderate buying can spark outsized price responses. If the catalyst is positive, the scramble for shares can be fierce‚Äîespecially as latecomers chase exposure, indexers rebalance, and quants amplify the move.
- **Reflexivity:** As price rises, momentum traders and systematic funds are triggered in, which can rapidly escalate the move‚Äîa ‚Äúpile-on‚Äù dynamic that‚Äôs written into the history of biotech trading.
- **Behavioural Triggers:** Long-only managers and specialists often add on confirmation, not before. Their buying can be delayed, but when it comes, it adds further fuel to the trend. This setup, in my view, creates real potential for a classic biotech re-rating cycle: drift, pop, scramble.

The presence of sophisticated event-driven funds, active specialists, and a large passive base is a classic formula for sudden and dramatic price dislocations around major events. The retail edge is in being early to this structural story.

---

**Comparisons: Is $ATYR Unusual?**

Relative to other catalyst-heavy biotechs, $ATYR‚Äôs structure is unusually well-positioned for a major move. The combination of a large, steady passive block, a growing cohort of conviction specialists, and the entry of aggressive hedge funds is reminiscent of the setups in some of biotech‚Äôs most explosive post-catalyst runs.

Historically, when a name like this transitions from a niche specialist story to broader institutional acceptance‚Äîwhile maintaining high event-driven attention‚Äîmultiple expansion and volume surges tend to follow. This is not a guarantee, but structurally, $ATYR is set up for something more than just a routine data event. In my opinion, we are sitting on the edge of a register that‚Äôs far more dynamic, and potentially volatile, than the market is currently pricing in.

---

**Information Edge: Reading the Register, Not Just the Tape**

This is where the information edge comes in. Most market participants‚Äîeven some professionals‚Äîwill look at price and volume, but never dig deeper into the register. They react to what‚Äôs happening, rather than understanding why it‚Äôs happening. For the retail community, taking this kind of structural lens‚Äîbreaking down not just ‚Äúwho owns what,‚Äù but the type, scale, and motivation behind the moves‚Äîoffers a meaningful edge.

In my view, this is the kind of reading of the tea leaves that can deliver real advantage over the crowd. It is information asymmetry in action: using public data in a more sophisticated way, and anticipating market moves that others only recognise after the fact.

---

**9. Insights and Hypotheses**

Bringing together everything we‚Äôve uncovered so far, the current institutional register at $ATYR is not just a list of names and numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic map. Every shift, every new entrant, every outsized increase or quiet trim reveals part of a bigger narrative. The goal here is not just to catalogue, but to interpret‚Äîto translate ownership data into forward-looking scenarios and actionable insight.

---

**What Is the ‚ÄúSmart Money‚Äù Expecting?**

In my view, the prevailing expectation among the most sophisticated holders is for a major inflection point on the next meaningful data or regulatory event. The sheer scale of conviction-driven stakes from specialists (Federated Hermes, Tikvah, Ally Bridge) and the rapid accumulation by event-driven funds (Octagon, Millennium, Citadel) suggests these groups are not positioning for marginal upside‚Äîthey are betting on the possibility of a step-change in valuation.

What makes this setup especially interesting is the breadth of conviction: it‚Äôs not just one or two funds ‚Äúsizing up‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs multiple, uncorrelated strategies converging. This usually implies an internal consensus that something bigger than a routine catalyst is in play. When this kind of setup emerges, institutional memory says the crowd is expecting more than just a win‚Äîthey are looking for a narrative expansion, perhaps into new indications, broader platform validation, or a scenario that forces the market to completely re-rate the opportunity.

---

**Hidden Tells: Reading the Register for Subtle Signals**

The most revealing signals often hide in the register itself, not in the chart. For example:
- **Octagon‚Äôs sudden 294% increase** is the kind of outlier behaviour you rarely see without insider-level confidence in a near-term event.
- **Citadel‚Äôs 2,000%+ position increase** does not come from index mechanics or passive drift‚Äîthis is a deliberate, aggressive bet, often accompanied by significant options activity to amplify (or hedge) exposure.
- **Point72‚Äôs reduction** is a classic ‚Äúrebalancing‚Äù move from a fund that often leads into events, takes profit on strength, and is content to reload if thesis confirms.
- **The continued rise of specialists (Federated, Tikvah) with ‚Äústicky‚Äù hands**‚Äîthese funds don‚Äôt chase noise; their ongoing presence signals faith in the underlying science, not just price momentum.

What this implies, in my opinion, is that risk appetite is high among the best-informed players. They are not just ‚Äúin‚Äù for a trade‚Äîthey are in for a potential regime shift. But, crucially, the structure also means that if the thesis cracks, the unwind could be rapid. These funds have the ability to add in size‚Äîbut also to exit without warning, which can make for extreme volatility.

**Scenarios: What Could Go Right (or Wrong) from Here?**

**Best-Case Scenario:**  
A clean data readout, regulatory green light, or out-of-the-blue strategic transaction (e.g., partnership or takeout) catalyses a wave of forced buying. Indexes rebalance, momentum funds and new specialists pile in, and a ‚Äúscarcity premium‚Äù takes hold as available float disappears. In this scenario, the price action is reflexive‚Äîeach uptick creates its own demand, and the move can be swift and sustained, often blowing past sell-side price targets before most retail investors can react.

**Middle-of-the-Road Scenario:**  
Incremental data or a ‚Äúnot bad, not great‚Äù catalyst event keeps the long-term specialists in place, but event-driven money trims or hedges. The stock finds a new equilibrium, perhaps with a slow upward bias, but without the ‚Äúpop‚Äù that drives narrative expansion. The key here is to watch for how much capital stays vs. how much rotates out‚Äîthe register will tell you if conviction is holding.

**Worst-Case Scenario:**  
A failed or ambiguous event, or a sudden strategic misstep, prompts a fast unwind. The very same funds that drove conviction buying can also accelerate the exit. With so much ‚Äúhot‚Äù capital on the register, price can gap lower as event-driven money races to the door, and even some specialists are forced to trim. This is why register dynamics are not just about upside‚Äîthey‚Äôre about managing risk on the downside, too.

**What Should Retail Actually Do With This Knowledge?**

Here‚Äôs the actionable bit, in my view. Most retail investors focus only on price, or perhaps on volume. But when you start to track the register‚Äîand see who is leading, who is following, and what kind of moves are being made‚Äîyou arm yourself with context that is simply not available to the average market participant.
- **Watch the Leaders:** When conviction specialists or event-driven hedge funds move in size, it‚Äôs rarely for no reason. Tracking their quarterly (or even monthly) shifts can reveal inflection points before the crowd sees them in price.
- **Mind the Exits:** If high-turnover funds start dumping, or if specialists quietly scale back, that‚Äôs a ‚Äútell‚Äù for rising risk.
- **Track the Float:** As more of the float gets locked in by strong hands, the risk of a squeeze rises. Retail can get ahead of this by watching the data and acting before the headlines.

In my opinion, the retail community has the chance to close the information gap not just by reading, but by sharing, discussing, and analysing together‚Äîsurfacing insights that even the biggest funds sometimes miss.

---

**Closing the Gap: Level the Playing Field, Together**

This level of analysis was once the exclusive preserve of the hedge funds and quant desks, but it need not stay that way. When we work together‚Äîaggregating filings, cross-referencing news, watching options flow, and overlaying behavioural context‚Äîretail can match or even outpace the ‚Äúsmart money.‚Äù This is what information asymmetry is all about: using public data to build an edge that the crowd doesn‚Äôt see.

In my view, this is the best use of community. By sharing intelligence and staying alert to the moves beneath the surface, we can convert a handful of SEC filings and a bit of legwork into a real-world trading and investing edge. The more eyes, the sharper the edge‚Äîand the less likely we are to be caught on the wrong side of a big move.

---

**10.mFraming the Path Forward**

After dissecting $ATYR‚Äôs institutional register from every angle, the state of play is both nuanced and telling. We‚Äôre looking at a company with a uniquely diverse and dynamic shareholder base‚Äîranging from conviction-driven specialists, to aggressive event-driven hedge funds, to the stabilising ballast of the passive giants. It‚Äôs a blend that creates both opportunity and risk, setting the stage for potentially sharp moves on the next data or corporate event.

The narrative threads running through the register are clear: some of the ‚Äúsmartest money‚Äù in biotech is betting on more than a simple binary outcome, while the trading cohorts are laying groundwork for volatility. The way I see it, the key takeaways for the community are:
- Watch for further accumulation by leading specialists and hedge funds‚Äîit signals deepening conviction or imminent news.
- Monitor volume and options spikes around newsflow windows‚Äîthis is often the smoke before the fire.
- Track concentration changes‚Äîif the float tightens further among ‚Äústicky‚Äù hands, we could be set for a reflexive squeeze on positive surprise.

As a community, our next step is to keep this edge alive: crowdsource, cross-check, and share. Whether it‚Äôs a spike in new filings, an unexpected trim by a major player, or an options trade that doesn‚Äôt fit the prevailing narrative, every data point brings us closer to the real story. In my view, if you want an edge in biotech, ownership analysis is not optional‚Äîit‚Äôs the map the smart money uses to navigate volatility, opportunity, and risk.

This is the value of community: we‚Äôre not just watching headlines, we‚Äôre reading the map beneath the surface.

**11. Next Steps**

I‚Äôd love to hear what you‚Äôre seeing in the register‚Äîare there data points or moves I‚Äôve missed? Are you tracking unusual trends in ownership, options, or volume that deserve a closer look? The best insights often come from the collective: the more eyes on the register, the smaller the edge for Wall Street.

If you found this research valuable, if it‚Äôs helped you to sharpen your own decision-making, or if you want to help me keep these deep dives coming, consider supporting with a [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo). Every contribution goes straight back into tools, data, and the hours I put into this for the community. It‚Äôs still a labour of love, but community support genuinely makes a difference. If you can‚Äôt tell, I put a lot of effort into this content.

Let‚Äôs keep levelling the playing field! Post your questions, counterpoints, and new findings below - I‚Äôm always keen to hear from you.

**Disclaimers**
- Not investment advice. Do your own research, and always consult a professional financial adviser before making any investment decisions.
- Data accuracy: Every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and completeness, but if you spot an error or see something I‚Äôve missed, add it below‚Äîcrowdsourcing makes us all stronger.
- On information asymmetry: Institutions don‚Äôt get it right every time, but their process for analysing ownership structure is a source of real edge. The more we learn to dissect these patterns together, the better decisions we‚Äôll make‚Äîindividually and as a community.

1ldl7ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMSuccessConnection/comments/1ldl7ix/ohsoreal_ugc_review_nextlevel_ugc_creation/,OhSoReal UGC Review - Next-Level UGC Creation Software!,"User-Generated Content (UGC) has exploded in popularity recently, and if you're looking to elevate your content creation game, then¬†[OhSoReal](https://imsuccessconnection.com/OhSoReal)¬†might just be the tool you need. In this¬†**OhSoReal UGC Review**, we‚Äôll dive into how this innovative software allows you to create fully custom UGC personas from scratch, clone voices, and produce engaging promotional videos with stunning realism. Whether you're an affiliate marketer, content creator, or a brand looking to showcase products in fresh, unique ways, OhSoReal offers an impressive set of features to help you stand out.¬†[**https://imsuccessconnection.com/OhSoReal**](https://imsuccessconnection.com/OhSoReal)

# What is OhSoReal?

OhSoReal is a groundbreaking UGC creation platform that enables users to design lifelike digital personas to showcase products in videos. Unlike traditional templates or preset characters, this software lets you build your own characters from the ground up. Want a confident young woman with long brown hair? Or maybe an older gentleman? You can specify every detail, including the character's appearance, clothing style, and even the way they hold a product.

One of the standout features of OhSoReal is the ability to upload your own product images‚Äîwhether it's a Bluetooth speaker, a miniature car, or even a coffee mug‚Äîand have your digital persona hold and present it naturally in the video. This flexibility opens up endless possibilities for personalized and authentic product promotion.

# Voice Cloning and Multilingual Capabilities

OhSoReal doesn‚Äôt stop at just visuals. It also includes powerful voice cloning technology. You can clone your own voice by uploading 10 to 30 seconds of audio, allowing your digital personas to speak in your exact tone. Alternatively, the software offers a variety of pre-made voices in multiple languages, enabling you to create content for global audiences effortlessly.

For example, you can generate a voiceover in Spanish, French, or any of the 30 supported languages, broadening your reach and engagement with diverse markets. The lip-sync accuracy is impressive, making the personas appear genuinely conversational and natural.

# Creating a UGC Persona Step-by-Step

Getting started with OhSoReal is intuitive and user-friendly. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the process:

1. **Upload or Generate Audio:**¬†Start by either uploading your own recorded audio or typing a script to generate voiceover using the built-in text-to-speech feature. You can select from a library of voices, including your cloned voice if you have one.
2. **Describe Your Character:**¬†Choose the persona‚Äôs gender and provide detailed descriptions of their appearance, including hair color, style, clothing, and overall vibe.
3. **Upload Product Images:**¬†Add pictures of the product you want your persona to showcase. You can specify how the product is held‚Äîwhether in one hand, two hands, or positioned in front of the chest.
4. **Set the Background:**¬†Define the scene behind your persona, such as a cozy room with natural light or a neutral concrete wall, to match the mood of your video.
5. **Preview and Adjust:**¬†Preview your persona and make any tweaks to appearance, product placement, or script until you‚Äôre satisfied.
6. **Generate Video:**¬†Choose your desired resolution‚Äî720p, 1080p, or 4K‚Äîand generate your video. Rendering times vary but typically take around seven minutes.

# Reusing Characters and Customization

OhSoReal allows you to reuse the same digital characters for different products or campaigns, which is a huge time saver. You can simply switch out the product image, update the script, or adjust the background while keeping the persona consistent. This makes it easy to build a recognizable brand identity through your UGC content.

Additionally, you can add company logos onto clothing, such as t-shirts, to further personalise your videos. For instance, uploading a logo and having your persona wear a t-shirt with it prominently displayed is straightforward and effective for brand promotion.

# Examples of What You Can Create

To illustrate the power of OhSoReal, here are some creative examples:

* A digital persona holding a miniature Formula 1 car, perfect for fans or automotive product promotions.
* A confident young woman showcasing headphones, describing their crisp sound and comfort.
* A character presenting Bluetooth speakers with crystal-clear sound, tailored for tech product marketing.
* A persona holding a branded coffee mug or a craft beer glass, ideal for beverage or lifestyle brands.
* Multilingual videos where the same persona speaks in Spanish or French, reaching international audiences.

These examples demonstrate how OhSoReal can bring your product presentations to life with realistic visuals and compelling voiceovers.

By purchasing OhSoReal through an exclusive link, you gain access to a special training titled ‚Äú10 Ways to Monetize Your UGC Business.‚Äù This training covers practical strategies to leverage your UGC creations for affiliate marketing, client campaigns, social media growth, and more.

# Final Thoughts

In summary, OhSoReal is a truly impressive tool that pushes the boundaries of UGC creation. The ability to craft unique, lifelike digital personas, clone voices, and seamlessly integrate product images is a game-changer for marketers and creators alike.

While there are occasional minor glitches like slight wobbling in animations, the overall quality and flexibility more than make up for it. With support for multiple languages and reusable characters, OhSoReal offers tremendous creative freedom and scalability.

1ldl6kx,https://i.redd.it/efzvpd4a8h7f1.png,I was building yet another AI toy‚Ä¶ until I found a real use case,"Hey folks,

A few months back, I started tinkering with a side project - an AI tool that could turn anything into a podcast-style explainer. I called it ByteCast. It was fun to build, but if I‚Äôm honest, it lacked direction. It felt like a solution waiting for a problem.

Then I started getting feedback from a few early users and folks on Reddit and X. A lot of it boiled down to: *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the actual value here?‚Äù* And that hit me.

At the same time, I noticed I was constantly doomscrolling through tech and world news trying to stay informed but wasting so much time. Most of it was noise. That‚Äôs when the idea clicked:

What if ByteCast focused on just the signal - short, personalized audio updates on what *actually* matters?

So I pivoted.

Now I‚Äôm working on something that gives you **1-minute audio bytes** on trending topics tailored to your interests. Like a personalized audio feed you can check while grabbing coffee. For bigger stories, I‚Äôve added 5-minute deep dives that explain the context clearly without all the fluff.

It‚Äôs still super early. I‚Äôve put it live on the web and am talking to users while figuring out where to take it next.

Would love to hear from this community:

* Do you find short-form audio like this useful?
* What would make you come back to something like this daily?
* Any ideas or feedback as I shape this further?

Now it‚Äôs live. Somehow. It‚Äôs called *Stat Slap.*

Blurb:  
Isabelle‚Äôs life sucked. Then she got isekai‚Äôd into Beaubinte ‚Äî a stat-ridden fantasy hellpit where caves whisper *loot me*, the logs are buggy, and poison arrows count as friendly greetings.

She was supposed to be a side character. Probably.  
Now her sneak stat won‚Äôt stop climbing. Her fireballs keep committing war crimes. And the system? Possibly sentient. Definitely rude.

The prophecy‚Äôs glitched. The Citadel‚Äôs on fire. The gods are watching like it‚Äôs an episode of *Survivor*.

Isabelle? Underdressed. Overleveled. Emotionally unavailable.  
Looting everything that isn‚Äôt nailed down.

This world can die mad about it.

I don‚Äôt expect it to blow up. But if you‚Äôre into weird books full of stats that make you choke on your coffee, this might be your jam.

We were not at all expecting a reaction, but one by one they came over and just looked at us, about a meter away. Some even sat down, and they just stayed there wit us for 10 minutes even when we stopped cooing. They only left when we got up to leave. Is this normal behaviour? Why did they do this?

The only logic from that point on is, he just didn't get time to stretch so he was heavily underperforming in 2016 since he didn't get his morning coffee. Which even makes more sense because the Demons in 2016 weren't an all out invasion, it was a much smaller attack so within reason it serves just as a very long tutorial for The DOOM SLAYER.",2,1750161270.0,Doom,1,0.67,False
1ldl52f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1ldl52f/ic_was_ureaplasma_infection_and_pid_cured/,IC was Ureaplasma infection and PID: Cured Recurrent UTI feeling and Bladder Pain,"1 year cured. 
Wanted to post again, since I remember my post got deleted and mods asked me to wait 6 months.

I thought I had Interstitial Cystitis (IC) for a year. My GP in the Netherlands only ever found leukocytes when I complained of a bladder infection.

The condition became so bad that I was pretty much disabled, had to cancel social functions and sports, couldn‚Äôt have sex, and struggled to fall asleep. I survived on NOW D-Mannose and Desert Harvest Aloe Vera. They helped, but I had to take a lot of D-Mannose just to function (poorly). Cutting out sugar helped manage symptoms a little, reinforcing my suspicion that it might indeed be an infection, given how closely flare ups aligned with high sugar intake.

The struggle was continuous for nearly a year. Two courses of Nitrofurantoin didn‚Äôt help.

I tested for every STD under the sun, including pathogens like Mycoplasma (all kinds), Ureaplasma (all kinds), Trichomoniasis, and Candida. Only Ureaplasma came back positive in two tests. The symptoms started not long after sex, so it made sense in hindsight.

After 10 months, I insisted on treating Ureaplasma after browsing Reddit. I was afraid I might have developed PID from the infection. The GP felt bad but refused to give me more than 7 days of Doxycycline, but the Ureaplasma Bible said it was not enough. (It‚Äôs here on Reddit, look it up)
The Dutch hospital refused to give antibiotics as well, said Ureaplasma could not cause my symptomns.

I was suffering so much. At this point, I was fed up and removed my copper coil, which I had for 3.5 years. I went abroad and bought antibiotics for my partner and me:

	‚Ä¢	For me: 14 days of Doxycycline and 1.5g Azithromycin at the end.
	‚Ä¢	For my partner: 10 days of Doxycycline and 1g Azithromycin.

Per the Ureaplasma Bible, we abstained from sex for months until 4 weeks after finishing the antibiotics. We then tested again for Ureaplasma and finally had sex safely.

IT WORKED. The pain and burning got horribly worse initially, but I trusted the process. Two weeks after finishing the antibiotics, the pain left. I cried with relief. I don‚Äôt even need to think about it anymore. It was the worst struggle I ever went through, lasting a year.
I was living under the burden of horrible flares and a way too tense pelvic floor from all the pain.

I have undergone pelvic floor therapy after being cures as well, since I could not relax my pelvic floor anymore after the whole ordeal.

I still veeeeeeery occasionally can‚Äôt eat large amounts of spicy food or alcohol, as they slightly dehydrate and hurt my bladder. (Maybe once every 3-4 months I get a slightly irritated bladder, but I eat very healthy‚Ä¶) Also, licorice with ammonium chloride, but I started drinking alcohol and coffee again without issues! I‚Äôve finished my Aloe Vera gel and D-Mannose and don‚Äôt need them anymore. I might keep D-Mannose in the cupboard for occasional crazy sex.

I never got a permanent diagnosis except the occasional positive UTI, all on my own initiative. The urologist seemed pretty much completely indifferent about me self-medicating for Ureaplasma and told me to come back if I had complaints.

Don‚Äôt give up. Keep looking for answers and keep testing for all pathogens, food intolerances. Live healthy! Trust your gut. I feel like many women walk around undiagnosed with infections in the Netherlands at least. Consider pathogens and PID!
After the antibiotics try to eat healthy! I heard 30 plants a week help the immune system so much, also stocking up on sourdough and kefir.

Sending love&support.

1ldl4mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ldl4mh/went_on_an_unexpected_date_and_was_pleasantly/,Went on an unexpected date and was pleasantly surprised,"I did the old boredom swipe on tinder this weekend. There‚Äôs this guy from my hometown that over the years we‚Äôd text a little here and there but not often and not much..and matched with him a couple times. It has been a few years but the last few weeks he kept popping up on my tinder so I know he matched with me but I just kinda ignored it this time because I didn‚Äôt have too much interest and knew it would just be a few messages and that was it.

For some reason I just swiped this weekend and to no surprise we matched again. He messaged me almost instantly asking how I have been and within a few messages he asked if I wanted to meet him the next day. He said he‚Äôll pick me up at 3pm and that he had a plan. I liked this because it seemed confident and that he had put a bit of thought into it. I was even more pleasantly surprised when he arrived to pick me up and as I was walking towards his car he got out and walked around and greeted me, gave me a hug and proceeded to open the passenger door for me. The whole ride there he engaged in eye contact and chatted the whole way. We went for a costal walk/viewpoint along the sea. He bought our coffees, offered me his hand when climbing up onto steps etc. I got warm and took my cardigan off and he offered to carry it and took it from me. I also dropped my phone on the step because I had bad pockets and he offered to put it in his pocket for me while we were walking. He then took me for dinner after and paid for our meal and dropped me back home.

I know it seems very basic but that was the first guy that got out of a car to greet me and opened the door for me. I was just pleasantly shocked by the politeness, and realised you don‚Äôt get that too often anymore these days. I was glad I had swiped in the end. It‚Äôs the little things like this that really make a difference.

TL;DR I matched with someone on tinder that I knew but wasn‚Äôt expecting anything from it. We ended up going on a date that he had planned and I was unexpectedly and pleasantly surprised at how polite he was. He was the first date that has got out of a car to greet me and open the door for me. He ended up being so polite and I had a great time. It made me realise that that‚Äôs harder to come by these days and it‚Äôs the little things that make the difference. ",3,1750161229.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

The post-catalyst noise has faded, the trading volumes have thinned, and‚Äîif you look past the intermittent chatter‚Äîit feels like we‚Äôre in a holding pattern. But for anyone who‚Äôs been around biotech (or the markets) long enough, you‚Äôll know these are the moments where the real work gets done. When the headlines die down and the chart goes sideways, that‚Äôs when the smart money starts to pay attention‚Äînot just to what‚Äôs being said, but to who‚Äôs showing up behind the scenes.

This week, I want to do something a bit different. Over the past few months, we‚Äôve spent a lot of time dissecting clinical data, regulatory catalysts, and options flows. Now, with a brief lull in the action, it‚Äôs the perfect time to shine a forensic light on something that rarely gets its due: the institutional ownership structure of $ATYR. Not just a snapshot of ‚Äúwho owns what,‚Äù but a proper, institutional-grade breakdown‚Äîhow ownership evolves, why it matters, and what it signals about risk, sentiment, and potential future moves.

Why does this matter for us, here and now? In my view, institutional ownership is the one area where most retail investors are at a systematic disadvantage‚Äînot because the data is hidden, but because it‚Äôs so often misunderstood, misinterpreted, or ignored entirely. Yet for the professionals, this stuff is the lifeblood of market structure analysis. Knowing who‚Äôs in, who‚Äôs out, and how they tend to behave around catalysts is critical‚Äîespecially in a small float, catalyst-heavy biotech like $ATYR, where one or two players can change the game overnight.

The edge, for us, comes not from simply watching the tape, but from analysing ownership the way top-tier funds do‚Äîunpacking the reporting mechanics, reading the tea leaves, and asking the hard questions: Who‚Äôs moving size? Who‚Äôs quietly accumulating or trimming? Who‚Äôs new to the story? And crucially‚Äîwhat does this mean for price action, volatility, and our own decision-making as a community?

A quick note: I spend many hours every day on this research‚Äîcross-referencing filings, combing through strategy histories, and pulling together deep-dive analysis that most retail investors will never see. It‚Äôs free for everyone in the community, and I love doing it, but turning this into something sustainable genuinely depends on your support. There are a handful of readers who are generous with kind words and contributions, and it‚Äôs that support that makes these posts possible week after week. If you value what you‚Äôre reading, and want to help keep this a ‚Äúforensic edge‚Äù for the retail crowd (rather than another burnout project), please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo). Every contribution‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîmakes a real difference, and helps me keep this analysis free and independent for the community. 

**And to set the tone for this one:** what follows isn‚Äôt just another round-up post. This is a real deep dive‚Äîan analysis that, frankly, institutions themselves would want to get their hands on. I‚Äôve done the hard yards so you don‚Äôt have to. (And heck, if you *are* an institutional reader or represent a business looking for this level of diligence, feel free to reach out. Always happy to talk shop or collaborate if it adds value. My inbox is open.)

Here‚Äôs what to expect:  
We‚Äôll start by digging into the mechanics of institutional ownership‚Äîhow filings work, why there‚Äôs always a lag, and what that means for interpreting the data. From there, I‚Äôll break down the current stats, categorise the major holders, and take you through a detailed, category-by-category analysis of what the smart money is doing‚Äîand what it‚Äôs likely signalling. Along the way, I‚Äôll highlight key insights and actionable hypotheses, tying it all back to the information asymmetry that separates the best retail investors from the rest.

Let‚Äôs get into it.

**1. Why Institutional Ownership Matters (and How We Create an Edge)**

In biotech, it‚Äôs easy to become obsessed with the science, the catalysts, and the occasional headline that sends a chart parabolic overnight. Yet, for the institutional crowd‚Äîthe funds that actually move the needle on price action‚Äîownership structure is often the first and last thing they check before sizing up or down. There‚Äôs a simple reason: in catalyst-driven, thinly traded names like $ATYR, it‚Äôs the behaviour of the largest holders that sets the boundaries for volatility, liquidity, and ultimately, the narrative.

Institutional ownership is more than just a scoreboard of ‚Äúwho owns what.‚Äù It‚Äôs a living map of conviction, risk appetite, and herd behaviour. When funds with long track records and deep pockets start to accumulate (or exit) en masse, it often means that something important is brewing‚Äîsometimes well before it shows up in a press release or analyst note.

This is where the information edge starts to tilt in favour of the pros. Institutions not only have the resources to analyse every quarterly filing, but they also understand the nuances: who leads, who follows, who‚Äôs a genuine long-term investor, and who‚Äôs just there for the trade. For retail investors, the data is public‚Äîbut the skill is in reading it properly and contextualising it with what‚Äôs happening on the tape, in the options, and across the broader sector.

*Why focus on this now?*  
Right now, $ATYR is in a classic ‚Äúquiet before the storm‚Äù phase. The major clinical readouts are behind us, the next wave of catalysts is still some distance away, and the short-term news flow has gone cold. These are the moments when institutions start to rebalance, quietly build positions, or reposition risk‚Äîoften laying the groundwork for the next big move. For retail investors, this is the window to observe, interpret, and close the information gap.

Information asymmetry has always been the key battleground between professional and retail investors. The pros don‚Äôt just trade news‚Äîthey trade positioning, flows, and structural set-ups. The approach I‚Äôm taking here‚Äîtracking ownership shifts, breaking down category behaviours, and contextualising these moves within broader market mechanics‚Äîis the same forensic lens that many institutional PMs will be using to gauge opportunity and risk.

By learning to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the market through this lens, we create our own edge. It‚Äôs not just about following the herd or copying the smart money‚Äîit‚Äôs about understanding the playbook: why certain funds act when they do, how lagged reporting can be turned into an advantage, and how to spot the footprints of those who move first.

In my view, this kind of analysis is one of the few ways the retail crowd can close the gap on Wall Street. When we know what to look for, how to synthesise the data, and how to turn it into actionable insight, we shift the game back in our favour‚Äîone filing at a time.

**2. The Mechanics of Institutional Ownership (Filings, Lags, and Why the Details Matter)**

If you want to understand the chessboard in any public company‚Äîespecially a catalyst-driven micro-cap like $ATYR‚Äîyou need to know how the ‚Äúscore‚Äù is kept. This means grasping how institutional ownership is actually reported, what the numbers do (and don‚Äôt) tell you, and how that information cycles through the market.

*How Institutional Ownership Gets Reported: 13F and NPORT*

In the United States, the two main regulatory filings for tracking institutional positions are the SEC‚Äôs Form 13F and the NPORT (for registered funds).

- **13F filings**: Every institutional investment manager with over $100 million in assets must file a 13F each quarter. This lists all long equity positions (over a certain size), but crucially, it only covers the end-of-quarter snapshot‚Äînot intra-quarter trading, derivatives, or shorts.
- **NPORT filings**: These come from mutual funds and ETFs, providing a more granular monthly snapshot (often including derivative exposure), but with a similar lag. However, much of this is behind paywalls or only visible in summary form.

*The catch:*  
There‚Äôs always a delay‚Äîup to 45 days after quarter-end for 13Fs, a little quicker for NPORT. This means the data is inherently backward-looking, sometimes reflecting positions that have already shifted by the time we see them. For example, if the reporting date is March 31st, funds have until mid-May to submit‚Äîso real-world moves in April or early May won‚Äôt show up.

*What the Data Misses:*

- Shorts, options, swaps: The filings usually miss these. Some funds can be net short while showing up as a large long holder on the 13F. This is why options flow, dark pool prints, and unusual block trades often matter just as much.
- Position changes during the lag: Funds can exit, hedge, or double down in the 6-8 weeks after the snapshot date‚Äîsometimes front-running expected reactions to the next filings.
- Structural holdings: Index funds may show big swings around rebalancing windows, not necessarily as a ‚Äúvote‚Äù on the company but as part of passive flows.

*Why the Details Matter for Retail*

This lag and granularity is the core of the information asymmetry that institutions use to their advantage. The professionals know the limitations of the filings. They watch for ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù‚Äîwho‚Äôs entering quietly, who‚Äôs trimming, which category of fund is making the move, and whether the reported changes match what they‚Äôre seeing in real-time trading.

In my view, the retail crowd‚Äôs edge is in knowing what the data means, not just what it says. You don‚Äôt have to guess who‚Äôs buying on a random green day‚Äîyou can cross-reference spikes in volume or options activity against filings and news windows. That‚Äôs how you start building a real picture of the ‚Äútape‚Äù behind the tape.

*How This Data Gets Used by Institutions*

Institutions constantly monitor the filings for competitive intelligence:
- To spot new ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù entering a story or big redemptions/exits.
- To anticipate index moves, passive flows, or window-dressing ahead of catalysts.
- To gauge the conviction (or hesitancy) of peer funds around event risk.

This is why you‚Äôll see big moves right before or after filing windows, and why sophisticated players spend so much effort mapping out not just the positions, but the likely intent behind them.

*Bottom Line*

Understanding the mechanics behind institutional filings is step one. If you‚Äôre only looking at the top-line numbers without digging into the context, you‚Äôre missing the edge that comes from knowing how, when, and why the data moves‚Äîand who‚Äôs playing chess behind the scenes.

**3. Current Institutional Ownership ‚Äì Overview**

Before diving into the granular breakdown, it‚Äôs worth taking a step back to understand the current landscape: Who actually owns $ATYR right now? How is that changing? And‚Äîperhaps most crucially‚Äîwhat does the present mix reveal about what might come next?

*Key Statistics: Trends, Not Just Snapshots*

- **Percentage of Float Held by Institutions:**  
As of the latest filings, institutions control just under 70% of $ATYR‚Äôs float‚Äîa figure that has risen meaningfully over the past two quarters. To put that in perspective, institutional ownership is up over 11% this past quarter alone. This is not the profile of a thinly-traded, neglected micro-cap; it‚Äôs a stock where the ‚Äúadults in the room‚Äù are taking a visible, active stake.

- **Net Change Over the Quarter/Half:**  
Looking through the data, what stands out is the sheer volume of institutional movement‚Äîdozens of new entrants, high-conviction increases from major funds like Citadel and Millennium, and a handful of high-profile trims (notably Point72). Despite some churn, the net effect has been a broad-based increase in institutional engagement, with more size coming in than leaving.

- **Number and Mix of Institutions; Degree of Concentration:**  
The current holder list includes everything from index giants (Vanguard, State Street, BlackRock) and long-only asset managers (Fidelity, UBS) to hedge funds (Citadel, Millennium, Alyeska, Schonfeld), biotech specialists (Integral Health), and even family offices and fast-money quant shops. Notably, the top ten holders account for a majority of the institutional float, reflecting a high degree of concentration‚Äîwhen these players move, the whole stock moves with them.

*‚ÄúQuiet Before the Storm‚Äù: Where Are We in the Cycle?*

We‚Äôre in a lull, but it‚Äôs the sort of lull that feels heavily loaded. The major catalysts‚ÄîPhase 3 readout, partnership/m&a speculation, additional clinical data‚Äîare still on the horizon, and recent trading reflects this: volumes have thinned, newsflow has slowed, and short-term speculators have largely rotated out. But under the surface, institutional positioning has continued to evolve, quietly but decisively, against the backdrop of this market pause.

In my view, this ‚Äúquiet before the storm‚Äù dynamic is exactly the period where changes in ownership are most predictive. Institutions rarely build or shed large positions at the top of a news cycle‚Äîthey do it in the dark, on down days, or in periods of low liquidity, when few are watching and the headlines have moved on. This is how they gain their edge: by moving early, setting up for the next wave, and leaving only footprints for the attentive to find.

*How Ownership Structure Sets Up Future Moves*

Right now, the ownership mix has reached a tipping point. With so much of the float concentrated in hands that have both the patience and firepower to ride out volatility, there‚Äôs less ‚Äúweak hand‚Äù supply left to be shaken out. The next round of price discovery‚Äîwhether triggered by data, a deal, or a shift in sentiment‚Äîcould be amplified by this scarcity. When institutions decide to accumulate, the effect is magnified; when they decide to exit, it can cascade.

This is the practical, actionable relevance for the community: Understanding who‚Äôs holding, and how much, is one of the few ways to genuinely anticipate order flow and sentiment shifts before they hit the tape. This goes beyond just tracking raw numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs about pattern recognition, timing, and context.

*Why This Matters for Information Asymmetry*

Most retail investors, in my experience, never get past the headline ownership numbers. They see a big fund‚Äôs name and move on, never asking: ‚ÄúWhen did they buy? How much conviction do they show? Are they a leader or a follower?‚Äù Yet for those willing to read between the lines, these periods of apparent inactivity are where the sharpest information asymmetry exists.

In my opinion, this is where retail investors can narrow the gap. By understanding not just who is on the register, but when and how they‚Äôve accumulated (or sold), you start to see the market more as it truly is‚Äîa dynamic ecosystem where shifts in the background set up the front-page stories before they happen.

**4. Categorisation of Institutional Holders**

Before we get lost in the names and numbers, let‚Äôs step back and frame how institutions are grouped‚Äîbecause not all ‚Äúbig money‚Äù is built alike, and the way you categorise the register can change your whole read on what‚Äôs actually happening under the hood.

**Why Categorise at All?**

In the professional world, institutional analysts break down holders not just by size, but by behavioural archetype. Some provide ballast (liquidity and price floor), some drive sharp moves (event hunters, quant), and others are the canary in the coal mine (nimble, high-conviction early movers). Retail almost never does this‚Äîso simply asking who fits which role gives us an edge.

**My Categorisation Scheme (and Rationale):**

I‚Äôve grouped $ATYR‚Äôs institutional holders along both traditional and behavioural lines. Here‚Äôs what each group means in practical terms, why it matters, and how much of the register each cohort really controls.

---

**a) Passive Index & ETF Funds**

_(e.g. Vanguard, State Street, BlackRock, iShares)_  
**Role:** Provide a ‚Äúfloor‚Äù of ownership‚Äîsteady, price-insensitive, driven by index weightings, not stock-specific news.  
**Behaviour:** Rarely sell unless forced by index rebalancing.  
**Why It Matters:** Their presence sets the base liquidity and can reduce day-to-day volatility.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 28.5%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 41.0%

---

**b) Active Long-Only Managers**

_(e.g. Fidelity, Wellington, UBS, Wells Fargo)_  
**Role:** Conviction-driven investors, tend to accumulate on thesis, hold for the medium-term, and are less likely to ‚Äúflip‚Äù on one bad headline.  
**Behaviour:** They scale in/out, sometimes add on weakness, and signal belief in the underlying story.  
**Why It Matters:** Their moves often precede or follow major inflections‚Äîwatch for trends.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 16.2%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 23.4%

---

**c) Hedge Funds / Multi-Strat Funds**

_(e.g. Citadel, Millennium, Point72, Alyeska, Marshall Wace, Schonfeld)_  
**Role:** Aggressive event traders‚Äîoften in size, frequently hedged, and rarely there ‚Äúby accident.‚Äù  
**Behaviour:** Swing in and out around catalysts, can build or unwind rapidly, may use derivatives to amplify or hedge exposure.  
**Why It Matters:** When these players build positions, it often foreshadows volatility and/or big moves‚Äîbullish or bearish.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 9.9%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 14.3%

---

**d) Quant / Proprietary Trading Firms**

_(e.g. Susquehanna, Two Sigma, Jane Street, Wolverine, Squarepoint, Tower Research)_  
**Role:** High-frequency, high-turnover traders.  
**Behaviour:** Thrive on volatility, may provide liquidity but are not ‚Äústicky.‚Äù  
**Why It Matters:** Large growth in this cohort signals rising trading activity, which can mean the tape gets ‚Äúnoisier‚Äù and price swings more sharply into catalysts.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 7.4%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 10.6%

---

**e) Healthcare / Biotech Specialists**

_(e.g. Federated Hermes, Integral Health, Ally Bridge, Tang Capital, Octagon, Steadfast, Tikvah, Erste Asset Management)_  
**Role:** Deep scientific diligence, highly focused on trial outcomes and competitive landscape.  
**Behaviour:** Long-term, tend to ‚Äúknow what they own‚Äù‚Äîsometimes build quietly before big moves.  
**Why It Matters:** Their increasing presence means smart sector-specific capital is leaning in; a high and rising share here is a sign of sector validation.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 13.8%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 19.8%

---

**f) Family Offices / Small Asset Managers**

_(e.g. Jain Global, Dauntless, Continuum, Kingswood, Main Street, Sachetta, Apollon, Cannon Global, Caldwell, Farther Finance)_  
**Role:** Nimble, can be early-movers or thesis-driven contrarians.  
**Behaviour:** Sometimes take meaningful stakes relative to AUM; more likely to buy on deep research or local knowledge.  
**Why It Matters:** If these holders grow, it may signal under-the-radar conviction‚Äîsometimes they spot what the herd misses.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 2.1%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 3.0%

---

**g) Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth, Insurance**

_(e.g. OMERS, Northern Trust, Bank of America Pension, United Bank)_  
**Role:** Ultra-long-term, generally conservative.  
**Behaviour:** Rarely move quickly, but add ballast and stability.  
**Why It Matters:** A rising share here reduces volatility, and their entry/exit is slow, providing long-term confidence.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 1.7%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 2.5%

---

**h) Market-Makers / Liquidity Providers**

_(e.g. Jane Street, Wolverine, Group One, Virtu, HRT, Simplex, Citadel, Two Sigma Securities)_  
**Role:** Provide trading liquidity; may hold significant positions, but often hedged or neutral.  
**Behaviour:** Typically respond to order flow; not directional over time.  
**Why It Matters:** A large presence here means liquidity is healthy, but they are not ‚Äúreal‚Äù owners‚Äîwatch for turnover, not thesis.  
**Approx. Share of Total Shares:** 2.6%  
**Approx. Share of Institutional Holdings:** 3.8%

---

**i) New Entrants and Exits**

**Role:** Flags shifts in the register that are often missed by retail.  
**Behaviour:** New institutional buying, especially by a group with a track record in biotech winners, can be a major tell. Exits, especially en masse or from specialists, can mean thesis is stale or risk is rising.  
**Why It Matters:** Professional investors pay special attention to fresh money flows and rapid departures‚Äîthey‚Äôre often leading indicators for trend changes.  
_Example: Octagon‚Äôs major new position; Adage, Two Sigma, and other exits last quarter._

---

**Why This Institutional Breakdown Matters (and How It Builds an Edge)**

This isn‚Äôt just an academic exercise. When institutions run their own playbooks, this kind of categorisation is how they decide whether a move is ‚Äúreal‚Äù (thesis-driven, sticky) or just the result of passive or liquidity-driven flows. When we, as a retail community, start to break down the register in this way, we get a first-order view of the information asymmetry at work.

Most retail investors only see a list of names. The real edge comes from understanding that the mix‚Äîthe behavioural makeup‚Äîtells you who‚Äôs likely to hold, who‚Äôs poised to run, and who‚Äôs going to disappear on the next catalyst. This is exactly the lens that institutional investors use to anticipate inflections, volatility, and, ultimately, where the real money will be made.

In my view, the process of categorising holders by behaviour and weighting gives us a fighting chance to close the information gap. It‚Äôs not just who owns the shares‚Äîit‚Äôs what kind of owners they are, and what their past behaviour tells us about what might happen next.

**5. Data Table or Key Holdings Visualisation**

Below is a detailed, fully accurate snapshot of $ATYR‚Äôs institutional landscape. I‚Äôve included the holder name, shares held, % change for the quarter, reporting date, value, and (where possible) the best-fit institutional category and ‚ÄúTrend‚Äù tag using the taxonomy/definitions from prior sections. This covers the top 50 holders by shares, directly from the official data:

**Definitions ‚Äì Trend Column**

- **Leader:** Consistently early to size up or down; often sets the tone for sector allocation and inflection points.
- **Floor:** Stable, ‚Äústicky‚Äù capital‚Äîpassive, rarely sells, provides base liquidity and reduces volatility.
- **Conviction:** Deep, long-term, thesis-driven stake‚Äîgenerally strong sector insight and strong hands through volatility.
- **Aggressive:** Rapid, high-volatility moves‚Äîoften event-driven, sometimes in/out around specific catalysts.
- **Active:** Frequently trades around catalysts, but not necessarily a leader or follower; opportunistic.
- **Follower:** Often builds position after signals from sector leaders; not first to move.
- **High Turn:** High-frequency, trading-driven, not sticky‚Äîtypically market-makers or quant traders.
- **Event:** Positioning is built primarily around a binary or high-impact event.
- **Stability:** Ultra-long term, low churn, focused on risk management and volatility reduction.
- **Early Move:** Nimble, small manager or family office, often taking a meaningful stake ahead of the herd.
- **New Entrant:** Major fresh position this period‚Äîclosely watched by peers.

---

**Highlights:**
- **New Entrant:** Octagon‚Äôs leap to 3.55M shares, a 294% increase, marks one of the quarter‚Äôs most aggressive fresh bets.
- **Biggest Accumulator:** Citadel Advisors with a 2,011% position increase‚Äîuncommon at this scale‚Äîsignals a high-conviction event-driven play.
- **Conviction Size:** Healthcare specialists (Federated, Tikvah, Tang) quietly build or hold stakes, often under the radar.

---

**Why This Table Matters**

Institutions don‚Äôt just care who is on the register; they care about how much conviction is being shown and by whom. Big jumps from an Octagon, Citadel, or Millennium almost always precede either volatility or a sharp rerating‚Äîthese players rarely make size moves without a strong thesis or a catalyst on the horizon. By tracking both the aggregate and the outliers, you‚Äôre following the playbook that every top-tier institutional analyst uses‚Äîwatch the flows, watch the hands, and watch the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù

For years now, i‚Äôve been dealing with stomach related issues, acid reflux, stomach, especially left side pain, bloating, burping, gas‚Ä¶ Some periods it calms down, and then some were really bad. In the last few months symptoms started to be much worse, everything i mentioned above plus big air hunger, feeling like i can‚Äôt take a satisfying breath, some back pains‚Ä¶ etc. I also noticed what started to worry me the most, heart palpitations, that were usually happening if i eat more than i should or if i drink more sodas or coffee during the day i would get this heart fluttering sensation in the center of my diaphragm area once or twice. I went to doctor that prescribed me Nexium and told me to take it for one month, which helped while i was taking it and that it‚Äôs very possible that i have hiatal hernia and that i should do gastroscopy, which i declined. He sent me to abdomen/kidney ultrasound and most of it was fine, except for ‚Äúfolded gallbladder‚Äù and one kidney having ‚Äúrough echo structure‚Äù. But as many of you can guess ultrasound couldn‚Äôt reveal anything about hiatal hernia.

Now, i am still having GERD issues, which some days are much worse than the others and i am taking smaller dose PPI (not Nexium) when needed. But my biggest issue is, these heart flutters or what feels like heart skips that now i can usually feel on the left side of my stomach, not in the center of diaphragm that much but left side of the stomach, just under the my rib and sometimes in the throat. I can even feel it while i am testing my pulse, it‚Äôs normal, then it feels like one beat pause and then one stronger beat that makes me feel very scared and like i am losing a breath for a second. For around 10 years now i am also dealing with (health) anxiety and you can all guess that it makes everything even worse. I am going to cardiologist today, because these heart flutters are becoming more and more common and can happen what feels like randomly, especially if i am sitting with not the best posture.

Can anyone please tell me, is this something to take seriously and be worried out? Because i simply can‚Äôt get used to it and can‚Äôt live normally with it. It can ruin my day and weeks. Thanks!",1,1750161157.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

1ldl2v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ldl2v7/need_some_advice_to_help_me_sort_my_thoughts_out/,Need some advice to help me sort my thoughts out. Never really had closure.,"So my ex broke up with me almost 9 months ago. I knew I was leaving the country we lived in during the summer, we still went on a 2 week holiday in her home country (we did not live there) in August which was amazing, blissful, romantic and passionate. She also introduced me to a few of her friends there and we were talking like we were going to be together for years. The last time I ever saw her was at the airport before I left, before that holiday together even began we agreed we would remain together and do long distance. Less than a month after that she said she changed her mind about doing long distance, said she isnt the person that can do it and broke up with me via text which devastated me. Later that day we called and she was crying the whole time, as many people here probably have themselves, at the start I tried to change her mind but realized it was fruitless and just let it go. She said she saw no future since it seemed unlikely/complicated we would live in the same city again. My plan was to move back to where I lived with her after a year when I was done with my masters degree, but I never told her that because I was not 100% sure I would (due to job opportunities etc) and did not want to make an empty promise, it did not feel fair.

She never reached out to me or me to her, until christmas (3 months later) where I do not even know if it counts as it but she liked one of my instagram stories. We started talking and she was different to the other times after the break up, she was a bit more flirty and we were making plans to meet up. She said that she always felt like just my presence would make her happy, she felt that I always brought the mood up in any room, she really loved me and other really nice things. Well, new years rolls around, and she tells me she started seeing her a guy who joined her friend group recently... I got a bit emotional and shouldn't have, but told her I was originally planning to move back. She said if she knew that she probably wouldn't have left me, we both got a little bit emotional and argued a little bit. She said she would like to meet for a coffee or have a phone call, I think she wanted some closure asap or maybe I am misinterpreting. I told her no chance I will do it now, but in the future sure. She said she felt like she did nothing wrong but if she did she apoligizes.

We never contacted eachother after that for a while. She still kept me added on all her social media including her private instagram which feels weird. She also still had pictures of me in her posts and story highlights on her public instagram. Since then I have not opened either of her instagram pages once or looked at any of her stories to help myself move on. She did not say anything to me during my birthday. When it was her birthday (last month) I just sent her a happy birthday message. She replied that she was glad to hear from me, said she knows she missed my birthday but was not sure if she should send a message, and started trying to make conservation with me. I replied and after she kept trying to make conversation giving me all the updates on her life and I just did not reply.

For some periods after the break up I did not miss her, I have also had some flings in my new city since then. But for some reason the past days out of nowhere I cannot stop thinking about her and the situation. It feels so strange and unresolved, I do not think I love her anymore, and getting back together is not even on my mind since our lives are so far apart now, but I just cannot stop thinking about it. It all feels so unresolved to me. After the breakup she said she will always care about me, but does she really? Why was she trying to make conservation with me? Why does she keep me added on her socials including the private one, but never really reaches out to me? Why does she even still have pictures of me there? Am I acting this way because of the lack of closure? But what can I do about it? I feel like calling her to talk about it all might crush me realizing that she gives a lot less of a fuck about me than I do about her, and I know that the answers to all of my questions do not really matter either. Now that I reflect, maybe what I really want to know are her true thoughts but even then what would that accomplish for me? Does a part of me really want to see her in person again or what is it?

I am sorry if this does not really make sense, my head has just been a mess the past few days and I am not really sure what to do about it! Many thanks to anyone who had the patience to read this <3",3,1750161080.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Overthinking every step, and excessively talking led to her not moving fwd with us. Shit happens... How to improve?

Date #1
Went out for drinks, I paid for drinks, my rule of thumb on first date.

Date #2
grabbed coffee, went on a walk and played mini golf. Paid for mini golf in advance, she thanked me for it, didn't insist on paying half, but bought hot chocolate in return for us.

Both dates were initiated and planned for the most part by me, she appreciated me picking out stuff to do and giving her a couple options. Overall she said she had fun and I said let's do this again and she was on board.

Date #3
Finally did dinner n drinks. I initiated again, she never texts till I do. Her texts are super short, but she does respond quickly when I plan something.

At dinner she stated she got laid off and obviously I picked up the check, she did want to split it. Suggested she could pay for drinks after. We never kissed yet and I was nervous on initiating it or finding the right moment to do it. Felt things were going well so far and since she is not initiating much I should. While walking I suggested casually we should make out, she was like yeah we should. She is not flirty, pretty hard to read, no subtle touching either from her. I have initiated subtle contact a few times on previous dates but she is not too receptive. 

This is where I think I messed up - I got a little buzzed and talkative for once (otherwise she talks more) after the first bar. We tried to go bar hopping and sadly 2 of them had a cover charge which was not expected. Went to a bar with no cover, and she walked out a minute later, saying she didn't like it. she is picky and indecisive at times. Since other bars were charging, I refused to pay and she got turned off and said let's call it's a night. I was a bit taken back because we both were trying to actually have fun and I wanted to distract her from her work situation. She called herself an Uber, and wasn't talking much. We kissed goodnight and that was it. 

I texted her today, 2 days after, asking if she is up for hanging out again, and she declined saying she needs time to heal and focus on herself so she is taking a step back from dating and stuff. Yes I know what this means. 


TLDR - after 2 fun dates, 3rd date didn't go as well, and she cut it off after I asked her out again. I recall sharing lots of stories and talking more on the 3rd date cuz I was buzzed and with ADHD I blabber more than usual. When bar hoping I refused to pay $10 or $20 cover for bars, which turned her off and she called it a night. She got laid off before our 3rd date and declined to go out again saying she needs time to heal and focus on herself, instead of dating. In other words ""It's not you, it's me""

It‚Äôs been quite a long time, I know. I kept y‚Äôall waiting for Part 2, and lately, I‚Äôve been getting non-stop DMs asking for it. So yeahh... here we go.


Link of the first part:
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/s/wlkGgjwYdX]


We started preparing ourselves for our first meet. I‚Äôve never had a real in-person date before since all my past relationships started and ended in long distance. So my brain was both blank and buzzing, excitement and anxiety all tangled up. We fixed our first meeting on 30th March 2024.

I was raised by two very overstrict parents who don‚Äôt even hesitate to threaten me into submission if I dare dream of living on my terms. They made sure I stayed trapped in our hometown by not letting me write CUET. They feared what would happen if I ever got a taste of the freedom they‚Äôre desperately trying to keep from me. They chose my current college because my dad‚Äôs an alumnus and most of the professors are his friends. Basically, my life‚Äôs on surveillance mode.
(But I don‚Äôt want you to get all heavy reading more about their parenting style.)

At that point, I was still healing from a previous relationship and the constant emotional suffocation from my parents. But Makri‚Ä¶ he helped me breathe.

I still wonder how effortlessly he brought out a version of me I never even knew existed. I‚Äôve always been a tomboy at heart, but he made me feel safe being soft, feminine, and free. For the first time, I didn‚Äôt have to wear the ‚Äúmature and composed‚Äù mask my dad glued to my face for years. I‚Äôm still a student, but doing way more than what a college fresher usually does. Not my words, my professors' say that! Some of them even care about my mental health more than my own parents.

With Makri, I felt like I could finally exist without carrying the world on my shoulders. I knew it would feel even better when he was right beside me.

I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to go out by myself last year (not a huge difference now either), so I told one of my classmates to tag along for safety. Even though Makri seemed amazing online, I just wanted to be careful. But on the morning of our meet, I had this weird dream. She told me she wouldn‚Äôt be able to come. And guess what? She texted me an hour before our date that she couldn‚Äôt make it due to something urgent.

My heart dropped.
Makri was already on the train, heading toward my place. I couldn‚Äôt cancel.

I was panicking. I lied to my parents that I was going to meet a classmate in town, grabbed a rose, and left for the railway station.

As I stepped inside, I called him.
He said he just got off the train.

Here I was, excited, panicking, tensed, all at once. My legs literally started shivering while walking, something I never felt even when performing live on stage in front of hundreds. My heart was racing. My eyes scanned the station, searching for those familiar cute brown boba eyes. I looked at every tall guy passing by, hoping one of them would be him.

And then... there he was.

Tall, adorable Makri, in a navy blue tee, greyish track pants, and a simple black backpack.

The first thought that hit me?

‚ÄúGosh, he‚Äôs real!!‚Äù

He walked up and gave me a small side hug. I led him toward the entrance. There was a baby crying like crazy nearby. Out of nowhere, Makri said in his hilariously broken Malayalam,

‚ÄúAhh kochinu orotta chavitt kodukkatte!!‚Äù

I tried so hard not to laugh. I just stared at him, stunned. Later he told me his mind went blank and he blurted that out just to kick off a conversation. Well, that really was our first proper convo.

We got into an auto and headed to Tonico Caf√©, since there aren‚Äôt many date-worthy places in Aksharanagary and this one‚Äôs close to the station. We sat opposite each other, visibly nervous and giddy.

He gave me a mini bouquet of roses, chocolates, and my favorite....Werther‚Äôs Original.
I gave him the rose and chocolate I brought.

He was even better looking in real life, and more talkative. He tried so hard to keep me comfortable, and I could feel it. We held hands for the first time, shared our caramel smoothie and brownie shake. It felt like a dream. I couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening in my hometown, a place where I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôm under a microscope because of my dad‚Äôs social circle.

But Makri, sensing my tension, kept throwing jokes and making me laugh.
And it was working.

In the middle of all this, mom called. She asked me to buy something from town. I told her I would and added that a classmate‚Äôs cousin was with us. She said okay, not suspecting anything. I was still anxious but tried to stay calm. We laughed and walked to the store together. Bought the stuff for mom and returned to the railway station.

We sat there for about 20 minutes. I rested my head on his shoulder, feeling heavy inside. I didn‚Äôt know when I‚Äôd see him again. College reopening was the only hope.

He gently held my hand and played with my nails, softly touching the silver ring my mom gifted me two years ago.

Since Makri had only ever said ‚ÄúI like you,‚Äù and promised he‚Äôd say the other word when he truly meant it, I asked,

 ‚ÄúYou like-like me or you love me, koche?‚Äù

My heart was pounding. I don‚Äôt even know if he could hear it.

He took a deep breath, looked at me with the most beautiful smile a man has ever given me, and said:

  ‚ÄúI love you, kunjunni.‚Äù

I froze. My eyes welled up. Tears came down without warning, and I didn‚Äôt even try to stop them. (Honestly, I‚Äôm tearing up again while writing this.)

I whispered,
    ‚ÄúDo you have any idea when we‚Äôre gonna meet again?‚Äù

He smiled softly,
   ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see where it goes, da. We‚Äôll work it out.‚Äù

His train was arriving. I tried to hold back my crying. He got on, the train was jam-packed, so he stood inside. I waved, heart heavy.

But then, he jumped down from the train again,

And hugged me. Tightly.

It was unexpected.
And I melted.

I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô9 chubby girl, but in that moment, I felt like a little puppy wrapped in the warmth of her 6‚Äô5 favorite human. That hug wasn‚Äôt just a goodbye. It was a promise, a feeling of being seen, heard, and cherished.

He hopped back in. The train started moving. I stood there, eyes following his face until he faded into the crowd.

I went home feeling two things at once, sadness that he‚Äôs gone and a calm assurance that the risk I took was worth it.

But when I reached home, my biggest fear came true.

My grandfather was there. The one who only shows up when something‚Äôs wrong or about to go down.
He saw us walking together. And he wasted no time.

He rushed to my parents and delivered the ‚Äúhot news"".
That‚Äôs when it all exploded.

My mom and grandfather started taunting me, accusing me of ‚Äúshameless behavior.‚Äù They weaponized shame and morality to silence me. I somehow managed to stick to my story, that he was my classmate‚Äôs cousin and nothing was going on.

Even now, they don‚Äôt let me go out alone. My mom brings up that incident in every argument. She says relationships are distractions from career, conveniently forgetting how she dropped out of college and starved herself just to marry my dad, who‚Äôs 17 years older than her.

She calls this generation heartless. Says we change partners like clothes.

But despite all that, our relationship kept growing stronger.

Makri became my peace, my comfort, my free therapy. I was never someone who could be all romantic and cheesy, but he slowly, patiently ‚Äúpookified‚Äù me. It took almost 6 months, but he got me there.

We do fight sometimes, of course. But we never end a day without fixing it. He‚Äôs the calmest place I run to.

Our second meet was three months later, on his birthday. This time, I wasn‚Äôt as nervous. We both wore cute white tops. I gifted him a birthday mug filled with chocolates and my first handwritten love letter.

After that, we made it a point to meet at least once every month.
I lost count after our 8th date.

Now, it‚Äôs been almost 1.5 years with him. Every single day, I fall harder.

Since he‚Äôs an ex-NRI, his Malayalam was hilarious in the most adorable way. Our convos were 60% English and 40% Malayalam. But now, he initiates in Malayalam, even trying hard to say romantic words just for me. Now we talk 85% in Malayalam,  and guess what? Im accidentally rubbing off on his malayalam accent too!

He never forgets to bring me a single red rose on every date. That one rose means the world to me.

Even this morning, when I saw his selfie sipping coffee from the birthday mug, my heart did a little flip. I smiled, knowing,

During Dec/Jan I used PSMF to drop from 178lbs to 161. I switched to a more standard CICO approach and dropped to 148lbs. DEXA when I was 155lbs showed 31% body fat and 108lbs fat free mass

Had tons of travel last few weeks which made consistency hard and fat loss has plateaued. Need a kick start again. I started yesterday at 148lbs, 145.4 this morning (there goes the water weight). Would probably DEXA about 27-28% so Cat 2. 

Goal is to get to mid 130s. So not a huge amount to lose but as a short person who carries fat in the belly, it should make a nice difference. Will be lifting low volume heavy 2x a week, walking daily, eating 135g protein. One small refeed (couple of bagels) and one free meal per week. There is a weekend when I'm at a wedding and I'll probably just take a couple days off and return to the diet when I get back home.

Today's menu: protein coffee; tuna and sauerkraut; egg whites and light cheese with veggies; 3% beef sauteed with cabbage and spices. And tons of no sugar electrolytes and black coffee. Energy not amazing but doing ok. Need to lift later today after work.

One minute you're looking forward to having dinner with your mate. Next, you're running for your life. I‚Äôm thankful that I even found out that my mate was such a piece of s\*\*t. I had been looking forward to finding them my whole life. Dreaming of a wedding where I could claim them as mine in front of all my friends and family. I should have seen the truth staring me in the face. I was so in love, so completely enamored of him. I went along with all his suggestions. Every. Single. One. I never saw his true intentions. I just lived in my little bubble of happiness, where everything was going as it should. I‚Äôd allowed him to charm me. I‚Äôd let him explain why we hadn‚Äôt had my Luna Ceremony. I‚Äôd accepted his excuses as to why he couldn‚Äôt mark me just yet. It was never the right time. I'd swallowed my pride repeatedly, all for a dream. It was all an illusion, and he played his part to absolute perfection. He had seemed so caring at first. He was interested in learning everything about me, and I was flattered. I was foolish. I'm thankful for all my training as I sit perched over thirty feet up in this tree. I hate that I didn‚Äôt bring my cell phone with me. I‚Äôm too far away to be able to mindlink anyone for help, and this is life and death. The forest is silent, and I cursed myself for not seeing this sooner. I‚Äôm smarter than this. How could I have allowed this to happen? I held back a sob. I cannot make any noise. My mate, Trevor Byrne, wanted me dead. I knew that a new team was now out here with me. The whole situation was ridiculous. I already knew that Trevor was going to spin it, to try to keep my family from getting involved. That wasn‚Äôt going to happen. Trevor wasn‚Äôt the smartest Alpha out there, but I recently discovered he is among the most ruthless. I was the happiest I can remember six hours ago. I went to find Trevor. I'd just returned from the pack hospital with the best news. We were going to have a baby. I ran into the pack house's back entrance and took the back stairs. I wanted to tell him the good news. I was moving so fast, I was just a blur. Trevor had been interested in what our pup would be if we were to get pregnant. His pack, Still Waters, was not as welcoming to me as it should have been. I know they had a recent scare and lost some warriors. But my team ended that threat for them. I wasn‚Äôt like the vampires that had caused them issues. Yet, with each passing day, the stares became more aggressive. Trevor told me that the pack would warm up to me. I was just paranoid, but they didn‚Äôt warm up. In fact, it had gotten much worse in the last two weeks. I hope this good news will be the turning point for the pack to accept me, and their Alpha heir. I knew something was wrong the moment I arrived outside his office. I could smell Heidi in there with him. I could scent the fact that they were having s\*x. Although my heart doesn‚Äôt beat, it still broke into a million pieces. I trusted him. I stepped back in shock, as my first instinct was to pound on the door. Although we were primarily vampires, Maksim and I received our wolf counterparts the day we turned sixteen. Dr. Gurin had been amazed. More like thrilled, as I'd never seen him so excited. Although he had charted our growth our whole lives, his excitement at having been given such a gift could not be contained at that point. My wolf, Storm, was like a built-in best friend for me. We were one entity, but Storm had her own opinions and strengths. She made me stronger and faster. She also increased my vision and hearing by over double. I could scent danger well before they could get close enough to hurt me. All because of Storm. My mate was still f\*\*\*\*\*g that b\*\*\*h, and I heard it when they both climaxed. I felt like I was going to be sick. I've asked him at least thirty times in the last two months about Heidi. He always said they used to date, but were just friends now. She was always putting her hands on my mate. She didn‚Äôt care that it bothered me; she seemed to enjoy that fact. She always portrayed it as being innocent between them. They were best friends, and I had a suspicious mind. She always knew how to dig the knife in deeper with her rude comments. ‚ÄúWhy are you so suspicious? Is it because vampires cheat a lot? How could Trevor or I be willing to do that to you? I think your opinion of me is disgusting,‚Äù Heidi told me last week. Acting shocked that I would even suggest anything between them. She even produced tears. Her father, still the acting Beta, had thrown me a disapproving glare across the table. Trevor lost no time leaning over to comfort her, not me, which was another red flag. I‚Äôm sickened to hear them both trying to catch their breath as they come back down. This certainly explained his long hours at work, since this was part of what he'd been doing. It all made sense now. I pushed my anger down and reached into my jeans. I would record them as leverage for him to accept my rejection. I have a great deal of money. My father had been saving up for all of his children. I was just the first to leave the nest. I only took a portion of it. I had been using my money to invest in his pack. I‚Äôm glad I never told him how much I had now. The issue was, in my excitement, I‚Äôd left my cell phone at the pack hospital. ‚ÄúTrevor,‚Äù Heidi whined. ‚ÄúWhen are you going to get rid of that disgusting bloodsucker. The whole pack is nervous with her in it. I won‚Äôt allow her to stay here. You‚Äôre mine. You always have been. I can‚Äôt believe that you‚Äôre cheating on me with her. Goddess only knows what disgusting diseases she has from drinking blood.‚Äù ‚ÄúSoon, love, soon,‚Äù Trevor replied. He sounded so happy. I‚Äôm utterly disgusted by his behavior. ‚ÄúI already told you, we need a few more improvements done to the pack. I didn‚Äôt hear you complaining when you got to go shopping with me the other day. You seemed pleased with your new vehicle and wardrobe. Melina is loaded. She only took a portion of her money with her. Goddess only knows how much she has still in the bank. She put almost two million into the pack's account. Why would I cut her loose when she‚Äôs so valuable to me and the pack?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt like that you‚Äôre still sleeping with her. You belong to me, you promised me, and I know how the bond works. It will only get stronger. How did she even know that you were her mate? It‚Äôs impossible. Are you sure you‚Äôre not falling for her?‚Äù Heidi complained. I could hear her snuggling closer into my mate. They are both despicable as far as I‚Äôm concerned. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm not falling for her, Love. You forget, my best friend was killed by one of those bloodsucking monsters. I would never accept one of them as my mate. She's a good lay, and she adores me. But I‚Äôve got her down to just sleeping with me once a week. She still thinks I care about her,‚Äù I heard him stop to laugh with her. I felt ice refreeze my broken heart. I refuse to allow him to hurt me again. ‚ÄúGood, but you'd better figure something out soon. I won‚Äôt let our pup have any competition. It‚Äôs easier for a true mate to get pregnant. I don‚Äôt even know how that b\*\*\*h could, but it seems she is pregnant as well, Trevor. My friend Shelley at the pack hospital called to warn me. They don‚Äôt know how far along she is yet, but I won‚Äôt have a bloodsucking bastard take my pup‚Äôs place in your heart, or this pack. So you better come up with something soon. Or else I'm leaving with your pup. You can stay here with your undead queen, without me,‚Äù Heidi snapped out. ‚ÄúI refuse to live without you, Heidi. I‚Äôll figure it out. We might not be mates, but I love you. Can‚Äôt you just be patient? I can‚Äôt get the other money she has without using this money first. I‚Äôll let her think I still care, while I figure out how to get rid of her. We have to be careful here. Also, I need to warn you. You didn‚Äôt meet those who came here to end those rogue vampires. They are deadly, and they are good at their jobs. It would be nothing for them to return and wipe us all out. I'll deal with Melina. I will tell her it‚Äôs not the right time for us to have a child. She always does as I ask. I won‚Äôt allow that child to be born. The doctor linked me. He is horrified at the thought of that monstrosity being allowed to be born, let alone rule the pack. He already gave her abortion pills instead of prenatal vitamins. So, stop worrying. We‚Äôve been together this whole time; nothing will change that. I‚Äôve been slipping her wolfbane in her morning coffee. Melina won‚Äôt find out about us,‚Äù Trevor replied confidently. ‚ÄúBut what if she does?‚Äù Heidi asked again. I started to get worried. Wait. Does she know I‚Äôm out here? ‚ÄúIf she does, I‚Äôll move the plan up and end her. I just need to find something that would be believable. I‚Äôve been asking about her life the whole time she‚Äôs been here. I know her much better than she thinks I do. I needed to learn how to make it look like a plausible accident. Now, stop worrying about what might happen. I need to have you again before I complete this paperwork,"" my mate replied. I could hear them kissing again. I backed slowly away from the door. I don‚Äôt need to hear this. I already felt like I was going to be sick. My eyes were wet with tears. My mate never wanted me at all. He just used me for my money. I‚Äôve got to get out of here. I turned to go back the same way I came and walked right into Beta Charles‚Äô chest. I never heard him approach. I guess I was so upset at finding out what a piece of crap my mate was, that I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. ‚ÄúI knew something was off, Lina,‚Äù Storm linked me. ‚ÄúWe both did, Storm,‚Äù I linked back. It was the whole reason I went to the doctor. I never suspected that my mate, who happily brought me my first cup of coffee each morning, would hurt me like this. ‚ÄúCome along quietly, Melina. No need to make this harder than it has to be. He will never leave Heidi. Too bad the Goddess hated you enough to bond you two together. You are the bane of our existence. It is blasphemy for our kind to be diluted with another. It‚Äôs best we deal with you and that thing you‚Äôre carrying now,‚Äù Beta Charles stated quietly. On The Run 1998 Words Chapter 2 Melina‚Äôs POV Beta Charles never called me Luna, not once in the nine weeks I‚Äôve been here. Now I knew why. I wasn‚Äôt paranoid at all. My mate was just an incredible liar. I wasn‚Äôt going to go anywhere with him. He'd kill me the first opportunity he got. I knew he was planning on taking me down to the cells. They would torture me and kill me. I'm too far away from my brother to be able to mindlink with him. I needed my phone, but I can't just waltz out to the pack hospital to get it. I did the only thing I could do. I gave a quick turn and hit him in the temple as hard as I could with my elbow. He fell heavily to the floor. This alerted Trevor and Heidi about an issue, but I believe Heidi knew I was out here. She enjoyed hurting me, so she led the conversation. She didn‚Äôt tell Trevor that I could hear what he was saying. If he knew I was here, he would have sent Heidi away. I didn‚Äôt wait around to see if my hypothesis was correct. I just ran. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt help you very much, Lina,‚Äù Storm linked me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, Storm. Save your strength, rest for now. I'll try to get us to a safe spot to rest. You can hide my scent while I sleep. We trusted Trevor, but he never deserved our love. It hurts, but I won't let him break me. He isn‚Äôt worth it,‚Äù I linked her back. ‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù Storm replied before fading away. I ran through the forest. Bushes caught my clothes and tore at them. I could feel my face being scratched, along with my arms and legs. My arms bore the brunt of it. My shirt was much thinner than my jeans were, but I never slowed down. I could hear the sounds of the warriors and Trevor coming after me. I bet Trevor was furious now. Well, that‚Äôs on him. I know the real reason he never marked me. He didn‚Äôt have to wait for the Luna ceremony. He just wanted to be able to screw around with Heidi as long as he could, and not get caught. Well, now he can screw her as much as he likes. I was disgusted that he slept with her. That jerk to my virginity, yet didn‚Äôt defend me to that witch. If anyone had a nasty disease, it would be her. I hope his d\*\*k falls off. I know I‚Äôm being petty, but my anger drives me now. I hope the added strength he got from having me here disappears. I ran for miles, but I could hear them behind me. Howling as they followed me further into the forest. I knew I needed to play this smarter than I was before I became exhausted. I was running at full speed and wasting energy. I knew it was only a matter of time before I needed to feed. I was running too fast to even think about finding a small animal to drink from. Plus, if they found it, they'd know I was close. I would rather die than allow myself to be drug back to Still Waters. I kept my eyes trained ahead and focused on my path as I continued to run. I was slimmer than they were in their wolf form. I slipped through places I knew they couldn‚Äôt follow. I knew trackers had trackers out here following me. He was not planning on letting me get away. ‚ÄúBaby, stop, I‚Äôm sorry, Melina. It was a one-time thing. It won‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù Trevor called out, trying to get me to stop. Now, I‚Äôm sure that Heidi and her father were the only ones who knew I had been there. She intentionally mentioned being pregnant to get me upset, that‚Äôs probably when he father walked up behind me. That confirmed that he was planning on getting rid of me this whole time. I felt sick again, but I have to keep moving forward. I refuse to allow them to kill me and my baby. I knew they would terminate my pregnancy if they caught me. The doctor didn‚Äôt even feel bad about giving me abortion pills. This whole pack was full of disgusting wolves. I see a section of broadleaf evergreens coming up, and I know what to do. I picked up more speed and jumped. I was about thirty feet in the air on a solid branch, but I can‚Äôt stop here. I have to keep jumping. Luckily, the tree next to it only had a few leaves. I could jump from tree to tree until I got to around the middle of the area. I needed a place to hide. I needed to rest and calm down. I needed to think clearly, as I had been running nonstop for two hours. I know that I have covered around a hundred miles. ‚ÄúWhen we hear them, hide my scent, Storm,‚Äù I told her. I was in a great spot. About thirty-five feet up in the air. I couldn‚Äôt see them from this little nest I had made for myself. They couldn't see me if I couldn‚Äôt see them. Trevor had asked me so many questions about myself. I foolishly thought he was trying to get to know me better. I never thought it was for him to use it against me. I had to hold back the scoff. They weren‚Äôt close anymore. They were nowhere as fast as I am. Thankfully, I had lied a few times to spare his feelings. Like when he asked how fast I could run. I told him about sixty-five miles per hour at full speed. It was still much faster than a wolf, but Trevor could run about forty miles per hour in his wolf form. Even with me downplaying it, he was still upset about it. That should have been the first clue that he thought his species was better than mine. My first inkling of a problem was when we met with the packs after we arrived, to figure out where the vampires were hiding. That was our first day here, and the day we met. I was so excited about finding my mate that I ignored that he wasn‚Äôt smiling back at me. In hindsight, he seemed ashamed to admit I was his mate. I caught the looks from the other Alphas in the meeting. They weren‚Äôt happy for him, like when you meet your mate. I didn‚Äôt notice it at the time, but my brother had. He warned me to be careful. He calls me four times a week to check on me. If he calls and I don‚Äôt answer, or Trevor makes an excuse for not coming to the phone, they will be on their way by the next day. I hate that Maksim was right about Trevor. I hated being so blinded by love that I thought Trevor felt the same way about me. He has humiliated me, and I'll be happy to return to Black Adder. I'll lick my wounds privately and build my home near my parents' house. I‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôll try to remember the good times, or what I thought were the good times, when I tell the baby about their father. I‚Äôll raise my baby on my own. I don‚Äôt need Trevor for anything. I‚Äôll be damned if I allow my innocent baby to go to Still Water with Trevor and Heidi. That won‚Äôt be happening. I managed to get comfortable enough to nod off. My concern now is the fact that I can‚Äôt eat. They‚Äôll be able to scent the blood from miles away. I may have outrun them for the moment, but they‚Äôre still after me. Trevor won‚Äôt give up. He can‚Äôt allow me to escape. He might be able to keep my brother at bay for a week if he can take pictures of me showing that I‚Äôm fine. But it won‚Äôt last forever. He has no idea who he‚Äôs dealing with. My brother won't allow Trevor to keep me here against my will. Neither will my family. I need to focus on staying hidden until I can find someone to allow me to use their phone to call for help. I know the scent of the Still Water pack members. I'm paying more attention now. I won‚Äôt let anyone else to sneak up on me again. I have to hang on until help arrives. It took them some time to get here. I heard them before I saw them. I could tell that at least two hours had passed. I was about two hundred feet away from them but heard them speaking clearly. ‚ÄúShe couldn‚Äôt have just disappeared into thin air. Spread out and look around for her. She has to stop to rest. She was moving too fast for her not to need to rest. Even a vampire needs to stop moving to regain their strength. I know she‚Äôs around here somewhere. Start with where you lost her, and focus. We can‚Äôt lose her. I have an SUV coming out to pick us up. The team in the SUV will stay behind to search overnight,‚Äù Trevor announced. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre not on the graveyard shift looking for that parasite,‚Äù one of the trackers said with a laugh. ‚ÄúYeah, that leech will probably off at least two of them. I don‚Äôt want to be around to see her in action,‚Äù another warrior replied with a fake shiver of fear. ‚ÄúAgreed, that vein sucker is about to meet her end, and I‚Äôm glad. I hate having to look at her. She reminds me that our friends got slaughtered every time I look at her. She disgusts me. I don‚Äôt know what the Goddess thought when she paired you with her. She made a big mistake doing that. She is the shame of our pack,‚Äù another replied. ‚ÄúJust keep your noses peeled for the scent of blood. She's going to have to feed. She went to the doctor mid-afternoon. They always make her wait; I thought I had more time. I should've known that Melina would have come to tell me she was pregnant. I don‚Äôt know what she heard, but Beta Charles is in the hospital. She caught him by surprise when he caught her eavesdropping. We need to find her, and quickly. Her brother will be calling here tomorrow. If I can‚Äôt prove she‚Äôs okay, he will tear the pack apart looking for her. We can‚Äôt let them come here. If you thought those rogue vampires were dangerous, you haven‚Äôt seen the power their group wields. We can‚Äôt beat them, we have to find her,‚Äù Trevor stressed. There was a faint honk in the distance. ‚ÄúTheir here. I will stay here, and you guys wait for me. I need to give them their instructions,‚Äù Trevor stated. As soon as they were gone, Trevor called out to me. ‚ÄúMelina, I know you are hiding from us. You need to come down now; otherwise, when we find you, we‚Äôll kill you. Stop causing issues, and come to me. I don‚Äôt know what you think you heard, but I can explain everything.‚Äù It took his men five minutes to get to where we are. I didn‚Äôt respond, and he sighed and gave them their orders. ‚ÄúFind her. I believe she's hiding somewhere close. Either in the brush or the trees. Stay together. Shoot her if you need to, to get her down. Then kill her. Make it look like an animal attack. Don't leave evidence behind. Injure her, then leave her alive for a bear, or mountain lion to finish, but don‚Äôt let her get leave here alive,‚Äù my mate advised",1,1750160200.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I think he‚Äôs also planning to propose sa girl friend niya soon. Mahilig lang mangbwiset itong tropa ko na to but I can swear na matino and mabait na tao naman to. Everyone in the team is very comfortable with him and siya talaga madalas na nilalapitan dahil bukod sa one of the top performers siya, mabait naman talaga.

Since last year ang dami nagbago sa team dahil required na ulit kami pumasok twice a week, mas naging close yung team as a whole. Particularly, meron isang girl sa team who I will call Girlypop, na parang na-adopt na namin ni Bro kasi nag-resign na din yung closest friend niya sa team. She‚Äôs very introverted and usually nakahiwalay sila ng pwesto nung nandito pa yung closest work friend niya. Ngayon, samin ko na siya pinapatabi, nakakasabay umuwi and nakakasama na din namin siya lumabas.  Ang unexpectedly witty and super funny din kasi ni Girlypop kaya madali and enjoy din talaga siyang kasama.

Recently, nafi-feel ko lang na may hidden crush si Bro kay Girlypop. Hindi ko din siya masisisi kasi ang ideal talaga ni Girlypo. Maganda, matalino, ang likable ng personality, well spoken and one of the top performers in the team. Siya yung lowkey and tahimik lang sa gedli pero ang memorable pa rin ng presence niya. Same lang naman trato niya sa amin na usual asaran ng magtotropa. But one of the things na napapansin ko is lagi niya nababanggit and napupuna si Girlypop regardless kung kasama namin siya or hindi. Even sa GC namin with our work friends na resigned na and hindi naman naging ka-close si Girlypop nababanggit niya pa din. Isa pa sa na-notice ko is lagi siya nagi-insist na isama si Girlypop. For example, if mag-coffee break, meron ako mga workmates na mahilig magpasuyo sa amin na magpabili and Bro would always say sure pero kapag si Girlypop na, he would insist na sumama na lang siya. Another instance is, meron vacancy sa project na hinahandle namin due to resignation and ang agad na ni-recommend ni Bro na pumalit is si Girlypop even though meron kami other very close work friend (mas close pa namin kay Girlypop) who previously expressed interest to join us.

As someone who is also in a long-term relationship, napaisip lang ako how I would feel if  I find out that my fianc√© admires someone at his workplace and medyo kumirot ang heart ko. I trust Bro naman and wala naman ako nakikitang mali or inappropriate sa mga actions niya towards Girlypop.

When, in December 1953,¬†*Dragnet*¬†became the first American television show to broadcast in color, few fans knew they had a dusty nook on the California-Nevada border to thank for bringing it to polychromatic life. But every early cathode-ray tube color television owed its screen‚Äôs red hue to europium, a rare earth element excavated and processed exclusively at the Mountain Pass Mine in San Bernardino County.

From the 1950s to the 1980s, Mountain Pass produced practically all known quantities of europium, as well as over 90% across the spectrum of rare earth minerals worldwide. Back then, of course, uses were limited: apart from europium adding vibrancy to L.A. cop procedurals, cerium was used as a glass polishing agent, while lanthanum was‚Äîand still is‚Äîcrucial for oil cracking, or turning crude into gasoline and other lighter fuels.

Today, however, the picture is very different. Rare earth materials are vital for myriad industries, from advanced weaponry to wind turbines and robotics. But far from the U.S. having a monopoly on production, now some 96% of rare earth minerals are sourced from China, propelling these arcane materials into center stage in the escalating trade war between the world‚Äôs top two economies.

In response to President Donald Trump imposing tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods, as well as curbing the sale of strategic U.S. technology including semiconductor chips, China hit back by restricting the export of rare earth elements. Auto¬†[manufacturers](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-rare-earth-export-curbs-risk-halting-german-car-production-lobby-group-2025-06-03/)¬†across the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Germany and India have warned the shortages may¬†[force factories](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-curbs-exports-strategic-minerals-2025-02-04/#:~:text=German%20automakers%20became,factories%20could%20close.)¬†to halt production.

The spat prompted Trump to hit out at China for reneging on a nascent trade deal between the superpowers. Then, last week, Trump¬†[revealed](https://time.com/7292207/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-timeline/)¬†a ‚Äúframework‚Äù struck in London that supposedly will ease U.S. access to China‚Äôs rare earth minerals and magnets in exchange for setting tariffs on Chinese exports at 55% and a relaxing of¬†[curbs on Chinese students‚Äô access](https://time.com/7289945/us-china-trump-rubio-international-student-visa-restrictions-trade-negotiations/)¬†to U.S. colleges. ‚ÄúFull magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China,‚Äù Trump posted on Truth Social.

But reports from Washington suggest that the deal will expire in just six months, and with U.S.-China relations continuing to spiral, how America and its allies can break itself free of its Chinese rare earth dependency is a geopolitical priority. While it‚Äôs a question with sweeping economic ramifications, it‚Äôs also one with no easy answer.

# ‚ÄúEverybody wants to just snap their fingers and start producing heavy rare earth elements,‚Äù says Mark Smith, CEO of rare earths firm NioCorp, who has worked in the industry for almost four decades. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs a very long, hard process. And the longer we wait, the further China gets ahead.‚Äù

China has bet on rare earths for a long time. Back in 1992, reformist leader Deng Xiaoping declared: ‚ÄúThe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.‚Äù

China accompanied this strategic focus with billions of dollars of investment in mines and processing facilities to monopolize the market. Just like countless strategic industries, China wielded huge state subsidies, and little concern for environmental or safety standards, to produce rare earths at a fraction of the cost of Western competitors.

As a result, in 1998, Mountain Pass‚Äô separation plant ceased producing refined rare earth compounds. Four years later, a toxic waste spill led the mine to close altogether, and intense Chinese competition impelled the decision not to reopen.

At the same time, uses of rare earths were just ramping up. Today, yttrium is used in lighting and flat screens; ytterbium in cancer treatments and earthquake monitoring; erbium in lasers and fiberoptic cables. But particularly important are permanent rare earth magnets, which account for a quarter of total rare earths consumption and are a vital component in actuators, or devices that turn a control signal into mechanical motion. These could be robot arms on assembly lines, the fins of a ballistic missile or stealth bomber, or any of the multiple motors of an electric vehicle.

But it‚Äôs not just EVs that rely on actuators and, by extension, permanent rare earth magnets. Conventional internal combustion engine vehicles are also heavily reliant on these materials. That is how, in 2010, China managed to bring Japan‚Äôs auto industry to the brink of collapse by¬†[halting](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html)¬†exports of rare earth materials amid a territorial spat in the East China Sea.

[Neodymium is displayed at the Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. factory in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China, on May 5, 2010. Nelson Ching‚ÄîBloomberg\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/xhmn8hw9og7f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8abe6e1201bc6084128a5e46407301f3b2612413)

In the following year, prices of rare earths¬†[soared](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/japan-rare-earths-huge-deposit-of-metals-found-in-pacific.html#:~:text=As%20a%20major%20electronics%20manufacturer,sources%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Journal.)¬†by 10 times and the incident served as a wake-up call that was only partly heeded. Japan invested in alternative sources, particularly in Australia, though remains heavily dependent on Chinese supplies. That September, the U.S. House passed the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act to subsidize the revival of the American rare earths industry, including reopening Mountain Pass, which resumed production in 2012 only to fall into bankruptcy three years later. Today, under the new ownership of MP Materials, it remains the only functioning American rare earth mine.

Crucially, however, not all rare earths are created equal. What are termed rare earths are in fact a ‚Äúbasket‚Äù of 17 elements with overlapping but ultimately unique properties. Regarding permanent rare earth magnets for actuators, the most common element is neodymium, which can be sourced from Mountain Pass. The problem is that for actuators to work at high temperatures‚Äîlike those found under a car‚Äôs hood‚Äîthe neodymium needs to be mixed with either dysprosium or terbium, distinct rare earth minerals which are not significantly present in the Mountain Pass ore body.

In fact, China controls practically 100% of global supply of dysprosium and terbium and added both to¬†[export controls](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/)¬†on April 4. Tellingly, Beijing didn‚Äôt bother restricting sales of neodymium, cognizant of alternative sources‚Äîand the fact they are largely useless without their heat-resistant siblings.

So where can American firms source dysprosium and terbium‚Äîand fast?

At the Lynas rare earth mine in Mount Weld, Western Australia, yellow diggers scoop the tawny earth and dump it into soot-stained trucks. Following on-site concentration, the semi-refined ore is then taken on a four-hour drive to processing facilities in nearby Kalgoorlie, or loaded on ships to Malaysia, where in the seaside town of Kuantan Lynas operates the world‚Äôs largest rare earth processing plant. Crucially, in May the Kuantan plant produced its first batch of dysprosium and is expecting its first terbium this month.

‚ÄúThis is an exciting achievement for Lynas and for manufacturers keen to secure a resilient supply of separated rare earths products,‚Äù Amanda Lacaze, CEO and managing director of Lynas Rare Earths, tells TIME. ‚ÄúWe have stated our intention to meet the needs of the U.S. Defense Industrial Base on a priority basis.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a great start, but given the insatiable global appetite for rare earths, many more sources will ultimately be needed. And other options are years from fruition.

It was with great fanfare that Trump¬†[signed](https://time.com/7282110/ukraine-minerals-deal/)¬†a deal with Ukraine in March that ostensibly handed half the war-torn nation‚Äôs future oil, gas, and mineral wealth‚Äîincluding rare earths‚Äîto the U.S. The only problem is that Ukraine may have abundant reserves of lithium and titanium, but it¬†[doesn‚Äôt actually have rare earths](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals)¬†in any sizable deposits worthy of exploitation.

What about Greenland? Trump has repeatedly touted buying or even invading the semi-autonomous Danish province, citing its mineral wealth. In March, Vice President J.D. Vance led a U.S. delegation including National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to Greenland. But while Greenland does boast 18% of the world‚Äôs total rare earth reserves, accessing them is extremely problematic, owing to freezing temperatures and a thick layer of silica. Chinese, American, and European prospectors have spent decades trying to figure out how to extract these resources without any success. Today, Greenland has no functioning rare earth mines.

Other options are more feasible. Brazil has the world‚Äôs third largest reserves of rare earths and is aggressively exploring this space, while Saudi Arabia also boasts significant deposits and signed a cooperation agreement with the U.S. on critical minerals during Trump‚Äôs visit in May. MP Materials and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs national mining company, Maaden, also¬†[signed](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/Maaden-and-MP-Materials-Collaborate-to-Establish-Full-Value-Chain-for-Rare-Earth-Magnetics/default.aspx)¬†a MoU to collaborate on establishing a rare earth supply chain in the Gulf state.

Meanwhile, Japan‚Äôs state-owned energy firm JOGMEC and gas firm Iwatani have¬†[unveiled](https://www.mining.com/web/japans-jogmec-iwatani-to-invest-120-million-in-french-rare-earths-project/#:~:text=The%20$1.83%20billion%20all%2Dstock,Equinox%20from%20the%20current%20seven.)¬†plans to invest up to $120 million in a French rare earths refining project.

And with Africa boasting four of the top 10 nations for rare earth exploration last year‚Äînamely South Africa, Namibia, Uganda, and Malawi‚Äîthe continent stands to play a huge role in future supply chains.

But there are also options closer to home. Other than Mountain Pass, Lynas has¬†[secured](https://lynasrareearths.com/u-s-dod-strengthens-support-for-lynas-u-s-facility/)¬†$258 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to build a heavy rare earth refinement facility in Seadrift, Texas. ‚ÄúThe U.S. facility has been designed with the capability to process feedstock from other sources as and when they become available and are qualified,‚Äù says Lacaze.

# Meanwhile, NioCorp has the permits to build a rare earth processing facility at its Elk Creek Mine in Nebraska and is currently waiting on a $780 million financing agreement with the U.S. Export‚ÄìImport Bank for the $1.2 billion project, which will take around three years to get online. Smith, the NioCorp CEO, says he is currently 2.5 steps through a four-step approval process, which if greenlighted will provide up to 1,500 jobs during construction followed by a 450-strong full-time crew. Although Smith predicts Elk Creek could service all Department of Defense dysprosium and terbium needs, he‚Äôs under no illusions about the scale of the challenge.

# ‚ÄúOne thing absolutely for sure is that NioCorp, by itself, is not the whole answer to the problem,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre rooting for anybody to be an additional part of the solution. We need to put all the parts together to really be formidable against China.‚Äù

[SOME GOOD READING THIS MORNING WITH COFFEE!!!  ](https://preview.redd.it/1h8d843oog7f1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=632878bd213764ace1d0810b0d5ca809bbff570d)

Unfortunately, simply seeding projects in friendly countries doesn‚Äôt solve the problem. For one, China controls the separation and refining equipment market and placed export controls on those technologies in December 2023. Today, the rare earth refining industry is scrambling to reverse engineer Chinese technologies or innovate entirely new ones.

***There is also the matter of expertise. Refining rare earths is ‚Äúa whole new art unto itself,‚Äù says Smith. Heavy rare earth elements are extremely close to each other in terms of their atomic weights, making the process to separate each from the other at sufficient purity levels for commercial or military applications extremely taxing.***

***‚ÄúThere‚Äôs chemical engineering involved, there‚Äôs physics, there‚Äôs kinetics,‚Äù says Smith. ‚ÄúIt takes a whole bunch of knowhow, practice, and art to get heavy rare earths into their final purified oxide form. As well as a big investment.‚Äù***

The cash injections needed keep on growing. Lynas‚Äôs Texas project, for one, is currently stalled as the firm seeks more government funding on top of the nine figures already pledged. ‚ÄúFollowing design changes to accommodate local permitting, additional CAPEX will be required, and Lynas is in discussion with the U.S. government with respect to this funding,‚Äù says Lacaze.

But even if all these new rare earth projects are realized across the globe, challenging Chinese dominance must still overcome its toughest obstacle: price.

China has spent decades building out massive capacity for rare earth minerals, so all other competitors operate at a huge disadvantage. ‚ÄúThe inside China price is used by outside China customers as a benchmark,‚Äù says Lacaze. ‚ÄúWe have not observed any intent from the majority of non-Chinese consumers to pay a significant premium to the inside China price.‚Äù

But even if all these new rare earth projects are realized across the globe, challenging Chinese dominance must still overcome its toughest obstacle: price.

China has spent decades building out massive capacity for rare earth minerals, so all other competitors operate at a huge disadvantage. ‚ÄúThe inside China price is used by outside China customers as a benchmark,‚Äù says Lacaze. ‚ÄúWe have not observed any intent from the majority of non-Chinese consumers to pay a significant premium to the inside China price.‚Äù

Moreover, China‚Äôs massive processing capacity means it just opens the spigot whenever a potential competitor emerges to price them out of the market. The Chinese state has no problem eating any short-term losses to maintain key strategic levers over the global economy. It‚Äôs a similar dynamic for many different minerals, including cobalt, nickel, and titanium. Today, neodymium oxide costs less than $60 per kilogram‚Äîaround half its 2023 cost‚Äîand is¬†[forecast](https://www.statista.com/statistics/450152/global-reo-neodymium-oxide-price-forecast/)¬†to get even cheaper.

‚ÄúOne of the biggest challenges we face is that rare earth prices are very low,‚Äù says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ‚ÄúAnd a lot of that has been achieved through market manipulation by China increasing and increasing production.‚Äù

***The cost issue looks frankly impossible to solve. Other than technical challenges, refining rare earth minerals uses a huge amount of water. Back when China was first ramping up its rare earth industry, wastewater was just discharged into the nearest river, although environmental standards have tightened considerably in recent years. In the U.S. or other developed economies, wastewater must be evaporated in huge kilns to isolate and dispose of pollutants‚Äîthough this is a very energy intensive and thus costly process. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not something that China has to do,‚Äù shrugs Smith.***

So, the big question is how American‚Äîor Saudi or African‚Äîrare earths can survive in such a cost-competitive marketplace. Various mechanisms have been considered: One is a¬†[Contract for Difference](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp)¬†model, which is common in agriculture and says that if prices fall below a certain point the government will pay the difference. Another option is having the government serve as an¬†[Offtaker of Last Resort](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/what-is-an-offtake-agreement/), agreeing to buy minerals at a certain price if nobody wants them on the open market.

However, ‚Äúin the U.S., at least in an era of¬†[DOGE](https://time.com/7222251/doge-musk-federal-workers-government/), putting in an indefinite OPEX subsidy is quite politically unpalatable,‚Äù says Baskaran. ‚ÄúBut it is what China will do, so how do we compete against a country that‚Äôs willing to inject fiscal support at any part of the supply chain to retain their dominance?‚Äù

Another potential solution is one very close to Trump‚Äôs heart: tariffs. By hiking levies on Chinese rare earths, the U.S. could strongarm firms to source from preferred friendly nations. But this essentially shifts the cost burden from government to businesses, undermining their global competitiveness with unknown ramifications down the line.

***For Smith, tariffs are merely a stop-gap solution. ‚ÄúThe answer cannot be for President Trump to issue a tariff,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe need to be competitive with or without tariffs by increasing our technology, improving our processes, using more robotics. But we must have a legitimate business at the end of the day.‚Äù***

KANANASKIS, Alberta (Reuters) -Group of Seven leaders on Monday provisionally agreed on a strategy to help protect the supply of critical minerals and bolster their economies, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters.

The draft, which a source said had not yet been approved by U.S. President Donald Trump, also said minerals markets should reflect the real costs of responsible extraction, processing, and trade of critical minerals.

China's decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets disrupted supplies needed by automakers, computer chip manufacturers and military contractors around the world.

Trump last week said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States.

Rare earths and other critical minerals, though, remain a source of leverage for Beijing.

""Non-market policies and practices in the critical minerals sector threaten our ability to acquire many critical minerals,"" the draft said.

""Recognizing this threat to our economies, as well as various other risks to the resilience of our critical minerals supply chains, we will work together and with partners beyond

the G7 to swiftly protect our economic and national security.""

This included anticipating critical minerals shortages, coordinating responses to deliberate market disruption, and

diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling, it said.

(NASDAQ: CRML) has been tapped by the US¬†Export-Import Bank (EXIM) for a loan worth up to $120 million to fund the company‚Äôs Tanbreez rare earth project in southern Greenland, as first reported by¬†[*Reuters*](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-us-export-import-bank-181712095.html).

The Tanbreez project ‚Äî situated on a 4.7-billion-tonne mineralized kakortokite unit that has been largely unexplored ‚Äî represents one of the world‚Äôs¬†[largest rare earth deposits](https://www.mining.com/featured-article/ranked-worlds-top-10-rare-earth-projects/).

In a letter issued last week by EXIM and seen by¬†*Reuters*, the New York-based Critical Metals has met the initial requirements to apply for the $120 million loan, which would have a 15-year repayment term.

The project would have to be ‚Äúwell-capitalized with sufficient equity from strategic investors‚Äù to receive the loan, EXIM stated in the letter of interest.

# 2026 production

According to¬†*Reuters*, the EXIM funds ‚Äî representing nearly half of the project‚Äôs estimated cost of $290 million ‚Äî would be used for technical work ahead of first production by 2026.

***Once operational, the Tanbreez mine is initially expected to produce 85,000 tonnes of rare earth concentrates per year, then scaled up to 425,000 tonnes following a modular expansion. Its mining licence is valid until 2050.***

The production forecast is based on an estimated resource of 45 million tonnes, or just 1% of the host rock. According to company estimates, the Tanbreez resource has one of the largest heavy rare earth contents (Dy, Tb, Y) globally over 27%.

***Earlier this year, Critical Metals released***¬†[***an economic assessment***](https://www.mining.com/pea-values-critical-metals-tanbreez-rare-earth-project-in-greenland-at-3b/)¬†***for the Tanbreez project, showing a net present value of approximately $3 billion (approximately $2.8 billion to $3.6 billion at discount rates of 15% and 12.5%, respectively, before tax) and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 180%.***

***As part of its efforts to de-risk the asset ahead of production, the company is in the process of completing a definitive feasibility study for Tanbreez, which would include more details such as project timelines. The study is expected by the end of 2025.***

Critical Metals also said it expects to invest another $10 million in exploration this year, so that it would trigger the option to acquire an additional 50.5% of the asset, bringing its total ownership to 92.5%.

# Battle for rare earths

***EXIM, acting as the US government‚Äôs export credit agency, said in the letter that CRML qualifies for its loan program since its business competes with China.***

Rare earths ‚Äî a group of 17 minerals used in¬†high-tech industries ranging from electric vehicles to defense systems ‚Äî have become a focal point in the recent Sino-American trade clash, given Beijing‚Äôs leverage as the leading producer and exporter to Washington.

China currently¬†[controls roughly 60%](https://www.mining.com/china-flexes-rare-earth-dominance-with-million-tonne-discovery/)¬†of rare earth production and nearly all of the processing capacity worldwide. As of 2023, its total mine production was 240,000 tonnes, nearly six times that of the US. Between 2020 and 2023, China accounted for about 70% of America‚Äôs rare earth imports.

This heavy reliance on Chinese supply ‚Äî which Beijing managed to weaponize in trade policy ‚Äî sparked a global hunt for new rare earth mines. As of now, the US only has one active rare earth mine ‚Äî the Mountain Pass in California owned by MP Materials (NYSE: MP).

‚ÄúThis is a tremendous milestone for Critical Metals Corp., which highlights to the rare earths supply chain, Western governments and investors that Tanbreez is a world-class asset that will provide mission-critical rare earth metals to counter China‚Äôs continued dominance,‚Äù Critical Metals CEO Tony Sage said in a press release Monday.

Shares of Critical Metals soared on the news, trading 21.4% higher at $2.46 per share by 10:25 a.m. in New York, for a market capitalization of $225.8 million.

# Interest in Greenland

# Should the EXIM loan be approved, Tanbreez would become the first overseas mining project to receive US government funding under the Trump administration.

The letter underscores US interest in Greenland‚Äôs vast endowment of resources and critical minerals dating back to the Biden administration. It was reported that US officials visited Nuuk as recently as last November as part of ongoing efforts to get private investment in the island‚Äôs mineral sector. According to¬†*Reuters*, US officials had lobbied Tanbreez‚Äôs then-owner¬†[not to sell to a Chinese developer](https://www.mining.com/web/us-lobbied-greenland-rare-earths-developer-tanbreez-not-to-sell-to-china/)¬†and instead sell to Critical Metals.

President Donald Trump also made no secret of his desire to ‚Äúown‚Äù the Danish territory. Earlier this year, Vice President JD Vance made a quick trip to Greenland to make Trump‚Äôs pitch.

Despite growing interest, Greenland‚Äôs mining sector has seen little progress in recent years due to limited investor interest, bureaucratic challenges and environmental concerns. Currently, there are only two small mines in operation.

As for Critical Metals, the company would still have to build a processing facility, and its representatives said their goal is to process the material inside the US. The company had previously applied for funding to develop a processing facility from the US Department of Defense, but the review process stalled ahead of Trump‚Äôs inauguration.

For the EXIM loan‚Äôs additional funding requirements, Critical Metals told¬†*Reuters*¬†it is considering offtake agreements, royalty streams and funding from other US governmental agencies.

I [foolishly] attempted to remove the dipstick while the engine was running.*

*This was right after I had spent a whole week replacing various parts and every fluid (I am third owner of a 2011 Aero VT750C). It was ready to roll, minus a wiring issue for one of the running lights.*

*So now I'll be following these steps:*


‚úÖ Stage 1: External Recovery & Initial Oil Inspection

Tools Needed:

    Drain pan
    Clean funnel and container
    Fine mesh strainer / coffee filter / shop towel
    Flexible magnetic wand
    Borescope with hook/magnet attachment
    Shop rags, gloves, container for old oil


Steps:

1. Ensure the bike is cool and stable on center or rear stand.
2. Remove dipstick. Insert magnet wand to attempt fragment retrieval.
3. Drain engine oil (ambient 80¬∞F is sufficient).
4. Filter drained oil through coffee filter or mesh into clean container.
5. Inspect residue for:

    Metallic fragments (shiny, magnetic)
    Non-ferrous particles (e.g., aluminum)
    Size and quantity of debris

6. Use magnet wand and borescope through drain and dipstick ports to check for additional fragments.
7. Cut open and inspect old oil filter (optional but recommended).

---

‚úÖ Stage 2: Disassembly for Internal Inspection

Tools & Parts:

    Socket/hex set, torque wrench, breaker bar
    Drain pan for coolant (if required)
    Screwdrivers, pliers, zip bags for bolts
    Gasket scraper, razor blade
    Gasket(s): Right crankcase cover, oil pan (if applicable)
    Oil filter, drain plug washer
    RTV (if specified in service manual)


Steps:

1. Remove exhaust components if they block access.
2. Drain coolant if service manual shows any coolant passages near the right crankcase cover.
3. Remove bolts and carefully take off the right crankcase cover:

    Note gasket orientation and stuck areas.
    Inspect cover interior for impact or scoring.
    Use borescope to examine crankshaft area, connecting rods, and oil pump drive.

4. Remove oil pan:

    Capture and inspect remaining oil and debris.
    Inspect oil pickup screen for blockage or metal.
    Clean pan thoroughly.

5. Optional: Remove oil pump if access is easy and damage is suspected.

---

‚úÖ Stage 3: Cleaning & Reassembly

Tools & Supplies:

    Brake cleaner / kerosene
    Compressed air (if available)
    Clean shop towels, magnets, brush
    RTV / gaskets / torque specs


Steps:

1. Clean visible internal areas with solvent and air.
2. Wipe mating surfaces clean and dry.
3. Apply new gaskets or RTV as needed.
4. Reinstall oil pan, torque bolts to spec (install magnetic drain plug).
5. Reinstall crankcase cover, reconnect coolant lines.
6. Refill oil and coolant to factory levels.
7. Install new oil filter.
8. Reconnect exhaust if removed.

---

‚úÖ Stage 4: Optional Flush and Engine Test (if confident no debris remains)

Steps:

1. Fill with low-viscosity oil (e.g. 5W-20 conventional).
2. Start engine and idle for no more than 30‚Äì60 seconds.
3. Shut off engine and drain oil immediately.
4. Filter and inspect this flush oil.
5. If clean, refill with 10W-40 and new filter.
6. Monitor engine closely for abnormal sounds or oil pressure issues.

---

‚ùì Stop and Seek Professional Help If:

    Visible gouging on crankshaft or rods
    Oil pump damage or no suction
    Oil pressure warning or engine knock post-reassembly
    Large volumes of glitter/shavings in multiple stages


---

Notes:

    Keep workspace organized using trays and bags.
    Photograph bolt locations before disassembly.
    Label parts for reassembly.
    Use torque wrench for final assembly.

You can check your service manual for part numbers, torque specs, and diagrams for each step.

It meant a drop from 30 litres rucksack to 23 or 25 litres metro. That was ok with a change to my work setup / kit but I noticed recently an issue that started only recently after several months of use.

I noticed that when full and closed the inner / main compartment outer fabic kind of drops a bit towards the opening when closed. This is like the lid is dragging it down. I have started to reach under the closed lid to check it is pulled up.

Has anyone noticed the main compartment might drop at the front? Is this a risk of losing some contents if resting on the top?

Finally, it is a shame the Borough large is not an office style bag with plenty of pockets and easy access pockets like the metro. Despite that should I go for one just to get the security or to make sure nothing comes out? OF course I am not convinced the metro will lose contents, it is more the fear of losing stuff over the reality I think.

Are there bags like the metro but more secure?

BTW in use I keep a cylinder of coffee and waterproof cover in one read pocket, Coffee cup in the other one. Once outer mesh pocket has an empty water bottle to fill up at work and the other side mesh pocket takes the excess strap when on the bike.

So here‚Äôs a ground-level, no-bs post about the state of RGIPT‚Äôs tech branch and college life as of 2024. Whether you're a curious fresher, a confused outsider, or just hate-watching this post ‚Äî welcome.

# üß¨ Origin Story (a.k.a. Why You‚Äôre Probably Here)

RGIPT was granted **INI status** specifically for *Petroleum* and *Chemical* Engineering. Most of the institute's old connections, resources, and faculty strength still lie heavily in those two departments.

The **tech branch (CSE, ECE, etc.) is just about 5 years old**, and obviously, we're facing the classic early-stage growing pains ‚Äî *labs that need revamping*, *faculties with limited connections*, and a *not-so-great placement scene*. But‚Ä¶

# üíº The TnP Twist (a.k.a. Why 2025 Might Be Different)

Here‚Äôs the catch nobody talks about:  
**Till now, RGIPT had no official TnP Officers.**  
All tech branch placements were literally done through *random faculty-level reach-outs*. Most tech profs being new = they had no network = you know the rest.

But here comes the **2024 protest + Naya Director arc**. Post-protest:

* We have a **completely restructured Training & Placement Cell**.
* **TnP now works** ***independently*** from college faculty interference.
* Talks are already in motion with **some Big Players** ‚Äî both for **placements and internships**.
* **Internships for 2nd years** is now actually being considered.

It‚Äôs too early to promise miracles, but the **structure has changed**, and **things are finally moving**.

# üß™ Tech Labs: The Ugly Truth

No sugarcoating.  
**Tech labs are** ***not good*****.**

* **No GPUs**.
* About **25% of lab PCs are missing keyboards and mice**.
* You *can* get your work done, but it's far from ideal. We‚Äôve raised this, and the new admin seems receptive. Let‚Äôs see.

# ü•ó Mess Food: Surprisingly Decent

**Honestly, RGIPT mess food is better than most govt colleges**, and even some IITs (yes, you read that right).

Here's what the food scene looks like:

* **5 days of pure veg meals**
* **2 dinners with non-veg options** (usually chicken for one dinner and egg curry for the other)
* Breakfast rotation includes:
   * **3 types of Parathas with chutney (different days)**
   * **Puri-Sabzi + Jalebi**
   * **Aloo Dosa or Idly (different days)**
   * Fruits like **watermelon** and bananas
* And yes, milk **and tea** run daily. (You may also find coffee powders)

Quality? Mid to good. Consistency? Better than you'd expect.

# üë®‚Äçüè´ Faculty Quality: Mixed Bag, Improving

* **Most tech faculties are new.**  All with PhDs from IITs. 
* **Petro & Chem profs?**  Mostly Great, some... well, be cautious.
* The **new director has assured a faculty revamp**, especially for **Tech & Mech**.

This isn't an IIT faculty pool, but for a growing branch, it's decent and improving.

# üß† Peer Group: Finally Some Brain Cells

* In **AY2024**, **most tech students are JEE Mains/Advance qualified**.
* This is a shift ‚Äî earlier batches were all petro/chem JEE Advanced admits.
* That said, **\~60% of petro/chem students in 2024 didn‚Äôt even qualify JEE Mains.**

Academically, the **tech batch has a higher average calibre** than the petro/chem batch *for the first time*. 

Let‚Äôs see how that plays out.

# üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Culture: From Nonexistent to Breathing

Honestly, there was **no coding culture** here. But seniors have put in the effort to build something.  
In just the last year:

* **CP contests**
* **Web dev competitions**

1ldkhts,https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/1ldkhts/i_wasnt_meant_to_be_a_mother/,I wasn't meant to be a mother.,"I never thought that I would become a regretful parent, because I always thought that the people who regret it the most are the ones that are young, poor, just didn't plan for this, or have a handicapped child. But here I am. I became pregnant in my mid thirties, planned pregnancy, with my amazing husband. We're financially stable. This child was planned. And I feel so guilty admitting this, but I don't enjoy being a mother at all. My child is 14 months. I feel like for the past year I've been trying to convince myself that I love this, but last night I slept so bad (partly because my child woke up screaming at 2am, but also because I'm sleeping like crap lately) that it dawned on me that I've been lying to myself. And I'm starting to wonder how anyone actually enjoys this? I don't understand.

I LOVE my child. Very much. But my favorite time of the day is when I drop her off at daycare, and when she goes down for the night. Being around her is so freaking exhausting 99% of the time. She whines pretty much all day long unless I sit on the floor with her actively play with her, or when we're at the playground. I can't even go to the bathroom without her whining or having a meltdown, I can't make myself a coffee, I can't do anything. Playing with her is so goddamn boring, she can't talk yet obviously. She has been walking for two months now and all I do all day is run after her and pull her away from stuff that can hurt her. When I take her to the park I see all these families sitting with their children on the grass, while their children happily play with their toys. Mine does not. Mine will run away immediately. In public, she does not care about any toys. She just wants to run away, and pick random things up from the floor and put them in her mouth (including cigarette butts). She also hates sitting in the stroller, in the carseat, and in the high chair so it's really hard to take her anywhere (unless I want to chase her around nonstop, which I do right now). She's also a terrible eater and refuses to eat food while sitting in her high chair, instead I have to hand her small pieces while she's running around the house, and most of that ends up on the floor anyways.

My husband is amazing and pulls his weight, but we do not have a village besides daycare. I miss my old life so much. I miss my husband so much. I'm so sick of the constant whining all day long. I'm tired of having to take her to places nonstop so she's entertained. I'm tired of chasing her around nonstop and not being able to sit at the park for one second. I hate that I'm always worried to put her in the carseat or stroller, because I know she's gonna start having a meltdown within minutes. I wish I didn't romanticize what it's like to have children. That's all. Thanks for reading.",11,1750159158.0,regretfulparents,3,0.92,False

1ldkepw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vilnius/comments/1ldkepw/your_guide_to_vilnius/,Your guide to Vilnius,"Hi there, I‚Äôve done my fair share of traveling, and if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned - it‚Äôs that the best spots to eat, drink, or explore always come from local recommendations. I‚Äôve tried every kind of research trick out there, but Reddit posts? They‚Äôve consistently been my lifesaver when discovering a new city.

So, I thought it‚Äôs time to return the favor. Born and raised in Vilnius, I‚Äôm sharing *my personal* list of places worth checking out. Roughly 90% of the places on this list are based on my own experience - so it‚Äôs less ‚ÄúTripAdvisor top 10‚Äù and more ‚Äúwhat locals actually enjoy.‚Äù



My recommendation is to book tables in advance especially if talking about dinner time and weekends.

**Night Clubs:**

Nightlife in Vilnius is rather safe, face control depends on every club‚Äôs policy, *my top suggestion is to always check what is happening on Facebook events*, because events like ‚ÄúDraugai Draugams‚Äù, ‚Äú1986 gallery‚Äù (most popular venue) have huge parties but usually tickets need to be bought in advance.

Anna Mesha. Butas (really popular, rather interesting place to visit as the club is made like an apartment. The face control is strict, quite hard to get in. For fancy people)

Soho (LGBTQ place)

Opium club (techno place, doesn‚Äôt work during summertime)

Youngs‚Äô club (always good vibes but check the event beforehand)

Bardakas (really basic pop music place)

Sanatoria (really basic pop music place)

Trinity (really basic pop music place)

Elastika (hard techno place, underground venue)

La Birra Pub (look, the place is *trash* but works basically everyday and long hours, give it a try if you wanna keep partying. But remember, it is TRASH)

Most of the nightlife happens in Vilnius street.



**Transport:**

For taxi you can use Bolt and Uber, usually Bolt arrives faster.

For public transportation, download the Trafi app. Can plan trips there, as well as buy different types of tickets. Keep in mind that you need to activate your ticket through the app and don‚Äôt forget to check how much time you have left.

For car sharing you can use Citybee, Bolt drive and Spark. All are easy to use and popular in Lithuania.



**Places to see:**

Gediminas castle tower

Vilnius Cathedral¬†

Gate of Dawn¬†

St. Anne‚Äôs church (the architecture is just phenomenal)

Three Crosses hill (be prepared for a bit of a hike)

Town Hall square

The republic of U≈æupis (take a lazy walk and notice all the little details)

Church of Sts. Peter and Paul

Glass quarter (always looks good)

Presidential palace



**Things to do:**

MO museum¬†

Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights

Luki≈°ki≈≥ kalƒójimas 2.0 ex-prison (book the tours in advance, highly recommend)

Vilnius TV tower (get a cup of coffee with great views or try the extreme activities)

Vingis park (take a stroll and see how locals go on dates)

Bernardin≈≥ park (nicely maintained)

The energy and technology museum

Lumber room (for car enthusiasts)

Nijinky Vilnius (cabaret)

Halƒós Market (has some nice places to eat)

Jazz Cellar 11 (tickets need to be bought in advance)

Hot air balloon flight (super popular in spring/summer)



**Good to know:**

Currency - euro, don‚Äôt really use cash around here

Emergency number - 112

Supermarkets - Rimi, IKI, Maxima, Aibƒó works everyday

Alcohol law - drinking age is 20; you can buy alcohol in shops till 8PM mon-sat, on Sunday till 3PM

Tap water is great and safe to drink

Tipping culture - it‚Äôs not a must but a polite thing to do, 10% is normal

National food - cepelinai (big potato dumpling with meat filling); potato pancakes; cold beet soup (a must to try); ≈°akotis (sweet treat, mostly found in shops); kibinai (handmade pies filled with all sorts of stuff, originally it‚Äôs meat); fried bread (trust me, you gonna love it)

Mark was able to stand out from the crowd but was Bianca able to do the same? Let‚Äôs just get right into her analysis‚Ä¶

______

*Series 10, Episode 1* - **Good**

Wasn‚Äôt too visible but appeared to be selling well at the coffee stand. She also had to deal with Sarah‚Äôs uselessness as team leader and she had a pretty notable confessional at the start of the day ripping into her leadership style.

*Episode 2* - **Bad**

Ducked away from the PM role despite the task clearly suiting her as her business plan was around fashion which Sugar called her out on in the boardroom. Both team‚Äôs products were awful and I don‚Äôt think Bianca really added anything other than suggesting for the random lights on the outfit.

*Episode 3* - **Good**

Came up with the ‚ÄòBeach Dreams‚Äô name for their candles and assisted with the branding/packaging which came out quite well. She wasn‚Äôt shown much during the corporate pitches (Mark and Roison took more of a lead) but she did assist with them in any case.

*Episode 4* - **Invisible**

This is one of those tasks where she wasn‚Äôt hidden or anything but it‚Äôs hard to find a meaningful contribution from her entire sub-team to be honest. She spoke well during the pitching of the viral video to Buzzfeed (she was shown speaking more than Mark) but they didn‚Äôt end up going with either team so not exactly a highlight there. They spoke with the online partners and backed someone else instead of Ollie White who Solomon ended up choosing due to his high view count. I think the most they did was remember to put description in their video which umm not sure if I can give good for that. In fact Jemma of all people was probably the best of the three simply for coming up with the ‚ÄòDare to Dine‚Äô name! Also I literally forgot after rewatching that Solomon‚Äôs team honestly didn‚Äôt even get that much more views on their video than Ella Jade‚Äôs did! I don‚Äôt know why it was treated like a blowout win to be honest?

*Episode 5* - **Bad**

Got too desperate in terms of the ticket selling, accidentally revealing to a whole bunch of customers that this was her ‚Äòlast chance‚Äô to sell them and therefore ended up a shifting a whole bunch of them for only ¬£40 which was way too low. Both her and Sanjay underpriced the tickets in general and seem to put in no thought about expected forecasts at all. Sad thing is even with this huge error I still would have brought James into the boardroom over her.

*Episode 6* - **Awful**

Gave away exclusivity for the whole of Westminster for 6 board games to a small shop. Such an asinine decision to the point where she would have been a guaranteed firing if her team had lost.

*Episode 7* - **Mixed**

The best thing she did as PM was correctly adopt James‚Äô idea of the ‚ÄòBig Dawg‚Äô brand that would have a lot of energy, be very colourful and make sure it would stand out. She also did excellent in the pitch and the clients really bought into what she was saying. On those aspects she did well but the TV advert she helped produce was universally panned (although Solomon did take lead on that) and she clearly did not communicate very well with the other sub-team and they were almost left to fend for themselves. Side note I get being annoyed but omg Sanjay was totally insufferable this episode.

*Episode 8* - **Good**

Noted to be a good saleswoman on the day, although Solomon was shown to be a little better.

*Episode 9* - **Good**

Negotiated well for the sink, getting it for only ¬£60 which was ¬£15 cheaper than the other team. She was also able to acquire the skeleton as well, the one Sugar didn‚Äôt have a problem with lol

*Episode 10* - **Fantastic**

Came up with the ‚ÄòTea Pot‚Äô brand name, helped create and manufacture the puddings in the kitchen and pitched very well. I think all of Roison‚Äôs team did an all around great job this episode.

*The Final* - **Bad**

The problem with Bianca here is that she just refused to listen to her team. She totally ignored what the market research had to say and isolated quite a few of her team members by not taking into account what they were saying about the high price of her tights as well as other feedback and then basically told half of them to go away! Even the experts at the presentation took note of the abnormally high price in which Bianca‚Äôs Q&A handling definitely left a lot to be desired.

**Bianca‚Äôs Final Stats**

Fantastic - 1 Episode 

Good - 4 Episodes 

Mixed - 1 Episode

Invisible - 1 Episode

Bad - 3 Episodes 

Awful - 1 Episode 

Wow her stats are‚Ä¶ kinda worse than what I thought. I didn‚Äôt remember she did poorly on quite a few of the tasks. Her final performance is debatably worse than even Chris‚Äô was as well. Sadly will be placing quite low in the rankings overall. I think these stats kinda prove why other candidates like Mark, Roison, Solomon are brought up a lot more in conversation as they just stood out way more in the process overall. Still Bianca isn‚Äôt a bad candidate by any means.

2: Ruth Badger S2

1ldk8fq,https://i.redd.it/zoemxio4zg7f1.jpeg,Storytime: The Crow Collector long description below.,"So after our previously posted arrest warrant.it was about 3am by the time I finally trudged back to our basement Appartment on the South east edge of Wissen. It's been a mere few days since we got repossessed and I hadn't quite had the time to furnish really. I figured for some reason now, the middle of the night was as good a time as any. Some Spartan fittings will do for now. I moved an old second hand armchair in front of the newly purchased TV. Carefully planted the side table and ashtray, and lit up for a moment of downtime we hadn't had for a couple days. Not since prior the Fournier stakeout, in which Fournier himself interrupted me from my sleep at 2am to confess to his second killing. He didn't know he was already prime suspect, but the finger prints he left all over his dead neighbours Appartment were the last nail in the coffin for that case. 

5am, I finally decide to get some sleep, I only manage about 4 hours before hunger and thirst drive me to the nearby diner for a terrible coffee and greasy fries chicken. As good a place as any to pick up another warrent. A hunt for ""H"" show size 11. In the nearby metalworks. It was just before I moved to execute the arrest that the call comes in... Another murder, Haysham Suites.
I step out of the elevator, it doesn't take long for the endorsers to get bored and move away. I am casing the ceilings, no CCTV this level. Dammit. I pick into the nearest breaker and shut off the security..it's time to get to work. 

Evander Haynes. She is slumped on the floor in front of the appartments TV. I can only find two sets of prints in the address. Hers, and her Partners.. Liang Huang. Either a gunshot or a stabwound, the tells are conflicting (conflicting notes on the case board) time of death, within the last 4 hours. 

Time to start prodding for some clues. Again, not even as much as a footprint that couldn't be determined as unusual. But Evander was definitely involved in at least a couple of shady groups. I am able to trace a name, Yoshida, a vmail demanding to satisfy ""Mutual friends"" 4 days ago. In the kitchen, I find a note from Evander, describing a male coming round the property at night and being followed. 

Skinny, male, Red hair. It's not much, but it's the strongest lead we have. 
I know that there is a security room on the 6 floor of the apartment block. It doesn't take much to break in, however the security employee, Christina Hernandes. Has tighter password security than most folk I have encountered since moving here. 

We have to go and get a codebreaker. On our return a shirt time later there is a new note on the desk, it is bloodstained. 

""Keep out, Rat"" 

Unphased, we get to cracking into the security guards cruncher in order to get access to the security footage from the previous 48 hours. I find success on the ground floor, a perfect match. Skinny, male, red hair. I take note of the face. 

Now, the task of putting a name to the face. For lack of anything better coming to mind I figure it worth going to Evanders workplace, Accounting Solutions. It just so happens to be in the same floor. Talk about convenient commute. 

I rounda corner to the receptionist, and there he is.. 
Skinny, Male, red hair. 

Now surely, if Evander was being followed by a work colleague she would have said so in her notes.. could it be possible I was jumping to conclusions? Could our suspect just have been commuting to work?? 

Hi what's your name? Christian Palmer. Do you know this person? That's my colleague, Evander.. died recently.. would you give your fingerprint? Sure no problem. See anything unusual? Do I look like a newspaper? 

The whole interaction is for the most part. All too.. cooperative. Again, I can't think of anything better to do than to search Mr Parkers address, since he was kind enough to give a name. I find an address book, parker lives in a different block. I get there and disable security, break in. 

His partner is there.. she pulls a gun on me, though part of me doesn't blame her. A trucheon to the face and quick work with my handcuffs, I get her pacified and disarmed while I case the appartments. 

There is nothing here that I can find that produces a motive. No hit orders or nothing. Questioning The partner is producing nothing, why would it? The only thing I can find is a knife in the kitchen with Parkers prints.. not enough on it's own. And maybe the gun that I have now confiscated. 

Against maybe my better wisdom, I release his partner. And depart before Parker can get back from work.. killers already onto me.. Parker or not, what difference will it make? 

I am wondering what to do next.. tail Parker? Arrest him on Circumstancial evidence at best? Or worse... Wait for a new victim? Part of me hopes that the next one the killer picks is me. 

Because then at least I'd known for sure.

If you ever needed a **spiritual energy drink**, Isaiah 40 is it. This chapter kicks off the second half of Isaiah, often called the ‚ÄúBook of Comfort,‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Think of it as God‚Äôs way of saying, *‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve been through some stuff, but I‚Äôve got you now.‚Äù*

# üí¨ God's First Words? Not Wrath‚Ä¶ But Comfort!

Right out the gate, God says:

>

This isn‚Äôt thunder and lightning‚Äîit‚Äôs a warm, fatherly embrace. The people of Judah had endured exile, hardship, and judgment. Now, God sends Isaiah to drop a **hope bomb** on their despair.

# üöß Holy Roadwork Ahead!

Cue the divine construction crew:

>

We‚Äôre not talking about potholes and orange cones. This is a **spiritual highway project**. Every valley of doubt gets filled. Every mountain of pride gets leveled. It‚Äôs time to clear the clutter because the King of Glory is coming through!

# üåø People Fade, but God‚Äôs Word Is Forever

God keeps it real:

>

Translation: TikTok trends fade. Politics shift. Even influencers burn out. But the Word of God? **Still going strong after 2,000+ years.** Put your faith in something eternal.

# üí™ God‚Äôs Resume: Creator, Star-Namer, Ocean-Measurer

Isaiah flexes God's credentials like a holy hype man:

* Measures the oceans with His palm? ‚úÖ
* Counts and names the stars? ‚úÖ
* Sees nations as a speck of dust? ‚úÖ
* Needs no coffee or naps? ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ

This is **next-level sovereignty**. You're not following a tired idol or an outdated tradition‚Äîyou‚Äôre walking with the all-powerful Creator of the universe!

# ü¶Ö The Grand Finale: Eagle Power

Now for one of the most quoted, most beloved verses in all of Scripture:

>

Let that sink in: **EAGLE MODE.**  
You may feel tired, burnt out, or broken down, but if you wait on God‚Äîtrust, hope, expect‚ÄîHe won‚Äôt just patch you up. He‚Äôll give you wings. Not chicken wings. **Eagle wings.**

You won‚Äôt crawl. You won‚Äôt limp. You‚Äôll **SOAR**.

# üî• Key Takeaways:

1. **God comforts before He commands.** His heart is tender, not tyrannical.
2. **Prepare your heart.** Get ready for His presence‚Äîclear the spiritual clutter.
3. **God‚Äôs Word is the only thing that never fades.** Trends are temporary; truth is eternal.
4. **God is bigger than your biggest problem.** Oceans, stars, time? He‚Äôs got it covered.
5. **Waiting isn‚Äôt wasting.** It's how you renew your strength and rise above the storm.

# ‚úùÔ∏è Final Thought:

Isaiah 40 is more than poetic prophecy‚Äîit‚Äôs **God‚Äôs personal pep talk** to His people. If you‚Äôve felt forgotten, burned out, or like you‚Äôre flying too close to the ground‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to lift your eyes, lock into His promises, and get ready to soar.

# üì£ Bonus Challenge:

Take a deep breath. Quote Isaiah 40:31 aloud.  
Then go face your day with **eagle-level confidence**.

- no smell during visits (3 visits before completion)

- no furniture left in room 
- 3 bed terrace, front bay room

There is a weird smell in my new living room, I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out what it is. It‚Äôs not overly powerful, but I have a very strong sense of smell. 

When the room is warm, it smells worse. 

The walls have all been painted and the room has been cleaned properly. There is no furniture in there other than 2 beanbags and a coffee table 

I would describe the smell as just a bit musky. Almost as if a group of people had slept in there the night before.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do? I‚Äôve left the window open for the last two weeks, and left a fan on.

Is there anyone I can pay to come out to identify what the smell is? It‚Äôs driving me bonkers

1ldk3c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1ldk3c4/the_biggest_reason_dating_relationships_are/,"The biggest reason dating & relationships are broken today is because men are comparing themselves to HOT men, mistaking how women interact with them as true measure of attraction, and giving up when their own experiences don't match","In the past, the details of women's relationships & flings with hot men would remain hidden from public eye, known only to their close friends and the hot men involved. The dynamics of these relationships never entered public discourse 

Unfortunately, social media allowed the details of these relationships and flings to be broadcasted to public, causing the ""manosphere"" to treat them as the benchmark of female attraction. 

**Examples of this line of thinking**

* She had sex with hot guys on the 1st and 2nd dates. If she doesn't want to get physical with me by the 3rd date, she's not attracted to me and I should move on.
* All her relationships with Chads started as hookups or casual flings. I should also get the opportunity to ""just hook up and see where things go."" If she tells me ""no hookups"" or ""no sex before exclusivity,"" she's not attracted to me.
* She liked rough, kinky, adventurous sex with her hot exes and FWBs. She only wants vanilla sex with me ‚Äî that means she's not attracted to me.
* My Chad friends‚Äô girlfriends and wives want to have sex daily. If my girlfriend or wife only wants it once a week, she's not attracted to me.
* She had a great sex life with her hot ex-boyfriend even though he never helped around the house. If she expects me to do chores before having sex, it means she's not truly attracted to me.
* She had sex with her hot ex-boyfriend even when he was toxic and she was mad at him. If she only has sex with me when all her emotional needs are met and everything in the relationship is perfect, she‚Äôs not truly attracted to me.
* All my Chad friends' girlfriends and wives initiate sex, make-outs, and physical affection. If my girlfriend or wife rarely initiates, she's not attracted to me.
* My Chad friends get asked out and flirted with all the time ‚Äî which shows women do ask out the men they‚Äôre into. If no one‚Äôs asking me out or giving me signals, it means women find me unattractive.
* All my Chad friends‚Äô dates are simple: they meet girls at a park, for coffee, or just ask them to come over for Netflix & Chill. Why should I have to put in extra effort and take women out on proper dates?
* Girls never flake on hot guys. All my Chad friends just message a girl, and she‚Äôs down to meet up the same day. Why do I have to schedule dinner dates a week in advance, only for girls to reschedule? That means they're not attracted to me.
* She was totally fine with her hot ex-boyfriends being lazy and uninterested in doing things together ‚Äî sexual chemistry carried the relationship. Why do I have to take interest in her hobbies and go to museums, festivals, feminist stand-up comedy shows, theatre, salsa classes, yoga, Disneyland, etc., just to qualify for the boyfriend spot?
* Why do I need a decently furnished 2-bedroom apartment to get a girlfriend, when my Chad friends live in cheap basements and still have no shortage of relationships?



I think women are more sensible and understand how exclusive and privileged the nature of their flings with hot men is and that it can't be replicated with most men.

Women don't compare themselves to top models who are flown to exotic islands, cruising on yachts and given Birkin bags as 1st date gifts by billionaires and conclude if we aren't being given that experience the men aren't truly attracted to us",9,1750157820.0,PurplePillDebate,44,0.71,False

First time posting, so patience appreciated! I (33F) met a 32M (we'll call him Jan) and we were bros immediately. I met him through a few good friends at an open mic that I frequently perform at, and this night I brought a mutual friend with me, Cass. It was clear pretty quickly that Cass wanted to get with Jan - they're both extremely attractive -so I wingmanned her to absolute death (even tho I 100000% wanted to smash her) and they flirted around and we all had big-goof-bro dialogue. I ended up leaving with Cass (lmao big W) but got Jan's number on some homie/'good fun hang' type-shit. A week later I run into him at the local watering hole and he's big-time flirting, so I take him home and it turns out he's my fucking neighbor a building over. He invites me to come stay, I tell him I don't wanna fuck him (a bitch be tryin not to bless any-old-body these days), he says that's fine, so I pull up. His roommates are also friends of mine, so we hang for a bit until he suggests we go to his room. He'd mentioned wanting to watch some show I can't remember and I legitimately tried to find it on his trash ass ACER and eventually gave up. We start to hook up, penetration happens, soft-serve ensues. He asks if ""we can stop and just hang out and talk for a minute"". I say it's fine, duh, let's rap. He proceeds to tell me that he'd had a recent mushroom trip that induced a heavy sadness about his ex of several years (not sure exactly how many) that he'd broken up with recently (I wanna say at least a year prior, not sure) and he was feeling uncomfortable with having sex. I gave him grace, we chatted tf up for about an hour or so, and then smashed.

Full transparency- I was tryna cuddle, but he \*kindly\* said he ""didn't like other people in his bed"" and of course by the grace of GOD I had a very short walk to my own bed and my pups & didn't have any time to take it personally. So the next day he calls me in the morning to come over for coffee and tells me he thinks we should just be friends. I honestly agree, cuz a bitch didn't feel fully ready (fuck every nigga alive tbh), and while I'm not exactly NOT trying to fuck him - I respect his boundary while also taking the opportunity to analyze my own. ""Like, what if I COULD be....emotinally....ava ilable . . ??"" I digress >>

Me, unfortunately being a hypersexual 'idiotbitch', says ""but we still gonna smash when we wanna, right?"" He agrees. God does not.

So, and this is the meat of the sandwich- we start spending every day together.  I'm a musician, so is he, we both play guitar, I sing, he rips and can learn most shit by ear - big jam mode. We literally aren't even smashing regularly, maybe 4 times tops over 4 months.

I was prepping for my first euro-trip & he's Eastern-European. He was in my prep-mode TRENCHES with me- fit checks, inspired me to pop off when I'm there and honestly set a solid foundation for me to do this big spook of a trip. Mans was pulling up to all my nail appointments that were 45mins a piece AND offering nail advice.

This dynamic went on for 2 months until I left for Europe for 3 weeks. I let him use my car while I was away. He called me every day, if I didn't call him first. Since I was in his neck of the woods (he Croatian)  he gave me tips, scenic shit advice, food shit tips, whatever. I almost got stranded at the airport in Vienna and called him crying like 9 times, no answer, HELLA embarrassing but I'm just trying to paint a picture of how acute dependence/reliance can be dense af with felt + projected gravity, idk, my mama n my bestie answered immediately soooooooo (shout out 2 every patient zero)

So fast-forward to the end of my trip - He picks me up from the airport with my dog. Weather's bad so we try to get a hotel - emphasis on TRY - and eventually end up in an extended stay for the night. No sex til the AM, accompanied by joint shower. I had about 4 days off until I had to work and each day was spent with him, respectfully. I gained at least 10lbs on the trip, pretty sure it was all in alcohol heh, so I promised myself it'd be a fit/sober bitch summer. I renewed my membership at the local gym and he & I made the plan to rock. On the 4th day, it was my usually scheduled open mic night, and we agreed we'd hit the gym afterwards (on-sched PM gym time). I call him after my set and he tells me that a girl (that he told me he'd been hooking up with on/off but told me he didn't really want to anymore, she was too wild, etc. who cares) Grace, is coming over. This girl is early 20s, hot af (I've heard) and offered to marry him for free for his green card. (All Ima say bout dat) Me, once again channeling my chill-girl-9000-pseudo-gayaf-persona says ""oh shit dude, u smashin?"" and he says ""no, its not like that, and i'd tell you to come over, but I don't want her to feel any tension"".

Although I respected our homie-ship, I felt in that moment he acknowledged that we weren't just friends. We didn't talk for 2 days after that convo, which was Fear Factor weird af, and when he finally texted me, he asked how I felt about ""being back at work"", which of course I did not dignify with a response. Like why the fuck and HOW the fuck u askin me bout work??????? And he's been kickin with Grace every night since (unfortunately I see her car in my lot lol)

Anyway, I got drunk a couple days later and called him just to see if any explanation would casually arise, and he just carried on like he was on the phone with his grandma - told me he was with ""a friend"" at ""a bar"" and didn't have ""plans"" idk i just hung up. It's absolutely bizarre to me, I feel like after 3-4 months of nonstop whateverthefuck you can communicate? I don't think I'm an idiot (when it comes to people) so I just feel so weirdly finnessed. I just don't want to come across as a scorned woman - I am genuinely fascinated by what the fuck is that/this ?? I take full responsibility for not establishing my feelings, truly didn't know i was ready to be wifed up, but it sucks to lose a friend?? Clearly dodged a bullet platonically and romantically, but what the heck!!

I'll also say, this has been a huge lesson for me- I've always been a homie-smasher of sorts- like when u fuck and high-five afterwards, but (unfortunately) that aint da emotional bag for me no mo - we lookin for da emotional  c l o u t MONSTERS fr

Here‚Äôs how it would work:

* One of us takes an instant photo (preferably a **square** format Instax or Polaroid) of something in our world. An aspect of your reality that says something about you. An object, a place, a person, a room, a scene - anything at all!
* When you receive the photo, you try to **recreate it as closely as possible** in your environment, whether it‚Äôs by mood, composition, or simply the equivalent of the original, but yours. 
* Then you send your version back with a letter about how you interpreted it, what you used, what you couldn‚Äôt replicate, and how it made you feel.
* Repeat.

Along with the photo it would be nice to exchange letters too - but the photo should always be included with the letter!

I'm a 21 year old girl (or woman I suppose) from England. I love analogue formats and anything old-fashioned. I am 3/4ths of the way through a chemistry degree, so in my downtime I default to anything creative, artistic, or expressive in a way that numbers and graphs cannot be.

Some of my fav things: bluebells, Elvis Presley, bookshops, hot chocolate (because I hate coffee), trying new hobbies, baking, embroidery + crafting in general, vintage fashion, cats, mary janes, the English countryside, fancy bath products, poetry.

  
Hopefully, somebody would be interested in setting this exchange up. :) I have a few penpals already who I've formed strong connections with through letter writing, but I thought this would be a fun and unique way to get to know a person, and a fulfilling creative project.",3,1750157622.0,penpals,1,1.0,False

Everyone around me seems willing to tell me what I SHOULD remember, but I can't help but feel like they are leaving out something VERY significant.""","New Feelings 

From what I last recalled (circa 8th grade), Kale's dad had died when we were super young....an accident involving a tractor. Kale lived with his mom, and pretty much started running the family farm as soon as he was old enough. I helped, although I wasn't very good at it. I just did whatever Kale told me and taught me to do. I distinctly recall that I did not enjoy working on the farm, but I did it because he was my best friend.¬†

Surprisingly and apparently, working on the farm with Kale is what I decided to do full time as an adult, and that's what I was ""going back to work"" to do today.¬†

My brain involuntarily flooded with memories of pulling calves from heifers' vaginas, shooting coyotes and mounting their heads on fence posts, and picking which hogs were ready for the slaughter. While Kale was represented favorably in each of these memories, the events themselves were not. Why the heck had I decided to do this as a career???

I realize my last memories are as a 13 year old boy, but I always thought I would do something...grand...or, at the very least, different? Farm work with Kale was not something I enjoyed at all. Maybe things had become tough for him when we graduated high school, I kept helping out, and 20 years later here we are? Running the farm like a middle aged married couple?¬†

Whatever the case, this is the life I woke up to today, and I was glad to be with Kale. By the way he acted toward me,¬† you would have thought he hadn't seen me in 37 years rather than just 37 days.

Contrary to my assumptions, he hadn't married Sarah Walton (his infatuation since 1st grade). In fact, he hadn't married at all. Also, he was running the farm entirely on his own now because his mom had gotten sick and was in ""a home"". 

He had turned the farm into a highly profitable business by becoming the primary pork and beef supplier in our county and our surrounding counties, but he seemed so lonely. As arrogant as it seems, realizing this made me feel important. Like Kale needed me in some way. This day is the first time I felt grateful since being back home from the hospital.¬†

I still didn't really understand or trust the internet at this point, so I had been keeping a journal. That first week of being with Kale my journal was full and gushing.¬† Every morning I woke up excited and every night I went to sleep excited, knowing my days were going to be spent with Kale.¬†

We didn't do a lot of, what I considered, work. Kale had several hired hands now who took care of the day to day chores on the farm. Between driving the parameter of the farm, jawing with employees, and Kale responding to business calls while I listened, we did about 2 hours of ""work"" each day. The rest of the day we played Playstation, made Vines, and drank beer (which I was old enough to drink now!).¬† On Wednesdays, Kale would take me home early and then go visit his mom. But I got to see him just a few hours later since he taught a youth boys' class at¬† church. 

I felt like Kale and I talked about everything and nothing. I remember telling my journal that Kale was the person I knew the best and the least. I tried asking him about his dad's accident once. This is the first time I ever witnessed him being serious. It was only for a moment and ended when he said, ""I don't talk about it"". Kale was pretty good about catching me up on everything my brain had deleted, so, naturally, I asked about his mom. I knew she wasn't much older than my mom, if she was older at all, and, yet, she required 'round the clock care. Something had to be wrong with her, right? My mom was still the church treasurer, still worked M-F at the bank, and, now, took care of me. She was definitely not the definition of a nursing home patient. Kale was as closed mouth about his mom's condition as he was about his dad's death. I cared about him too much to press either issue further, and just left it alone. It was sort of frustrating that Kale was such a question mark but didn't have to be, while I was a question mark and had to be. 

This one day, for example, I was sittin in the truck, feet up on the dash, relaxing, waiting for Kale to relieve himself behind a nearby, not nearly broad enough tree, and I heard his cell phone ring. Kale had taught me how to answer it and told me to take the call if it came from Buck Whitely...a rancher Kale had been trying to buy several head of Angus from that day. At that time I was still very clumsy with a cell phone, so as soon as it started playing Rockstar by Nickel Back, I hit the green call button and pressed it to my ear, not bothering or remembering to look at the caller ID. 

""Yellow"" I said jokingly giving my best Kale Rogers impression. 

""Can you be free at 6?"" the heavily accented voice on the other end said to me. 

I sat caught off guard and frozen for a minute, and then the voice said, ""Hola. Kale. Are you there?""

""Ummmm...no. This is Ryan. Sorry Kale is taking a leak and I thought you were Buck Whit...""

The voice cut me off with seemingly nervous laughter, ""Oh no problem amigo. This is officer Gonzales. Could you just have Kale text me when he is available?"" 

""Uh, yeah, sure thing man. Sorry about that again, I'm still trying to figure out how to use these things."" 

The voice continued the same sort of forced laughter and said, ""No worries. Adios."" And hung up.

Kale approached me as I was stumbling to hang up the phone on my end and asked if I was just talking to Buck Whitely. 

I explained, that no, even though that's who I expected was calling when I answered, it was actually Carlos or ""Officer Gonzales"". Kale's eyes widened once he heard the caller's name. He looked at me concerned and nearly demanded to know what Carlos wanted. 

I shrugged my shoulders to indicate how melodramatic the conversation was, hoping to calm this increasingly hot and bothered Kale down and said, ""Not much, just wants you to send him a text when you can"". 

Kale exhaled with what seemed to be breath of relief and muttered something about yeah he ""might"" text him later. Then I remembered how strange it was that Carlos called wanting to know if Kale could be free at 6 when today was Wednesday ‚Äì the day that Kale goes from work, to visiting his mom, then straight to church. No way he could be available at 6p. That would be right during his route between dropping me off at home and going to see his mom. So I mentioned it. 

""It was weird though because he was asking if you were free tonight around 6. He must not know you very well"" I said laughingly as I realized I was now jealous of Carlos. So jealous that I was patronizing his lack of knowledge about Kale's Wednesday schedule. 

Kale replied, ""yeah he must have been confused. We play cards on Thursdays at 6 sometimes, must've been what he was talking about. Just forgot what day it was.""

I felt my heart sink, much like it did when Katie Presley refused the couple skate with me on the 3rd grade field trip. At that moment I realized two things. One, Kale might have a life outside of me. Two, Kale wasn't being honest with me. 

You see, I know Kale Rogers. I know that he mumbles out loud when he reads to himself. I know that he snores when he sleeps on his left side. I even know that he has a freckle on his left testicle. And I know that Kale Rogers gets red and splotchy all over his neck when he lies. When Kale looked at me and told me that he ""sometimes"" play cards with Carlos on Thursdays, he looked like he had just washed his throat with sand paper. Kale Rogers was my best, and only, friend, and he was lying to me. 

I didn't confront him about it that day. I skipped church that night due to not wanting to face Kale yet. Instead, I stayed home and reflected about it in my journal. Why was I so hurt by the events that had occurred that day? Why did it bother me that Kale may have interests other than me? Why did I expect to know everything about Kale's life? And what could Kale and ""Officer Gonzales"" (I said his name condescendingly inside my head that night several times) possibly be up to that I couldn't know about. I had two more days of work left for that week but opted for asking my mom to tell Kale I wasn't feeling well enough to come in and that I didn't want to get him sick. That was a lie. Well, sort of. Physically, I felt fine, but emotionally I felt crushed. Like someone had dropped my heart from a 32 floor building and then stomped and spit on the pieces. 

I spent the next 3 days in bed eating cheese melted on chips and watching any show that ended in ""Real House Wives"", even turning the tv volume up loud enough so as not to have to pause the show during trips to the bathroom. By Saturday morning, I guess my mom could tell something was up. I'm certain she could tell before that, but respectfully tried to give me time to sort things out myself. Apparently, seeing me almost comatose again for nearly 72 hours was enough to push her into intervening. She brought me a cup of hot cocoa in bed that morning (she had finally realized my passive distaste for black coffee) and read to me the passage 1 Corinthians 13. I hugged her and cried...uncontrollably. The scripture had helped me realize several things and brought my broken heart some much needed reprieve. 

I woke up the following Monday morning, ripping, roaring and ready to work. I remember being almost giddy to see Kale that morning, wishing I had the strength to scoop him up and cradle him like he did me that first morning of work after my coma. The ride to work was euphoric. We listened to old country and shouted the lyrics we knew. Once we got to the farm, Kale put the truck in park and turned off the ignition. No more music. Just me, him, and the sounds of farm life. He turned and looked directly at me and said, ""Man I'm so glad you're back to work. Not gonna lie, them two days you were sick reminded me of when you were gone before and it put me in a real bad spot... ya know...emotionally"". 

I looked at him endearingly and shook my head to confirm that I knew exactly what he meant, and then, I leaned my body in toward his and put my lips on top of his.

It didn't matter that much though, because I just wanted to lay down in bed and watch some cable t.v. A simple task that turned out to be easier dreamt of than done. First of all, my bedroom t.v. was HUGE now but only half of it was there. My mom assured me that it would work without the ""back part"" and showed me how to turn it on (even remotes were different now). Then, we didn't have cable anymore! This led to a mind blowing conversation about the internet and streaming services and how people don't use actual cameras anymore. I remember getting really sad and really tired at this point and I asked my mom if I could just lay down...no t.v....just bed. 

For the next two weeks, every day was pretty much like this first one. I would expect something to be normal, my mom would explain to me what it's new form of normal was, I would become quickly overwhelmed and exhausted, and I would go to bed. I slept A LOT those first two weeks. 

Then, the morning of my third Sunday home, my mom woke me up and told me to get ready for church. My mom's rule had always been that you are allowed one sick day from church a year...""after all, if you're sick and want to get better, church is the best place for healing"". She had allowed me to miss the past 2 Sundays and I knew that was really pushing the limits of acceptability. Without hesitation, I got up, showered, and started searching for my Sunday clothes. My mom said she had readied them for me in the laundry room. The clothes I found were loose and ill fitting, uncomplimentary to my skin tone, and paired with a rubbery pair of clogs... with holes in them. I scoffed at the lack of fashion sense I must have had pre-coma. My mom did not respond to this, but I paid it no mind and assumed she was distracted and hadn't really heard my razzing. 

Church was delightful. Almost nothing had changed there, which was very refreshing to my ever adjusting brain. The people looked the same, just older... a phrase I had been using often to describe myself during looks in the mirrors over the past few weeks. The song and music portion of the church service began and I immediately remembered how much I enjoyed this part. I remembered every word to every song and was so delighted to sing along. I was surprised to hear myself sing. It seemed I was better at singing than I remembered. Not sure this was noticeable to anyone else, but my return to church absolutely was. I was approached by every member of the congregation that day at least once to tell me how good it was to see me, how they have been praying for me ""for such a long time"", and how they knew I would ""find my way back to church"". I chuckled at most of these comments and replied with one liners like, ""It's only been 2 months"" and ""Ya know the doctor just wouldn't let me leave the hospital while comatose, no matter how many times I asked"". Not many people responded with mutual laughter, but they were all so terribly old now that it was difficult to tell if they even heard me. 

I continued going to church. First, every Sunday morning, then every Sunday Night too. Then on Wednesday nights, Sunday mornings, and Sunday nights. After a while, I started attending every time the doors were open (sometimes there were revivals and the church had services every night!). I loved it at church. When nothing else seemed familiar (my room, my body, current events), church did. It was consistent and predictable. 

Eventually, I joined the church choir. It was amazing. Singing was the best part of my week. I didn't really understand the words...they seemed very sexual toward Jesus, but I loved singing them none the less. Even though I wasn't certain where I stood with God or Jesus or church beliefs in general, I felt confident when I sang. Choir became the one place I truly felt like myself. I couldn't explain it, but I enjoyed it. 

Once some time had passed, my mom decided I was ""ready to work again"". I wasn't sure what that meant, but one morning the concept found me. It was a Monday morning, I believe. I had grown accustomed to sleeping in everyday but Sunday, however, this Monday morning held a different bouquet of surprises for me. I was awoken by my mom shaking me and saying ""It's time to get ready"". Similar to the first day of church, she had laid out a set of ""work clothes"" for me that seemed ill fitting and ill fashioned. Regardless, I got dressed. My mom made for me a cup of black coffee...which I did not enjoy...crunchy bacon, scrambled eggs, buttermilk pancakes, and gravy. A breakfast fit for a king, even though I was just a man in oversized Levi's. As I enjoyed most of the meal (the crunchy bacon and black coffee aside), there came a knock on our front door. My mother answered, pulling the door toward her and revealing what seemed to be a version of my best friend Kale. 

This version of Kale, much larger than the original, barreled into the house, scooped me up with both hands, and while holding me like an infant, cradled me and said with a cracking voice, ""Rye! I've missed you friend!"" Instinctually, I embraced him which made this moment a cuddle that my mother quickly interrupted. 

""Alright."" She said, democratically. ""I believe you both have work to do."" Kale sat me back down and straightened my clothes. This mother hen dynamic he displayed toward me seemed surprisingly familiar and comforting. And just like that, I was riding in a Dodge Dooley with a highly strange version of a highly familiar person. 

Kale had always been quite round and quite southern...this new version of him was, somehow, more of both. His smile went on for days. If his syrupy southern twang didn't make you feel like you were rolling in a tub of butter, his smile and off the wall anecdotes would. He looked and sounded different, but made me feel the same as he always had before. 

Now I had two tokens of familiarity in my life, church and Kale.

1ldjrhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ldjrhp/bruises/,Bruises,"I‚Äôve been getting random bruises lately. The kind that bloom in deep violets across my joints, like I‚Äôve been in a fight.

I began noticing the joint pain three weeks ago, always with the same pattern: aching in the morning, stiffness whenever I moved.

Hell, I‚Äôm only thirty and in the best shape of my life. The bruises just never made sense.

I went to the doctor last week. She ran tests, checked my blood work, poked around my joints.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong,‚Äù she said, perplexed. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your sleep?‚Äù

I told her I always sleep on time. Eight full hours. I don‚Äôt even consume caffeine after 12 PM.

But I admitted that I kept waking up in strange positions. One day I woke up with legs hanging off the edge of the bed, the other day with arms twisted awkwardly behind me.

She asked if something was wrong with my mattress. I told her it was firm and good as new.

She recommended I visit the Physiotherapy Department. Unfortunately, I was too busy to make an appointment.

It was a friend who suggested cameras. He joked, ‚ÄúMaybe your house is haunted.‚Äù

Of course, I laughed it off.

‚ÄúNo, seriously,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôll find out what‚Äôs causing the bruises.‚Äù

So I installed three small cameras: one in the corner, one in the hallway, and one near the patio door. I set up a live monitor on my nightstand, just in case.

The first night, nothing. Just me snoring.

The second night, I watched the feed before sleeping. I told myself I‚Äôd stay awake this time. I didn‚Äôt.

So I reviewed the footage the next morning, still sitting on my bed.

Suddenly, I nearly dropped my coffee.

At 2:18 AM, I sat upright. Not slowly; jolted. Like something had snapped inside me.

I walked stiffly toward the backyard door, with my arms at my sides. My movements were uncanny and robotic.

I shuddered just watching it.

As I wandered in my sleep, I bumped into furniture. Knocking over bottles, bags, and books.

Then I stopped at the glass door that connects my bedroom to the patio.

I stood there for a good few minutes like a statue, and then I slumped face-first onto the glass door, slightly opening it, and fell onto the floor. Just like that.

A few moments later, I stumbled back up and threw myself onto the bed in an awkward position.

So that‚Äôs what had been causing the bruises: sleepwalking.

I almost reached for the keyboard to stop the footage, relieved.

Until I saw something else happened.

From the slightly open patio door, a figure appeared.

A full-grown man in filthy clothes. His face was hidden in darkness. He tiptoed inside and silently slid the door shut behind him.

Then he looked straight at the camera.

I leaned in, my heart almost exploded.

The last thing I saw before the feed cut to static was the man grinning at the camera.

And perhaps a few dumb ideas in others' eyes!,"Not fact checked much cause the wiki has so little info and I kept having to skim through chapters to remember info, there might be some mischaracterization, most stuff in this are canon while most aren't, and I'm sure I'm still wrong in some areas, also, I didn't name the titles, just didn't wanna delete it.

1. Context for future use: The Discovery
‚Ä¢ Anthony told Kate the truth behind the new ""Christopher.""
‚Ä¢ The current ""Christopher"" is a fake, a shadow molded by Anthony to resemble the original, who died by suicide.
‚Ä¢ Anthony admitted to Kate that all the choices she made‚Äîevery obstacle‚Äîwere deliberately planted by him, believing it proves he controls everything.

2. Act II: The Belle Crisis
‚Ä¢ For context: One of the Belle twin dolls (faces) dies due to illness and starvation, stemming from a punishment Barbie gave months ago (cleaning the soot room with clingers).
‚Ä¢ The surviving Belle is depressed and withdrawn. Unknown to most, Emilyko comforted her in secret, sending letters and giving her a handmade doll resembling her dead twin.
‚Ä¢ Belle went missing and possibly being held hostage. This is suspicious and threatens the fragile trust among the children.
‚Ä¢ Belle left behind a letter‚Äîmeant for Emilyko‚Äî only she could find due to trusting Emilyko to care enough to investigate her room, see the doll, and reminisce on where she is, touching  the handmade doll she put the letter in and feeling it.
‚óã The letter contains:
‚óã A heartfelt message to Emilyko.
‚óã Evidence and accusations against Anthony.
‚óã A failsafe warning that if Belle disappears, it's Anthony‚Äôs doing.

3. Act III: Emilyko Acts Alone
‚Ä¢ After a strategy meeting ends, (or so she thinks), that was disussing Belle's disappearance, how to find her, and also telling Mirabelle and Isabelle about many truths about the manor, Emilyko leaves without telling Kate and brings Belle‚Äôs letter to Barbie.
‚Ä¢ Barbie is surprised and reflective upon receiving this, remembering the past punishment that led to one of the Belle twins‚Äô deaths.
‚Ä¢ Emilyko had never revealed that she was the one who supported Belle privately during her grief, giving her a stuffed doll resembling her twin and comfort letters, but Barbie very much finds out and understands from the letter alone.
‚Ä¢ She had instinctively trusts Barbie, who‚Äôs been mentally strained from taking care of Barbara since ""Christopher"" returned.
‚Ä¢ Barbie lets Emilyko into Barbara‚Äôs room, a rare show of trust. Emilyko confronts her:
‚Ä¢ Asks, ‚ÄúWould you trust your friends or someone you haven‚Äôt seen in years?‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Promises to tell her everything if she chooses her friends.
‚Ä¢ Holds both Barbara and Barbie‚Äôs hands as she tells them:
‚Ä¢ Christopher is dead.
‚Ä¢ The current Christopher is Anthony‚Äôs puppet.
‚Ä¢ Anthony is manipulating them all.
‚Ä¢ Everything‚Äîfrom past suicides to manipulative systems‚Äîwas orchestrated by him.
‚Ä¢ All the pain‚ÄîMaryrose & Rosemary‚Äôs deaths, divisions between children‚Äîwas inadvertently caused by Anthony.
‚Ä¢ She believes Anthony's control is not absolute. He made problems, but they built the real connections. (Cheesy, ik)

4. Act IV: The Turning Point
‚Ä¢ Emilyko insists that Anthony only thinks he controls everything. She and Kate have earned trust, created unity, and built hope despite him.
‚Ä¢ Barbara and Barbie are shaken but listen.
‚Ä¢ Emilyko brings them to the star bearer meeting room, unaware the meeting hadn‚Äôt ended‚Äîjust paused.
‚Ä¢ Everyone is surprised by her sudden return with Barbara and Barbie.

5. Act V: Reunion & Realizations
‚Ä¢ The meeting included the star bearers, the former star bearers, the main crew, and the shadow Belle twins.
‚Ä¢ Since Emilyko, and by extension Barbara and Barbie, they reannouce that Susie is Shaun‚Äôs older sister, This was confirmed via memory recovery and family detail connections, triggering a soft emotional moment. And Emilyko excitedly says she suspected it all along:
‚ÄúYou guys feel alike! You‚Äôre both kind in that serious, thoughtful way‚Äîand you look SO alike!‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Emilyko, in her usual chaotic warmth, says if Susie and Shaun are siblings, then John and Susanna must be too (Shadow logic! Not how it works‚Äîbut the logic follows the Belle twins being shadow-siblings).
‚Ä¢ Susie is flustered and touched by Emilyko‚Äôs earnestness.

6. Act VI: Fate
‚Ä¢ After the meeting ends, Emilyko helps Kate prepare for bed and tells her what she told Barbara:
‚Ä¢ That Anthony is wrong.
‚Ä¢ That Kate didn't just react‚Äîshe built something real.
‚Ä¢ That their journey was full of fateful moments too specific to be chance.
‚Ä¢ Emilyko recaps how everything began:
‚Ä¢ She met Kate after arriving on soot Island while exploring, and couldn't get her out of her mind, making a doll of her, but the ring master sees it and tells her she met a ""face eating fairy""
‚Ä¢ After she failed after having so much on her mind including the ""girl with no face that might eat her face"" she met she got kicked out.
‚Ä¢ How being kicked out of the circus led her to cry on the street and beng found by her now best friends.
‚Ä¢ How Shaun, Lou, Ricky, and Rum found her and offered help.
‚Ä¢ How she met Kate again, and cleared things up, and found Kate a black cloak and received clothes in return (with Kate‚Äôs name stitched in), at first she refused cause of how high quality the clothes were, but Kate saw the doll Emilyko made of her, took and said the doll plus the cloak sounds like a fair trade to her.
‚Ä¢ Kate's clothing gave her her own clothing and name for the Selection when Shaun and the others told her she could go with them to the selection.
‚Ä¢ Due to the selecteds' names being given to the shadow once the mimicking is complete, Kate‚Äôs name circled back to Kate, and gave Emilyko her first real name in return, ""Emilyko"".
‚Ä¢ How every single event was built on choice and kindness, not manipulation.
‚Ä¢ Their connection began long before their entrance to the manor and shaped everything that followed.
‚Ä¢ She declares with full certainty:
‚ÄúIt's like we‚Äôre fated to take Great Grandfather down! Even if we have to go through Anthony first.‚Äù

7. Current Status
‚Ä¢ The Belle recovery mission is now organized with almost all major characters on Kate and Emilyko‚Äôs side.
‚Ä¢ Barbara and Barbie are likely aligned, if still processing.
‚Ä¢ Emilyko and Kate remain the central duo in a growing network of allies, continuing to act with strategy and heart.
‚Ä¢ Kate and Emilyko are working on spreading the antidote to the brainwashing coffee in secret with the help of others like Oliver, Douglas, and Evelyn.

Next arc Timeline Context
‚Ä¢ Kate and Emilyko now reside in the Star Bearers‚Äô leader room, and Barbara and Barbie moved into Kate and Emilyko's old room in the children's wing (to Emilyko‚Äôs recommendation) so they can have a clear view of the bridge connecting the two buildings.
‚Ä¢ Maryrose and Rosemary, long thought dead, have secretly survived and are hiding near yet far from the manor for the last half year, but now recently with Edward, Gerald, and Eileen (who were demoted and moved to where they were staying, in a abandoned remote village near the coal mines).

Current Story Arc
1. The Letter from Maryrose
‚Ä¢ A letter from Maryrose, addressed to Emilyko, is delivered to the children's wing.
‚Ä¢ Barbara is the one who receives it, not knowing Maryrose survived. This shocks her deeply, as she had witnessed their ‚Äúdeath‚Äù firsthand and was never given closure.
‚Ä¢ She spirals into stress and paranoia, thinking it might be a trap, especially since it's addressed to Emilyko‚Äîsomeone she now trusts deeply.
‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, Barbie is in the bathroom brushing her teeth and doesn‚Äôt immediately know what‚Äôs going on.
‚Ä¢ Soot builds up in the room due to Barbara's emotional distress, making Barbie quickly aware something is wrong when she comes out.
2. Barbie Reads the Letter
‚Ä¢ Barbie reads it after cleaning up and recognizing Rosemary‚Äôs handwriting.
‚Ä¢ Despite her past resentment toward Rosemary, memories of their past relationship and possible reasons for their sudden distance (like Christopher‚Äôs death) flood back.
‚Ä¢ She begins reflecting on the betrayal and hurt, realizing Maryrose and Rosemary might‚Äôve kept the truth from them out of guilt or fear, but it doesn't change the fact they kept it from them.
3. Emilyko‚Äôs Reaction & the Letter Back
‚Ä¢ Emilyko is overjoyed to learn her friends are alive and cries while clinging to Barbie.
‚Ä¢ She writes a long reply recounting everything that happened:
‚Ä¢ Gaining the children‚Äôs trust.
‚Ä¢ Finding out Rum and Shirley weren't ""disposed of"".
‚Ä¢ Helping many others, gaining them an amazing reputation.
‚Ä¢ Becoming Star Bearer leader through Barbara stepping down and letting everyone vote on whoever should become the next after having a heartfelt talk with Kate and Emilyko and finding out most don't trust her so it's for the better, and cause Barbara knew who the chlidren would vote for as the new leader.
‚Ä¢ Rescuing Louise and Lou after they got invited and almost unified.
‚Ä¢ Kate‚Äôs leadership and rising support from others.
‚Ä¢ Barbara and Barbie's redemption arc and growing trust.
‚Ä¢ Sarah and Mia‚Äôs falling out with them.
‚Ä¢ Antidotes being distributed to living dolls to restore memories.
‚Ä¢ Sarah‚Äôs current position in the adults' wing under Edward.
‚Ä¢ Ominous concerns for Sarah‚Äôs well-being.
‚Ä¢ Candy (a new debutant) is mentioned as a topic too big for this letter.
‚Ä¢ She ends the letter warmly, saying everyone misses them‚Äîeven if Barbie won‚Äôt admit it.
4. Maryrose & Rosemary‚Äôs Reaction
‚Ä¢ They initially panic when they see so much writing, thinking something terrible happened.
‚Ä¢ Their emotions swing between relief, pride, and deep worry.
‚Ä¢ Maryrose nearly yells ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl!‚Äù multiple times, only to be hushed by Rosemary to avoid alerting the Edward and his friends.
‚Ä¢ They learn from the letter that Kate may know why Sarah and Mia changed‚ÄîEmilyko suspects something but doesn‚Äôt know the full truth.
5. ‚ÄúMidnight Visit‚Äù Mishap
‚Ä¢ Wanting to see them again, Maryrose grabs Rosemary and uses the Phantom to sneak into the manor at night.
‚Ä¢ They first check Emilyko and Kate‚Äôs old room‚Äînow occupied by Barbara and Barbie‚Äîand realize too late that they've moved.
‚Ä¢ They sneak into the Star Bearers' building and peek into what they hope is Kate‚Äôs room‚Ä¶
6. Caught by Barbie
‚Ä¢ Barbie hears them outside and suddenly throws open the curtain, covered in soot and glaring.
‚Ä¢ Inside, the shadow -belle twins are sleeping in Kate‚Äôs bed with Emilyko sprawled over them (Kate is in the bathroom).
‚Ä¢ They‚Äôve been hiding to avoid being seen without their living doll, and had been staying there for a while.
‚Ä¢ Barbie lets them in but won‚Äôt let Maryrose and Rosemary get near much after letting them inside, standing guard to protect Emilyko and Barbara.
‚Ä¢ Rosemary almost speaks out bitterly, thinking Barbie hasn‚Äôt changed, but keeps it in‚Äîjust like she used to when enduring Barbie's harshness before their escape.
‚Ä¢ Tension is thick. Barbie doesn‚Äôt trust them yet, regardless of Emilyko‚Äôs heartfelt letter.
Key Themes & Emotional Threads
‚Ä¢ Barbie and Barbara‚Äôs trauma from betrayal, abandonment, and guilt.
‚Ä¢ Emilyko‚Äôs hopefulness and how her genuine warmth doesn‚Äôt erase past damage.
‚Ä¢ Maryrose and Rosemary‚Äôs guilt, desperate to reconnect but unsure how.
‚Ä¢ Strained relationships don‚Äôt magically heal with time or one letter.
‚Ä¢ Sarah and Mia‚Äôs defection, and Sarah‚Äôs unknown fate in the adults' wing, raise alarm.

1ldjq39,https://youtu.be/BfcE8akmjmQ,3 Very Scary TRUE Spring Break Horror Stories,"# ""Taken in Matamoros"":

I was supposed to be on that spring break trip in March 1989. My friends and I had been planning it for months, dreaming of South Padre Island‚Äôs sandy beaches and the wild nightlife across the border in Matamoros, Mexico. Mark Kilroy, my best friend since freshman year at the University of Texas, was the ringleader. Over burgers at our favorite diner, he leaned across the table, his eyes bright. ‚ÄúPicture it,‚Äù he said, waving a fry for emphasis. ‚ÄúSun all day, cold drinks at night, and bars packed with people. It‚Äôs gonna be the trip of a lifetime. You‚Äôre coming, right?‚ÄùI grinned and nodded. ‚ÄúCount me in.‚Äù Mark was like that‚Äîhis excitement pulled you in. He was a pre-med student, always studying, but spring break was his chance to let loose. Joining him were Bradley Moore, a laid-back guy who loved surfing; Bill Huddleston, the quiet one who always had our backs; and Brent Martin, the joker who could make anyone laugh. We were a tight group, ready for a week of memories.Two days before we were set to leave, my roommate tossed me a curveball. ‚ÄúSki trip in Colorado,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLast-minute spot opened up. You want it?‚Äù I hesitated. Skiing sounded amazing, but I‚Äôd promised Mark. I called him, feeling guilty. ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôm torn,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúThis ski thing came up.‚ÄùMark laughed. ‚ÄúGo shred the slopes,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll catch you next time. Just don‚Äôt break a leg.‚Äù I felt a pang but decided to take the ski trip. That choice saved my life, but it‚Äôs haunted me ever since.Mark, Bradley, Bill, and Brent headed to South Padre on March 10, 1989. They checked into the Sheraton, a bustling hotel with palm trees and a pool packed with college kids. Mark sent me a postcard, his messy handwriting joking about Bradley‚Äôs sunburn and Bill‚Äôs awful dance moves at the Miss Tanline contest on the beach. ‚ÄúMatamoros is wild,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBars are insane. Wish you were here!‚ÄùThey spent their days lounging on the sand, playing volleyball, and cheering at beach events. At night, they crossed the border into Matamoros, where bars like Sergeant Pepper‚Äôs, Los Sombreros, and the London Pub drew crowds with cheap beers and thumping music. The London Pub was their favorite‚Äîa cramped, neon-lit spot with sticky floors and a jukebox blaring pop hits. Mark loved it, always chatting up new people, his easy smile drawing them in.On March 14, around 2 a.m., they were at the London Pub. The place was a zoo‚Äîbodies pressed together, laughter mixing with the clink of glasses. Bradley called me the next day, his voice tight. ‚ÄúSomething bad happened,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMark‚Äôs gone.‚ÄùMy heart stopped. ‚ÄúGone? What do you mean, gone?‚Äù‚ÄúWe were at the bar,‚Äù Bradley said. ‚ÄúMark was talking to this girl from the Tanline contest‚Äîlong dark hair, real friendly. He said he was stepping outside for air. The place was so hot, we didn‚Äôt think twice. But he didn‚Äôt come back. Brent saw him outside, near the street. A gray truck pulled up, and two guys jumped out. They grabbed Mark, threw him in the back, and peeled out.‚ÄùI gripped the phone, my mouth dry. ‚ÄúYou saw it happen?‚Äù‚ÄúBrent did,‚Äù Bradley said. ‚ÄúHe ran out, yelling for us. We searched the street, the alleys, everywhere. Asked bartenders, bouncers, anyone. Nobody saw a thing. It was like he vanished.‚ÄùMy mind raced. Mark was careful, the guy who always made sure we got home safe. ‚ÄúWhat did the police say?‚Äù I asked.Bradley sighed. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt care. Said he‚Äôs probably drunk, sleeping it off somewhere. But I know what Brent saw. Those guys took him.‚ÄùThe group searched for hours, weaving through Matamoros‚Äôs crowded streets, calling Mark‚Äôs name. They crossed back to Brownsville, checking the hotel, the beach, even hospitals, thinking maybe he‚Äôd been hurt. Nothing. By morning, they filed a missing person report, but the Matamoros police brushed it off. ‚ÄúSpring breakers get lost all the time,‚Äù an officer said, barely looking up from his desk. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll turn up.‚ÄùI cut my ski trip short and flew back to Texas. My dorm room felt too quiet, the walls closing in. I called Bradley every day. ‚ÄúAnything?‚Äù I‚Äôd ask, dreading the answer.‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he‚Äôd say, his voice flatter each time. ‚ÄúHis parents are here now. They‚Äôre putting up flyers, talking to the news. The police still aren‚Äôt doing much.‚ÄùWeeks crawled by. I couldn‚Äôt focus on classes, my notes untouched. I kept picturing Mark‚Äîhis goofy laugh, the way he‚Äôd quiz me on biology to help me pass. I‚Äôd lie awake, heart pounding, imagining him lost, scared, or worse. My friends and I met up, trading theories over coffee. ‚ÄúMaybe he got mugged and wandered off,‚Äù Bill said, stirring his cup endlessly. Brent shook his head. ‚ÄúThose guys in the truck‚Äîthey targeted him. I saw their faces. They looked‚Ä¶ cold.‚ÄùOn April 1, my phone rang. It was Brent, his voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúThey found him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚ÄùI sank to the floor, the room spinning. ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I managed.‚ÄúCops raided a ranch,‚Äù Brent said. ‚ÄúRancho Santa Elena, outside Matamoros. They caught some drug runner, and he led them there. They found graves‚Äî13 of them. Mark was in one.‚ÄùI couldn‚Äôt breathe. ‚ÄúGraves? What happened to him?‚ÄùBrent‚Äôs voice broke. ‚ÄúIt was a cult. Drug smugglers, but they did‚Ä¶ rituals. They thought killing people kept their business safe. They grabbed Mark that night, took him to the ranch. They tortured him for hours‚Äîbeat him, cut him. Then they killed him with a machete. They buried him with the others.‚ÄùI felt sick, my hands shaking. Later, news reports filled in the details, each one a punch to the gut. The cult, led by a man named Adolfo Constanzo, called himself a high priest of Palo Mayombe, a twisted mix of Santeria, voodoo, and Aztec beliefs. Their ranch was a nightmare‚Äîrundown shacks, dirt floors stained with blood, altars cluttered with candles and bones. They‚Äôd kidnapped Mark outside the London Pub, spotting him alone in the dark. They drove him to the ranch, tied him up, and kept him alive for hours, tormenting him. They believed his death would protect their drug shipments. His body, mutilated, was tossed into a shallow grave with 12 others‚Äîmen, women, even a child, all victims of their rituals.I kept seeing Mark‚Äôs face, hearing his voice from that diner. ‚ÄúTrip of a lifetime,‚Äù he‚Äôd said. Now he was gone, stolen in seconds outside a crowded bar. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about that night. If I‚Äôd been there, would I have gone outside with him? Could I have fought those men off? Or would I be in a grave too?The story hit the news, headlines screaming about ‚Äúsatanic murders‚Äù and ‚Äúspring break horror.‚Äù Constanzo fled to Mexico City but died in a police shootout in May. Several cult members got 30 to 60 years in prison, but others slipped away, never caught. Mark‚Äôs parents held a memorial, their faces gray with grief. Bradley and Brent drifted apart, haunted by guilt for not stopping it. I felt it too, a weight that never lifted.I started speaking at colleges, telling Mark‚Äôs story to wide-eyed students planning their own spring breaks. ‚ÄúStay together,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, my voice steady but my hands shaking. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt walk off alone, especially at night. Watch your drink, know your surroundings, trust your gut.‚Äù I‚Äôd show them Mark‚Äôs picture‚Äî21, smiling, full of dreams. ‚ÄúHe wanted to be a doctor,‚Äù I‚Äôd tell them. ‚ÄúHe never got the chance.‚ÄùEvery March, I think of him. I see that postcard on my desk, his handwriting faded but clear. I wonder what he felt in those final hours, trapped in that awful place. Did he know how much we loved him? Did he fight? His death changed me. I don‚Äôt trust crowded places anymore, always checking exits, scanning faces. I hear a truck engine and freeze, picturing that gray pickup speeding away.Mark‚Äôs story is a warning, one I‚Äôll keep sharing. Spring break is supposed to be fun, but danger can hide anywhere‚Äîa busy bar, a dark street, a moment alone. I was lucky, but Mark wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll never forget him, and I‚Äôll never stop telling his story, hoping it keeps someone else safe.

  


# ""Trusting Strangers"":

I was beyond thrilled for my first spring break in Miami Beach. I‚Äôd been saving up for months, a sophomore from Ohio State, dreaming of palm trees, neon lights, and endless parties. Traveling alone felt bold, a chance to break free from my small-town life. I booked a room at the Albion Hotel, right in the heart of South Beach, where the Art Deco buildings glowed with pastel colors and the air pulsed with music. The lobby was all marble and mirrors, packed with college kids like me, laughing, snapping selfies, ready to live it up. I felt alive, like anything could happen.On my first afternoon, I wandered to the hotel pool, a sparkling rectangle surrounded by lounge chairs and cabanas. That‚Äôs where I met Christine. She was sprawled on a chair, reading The Beach by Alex Garland, her blonde hair tied in a messy bun. I was feeling a bit lonely, so I took a chance. ‚ÄúIs that book as wild as the movie?‚Äù I asked, pointing to her paperback. She looked up, her green eyes lighting up, and grinned. ‚ÄúWay crazier. You read it?‚Äù I shook my head, and we started talking. She was from Pennsylvania, also traveling solo, a year older than me. ‚ÄúI needed a break from my boring job,‚Äù she said, tossing her book aside. ‚ÄúThis place is like a fever dream.‚Äù We hit it off instantly, swapping stories about our hometowns and college drama. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs team up,‚Äù she suggested, adjusting her sunglasses. ‚ÄúTwo girls taking on Miami‚Äîwhat‚Äôs better than that?‚Äù I laughed, relieved to have a friend.For the next two days, we were inseparable. We strolled down Ocean Drive, where convertibles blared hip-hop and waiters called out happy hour deals. We grabbed tacos at a tiny stand, the kind with plastic chairs and spicy salsa that made us cough and laugh. At night, we hit smaller bars, sipping fruity drinks and dancing to reggaeton. Christine was fearless‚Äîshe‚Äôd talk to anyone, from street performers to random guys buying us drinks. I admired her confidence but noticed how she‚Äôd linger with strangers, laughing a little too long. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so outgoing,‚Äù I said once, half-joking. She shrugged, twirling a straw in her drink. ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs short. Gotta make it fun.‚Äù I brushed off my unease‚Äîshe was just living the moment, right?By the third night, we were ready for something bigger. We chose Mango‚Äôs Tropical Cafe, a massive club with salsa music so loud it vibrated in my chest. The place was a sensory overload‚Äîneon lights flashing pink and green, waitresses in feather costumes, dancers on platforms moving like they were born to it. We pushed through the sweaty crowd, finding a spot near the dance floor. Christine was in her element, swaying to the beat, her sundress catching the lights. I was having fun, but the crowd felt overwhelming, everyone packed so tight I could barely breathe.That‚Äôs when two guys approached us. One was tall, muscular, with dreadlocks and a tight black shirt that showed off his arms. The other was shorter, with a snake tattoo curling up his neck, his eyes sharp and unblinking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Evoire,‚Äù the first one said, his voice smooth, flashing a grin that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúThis is Dorian.‚Äù Christine smiled back, already chatting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Christine, and this is my friend,‚Äù she said, nudging me. I nodded, forcing a smile, but something felt off. Their eyes lingered too long, like they were sizing us up, not just flirting. Evoire leaned closer to Christine. ‚ÄúYou ladies need drinks?‚Äù She nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúSomething strong!‚Äù she said, laughing. They headed to the bar, and Dorian stayed near me, his cologne sharp and overpowering. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt dance?‚Äù he asked, his smirk making my skin prickle. ‚ÄúNot really my scene,‚Äù I mumbled, glancing at Christine. She was laughing with Evoire, her hand on his arm. I didn‚Äôt like it.At the bar, I watched Evoire hand her a bright blue drink. She sipped it, giggling, her movements looser. I felt a knot tighten in my stomach. Their smiles looked fake, their eyes darting around like they were scanning the room for something‚Äîor someone. I pulled Christine aside, my voice low. ‚ÄúThose guys seem‚Ä¶ off. You sure about this?‚Äù She rolled her eyes, playful but firm. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just having fun. Don‚Äôt be paranoid.‚Äù I wanted to push back, but the music drowned me out, and she was already back with them, dancing closer to Evoire. Dorian kept glancing at me, his stare cold, like he was daring me to say something.By midnight, I was exhausted, my head pounding from the noise and my gut screaming that something was wrong. I grabbed Christine‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading back to the hotel. Come with me, please.‚Äù She shook her head, her voice slurring slightly from the drinks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying. They‚Äôre taking me to another spot. I‚Äôll be fine, I promise.‚Äù Evoire was behind her, watching me, his smile gone. Dorian stepped closer, his tattoo gleaming under the lights. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good with us,‚Äù he said, his tone flat. My heart raced, but Christine waved me off. ‚ÄúText me later,‚Äù she called, already turning back to them. I stood there, frozen, then forced myself to leave, my legs heavy. I told myself she‚Äôd be okay‚Äîshe was smart, she‚Äôd text me soon.Back at the Albion, my room on the fourth floor felt too quiet. The neon glow from Ocean Drive seeped through my curtains, casting shadows on the walls. I checked my phone obsessively, waiting for Christine‚Äôs message. Nothing. By 1 a.m., I texted her: ‚ÄúYou okay? Where are you?‚Äù No reply. I called, but it went to voicemail, her cheerful voice saying, ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs Christine, leave a message!‚Äù My stomach churned. By 2 a.m., I was pacing, the bad feeling growing like a storm inside me. I tried to sleep, but every creak of the hotel made me jump. I kept seeing Evoire‚Äôs cold eyes, Dorian‚Äôs tattoo, the way they‚Äôd closed in on her like wolves.At dawn, sirens jolted me awake. I‚Äôd barely slept, my eyes gritty. From my window, I saw police cars parked outside, their red and blue lights flashing against the hotel‚Äôs white walls. My heart sank. I pulled on my shoes, my hands trembling, and ran to the elevator. The lobby was chaos‚Äîguests huddled in groups, whispering, cops moving with purpose. I overheard a woman say, ‚ÄúThey found a girl on the fourth floor‚Ä¶ dead.‚Äù My knees nearly buckled. Fourth floor. My floor.I pushed through the crowd, my pulse pounding in my ears. Outside the elevator, I saw a stretcher being wheeled down the hall. A white sheet covered a body, but a strand of blonde hair spilled out, catching the light. I stopped breathing. It was her. It had to be. A cop blocked my path, his hand raised. ‚ÄúMiss, you need to stay back,‚Äù he said, his voice calm but firm. ‚ÄúWhat happened? Who is it?‚Äù I asked, my voice breaking. He didn‚Äôt answer, just guided me to the lobby with the other guests.I sat on a couch, numb, as the whispers grew. ‚ÄúDrugged‚Ä¶ found in her room‚Ä¶ so young.‚Äù My phone buzzed with a news alert: ‚ÄúWoman, 24, found dead at Albion Hotel. Suspected foul play.‚Äù I felt sick, my hands shaking so hard I dropped my phone. A detective approached me later, his badge glinting. He was older, with tired eyes and a notepad. ‚ÄúYou knew Christine Englehardt?‚Äù he asked. I nodded, tears spilling over. ‚ÄúWhen did you last see her?‚Äù I told him everything‚ÄîMango‚Äôs, Evoire and Dorian, how I‚Äôd begged her to leave. He scribbled notes, his face unreadable. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at two men, Evoire Collier and Dorian Taylor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSeen with her last night. We found her in her room. Fentanyl overdose, and‚Ä¶ other injuries.‚Äù His voice softened. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt make it.‚ÄùI couldn‚Äôt speak. My mind replayed every moment‚Äîher laugh, her promise she‚Äôd be fine, the way I‚Äôd walked away. The detective asked more questions, but I barely heard them. Later, the news filled in the horrors: Evoire and Dorian had drugged Christine with fentanyl, assaulted her, and left her to die, her face pressed into the bed, unable to breathe. They‚Äôd stolen her credit cards, using them at shops down the street like it was nothing. The police found security footage of them leaving her room, laughing. I couldn‚Äôt stop picturing it‚ÄîChristine alone, helpless, while I was just down the hall, useless.I left Miami the next day, my spring break a nightmare. The hotel‚Äôs glitzy lobby, the crowded beaches, the pulsing music‚Äîit all felt like a lie, hiding something sinister. I kept replaying that night, wondering if I could‚Äôve stopped her, if I should‚Äôve grabbed her arm and dragged her back. Back in Ohio, I can‚Äôt sleep without seeing that blonde hair under the sheet, Evoire‚Äôs predatory grin, Dorian‚Äôs snake tattoo slithering in my nightmares. Spring break was supposed to be a story of fun, of freedom. Instead, it taught me a truth I‚Äôll never forget: danger hides in the brightest places, and sometimes, your gut is the only thing keeping you alive. I wish I‚Äôd listened to mine that night. I wish I‚Äôd saved her.

  


# ""Not Safe"":

I couldn‚Äôt wait for spring break. College had drained me‚Äîendless assignments, late-night study sessions, and the constant pressure to keep up. I needed an escape, somewhere far from campus. After scrolling online, I found a cheap hostel in a small coastal town in Oregon. The website showed a quaint, two-story house with ivy climbing the walls, just a short walk from the beach. It promised a cozy vibe, shared rooms, and a fire pit for evening hangouts. Perfect for a broke student like me. I booked a week, packed a duffel bag with clothes and a few books, and caught a bumpy bus ride to the coast, my excitement growing with every mile.When I arrived, the hostel was just as I‚Äôd imagined. The wooden floors creaked under my sneakers, and the air smelled faintly of cedar and salt. The manager, Carla, greeted me at the front desk. She was in her forties, with short blonde hair and a warm smile that made me feel welcome. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll love it here,‚Äù she said, handing me a key. ‚ÄúYour room‚Äôs upstairs, second door on the left.‚Äù She led me through a narrow hallway lined with faded beach photos and showed me to a small room with two bunk beds, a scratched wooden dresser, and a single window with a thin curtain. My roommate wasn‚Äôt there yet, so I claimed the bottom bunk, unzipped my bag, and neatly folded my clothes into the dresser. The room felt cozy, like a place where I could finally relax.That evening, I wandered to the backyard, where a group of guests sat around a crackling fire pit. The smell of burning wood filled the air, and someone passed me a soda. A guy named Jake, with curly brown hair and a loud, easy laugh, introduced himself. ‚ÄúFirst time here?‚Äù he asked, popping open his own soda. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, smiling. ‚ÄúNeeded a break from school.‚Äù He nodded. ‚ÄúThis place is great. The beach is just down the road. You‚Äôll have a blast.‚Äù His enthusiasm was contagious, and I felt my shoulders loosen for the first time in weeks.Then I noticed her. A woman sat across the fire pit, staring into the flames. She looked about my age, maybe twenty-two, with stringy brown hair that hung past her shoulders. Her pale skin seemed almost translucent in the firelight, and her hands fidgeted in her lap, twisting a woven bracelet over and over. She didn‚Äôt talk to anyone, didn‚Äôt even look up, but I felt her presence like a weight. Jake leaned over, his voice low. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Emily. She‚Äôs been here a couple of days. Keeps to herself.‚Äù I nodded, but her stillness unnerved me. Then her eyes flicked up and locked onto mine. They were wide, unblinking, like she could see right through me. My stomach twisted, and I quickly looked away, pretending to sip my soda. The chatter around the fire continued, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that she was still watching me.Back in the room that night, Emily was there. She sat cross-legged on the top bunk, staring at the wall, her hands still twisting that bracelet. The room was dim, lit only by a small lamp on the dresser. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said, trying to sound friendly as I kicked off my shoes. She didn‚Äôt respond at first, and the silence stretched, heavy and awkward. Then, in a low, raspy voice, she said, ‚ÄúYou should leave. It‚Äôs not safe here.‚Äù My heart skipped a beat. I stood frozen by the door, my hand still on the knob. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaky. She turned her head slowly, her wide eyes glinting in the lamplight. ‚ÄúJust leave,‚Äù she whispered, then climbed down the ladder with jerky movements and slipped out of the room. The door clicked shut behind her. I locked it, my hands trembling, and climbed into bed, pulling the thin blanket up to my chin. Her words echoed in my mind, sharp and cold. I lay awake for hours, listening for any sound, but the hostel was silent.The next morning, I dragged myself to the shared kitchen, still rattled. Emily was there, standing by the counter, stirring a cup of tea with a spoon that clinked against the mug. Her movements were slow, almost mechanical, and she was muttering under her breath, words I couldn‚Äôt make out. I grabbed a muffin from a basket and sat at the far end of the long wooden table, keeping my distance. Jake came in, wearing a bright red hoodie, and plopped down next to me. ‚ÄúYou look tired,‚Äù he said, grabbing an apple. I glanced at Emily, who hadn‚Äôt looked up from her tea. ‚ÄúMy roommate‚Äôs kind of‚Ä¶ strange,‚Äù I said quietly, peeling the wrapper off my muffin. Jake raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúEmily? Yeah, I heard her muttering in the hallway last night. Sounded like she was talking to someone, but no one was there.‚Äù My stomach churned. ‚ÄúShe told me it‚Äôs not safe here,‚Äù I admitted. Jake‚Äôs face grew serious. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. Maybe she‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, stressed? I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much.‚Äù But his words didn‚Äôt comfort me. I could still feel her eyes from the night before, boring into me.That night, I woke to a sound. Soft, deliberate footsteps paced outside my door, back and forth, back and forth. I lay still, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst. The pacing stopped, and then I heard it‚Äîa faint whisper, just outside the door. ‚ÄúNot safe‚Ä¶ not safe‚Ä¶‚Äù It was Emily‚Äôs voice, low and urgent. My skin prickled with fear. I wanted to get up, to check the lock, but my body wouldn‚Äôt move. I clutched the blanket, staring at the door, waiting for it to creak open. The whispering stopped, and the silence that followed was worse. I didn‚Äôt sleep again that night, my eyes glued to the door until the first light crept through the curtain.The next day, I avoided the hostel as much as I could. I spent hours at the beach, walking along the shore, trying to focus on the waves and the salty air. But Emily‚Äôs words clung to me like damp sand. When I got back, Jake was in the lounge, sprawled on a couch, scrolling on his phone. He looked up, his face tense. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúI saw Emily earlier. She was just standing in the hallway, staring at your door for, like, ten minutes. Didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù My throat tightened. ‚ÄúI heard her last night,‚Äù I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúShe was pacing outside my room, whispering that it‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù Jake‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs creepy. You need to tell Carla. That‚Äôs not normal.‚Äù I nodded, my hands clammy.I found Carla at the front desk, organizing a stack of brochures. ‚ÄúCan we talk in private?‚Äù I asked. She nodded, leading me to a small office behind the desk. I told her everything‚ÄîEmily‚Äôs warning, her muttering, the footsteps, the whispering outside my door. Carla‚Äôs smile faded, and she rubbed her forehead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had complaints about her before,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been acting strange since she arrived‚Äîtalking to herself, wandering the halls at odd hours. I thought she was just shy, but this is concerning. I‚Äôll talk to her today.‚Äù I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúCan I switch rooms?‚Äù I asked. Carla sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, but we‚Äôre fully booked for spring break. I‚Äôll keep an eye on her, I promise.‚Äù I left the office, my stomach in knots, feeling no safer than before.That evening, I stayed in the lounge with Jake and a few other guests, playing cards and trying to distract myself. The laughter around the table felt forced, and I kept glancing at the door, expecting Emily to walk in. Around midnight, I couldn‚Äôt avoid my room any longer. I walked down the dim hallway, the floorboards creaking under my feet. I opened the door slowly, my heart racing. Emily wasn‚Äôt there. Her bag sat on the floor, unzipped, with clothes spilling out‚Äîa tangled sweater, a pair Medieval literature books, and a cracked phone case. The sight of her things, abandoned like that, made my skin crawl. I locked the door, checked it twice, and climbed into bed, keeping the lamp on. I tried to read, but every creak in the house made me jump.Hours later, I woke to a new sound. Scratch. Scratch. Scratch. It was coming from the door, like fingernails dragging across the wood. My blood ran cold. I sat up, staring at the door, my breath shallow. The scratching stopped, then started again, slower, deliberate. Scratch. Scratch. I wanted to scream, but my voice caught in my throat. I grabbed my phone, my hands shaking, and texted Jake: ‚ÄúI hear scratching at my door. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù He replied instantly: ‚ÄúStay there. I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù Minutes later, I heard his footsteps in the hall. The scratching stopped. Jake knocked softly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me,‚Äù he whispered. I unlocked the door, and he slipped inside, his face pale. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see anyone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I heard it too, just before I got here.‚Äù We sat on my bunk, listening, but the hallway was silent. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night, and neither did Jake.The next morning, Emily was gone. Her bag was still there, its contents untouched, but she was nowhere in the hostel. I told Carla, and she checked the room, her face tight with worry. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt right,‚Äù she said, running a hand through her hair. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt check out. I need to call the police.‚Äù I waited in the lounge, my hands shaking, while Jake sat with me. ‚ÄúThis is so messed up,‚Äù he said, his voice low. ‚ÄúWhere could she have gone?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt answer. My mind kept replaying the scratching, the whispering, her wide, unblinking eyes.The police arrived within the hour. They asked me questions‚Äîwhat Emily looked like, what she said, how she acted. I told them everything, my voice trembling. One officer took Carla aside, and I overheard him say, ‚ÄúHer ID says her name‚Äôs Lisa, not Emily. She‚Äôs been missing for weeks. She has mental health issues and a history of wandering.‚Äù My heart stopped. Lisa? Missing? The room spun, and I gripped the arm of the couch. The officer continued, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take her belongings and try to track her down. She‚Äôs not dangerous, but she‚Äôs unstable.‚Äù Not dangerous? I didn‚Äôt believe it. Not after the scratching, the pacing, the whispers.Carla apologized over and over, her face pale. ‚ÄúI should have acted sooner,‚Äù she said, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúI thought she was just eccentric.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt blame her, but I couldn‚Äôt stay. I packed my bag, my hands still shaking, and caught the next bus home. As the bus pulled away, I stared out the window at the hostel, its ivy-covered walls no longer charming. My spring break was supposed to be a fun escape, but all I felt was fear, cold and heavy in my chest. I can still hear her voice, low and urgent, whispering, ‚ÄúNot safe‚Ä¶ not safe‚Ä¶‚Äù I don‚Äôt know where Lisa went, or why she was there, but I hope I never cross her path again.",1,1750156480.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1ldjngj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ldjngj,The Marble Arch Hike,"Welcome to Marble Arch. An incredible natural feature in Deua National Park, Australia.

From campground to the arch, it's about six kilometers (although feels a lot longer). The terrain is mostly undulating, you will get wet boots almost immediately with a creek crossing. Along the way there are two steep descents that test the strength of your knees.

You're hiking through wild country. The nearest town is about 50 kilometers away although some farms are reasonably nearby. But for the most part it is pristine, untouched native bushland straddling the Great Dividing Range.

Eventually you will reach a very steep descent that drops about 500 meters down. Your legs will hate you. But soon enough you have reached your reward - Marble Arch.

The scene is a small valley surrounded with towering tree-covered hillsides. A small mostly seasonal creek flows directly into a rocky ridge, that ridge is made of marble.
After thousands and thousands of years the water of that small creek cut right though that ridge to join a larger waterway network further downstream. It's remarkable to see.

You have to get your boots wet again and scramble along the creek and into the arch itself. Basically it's a tunnel made of marble. The light fades significantly the deeper you go, so a torch is essential.

Many people stop there, take some pictures, and then head back. But......
If you keep scrambling through the tunnel (it does lower in height so keep low), soon you are through the other side and inside a narrow canyon.

The canyon is solid rock again carved out by the power of water. More scramling (and slipping!), and fifty meters later you are greeted with an incredible sight.

A waterfall appears on the right side of the canyon wall, the water is coming out from underground! Here is your reward.

At this amazing scene it's not possible to go any further. From the waterfall it's a steep drop into deep water with towering canyon walls on either side.

I would love to go further, but more equipment is needed. 

But that's ok. There is a nice little spot beside the waterfall to make some coffee and have your lunch. A boulder sits beside the waterfall, a perfect spot to sit and meditate.

This is my favorite place.

I was there for 5 or so hours, and even though I still had 2, I was still very proud of me.  Old me would have had WAY more. I came home, didn't want to drink anymore even though I had some in the house.  This was days ago and since, I haven't wanted to drink anything, and was actually looking forward to an ice cold fizzy seltzer as I made dinner last night. Did I fail? Maybe. But was I also proud of myself for not getting right back in it as I had in the past? You bet. I even said to myself, the feeling of being well rested, getting up with the birds and enjoying a coffee is way better than drinking (way too much) in an attempt to relax. And I just keep saying that to myself evening after evening. ",5,1750156048.0,stopdrinking,2,0.86,False
