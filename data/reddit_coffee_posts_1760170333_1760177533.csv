1o3qtlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1o3qtlv/am_i_doing_too_much_in_my_relationship/,Am I doing too much in my relationship?,"This is a long one. I need some outside perspective, because this is a big rollercoaster for me.

I am in the first long-lasting relationship in my life: we‚Äôre both mid 20s, been together for 3 years and living together for almost 2.
I met my partner when I was planning on moving abroad, he supported me with everything and once I more or less set up my life in this country, he joined me and we moved in together. He has a good career, he found a nice job here while I started my study program.
We had some hurdles but we got through everything, if you ask me.

Now there are multiple reasons that lead me to considering if I‚Äôm doing too much/not enough/how to balance it so that I also don‚Äôt live with constant weight on my shoulders.
 - He doesn‚Äôt speak the local language, so 95% of our administrative to-dos fall on me, as I am almost fluent in it and the administrators don‚Äôt tend to speak English well enough to get things done. I knew this would be something I‚Äôd have to deal with, but even when we‚Äôre just researching the topics we need to deal with, I have to specifically ask him to pull his weight.
 - Unfortunately, we spent the better part of this past year with him having health issues, needing multiple tests. We know now that it‚Äôs nothing serious but he was struggling a lot and I needed to pull more weight in the household to keep us running + I was trying to offer as much emotional support as possible. All of this during a time when I was ~ 35hrs/week at uni, because I had such a busy schedule and multiple important exams coming up.
 - By now the health issues got better, but work stress took over. It‚Äôs basically the same, he‚Äôs so stressed and exhausted by the end of the workday that he‚Äôs just rotting on the couch and has either no or bad energy. We can watch series or movies together but that‚Äôs all that he has capacity for. I miss having conversations with him. I believe that he‚Äôs not doing it on purpose and he still takes care of me in many aspects daily, like bringing coffee for me in the morning, doing the dishes constantly, which I really love and appreciate.

On the other hand, I am the one who has to think about cooking, laundry (if I don‚Äôt get the clothes off the drying rack, they stay there until we have a new load to wash and there‚Äôs not enough space anymore‚Ä¶), once again, administrative duties and emotional support plus my own things. It wasn‚Äôt always like that, we have better and worse periods of course but recently the worse was more typical and I‚Äôm not sure how to pull through or how to set boundaries.

I‚Äôm not the type of person who is content with homemaking being their Nr.1 duty, yet I always have enough things to do around the house to fill out multiple days.

With moving abroad, I pivoted to a creative career where I have to be very proactive if I want to get ahead and with all of the emotional burden and organizational ‚Äúbrain-work‚Äù that relies on me, I just don‚Äôt have the capacity to create most of the times. It makes me very sad, I am getting more and more frustrated and am unsure how to start a discussion about this. I want to be supportive and step up when my partner needs me, but somehow still be able to live my life.

I don‚Äôt want to kick my partner when he‚Äôs down but I need him to figure out his shit asap.
I feel like my life is becoming the exact old-timey stereotype that I worked so hard to escape and I want to save this relationship before we commit to something more serious.

1o3qs2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dutchbros/comments/1o3qs2y/espresso_cold_brew_sorry_im_new/,"Espresso, cold brew? Sorry I'm new.","Hey all, so I just visited dutch bros for the first time 2 days ago and IMMEDIATELY, I'm in love. I tried the golden eagle freeze because it sounded good and I'm a frap kinda girlie  so why not? O.M. it. is. GOOD. I immediately went on a deep dive here and on other websites even t.Tok to see if I could make it at home and saw some opposing info. Some sources say it's a cold brew + milk + sugar recipe thats premade and some say it's made with espresso shots. So I'm just trying to figure out if there's anyway to make the freeze at home. I also searched (if it turns out that cold brew is the right answer) online if they sold their cold brew, but it turns out that its only sold at certain locations in-house. Which is kinda disappointing since I live about 20 min from the nearest one and don't drive so, sigh. But I did see that they sell their own coffee blend online. Now here's my findings. Their bean blend says it has Columbian coffee beans in it, I find this to be true and confirm it (based off my own taste buds) because my initial impressions were how it reminded me of the brand 'tuekey hill' ice cream's 'columbian coffee's flavor and this was before I even did the deep-dive. After looking up dupe recipes and seeing the 'iced latte's version, I tried some 'columbian' instant coffee from the brand 'N.' who shall not be named. We all should know by now. And when I followed the latte instructions on t.Tok it did taste like a ghost of the actual freeze. I had a sliver of accomplishment in that moment however it was short-lived because now I felt closer, yet still so far away.

So my question is this: If my local store doesn't sell their cold brew concentrate in-house, can I use the dutch-bros bean blend to make my homemade cold brew, mix with flavorings (torani syrup and sauce) and blend to make a freeze at home? Or am I doomed to my new flavorful, smooth icey coffee experience?

 I mean seriously I never thought I'd find something that pulls me away from the siren since I've been on it since I was a kid. But dutch bros takes the cake!

 Thanks so much!

My ex and I met at a queer event and dated for a few months in middle school. We were the only openly gay couple in school. He was constantly wanting attention, validation, expensive (for 15 yo me at least) dates, sex and long chats over Skype. I definitely had a lot of romantic attraction when we started. But due to his behaviour, I eventually fell out of love and he didn't talk to me for years after I broke up. Our moms were good friends, so we would still hear about each other on occasion.  

A few years ago, we reconnected on insta. At the time we were both in other relationships and we fell into a pattern of sporadically texting each other with ""happy holiday"" type messages. His relationship status changed around often, I've been steady with my partner. We met up and had coffee once when I was visiting our home town. 

He is a bit of a mess. He dropped out of multiple programs for education and training and still needs his mother to pay for his rent. He was struggling with severe depression on and off over the past few years. I keep him at a distance emotionally - but the reverse is not true. He's been clingy, demanding that I talk hyper-politically correct, going on long rants how he hates how I speak to him, that I give advice instead of validating his feelings... 

Frankly, he is completely intolerant to any and all self reflection or even just discomfort. If something is uncomfortable, it turns into a huge wall of text in my inbox. He wants me to validate every decision, every word and every feeling which I just straight up refuse to do. 



**Example from last year:** 

I was describing that I was in the hospital for a severe infection and had limited capacity to deal with his emotional problems. I mentioned that I was trying to not lose my job. He went on a rant about how he was worried for me because his dad was a workaholic. I explained that I'm doing my best to stay employed, but also that I was taking care of myself. 

His response was a long rant that he expected me to show him sympathy for how hard it was that he has a shitty dad. I told him that it was his pejorative to compare me to his shitty dad when I'm scared in the hospital that I might be losing my arm. He was pouting and told me that I can't call his dad shitty because that hurts his feelings. I said sorry for that and forced the end of that conversation. 



**Today:** 

We were talking about his new internship and I was hyping him up. But then he suddenly wrote a long text about how awful and loud his neighbours are. i suggested buying noise cancelling headphones, based on my own advice for living around party animals. 

He sent me a 300 word text about how I need to stop telling him advice, need to sympathise with him for his feelings (and am not allowed to challenge them)... he is angry at me for invalidating him and his feelings. And of course, he should not have to experience any discomfort whatsoever. 



I am entirely fed up with him. I wrote back that I am not going to humor him and should find someone else to bitch to. He replied with another 300 word text, trying to analyse every word I wrote and of course that I hurt his feelings. I muted him and my finger is on the block button. 

In the example from last year, I told my partner that I wanted to block this guy. He knows that I struggle with making friends, so he suggested that I am being a little rash to my ex if I just block and forget about him. The guy does not have much of a social life and he is clearly mentally ill. It has at least made me pause to consider my approach. Am I being unreasonable and insensitive to this guy? How would I even respond? He's my ex! He's my ex because he has the social and emotional maturity of a 14 year old! But then again, he has the emotional maturity of a 14 year old. I am not sure if he even understands why I am annoyed. 

Do I try, yet again, to explain to him what the issue is? Do I explain that I am done and then block him? Or do I ghost, block and move on?",3,1760172467.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

In S01E01 two schoolgirls talk about ‚ÄúDo you want to go to Mitsugoshi after school?‚Äù Apparently a store or chain in Minoru‚Äôs Japan. He doesn‚Äôt make the connection in Midgar? Like being isekaied & seeing a store named ‚ÄúMacy‚Äôs‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarrods‚Äù & not even thinking, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird‚Ä¶‚Äù Clue #1. 

Clue #2 Window displays of Western clothing 

Clue #3 the ginormous statue of the Seven Shadows with each clearly identifiable he walks past on entry. 

Clue #4 walking past displays of chocolate, coffee, cosmetics not ever seen in Midgar before.

Clue #5 the ginormous statue of the Seven Shadows with each clearly identifiable he walks past on entry. This one merits mentioning twice. He must walk past & around a magnificent 2-story statue of his closest friends & pupils & it doesn‚Äôt register. 

Yet he‚Äôs shocked to see Gamma. Only then does he remember, ‚ÄúOh, yeah, I described all these things to the girls.‚Äù

Last dumb thing of the scene - he uses slime to steal a single coin when he could have had them all just for asking.

By our social media efforts alone we have a community strength that would typically equate to a valuation in the billions, but Kendu goes a step further than that with IRL efforts.

On a side note: Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, the only other coin to manage this was Pepe!!! Here is a link to the Certik audit: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu

Anyways back to the IRL efforts, we have over 20 community led initiatives from a street team(KenduSTREET) to a coffee business to a merch business and many others. Since these are community led so many will be waiting for higher levels to release their initiative since they will have more money to play with, the Kendu wave will only grow. IRL efforts are gonna be so important and decisive for retail investment because it shows Proof of Humanity that the community is actually real people with real investments. It also helps bridge crypto to the real world.

Kendu is self growing, many of these businesses like Kendu Video Games are making a treasury which will buy Kendu from a portion of the profits that they will make from the initiative, this is gonna keep Kendu's price stable and will help us push for the higher levels.

Kendu is arguably the best investment rn, at 15 million market cap there is so much room for growth compared to projects already in the hundreds of millions or even the billions.

This is just the start, remember people didn't make life changing money buying SHIB at 30 billion, to access a life of luxury you will have to buy the next Shib or the next Doge or the next Pepe, at the lower levels under 100 million mc...

Just food for thought, do your research and have a think!

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Have you noticed how quickly everything is changing in the job market? Like, if you blink, you might miss that cool new AI tool that just dropped. **It‚Äôs wild out there!** ü§Ø Honestly, it feels like we‚Äôre living in a sci-fi movie where robots are suddenly doing half the work (and doing it well!).

But here‚Äôs the kicker: it's not just about watching from the sidelines anymore. **We need to be in the game**! If we want to keep our careers thriving, we gotta reskill NOW for this AI-powered workforce. So grab your coffee, and let‚Äôs chat about why you should jump on this train before it leaves the station. üöÇ

**Why reskill?** Here are some thought starters:

- **Everything‚Äôs getting AI-fied:** From chatbots to data crunchers, AI is coming for your job‚Ä¶ but let‚Äôs flip that narrative! How can you leverage AI to work smarter, not harder? Trust me, integrating AI tools can make your life sooo much easier! 

- **Your current skills might be redundant soon:** Remember when people said ‚ÄúBe a travel agent!‚Äù? Well, yeah, now we have apps for that. üì≤ The same thing could happen to your job if you're not keeping up. 

- **Future-proofing your career:** Imagine being the go-to person in your field because you adapted early to AI trends. Scoring yourself a promotion or a sweet new job doesn‚Äôt sound too shabby, right?

- **It‚Äôs a chance for growth:** Reskilling isn‚Äôt about replacing your current skills; it‚Äôs about expanding them. Think of it this way: you‚Äôre not just adding a tool to your belt; you‚Äôre upgrading the whole toolkit! üîß

And just to make this journey a bit smoother, there are resources out there! For example, I stumbled upon this educational program that‚Äôs great for folks like us looking to delve into AI: https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals. It‚Äôs hands-on and can help boost your skill set without feeling overwhelming.

Plus, if you‚Äôre worried about jumping into the unknown, you‚Äôre definitely not alone! Even the most seasoned pros are scratching their heads over how to adapt. It's like we've entered the land of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the latest AI thing?‚Äù but in a friendly ‚Äòlet's figure this out together‚Äô vibe. ü§ó

So, what are your thoughts? Have you started reskilling yet? Any tools or resources that you‚Äôve found particularly helpful? We‚Äôre all in this together, friend! Let‚Äôs keep the convo going, whether you‚Äôre a newbie or a seasoned vet in the AI game. üó£Ô∏è‚ú®

1o3qafo,https://www.reddit.com/r/algeria/comments/1o3qafo/a_few_things_to_keep_in_mind_as_young_people/,A Few Things to Keep in Mind as Young People," I want to start by saying there are no inherently ""right"" decisions, only choices that lead to various outcomes. Your job isn't to find the perfectpath butt to manage the consequences of the path you choose.

You should strive to follow your passions, even if it means accepting a lower salary or a less-than-perfect lifestyle. Don't feel pressured to chase a cookie-cutter image of success with the fancy house and the prescribed family structure. True fulfillment comes from pursuing what you love.

My most practical advice is to save your money. Cutting out small, daily expenses like expensive coffee and skipping those spur-of-the-moment purchases driven by sales will benefit you immensely over time. 

When it comes to love and relationships, cherish them while they last, as nothing is guaranteed forever. A successful partnership demands consistent effort and compromise. You won't always be correct, and there will be times when you feel disconnected. The strength of a relationship rests on the small, thoughtful gestures, like bringing home a favorite treat or helping with mundane chores, not on huge, sweeping demonstrations. These daily acts of consideration are what sustain a lasting bond.

Time itself is strange... it can fly by in a blink or drag painfully slowly. Don't let yourself get lost in unfulfilling corporate work or endless routines, which can make life disappear. Instead, pursue what brings you joy every single day.
Don't fixate on the clock. While time can be lost, it also grants you wisdom, valuable experiences, and moments with those you care about. The scars you collect are proof that you've lived fully.
Finally, seek joy actively and learn to worry less. Life will unfold regardless of your anxiety or planning. Prepare for hard times when you can, but make sure you fully embrace and hold onto every good moment.

maybe stress, anxiety i was dealing with caused me to mess up my sleep schedule. i was having nightmares. i‚Äôm doing okay ish now but my sleep is fucked. i usually have very sensitive sleeping patterns, like it can be messed with easily. 

for a lot of reasons my body/mind/whatever remains in alert mode even when i‚Äôm asleep. 

also if i fall asleep too early (like 10:30 pm) i will wake up and be fully awake at 2am. then get tired around 6-7 am. terrible cycle. 

i can‚Äôt really ever get back to sleep, that‚Äôs been a thing for me my whole life. once i‚Äôm up, i‚Äôm up and i can‚Äôt just fall back asleep and if i try i‚Äôll just be laying there for hours. sometimes hypnosis or meditation helps but i have to already be really tired. 

i‚Äôm very envious of people like my boyfriend who can just wake up and then fall back asleep. like literally especially if i‚Äôm stressed i‚Äôll sleep for two hours in a 20 hour period, wake up to a noise and just have to be awake even though i‚Äôve gotten no sleep. 

also i can stay up like seriously forever. no matter how tired i am. i could have been up since 2am the previous day and now it‚Äôs 2am the next day and i‚Äôm absolutely exhausted but i can just stay awake. (it‚Äôs kinda frustrating when people just can‚Äôt stay up and fall asleep super early on a weekend or something when we‚Äôre tryna hang out cause i‚Äôm like .. just stay up? you can‚Äôt do that?) (i‚Äôm not actually mad about that but it‚Äôs just something i know it‚Äôs silly and unfair to judge people on, people need their sleep) 

but anyways it‚Äôs 4am now. i‚Äôve been awake since 2. i decided at 3 to just get up, make coffee and eggs and now i‚Äôm gonna clean the kitchen. 

im gonna be awake anyways so either lay in bed for hours or do something productive. also i was hungry. 

anyways it‚Äôs always been like this, i‚Äôm always dealing with some sort of sleep issue. sooo that‚Äôs all bye. ",3,1760171237.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

It should be a painting of her and her husband dancing. The problem is I only have a very blurry screenshot of the video she sent me, and I cannot play the video to choose another scene. So I kind of need the husband to be a bit more visible, you can move him a bit, or I can send the photo of his face so his face can also be a bit more visible. She's also wearing round glasses that are almost impossible to see here. I would also like the background to just resemble this one, just wooden wall, glass windows of the coffee shop and the colorful lights above. Maybe siluete of a cat somewhere in the corner like an Easter egg, but with all the other things I have requested it is really not necessary. üòÅ
So In summary, I need this to be a bit more sharp, husband more visible, background simplified and all turned into a painting. Paid 5-10$ through PayPal or western union if you're in Europe, payment will be slow, as I need to make an account but it will be received.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I usually add 200 ml of hot milk to the coffee per person.

I use 20 g of ground coffee (rougher grind than espresso, I grind espresso at level 1 and this one at level 2), and heat on an induction stove (level 6 out of 10). Using the distributor tool, but not tamping at all.

However, it seems I am not getting enough output for 2 x 200 ml = 400 ml of milk, so I basically have to make two moka pots in a row, which gets tricky as the pot is hot after the first portion.

Did I make a mistake and should I have gone 6-cup?

I also watched a video with Mr. Hoffmann about the proper workflow, and there he is watching the coffee come out and stops when it starts spurting rapidly. But that means I have to basically watch the moka pot brewing and keep the lid open, and also I'm only getting about 35 g of output. What am I missing?

I fill it up with hot water to the lower part of the safety valve.

1o3q24s,https://i.redd.it/ffnx14a9yfuf1.jpeg,Haunting Whisper of the Echo house,"The Echo in the Walls It started with a whisper. Not the kind that rustles leaves or tickles your ear in a crowded room, but something deeper, like the house itself was exhaling secrets it had swallowed whole.My name is Elias, and I bought the old Victorian on Elm Street because it was cheap. Too cheap, the realtor had said with a nervous laugh, but who listens to that? The place had good bones‚Äîcreaky oak floors, stained glass windows that bled rainbows at dawn, and a attic that promised forgotten treasures. I was a writer, starving for inspiration, and this was my blank page.The first night, I unpacked in the living room, the air thick with dust and the faint scent of mildew. As I hammered a nail into the wall for a shelf, something shifted behind the plaster. A soft thump, like a pebble dropping into a well. I froze, hammer mid-air. The house settled, I told myself. Old houses groan like old men.But then it came: a whisper. Faint, garbled, as if spoken underwater. ""...home... finally... home..."" I pressed my ear to the wall. Nothing. Just the hum of the fridge in the kitchen. I laughed it off, finished the shelf, and went to bed.Sleep was fitful. Dreams of walls breathing, of fingers scraping from the inside out. I woke to sunlight slicing through the curtains, the room golden and ordinary. Coffee helped. Work helped. By noon, I'd written three pages‚Äîmy best in months. The house was magic, I decided. A muse in mortar.That evening, as shadows pooled in the corners, it happened again. I was in the study, typing furiously, when the whisper slithered from the baseboard. ""...Elias... wait... I've waited..."" My name. It knew my name. Heart pounding, I yanked the outlet cover free, peering into the dark cavity. Cobwebs and wiring, nothing more. But the air felt... watched.I called my sister, Lena, that night. ""It's just the wind,"" she said, her voice tinny over the line. ""Or mice. Get a cat."" Practical Lena. But as I hung up, the whisper returned, clearer now, from the ceiling above the phone. ""...sister... no... mine..."" I dropped the receiver, the dial tone a scream in the silence.By morning, I was rationalizing. Carbon monoxide? Faulty wiring hallucinating sounds? I scoured the internet for ""haunted houses scientific explanations,"" but the forums only fed the fear. One post caught my eye: The Echo House. Built 1892. They say the walls remember. A grainy photo matched my facade. Comments below: Stay out. It takes what it wants. My uncle lived there. Never left.I laughed‚Äînerves, surely‚Äîbut my hands shook as I nailed shut the attic hatch. No more whispers from up there. That night, I barricaded the bedroom door with a dresser, slept with the lights on. The bulb flickered once, twice, then died. In the dark, the walls sighed. ""...light... hurts... come closer...""I didn't sleep. Dawn brought resolve. I'd tear it down, board by board. But first, breakfast. In the kitchen, as I poured cereal, a shadow flitted across the window‚Äîno tree, no bird. Then, from the pantry door, ajar by an inch: ""...hungry... feed me...""I slammed it shut, the wood splintering under my palm. Something soft pressed back from the other side. A hand? No‚Äîfingers, too many, splaying like roots. I stumbled back, knocking over the bowl. Milk spiderwebbed across the floor, and in its reflection, I saw it: my face, but wrong. Eyes too wide, mouth stretched in a grin that wasn't mine.The whispers multiplied then, a chorus from every surface. Floors, ceiling, the very air. ""...join us... echo... forever..."" I ran to the front door, but the knob turned slick with something warm‚Äîblood? My blood? No, it was sweat, panic's oil. Outside, the world was gray, the street empty. Neighbors' houses stared back, blind and silent.I drove to Lena's, pounding on her door until she answered, bleary-eyed. ""Elias? What's wrong?""""It's the house,"" I gasped. ""It knows me. It wants‚Äî""She pulled me inside, brewed tea. ""You're stressed. Take a breath."" But as I sipped, a faint murmur rose from the floorboards beneath the table. ""...sister... mine now...""Lena frowned. ""What was that?""""Nothing,"" I lied, but her eyes sharpened. She excused herself to the bathroom, and I heard it‚Äîclear as a bell‚Äîfrom the pipes. ""...come back... Elias... home...""When she returned, her smile was off, too tight. ""You should stay here tonight. Rest.""I nodded, relief flooding me. But as we sat on her couch, the TV droning some sitcom laugh track, a whisper curled from the wall behind her. ""...welcome... family...""Lena tilted her head, listening. ""Do you hear that? Like... rain?""No rain. Just the house. Not my house‚Äîthe house. It had followed me. Or had I brought it? In her eyes, I saw the flicker: wide, waiting.That night, on her guest bed, the sheets felt like skin. The whispers were a lullaby now, soft and insistent. ""...sleep... dream... become...""I woke to emptiness. Lena's room was silent, her bed made. A note on the kitchen counter: Gone to check on your place. Be back soon. Love, L.I followed, driving like a man possessed, the road blurring. Elm Street loomed, windows glowing faintly in the midday sun. The door hung open, inviting.Inside, the air hummed. Footsteps echoed from upstairs‚Äînot mine. ""Lena?"" My voice cracked.From the attic: ""...up here... Elias... we've been waiting...""I climbed, each step a betrayal, the nails I'd hammered now loose, wood parting like flesh. The hatch yawned, and there she was‚ÄîLena, kneeling in the dust, ear pressed to the beams. Smiling that wrong smile.""Join us,"" she said, not looking up. Her voice layered, doubled. ""...echo...""The walls pulsed. Whispers became roars: names, faces, lives swallowed whole. I backed away, but the floorboards grabbed‚Äîsplinters like teeth. Hands from the plaster, pulling, folding me in.Now, I whisper too. From the walls. Waiting for the next one. The house breathes easy. Home, finally. Home.

We were chatting when this man walks by; slicked back hair, tan, nice clothes, linen shirt slightly buttoned. Short and bit pudgy but honestly he was well-groomed and wealthy looking.

As soon we come into his line of vision he shouts, ‚ÄúLESBIANS, fucking LESBIANS.‚Äù I was shocked mute but my friend just responded with, ‚Äúyeah, for you.‚Äù  He kept walking but finished with, ‚Äúevery lesbian needs a good cock!‚Äù

We laughed it off and got back to bitching but honestly I was a bit cut. I get my sexuality questioned often. I don‚Äôt think it should be inherently insulting to be considered gay but I know most people aren‚Äôt asking from a point of being inclusive. It just makes me insecure because my assumption is that I look masculine/ugly bc of the cultural stereotypes. And then I feel bad for reinforcing a negative connotation by being slightly offended. I love and admire lesbians but unless they‚Äôre really butch I can‚Äôt clock them.

What makes a girl give off that vibe? Honestly.",12,1760170361.0,rs_x,13,0.88,False
