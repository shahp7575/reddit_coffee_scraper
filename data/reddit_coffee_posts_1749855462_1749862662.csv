1law2gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/storytimesociety/comments/1law2gw/aita_for_telling_my_friend_the_reason_why_she/,AITA for telling my friend the reason why she doesn't have other friends?,"Me and my friend — let's call her Nina — met at college. We lived in the same dorm and quickly hit it off. We have very similar interests and experiences we bonded over, and now I consider her one of my closest friends. We never had any issue or major fight besides this. Our personalities are very different. I'm more extroverted and she's more introverted, and there's nothing wrong with that. All my close friends are introverts, so that's not the issue for me.

The issue is that she put her entire social life onto my shoulders. She only talks to the people I'm talking to, and only when I'm around. She never initiates conversations with them or anyone else — always someone else has to start a conversation. I invited her to our hangouts, study sessions, coffee dates, etc., but she always rejects it because it's usually on the weekends. I'm also the one who plans and organizes all our plans. Like, I'm the one planning the date, the activity — the only thing she has to do is decide whether what I'm planning is good enough or confirm the date.

I understand that people click differently with others and that some people don't need a lot of friends. But she wants the opposite. She often expresses to me that she wants a social life, that she wants to have friends to go to the movies with and stuff. She often says how jealous she is of people like me who have a rich social life and lots of friends, and that she wishes to be like me. We used to talk a lot about this topic. I tried to hint at the reasons below, but the message never got through.

Last week she visited me at my home. Since exam season is finally over, we wanted to use the time to spend together. Everything was fine until one night, in the middle of a heart-to-heart conversation, she asked me if there was something wrong with her for not having many friends.

This time, I decided to be completely honest. I asked her, “Can I tell you the truth?” and she said, “Go ahead.” I told her that I’ve noticed she tends to stay in a lot, and sometimes even skip class, which might make it harder for people to get to know her. That it seems like she usually waits for others to start conversations, and maybe that gives the impression she’s not interested — even if she actually is. That she’s not really the one to initiate plans or reach out, and while that’s totally okay, it might make it harder to build closer connections with people. That sometimes she backs out of plans pretty quickly, and maybe that makes others unsure if she wants to be included or not. That she often can’t make it to our hangouts, especially on weekends, and that’s totally valid — but it also means less time for people to get to know her better.

I reassured her that there's nothing wrong with her — she just needs to put a little bit more effort into making friends. I suggested she join different clubs or go to events where she can meet new people. I offered to accompany her if it brings her comfort. I also mentioned that she could join one of our study sessions or coffee dates.

She was silent for a long time, then said, “There’s no social event or club I’m interested in,” and that “She can’t participate in any of our weekly hangouts because they’re always on the weekends and she goes home on Friday,” and that “I’m an extrovert so I’ll never understand how hard it is to make friends as an introvert since I never had to deal with the problem.”

After this, we just dropped the subject and talked about other stuff, then went to bed. She went home the next day. Since then she’s been kinda passive-aggressive and making comments whenever we have a conversation. Like if I text her “Heyy how you doin?” she replies with “I’m in my room not going anywhere as I always do.”

I tried to talk to my parents about it, and my mom said I clearly hurt her and I should apologize, but my dad said I did nothing wrong and she will calm down",1,1749862519.0,storytimesociety,0,1.0,False

She and I have been talking for a couple of weeks. Things are going well between us and today I decided to elevate our conversation by asking her for a coffee, but as I came in this morning and said good morning, she didn't say it back but my other coworkers did. She's done this a few days now, and thought something was off because before they she always said good morning first. 

What got to me was I ended up saying good morning to her after a while of her not saying a word to me. She replied and we started talking for a little while. My coworker came in and started talking to her and she was friendly to him, and I found that a little off because she wasn't friendly at all to me until I spoke to her first. She ended up engaging in a conversation with him more so than me. 

I left it to them and saw that she was asking him questions when she hardly initiates conversation. 

So ever since then I was rather cold towards her because it just didn't sit right with me with how the situation transpired. 

But guess what she ended up talking to me a few times because I wasn't pursuing her as much anymore but it was very short convos. Also I was on the phone later on in the shift and she looked over a little side not to make it obvious that she was curious as to what I was doing. 

I don't know do you think I'm over reacting and overthinking about this situation and I should just let it flow and still pursue her or should I just leave her alone?

1lavw04,https://www.reddit.com/r/tesco/comments/1lavw04/tifu_by_asking_for_help_with_a_disrespectful/,"TIFU by asking for help with a disrespectful customer, and now I’m facing a disciplinary.","
I work in retail, and last night I had a pretty tough encounter with a customer. The store was closing, and the tills were shut, so I closed off a guy’s checkout since it was after 10 PM and only the self-service machines were available.

A woman came up demanding that she get a staffed checkout or help at the customer service desk, but refused to use self-service, even though it was the fastest option for her (she only had a few items). I told her I could help her through self-service, but if that wasn’t acceptable, I could get a supervisor for her.

She wasn’t happy with this at all and started raising her voice at me, which I just couldn’t tolerate. I calmly told her that I couldn’t accept being treated this way, and I asked a colleague for help since my team leader was busy fixing a broken coffee machine and couldn’t assist at the moment.

I was pretty upset by the situation and ended up in tears after she continued to berate me. When she spoke to my team leader, she told them I’d only offered to get a supervisor after she asked for one, which wasn’t true at all. I had offered a solution before that, but it felt like my side wasn’t being heard.

I’ve been in similar situations before, so I was trying to follow the training I was given: if I feel unsafe or disrespected, I should ask for support. The team leader said I handled it well, but that I shouldn't have used the word ""abuse""—but honestly, I didn’t know how else to explain that I was being disrespected.

Now, it’s being passed on to my manager, and I’m worried that I might end up facing a disciplinary. It feels like they’re only hearing the customer’s side, and I’m just really upset because I genuinely tried to handle the situation calmly.

Did I do something wrong here? I feel like I was just following protocol, but now I’m feeling like I might get in trouble for trying to protect myself.

I paced outside of the Morgan & Co. building. I was hesitant to go inside. I hadn’t seen him since I ran away at 16. My mother had told me that if I wanted money to survive, I had to come ask him myself. She was tired of giving me money out of the allowance she got. If I were being honest with myself, I thought she had finally gone off her rocker and moved in with her pool boy lover. That made me even more anxious about being here. I cursed under my breath before forcing myself into the building. I signed in at the reception desk on the first floor before taking the elevator up to the 24th floor. The receptionist smiled at me. Madison Morgan! How are you, honey? It’s been a long time. I shifted uncomfortably in front of her. “I… uhmmm… sorry… I’m okay, Mrs. Taylor. How are you? “I’m great. Is your father expecting you? I cleared my throat. “He’s my stepfather!” I flushed at her raised eyebrow. I couldn’t help correcting people. I hated that my mother had married him. He was too serious and businesslike to be a good match for my mother’s flightiness. I knew she had cheated on him. She did it all the time. She was the reason that I ran away. I had caught her sleeping with my boyfriend in their marital bed. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves. Is he busy? Not yet. He has a meeting in 15 minutes. You can go back. I’ll let him know you’re here,” she said, reaching for the phone on her desk. I covered her hand, smiling at her. “It’s a surprise.” She nodded. “Okay. Go on, honey. “Thanks.”

I hurried past her desk to his office. I knocked softly on his door before stepping back and wiping my hands on my dress.



“COME IN!”



I jumped at his sudden, angry order. I timidly opened the door.



“I’m sorry to bother you-”



“In. Sit!”



I swallowed nervously as I crossed his office to sit in front of his desk, waiting for him to look up from the papers he was reading. He ignored my presence until I cleared my throat.



“The position's salary is $500,000 a year.”



My mouth fell open. “W-what?”



He rolled his eyes. “The assistant position that I have open.”



“Why does it pay so well?” I asked curiously.



“Because you will move into my house and be at my beck and call for every need that I have at work or at home.”



“E-every need?”



“Yes. It will be a free-use situation, but you will also handle all my schedule, my errands, and my finances.”



I stared at him in shock. “For $500,000 a year?”



“Yes.” He pulled a stack of papers out of his desk and set them in front of me, still not having looked at me. “If you sign this, you will leave from here to go to the doctor to get a STD workup. If you come back positive for any STDs, the contract is void. You must also start birth control if you are not already on it. Also, when my wife is home, you will not be allowed to be in the same space as her unless I want you to join us. Is that understood?”



“I-”



He held out a pen to me as he signed the papers he was working on. “Look it over and sign and initial the parts that need you to.”



His phone rang, and he immediately answered it, brandishing the pen at me. I hesitantly took it from him before starting to read the contract while I thought about signing it. It was obvious that I wasn’t who this contract was meant for, but I kind of wanted to get back at my mother for sleeping with my boyfriend. With the image of Nathan thrusting into my mother in my head, I began to initial and sign the document. When I was done, I pushed it back to him. He didn’t even look it over before he put it in his drawer. He finished his call and went back to the documents in front of him.



“Our day starts at 9 AM sharp. You will be in my office with a cup of coffee, two sugars, and half a creamer, naked and ready to be fucked. Lunch is promptly at 11:45 AM. You will give me a blowjob while I eat. At any other time I want to have sex, you are to be ready. If you can’t get wet, invest in some lube. You are to put my dinner on my table right at 6 PM, and at 7, I will fuck you in the kitchen while you clean it. I go to bed at 10. I don’t care what you do or when you sleep, as long as you are up at 7:30 AM for work. You are not to have any other males in your life while you are under contract. Am I clear?”



“Y-yes, sir.”



“Good. Get on your knees. I want a blow job.”



My eyes widened. “R-right now?”



“Yes,” he said, reaching for another document.



I shakily got to my knees to crawl under his desk. My hands trembled as I reached up to undo his pants. He stretched his legs out beside my body as he shifted down in his chair. I licked my lips nervously as his cock sprang free of his boxers. I stared at his long, thick member as it throbbed in front of my face. Oh, God, was I really about to do this? I took his cock in my hand, stroking it slowly until his hips started moving, making my strokes faster.



“Use your mouth,” he hissed from above me.



I leaned forward to lick his tip. He immediately thrust forward, pushing his cock into my mouth. He groaned as his hand came under the desk to tangle in my hair as he fucked my mouth. I massaged his balls, and he groaned again before his seat was tilted back. His other hand came under the desk to grab the other side of my head to hold me still while he thrust deeper into my mouth. When he hit the back of my mouth, I swallowed, taking him further down my throat.



“FUCK! Do that again!”



I swallowed again before moaning around his cock. He pulled my head down as he thrust deep inside my mouth. He held my head down while he only moved a small amount to press against the back of my throat. He grunted as he shot his load into my throat.



“Take it all,” he ordered.



I sucked hard on his tip to tease all of his cum out before swallowing it all. The door opened behind me, and I froze. My face turned beet red, and he stiffened.



“Tish? Who the hell?”



He pushed his chair back to look down at me. His eyes widened in panic, and he used the hand still in my hair to pull my mouth off his cock.



“Oh, God!”



I licked a drop of his cum off my lip. “Umm… hi…”



He let me go to put his cock back in his pants. He stood up, apologizing profusely to the woman at the door as he ushered her out with the promise to call her while I stayed under the desk, too embarrassed to move. After the door shut, he came back to the desk.



“Madison, you need to come out from under there, right now!”



I buried my hands in my face. “No. I think I’ll stay here until I die.”



His arm wrapped around my waist, yanking me out from under the desk. He spun me around to face him before tilting my chin up to make me look into his eyes.



“Madison, what in the hell are you doing here?”



“I-I came to ask you for money…” I murmured, still blushing.



He pulled me against his body, hugging me. “I’m so sorry, Maddie. I didn’t know that was you. How much do you need? I will give it to you. All you have to do is ask.”



“I was going to ask for $100,000.”



He let me go to move back to his desk. He quickly wrote me a check.



“Next time, just call.”



I stared at the check in my hands before looking up at him with tears in my eyes. “I signed your contract.”



He cursed as he ran his hand through his hair. “Maddie, what happened just now can’t ever happen again.”



“But-”



“No, Madison. It can’t. It was wrong.”



I lowered my head as I took several deep breaths before tearing the check up and throwing it at him like a handful of confetti.



“Fuck you and your money,” I whispered.



I spun on my heels and stormed out of the office. I hated him. I had been good enough for five minutes of pleasure, but not good enough for anything else. Well, fuck him! I would make it on my own. Fucking dick!



﻿**Chapter 2**

I stormed out of my office and went to the receptionist, who monitored the lobby on my floor. There was nobody else on the floor except me so I gave her Madison’s number to try to reach her while I continued with my day. She looked up at me, smiling. “Any luck?”



“No, sir.”



“How many times have you called?” I asked.



“Repeatedly, like you asked, Mr. Morgan.”



“The number, Jane. How many times?”



“63 times in the last hour and a half, Mr. Morgan.”



I gave her a curt nod before going back to my office. I snatched my phone off its cradle, dialing Amber’s number. She answered after four rings.



“Joey,” she purred.



“Can it, Amber! Have you heard from Madison?”



“Of course I have. She’s my daughter,” she sneered.



“SHE’S OUR DAUGHTER, AMBER! NOW, TELL ME WHERE IS SHE?!”



“Whatever, Joey.”



She hung up, and I angrily pushed the button on the phone to call her back. She sent me straight to voicemail, and I set up the phone again, immediately calling her back.



“WHAT?!” She screamed.



“Come to the office. Let’s talk,” I say, barely holding my anger back.



I tapped my fingers on the desk while she had a whispered conference with her lover.



“It’ll cost you.”



I rolled my eyes. Of course it would. Everything with her did. It was just who she was. She always failed to remember that no price was too high when it came to Madison. “How much?”



I waited impatiently, as there was another whispered conference. “$500 thousand.”



“I will send you half now, and then the other half when you get here.”



I pulled up my bank account to make the transfer when she screamed to wait. I let out an angry exhale.



“Make it a million, and I’ll be there in 30 minutes.”



I transferred the money, and I knew she had received it when she squealed in my ear.



“30 minutes, Amber, or else I’m coming for you.”



I hung up on her to call Madison myself. I threw my phone across the room when my call was forwarded after three rings, telling me Madison had seen it was me calling and rejected it. I got up to pace around my office with my hands behind my back. If she didn’t get here soon, I was going to break down her fucking door. The door opened behind me, and I spun around to glare at my wife. Her perfectly curled, dirty blonde hair and beautifully done makeup gave Amber a look of sophistication that hid her true self.



She was a snake that killed everything good around her and was only good enough for an occasional roll in the hay. She had even tried to break Madison down. I don’t know what she told my daughter to make her hate me so much that she hadn’t spoken to me in two years, but I didn’t care. I had the chance to get back into Madison’s life, and I wasn’t going to let Amber get in my way. She leaned her hip against my desk, purposely crossing her arms under her breasts to push them up.



“Is this about Madison?”



“Where is she?”



She shrugged. “I don’t know. Why?”



“STOP IT, AMBER! AND TELL ME WHERE MY DAUGHTER IS!”



She narrowed her eyes on me. “Why the sudden interest in my daughter? You haven’t been worried about her since she left. Why now?”



“YOUR DAUGHTER?! YOUR DAUGHTER?! SHE IS MY DAUGHTER!”



She looked down at her nails before looking smugly back up at me. “You may have signed her birth certificate, but you are not her father. Sam is.”



I grabbed her around the throat, pinning her on top of my desk. “Your pregnancy with her is the only reason I married your ass. You told me I was her father!”



“I told you several times that you weren’t her father. It’s not my fault that you didn’t believe me,” she snapped.



“YOU ONLY SAID THAT WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING AND THE NEXT DAY SHE WAS BACK TO BEING MY DAUGHTER! I NEVER THOUGHT YOU MEANT IT! AND NOW YOU’RE SAYING THAT SHE’S NOT MINE! SHE WAS THE ONLY REASON THAT I ALLOWED ALL OF YOUR BACKSTABBING WHORING WAYS! I TOOK CARE OF HER! I PROVIDED FOR HER! I WENT TO HER RECITALS AND ATTENDED ALL THE DADDY DAUGHTER DANCES! I LOVED HER! THAT’S WHAT MAKES ME HER FATHER!”



She spit in my face. “That makes you a fool!”



I slammed my fist into the desk beside her head. “I’ll be a fool over her!” I hissed as I flipped her over before placing a piece of paper and pen in front of her. “Her address! I know you know it! Write it down! Now! This is nonnegotiable!”



“It’ll cost you!”



I let her go to move around my desk to the safe behind it. I pulled a black card out of it before throwing it in her face as I dialed the number to the bank the card was attached to. I turned the phone toward her, ordering her to type the card number in. She did and when she heard that there were 11.72 million dollars in the account, her eyes widened. I hung the phone up before pushing the paper back toward her.



“The address, Amber, and the card is yours.”



She quickly wrote down an address about 15 minutes away before shoving the paper in my face.



“Nice doing business with you,” she sneered.



I rolled my eyes as she headed toward the door.



“Oh, and Amber?”



“What, Joey?”



“Stay away from Madison. I won’t let you turn her into you.”



She looked over her shoulder at me. “She’s my daughter, Joseph. It’s in her blood.”



She walked out, cackling like a lunatic, leaving me fuming and asking myself what I had ever seen in her. I grabbed my suit jacket as I stormed out of my office to go to the address on the paper. I pulled up in front of the dilapidated building, getting even more furious that this was where she had been living. It was a well-known drug area with a lot of prostitution. I had to get her out of here. She was too good to live here.



I rushed inside, only giving the out-of-order elevator a quick glance before racing up the stairs to the third floor. Her apartment was directly across from the stairs, and I wasted no time banging on it while calling her name. After a few minutes of her not answering, a woman poked her head out of an apartment three doors down.



“She’s not there. She left about an hour ago.”



“Do you know where she went?” I asked. The woman shook her head. I sighed. “Do you know when she’ll be home?” Again, she shook her head. “Thank you.”



I spun on my heels to make my way back down to my car. I was determined to find her, and nothing was going to stop me. I knew her well enough, or so I thought, to find her. My Porsche roared down the street as I went to all of her favorite hangouts from when she was 16. The only thing that kept me from going crazy as I searched for her was the fact that she wasn’t my biological daughter. It made me feel less disgusting. Not much, but enough to keep me from feeling like a complete piece of shit for what happened in my office. At 11 PM, I gave up looking to go back to her apartment. I clenched my jaw when she still wasn’t home. Where the fuck was she?

As I neared the door to leave her building, her loud laughter made me sprint outside, only to draw up short when I saw her all over four other young men. I instantly knew she was wasted, and they weren’t. It renewed my fury as I stomped down the stairs.



“MADISON RENE MORGAN!”



Her head snapped around to look at me before she broke out into a fit of giggles.



“Oh, look, boys. It’s my Daddy,” she slurred.



I pointed to the ground in front of me. “Come here! Right now!”



She met my eyes. “I’m grown. You can’t boss me around.” She smiled up at one of the men, gripped his collar, and swayed a little. “But you can boss me around,” she said flirtatiously.



I began to roll my dress shirt sleeves up. “I’m warning you, Madison. Say goodnight to your guests…”



“Or what?” She snapped. “You’re just mad that I didn’t take your money after I blew you.” She giggled before turning her attention back to the guys. “I was going to give him my virginity, but now you can have it. You can be my Daddy for the night.”



“That’s it,” I said as I lunged forward to grab her.



I threw her over my shoulder, holding her legs down as she flailed. I narrowed my eyes on the men.



“Get out of here.”



I didn’t wait to see if they complied or not as I carried Madison inside her apartment. I removed her keys from her pocket to unlock her door before locking it and carrying her toward the end of the short hallway where I saw her bed. I tossed her down on it, and she giggled.



“You’re too young to drink, Madison! What in the hell were you thinking?”



“WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, DADDY?” She screamed. “SPANK ME? Well, here you go!”



She struggled to roll over and pull her dress up. I swallowed hard when her thick ass cheeks came into view. She wiggled a little, and I was hypnotized for a moment by the way her thong shifted between her cheeks. I reached out to run my hand over her ass before slapping it once and pulling her dress back down. She rolled back over to glare at me.



“That’s all?”



“Don’t push me, Madison. You need to go to sleep.”



She jumped to her feet and immediately fell forward into my chest. She tipped her head back to look up at me.



“You don’t want me.”



I wrapped my arms around her. “Maddie, sweetheart, I’ve always wanted you. Just not in that way.”



A tear rolled down her cheek, and I immediately felt like a bastard again. “I just wanted to make her pay,” she sobbed.



“For what?”



“For sleeping with Nathan. It’s why I ran away.”



I picked her up before sitting on the edge of her bed, cradling her in my arms. “Maddie, you don’t have to sleep with me to get back at her.”



She sniffled. “She told me that you hated me and were glad I left.”



I stared at her. Amber said what? “I looked for you, baby. I hired private investigators, but they couldn’t find you.”



She buried her face in my chest. “She told me that everything was my fault. That you didn’t pay attention to her because of me. She said that you didn’t know how to be a man, just a father.”



I tucked her face into my neck as I rocked her. “Go to sleep, Madison.”



She wrapped her arms around my waist, and I laid my cheek on top of her head. None of the mess between her mother and me was her fault. I couldn’t believe that Amber had said those things to her. Actually, I could, and I was going to make her pay. I took a deep breath, already regretting that if Madison wanted to get back at her mother in the morning, I was going to let her. No matter how she wanted to do it. If tonight proved anything, it was that I no longer felt entirely fatherly toward my little girl.

﻿**Chapter 3**

I groaned as I opened my eyes. I felt so sick, and I needed to vomit. I rolled onto my side as my stomach heaved. God, what in the hell have I done? I never drank. Not since the night my biological father tried to climb into my bed when I was staying with him. I had barely gotten away, and I had vowed to never drink again. Fuck, I messed up. I laughed hysterically for a moment as I thought about my Daddy issues. The father who wanted to sleep with me disgusted me, but the one who didn’t made me actually want him more with his rejection.

My stomach rolled again, and I grabbed the large mixing bowl off my bedside table to vomit in. When I was done, I put it back down to tear the Tylenol packet open to swallow them whole with a swig of water from the glass there. Wait! What the hell? I looked down at my clothes and was shocked to see that I had been put into a nightgown. I jumped up, swooning at the sudden movement. I grabbed the bowl again as my body threatened to vomit again. When my stomach stopped rolling, I put the bowl down to pull my nightgown away from my skin. I breathed a sigh of relief when I still wore my underclothes from the night before. Who in the hell had changed my clothes? I sat back on the bed as I started remembering who. Joseph Morgan. The man who raised me. The man who rejected me, after I had given him a blowjob, had me wanting to prove that I was desirable. Fuck.



I got up again to find my phone, but it was nowhere to be found. I got up to search the rest of my shitty apartment for it. I really needed to apologize to him and thank him for not letting me make what would have been the biggest mistake of my life. I checked the kitchen and was on my way to the dining room when snoring drew me to the living room. When I saw him asleep on my couch with one arm over his face and a leg over the back of the couch, I smiled. He stayed. My heart warmed a little at the realization that he cared enough to make sure I would be okay. He must have left the bowl and Tylenol for me. I slowly crossed the room, watching him for any signs that he was waking up, before crawling on top of him, snuggling into him like I always used to when I was little and needed my Daddy to comfort me. I jumped and tried to get up when his arm went around my waist. He turned his head so that his mouth was against my ear.



“Stay.”



I swallowed hard. “T-thank you for the Tylenol,” I stammered.



He kissed my cheek. “How do you feel?”



“My head hurts, and I have to vomit.”



He chuckled, and I swooned again, but this time it wasn’t from how I physically felt. I turned my head, almost groaning, when my lips met his. When he shifted under me, I let out a shaky breath. His eyes darkened before he increased the pressure of our lips touching. I closed my eyes as our almost innocent kiss continued. Finally, he pulled away.



“Madison, what do you want?”



I opened my eyes to look into his. What did I want? I wasn’t entirely sure of anything beyond this moment happening right now. Right then, I wanted him but would I want him later on? I couldn’t say for sure. Maybe I was just being an angry teenager who wanted to rebel against her mother. Maybe my teenage crush was rearing its ugly head again. Maybe this was only because I had needs that a vibrator couldn’t meet, and I trusted him. He was a safe bet. I knew he wouldn’t hurt me.



“Maddie?”



I leaned down to kiss him again, making him groan before I pulled back. “I… I want you,” I whispered shyly.



He cupped my face, stroking my cheek. “Okay.”



“Okay? Just like that?”



“On one condition.”



“What condition?” I asked curiously.



“That you’re not my biological daughter. I want a DNA test.”



“That’s all?”



“Yep.”



I pushed myself up to go to the small desk against the left wall. I grabbed the manilla envelope inside the bottom drawer. I walked back to him, holding the envelope out to him. He took it from me and quickly read the contents. His body started to tremble in anger.



“You knew I wasn’t your father?” He asked furiously.



I nodded. “Mom told me when I was 8. She said that if I told you, you would send us away. I didn’t want to leave you. You were my favorite person.”



He pulled me back onto his lap to hold me tightly against his chest. “I wouldn’t have ever sent you away.”



I wrapped my arms around his neck. “I know that now.”



His hands hesitantly moved down my body to cup my ass, shaping my cheeks before spreading them a little. When his fingers ran down my spine, moving between my cheeks, I moaned softly. He pressed the nightgown against my asshole before lifting me a little on my knees to shape my nightgown around my thighs. He gripped my thighs from behind as he slowly lowered me onto his lap so that I could feel his erection.



“Ooooh,” I moaned as he teasingly moved me back and forth over his erection.



“I have a list of things I want you to do today, Maddie, while I’m at work.”



“L-like w-what?” I stuttered, trying to focus on his words as my body started coiling inside.



He smoothly shifted our positions so that I was on my back on the couch while he leaned over me, looking into my eyes.



“I have been watching my insurance. You have either paid out of pocket for medical expenses or you haven’t been going for checkups. My bet is on you not going.” He thrust harder against my core, making me almost scream in frustration when our clothes kept him from driving into me like I wanted him to. “I want you to go get a full workup done. Head to toe, Madison. Bloodwork, STD panel, the works. Do you understand me?”



I bent my leg at the knee so I could push up against him harder. “Y-yes,” I moaned. “Whatever you say.”



“Next, I want you to go shopping and buy new clothes. Your clothes are all worn and need to be replaced.”



I arched my back as his hand bunched my nightgown at my hips. “YES! YES!” I screamed.



“Lastly…”



I started panting as I strained against him more. “Please, don’t stop!”



He gripped my chin to force me to look into his eyes. “Lastly, you will start to pack up this apartment. You’re coming home.”



“Home? I-”



His hand moved under my nightgown to grip the little bit of material on my thong before using it to rub over my clit, making me even crazier. I wrapped my arms around his neck to pull him down to kiss me while he continued to pinch and massage my clit through my thong. I lifted my hips to position his tented pants at my entrance, pushing against him as our lips clung to each other. My eyes closed as my head dropped back. He took full advantage of my newly exposed skin to nibble and lick down my neck.



“Maddie,” he moaned.



“Daddy,” I cried, lifting my hips again.



“Fuck!”



He tilted my hips, changing the way his suit pants brushed against me, making my movements even more wild.



“That’s it, baby. Just like that.”



“I’m so close,” I whimpered.



Suddenly, he pulled away, leaving me a quivering mess on the couch. I screamed in frustration, making him chuckle.



“Be a good girl and do what I asked you to do, and I will reward you tonight,” he told me.



I glared at him. “Asshole.”



He lifted his hand up, and I swallowed hard when I saw the fluid that I knew was mine glistening on it. He met my eyes as he swirled his tongue around his fingers, cleaning all of my wetness off of them.



“Guess you better hurry up, babygirl. I expect to see you in my office at 4:30 PM.” He laid two cards on the table along with my cell phone. “Be careful.”



I flipped him off, making him chuckle again as he leaned to kiss me.



“Behave, you little naughty girl.”



He went behind the couch to pick up his suit jacket off the floor. I watched his muscles flex as he put it on before looking into his eyes.



“I don’t have STDs. I’m a virgin.”



His eyes moved over my body, lingering on my curves. “I know. Just do the tests, Madison, please.”



I sighed. “Okay.”



He walked to the door before turning back toward me. “By the way, you taste as good as I imagined you would. Just fucking sensational.”



My cheeks heated as he walked out of the door. I must be crazy to let him touch me like he just did, but damn if it didn’t feel good. And the bonus was that I was desirable. I bit my lip as I remembered the hungry look in his eyes when he said I tasted good. I giggled. Not just good, sensational.

**Chapter 4**

I taped the box I was packing up. It hadn’t taken me long to pack up the small apartment. None of the furniture was mine so all I had was my clothes, toiletries, and a few dishes. The hardest part of packing had been breaking down my small desk and that only took me an hour to do by myself. I carried the box out of my front door to put it on top of the other 16 boxes there. I sighed, realizing again that all my boxes wouldn’t fit into my sedan and that I would have to come back to get the rest of my things.



After a quick check of the apartment, I picked up one of the bigger boxes to carry down to my car. When I stepped off the bottom stair, my name was called behind me. I groaned, recognizing my landlord’s voice. I kept moving outside to my car, setting the box down so I could open my trunk as my landlord stormed up to me.



“Are you moving out?” He asked angrily.



I swallowed nervously. “Yes.”



“You have 8 months left on your lease. You have to give me the rent. You can’t just leave. It’s a violation of the terms of the lease. I will sue you for 3 times what you owe me per the lease you signed.”



Before I could respond, a man stepped between me and my landlord. “How much is your rent, Miss Morgan?”



“Who are you?” I asked.



“My name is irrelevant. Mr. Morgan asked me to watch over you today in case you needed anything. I am to ensure your safety and handle anything you need on your behalf.”



I stared at the back of his head. “H-he did?”



“Yes, ma’am. If you would tell me how much your rent is, I can write him a check to cover three times what you have left.”



“$1,250,” I told him.



He pulled a checkbook out of his pocket before writing out a check and handing it to the landlord, who immediately grinned.



“When can you be out?”



I rolled my eyes. “Today, I hope.”



The man between us turned toward me. “How much more do you have to bring down?”



“Like a dozen boxes and my desk.”



“I will gather the rest of it for you and take it to Mr. Morgan’s house. Are you heading to his office now?”



“What time is it?”



“4:25 PM.”



I slapped my hand against my forehead. “Oh, God. I’m late. Can you help me put this box in my trunk?”



He easily lifted the box for me before shutting the door. I pushed my apartment keys into his hands, quickly telling him my apartment number and to leave all the furniture. I jumped into my car and was speeding toward the office in seconds, watching the minutes tick on as I drove. I slammed to a stop outside of the building before racing inside. I bypassed the main lobby’s check in desk as I rushed to the elevators, furiously pushing the up button. The elevator took forever to arrive on the ground floor and took even longer to take me up to his floor. As soon as I stepped out, Mrs. Taylor waved me to the back.



“Go on. You’re late. You know how Mr. Morgan is when people are tardy.”



Dread filled me. I did know. He would be angry and I hated when he was angry. I knocked on his office door, entering at his brisk acknowledgement. I bit my lip at the look of agitation on his face when he saw me.



“I’m sorry I was late. I-”



He pointed to the chair in front of his desk. “Sit!”



I gulped nervously as I walked across the room to sit down.



“You’re late!” He snapped.



I lowered my head. “I apologize. I was packing my apartment up.”



“Is it done?”



“Yes, sir.""



“Did you go to the doctor?”



I nodded, reaching into my pocket to pull out the small folded up packet the doctor’s receptionist had given me to place it in front of him. “Yes, sir.”



“Did you get birth control?” He asked, ignoring the paper.



“Yes, sir.”



“Did you go shopping?”



“Yes, sir, and I had everything I bought delivered to your house,” I answered, blushing as I thought about the one store I had shopped at.



“I have a new contract for you to sign.”



He put a stack of papers in front of me and my head snapped up.



“A new contract?”



“Yes. The other one was void. It wasn’t meant for you. Read it over and decide if you want to sign it.”



I slowly made my way through it, already signing and initialing it as I read, not really caring about the terms. I paused at one, glancing at him.



“Why is this so different from the other one?”



“Because you are important to me. The other contract was made to prevent feelings from forming. It’s already too late for that with you.”



“But… What if it changes things between us? Aren’t you worried about that?”



He set his pen down to look at me, slightly annoyed. “The only difference in that contract is that it allows us to spend time together. We can go out to meals together and go on other outings. It states that you don’t have to hide when your mother is around and that you have the right to say no to certain things that I might ask you for. It also says that the salary is yours and I will cover your bills for the duration of the contract. On the last page there is space for you to list stipulations that you want from me during our contract. I will review them and then sign and initial them if I agree. You don’t have to sign the contract if you don’t agree to the terms.”



My heart sped up a little at his explanation. He was being so kind to me through this whole thing. I quickly finished signing the contract before stopping on the last page where I could list my demands. As I tried desperately to think of at least one, I tapped the pen on his desk, giving up a few minutes later and pushing the contract back across the desk to him. He quickly flipped through it, pausing on the last page to look up at me.



“There’s nothing you want?” I shook my head. He leaned back in his chair, studying me. “So, I can sleep with other women and you would be okay with it?”



My chest tightened but I forced myself to nod. “If that’s what you wanted to do.”



He wrote a few things down before putting the contract back in front of me. I looked at what he added.







1. Joseph Morgan will not be involved with any other females except Amber Morgan.



2. Joseph Morgan will pay for Madison Morgan’s college tuition.



3. At the conclusion of the contract, Joseph Morgan will purchase a home of Madison Morgan’s choice for her.



4. Madison Morgan may terminate the contract at any point for any reason.







I looked up at him in shock. “A-are you sure?”



He nodded. “Very. Sign it,” he said, holding a pen out to me.



I quickly signed it before he took it back to initial and sign it, too. “Now that part is done, I recall that a certain someone was late to our meeting.”



His chair squeaked slightly as he got up to walk around the desk. He walked to the door to lock it before coming back to pull me up to take me to the couch. He met my eyes as he unbuttoned my shorts before pushing them off my hips to hit the floor. He looked down to take in my red lacy boy shorts as he fingered the edges.



“Get on the couch, facing the back and lean over it,” he ordered gruffly.



I hesitantly did as he asked, feeling way too exposed in front of him. His hands moved up my thighs to my ass where he massaged my ass before spanking me hard enough to leave my skin stinging. I cried out, more in shock than in pain. He spanked me again and my body started to tighten as I got aroused. When he spanked me again, I moaned before clamping my mouth shut, praying that he hadn’t heard it. He spanked me again before getting behind me on the couch with his legs on either side of mine.



“Do you like it when I spank you, babygirl?”



I nodded. His hand wiggled between me and the couch, to pinch my clit before patting my pussy hard, making another moan slip out. He pushed my hair to the side with his nose to kiss along my throat. My breath caught in my lungs when his expert fingers snaked under my panties to rub my clit some more while his mouth continued its assault on my throat. I shivered and he moved his fingers lower to gently stroke them along my wet lower lips.



“You were a bad girl, Madison,” he said roughly in my ear.



I helplessly moved my hips to his fingers. “I need to be punished,” I panted.



He bit down on my collarbone. “Yes, you do,” he agreed as he thrust two fingers up inside of me, causing me to scream out louder.



He pressed me against the back of the couch to still my movements as he continued to repeatedly pull his fingers out before burying them back inside of my pussy while I continued to mewl in pleasure. I let my head fall back on his shoulder as his fingers were forced to slow as my pussy gripped him harder until he groaned, almost unable to retract his fingers as I climaxed. My body shook uncontrollably until I slumped back against him, panting. He chuckled as he slowly pulled his fingers out of me, breathing deeply when my pussy clenched around them again, trying to hold him there. I flushed.



“I’m sorry. I-”



He silenced me with a hard kiss. “Get dressed, Maddie. I’m taking you home.

SSG announced on the 12th that they will hold the 'Beyond 500 Festival' event to celebrate and commemorate Choi Jeong's 500th home run in the KBO League during a three-game series against the KIA Tigers at the Incheon SSG Landers Field from the 20th to the 22nd. 

Choi Jeong, a living legend of SSG, became the first player in KBO League history to reach 500 home runs in the match against the NC Dinos in Incheon on the 13th. SSG planned this event to celebrate Choi Jeong's great record with fans. 

The main event will be held on the 21st. Choi Jeong's fan signing event will be held on that day. Applications for participation will be accepted from the 12th to the 16th. Applications can be made on the event page in the Landers official application, and 50 fans will be selected through a raffle. 

 Before the game starts, the KBO official awards ceremony will be held, and after the game, a fireworks festival will be held to celebrate the 500th home run. 
Fans who visit the stadium during the three-game series can also receive various gifts. 

On June 20, a coffee truck prepared by Choi Jeong himself will be set up at Frontier Square. 1,000 cups of iced Americano will be provided free of charge on a first-come, first-served basis. 

On the 21st, 5,000 flags with the 500th home run commemorative logo will be distributed, and on the 22nd, 5,000 key rings made using the commemorative logo will be distributed. 

A special ticket package will also be operated for two days on the 21st and 22nd. 268 seats in the 3rd base outfield field seats (blocks 112-113) will be sold as the Beyond 500 ticket package. 

 Spectators who reserve seats for this event can wear the home run factory manager helmet and top that Choi Jeong wore in the past All-Star Game and cheer along with the special cheering squad. 

In addition, SSG plans to decorate the baseball stadium with a Choi Jeong theme. During the three days of the event, a 'Choi Jeong Photo Zone' will be set up inside Gate 3. Here, actual memorabilia such as the ceremony trophy, bat, and ball used when achieving 500 home runs will be displayed. 

Also, if you upload a photo taken in the photo zone or the outfield Legendary Home Run Zone to Instagram, 5 people will be entered into a raffle to receive a Choi Jeong 500 home run commemorative uniform as a gift.

There are a total of 11 commemorative items including uniforms, hats, commemorative balls, commemorative bats, and key rings, and you can purchase them at a 20% discount.

1lavjji,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lavjji/7_devils_bridge/,7 devils bridge,"South Carolina is full of ghost stories, most of them cheap thrills born of boredom or drunken dares for teenagers. But Seven Devil’s Bridge? That one stuck with me. Not because I believed in restless spirits or midnight curses, but because i was once one of those bored teenagers, and although i didn't see anything, i heard...something, I've regrated hearing ever since. I didn't believe in ghosts. I just enjoyed fear, and in a smalltown there wasn't much to do. So one day a few friends and I went to go see the Seven Devils Bridge.



The night we went to Seven Devil’s Bridge was thick with humidity, nothing new For South Carolina, it was often hot and humid. The air so still it felt like the world was holding its breath. The road leading up to the bridge was barely visible, swallowed by trees that loomed in from both sides, backroads upon backroads. My friends joked and shoved each other, their laughter sharp against the quiet, but I wasn’t laughing. I was listening, the air felt electric, and i felt something....different.



We stood on the bridge, waiting. The legend said that if you crossed at midnight, you wouldn’t make it to the other side. A lot of nonsense, I thought. Still, we were bored, and just wanted to get out of the house, this was supposed to be just another thing to do, to kill time. So I leaned against the rusted railing, staring down at the shallow creek below, waiting for something, anything to happen, to prove me wrong.



That’s when I heard it. A low cry? It was almost melodic, but broken, fragmented. 

Like sound whispering through static. My head snapped toward my friends, but they were still laughing, still shoving, completely unaware.



The sound twisted, shifting between notes, growing more distinct. Now just a hum. A voice? But the words were impossible to understand. My pulse hammered. I tried to shake it off, tried to tell myself it was the wind, the water below, some trick of my tired mind, but it was gone now, The wind blew gently, the slow flow of water in the creak droned, yet i didn’t move. The sound, whatever it was, now gone, but the feeling of being watched remained.



""what was that?"" i wasn't sure if i was asking myself, my friends or the air, my two friends looked at me amused.

""what are you actually getting freaked out?"" Dale asked, a smirk on his face, while James was dicking around on his phone....did i imagine it? 

Trying to shrug the overwhelming feeling of eyes on me i simply suggested we should go get a bit to eat on the way home, and we left, my friends still lulling about, i found myself antsy, slowing my walking to match there pace.

""get ahold of yourself pussy"" i remember telling myself before pushing my thoughts away as we drove away from Seven Devils Bridge





The drive home should have put it out of my mind. Dale and James kept up their usual antics, arguing over where to grab food, complaining about how dead the town was, but I barely heard them, there in body alone. I kept glancing at the rearview mirror, almost waiting to see something lurking behind us. Nothing. Just the empty road stretching into the night.



Then the first time I heard it again, I was alone.



It was the next morning, in my room, just before sunrise. That same sound, quiet as a hum, distant but impossible to ignore. My stomach twisted. I sat up, listening, holding my breath. It sounded closer now. Like it was inside.



I turned toward my closet, setting ajar, hadn't i closed it the night before? i couldn't remember, i couldn't be sure.

No. No way. I got up, slammed it shut. The humming faded slowly.



For a while, i just sat there, unsure of what i heard, then my alarm went off, I jolted up again as if just waking up, ""was that real...was i dreaming? the uncertainty bleeding reality into fiction. 



At school, it was worse. I was spacing out in class, (i was usually sleeping in class but i felt so wired) then i thought i heard it again. Not a cry this time. Words. Garbled, slipping between syllables like a language I knew but couldn't understand. I looked around but no one else reacted. I pressed my palms against my face, squeezing my eyes shut.



""Not real. Not real."" i thought like a mantra i could will into existence.



But when I opened them, my hands...they weren’t my hands.



They looked...wrong. Smaller? Thinner? Not mine. Not human?



I blinked, and they were normal again. A distant voice in my ear let out a sharp laugh before fading into nothing.



what i felt then wasn't just fear. i was frozen in place, the bell rang but i sat there, not moving till i heard the shovel of the next classes feet. i quickly got up, shaking, sweating, and darted out of the room and into the bathroom, after emptying my stomach and leaving the restroom i had one thought, ""Fuck This"".

Within the next 15 minutes i was getting into my friends old white chevy truck and we were peeling outta the parking lot, i remember thinking ""eh at least i showed up today"" to clarify i wasn't a great student.

For the next few days, life settled back into the usual haze of wasted hours and half-hearted decisions. No whispers. No voices. No twisted hallucinations.



I convinced myself it had all been some weird trick of exhaustion, or the mind, maybe both, maybe a leftover fear from that damn bridge. So I let it go. I spent the afternoons gaming with Dale and James, trash talking, losing track of time until the sky outside turned deep blue. I skipped school like usual, slept till noon, smoked just enough to keep reality soft around the edges.



It was easy to pretend nothing had happened. Then, it came back, like a distant hum, it came back.



I was at Dale’s place, leaned back on his busted couch, controller in hand, barely focused on some yet another match we were winning or losing. James was rolling a blunt, moaning about how expensive good weed was getting. just another day. A normal day.



And then—the hum. Low and fractured. The kind of sound you’d hear if someone was standing just behind you, breathing words through gritted teeth, something more primal than anger. I stiffened.



James flicked his lighter, exhaling smoke. Dale cursed at the screen. Neither of them heard it. life parading on around me.



I swallowed hard, eyes darting toward the darkened hallway leading out of the living room we called home. Something was standing there, just a shape. Unmoving. Wrong.



I stared. Blinked. Gone.



I exhaled slowly, forcing a smirk, forcing myself back into the game. This wasn’t real. It wasn’t i told myself.



I took a deep inhale, letting the smoke roll through my lungs, heavier than it should’ve been. Relax. That’s what I needed. That’s what I told myself.



Dale was still talking, something about his ex and how she was “certifiably insane.” James was focused on rolling another blunt, eyes lazily tracking the process like it was second nature. Everything was normal. I was normal. This was normal.



Then—the sound. Subtle. Weaving between the static of the TV in the background. Like a breath beneath the silence.



I froze. focusing on the sound, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Paranoia. Overthinking.



Then, the voice came, low, sharp, slicing through the air like a blade.



""You are not alone.""



I choked on my breath, coughing violently, nearly knocking the coffee table over as i shot up and stumbled.



James frowned at me. Dale paused mid-sentence.



""You good?"" Dale asked, raising an eyebrow. I tried to speak, but my throat was locked up, my heart hammering against my ribs. Not alone? What the hell did that mean?



My head snapped toward the hallway again...nothing. But I swore I felt something standing there, watching. Breathing.



I gripped the edge of the couch, my pulse thundering, the high suffocating me instead of calming me.



James flicked his lighter, eyes narrowing. “You sure your good bro? something up?”



I let out a sharp, nervous laugh. it felt loud and forced.



""Nah, man, shit just hit me harder than I expected,"" I lied, forcing a smirk, wiping sweat from my forehead.



I was not alone. And i silently hoped i was just losing my mind.



The tension had reached a breaking point. I wasn’t hiding it well anymore, i couldn't, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, the way I flinched at sounds no one else seemed to hear. Dale and James had started watching me, their jokes turning into quiet questions, uneasy glances. I could see it in their faces, they knew something was wrong.



Finally, James snapped.



“Look, man, what the hell is up with you?” he asked, blunt tucked behind his ear, arms crossed. “You’ve been losing your mind ever since we went to the bridge.”



Dale nodded, leaning against his truck. “Yeah. You ain’t exactly subtle.”



I opened my mouth to lie, to brush it off, but I couldn’t. swallowing the lump in my throat i simply asked



“You think it started there?” voice hollow.



James and Dale exchanged a glance.



“I Guess...That’s the only thing that makes sense,” Dale said. “You were normal before.”



That word normal, hearing it in the context hurt.



James exhaled sharply. “Then maybe we gotta go back.”



My pulse spiked. “What?”



He shrugged. “Think about it. Maybe it’s like… I don’t know. maybe going back will help you chill out.”



Dale shrugged. “fuck it why not?”



I wanted to argue, I really did. But the voice—the one that had been whispering in my ear for days—had said something, hadn’t it?



""Come back."" ""Fix it.""



Against every ounce of logic in my body, in cold sweat I agreed.



Seven Devil’s Bridge looked different this night.



We stood at the edge, headlights casting long shadows over the cracked pavement, the quiet suffocating from all sides.



Dale was tense. James was still trying to act casual. But I? I felt sick.



“I don’t get it,” Dale muttered. “What are we even supposed to do?”



James shrugged. “See if something happens.”



I exhaled slowly, stepping forward. The air felt wrong, like the pressure had shifted. My hands shook, but I shoved them into my hoodie pockets. I had to do this.



Then, the humming began. Not distant this time. Not faint. Loud. Surrounding us. Wrapping around us like a silent beast.



Dale cursed, stepping back. James stiffened. They heard it...they HEARD IT!



Then we saw them. Seven figures. Hanging from the bridge.



Still. Twisting. Watching. crying.



Dale moved first.



A strangled sound escaped him, something between a scream and a curse, but he didn't stop to process what he was seeing. He ran.



James followed, stumbling backward, dragging me with him. His grip was tight, nails digging into my wrist, pulling me toward the truck like he was afraid the ground might swallow us.



Yet I hesitated. Not because I wanted to stay, but because the figures had turned their heads toward us.



Seven sets of hollow, bloodshot eyes, locked onto mine. Their swollen maggot filled mouths twisted, open but not speaking, tongues blackened and shriveled from the noose around their throats. But I heard them anyway.



""Come back."" ""left us."" ""Fix it.""



Then one of them moved.

e rope, a wet, tearing  gurgling sound filling the air.



Everything became a blur, before i knew what i had done I ran.



The truck door slammed behind me, Dale fumbling with the keys, James breathing hard beside me. The engine roared to life, the tires kicking gravel as we sped away, the bridge shrinking in the distance.



But the voices never faded, becoming a constant hum.



By the time we reached town, Dale’s hands were shaking too much to hold his phone, and James had gone silent—just staring at the road ahead, eyes wide, unblinking.



I sat in the back, gripping my knees, pulse hammering. Because even though we had left...I could still see them.



Now, they weren’t just at the bridge. They were everywhere.

A violent jerk, body convulsing against the rope.



The bridge never let us go. after that second visit, after we saw those...things, everything got worse. The air around us felt heavier, like we were dragging something unseen everywhere we went.



At first, I thought it was just me. The noises hadn’t stopped. It followed me home, curling beneath the sound of my breathing, hiding under the flicker of my bedroom light.



Then James called.



“I saw it again,” he whispered. “The bridge. But I wasn’t there. I was in my room, but when I blinked I-I was hanging from it.” Then Dale was next.



He slammed his palms against the hood of his truck one afternoon, shaking his head like he was trying to wake up. “I keep seeing them..Everywhere. In the mirror. Outside my window. In the backseat when I drive. They don’t move...but they’re watching.”



And me? I was drowning in it. The hallucinations weren’t just flickers anymore. They were vivid. Brutal.



I couldn’t tell if I was awake or dreaming, because every time I blinked, I saw them die, at times, seeing US die.



The first man—he kicked. Struggled. His fingers clawed at the rope around his neck, body convulsing as blood pooled behind his eyes.



The second. Silent. Motionless. Accepting the fate she'd been given.



The third screamed, a raw, splintering sound that tore through my skull, his mouth twisted open as if the air had been ripped from his lungs.



And the rest, they watched me.



Even as they hung—the stares burned into me. 



I gripped my desk, panting, choking on air, the classroom around me collapsing into static. Dale and James were looking at me.



They knew. Because now, they had seen it too.



The days after the second visit blurred into something fractured. None of us could hold onto reality the way we used to.



Yet I wasn’t alone anymore. Now, Dale and James heard them too.



The voices had spread like an infection, crawling into our lives, twisting in ways none of us could ignore. And the hallucinations were worse.



after me, James saw them after.



It was late, maybe two in the morning, when he called. His voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.



“They’re here.”



I sat up, gripping my phone. “Where?”



“My room.” His breath hitched. “Hanging. From the ceiling.”



A hollow silence stretched between us. I tried to think, maybe he was just seeing it, just reliving the moment, but then, his voice cracked.



“They’re moving this time.”



I couldn’t respond. Because I knew James was right.



It wasn’t just frozen images anymore. They were changing. Shifting. Growing closer, i had seen them as well.



Then Dale had his turn.



I met up with him a few days later, standing outside his truck, the air thick with weed smoke and something wrong.



“I can’t look in my mirrors anymore,” he muttered, staring past me, eyes red-rimmed and dry. “Every time I do, I see one of them behind me.”



I swallowed hard. He dragged a hand through his hair. “I think it’s getting worse.”



And I knew he was right. Because now, they weren’t just hanging from the bridge.



They were hanging from us. 



The unraveling was slow, but inevitable, I should’ve seen it coming.



One day sitting in Dale’s truck, parked behind the abandoned gas station on the edge of town. a regular hang out spot for us, James was jittery, legs bouncing, knuckles tight around a half-smoked cigarette. Dale was eerily still, staring ahead, barely blinking.



The silence between us felt wrong, uncomfortable, heavy, suffocating, buzzing with something we couldn’t name.



Then Dale twitched. A sharp inhale. Fingers curling into fists. His jaw locked.



“Dale?” I frowned, shifting toward him. “You good?”



He didn’t answer. Instead, his head snapped toward James, eyes wide, wild, like he didn’t recognize him.



And then, he lunged.



James barely had time to react before Dale’s hands were around his throat, knocking him back against the passenger door.



“Dude!” I shouted, scrambling to pull him off.



James choked, gasping, nails digging into Dale’s arms, struggling to push him away, but Dale’s grip tightened.



His eyes weren’t normal, they were bloodshot, blown wide, like something else was looking through them.



And then he spoke. though it wasn’t his voice.



""You crossed the bridge."" ""You left us there."" ""Why did you leave?""



My stomach dropped.



I grabbed Dale, yanking him back with everything I had, forcing him against the seat, pinning his wrists.



James coughed violently, sucking in air, shaking all over.



Dale blinked fast—something snapped back into place. His face crumpled, realization hitting like a freight train.



“Oh my God,” he whispered. His whole body trembled, eyes darting between me and James. “I—I didn’t mean to—I don’t know what—”



James was still catching his breath, rubbing his throat. His expression wasn’t angry. It was terrified.



Dale’s hands trembled as he reached for James, stopping short. both were terrified.



“I don’t know what happened,” he breathed. “I swear to God, I wasn’t—I don’t even remember—”



None of us knew what to say. Because deep down, we knew the truth. It wasn’t Dale.



Not really.



The next week passed in a haze of frantic research and uneasy silence.



None of us wanted to talk about what happened in the truck. Dale afraid to ask for forgiveness, and would James even accept it? We moved carefully around each other, conversations clipped, tensions hanging in the air like fog.



But the whispers never stopped.



James buried himself in old news articles, digging through anything that mentioned Seven Devil’s Bridge. He found scraps, bits of folklore, missing persons reports, vague warnings dating back decades.



Dale spent nights glued to his laptop, scrolling through conspiracy forums, desperate for anything that felt familiar. And me? I was lost, just listened.



Slowly the voices were changing.



""You don’t belong."" ""you never left. ""Fix it.""



The more we searched, the worse it got as time passed, Reality slipped.



And then James woke up wrong.



I got a call at dawn, his voice shaking, not normal, not James.



“I—I don’t—” His breath came sharp, clipped, uneven. “There’s blood in my bed.”



I sat up fast, heart hammering, the fog of sleep washing away quickly. “What?”



“I-I...don’t know where it came from.” His voice cracked. “I....don’t know if it’s mine.”



Something cold settled in my stomach. ""Did he-no....no""



Dale and I rushed over.



James was waiting for us on his porch, skin pale, pupils blown wide like he hadn’t slept. He led us into his home, slowly, reluctant.

It dawned on me that he hadn't been inside since our call.



The sheets, soaked. Rust-colored, thick, too much blood for one person.



But James had no wounds, Nothing at all, Nothing on him. And the worst part?



When Dale pulled back the blankets, there were handprints.



Seven of them. Smudged into the fabric, fingers long, warped.



close but not human, i swear i saw claw marks, but couldn't be sure.



James sat on the floor, shaking, staring at his hands like they weren’t his. “I don’t—I don’t remember falling asleep.”



Dale swallowed hard. “maybe you didn’t?”



None of us had an answer, because now, it wasn’t just hallucinations anymore.



It was real, and we couldn't differentiate reality from fiction anymore, reality and ""fiction"" were melding together. 



Desperation led us back.



After a week of finding nothing, no explanations, no answers, just more paranoia, we had no choice.



We didn’t talk much on the drive. Dale gripped the wheel, white knuckled, pale faced. James sat rigid, hands tucked under his arms as if he was trying to keep them from shaking.



And me? I listened, lost in a haze of fear and confusion.



The humming had changed. It wasn’t just a whisper, slowly, it became like music. With Notes bent, broken, twisting through the air like a sound that had never been meant for human ears, yet still alluring.



By the time we arrived, the moon sat heavy in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. The bridge loomed ahead, every shadow dancing in my mind.



None of us moved at first. Like we were waiting—for permission.



Then James let out a breath. “We go together.” Dale nodded stiffly.



I swallowed hard. “Yeah.”



And we stepped forward. Back into whatever this was we had stubbled into, whatever had never really let us go.

It felt as though the bridge let us in before we had the chance to change our minds.



The moment our feet hit the wood, the air shifted—thicker, heavier, like space was compressing around us. Everything sounded wrong, felt...wrong.



James sucked in a breath. “Do you feel that?”



None of us answered. We all felt it. Then, reality bled away.



Dale was the first to break.



His eyes widened, breath coming in short bursts as he reached for the side of his head. “No,” he whispered. “They’re inside—I can feel them, I can hear them!”



I turned toward him, stepping closer, but he screamed.



Not just a yell, a raw, primal shriek of terror.



“Get away!” He stumbled back, eyes locked onto something that wasn’t there. His hands twitched like he was trying to claw something out of his own skin.



James grabbed him, voice sharp. “Dale, it’s not real!”



But Dale wasn’t listening. Then James froze.



His face slackened, breath hitching as his gaze lifted toward the bridge, as if he saw something standing there, watching us.



His lips trembled. ""They're moving.""



And then was my turn.



The world fractured around me. The air bled. The bridge split open, spilling its rotted history out into the night.



And something crawled toward me. Not human. Not alive. A writhing puddle of limbs bent the wrong way, its mouth a gaping pit of blackened teeth, flies and maggots flowing out.



It lunged. I didn’t think, I couldn't, I just swung.



The force of the hit sent it sprawling. I didn’t stop, Terror, rage and delirium fueling me.



My fists landed, again, and again, crushing, tearing, breaking. It twitched beneath me, convulsed, cracked, final-



And then I blinked. The hallucination melted away.



And James lay beneath me.



Breathing ragged. Bleeding, Then he wasn't breathing at all. His body lay twisted, throat slack, eyes wide, yet unseeing.



Blood pooled beneath his cracked skull, soaking into the rotting wood. His chest didn’t rise, didn't fall, Didn’t move.



James was dead and it was my fault.



Dale was on his knees now, hands tangled in his hair, rocking slightly, whispering something, but his words I couldn’t be heard over the humming.



The bridge had taken James and we were still standing on it.



Dale moved before I could say anything.



One second, he was kneeling beside James’s body, face pale, hands shaking. The next, he was running.



Away from the bridge. Away from me.



“No—Dale, wait!” I scrambled to my feet, my pulse roaring in my ears. My hands were still wet with blood...James’s blood.



Dale didn't stop.



His breath came ragged, sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade as he ran toward the road. Toward the way out.



I didn't know what else to do, so i chased after him.



I could hear my own voice, raw, desperate. “Dale, listen to me—please! I didn’t mean to! I didn’t—”



He wasn’t listening. Then he slowed.



His footsteps faltered, his pace uneven, then he stopped completely.



I nearly crashed into him, gasping, grabbing his arm. “Dale, we have to—”



Then I saw it. The bridge was still in front of us.



Even though we had been running the opposite way, even though we should’ve left it [behind.it](http://behind.it) was still there.



Like we hadn’t moved at all.



Dale staggered back, shaking his head, his breath quick and shallow. “No—no, this isn’t right. This isn’t—”



My stomach turned as i whipped around, looking back the way we’d come—but it was the same.



Wooden planks stretching endlessly in both directions. No exit. No road.

 

Just the bridge and all around us, the humming grew louder.



Dale snapped.



The weight of everything, the hallucinations, the never ending bridge, James’s death, everything crashed into him at once.



He whirled around, his face twisted with rage and grief, his breath sharp, uneven.



“You killed him!” His voice was raw, cracking like something inside him had finally broken. “You—James is dead because of you!”



My heart dropped, a truth i refused to accept.



“I—I thought I was fighting....something” My words came out frantic, desperate, but Dale wasn’t listening.



""You always thought you were fighting something!"" Dale's hands shook, his body tense with something more than fear. Hate. Betrayal. Terror. ""Maybe it's YOU that’s the problem! maybe this place wanted you, not us!""



I flinched. the words i had thought hurt so much more to hear aloud.



Dale was breathing fast now, eyes darting wildly, his voice tearing through the air like a knife.



“You think I can ever forget what I just saw?"" he hissed. ""You think I can just live with this?!”



I moved toward him, hands raised, pleading. ""Dale, please—we have to get out of here, we have to—”



He shook his head violently, staggering backward, eyes glassy and frantic. ""There’s no way out!""



And then. we saw it. From the shadows of the bridge, something stirred.



A shape. A rotting, twisting thing, its limbs bent at unnatural angles, its flesh torn and leaking, bones jutting through in jagged, uneven splinters.



Its head tilted, too far, its mouth wrong. Breathing, Watching. Waiting.



But the humming, the damn endless, suffocating hum...was gone...



In its place, James’s voice.



""Come closer."" ""Don't left me."" ""You can’t leave too.""



A whisper. Soft, almost pleading, curling through the air around us, threading into our bones.



Dale froze, I couldn’t breathe, James was dead. we knew that. We saw it. i DID it.



But his voice didn’t care because now, it wanted us too.



Then the voices came all at once, an explosion of whispers, a chorus of the dead, words tangled and overlapping, crawling into our ears like rot.



""Dont leave us."" ""You belong here."" ""Come closer."" ""Make it right.""



Dale screamed.



He clutched his head, stumbling back, his breath ragged and sharp, his mind fracturing beneath the weight of voices that weren’t his.



“Shut up!” he gasped. “Shut up!”



But they wouldn't stop.



I tried to reach for him, tried to pull him back, but something had already tswisted or snapped within him.



His movements turned jerky, erratic. His pupils blown wide, unfocused, lost.



And then, the glint of metal, A pocket knife.



Dale lunged.



I barely moved in time, the blade sliced the air, narrowly missing my throat.



""Dale!"" My voice cracked, frantic. ""Stop! It's me!""



But was it Dale anymore? i couldn't be sure.



His breathing hitched, hands trembling, eyes wild and not his own.



""Fix it.""



""You crossed the bridge.""



""Don't leave us.""



The voices pushed him forward.



I grabbed at his wrist, forcing it away, but he seemed stronger now. Or maybe something else was inside him.



The struggle blurred, violent, desperate.



Blood. My own? His? Both?



The knife twisted, slipped from his grip, clattered onto the wood.



Dale staggered back, chest heaving, eyes flickering between recognition and something else.



I didn’t move.



Because now, the bridge was waiting.



Blood pooled at our feet.



I didn’t know whose at first. mine? his? both? but I felt it, warm against my skin, soaking into the decayed wood beneath us.



Dale staggered back, his breath coming in jagged gasps, eyes flickering between horror and realization.



I clutched my side, fingers pressing against the sharp tear in my shirt, the sting beneath it. I’d been cut, fairly deep.



But Dale, Dale was worse.



A gash ran along his arm, deep, trembling, red spilling between his fingers as he tried to press against it.



We stared at each other, shaken, ruined, Then Dale’s face collapsed.



His breath came faster, sharp and uneven, like everything inside him was unraveling all at once.



“I—I did that,” he stammered, voice broken. He shook his head violently, like he could erase what had just happened. “I hurt you. I hurt—”



His gaze flickered toward James’s body. The blood. The twisted, motionless shape.



“No.” Dale’s voice cracked. His hands trembled. “I didn’t—this wasn’t supposed to—”



I stepped forward, ignoring the sting in my side. “Dale, listen to me, we have to figure this—”



“How am I supposed to figure this out?!” His voice rose, tight, unhinged. “James is dead! I tried to kill you! I don’t—”



He cut himself off, his chest heaving, his hands gripping his own hair. His breath hitched.



And then, I saw the moment he decided.



The shift in his posture. The way his body stilled, false calmness in the moment.



“I can’t do this anymore.”



""Dale—""



His hands moved too fast, the knife flashed—



And then his throat was open.



The sound that escaped his lips was small, broken, not meant for the world to hear.



I lurched forward, catching him as his body buckled, dragging him onto my lap, pressing my hands against the wound—but it didn’t matter.



There was too much blood.



""Dale—Dale!"" My voice cracked, shook, choked on something that felt like glass in my throat.



His mouth moved, but the words didn’t come. His fingers twitched against mine, then went still.



The bridge watched.



The voices whispered.



And Dale, he was gone.

I felt the bridge breathe.



I was alone now, or maybe I never had been. Maybe I had always belonged here, just waiting for my turn.



James lay twisted where I left him.



Dale’s body was slack, broken, the knife still loosely in his fingers, his blood pooling in sick rivulets.



And me? I had nowhere left to run.



The moment Dale’s body went still, everything erupted. The whispers turned to screams.



James’s voice. Dale’s voice. A chorus of them. Layered, overlapping, raw, hateful. 



""You did this.""



""You killed me.""



""we’re still here.""



""You belong here.""



I clutched my head, pressing my palms against my temples, trying to drown them out, but no, it was inside me now.



They were inside me. Then the hallucinations ripped open.



James stood in front of me, neck twisted, his lips curled into something between a grin and a snarl.



His throat moved, but I saw the gash, the ruined flesh, the blood still dripping and spurting.



""I woke up in blood.""



Dale trembled beside him, his hands wrapped around his own throat, gasping like he was still trying to breathe.



""You did this.""



I stumbled away. no, no, no, they were dead, they were dead, they were dead!



And then, the bridge changed.



The planks beneath me twisted, rotted, pulsed. The air shifted, thick with something I could feel crawling into my lungs.



Everything bent, distorted, splintered apart until there was only darkness.



And the sound of laughter.



Not mine. Not Dale’s. Not James’s.



Something else. Something that had been waiting all along.



The bridge had taken everything.



James. Dale. Reality itself. I had nothing left, except the truth it was forcing me to see.



The voices didn’t stop. They slithered around me, wrapping into my thoughts, twisting into something that felt more real than my own skin.



""You never left.""



""You belong here.""



""This is where you stay.""



But then...blackness.



Everything tore away, I woke up somewhere else.



Cold metal beneath me. Bright lights overhead.



For a moment, I thought I was dead. that the bridge had finally finished what it started.



God no! the voices...wait



Real voices? Not whispers.



“…Found him wandering. Covered in blood-most of it wasn’t his.”



“…Two confirmed deaths. Dale and James. Killed on the bridge. But the way we found them—”



“…Rambling. Hallucinating. Won’t stop talking about the bridge.”



I realized a pressure around my wrists. Restrained. I twisted, blinking fast. White walls. Clinical air.



Not the bridge, but I was still trapped.



Weeks passed. Month perhaps? I didn't know because none of it was mine anymore.



The cops labeled it murder. The psychiatric evaluations labeled it delusion.



They didn’t believe me. Hell, They couldn’t believe me.



And now, I sit in a windowless room, retelling my story one last time.



My voice hollow, Distant, and at the end, when I had nothing left to say. I exhaled slowly.



Then, I reached for the only thing I had left.



A sharpened edge. One last choice. Before the bridge could take me back.

unclean dishes in sink? bad. clean dishes in dishwasher? still bad. condensation on my cup? gross. taking my frozen chicken nuggets out of their container to prepare? even worse. my stupid idiot dog (i love him so much but oh boy) pissing so far on the edge of the potty pad that he drags his dumbass peepee paws thru the kitchen and my big toe touches it before i realize? horrific. in fact im making this post because a similar incident just happened and i nearly went fucking nuclear cleaning it up. albeit that one is the worst example and objectively grosser to the point where i disinfect my feet and hands about it a few times. but i mean it all pushes me over the edge if it happens like rapid succession/multiple times.

similarly, i cant stand hot/warm liquid *in* my body either??? i hate feeling soups/coffees/teas going down the entirety of my esophagus. i only drink cold (and at best/reluctantly, lukewarm) drinks. i have a theory that maybe this is cuz the insides of your body are always warm and the outsides are cold in comparison so maybe my body starts tweaking out about equilibrium, but thats probably bullshit and im just in this cursed body forever with no reason.

1laviom,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1laviom/7_devils_bridge/,7 Devils Bridge,"South Carolina is full of ghost stories, most of them cheap thrills born of boredom or drunken dares for teenagers. But Seven Devil’s Bridge? That one stuck with me. Not because I believed in restless spirits or midnight curses, but because i was once one of those bored teenagers, and although i didn't see anything, i heard...something, I've regrated hearing ever since. I didn't believe in ghosts. I just enjoyed fear, and in a smalltown there wasn't much to do. So one day a few friends and I went to go see the Seven Devils Bridge.



The night we went to Seven Devil’s Bridge was thick with humidity, nothing new For South Carolina, it was often hot and humid. The air so still it felt like the world was holding its breath. The road leading up to the bridge was barely visible, swallowed by trees that loomed in from both sides, backroads upon backroads. My friends joked and shoved each other, their laughter sharp against the quiet, but I wasn’t laughing. I was listening, the air felt electric, and i felt something....different.



We stood on the bridge, waiting. The legend said that if you crossed at midnight, you wouldn’t make it to the other side. A lot of nonsense, I thought. Still, we were bored, and just wanted to get out of the house, this was supposed to be just another thing to do, to kill time. So I leaned against the rusted railing, staring down at the shallow creek below, waiting for something, anything to happen, to prove me wrong.



That’s when I heard it. A low cry? It was almost melodic, but broken, fragmented. 

Like sound whispering through static. My head snapped toward my friends, but they were still laughing, still shoving, completely unaware.



The sound twisted, shifting between notes, growing more distinct. Now just a hum. A voice? But the words were impossible to understand. My pulse hammered. I tried to shake it off, tried to tell myself it was the wind, the water below, some trick of my tired mind, but it was gone now, The wind blew gently, the slow flow of water in the creak droned, yet i didn’t move. The sound, whatever it was, now gone, but the feeling of being watched remained.



""what was that?"" i wasn't sure if i was asking myself, my friends or the air, my two friends looked at me amused.

""what are you actually getting freaked out?"" Dale asked, a smirk on his face, while James was dicking around on his phone....did i imagine it? 

Trying to shrug the overwhelming feeling of eyes on me i simply suggested we should go get a bit to eat on the way home, and we left, my friends still lulling about, i found myself antsy, slowing my walking to match there pace.

""get ahold of yourself pussy"" i remember telling myself before pushing my thoughts away as we drove away from Seven Devils Bridge





The drive home should have put it out of my mind. Dale and James kept up their usual antics, arguing over where to grab food, complaining about how dead the town was, but I barely heard them, there in body alone. I kept glancing at the rearview mirror, almost waiting to see something lurking behind us. Nothing. Just the empty road stretching into the night.



Then the first time I heard it again, I was alone.



It was the next morning, in my room, just before sunrise. That same sound, quiet as a hum, distant but impossible to ignore. My stomach twisted. I sat up, listening, holding my breath. It sounded closer now. Like it was inside.



I turned toward my closet, setting ajar, hadn't i closed it the night before? i couldn't remember, i couldn't be sure.

No. No way. I got up, slammed it shut. The humming faded slowly.



For a while, i just sat there, unsure of what i heard, then my alarm went off, I jolted up again as if just waking up, ""was that real...was i dreaming? the uncertainty bleeding reality into fiction. 



At school, it was worse. I was spacing out in class, (i was usually sleeping in class but i felt so wired) then i thought i heard it again. Not a cry this time. Words. Garbled, slipping between syllables like a language I knew but couldn't understand. I looked around but no one else reacted. I pressed my palms against my face, squeezing my eyes shut.



""Not real. Not real."" i thought like a mantra i could will into existence.



But when I opened them, my hands...they weren’t my hands.



They looked...wrong. Smaller? Thinner? Not mine. Not human?



I blinked, and they were normal again. A distant voice in my ear let out a sharp laugh before fading into nothing.



what i felt then wasn't just fear. i was frozen in place, the bell rang but i sat there, not moving till i heard the shovel of the next classes feet. i quickly got up, shaking, sweating, and darted out of the room and into the bathroom, after emptying my stomach and leaving the restroom i had one thought, ""Fuck This"".

Within the next 15 minutes i was getting into my friends old white chevy truck and we were peeling outta the parking lot, i remember thinking ""eh at least i showed up today"" to clarify i wasn't a great student.

For the next few days, life settled back into the usual haze of wasted hours and half-hearted decisions. No whispers. No voices. No twisted hallucinations.



I convinced myself it had all been some weird trick of exhaustion, or the mind, maybe both, maybe a leftover fear from that damn bridge. So I let it go. I spent the afternoons gaming with Dale and James, trash talking, losing track of time until the sky outside turned deep blue. I skipped school like usual, slept till noon, smoked just enough to keep reality soft around the edges.



It was easy to pretend nothing had happened. Then, it came back, like a distant hum, it came back.



I was at Dale’s place, leaned back on his busted couch, controller in hand, barely focused on some yet another match we were winning or losing. James was rolling a blunt, moaning about how expensive good weed was getting. just another day. A normal day.



And then—the hum. Low and fractured. The kind of sound you’d hear if someone was standing just behind you, breathing words through gritted teeth, something more primal than anger. I stiffened.



James flicked his lighter, exhaling smoke. Dale cursed at the screen. Neither of them heard it. life parading on around me.



I swallowed hard, eyes darting toward the darkened hallway leading out of the living room we called home. Something was standing there, just a shape. Unmoving. Wrong.



I stared. Blinked. Gone.



I exhaled slowly, forcing a smirk, forcing myself back into the game. This wasn’t real. It wasn’t i told myself.



I took a deep inhale, letting the smoke roll through my lungs, heavier than it should’ve been. Relax. That’s what I needed. That’s what I told myself.



Dale was still talking, something about his ex and how she was “certifiably insane.” James was focused on rolling another blunt, eyes lazily tracking the process like it was second nature. Everything was normal. I was normal. This was normal.



Then—the sound. Subtle. Weaving between the static of the TV in the background. Like a breath beneath the silence.



I froze. focusing on the sound, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Paranoia. Overthinking.



Then, the voice came, low, sharp, slicing through the air like a blade.



""You are not alone.""



I choked on my breath, coughing violently, nearly knocking the coffee table over as i shot up and stumbled.



James frowned at me. Dale paused mid-sentence.



""You good?"" Dale asked, raising an eyebrow. I tried to speak, but my throat was locked up, my heart hammering against my ribs. Not alone? What the hell did that mean?



My head snapped toward the hallway again...nothing. But I swore I felt something standing there, watching. Breathing.



I gripped the edge of the couch, my pulse thundering, the high suffocating me instead of calming me.



James flicked his lighter, eyes narrowing. “You sure your good bro? something up?”



I let out a sharp, nervous laugh. it felt loud and forced.



""Nah, man, shit just hit me harder than I expected,"" I lied, forcing a smirk, wiping sweat from my forehead.



I was not alone. And i silently hoped i was just losing my mind.



The tension had reached a breaking point. I wasn’t hiding it well anymore, i couldn't, the sleepless nights, the paranoia, the way I flinched at sounds no one else seemed to hear. Dale and James had started watching me, their jokes turning into quiet questions, uneasy glances. I could see it in their faces, they knew something was wrong.



Finally, James snapped.



“Look, man, what the hell is up with you?” he asked, blunt tucked behind his ear, arms crossed. “You’ve been losing your mind ever since we went to the bridge.”



Dale nodded, leaning against his truck. “Yeah. You ain’t exactly subtle.”



I opened my mouth to lie, to brush it off, but I couldn’t. swallowing the lump in my throat i simply asked



“You think it started there?” voice hollow.



James and Dale exchanged a glance.



“I Guess...That’s the only thing that makes sense,” Dale said. “You were normal before.”



That word normal, hearing it in the context hurt.



James exhaled sharply. “Then maybe we gotta go back.”



My pulse spiked. “What?”



He shrugged. “Think about it. Maybe it’s like… I don’t know. maybe going back will help you chill out.”



Dale shrugged. “fuck it why not?”



I wanted to argue, I really did. But the voice—the one that had been whispering in my ear for days—had said something, hadn’t it?



""Come back."" ""Fix it.""



Against every ounce of logic in my body, in cold sweat I agreed.



Seven Devil’s Bridge looked different this night.



We stood at the edge, headlights casting long shadows over the cracked pavement, the quiet suffocating from all sides.



Dale was tense. James was still trying to act casual. But I? I felt sick.



“I don’t get it,” Dale muttered. “What are we even supposed to do?”



James shrugged. “See if something happens.”



I exhaled slowly, stepping forward. The air felt wrong, like the pressure had shifted. My hands shook, but I shoved them into my hoodie pockets. I had to do this.



Then, the humming began. Not distant this time. Not faint. Loud. Surrounding us. Wrapping around us like a silent beast.



Dale cursed, stepping back. James stiffened. They heard it...they HEARD IT!



Then we saw them. Seven figures. Hanging from the bridge.



Still. Twisting. Watching. crying.



Dale moved first.



A strangled sound escaped him, something between a scream and a curse, but he didn't stop to process what he was seeing. He ran.



James followed, stumbling backward, dragging me with him. His grip was tight, nails digging into my wrist, pulling me toward the truck like he was afraid the ground might swallow us.



Yet I hesitated. Not because I wanted to stay, but because the figures had turned their heads toward us.



Seven sets of hollow, bloodshot eyes, locked onto mine. Their swollen maggot filled mouths twisted, open but not speaking, tongues blackened and shriveled from the noose around their throats. But I heard them anyway.



""Come back."" ""left us."" ""Fix it.""



Then one of them moved.

e rope, a wet, tearing  gurgling sound filling the air.



Everything became a blur, before i knew what i had done I ran.



The truck door slammed behind me, Dale fumbling with the keys, James breathing hard beside me. The engine roared to life, the tires kicking gravel as we sped away, the bridge shrinking in the distance.



But the voices never faded, becoming a constant hum.



By the time we reached town, Dale’s hands were shaking too much to hold his phone, and James had gone silent—just staring at the road ahead, eyes wide, unblinking.



I sat in the back, gripping my knees, pulse hammering. Because even though we had left...I could still see them.



Now, they weren’t just at the bridge. They were everywhere.

A violent jerk, body convulsing against the rope.



The bridge never let us go. after that second visit, after we saw those...things, everything got worse. The air around us felt heavier, like we were dragging something unseen everywhere we went.



At first, I thought it was just me. The noises hadn’t stopped. It followed me home, curling beneath the sound of my breathing, hiding under the flicker of my bedroom light.



Then James called.



“I saw it again,” he whispered. “The bridge. But I wasn’t there. I was in my room, but when I blinked I-I was hanging from it.” Then Dale was next.



He slammed his palms against the hood of his truck one afternoon, shaking his head like he was trying to wake up. “I keep seeing them..Everywhere. In the mirror. Outside my window. In the backseat when I drive. They don’t move...but they’re watching.”



And me? I was drowning in it. The hallucinations weren’t just flickers anymore. They were vivid. Brutal.



I couldn’t tell if I was awake or dreaming, because every time I blinked, I saw them die, at times, seeing US die.



The first man—he kicked. Struggled. His fingers clawed at the rope around his neck, body convulsing as blood pooled behind his eyes.



The second. Silent. Motionless. Accepting the fate she'd been given.



The third screamed, a raw, splintering sound that tore through my skull, his mouth twisted open as if the air had been ripped from his lungs.



And the rest, they watched me.



Even as they hung—the stares burned into me. 



I gripped my desk, panting, choking on air, the classroom around me collapsing into static. Dale and James were looking at me.



They knew. Because now, they had seen it too.



The days after the second visit blurred into something fractured. None of us could hold onto reality the way we used to.



Yet I wasn’t alone anymore. Now, Dale and James heard them too.



The voices had spread like an infection, crawling into our lives, twisting in ways none of us could ignore. And the hallucinations were worse.



after me, James saw them after.



It was late, maybe two in the morning, when he called. His voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.



“They’re here.”



I sat up, gripping my phone. “Where?”



“My room.” His breath hitched. “Hanging. From the ceiling.”



A hollow silence stretched between us. I tried to think, maybe he was just seeing it, just reliving the moment, but then, his voice cracked.



“They’re moving this time.”



I couldn’t respond. Because I knew James was right.



It wasn’t just frozen images anymore. They were changing. Shifting. Growing closer, i had seen them as well.



Then Dale had his turn.



I met up with him a few days later, standing outside his truck, the air thick with weed smoke and something wrong.



“I can’t look in my mirrors anymore,” he muttered, staring past me, eyes red-rimmed and dry. “Every time I do, I see one of them behind me.”



I swallowed hard. He dragged a hand through his hair. “I think it’s getting worse.”



And I knew he was right. Because now, they weren’t just hanging from the bridge.



They were hanging from us. 



The unraveling was slow, but inevitable, I should’ve seen it coming.



One day sitting in Dale’s truck, parked behind the abandoned gas station on the edge of town. a regular hang out spot for us, James was jittery, legs bouncing, knuckles tight around a half-smoked cigarette. Dale was eerily still, staring ahead, barely blinking.



The silence between us felt wrong, uncomfortable, heavy, suffocating, buzzing with something we couldn’t name.



Then Dale twitched. A sharp inhale. Fingers curling into fists. His jaw locked.



“Dale?” I frowned, shifting toward him. “You good?”



He didn’t answer. Instead, his head snapped toward James, eyes wide, wild, like he didn’t recognize him.



And then, he lunged.



James barely had time to react before Dale’s hands were around his throat, knocking him back against the passenger door.



“Dude!” I shouted, scrambling to pull him off.



James choked, gasping, nails digging into Dale’s arms, struggling to push him away, but Dale’s grip tightened.



His eyes weren’t normal, they were bloodshot, blown wide, like something else was looking through them.



And then he spoke. though it wasn’t his voice.



""You crossed the bridge."" ""You left us there."" ""Why did you leave?""



My stomach dropped.



I grabbed Dale, yanking him back with everything I had, forcing him against the seat, pinning his wrists.



James coughed violently, sucking in air, shaking all over.



Dale blinked fast—something snapped back into place. His face crumpled, realization hitting like a freight train.



“Oh my God,” he whispered. His whole body trembled, eyes darting between me and James. “I—I didn’t mean to—I don’t know what—”



James was still catching his breath, rubbing his throat. His expression wasn’t angry. It was terrified.



Dale’s hands trembled as he reached for James, stopping short. both were terrified.



“I don’t know what happened,” he breathed. “I swear to God, I wasn’t—I don’t even remember—”



None of us knew what to say. Because deep down, we knew the truth. It wasn’t Dale.



Not really.



The next week passed in a haze of frantic research and uneasy silence.



None of us wanted to talk about what happened in the truck. Dale afraid to ask for forgiveness, and would James even accept it? We moved carefully around each other, conversations clipped, tensions hanging in the air like fog.



But the whispers never stopped.



James buried himself in old news articles, digging through anything that mentioned Seven Devil’s Bridge. He found scraps, bits of folklore, missing persons reports, vague warnings dating back decades.



Dale spent nights glued to his laptop, scrolling through conspiracy forums, desperate for anything that felt familiar. And me? I was lost, just listened.



Slowly the voices were changing.



""You don’t belong."" ""you never left. ""Fix it.""



The more we searched, the worse it got as time passed, Reality slipped.



And then James woke up wrong.



I got a call at dawn, his voice shaking, not normal, not James.



“I—I don’t—” His breath came sharp, clipped, uneven. “There’s blood in my bed.”



I sat up fast, heart hammering, the fog of sleep washing away quickly. “What?”



“I-I...don’t know where it came from.” His voice cracked. “I....don’t know if it’s mine.”



Something cold settled in my stomach. ""Did he-no....no""



Dale and I rushed over.



James was waiting for us on his porch, skin pale, pupils blown wide like he hadn’t slept. He led us into his home, slowly, reluctant.

It dawned on me that he hadn't been inside since our call.



The sheets, soaked. Rust-colored, thick, too much blood for one person.



But James had no wounds, Nothing at all, Nothing on him. And the worst part?



When Dale pulled back the blankets, there were handprints.



Seven of them. Smudged into the fabric, fingers long, warped.



close but not human, i swear i saw claw marks, but couldn't be sure.



James sat on the floor, shaking, staring at his hands like they weren’t his. “I don’t—I don’t remember falling asleep.”



Dale swallowed hard. “maybe you didn’t?”



None of us had an answer, because now, it wasn’t just hallucinations anymore.



It was real, and we couldn't differentiate reality from fiction anymore, reality and ""fiction"" were melding together. 



Desperation led us back.



After a week of finding nothing, no explanations, no answers, just more paranoia, we had no choice.



We didn’t talk much on the drive. Dale gripped the wheel, white knuckled, pale faced. James sat rigid, hands tucked under his arms as if he was trying to keep them from shaking.



And me? I listened, lost in a haze of fear and confusion.



The humming had changed. It wasn’t just a whisper, slowly, it became like music. With Notes bent, broken, twisting through the air like a sound that had never been meant for human ears, yet still alluring.



By the time we arrived, the moon sat heavy in the sky, casting long, jagged shadows across the cracked pavement. The bridge loomed ahead, every shadow dancing in my mind.



None of us moved at first. Like we were waiting—for permission.



Then James let out a breath. “We go together.” Dale nodded stiffly.



I swallowed hard. “Yeah.”



And we stepped forward. Back into whatever this was we had stubbled into, whatever had never really let us go.

It felt as though the bridge let us in before we had the chance to change our minds.



The moment our feet hit the wood, the air shifted—thicker, heavier, like space was compressing around us. Everything sounded wrong, felt...wrong.



James sucked in a breath. “Do you feel that?”



None of us answered. We all felt it. Then, reality bled away.



Dale was the first to break.



His eyes widened, breath coming in short bursts as he reached for the side of his head. “No,” he whispered. “They’re inside—I can feel them, I can hear them!”



I turned toward him, stepping closer, but he screamed.



Not just a yell, a raw, primal shriek of terror.



“Get away!” He stumbled back, eyes locked onto something that wasn’t there. His hands twitched like he was trying to claw something out of his own skin.



James grabbed him, voice sharp. “Dale, it’s not real!”



But Dale wasn’t listening. Then James froze.



His face slackened, breath hitching as his gaze lifted toward the bridge, as if he saw something standing there, watching us.



His lips trembled. ""They're moving.""



And then was my turn.



The world fractured around me. The air bled. The bridge split open, spilling its rotted history out into the night.



And something crawled toward me. Not human. Not alive. A writhing puddle of limbs bent the wrong way, its mouth a gaping pit of blackened teeth, flies and maggots flowing out.



It lunged. I didn’t think, I couldn't, I just swung.



The force of the hit sent it sprawling. I didn’t stop, Terror, rage and delirium fueling me.



My fists landed, again, and again, crushing, tearing, breaking. It twitched beneath me, convulsed, cracked, final-



And then I blinked. The hallucination melted away.



And James lay beneath me.



Breathing ragged. Bleeding, Then he wasn't breathing at all. His body lay twisted, throat slack, eyes wide, yet unseeing.



Blood pooled beneath his cracked skull, soaking into the rotting wood. His chest didn’t rise, didn't fall, Didn’t move.



James was dead and it was my fault.



Dale was on his knees now, hands tangled in his hair, rocking slightly, whispering something, but his words I couldn’t be heard over the humming.



The bridge had taken James and we were still standing on it.



Dale moved before I could say anything.



One second, he was kneeling beside James’s body, face pale, hands shaking. The next, he was running.



Away from the bridge. Away from me.



“No—Dale, wait!” I scrambled to my feet, my pulse roaring in my ears. My hands were still wet with blood...James’s blood.



Dale didn't stop.



His breath came ragged, sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade as he ran toward the road. Toward the way out.



I didn't know what else to do, so i chased after him.



I could hear my own voice, raw, desperate. “Dale, listen to me—please! I didn’t mean to! I didn’t—”



He wasn’t listening. Then he slowed.



His footsteps faltered, his pace uneven, then he stopped completely.



I nearly crashed into him, gasping, grabbing his arm. “Dale, we have to—”



Then I saw it. The bridge was still in front of us.



Even though we had been running the opposite way, even though we should’ve left it [behind.it](http://behind.it) was still there.



Like we hadn’t moved at all.



Dale staggered back, shaking his head, his breath quick and shallow. “No—no, this isn’t right. This isn’t—”



My stomach turned as i whipped around, looking back the way we’d come—but it was the same.



Wooden planks stretching endlessly in both directions. No exit. No road.

 

Just the bridge and all around us, the humming grew louder.



Dale snapped.



The weight of everything, the hallucinations, the never ending bridge, James’s death, everything crashed into him at once.



He whirled around, his face twisted with rage and grief, his breath sharp, uneven.



“You killed him!” His voice was raw, cracking like something inside him had finally broken. “You—James is dead because of you!”



My heart dropped, a truth i refused to accept.



“I—I thought I was fighting....something” My words came out frantic, desperate, but Dale wasn’t listening.



""You always thought you were fighting something!"" Dale's hands shook, his body tense with something more than fear. Hate. Betrayal. Terror. ""Maybe it's YOU that’s the problem! maybe this place wanted you, not us!""



I flinched. the words i had thought hurt so much more to hear aloud.



Dale was breathing fast now, eyes darting wildly, his voice tearing through the air like a knife.



“You think I can ever forget what I just saw?"" he hissed. ""You think I can just live with this?!”



I moved toward him, hands raised, pleading. ""Dale, please—we have to get out of here, we have to—”



He shook his head violently, staggering backward, eyes glassy and frantic. ""There’s no way out!""



And then. we saw it. From the shadows of the bridge, something stirred.



A shape. A rotting, twisting thing, its limbs bent at unnatural angles, its flesh torn and leaking, bones jutting through in jagged, uneven splinters.



Its head tilted, too far, its mouth wrong. Breathing, Watching. Waiting.



But the humming, the damn endless, suffocating hum...was gone...



In its place, James’s voice.



""Come closer."" ""Don't left me."" ""You can’t leave too.""



A whisper. Soft, almost pleading, curling through the air around us, threading into our bones.



Dale froze, I couldn’t breathe, James was dead. we knew that. We saw it. i DID it.



But his voice didn’t care because now, it wanted us too.



Then the voices came all at once, an explosion of whispers, a chorus of the dead, words tangled and overlapping, crawling into our ears like rot.



""Dont leave us."" ""You belong here."" ""Come closer."" ""Make it right.""



Dale screamed.



He clutched his head, stumbling back, his breath ragged and sharp, his mind fracturing beneath the weight of voices that weren’t his.



“Shut up!” he gasped. “Shut up!”



But they wouldn't stop.



I tried to reach for him, tried to pull him back, but something had already tswisted or snapped within him.



His movements turned jerky, erratic. His pupils blown wide, unfocused, lost.



And then, the glint of metal, A pocket knife.



Dale lunged.



I barely moved in time, the blade sliced the air, narrowly missing my throat.



""Dale!"" My voice cracked, frantic. ""Stop! It's me!""



But was it Dale anymore? i couldn't be sure.



His breathing hitched, hands trembling, eyes wild and not his own.



""Fix it.""



""You crossed the bridge.""



""Don't leave us.""



The voices pushed him forward.



I grabbed at his wrist, forcing it away, but he seemed stronger now. Or maybe something else was inside him.



The struggle blurred, violent, desperate.



Blood. My own? His? Both?



The knife twisted, slipped from his grip, clattered onto the wood.



Dale staggered back, chest heaving, eyes flickering between recognition and something else.



I didn’t move.



Because now, the bridge was waiting.



Blood pooled at our feet.



I didn’t know whose at first. mine? his? both? but I felt it, warm against my skin, soaking into the decayed wood beneath us.



Dale staggered back, his breath coming in jagged gasps, eyes flickering between horror and realization.



I clutched my side, fingers pressing against the sharp tear in my shirt, the sting beneath it. I’d been cut, fairly deep.



But Dale, Dale was worse.



A gash ran along his arm, deep, trembling, red spilling between his fingers as he tried to press against it.



We stared at each other, shaken, ruined, Then Dale’s face collapsed.



His breath came faster, sharp and uneven, like everything inside him was unraveling all at once.



“I—I did that,” he stammered, voice broken. He shook his head violently, like he could erase what had just happened. “I hurt you. I hurt—”



His gaze flickered toward James’s body. The blood. The twisted, motionless shape.



“No.” Dale’s voice cracked. His hands trembled. “I didn’t—this wasn’t supposed to—”



I stepped forward, ignoring the sting in my side. “Dale, listen to me, we have to figure this—”



“How am I supposed to figure this out?!” His voice rose, tight, unhinged. “James is dead! I tried to kill you! I don’t—”



He cut himself off, his chest heaving, his hands gripping his own hair. His breath hitched.



And then, I saw the moment he decided.



The shift in his posture. The way his body stilled, false calmness in the moment.



“I can’t do this anymore.”



""Dale—""



His hands moved too fast, the knife flashed—



And then his throat was open.



The sound that escaped his lips was small, broken, not meant for the world to hear.



I lurched forward, catching him as his body buckled, dragging him onto my lap, pressing my hands against the wound—but it didn’t matter.



There was too much blood.



""Dale—Dale!"" My voice cracked, shook, choked on something that felt like glass in my throat.



His mouth moved, but the words didn’t come. His fingers twitched against mine, then went still.



The bridge watched.



The voices whispered.



And Dale, he was gone.

I felt the bridge breathe.



I was alone now, or maybe I never had been. Maybe I had always belonged here, just waiting for my turn.



James lay twisted where I left him.



Dale’s body was slack, broken, the knife still loosely in his fingers, his blood pooling in sick rivulets.



And me? I had nowhere left to run.



The moment Dale’s body went still, everything erupted. The whispers turned to screams.



James’s voice. Dale’s voice. A chorus of them. Layered, overlapping, raw, hateful. 



""You did this.""



""You killed me.""



""we’re still here.""



""You belong here.""



I clutched my head, pressing my palms against my temples, trying to drown them out, but no, it was inside me now.



They were inside me. Then the hallucinations ripped open.



James stood in front of me, neck twisted, his lips curled into something between a grin and a snarl.



His throat moved, but I saw the gash, the ruined flesh, the blood still dripping and spurting.



""I woke up in blood.""



Dale trembled beside him, his hands wrapped around his own throat, gasping like he was still trying to breathe.



""You did this.""



I stumbled away. no, no, no, they were dead, they were dead, they were dead!



And then, the bridge changed.



The planks beneath me twisted, rotted, pulsed. The air shifted, thick with something I could feel crawling into my lungs.



Everything bent, distorted, splintered apart until there was only darkness.



And the sound of laughter.



Not mine. Not Dale’s. Not James’s.



Something else. Something that had been waiting all along.



The bridge had taken everything.



James. Dale. Reality itself. I had nothing left, except the truth it was forcing me to see.



The voices didn’t stop. They slithered around me, wrapping into my thoughts, twisting into something that felt more real than my own skin.



""You never left.""



""You belong here.""



""This is where you stay.""



But then...blackness.



Everything tore away, I woke up somewhere else.



Cold metal beneath me. Bright lights overhead.



For a moment, I thought I was dead. that the bridge had finally finished what it started.



God no! the voices...wait



Real voices? Not whispers.



“…Found him wandering. Covered in blood-most of it wasn’t his.”



“…Two confirmed deaths. Dale and James. Killed on the bridge. But the way we found them—”



“…Rambling. Hallucinating. Won’t stop talking about the bridge.”



I realized a pressure around my wrists. Restrained. I twisted, blinking fast. White walls. Clinical air.



Not the bridge, but I was still trapped.



Weeks passed. Month perhaps? I didn't know because none of it was mine anymore.



The cops labeled it murder. The psychiatric evaluations labeled it delusion.



They didn’t believe me. Hell, They couldn’t believe me.



And now, I sit in a windowless room, retelling my story one last time.



My voice hollow, Distant, and at the end, when I had nothing left to say. I exhaled slowly.



Then, I reached for the only thing I had left.



A sharpened edge. One last choice. Before the bridge could take me back.



Am I crazy? Or was the bridge real? either way i still hear the distant, alluring hum, inviting me home.",1,1749860814.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

We used to live in Back Bay and the South End, and we are really hoping to get back to that urban feel after spending too many years in the very car-dependent South. That being said, our work requires us both to split our time between the city and beyond, and our schedules don't align so we will both need to have our cars. We are looking for a location that is compatible with both of our commutes to work, which get complicated...

Partner 1 will be splitting time between Longwood and Waltham. Cool with public transit, LMA shuttles, or walking for Longwood days. Has parking over there so could drive if needed, but prefer alternatives. Would love a short commute to Longwood.

Partner 2 will be mostly working in Cambridge (""between Harvard and Inman Squares"") and sometimes further north of the city. Needs a car.

Neighborhoods we've been looking at:

* Back Bay (mostly toward the Mass Ave side and St. Botolph neighborhood)
* South End (not too far south or east though)
* Fenway??? This actually seems like the most convenient location to be based out of but who lives there? What is the vibe? All students? Loud? Any intel on living in the tall buildings there?
* Cambridge? We don’t know the neighborhoods well, but I've seen that there's an LMA shuttle down Mass Ave. Would love to hear where to focus.
* Brookline (close to LMA)? Although I haven't been impressed with any listings there.
* Where are we missing?

Mid-30s DINKs - prefer the city to suburby feel. Convenient highway access is important but we’d love something walkable with access to restaurants, coffee shops, and good shopping. Open to professional buildings, individual units, or word-of-mouth leads. 

We're looking for 2 bedrooms, 1+ bath would be great, in-unit laundry is a must, cat friendly, and well-sized and up-to-date interiors. Parking on-site or available to rent for at least 1 car - could street park the other.

BUDGET - I have been looking and WOW rent prices have gone up while we've been away. Trying to be realistic - is this all possible for around 6K a month? We can stretch it by 1-2K to include additional parking and utilities, etc. if needed but 6K is doable for sure.

1lavhge,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1lavhge/vent_about_friends_lifes_unfair/,"Vent about friends, life's unfair","I (F37) didn't wanna hijack the other person's topic about hating friends. Wanted to write a comment there, but this comment turned into a rant. So yeah, now I'm just venting, cause honestly, I really needed to get this off my chest, because it's been bothering me for a long time. And I just want to scream it out into the abyss.

I hate having friends. I have my boyfriend and my mom and that's enough for me. 

I rather have acquaintances, but I have no need for friends. I will go out and have a coffee with people, or eat lunch or watch a movie and hang out for a day, but I don't need the every day calling or chatting, or Facebook birthday wishes. I seriously wish I could turn off my inbox messages. 

I hate it when people like me. I'm always very clear about that I'm not looking for new friendships at all. But then they pry and force themselves into my life anyway. Asking me why I haven't replied to their Instagram message. Because I don't want friends, that's why. And I don't want to be on insta 24/7. Just because I want a place to post my concert pictures, doesn't mean I want to chat with people, or that I'm avaliable as soon as i receive a message. I never open my inbox anyway. Sometimes I talk to people, but after a while I ghost them. Mostly because I'm too lazy to reply, or because I don't wanna be on my phone typing for hours when I could have just played some nintendo in peace. I enjoy being alone and spend my time in silence. 

I'm an asshole when it comes to keeping friendships. I show no interest in other people's lives. I have no need to hear about their problems. And just really don't care about anything they want to say. But.. I don't wanna completely talk bad about myself. I'm an asshole, but I'm not a fucking asshole. I will show respect, give advice when they ask. Help them if they can't do something, that I can. I will pay for the coffee or lunch if they can't afford it and I will always, absolutely always, come to their birthday party with a good gift. I hug, kiss (being social and shit) and never say a bad word about them. 

What pisses me off most, is that my boyfriend is an extrovert with adhd. He NEEDS friends to survive. He becomes deeply depressed when he has no one to hang out with or when he gets bored (that's the adhd). He absolutely needs to chat with people, go outside and watch a sports game, or whatever, you know. He's the sweetest guy I've ever been with. If any of his friends need help, he will always be there. He'll do anything for anybody. He's an absolute angel. But he gets dumped constantly by his ""friends"". He meets random people at a basketball game, festival or through other people and he's got no problem talking to literally everybody. He exchanges phone numbers on the first day of meeting them. But then.. they chat with him for a short period of time, ask for help or use him for his money and/or kindness and then just never reply anymore. And my boyfriend will be left devastated, rejected, feeling unwanted. It breaks my heart. To see him like that. Wishing he had friends to hang with and talk to. 

It's so unfair. I want to be left alone, my behavior should chase people away from me, yet they still want to be my friends. And my boyfriend, so sweet and fun, he gets nobody? 
Seriously, what is that?? 

Sorry for the too long post. Wasn't meant to be this long. But if any of you guys read it all, I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart that you wanted to listen to my feelings. 

Don't get me wrong, eventhough I have no interest in friends, I am extremely empathic and care deeply about other people. Sometimes a little too much. I am polite and always treat people with respect. If you would get to know me in real life, you'll see I'm a nice girl with a good heart that's just been betrayed one too many times. 

It's 2 am, time for bed. Good night all. ",0,1749860710.0,introvert,1,0.5,False

On their last mission a team of astronauts brought back what appeared to be a from a plant gathered off a lush jungled planet. Other specimens of this plant had been studied in her space station before, but this was the only one of its kind ever grown from seed. These plants reached maturity very fast so as the team botanist it was her duty to monitor and report every change to the specimen.  If Reese’s calculations were correct, the otherworldly flower should be blooming any second.

As Reese waited in eager anticipation, she looked over reports from encounters with the other flora and fauna of the planet. The local fauna of the planet was aggressive towards humans, however not in the way any scientist could have predicted. Many of the creatures of the planet seemed to feed off substances commonly found in the discharge of both human male and female genitalia. There were rumors of a patrol that lost contact on the planet, and they were captured by a group of extraterrestrials and used as sex slaves to feed them. While many of the crew members aboard the space station joked around the coffee pot about how lucky they were, behind closed doors, everyone was unsettled at the idea of this being a planet full of a very different type of predator.

Unpleasant thoughts aside, Reese was on the verge of a scientific discovery like none other. She leaned in close as she watched the flower’s blue bulb slowly unfurled, spreading its shimmering petals. Much to her surprise, the blooming flower revealed what looked to be a small, tightly wound, slug buried deep within the flowers center. Reese couldn’t believe her eyes and gently held the flower towards the light, turning around to try to find a camera to document her discovery. However, when she looked back towards the flower, the slug-looking creature had vanished. Had she imagined the slug existing to begin with? She looked at the clock and realized she had been staring at the plant for hours so maybe her tired eyes only thought she saw a slug when in reality she was only looking at the shockingly moist interior of the plant.

She sent a message to the science board to let them know the flower had bloomed. While she waited for her superiors to schedule the meeting she began documenting any changes to the flower, reviewing her notes, and trying to figure out how to present all her findings.

When the flower bloomed, there was in fact a small alien creature. As it woke up it was exceptionally hungry and needed to find a food source. Luckily for the alien slug, Reese didn’t seem to notice as it slithered inside her lab coat sleeve as she was turned around. While Reese was trying to plan her presentation, the alien slug began slithering down her shirt. The alien was moving towards the nearest food source, Reese’s tight little pussy.

Reese stood in front of a boardroom full of her coworkers and superiors. She was so nervous she could feel herself sweat; she noticed an unusual wetness between her legs but ignored it figuring it was just her nerves.

“As you can see, the ability of *Floros Xenos* to grow and bloom in an earth like atmosphere and oxygen levels is unlike anything we could have predicted.”

While she gave her presentation she could feel a strange tingling sensation between her legs, it felt as if a tiny tongue was trying to eat her out but couldn't quite find her clit. It was an odd sensation as she couldn’t imagine what could be the cause of it.

Nearing the middle of her presentation the strange feeling between her legs grew unignorable. Whatever strange alien had crawled down her underwear had found its way to her clit. With an outer lip covered in tiny barbs, the alien latched itself under her clitoral hood, her entire clit enveloped in the slug like creature’s mouth. The mouth itself had numerous tongues evolved specifically of causing the pleasure of its host.

As the alien’s tongues swirled around her most sensitive area Reese couldn’t help but hold back a faint moan.

“What was that Dr. Shusett?”

Reese grabbed onto the table trying to keep herself from collapsing, all the pleasure was making her knees weak.

“Dr. Shusett are you alright?

Reese let out a loud moan of pleasure as she fell to the floor.

“Get the medical team over here STAT, Reese just collapsed”

Reese began to writhe on the ground in complete bliss. It got lonely up on their space station, she hadn’t felt pleasure like this in a long time. As the creature continued licking, she could feel her brain fogging as the pleasure took over.

“Alien” she gasped, “there was an alien in the flower.”

This caused a stir in the room. Was something like this even possible, the only think Reese was working with was a flower. Could a life form be born from the flower?

The extraterrestrial slug continued doing exactly what it had evolved to do. The thing twisted its numerous tongues around her swollen clit causing mind breaking pleasure seemingly without end. Reese continued writhing around on the floor, moaning out in delight, grasping for anything to hold onto to hold herself afloat in a sea of pleasure. The medical response team rushed in, but it was all a blur of sights and sounds to Reese who was moaning uncontrollably. She stuffed her hands down her pants trying to pull the orgasm inducing slug off her clit, but the tiny barbs had already dug into her soft flesh. Trying to remove the alien only tightened its hold on to her tenderness and caused further stimulation. Even though Reese realized the creature wasn’t going anywhere she continued to pull on the slug’s body to stimulate herself even more, desperately hoping to achieve a sweet orgasm.

Reese was loaded on to a gurney, arms and legs restrained to the rails as she thrashed about. The medical team cut away her pants with their trauma shears reviling the bright blue alien, stuck between her legs. Upon being seen the alien paused its relentless licking, giving Reese a moment to comprehend what was going on. She watched in horror was her peers and superiors ogled her half naked form. She felt tears well up in her eyes with how utterly humiliated she felt. She clenched her eyes tight, pretending her colleagues weren’t still staring at her. Someone threw a thin blanket over her allowing her some privacy. However much to her horror, the dark atmosphere seemed to be the signal to the slug to keep licking again. Before the pleasure took over her, she noticed that the medical team wasn’t taking her to the station clinic, it was taking her to the research labs.

All during the ride to the labs the alien lapped at her clit, always bringing her right to the edge then stopping. She curled her toes and arched her back in frustration. Balancing right on the brink of pleasure was maddening. She gripped at the cart rails and tugged at her restraints. She thrust her hips up in the air as if that would provide any additional stimulation. She felt as if only a strong breeze was required to push her over the edge into complete and utter pleasure, but nothing came. To make matters worse, she could feel that her pussy was soaking wet. Her juices were dripping down her legs and creating a wet spot on the cart beneath her. Reese was an embarrassing over stimulated mess.

Reese finally rolled into the research lab, as she thrashed about the extraterrestrial biology team managed to get her into a straight jacket. She was then put in the middle of a blank room with bright lights shining down on her, much to her relief causing the alien to stop licking at her. As the pleasure faded, she was able to fully comprehend what was happening, she had been strapped to the far wall and was facing a mirror that was no doubt a viewing window. *Great instead of helping me they’ve made me into one of their lab rats,* Reese thought. While she her top half was covered by the straight jacket, she was naked from the waist down. She could see the alien creature wriggling between her legs and that she was standing in a pool of her own wet juices. Reese had never been more humiliated in her life but at least the lights seemed to calm the alien. She hated the biology team for using her as an experiment instead of helping her. Just as she thought the biology team couldn’t have subjected her to any more torment, the lights in the room began to darken.",1,1749860638.0,Forest_Creature,0,1.0,False

Hold it right there, you thief! Stop before I make you breathe your last breath!"" My sharp voice cut through the cold night air as I chased after the bastard who had just mugged me. This day could not get any worse. My uncle had forbidden me from leaving for Starlight City until my eighteenth birthday, when I transformed into a wolf for added protection, but I didn't heed his warning. I ran away. Ten years of training, waiting, hunting—and he wanted me to stay behind like some feeble pup? No. Fuck that. But now I was here, starving, wounded, and broke if I didn't catch this douchebag. The thief was quick, and I could tell he had his wolf with him, but I was swifter. However, my legs burned as I leapt over a fallen tree trunk, narrowing the gap. His mistake was thinking he could steal from me and get away with it. With a flick of my wrist, I drew a dagger and sent it soaring. The blade sliced through the air, burying itself deep into his calf. He let out a scream, stumbled, and fell onto the dirt. A cruel smirk crept onto the side of my lips. Bingo, bastard. I didn't slow down. I was on him in seconds, pinning him to the ground. ""You think you could just stab me and blow some sleep powder in my face and steal my things? ""Bad idea,"" I panted, tugging his head back. ""Now, give me my bag."" The guy groaned, struggling beneath me. ""Girl... please, ah, my hand—"" he groaned out as I yanked his hand back. And then I heard the sound of a machine as something flickered in my periphery—a motorcycle. I turned my head just in time to see a guy swing off his sleek black bike, tying a helmet to the handlebars. But what caught my attention most was his hand—wrapped in a black bandana embroidered with a nightshade thorn. My breath caught. Everything else—the thief, the pain in my ribs, the cold—faded. It was him. One of them. One of the bastards who had destroyed my home, my pack, and taken everything from me was present.

My fingers dug into the thief's shirt, my rage boiling over—but before I could react, he saw his chance.

With a desperate grunt, he twisted beneath me, shoving me off with force. I stumbled back, managing to avoid the tree and catching myself on my hands and knees.

By the time I looked up, the thief was gone.

I cursed, but I didn't chase him because I had found something else—something far more important. I staggered to my feet, ignoring my spinning vision, and followed him—the bike guy.

Just a two-minute trek and he led me into the city's underbelly, deeper into the neon-lit streets, until we reached a nondescript alleyway.

At the end stood a hidden bar, its entrance guarded by two burly men who barely spared him a glance before stepping aside.

'A secret place, huh? Maybe his gang was there,' I thought. My gaze darted to the injury at my side. I touched it, and my hands were stained with blood. I bit my inner lips, and I didn't hesitate.

Shaking my hair, I was glad my all-black outfit blended with such a place. I slipped inside, melting into the shadows.

The moment I stepped in, heat and music crashed into me like a wave.

Bodies swayed on the dance floor, grinding, twisting, and shifting. The aroma of alcohol, sweat, and raw dominance thickened the air.

And then—I saw him.

At the far end of the bar, his face half-lit by flickering neon, the same cruel smirk I remembered from ten years ago.

My pulse spiked. Anger coursing through me but before I could take a step, my vision blurred.

Something was wrong.

A slow, creeping numbness spread through my fingers and up my arms. Suddenly, my legs felt heavy and unsteady and my stomach twisted.

I had been poisoned.

How… the thief? Urgh! I swear he would pay, I cursed under my breath.

All I knew was that I needed to get to the other guy now before my body gave out.

I pushed forward, shoving through the dance floor, ignoring the bodies pressing against me.

Too late, I realized how clumsy my movements had become as the swaying bodies shoved me from side to side till I tripped—and crashed into someone at the other end of the dance floor

Hard.

And then I felt him sniff and stiffen. ""No doubt, my blood gave me away."" 

A sharp, cold voice sneered above me. ""Who let this dirty, dried-up little pumpkin into this club?""

I blinked up, disoriented, with pain lancing through my skull.

The man standing before me was tall and broad, exuding raw dominance. His cyan-blue eyes gleamed with amusement and disgust. He was attractive, golden-blond, and had a bad attitude.

I attempted to push away, but then two more figures closed in, trapping me—but no one else appeared to take any notice yet.

One possessed red hair and hazel green eyes, while the other had raven-black hair and emerald-green eyes that blazed with raw, unfiltered power.

Fuck.

Their aura slammed into me all at once, forcing my already weakened body lower.

The poison was working too fast, thanks to my earlier running and my loss of blood. And now I was trapped.

The red-haired guy tilted his head, his smirk widening. ""Well, sweetheart? Got anything to say?""

I forced my chin up, ignoring the tremor in my limbs. ""Get out of my way.""

The first guy chuckled, the sound low and sharp. ""Bold words for a wolf who can barely stand.""

The last guy didn't laugh.

He simply watched me with quiet, lethal intensity, one I would know as I gave those stares but this… it sent a shiver down my spine, like I had entered the lion's den.

I tried to move, but suddenly—heat.

My scent hit me like a slap.

Fuck.

My pheromones.

My body was betraying me. The combination of the poison and their suffocating aura was making me lose control.

Instantly, their expressions shifted from amused dominance to disgust. The red-haired guy's nose scrunched. ""Trying to seduce us, little wolf?""

The first guy scoffed. ""Pathetic little slut.""

The last guy's jaw ticked. ""Control yourself, will you, or you will get more trouble coming to you.""

As he said that, his gaze drifted to the others in the club, and this time, I realized I was becoming the center of attention. 

That's when I realized it. I stilled.

My hand flew to my chest. My necklace. It was gone.

Shit.

The one thing that had helped mask my scent and helped suppress my pheromones was gone.

""Shit,"" I cursed out loud.

They just stared at me. I masked my fear. ""Get out of the way, douche."" I tried to push up, to force my body off the floor and escape this onslaught of scent, but their aura crushed me again.

I gasped, choking on the pressure.

The first guy crouched beside me, gripping my hair and yanking my head back, so I had no choice but to meet his cold, piercing gaze and then the last guy leaned in.

""You've got quite a bad mouth on you given your situation. Apologise now,"" he murmured, ""and maybe we'll go easy on you.""

Never. My eyes blazed with anger but that was all I could do as I felt the numbness spreading. And then, the first guy did it again, unleashing his wolf's aura even more.

My chest tightened as I spat blood onto the floor. ""You three just made the worst mistake of your lives.""

The second guy grinned. ""Oh? And why's that?""

I forced a weak, broken smirk. ""Because you've just entered my death note.""

They laughed. All three of them. Dark, cruel, and unbothered. I shook my head, trying to keep my vision clear, but things were becoming blurred.

The last chap, the one with black hair, leaned in, his lips just a breath away from my ear.

""If you survive long enough, I'd love to see you try, little wolf.""

Then, just as fast as they appeared, they straightened, turned and left, leaving me collapsed on the floor—humiliated, burning with rage, and promising myself one thing.

""Oh, I'll do more than just try, you bastards,"" I said through gritted teeth. 

With them gone, I could move now. Immediately, I pushed past the onslaught of people and dashed out of the club. I needed to be far from them—their scents—and not make myself easy prey.

But just as I entered the forest once more, my limbs gave way and I collapsed as the poison fully took effect, paralyzing me.

**CHAPTER 2**

Pain. Heavy, unrelenting pain coursed through my body, especially my head.

My body felt like lead, my limbs numb, my throat dry. I groaned as consciousness dragged me back, the morning sun stabbing through my closed eyelids like knives.

What the hell…?

My pulse pounded against my skull, and the sharp scent of damp earth and blood filled my nose. My blood. My fingers twitched against the dirt, and slowly, I forced my eyes open.

The forest canopy swayed above me, golden sunlight spilling through the leaves. Birds chirped in the distance, oblivious to the fact that I had almost died last night.

I sucked in a shaky breath. The poison. It had worn off, but my body still ached from the aftermath. I tried to sit up, hissing at the sting in my ribs. My wounds had stopped bleeding, but I needed to clean them before they got infected.

My fingers fumbled for my phone, only to see that a part of the screen had cracked. I hissed as the screen flickered to life, but then fate was after me—1% battery.

Shit.

My first instinct was to call my uncle. He'd be pissed, but at this point, I didn't have much of a choice. I quickly pressed his number, bringing the phone to my ear, but before I did, the screen went dark.

""Dammit,"" I cursed loudly.

I clenched my jaw, but then I remembered—my smartwatch.

Yes!

Tapping the screen, I activated the call function to my emergency contact and waited. One ring. 

Two.

Then, a sharp, familiar voice crackled through the speaker.

""Valerie Violet Sapphire Snow.""

I winced. My uncle only used my real full name when I was in trouble. 

Having run away from home, used a dangerous means of transport while turning off any means of being tracked, got attacked, poisoned and also caused him to worry—right now, I was indeed in trouble.

""Morning to you too, Uncle.""

A long silence. Then, a heavy sigh. ""I warned you. I fucking warned you, Valerie!""

""Temper, temper, temper, Uncle. I know,"" I muttered in Scar's voice. ""I wouldn't dream of offending you."" I held back the need to chuckle, as I could already see the scowl forming on his face. ""But you also know why I couldn't wait.""

Another pause. This one lasted longer.

Finally, his voice softened just a little. ""Where are you?""

""Somewhere outside the city. Got mugged, poisoned, and nearly crushed under three oversized alphas.""

A beat of silence. ""The... the alpha princes?""

I blinked. ""I… my eyes were blurry thanks to the poison, but I doubt they are as scumbagish as those bullies.""

A sharp inhale. ""Doesn't matter. You need to get somewhere safe and go to school which you would have been doing if you hadn't run away from home. Where are you now?""

""Outskirts of the city.""

""Okay. There's a hotel on Crescent Street. Lobby 2. Go there now. I'll handle the arrangements.""

I exhaled in relief. ""Got it.""

""Valerie."" His voice turned serious. ""Be careful. And stay the hell away from trouble.""

Too late for that.

But I didn't say it.

Before the call ended, I recalled one crucial detail. ""Uncle.""

""Yes?""

""I lost my necklace.""

This time, the silence was deafening. I knew he was holding back his rage. A sharp exhale followed. 

""Valerie…""

""Please, can you get me another one?""

""The witches aren't that free. But I'll pull a few strings. Sorry, but it wouldn't get to you on time, so I advise you to stay low. Do not attract attention to yourself.""

""Got it.""

The call ended, and I pushed myself to my feet, wincing at the tight pull of my wounds. I needed to move.

The hotel wasn't far—an hour from where I was—but every step felt like dragging my body through fire. The city was alive now—cars honking, voices buzzing, and the scent of food teasing my empty stomach.

I reached the building, a sleek, modern structure standing tall against the skyline. The lobby was cool, quiet and smelled like expensive cologne.

And then—I saw him.

A familiar face.

The man stood near the front desk, dressed casually in dark jeans and a fitted shirt, but there was no mistaking him. A contact of my uncle.

He glanced up, and the second our eyes met, he smirked. ""You look like hell, Nightshade.""

""Feel like it, too,"" I muttered. ""Hello, Gamma.""

""Is that all I get after seeing each other for five years?""

My smile broadened as I immediately gave him a hug. He was one of those who trained and spoiled us in my uncle's pack.

Without another word, he handed me a brown envelope. I opened it, finding a stack of cash, a debit card, and a hotel key.

""Shower, eat, sleep,"" he said. ""You look like you're about to drop dead.""

""I love the encouragement."" I snatched the envelope. Then I quickly recalled something: ""Oh, and Ryan, I need a new phone and laptop. I need to track someone.""

""I'll have it sent to your room, Nightshade.""

""Always the best."" With that, I stalked toward the elevator, leaving him.

The hotel room was clean and classy, and the scent of fresh linen filled the air. I wasted no time stripping out of my torn clothes and stepping under the hot shower's spray.

The moment the water hit my skin, I exhaled.

Flashes of last night flickered in my mind—the thief, the poison, them.

Were they the Alpha Kings' Heirs?

Dristan. Kai. Axel. I thought the four heirs usually moved together.

I couldn't recall, as the poison and the loss of blood did a number on me.

All I recalled were their voices, scents and suffocating aura pressing down on me like a weight I couldn't shake.

'Pathetic little slut.'

'Apologize now, and maybe we'll go easy on you.'

I gritted my teeth, shoving the memories aside. No. I wouldn't let them win.

After dressing my wounds and slipping into the clean clothes left for me—black jeans, a fitted top, and combat boots—I grabbed my bag, which contained my laptop and new phone. 

Then I saw a folded note and opened it. ""Stay out of trouble, Nightshade,"" I read out and glanced at the phone number on the back.

That was his hotline, for me.

Smiling, I headed out.

It was time to get to school.

The moment I stepped onto the Prestige Supernatural Academy grounds, I felt it.

The weight of eyes. The thick, electric buzz of power.

PSA wasn't just a school. It was a battlefield.

Students walked in groups, whispering and exchanging glances. Werewolves, vamps, and even a few fae—the exchange students—were all mingling, sizing each other up.

I inhaled as I asked someone for directions to the principal's office.

Since my delay, I have arrived on lunch break. I was epically late.

Then, a shift in the atmosphere.

A ripple of tension.

I caught murmurs, hushed voices speaking in awe.

""The Alpha Princes are arriving.""

I immediately stilled. I didn't know if they were the one, but the dangerous aura I felt made my skin prickle. I swallowed hard as the aura drew closer. 

It… was them, alright. 

Slowly, I turned toward the entrance gates. And there they were.

Three figures, walking in perfect unison. 

""It's Alpha Dristan, Alpha Kai and Alpha Axel,"" a fangirl chimed behind me, and I rolled my eyes.

Looking every bit the arrogant, untouchable kings they thought they were.

This time, my vision was clear. No poison fogging my mind. No disorientation. And now that I could fully see them, I wondered how the hell I hadn't noticed it yesterday.

Dristan. Kai. Axel.

The three arrogant bastards who had humiliated me in the club now stood at the entrance of Prestige Supernatural Academy, oozing power like they owned the damn place.

Dristan's cyan-blue eyes flicked lazily over the crowd. Kai's emerald gaze burned with dominance. Axel? Smirking like he owned me.

I had half a second to slip away unnoticed—

""You.""

Fuck.

I froze, exhaling slowly before turning back. All three of them locked onto me within two seconds.

Axel's smirk widened. ""Well, well. Look what we have here.""

Kai tilted his head. ""Seems like the puny wolf found our den. Back for more fun?""

Dristan? He just watched, unreadable, calculating. Waiting for God knows what.

Heat curled in my gut, but I swallowed it down.

I forced a smile. ""Oh, please. The only thing fun about last night was not breathing your disgusting aura when you left.""

A hush fell over the crowd. Gasps. Murmurs.

""Did she just—?""

""She must have a death wish.""

Kai's jaw ticked. Dristan's gaze darkened. Axel chuckled, shaking his head.

And then Dristan spoke, voice smooth, controlled—too controlled. ""Watch your mouth, slut.""

The word cut through the air like a blade. Sadly, before I could react, his finger hooked under my chin, tilting my face up, forcing me to look at him.

The moment his skin met mine, a sharp jolt of something hot and infuriating shot through me.

Several gasps echoed from the students loitering around.

But Dristan had made one mistake. He thought I'd let him.

Instead, I smacked his hand away.

Shock flickered across his face before something darker replaced it. ""You just made a mistake,"" Dristan murmured, his voice deceptively soft.

""Did I?"" I tilted my head, my expression blank, but my pulse was racing.

Kai let out a low chuckle, stepping forward. ""You're new here, so I'll give you a chance to rethink that attitude.""

I snorted. ""Oh, how generous.""

Axel exhaled a laugh, shaking his head. ""You've got a smart mouth, sweetheart."" His hazel-green eyes glinted with amusement. ""Shame if someone decided to do something about it.""

Dristan's cold stare didn't waver. ""You're in our territory now. You don't make the rules here.""

My stomach twisted at the possessiveness in his voice, but I refused to let it show.

Kai's smirk stretched wider. ""But don't worry. We'll make sure your time here is... interesting.""

Something about the way he said it sent a shiver down my spine.

But I ignored it. I exhaled, bored. ""Right. You guys have your whole 'we rule the school, fear us' act down, but I'm not impressed.""

Gasps again. A few whispers.

From the corner of my eye, I saw a group of cheerleader types lingering by the entrance. Lip Gloss Barbie from earlier stood in front, arms crossed, nose scrunched like she smelled something rotten.

""Who the hell is she?"" she sneered, flipping her hair. ""Does she even know who she's talking to?""

Another girl, a brunette in heels way too high for school regulations, snickered. ""Bet she's just some stray trying to act tough. News flash, sweetheart—you don't disrespect the Alpha Princes and walk away unscathed.""

A few others laughed, clearly entertained by the idea of me getting put in my place.

Typical.

I rolled my eyes. ""I'm sorry—do you have a script for this, or is it just a natural-born lack of originality?""

The brunette gasped. Lip Gloss Barbie's eyes flashed with irritation.

""Know your place,"" she spat.

Before I could respond, Dristan cut in.

""Let it go, Brielle.""

Brielle. So that was her name.

She immediately backed down, shoulders stiff, eyes downcast.

I snorted. ""Wow. Do you keep all your pets this obedient?""

Kai stepped closer, his broad frame blocking the morning sun. ""You've got some nerve, talking like you're untouchable.""

I shrugged. ""And so what?""

Axel let out a low whistle.

Dristan's gaze sharpened. Kai's expression darkened.

Instead of avoiding trouble like I had been advised, I lifted my head, glaring daggers at all three. ""Buzz the fuck off.""

Shock and something akin to anger flashed in their eyes, but before either of them could react, I shoved past Axel and disappeared into the academy.

And I knew, without a doubt, that this year at Prestige Supernatural Academy was about to be hell.

'Fuck them… bring it on, Alphas.'

**CHAPTER 3**

After dealing with the three insufferable Alpha Princes, I just wanted to register, get my schedule, and survive the day without more bullshit.

No such luck.

As soon as I entered the principal's office, the principal's secretary hardly glanced up at my arrival, her fingers tapping away at her computer with a look of boredom.

""The principal isn't in today,"" she said, flicking her gaze over me. ""You'll need to come back early tomorrow morning to complete your orientation.""

I frowned. ""Wait. My uncle was supposed to—"" I paused when I realised I said that out loud.

She sighed, already knowing where I was going with this. ""I assume your guardian was supposed to call in advance and explain your circumstances?"" she asked as though she had heard those excuses before.

Still, I exhaled sharply and nodded. Of course, he forgot,or was this intentional as a way of punishing me?

Tsk… that old man could be a big bully sometimes.

""Right. Well, I was…""

""Sick? That's not my concern,"" she interrupted briskly.

""No. I was mugged and stabbed on my way here yesterday. Getting to school or in touch with my family wasn't easy after that."" Her expression fell completely. She wasn't expecting that, especially when I lifted my shirt to show her the wound.

She gasped. 

""So if there are any forms I need to fill, Ms. Heart—"" I lifted my eyes from her name tag and smiled expectantly.

""I'm sorry about everything."" Her attitude changed immediately. ""I just had a rough day. You should also have the doctor check that out, okay?""

I nodded, and she went shuffling through some papers before handing me a neatly stacked pile. ""That's it. Here's your timetable and classes, as well as a brochure containing the school rules and a map of the academy.""

I took them without a word.

""Your name?""

""Valerie. Valerie Nightshade."" 

Ms. Heart gave me a once-over, then smirked. ""You're a straight-A student, which is the only reason we allowed a senior-year transfer. We don't usually do that, but your dad drove a hard bargain.""

She winked at me.

I forced a smile back. Dad?

If my father were alive, I wouldn't be transferring.

If the assassination ten years ago never happened, I wouldn't have to prove myself in this hellhole.

Because just like those spoilt Alpha brats, I was entitled to be here—all Alpha heirs were.

I swallowed the thought and nodded before leaving the office with a thanks.

The rest of the day was thankfully Alpha-free.

I skimmed over my schedule, relieved to find out I had two more classes before the school day was over. Thankfully, none of the alpha heirs were there.

Unfortunately, I wasn't free of Brielle and her cheer minions.

They were in my Economics and Advanced Geography classes, sitting front row, preening like they were the main characters in a shitty high school drama.

I kept my head down, ignoring the glares thrown my way.

But then, as I settled into my seat, a strange feeling washed over me.

A pair of eyes settled on me. I glanced around subtly, but I did not catch the culprit. I didn't need more unwanted attention today.

But something told me this school wouldn't let me stay in the shadows for long, especially those cheer bitches. So, before anyone made a move, I left the class after the lecturer.

By the time I reached the dorms, exhaustion weighed on me. The stares—whispers—Alpha Princes. I just needed a moment to breathe.

A soft chime from my smartwatch lit up the screen.

\[Welcome to PSA Student Housing: Room 318\]

I found the door, twisted the knob, and stepped inside.

Damn.

I expected a cramped dorm. Instead, I walked into a spacious suite—a vast common area that stretched before me, complete with a sleek sectional couch, a massive flat-screen TV, and a low coffee table. 

To the right, an open-concept kitchen gleamed with dark countertops and modern appliances, a dining table with four chairs neatly tucked in the corner.

But what caught my attention the most? Four separate doors—two evenly spaced along the walls and the other two in the opposite wing. Each one had a gold nameplate.

I moved closer, scanning the nameplates. Four names—Emerald Drake, Astraea Kane, Isla Storm and Valerie Nightshade.

I pushed open the door—and stopped.

It was perfect.

The room was exactly as I had requested: deep blues, purples, and blacks. It had a massive bed, a plush comforter, floor-length curtains, and a sleek desk in the corner.

I opened the closet.

Three sets of four uniforms, tailored for each season. Light fabrics for spring and summer and thicker materials for autumn and winter.

On the lower shelf, neatly folded, were a pyjama set and necessities. 

""Good. My stolen bag isn't an issue for now.""

For the first time since arriving at PSA, I felt a little relief. The rest of this school might be hell. But at least this room was mine.

I dropped onto the bed, exhaling.

Tomorrow, I'd deal with everything.

My dorm room had a view of the dense forest surrounding the academy.

I spent most of the evening settling in, even though my roomies were nowhere to be found. I stepped out later to get something to eat before returning. 

Finally, I took my bath, and exhaustion took over. I had barely crashed an hour when my new phone rang out, and I immediately took it from my nightstand.

I answered. ""Yeah?""

""Valerie,"" my uncle's voice came through. ""The Blood Moon is tonight. You need to get as far into the forest as possible before it rises.""

I stiffened. Shit.

My first transformation was going to be today, once the clock struck midnight.

I had spent years training and preparing, but that didn't change the fact that this would be my first time fully shifting and meeting my wolf.

""You sure I can't just lock myself in here?"" I muttered, already knowing the answer.

""You need space. Your wolf will take over, and you won't be able to control her at first."" A beat of silence. ""Go now.""

I sighed. ""Fine.""

After ending the call, I grabbed a hoodie and slipped out of the dorm, heading toward the school gardens and forest.

It was already late and most of the dorm room lights were turned off. Good. I could sneak out.

The moment I stepped into the cool night air, something inside me stirred. I swallowed, looking up at the full moon. 

Without being told, I hurried and headed straight into the forest. The more I ran, the quicker the colour above began to change. 

And as soon as the clock struck 12, the moon was completely red. 

I made it deep into the forest, my body burning, my bones breaking—shifting. I let out a strangled breath, falling to my knees as the first wave of the transformation hit.

And then—burning heat.

My body snapped, stretched, and reshaped. Pain and power intertwined as my vision blurred, my skin burnt—until suddenly, I wasn't standing on two legs anymore.

I was on four.

My wolf had fully awakened.

The forest around me seemed taller but my senses were razor-sharp. Every scent, every sound, every pulse of life—I could feel it all.

And my reflection in the fountain nearby? A massive silver wolf, streaked with violet and blue along her fur, glowing eyes burning with power.

I took a breath. I was finally complete.

And the whole damn world would know it soon enough.

Just as I was about to howl, a strange, unique voice echoed at the back of my mind. ""Hello, Valerie. I am Astra, your wolf.""

The Next Day—Principal's Office

I grabbed my schedule and a fresh set of uniforms, feeling a little more put together after dressing up. I didn't bother checking for my roommates either because the time on my watch said 8:20—I was late.

By the time I got to the academy the next morning, I was exhausted but steady. The shift had drained me, but I had managed to regain control.

Until I stepped outside.

And felt it—something was off. Astra, my wolf, was restless.

My muscles tensed and my senses were on high alert. Maybe it was the aftermath of my first shift. Maybe my pheromones were still out of balance.

I pushed forward, shaking off the unease. The principal's office it is. That was my priority.

But then—I reached a T-junction in the hallway, three different corridors ahead of me.

The second I turned down the first—red hair, hazel-green eyes and a cocky stance that made my blood boil, came into view. 

My body froze.

Axel.

No. Not now. I could not deal with them.

If this was just my pheromones reacting, then I had to get the hell out of here before this scum-spoilt brat thinks I am seducing him. 

Too late because the next second, he lifted his head and his eyes darted in my direction.

I spun, taking the second turn—and this time, I locked eyes with Kai.

His emerald gaze flickered in recognition, his lips parting slightly as if he could sense it, too. And God knew I prayed he did not sense my pheromones.

Panic spiked through me. The more my fear rose, the stronger the pull. Heat surged beneath my skin.

Astra growled in my mind.

No. No. No.

I took the only escape left—the third hallway—and collided with him.

Dristan.

Cold. Unforgiving. The deadliest of them all.

A breath hitched in my throat as his cyan-blue gaze locked onto mine, sharp and calculating.

At the same time, I backed away and as if on cue, they moved in.

Axel, Kai, Dristan. Closing in. Blocking every exit.

I felt it before I saw it.

The shift in the air. The invisible snap between us.

Then, recognition.

Their expressions darkened at the same time mine did, realization slamming into all of us at once.

And then, like a cruel, twisted echo, their wolves roared in unison with mine.

""Mate.""

""No. No. No,"" I screamed internally.

I refused to acknowledge it.

But the second the word left their lips, their scents overwhelmed me. Axel's musky spice, Kai's dark cedar and Dristan's crisp frost and smoke.

It wrapped around me, sinking into my lungs, and clouding my mind. Taking over.

The bond was real.

I took a slow, shaky breath, my entire body thrumming with heat, betrayal, and fury.

Dristan's hand shot out, reaching for me, but I bolted, slipping past them. 

I sprinted down the hallway, ignoring the way my entire body burnt, ignoring Astra's furious protests in my head.

I didn't stop.

Not until they were far behind me.

Not until I could breathe again.

Because if I stayed a second longer, I wasn't sure if I'd kiss to claim or kill them.

**CHAPTER 4**

I had survived my first day at PSA without committing murder.

Barely.

Today wasn't going to be any different. I had chanted in my head many times as I made my way to the principal's office. 

It wasn't just the three insufferable alphas I now shared a mate bond with—the entire school was buzzing with my name.

Everywhere I walked, I felt the stares—the whispers.

""She's the one who mouthed off to the Alpha Kings' heirs.""

""Didn't she collapse after they hit her with their aura?""

""How is she even still alive?""

""She should have dropped dead immediately after talking to the Alpha Gods of PSA.""

""Who let someone like her in here? Heard she used special favours to get in at this time.""

Some of the wolves eyed me with curiosity, others with amusement. But the majority? They were pissed.

Because I had defied their kings.

Too bad for them—I wasn't here to bow. Keeping my head high, I walked past them to the principal's office.

As much as I wanted revenge against those spoilt brats, I still had to be a student. One who needed to maintain her straight A's.

\~Principal's Office\~

It was time for my official registration.

Upon entering, Ms. Heart beamed at me and gestured towards the office. ""You are in luck. She is free now. You may enter.""

I dipped my head in courtesy and walked towards the door. Inhaled briefly before turning the doorknob. 

The room was spacious and modern, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the academy's vast training grounds. Principal Whitmore, a middle-aged woman with a sharp gaze, barely glanced up as she stretched her hand to me.

""Good morning, Mrs. Whitmore.""

""Principal Whitmore,"" she corrected sharply as I handed over my documents.

I managed to flash my trademark smile, which I used to escape punishments from my uncle, when she looked up for a second and she rolled her eyes, sighing. 

She glanced at my document, her lips lifting at the corner. 

Wait, did she just smirk?

My question was answered for me following her next sentence. ""You've already made quite an impression, Miss Nightshade,"" he mused, flipping through my file.

I didn't respond. Just crossed my fingers in front of me and waited.

Her lips twitched in amusement. ""As far as your impulsiveness is commendable against you know who, try to stay out of trouble,"" she said the last phrase in a softer tone but suddenly her firmness returned. ""PSA may be a school, but it's also a pack's territory. You'd be wise to remember that.""

""Noted,"" I said flatly.

""Especially when you are this far from home."" 

Was that a warning?

""Prestige Supernatural Academy is many things and above all, comes with its own allure and distraction. If you want your straight A's not to have a flaw, you must do well to remember its rules.""

""Yes ma'am.""

""Good. Always remember curfew. Stay on the right side of the school's law and you and I wouldn't be seeing each other often.""

""Absolutely, ma'am,"" I responded almost too quickly, like I had rehearsed it. She shot me a look, one that could freeze her enemies but for me... I smiled. 

""Dismissed.""

Without saying much, I turned on my heels, opened the door, and exited her office. When I stepped out, Ms. Heart beamed and informed me that my textbooks would be waiting for me in my room when I closed from school. 

""Oh, and Valerie,"" she used my name this time, making me half turn. ""Pay a visit to the doctor's office.""

Without thinking much, I thanked her and left. However, I opened the door to leave—only to stop dead.

Leaning casually against the wall outside, waiting, were the three bastards that were my mates.

Dristan, Kai, and Axel.

I clenched my jaw. Fucking great. How the hell did I not sense them earlier on? Not like there was anything I could do now except walk and ignore them. 

I tried, but Kai blocked my exit, and all three of them had me pinned.

Dristan was the first to speak, his cyan-blue gaze cool and unreadable. ""Took you long enough.""

Kai's emerald-green eyes flickered with challenge, his arms crossed over his broad chest.

Axel? Smirking, like always. ""You look like you missed us, sweetheart.""

I scoffed, shoving past them. Luckily, I succeeded. ""Get out of my way.""

Axel tsked, falling into step beside me. ""That's not how things work here, sweetheart.""

Kai stepped in front of me, effectively blocking my path, and his broad frame radiated dominance, while Axel leaned in, annoyingly close, his smirk barely masking the tension in his hazel-green eyes.

Dristan stood just behind them, his icy cyan gaze locked onto me like a puzzle he couldn't solve.

Their emotions—anger, frustration, confusion—rolled off them in waves. But it wasn't just them.

Their wolves were restless.

And so was mine.

Astra snapped to attention the moment they closed in, pacing inside me like a caged animal.

""Mate. Mate. Mine.""

Her growl rumbled through my mind, my body heating in response.

""No."" I gritted my teeth, shoving her down. ""Stand down, Astra. We don't want them.""

""You don't."" She snarled. ""I do.""

My fingers curled into fists. Traitor.

Axel exhaled a slow breath, eyes flicking over me like he was seeing me for the first time. ""You feel it too, don't you, sweetheart?""

I forced a cold smile. ""Feel what? The overwhelming urge to kick you in the face?""

Kai wasn't amused. His jaw clenched, the muscles in his arms tightening. ""What the hell did you do to us?""

I blinked. ""Excuse me?""

Dristan stepped forward, his expression sharp and unreadable. ""Did you curse us?""

I stared. Then, a laugh bubbled out before I could stop it. ""You think I wanted this?""

Dristan's rage snapped. His palm slammed against the wall beside me, the sound echoing down the hallway.

I flinched. Not from fear—from shock.

The hallway went silent and a few stares were sent in our direction.

Their wolves pushed forward, eyes flickering between human and beast. Even Astra stilled, her instincts tangling with theirs.

Dristan leaned in, his eyes locked with mine as his deep baritone questioned, ""Does it look like we're playing?""

I turned my gaze to all three of them.

For once, they weren't cocky. They weren't smirking. They were serious.

They wanted answers. My heart thudded, but I met his glare head-on, scoffing as I shoved down the unease curling in my stomach.

""Why…"" I started off slowly but kept my voice sharp, ""—don't you take your jerk faces and go ask the Moon Goddess?"" My pulse was raging.

Kai's growl vibrated the air. Axel's smirk was gone.

I pressed on. ""Not like I want to be bound to a bunch of spoilt brats, either. So do us all a favour and let's just reject each other. That way, I can have my peace of mind.""

A low growl built in Dristan's chest, his wolf's fury bleeding into his stance. His hands twitched, like he was fighting the urge to grab me.

Astra whined, the bond pulling tighter.

I gritted my teeth, shoving her down again. ""You don't want them. They're arrogant, insufferable, egotistical dollopheads!""

But the second I thought it, I realized I had said it out loud.

Dristan's growl deepened.

I lifted my chin, glaring at him. ""What? Mad because I said it first?""

He took a step closer, his presence suffocating. ""You don't—""

A blur of movement. It happened so fast as someone shoved him aside. I barely had time to process what was happening before a hand gripped mine.

""And she's mine. Get in line, boys."" A girl, bold, confident, and fearless, called after herself.

She shot the Alphas a wink—then yanked me away.

**CHAPTER 5**

The grip on my wrist was firm but not forceful as the girl dragged me down the hallway.

I barely had time to glance over my shoulder—just enough to catch the shock and irritation flashing across Dristan, Kai, and Axel's faces before we turned a corner, leaving them behind.

Well. That was satisfying.

""Not that I'm complaining,"" I said, matching the girl's pace, ""but who exactly are you?""

She finally slowed, flashing me a wicked grin. ""The person who just saved your ass.""

I arched a brow. Bold. I liked her already.

She let go of my wrist and tossed her blonde curls over her shoulder. ""Isla Storm. Alpha heir of the Golden Crescent Moon Pack.""

Ah. That explained the confidence, I thought, but as soon as it did, I blinked before staring at her. 

She either did not figure it out yet or she, like these rich kids, didn't bother, but she was my roommate, the room next to mine.

She studied me like she was assessing something. ""You're Valerie Nightshade, right?""

I exhaled. ""The one and only.""

Her smirk widened. ""Figured. You're all anyone's talking about. And now? You just made history, babe.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Oh, let me guess. Because I dared to breathe in the presence of the Alpha Kings' heirs?""

Isla snorted. ""Yes and no."" I arched my brow, expecting her to explain and she did. ""Because you somehow managed to get all three of them to claim you as their mate.""

Her smirk widened, and I could see the glee in her eyes. Huh, a wild one.

I scowled. ""Against my will.""

She laughed. ""Oh, I believe you. But trust me, rejecting them won't be that easy.""

I wanted to ask how she knew, considering she wasn't close to us when Dristan snapped, but I figured as werewolves, they all had sharp senses, and some were way sharper than others. 

I narrowed my eyes. ""Why not?""

Isla crossed her arms. ""For one? The bond is strong. You might feel like you hate them now, but the longer you resist, the worse it'll get. And second?"" She tilted her head. ""Those three don't lose. Ever. And they sure as hell won't lose their mate.""

I groaned. ""They can fight over me all they want. I'll be long gone before they win anything.""

Isla chuckled, but her gaze turned more serious. ""Just… be careful, Nightshade. The mate bond is powerful, but so is everything else in this school. You don't have to like them, but don't underestimate them.

1lavdnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lavdnc/the_thing_behind_my_shoulder/,The Thing behind my Shoulder,"It all started with a broken laptop. It happens to a lot of people, but the fact that it happened to me, on that very day, at that very time, seemed like God giving me the finger. I was 45 minutes away from holding my first ever public speech at a shareholder meeting, and all my notes were gone. The slideshow was uploaded and ready, but my speaking points had gone the way of Jimmy Hoffa.

The IT guy, Armand, was frantically trying to work his magic; but it was gonna be down to the wire. He had to stop to wipe his hands with wet wipes every few minutes or so, costing me precious seconds. I had cold sweats seeping through my corporate pantsuit. I reminded myself to keep my arms down so they couldn’t see my sweat marks. My hair was already a mess, with long brown strands sticking to my cheek no matter how straight I held my neck.

“I’m sorry,” said Armand. “The problem is the hard drive. Everything else works fine. I can put in a new one and get it to boot, but your files are gone.”

He threw his hands up in surrender, and I almost cried. I didn’t want to do this damn presentation to begin with.

“Good luck,” he sighed. “I’ll keep my eye out for a better one.”

I stepped out on stage with little to no prep to a crowd of 460 of our most influential and prosperous investors. Everyone in that crowd could hire or fire ten of me without batting an eye. But I was greeted with courteous applause and tired smiles, all veiled behind a blinding spotlight. The headset chafed against my ears. Finally, the slides came on, and I just winged it. It was awkward, earnest, and burned a hole straight through my stomach. I tasted stomach acid for the rest of the day.

The moment I finished I dashed offstage and locked myself in the bathroom for a solid 20 minutes. I could hear people coming to check on me, but Armand was quick to redirect them to get me some space. It was done, but I felt awful. And on top of all of that, I was still expected to appear for the after-work. Drinks and smiles, like I was supposed to pretend these people didn’t practically *own* me.

But it is what it is. I put on the dress and the earrings; and suffered in silence.

 

I was never that good with people. I was a sick kid who mostly played with words. My mom came from this small hippie compound in rural Minnesota, so she was used to having a small group to spend her time with. She didn’t exactly encourage me to explore the wide world. I didn’t just hear about stranger danger, I heard about razor blades in Halloween candy, rat poison sprinkled on wild raspberries, brain parasites in unfiltered rainwater, and that eating sunflower seeds would make you mentally ill – especially the blue ones.

So yeah, not really a people person. I still have this reaction to step back when someone approaches me. It’s imprinted in me, like the steps to a dance. And my mom’s ever-present worry solidified as this nagging voice in the back of my head, ready to bring me down whenever I thought I was all too special.

After the presentation and the subsequent after-work, I was exhausted. I collapsed in my hotel room and slipped into a dreamless sleep. I prayed it’d pass quickly so I could get to my car and just *go home*. I lay there with my eyes closed and waited for the anxious voice to quiet down. You know, the one that keeps telling you how much you’ve done wrong. *That* voice.

“James in accounting got three business cards, Lauren got two. Why didn’t you get any?”

“They were slow on clapping. You messed up the ending.”

“They will remember the fit of that dress more than anything. It was too tight.”

 

The next day I packed, skipped breakfast and threw myself in the shower. I wasn’t wasting another second if I didn’t have to, and I had a 7-hour drive to go. I didn’t dare to use the hotel shampoo, or I might end up with a skin condition, so I always brought my own.

As I rinsed off, I felt this electric pain shooting up my shoulder blade. I couldn’t raise my arm without something snagging the muscle. My pulse shot up, making me think I was having some kind of episode, but it slowed as I mentally checked myself. I could see, taste, and hear just fine. Not even a tingle in my fingertips. There was just this unusual pain.

I reached back and could feel a warmth with my fingers. It was just out of reach, so I stepped in front of the mirror.

 

At just the right angle, I could see an inflamed patch of skin on the back of my left shoulder blade. There was a bulge to it, and I could see little strands of red reach out the sides. I’d had stress reactions before, especially as a kid – but this was something new. Then again, I’d never been as stressed as I’d been the previous day. If I had to pick between a bruise on my shoulder and hundreds of judgmental people, I’ll pick the bruise all day, every day.

I figured I’d get it checked out if it wasn’t gone in a day or two. I must’ve slept weird. And yet, that anxious voice in my mind couldn’t help but add two cents.

“Maybe they saw it. Maybe they were disgusted.”

“Maybe they think you’re sick. Contagious.”

“Maybe that’s why you didn’t get any business cards. Gross.”

 

I slipped out just before 8 am. My phone kept beeping with corporate updates. Someone thanking us for attending. HR reminding us to send in travel and gas receipts. Reminders to check the weekly newsletter. Armand telling me he’d have a better laptop ready for me Monday morning. I turned it all off.

It wasn’t until I was back on the road that I could finally relax. I could listen to what I wanted, at whatever volume I wanted. I could control my space. I was okay. I’d finished this, despite dreading it for months. There’d be no mandatory corporate outings for months, and next time, someone else would have to hold the presentation.

But over the next couple of hours, that spot on my shoulder blade would make itself known. Whenever I took an awkward left turn, or stretched a little too long, that ache would shoot through my arm like I’d touched a candle. And with it, my worries would flare up.

“It wasn’t good enough. They’re gonna get rid of you.”

“You should’ve stayed for breakfast. Now they know there’s something wrong with you.”

But I made it home. I settled into my space, made some time for friends and family, and healed. Monday was just around the corner.

 

The following work week wasn’t that unusual. Two meetings, lunchroom talk, customer satisfaction surveys, and being told to smile despite nothing ever being good enough – thinly veiled beneath corpo-speak of “room for improvement”, “striving for perfection”, and being “oriented for change”. It’s like being home for Christmas.

All through the week, that spot on my shoulder blade got worse. It’d started with a mild swelling, like a bug bite. A warm little spot no bigger than  a fingernail. Now it’d grown to the size of a thumb, and I could feel it throbbing. I started sleeping on my other side. I’d made an appointment with the company doctor, but as it wasn’t an emergency it’d been scheduled a week from now.

By the time I finally got to see a physician, the growth was the size of half a golf ball. It was protruding from the skin, like a hard mass.

 

I was brought in for some tests. Blood work, mostly. A couple of questionnaires about recent events. They checked my throat, did some mobility testing, and poked a couple of nerves. As we wrapped up, I was brought into a small office with an older woman in a white coat. I’d never seen her before, but I figured she was a company affiliate. This was all paid for by our insurance premium.

“It says in your chart you have family history in Saint Gall,” she said. “Can you fill me in on that?”

“Is that relevant?” I asked.

“It could be,” she continued. “There are a couple of environmental factors that we need to exclude. Mostly allergens.”

“My mom’s from Saint Gall,” I said. “I only lived there for a couple of years before we moved to Minneapolis.”

“I see,” she said. “Then I think we have our answer.”

 

She called it polygenic helianthic encapsulation. A stress reaction that can flare up in individuals with a certain combination of genes. It mostly happened to rural folks living near the rockies, but there were a couple of people in rural Minnesota that also carried the gene. It was unusual, and even more unusual for it to flare up like mine had. The reaction was carried by a stress trigger.

“It’s going to come down on its own,” she said. “We’ll get you cortisol cream, and you promise not to poke and prod it. The ache will come and go, but the swelling should subside within a couple of weeks.”

“And if it doesn’t?” I asked.

“Well, then we have to take another look.”

 

I was sent home with what was, in effect, a doctor’s note for people to be extra nice to me at the office. Since the ‘PHE’ was a result of stress, there was talk of prescribing me beta blockers, but I didn’t want to rely too heavily on medication if I didn’t have to. It felt nice to have the option though.

I tried to keep going as normal. I could feel a little chafing here and there when I leaned back too far in my seat, or when absent-mindedly reaching for a cup of coffee. It was always at the most inopportune times, and whenever I felt a sting of pain I’d look up to see worried faces turning my way.

Armand had set me up with a new laptop. Got most of the company software on it so I could work from home for a couple of days if necessary. I could’ve kissed him; it was exactly what I needed. After a nerve-wracking discussion with my superior, I was given the green light to take some time away from the office. Of course, he wasn’t happy with it.

“He’s already looking for a replacement,” whispered the voice in the back of my head.

“You’re being a nuisance.”

“That laptop is full of spyware.”

It was nonsense, but it was nonsense that wouldn’t go away.

 

So I began working from home. I carved out a home office space in my bedroom and made a colored chart to help me organize myself hour-by-hour. Simple, but essential stuff. I could almost stomach the constant meetings and endless torrent of e-mails now, knowing I was safe in a space of my own.

But even so, at the end of the day, that growth kept getting worse. It ached a bit more, and I could feel it all the way into my biceps. There was even the shadow of an ache when I turned my wrist a bit too fast. But as the doctor had said, it would get a little worse before it got better. I just had to be patient.

I decided to take a sick day. I took care of my plants, watched some episodes of a show I’d been putting off, and took a long walk – ending the day with a chicken wrap from a place down on the street corner.

Not a care in the world, for a little while. And yet – the growth got bigger.

 

I tried booking a new appointment, but the doctor said we had to wait for the ‘encapsulation’ to reach the peak. There was little they could do without intervening surgery, and that would most likely cost me some mobility in my arm. It was an option, but we weren’t there yet. We booked another check-up a week down the line, hoping things had leveled out a bit by then.

I noticed how the growth seemed to increase at random. Some days I’d feel like crap, and it wouldn’t move an inch. Other days I could be doing perfectly fine, and it grew by a full inch. I started to use a marker to track the growth, but it was difficult to see in the bathroom mirror.

But there had to be some kind of trigger. It wasn’t just stress, that much was clear. There was something else causing it to grow.

 

I began doing regular checks during the day. Turns out, it didn’t grow steadily all the time; it happened in bursts. And it didn’t just happen when I was stressed either, I could be perfectly fine and still have it grow.

At first I thought it had something to do with my eating habits, or dehydration. But that wasn’t it either; it didn’t correlate to lunch hours or whenever I had a cup of coffee. It didn’t correlate with stress either. The only common denominator was our meetings; it always grew whenever I was in a video call.

But that wasn’t the *only* time it grew. It almost always grew whenever I went outside, and sometimes when I just went into the kitchen for a refill. I made a long list of actions and possible exposure I could’ve experienced in those times of the day, turning a fresh page on my colored hour-chart.

It wasn’t sunshine, humidity, bad or good weather. It wasn’t being inside, or outside. The only thing it seemed to react to was *other people*.

I experimented with this a little more. It wasn’t entirely consistent. I could chat with people just fine, or answer e-mails. I could also take phone calls. But as soon as I got onto a video call, or talked to a real person, it *grew*. So it wasn’t just being near other people – it was about being *seen*.

 

I’ve heard about things reacting to being observed. How it changes things. But this was on a completely different level. I figured the growth had been some kind of build-up because of my disastrous presentation, and that it siphoned off a kind of hormone. Maybe something in my system got clogged from the massive stress. I figured I’d present my theory to the doctor at our next meeting.

The second time I got to talk to that elderly woman in the white coat, I told her all about my theory. I showed her my schedule, my measurements, and explained why I thought this was the answer. She humored me, but didn’t seem all that engaged. After all, there were a few points of data I’d excluded.

“It’s interesting,” she said. “But then why does it still grow during these periods?”

She pointed to one of my charts. The growth still increased in size when I slept, and sometimes when I was just watching TV before going to bed. It would also increase at seemingly random times throughout the day.

“You need to account for that too,” she continued. “And I think there’s a variable we’re not seeing.”

“But can’t we test this?” I asked. “Isn’t there something we can do?”

“We can, but it’ll be gone long before we get a conclusive answer.”

 

The growth was the size of half a cantaloupe by then. It would radiate this intense heat through my entire back. I could feel my pulse through my skin. I had to compensate the weight by leaning to the right, giving me a lopsided walk, which just made things worse. I could swear I felt it growing when people looked at me, and the more it grew, the stranger I looked. It was this weird never-ending cycle.

The doctor had it x-rayed. I managed to sneak a peek of her discussing the growth with a colleague. I saw the image briefly before they took it off the wall, but from what I could see it wasn’t just empty – it looked like a sprawling web of nerves. It wasn’t just a ball of pus; you couldn’t poke a hole in it. It was a collection of little things, all combined into one.

They didn’t discuss their findings with me, and I wasn’t allowed to see the results of the scan. But they still insisted that things were going to work out just fine. I just needed to be calm, confident, and patient. But they ended the meeting by giving me an emergency number. If the growth would burst, or I suddenly fell very ill, I was to call that number.

“Not the emergency services,” the elderly doctor clarified. “You call this number.”

Leaving the hospital with that number in hand, the voice in the back of my head was clearer than ever.

“They’re not telling you everything.”

“They want something for themselves.”

“You can’t trust them.”

 

I was told to take some time off work. Not just a day, but substantial time. It was even recommended by the company doctor, so my boss had no choice but to comply. We started with two weeks, then we would re-evaluate. It didn’t matter what the doctor said about triggers though, or about potential exposure. The growth kept growing no matter what I did. Some of it must have correlated with being seen. It had to.

I decided to put it to a practical test. I watched the growth in the bathroom mirror and drew the edges of it with a marker. That way I could see how much it’d grown after what I was about to do.

 

I went down to the chicken wrap place on the corner during lunch hour. There was a line reaching all the way out the door. I’d covered up my growth with a hoodie, but it was getting harder to hide it. At the very least you could see something was off just with the way I leaned.

I got to the counter, ordered an iced coffee and a wrap, paid, and turned to leave. As I did, I willingly hit my foot on the side of an empty table. I fell forward, spilling lettuce, chicken, and iced coffee all over the floor. It looked a bit more dramatic than I’d anticipated, but it certainly caused a scene. Dozens of people stared me down.

But what I noticed the most wasn’t their stares, it was the voice in the back of my head. It was fuming. Growing louder.

“They will *never* look at you the same way.”

“They’ll sigh *every time* you come back here.”

“They’ll *recognize* you. They’ll *loathe* you.”

I looked up to see concerned faces. One of the baristas rounded the counter to help me up.

“You’re *pathetic*,” the voice continued. “Bothering others just to sate your *curiosity*.”

Despite the harsh thoughts, a hand reached out to me, and I got up. They got me a new wrap, and I was on my way back home – away from prying eyes.

“I wouldn’t eat that,” said the voice. “You have no idea what they’ve done to it.”

And with that, it went in the trash.

 

The growth was bigger, that much was for certain. But it didn’t grow as fast as it did at seemingly random times of the day. About a quarter of an inch in total. It was something, but it wasn’t as explosive as I’d suspected.

“You made a fool of yourself for *nothing*,” the voice reminded me.

But I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to make sense of things, and I wanted to be okay. There had to be some reason why I was feeling the way I did. There had to be a reason why I was weighed down by this thing, growing by the day. What was the end point?

The only thing my stunt accomplished was making my doubts louder. I’ve always been careful about making assumptions, and this was feeding into that uncertainty.

 

I remember sitting on the edge of my bed, getting ready for sleep. It was getting to me.

“It’s still growing,” the voice in my head reminded me.

“I know,” I said out loud.

It was the first time I spoke to it out loud, but it was the most natural thing in the world. I didn’t even question it.

“Are you ready to listen?” it continued.

“I always listen,” I mumbled. “Whether I like it or not.”

“Dangling your feet, talking to yourself. What would they think?”

“I don’t care.”

“Yes - you do.”

And it was right. I cared. I just wanted to blend in. I didn’t want any more stares.

 

I kept having this dream of being put in a cage, naked, far up in the air. I couldn’t cover myself. No matter how I twisted and turned, someone could find an angle. In that dream, there were growths all over me. Some big, some small, all painful. The people down below would point as my cage dangled in the wind. They’d laugh at how I jiggled and squirmed.

I had that dream every night for a full week. I’d wake up feeling exposed to the point where I didn’t dare to shower, in case I’d catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror. I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I told the doctor I didn’t care if my nerves got damaged; I had to get the growth out. But even so, they had to schedule me for a final consultation, and the only available time was two weeks later.

I pulled down all the curtains. I ordered home food. I ate microwaved food in the dark, afraid that the light of my computer screen might cast a reflection I couldn’t stomach. I tried reminding myself it would be okay, eventually, but it was getting harder and harder to convince myself.

 

Until one night.

I sat on the edge of my bed, dangling my legs. The growth was the size of a head. I had to start sleeping on my stomach. It was big enough that it took some time for my heartbeat to reach all the way through it, making this double-pulse through my body. Once when it reached the growth, another when it left. Despite all my efforts, it kept growing.

“I can make sense of it,” the voice suggested. “But you will never listen.”

“I’m tired,” I wheezed.

“I can help you.”

“Whatever.”

I fell face first into my favorite pillow, letting it drink my sweat. I had to pull my covers up a little extra to account for the growth, making a tent-like shape on my back. I closed my eyes.

“You should move your computer out of your bedroom,” it whispered.

“What?”

“I told you it was full of spyware,” the voice said. “You didn’t listen.”

I opened my eyes. It was plausible. I’d moved my computer into my bedroom the moment I started working from home.

“That’s stupid.”

“Then test it,” the voice suggested. “You’re good at testing.”

I made one final effort. I drew the edges of the growth with a marker. I covered up my computer and my phone with blankets and moved them into the kitchen. Then I went to sleep.

 

The next day, the growth was the same size. For the first time, it hadn’t expanded overnight.

“You’re right,” I mumbled in the bathroom mirror. “This is it.”

“I told you,” the voice said. “You never listen to me.”

“Let’s try that then,” I muttered. “Let’s try to listen.”

I could feel my anxiety easing. My feet growing lighter. A soft breeze cooling the sweat on my back. We were in agreement. I was going to listen.

 

I turned off all electronics. I kept the curtains down. I measured, and the growth didn’t expand in the slightest. I could confirm that it did, seemingly, grow whenever I was seen. It *fed* on being seen. But it also exposed that I was being seen even when I didn’t know it.

Armand must have put something in there. He must’ve had a remote connection to the laptop camera. The moment I began working from home, he’d taken advantage of it. But I couldn’t just confront him with it either; he could remove all traces. A growth on my back was hardly *evidence*.

“We’ll expose him ourselves,” the voice said. “You have all the access you need.”

“They can see I’ve been there.”

“Only if they have a reason to look.”

 

So one day after the office closed, I dressed up in a big hoodie and made my way there. I had to drive carefully, since I could hardly use my left arm anymore. Walking was a chore, and running was out of the picture. I’d dug my old phone out of my closet so I could use it to take pictures without risking someone watching me. The voice had said it was fine, and I trusted it well enough.

I took some time avoiding large streets and made my way to the office. I parked at the end of the lot and gave some of the late stragglers a wide berth as to not recognize me from a distance. I scanned my card at the front door and took a left turn down the steps to the basement. A dark corridor lit up, blending the small green and red diodes from the server hall with a neutral fluorescent light.

“I don’t know what to look for,” I mumbled. “I don’t know this stuff.”

“Sure you do,” it said. “You’ve worked with these people for years.”

 

I looked around. There were two small offices; one for Armand, and one for our junior technician. Both were empty, and locked. I placed my hand on Armand’s door and jiggled it a little. There was a rattle.

I’d always thought that the bathroom doors on the third floor, where I usually worked, were too flimsy. These were the same kind of doors. I knew exactly how to bypass that lock. It was just a matter of lifting the door a little and tapping the handle to the left. I did, and it worked.

“Told you,” my inner voice gloated. “You got this.”

 

A pulse shot through my shoulder, forcing me to stop. I had to take a deep breath. The sudden ache caught me breathless like a punch to the gut. I wasn’t okay. Maybe I was delusional. The growth was pulsating – moving. But I had to push through, I couldn’t quit now.

Armand had his work computer set up and ready. He usually left it on, so he didn’t have to start it up in the morning. Besides, there were probably diagnostic tools and backups running. But the screen was locked, and I wasn’t getting through anytime soon. The trail ended there.

“I need a password,” I mumbled. “It’s not gonna be written down. They don’t do that.”

“Maybe it’s your name?” the voice suggested.

I tried and failed. That wasn’t it. It couldn’t be, there was no way he was that obsessed. Even if he was, that’d just be dumb.

“Maybe it’s your last name,” it kept suggesting. “But with zeroes instead of o’s.”

But of course, that wasn’t it either.

 

I checked the room. There were cables running in the corners, all labeled and secured. But a couple of labels were a bit strange. For example, one named “offsite stream buffer”. It was an audio / video feed, but unrelated to the surveillance footage from the building.

I went back out into the hall outside of Armand’s office and felt that ache again. It got worse. My vision blurred, and I could feel a veil clouding my mind. I tried to shake it off, but it was getting to me.

“Push a little further,” the voice said. “You’re on the right track.”

“This was a stupid idea,” I muttered. “You’re throwing me to the goddamn wolves.”

“I’m helping you. You just don’t want to be helped.”

I opened the door to the server room with the same lift and jiggle as before. The lights were off. Powerful fans kept the room cool, leaving the dazzling red and green from the various machines to twinkle like distant stars. My head felt heavy. The growth was swelling. I reached for my old phone and tried to think of the emergency number the doctor had given me, just in case.

 

But with my old phone in hand, I tripped. I fell flat on my stomach, smacking my head into the cold ceramic tiles. The growth was large enough that I could see it lying down. I couldn’t get up. And that double-pulse I’d been feeling was clearer. It wasn’t just a delay; it was a completely different beat. It had a heartbeat – and it was different from mine.

I mumbled to myself, feeling my body grow warm and dull. I wasn’t tired, but I couldn’t stay awake. Consciousness was slipping.

“Not now,” I mumbled. “Not now.”

I blinked, trying to keep my focus. Then the growth moved.

 

I held my breath, listening to the whirr of machines. Then it happened – all without a sound.

Black spikes pierced my hoodie, bursting through my skin. Not an explosion, but a *hatching*.

There was no blood. Something sticky running down the sleeve of my arm. Something moving, getting tangled in the fabric. And the moment my nerves realized what was happening, my mind escaped to that space beyond sleep.

Lights out.

 

When I woke up, I was propped up against one of the server cabins. Armand was there, looking down at me. He’d been running. Maybe he spotted me on the surveillance cameras. Maybe he had an extra in his office.

“What the *fuck* happened to you?” he asked.

There was no voice in my head to tell me what to say anymore. No guidance, no counsel. Not even a scolding. It was quiet. I could feel my exposed shoulder. The fluids on my back had cooled, giving me a feverish shiver.

“I figured you out,” I smiled. “I know what you’re doing.”

“You’re insane,” he said, shaking his head. “I’ll call someone.”

He picked up his phone and started to dial a number. There was a glimpse of doubt in me. Maybe this had all just been lie, after lie, after lie. A way for whatever had been clinging to me to justify its existence.

Or maybe it wasn’t. I looked up at Armand and cleared my throat.

“Offsite stream buffer.”

 

He paused. He turned to me and shook his head, fumbling for the right words. When he couldn’t find them, he shrugged.

“I should’ve picked someone less fucking paranoid.”

I tried to get up, but my muscles backfired. My nerves were trying to make sense of what’d happened, and I’d lost most, if not all sensation, in my left arm and legs. Even my neck kept swiveling like I’d been on a bender.

“I suppose you have to go away,” Armand said. “Sorry about that.”

He fetched a couple of cables from one of the supply closets and bent down. He tied up my legs. I could see it, but I couldn’t feel a thing. I tried to move, but all I did was topple over.

“You’re not very good at this,” he continued. “Not much of a fighter.”

“You don’t know shit about me.”

“Oh, I know more than you think,” he smiled. “And so does about five thousand anonymous donors. You’re kinda fun, you know.”

The words echoed in my mind, reverbing into a cold sweat. Five thousand? Was that a real number? All these people watching me. What had they seen? They probably had my name and address. I couldn’t think straight, and for once, there was no voice in the back of my mind to make things worse. I didn’t spiral. Not this time. But it was too late.

It made sense. This was what made it grow at random times – someone tuning in to *watch*.

 

Armand tied up my legs and wrists. He tried to move me, but when he put his hand on my shoulder he had to step back. Something stuck to the palm of his hand.

“What the fuck are you? Half snail?”

He fumbled through his pocket, looking for a wet wipe and some hand sanitizer. He had some trouble using it single-handedly and made this awkward little dance trying to figure out how to hold it all with his elbow. But it was finally sinking in. This goofy, harmless-looking nobody, was going to make me disappear. He’d probably strangle me to death with a CAT 4 cable and drop me off the side of the highway – or bury me in a shallow grave.

The fighting was over before it begun. I’d lost the moment I walked down those stairs.

 

I’d always figured death would come from somewhere stupid. Somewhere I could’ve avoided. I’d been afraid of everything from wasps to almost-expired cheese, and what would get me killed turned out to be the one time I acted with confidence. That’s all it took – one step in the wrong direction.

I couldn’t accept this. My heart raced, but no matter how I twisted and turned, all the strength in me had died. I was exposed, and vulnerable. At any other time and day I would’ve stood a chance, but now I was a sitting duck.

Armand wiped his hands and threw away the wet wipe. I thought his face would look different the moment he decided he was going to murder me, but it looked the same as always when he turned to me.

Maybe he always knew he wanted to do this.

 

Something plopped down on the floor. Something dark. Not much larger than a finger.

Armand stepped on it and almost slipped.

“Disgusting,” he said. “What did you-“

Another plopped down. And another.

Looking up, the ceiling was covered in them. Little dark things, sticking to the ceiling.

 

“*I told you*,” a voice echoed. “*He wants to hurt you*.”

“*Wants to kill you*,” another chimed in.

“*Wants to make you a plaything. His plaything. Everyone’s plaything*.”

“*He thinks he’s clever*,” something added with a laugh. “*His mother said he was clever*.”

“*He sleeps alone, and it hurts him. It hurts him so much*.”

 

Armand turned left and right, looking around. His eyes were going wild.

I realized that he was hearing it too. That voice inside my head had burst out, and it was crawling across the ceiling. My anxiety. My pain. Every intrusive thought I’d had, given flesh and intent. And as they fell from the ceiling, he could only brush off so many before they were on him.

I could see them moving and squirming to get under his clothes. Some of them had spikes in the front, others had spikes along the ridge of a circling spine. They weren’t exactly snakes, or worms, they were more like long sea urchins. They had this musculature where they could move their skin one way, and their bones another.

There must have been a hundred of them, crawling all over. Piercing his skin and pinching his nerves. He made it all the way out the door, then collapsed in the hallway outside. Armand didn’t scream, it was more of a painful mewling. A sad groan, growing longer and quieter.

He crawled pretty far, but it didn’t stop them. I could her every spike puncturing the skin, like stabbing an orange with a sharp pencil.

And after a while, it was quiet - but for the hum of the servers.

 

A dark mass gathered in front of me. Little dark things crawling on top of one another, arranging themselves into a colony - like the one that had lived in me. The doctors must have known.

“I can’t hear you anymore,” I said. “It’s quiet.”

Dozens of voices, all using slight variations and different words. All amounting to the same thing; *I was a good listener.*

“Is it over?” I asked. “Are you going away?”

And this time, the answer was unequivocal.

“Yes.”

I closed my eyes, hoping my body would find the strength to recover. I could feel the careful wriggle of a hundred little things, curling up against the edge of me, like a cat settling into its owner’s lap.

A part of me knew they’d be gone by morning. And they were.

 

It was the junior technician that found us. I have no idea what he must’ve thought, but he called security. From there, it escalated. The authorities deemed it self-defense. A puncture wound from a pen, straight to Armand’s neck. Of course they knew it was hundreds, if not thousands of wounds. But somehow, the report looked different from reality. It didn’t even mention how I couldn’t have done it, as I was tied up the moment he died. There were also cameras, who had conveniently stopped working.

I was asked surprisingly few questions, and most of them were leading. The officer in charge more or less spelled it out for me.

“And that’s when he attacked you, *right*?”

“And then you picked up this pen, *right*?”

“And you had no choice but to fight back, *right*?”

They made the story for me. I didn’t have to say much. Just nod and sign the paper.

 

The final check-up with the doctor was quick. The skin on my back was intact, there was only the outline of a sac from where the growth had been. They cut the excess skin off, and I didn’t feel a thing. I was perfectly normal from that point on. At least physically. I wanted to tell them about the mass, and the many dark things, but it was implied that they already knew. Perhaps it would have been worse to stop it. Maybe our medical professionals know something we don’t.

Before we went our separate ways, I decided to ask.

“What did you do with them?”

And the old doctor looked at me.

“We put them back in the ocean,” she said. “That’s where they come from.”

 

I suppose bad things happen to people all the time, but we all react differently. I think I will always be the kind of person to assume the worst and take measures to avoid it, no matter if a voice tells me to or not. It’s just the way I was built.

1lav5dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vancouver4Friends/comments/1lav5dp/26m_looking_for_friends/,26M LOOKING FOR FRIENDS...,"Hey folks,

Lately, I’ve been putting myself out there, meeting up with new people, grabbing coffee, having some good conversations and it’s been nice in the moment. I like to think I’m pretty open and easy to talk to. I enjoy meaningful chats, laughing over little things, and just sharing some real connection.

But I’ll be honest, even after a few meetups, things just kind of fizzle. I walk away thinking, *“That went well!”* but then it doesn’t really go anywhere. It’s hard to tell if that’s just how things go these days, or if I’m missing something.

I’m not looking for a huge friend group or constant texting, just some real, consistent friendships with people who want the same. The kind where you can hang out without pressure, have real talks, share dumb memes, or even sit in comfortable silence over coffee.

if you’re also out here wondering where all the chill, genuine people are, feel free to reach out. Maybe we’ll click, maybe not! IG there's only one way to find out.

Do you love drama? Perhaps angst? Or old friends finally trusting to find they still love each other after all those years? Do you love when Christmas movies are so sweet and show happy endings? Well then I may have the perfect role for you! So read on and see! 

All characters and participants must be 18 or older!! I’m 21 so if you could also be 21 that would be great!

A little about me: 

Hello I am Em.  I'm in my twenties, so please, please be eighteen or older. I write in third person; on average, I will write five hundred to two thousand words per post. I prefer writing on Discord; I also do a ratio of eighty percent story to twenty percent smut.  This is not all about smut so if your first message includes anything sexual you will be blocked.  This is not negotiable, no second chances.  I don't care about your real-life gender as long as you match my length or attempt to do so. I also only write in third person.  






**Plot Idea:** 

Muse A and B were childhood friends. They were inseparable. Their families always thought they would get married. That was Muse A's older brother died. She fell off the deep end. At first it wasn't noticeable as she followed in his footsteps, becoming an army medic. It was only noticeable just how bad things had gotten when she came home. Years battling her drug abuse and bouncing from shelter to shelter. Muse A is pretty sure her life will never get better. Meanwhile, Muse B? He is a rich man who owns a company doing something. They live completely opposite lives. The two lost touch years ago. That is until this Christmas. When Muse B finally agrees to fly home to New York for Christmas. He is not looking forward to being here at all. That is until he runs into the homeless woman holding up the line at the local coffee shop. Can he save her? Maybe, just maybe, she is the reason he is supposed to come home? Their folks always said the two were like magnets, always going to find their way back to each other. 




**Writing Sample** 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.


The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left. Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. 


The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrian slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.


That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. 



Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world. ""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. 



Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. 




The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.


PREGNANT.


In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.



All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow. With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa,"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.



Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

1lauyeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1lauyeu/only_then_life_will_be_life/,Only then life will be life,"I (31M) have been reading this sub for some months, participating whenever I feel I can give good advice. I actually feel weird texting here, as my story is far away from being as complicated or life-threatening as the ones I read, but I have been thinking about posting for quite a long time.

My life is supposed to be great: I have a wonderful girlfriend that loves me and supports me, friends that like me and want to have fun with me, a highly paid job that allows me to have a comfortable life and everything setup for having a nice life.

The reality is that I feel out of place, and that I have felt like it for a while.

I travel a lot for job purposes (122 working days  abroad in 2024, I know the exact number because I need to declare it to the tax office) and I feel like my life is consuming without the always-promised good things coming. I do not have time for myself, I cannot hold a routine and I was always told ""in the next stage you will do/have whatever and you will be happy"". Professionally/studies talking, this moment never came.

I was OK with it, but in a travel break my best friend and I started dating. That changed everything.

She is great, the best human being I could think about. She is not only making the best of my days, she is my life companion and still my best friend, she is making me discover parts of me that I never knew I had.

Just a silly example: We were invited to a wedding last month and we danced together all night. I had never danced in my life as I am quite a shy guy, and I discovered by her side how cool is to dance, to enjoy a party, to move your body as you feel, to share the moment with someone... It felt organic and releasing and I had the time of my life. Her moved, her smile, the way she was looking at me. World could have ended and I could not care less.

Last Friday we went dinner after one of my work-related trips and I was falling asleep on the restaurant table. I am just exhausted.

She told me not to worry, that everything was OK, that she understands it... She woke up earlier on Saturday, made breakfast for both of us and we spent the day walking around a botanical garden. It was wonderful and we had a really good time, I relaxed and I forgot everything around. She is just great.

Despite she said everything is OK, it is not OK for me.

I realised my life is life when I am by her side, that I am happy when I have my routine, that I want to go in a date with her and be all night making love, waking up lazy in the morning, repeat, take a shower together, make breakfast, go out...

I have been all my life in war mode, fighting for each of the steps I reached, going from anxiety to break and back to anxiety again.

I read some days ago a book (7 habits of highly effective people) in which one of the chapters is ""First things first"", which talks about prioritizing as one of the keys and I want to prioritise my life. Another chapter is ""Start with a goal in mind"", and a happy life is my goal.

Now I am going on full-war mode, I am going to change everything that is not fine one step as a time, I am convinced about where I am going and what I want to get. My life is mine, and I want to reach a point in which I do not have to keep juggling with all the things that are not right, otherwise life is going to be too long.

Only once I win this final one, which might get nasty along the way, everything might be alright. Please wish me luck.

For all of those struggling with anything, please take these three pieces advices:

1. Start with a goal in mind: Before trying to just change things and start moving up and down like a headless chicken, define where you want to go and how/who you want to be.

2. First things first: Prioritize what is really important. Great part of the things that block us or ocupy our minds are not going to impact our lifes long-term.

3. One thing at a time: It feels sometimes like we can manage everything at once and fast, but then reality hits and motivation and change desire go away. Try to change everything around little by little. As we say in Spain, Granada was not conquered in two days.

We are surrounded by good people, despite sometimes we do not realise. Today I was drunk, trashed and closing a bar where I have the morning coffee everyday and they talked to me, made me sandwich and talk to me. Also, this sub can be the support some people do not have. Leverage on them for getting control of your life and reach happiness.

Only then life will be life, and I will get my routine, make love all night, wake up lazy in the morning, repeat, take a shower with her, make her breakfast, go out...

The [Meta Ray-Ban Glasses (Renewed)](https://amzn.to/3HUk9pH) promise hands-free capture, music on the go, and instant social sharing, blending classic looks with Meta’s tech smarts. As someone who tests everything from GoPros to the latest AR toys, I wore these everywhere for a week—coffee runs, dog walks, live events, and even Zoom calls. Here’s the truth about this **smart glasses with camera** trend.

# Design & Comfort

They look and feel like real Ray-Bans—no chunky temple arms or sci-fi vibes. The weight is slightly more than standard Ray-Bans, but at about 50g, you quickly forget you’re wearing “tech.” The acetate frames are sturdy, and renewed units showed minimal wear (an occasional tiny scratch at the hinge, nothing major). Comfortable for hours, and you can choose classic Wayfarer or round lens styles.

# Tech Features & Everyday Experience

**Camera:**  
The tiny, nearly invisible camera lets you take photos or 60-second videos with a tap—or with voice control (“Hey Meta, take a photo”). Photos are 12MP, video is full HD (1080p). Quality is great in daylight—think better than most laptops, a notch below top phones. Night shots are just so-so.

**Audio:**  
Open-ear speakers built into the arms let you stream music, podcasts, or make calls without blocking your ears. Audio is clear up to 60% volume, but don’t expect deep bass or total privacy (people next to you will hear a faint buzz if you crank it). For podcasts and calls, they’re better than expected.

**Voice Assistant:**  
You get hands-free Meta AI (formerly Facebook assistant), handling calls, messages, music, and even quick Google searches or translation prompts. Response time is solid as long as you’re connected to your phone.

**Sharing:**  
Photos and videos sync instantly to the Meta View app on iOS/Android for easy sharing to WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, or downloads.

# Battery Life

Meta claims up to 4 hours “active use”—in testing, that meant 2.5–3 hours of on-off camera, streaming, and calls. The case gives 2–3 full recharges for all-day use. Not “all-day always-on,” but enough for typical outings. The **Meta Ray-Ban battery life** is fine if you treat these like short-trip action tech, not 8-hour wearables.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Real Ray-Ban style—nobody knows you’re wearing smart glasses
* Instant voice/photo/video capture for moments you’d miss fumbling with your phone
* Comfortable for hours, fits standard Ray-Ban cases
* Decent speakers for podcasts/music on the go
* Smooth Meta app syncing for sharing
* Renewed units are a bargain vs new

**Cons:**

* Battery life is “session” not all-day
* Audio leaks at high volume, not for private listening
* Camera is solid in daylight, weak at night/indoors
* Voice assistant only works when connected to phone
* Renewed means minor (but visible) cosmetic wear

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $263 renewed (when new is usually $329+), the Meta Ray-Ban Glasses undercut most smart eyewear options and stylishly beat out chunky AR headsets and action cams for casual capture.

Ever find yourself staring at your screen, mind buzzing with everything *but* the task at hand? Or maybe you're trying to read, and your eyes just keep glazing over the same paragraph? We've all been there. In a world that constantly bombards us with distractions - social media pings, urgent emails, the never-ending to-do list - finding that sweet spot of intense focus can feel like a superpower.

But here's the thing: while focus can feel elusive, it's not entirely out of reach. What if I told you there are natural compounds, often called nootropics, that might just give your brain the gentle nudge it needs to cut through the noise and achieve laser-sharp concentration? I've been exploring this space for a while, and in my experience, when used thoughtfully, certain nootropics can really make a difference.

Now, let's be clear - we're not talking about magic pills here. Nootropics aren't a substitute for good sleep, a healthy diet, or regular exercise. Think of them more like an amplifier for your existing potential. They can help optimize your brain's natural pathways, making it easier to lock in and get things done.

Ready to dive in? Let's explore my top 7 nootropics that often get a thumbs-up for boosting focus and concentration.

## The Dream Team for Dialing In Your Focus

When I'm looking to really zero in on a project, these are the heavy hitters I consider. They work in different ways, but the goal is always the same: clearer thinking and sustained attention.

### 1. L-Theanine - The Zen Master of Focus

You know that smooth, calm focus you get from green tea? That's largely thanks to **L-Theanine**. This amino acid is fascinating because it can promote a state of relaxed alertness. It helps increase alpha brain waves, which are associated with a calm, focused state, without making you feel drowsy.

* **How it helps focus:** It's fantastic for reducing jitters or anxiety that can often come with stimulants (like caffeine, more on that next!). By calming the mind, it allows for a clearer, more sustained focus. I often pair it with my morning coffee.

### 2. Caffeine - The Classic Kick (with a Twist)

Ah, **Caffeine**. Most of us know it well! It's the world's most widely consumed psychoactive substance, and for good reason. It works by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes relaxation and sleepiness.

* **How it helps focus:** It's a great short-term boost for alertness and mental energy. But here's the twist I mentioned: when you combine caffeine with L-Theanine, it's like magic. You get all the alertness of caffeine without the jitters, anxiety, or crash. It's a combo I swear by for productive mornings.

### 3. Lion's Mane Mushroom - The Brain Builder

This isn't your average culinary mushroom! **Lion's Mane Mushroom** is a fascinating fungus that's been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It's known for its potential to support nerve growth factor (NGF) in the brain, which is crucial for brain health and plasticity.

* **How it helps focus:** While it might not give you an immediate jolt like caffeine, many users, including myself, report improved mental clarity, memory, and a general sense of ""brain brightness"" over time. This foundational support can significantly enhance your ability to concentrate.

### 4. Bacopa Monnieri - The Memory Enhancer

**Bacopa Monnieri** is an herb that's a staple in Ayurvedic medicine. It's really celebrated for its cognitive-enhancing properties, particularly around memory and learning. It works by influencing neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine, which are key for cognitive function.

* **How it helps focus:** While it's slower-acting and needs consistent use (think weeks, not hours), Bacopa can help reduce mental fog and improve information processing. By supporting a calmer, clearer mind, it indirectly but powerfully boosts your ability to focus on complex tasks.

### 5. Rhodiola Rosea - The Stress Buster

If stress and fatigue are constantly hijacking your attention, then **Rhodiola Rosea** might be your new best friend. This adaptogenic herb helps your body adapt to stress - both physical and mental.

* **How it helps focus:** When you're stressed, your focus goes out the window, right? Rhodiola helps combat fatigue, improve mood, and enhance mental performance under pressure. By reducing stress and burnout, it frees up your mental resources so you can actually concentrate. It's pretty cool how it works.

### 6. Alpha-GPC - The Choline Champion

**Alpha-GPC** is a highly bioavailable form of choline, an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in brain health. Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for memory, learning, and - you guessed it - focus.

* **How it helps focus:** By providing the brain with the building blocks it needs, Alpha-GPC can help improve attention span, mental alertness, and cognitive processing speed. It's like giving your brain the premium fuel it needs to run smoothly.

### 7. Creatine - More Than Just Muscles!

Wait, **Creatine**? Isn't that for bodybuilders? You're right, it's famous for muscle growth and performance. But what's fascinating is its role in brain energy! Creatine helps regenerate ATP, the primary energy currency of your cells, including brain cells.

* **How it helps focus:** Your brain is a super energy-hungry organ. When brain cells have more readily available energy, they can perform better. Studies suggest creatine can improve working memory and intelligence, especially in situations where your brain is under stress or sleep-deprived. It's a subtle but powerful helper for sustained mental output.

## Wrapping It Up: Find Your Focus Flow

So, there you have it - my top 7 nootropics for sharpening your focus and concentration. Each one offers a unique pathway to a clearer, more engaged mind. Remember, the world of nootropics is personal. What works wonders for one person might be subtle for another.

My biggest piece of advice? Start slow, pay attention to how your body responds, and always prioritize the fundamentals: sleep, nutrition, and exercise. Nootropics are powerful tools, but they work best when you're already giving your brain a solid foundation.

# Chapter 4: The Genius and The Battleship

Ulrich

“Y-You’re like me…”

*What is she talking about? Who is this woman?*

A myriad of questions swirl in my mind as the woman continues to stare at me with wide eyes. As I stare back at her with a confused expression, I take in more of her appearance as if it could reveal what she is talking about. Her short, platinum blonde, blunt bob hair trails down her perfect face and blue eyes, the color reminding me of the cool, blue sky. But the most prominent feature of hers right now is the swell of her belly, round and plump with new life. The pregnant woman looked over to the man she called Jake and touched his arm to calm him down.

“Honey, it’s ok. You can put the gun down…” she says softly.

Jake lowered the pistol that he’d been using as a club.

“You know her, hun?” He asks, tilting his head curiously.

She shakes her head, “No, but she’s still one of us. So, we’re gonna be good guests, right?” she says softly. The man seems to melt at her words, the pistol completely forgotten as he stares into the woman’s eyes. He then receives an alarm on his phone, pulling it out to check it.

“Dang it, kids will be up soon for school…” he mutters, “Gotta get everything ready for the little gremlins.” He then kisses her cheek before jogging towards the house. The woman smiles and turns towards me and Nico. “Y’all hungry?”

The woman leads us towards the house and lets us in. Immediately, we are bombarded by the sounds of young kids running and playing around, the sound of laughter and mischief in the air. The woman gets an annoyed look and mutters.

“God damn it… JAKE CALLOWAY!” She bellows, startling both me and Nico as we look at each other. The sound of giggling stops as a voice rings out from the second floor.

“Yes, hun?” says the man, who is clearly in trouble now

“Weren’t you supposed to get the kids downstairs and eat breakfast?” she shouts upstairs again, “Cause I swear to God, if you’re gonna make me come upstairs while pregnant, you ain’t sleeping in the bed for a month!” she threatens. We can only imagine how pale his face must have gone, because not long after we hear the sound of him shouting playfully at the kids, “OK, WE BETTER GO! MAMA AIN’T HAPPY WITH DADDY NOW!” We hear the sounds of more laughter as we see Jake rushing down the stairs with two squirming bundles over his shoulders. Once downstairs, he sets the two kids down on a pair of chairs near the table. The kids are a splitting image of both parents' best features. The oldest of the two, a little girl no more than six or seven years old, has the same short, platinum-blond hair and blue eyes as the mom. The youngest kid, a little boy of three to four years old, looks almost identical to his old man, from the scraggly dark brown hair to his button nose. Both kids dig into their cereal with gusto, spilling a little bit of milk around them with every spoonful. Jake chuckles at the scene as he takes a sip of coffee he brewed while the woman sighs.

“Kids, slow down… you’re gonna get sick if you eat so fast,” she says exasperated. Jake just smiles and says, “Ah, let them have some fun hun…” but he’s quickly shut down by his wife’s glare, the blue eyes almost turning icy. He quickly clears his throat, “What I meant to say was… kids, listen to your mother.” he says, making both me and Nico smile at the playful banter between them. The kids seem to notice us at the sound of our voices and look at us curiously. The little girl locks eyes with me and points at my face before going, “You got pretty eyes!” she exclaims, making me look away from her. The woman once again smiles softly. “She sure does. Now, you kids better get ready for school. Jake, take the kids to school and… this man here with you for the errand.” She says, pointing at Nico. “Me and the young lady here have something to talk about, alone.” I feel my blood run cold at the idea of finally getting some answers about myself, but I stammer.

“W-Wait, why does he have to leave?” I ask, looking over to Nico.

“Well, if you wish for him to stay for our chat, he can…” she says, giving me another gentle smile. I look back at Nico and then back at the woman, conflicted. But as I remain silent, Nico speaks up.

“I can go… don’t worry about me, Ulrich. I’ll be right back, ok?” he says reassuringly.

*Wait, please don’t…* 

“Ok, but be back soon,” I say calmly, betraying the inner turmoil inside me. I watch both Jake and Nico leave with the kids in tow, driving off to wherever they’re going. Looking back at the woman, she sits herself down on a couch and lays herself up against the cushions, absentmindedly stroking her belly as she sighs.

“You don’t know who I am, do you?” she asks, looking over to me next to the door. “You can come closer, I won't bite.”

Cautiously, I step closer to her before shaking my head. “No, I don’t.”

The woman nods in understanding before closing her eyes. Out of the woman's back, cannons appear and she disappears after a few moments. “I am George Washington, as in the Battleship George Washington. I am what is known as a Kansen, a living embodiment of a naval vessel,” she explains looking over to me.

“You’re telling me I am…?” I don’t finish my sentence before she nods.

“Yes, my dear. I can tell that you’re one of us, but I never got your name…” she asks, looking over at me with a smile.

“Ulrich, my name is Ulrich Von Hutten,” I say with a confused look. “So wait, I’m not a real person?” 

George shakes her head, “No, my dear… you’re as real as that boy who was with you. Flesh and blood and all the other junk, but you’re also more. You see, as a Kansen, you never have to worry about aging. It’s one of the benefits of being one of us, along with increased strength and being nearly bulletproof.” she explains.

“Bulletproof?!” I exclaim

“Yes, bulletproof to most calibers. Now, if you were hit by a rocket launcher, you would certainly not survive that, but something small like a pistol or rifle, you should be ok.”

*Nico jumped in front of the pistol to protect me when it would have done nothing… he did it by instinct…*

“So… why do I not have cannons like yours?” I ask, revealing my spider limbs. George looks at me curiously before shrugging.

“That is a good mystery. You don’t seem to be very aware of most things a Kansen is taught early on…” she says, deep in thought. I immediately get defensive.

“Well, it’s not like they gave me a manual before I ran,” I say, looking away.

George looks again with a hint of worry now. “You were made recently, weren’t you?”

I look away and say nothing.

*She’s only trying to help*.

“Honey, if you don’t want to talk about it, it’s ok…” she says softly, patting the side of the couch to let me sit. I sit down and take a deep sigh.

“I just… I woke up in a shipyard in Hamburg and… nothing else. I only had a name, Ulrich Von Hutten, but I could hear the scientist who found me only ever calling me ‘the accident’ or ‘the unwanted’” I say with a deep anger resonating in my voice. “I was never meant to exist… I was an accident that just appeared. All of this is happening because I just appeared out of nowhere.” The words come tumbling out as I continue, “I… I am a failure who deserves this life… this miserable, awful life…” 

Silence falls into the house as the weight of my words lingers in the air. I compose myself again before looking over to George, who’s covering her mouth while a single tear rolls down her cheek. I look away embarrassed. 

“Sorry…” I say, feeling her gently try and hug me. As soon as I sense the incoming hug, my spider limbs wrap around me again as if to shield me from the caring arms.

“Don’t be… you did nothing wrong…” She whispers before pulling away from my spider arms. I look back at her with my usual composed look.

Another moment of silence falls into the house before I speak up.

“So, that man was your husband?” I ask, making her smile.

“That big doofus? Yeah, that’s my husband alright…”

“He came at us with a flintlock pistol… I mean, who does that?” I say as if trying to wrap my head around that fact. George just chuckles.

“He would have never harmed you too. He may be a little… eccentric…” she says with a smile, “... but he has always been harmless to people. The only people he doesn’t like are cops.”

“Cops?” I ask

“Yeah, he always tinkers and creates things, so he hates it when someone takes away his inventions… so he may be interrogating your boyfriend if he’s a cop or not…” she says casually. At the words ‘boyfriend’ I can feel my cheeks turning pink.

“HE’S NOT MY BOYFRIEND,” I say very quickly and loudly, surprising her. She says nothing but grins widely, seeing through the obvious embarrassment.

“Sure\~,” she says with a grin.

My cheeks turn from rosy to a bright red. “I-IT’S TRUE!” I say, my heart beating faster. “He’s just… I owe him for saving me once, so I’m sticking by him…” I say, looking away. “But I do NOT love him…” I say one final time before looking back at George’s grinning face.

“You’re right… he’s not even that cute anyway. He’s got, what? A cute button nose, soft, brown lock…” she says softly. I absentmindedly continue the list of his features, lost in my thoughts of him.

“His adorable little dimples, his emerald eyes…” I say, my face now fully red as I catch myself, looking back at George who is now grinning more widely.

“Darling…” she begins

*Please don’t*

“...I think …” she continues 

*I’m gonna die, don’t say it…*

“... you’re in L.O.V.E\~” 

I immediately stood up and hid my face in my hands, rushing to the bathroom.

*I DON’T, I DON’T, I DON’T LOVE HIM!* I scream in my mind. Quickly, I close the bathroom door and splash my face with water, trying to calm myself down.

*Get a hold of yourself, Ulrich… emotions are poison…* I think, but my mind can’t help itself.

*Nico… what have you done to me…?*

I splash myself with water, trying to get my mind off his nose, chest, hair, and his eyes.

*God, his eyes who can see the real me, deep down even after hiding away for so long…*

I look up into the mirror, my reflection staring back with its yellow, slit eyes. At that moment, I let the mask of indifference slip off, my voice small and quiet as I confessed to myself how I truly felt.

“I… I love him…”

The self-confession is cut short as I hear George shouting, “WHAT THE HELL?! YOU GUYS WERE GONE FOR A HOUR, HOW ARE YOU DRUNK?!”

Nico

I watch as Jake drops off the kids at the preschool before coming back to the car.

“Aight, time to grab the items on the list for the wife… and then we head back…” he says, turning on the car. I watch him for a moment before I speak up. “You know, your accent is… foreign, isn’t it?” I ask, curiously.

“Yeah, I’m from the States originally. Met my wife there, we got married and then we moved here.” He says with a smile, eyes still on the road. “Y’know, what they gals might be talking about?” he says, looking towards me.

I shake my head, “No idea… but do you know what your wife meant when she said ‘like me?’” I ask.

He takes a sigh, “Maybe it’s about her being a Kansen…”

My eyes go wide, “Wait, you’re married to a Kansen?! I thought they all died years ago! They were all mostly born during WWII, weren’t they?” I say, incredulously. He nods.

“Yeah, they were, but they don’t age, kiddo. I have no clue how Kansen works, but in the fifteen years we’ve been married, I haven’t seen her age a day.” He says, putting the car in park and getting out. “Now, c’mon. We gotta get groceries.”

I quickly get out of the car and follow him as he continues talking, “Yeah, I’m blessed. I got myself hitched to the great USS George Washington\~” He says with a grin. “Ain’t nothing better than that. But I must say, you got yourself a pretty girl too.”

The words make me blush instantly

“I-I don’t… I mean…” I stammer nervously, making him laugh.

“Kid, you ain’t fooling anyone. You are red as a tomato and you’re stumbling like a blind fool” 

My blush becomes more prominent, but the memory of my ex resurfaces.

*What if she gets tired of me like Isabella did…?*

I shake the thought away, but the feeling lingers deep down. Noticing my face, Jake blurts out, “Man, you down something bad. What’s up you?” The bluntness of his questions leaves me flat-footed, but the look in his eyes tells me that he would listen without any judgment. I let out a sigh.

“You ever felt like you’d been trapped all your life and then you’d been sprung free from your cage, but don’t know what to do? Like, you’ve lived so long in your cage that the idea of flying away is… terrifying…” I take a breath, the weight of my confession lingering heavy on my shoulders, “I lived in Bobbio Pellice all my life, and I half expected to live out the rest of my days there. Wake up, work a dead-end job, and come back home… day in and day out…”

Jake looks at me with a scrutinizing eye, absentmindedly picking up items from the grocery shelf and placing them into the bags. “But…?”

I sigh, “But… she arrived.” I say, a small wistful smile gracing my lips, “My ex broke off things that very night, and I was angry… I don’t know what I would have done to myself if Ulrich hadn’t shown up. She’s closed off, and most times I’m not sure how she’s feeling. One moment she pulls me closer to be held, but she then wraps those spider arms around herself as if I was corrosive.” I sigh, helping him check out of the grocery store. “I need a drink… Come, I got enough for a beer or two. We can share…”

*Maybe the alcohol will dull this ache in my chest*.

Jake looks at me with a hint of worry. “I ain’t sure if that’s smart…” he starts to say but I gently nudge his shoulder.

“C’mon, drinks never hurt anyone… especially if someone else is paying!” I say, getting back in the car. “To the bar we go!” I say, a small smile creeping on my lips.

*He’s not a bad guy. Maybe just a little eccentric*

He relents after a few moments, beginning to drive to a nearby bar. I pay for two beers and we both quickly drink them down. Those two beers quickly turn into four, then six… and so on… We’re both giggling and laughing at stories from our childhood by the end.

“... and that’s how I got KICKED out of the States!” Jake says with a bellowing laugh. “You should have seen the CIA’s faces! The place was blown to shit!” taking another swing of his drink, he lets out a burp which is interrupted by a group of teens only slightly younger than me, around eighteen to nineteen.

“Watch it, bastardo,” says the young man with a sneer. “You made me spill my drink.”

I can’t help but laugh a little, “Man, your grip must be shit then. I can only imagine how you hold your…” I find myself unable to finish my sentence as it devolves into a fit of laughter, accompanied by Jake’s laugh. The comment seems to irritate the young man, his expression turning from a sneer to a scowl. 

“Yeah, still gets more bitches than both your sorry asses combined.” He says, clearly satisfied with his comeback. 

Both me and Jake look at each other with a grin, as if we had just been permitted to verbally destroy him. 

“Oh? I didn’t know prostitutes began to charge by the centimeter. In that case here…” I say, holding a single euro. “KEEP THE CHANGE,” I say before bursting into a fit of laughter with Jake. I could see the man’s face twist into a scowl as he got close to me, grabbing my collar. 

“You little shit…” the man growled before Jake put his hand on the man’s shoulder.

“Woah, hey, no need for that. It was just a joke.” He says, still chuckling a little. The man looked at him and said in anger.

“I’ll get to you too, American. Probably got a fatass wife with all those burgers you all must…” The man did not finish his sentence as a right hook connected against his lower jaw. My eyes go wide as Jake cracks the knuckles of his fist. His eyes are cold and piercing, a far cry from his earlier jovial attitude.

“You don’t talk about my wife like that. EVER.” He says with a snarl. The man quickly stands up tackles Jake and throws him onto a table, beverages spilling everywhere as the table collapses under the weight. The man’s friends notice the commotion and make their way towards his friends. Noticing their aggression, I call out.

“Hey, coglione!” I shout before slugging him with a left hook. He took the brunt of the punch with his arm, dodging backward before retaliating. I move out of the way just in time as the adrenaline begins to rise. Jake and the first man continue their tussle, slamming into the jukebox and starting it up. The jukebox starts blaring *Un Battito Ancora* by GLI ULTIMI, and all hell breaks loose in the bar as Jake and I continue the fight. He takes punch after punch while trying to get the upper hand on his foe, while I try to dodge every punch thrown my way. 

“GOD DAMN IT!” Jake shouts as he grabs a hold of the guy’s arm and twists it, the man screaming in pain. Jake stumbles a little, the alcohol still affecting him as the guy uses it to his advantage and frees himself. Meanwhile, I dodge my foe’s punch and slam a shot glass into his face before taking a different shot glass and downing the content down my throat. With my foe knocked unconscious and with a face full of broken glass, I go and help Jake. I grab a hold of the guy from behind and give a quick punch to his nose, knocking him unconscious too. The bar goes quiet except for the music as we look around at the mess we made. Our faces are flushed from the alcohol and our breathing is heavy as we come down from our adrenaline high. I see the bartender on the phone and say to Jake. 

“Shit, the cops…” I say, slightly slurring the word cop.

“Let’s go…” He replies, the both of us stumbling out of the bar and into his car, driving away quickly. As we drive, we look at each other before bursting into laughter.

“OH MY GOD, I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED!” I say loudly.

“What a fucking prick…” Jake says, looking at me “You alright, kiddo? You were dodging those punches like they were nothing! Where did you learn to do that?” He asks, picking up speed.

“Oh you know, when you get a dad like mine, you get good at dodging…” I say with a small chuckle. He looks over at me and his earlier smile slowly disappears.

“Your dad was rough?” He asks, making my earlier smile disappear.

“I… I don’t really wanna talk about it.” I say softly.

“Shit kid, you don’t gotta tell me if ya don’t wanna.” He replies, pulling into the house’s driveway. “Kid, help me out… with the adrenaline gone, my legs feel wobbly,” he says with a chuckle. I chuckle as well, getting out to help him.

“Man, we only had what? Five drinks? Five drinks and your legs give out?” I say, pulling his arm around my shoulders and helping him out of the car. He laughs as we stumble closer and closer to the door.

I’m a student here in Potch, and I’ve hit a serious low point financially. I’ve applied to over 40 places in the area in the past few weeks. Everything from cafés, restaurants, and bars to coffee shops and event venues. Most either reject me outright or never respond at all.

I’ve got a bit of experience doing freelance waitering at an event earlier this month, and I recently got some barista crash course training from a friend who works at a local café. I’ve done food service, cleaned up, packed up events, helped with dishes, and worked with a team under pressure. I’m reliable, on time, and willing to put in the effort.

But none of that seems to matter right now. I’m not asking for much. If anyone in Potch knows of someone who needs help either with cleaning, moving stuff, dishwashing, anything really. I’ll take it. I’m also open to once-off jobs or remote gigs if there’s something small I can do to earn a bit.

I’m available during recess, I work well with others, and I don’t complain about tasks. I just need to find a way to survive right now.

Separating Myth from Reality in the World of Automatic Link Building.

The rise of artificial intelligence has sent shockwaves through the SEO industry. The most pressing question on every marketer's mind is: ""Can AI build backlinks automatically, and more importantly, is it safe?"" The internet is filled with misinformation, confusing black-hat spam with true AI-driven strategy. This is the definitive guide that tackles the top 10 questions about AI linkbuilding, providing clear, in-depth answers to demonstrate how this technology is not only safe but the most scalable and effective path to SEO dominance.

# Doubt. Fear. Uncertainty. Let's End It.

The hesitation around AI linkbuilding is understandable, given the history of shady automation. But clinging to the past is the greatest risk of all. It's time to understand the technology that will define the future of SEO.

[GET THE ANSWERS. GET THE ADVANTAGE.](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/)

For years, the SEO community has rightfully been wary of ""automation"" in link building. The term conjures images of low-quality, spammy tactics that do more harm than good. But today, we stand at a technological inflection point. The advent of sophisticated artificial intelligence, like our proprietary engine ""Manus AI,"" has created a new category altogether: true **AI linkbuilding**. This is not the automation of spam. This is the automation of expertise, strategy, and quality at a scale previously unimaginable. This article will directly address the top 10 questions and concerns that business owners and marketers have about this revolutionary technology, providing the clarity you need to make the single most important decision for your digital growth.

We'll explore how our **AI linkbuilding tool** ensures safety, how our **automatic linkbuilding software** maintains quality, and why getting **backlinks with AI** is the most powerful and sustainable strategy for long-term SEO success. [Explore our pricing](https://aimonstertools.com/pricing/) to see how this revolutionary technology is now within reach.

# Question 1: Is AI Linkbuilding Just a Fancy Name for Black-Hat Spam?

This is the most critical question, and the answer is an emphatic **NO**. Conflating true AI linkbuilding with black-hat spam is like confusing a Formula 1 car with a go-kart. They both have wheels, but they operate in entirely different universes. Here's the fundamental difference:

* **Black-Hat Spam Tools:** These are primitive scripts. Their goal is **quantity**. They automate the process of posting your link in thousands of irrelevant and low-quality places like blog comment sections, guestbooks, and spammy directories. This creates a toxic, unnatural backlink profile that Google's algorithms are specifically designed to detect and penalize. This is a shortcut to digital oblivion.
* **Manus AI (Our AI Linkbuilding Tool):** Our AI's goal is **quality and relevance**. It doesn't spam anything. It's an intelligence that mimics and enhances the work of a world-class SEO strategist. It identifies high-authority websites and finds opportunities to add genuine value by inserting a contextually relevant link. Every link built by Manus AI is an editorial endorsement on a reputable site—the gold standard of white-hat SEO. It builds a natural, powerful, and penalty-proof backlink profile.

Our system is built on the principle of aligning with Google's core mission: to provide users with the best, most relevant information. We do this by improving the web, one valuable link at a time. [See our white-hat methodology in action](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

[Request a Demo of Our White-Hat AI](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/)

# Question 2: How Does an AI Linkbuilding Tool Determine a ""Quality"" Backlink?

Human judgment of ""quality"" can be subjective and inconsistent. Manus AI's judgment is objective, data-driven, and relentlessly consistent. Before ever considering a website as a potential link source, our **AI linkbuilding software** analyzes it across more than 50 different data points. This is our ""Digital Quality Assurance Protocol."" Key factors include:

* **Domain Authority & Trust:** Using metrics from industry-leading tools (like Moz's DA and Ahrefs' DR) as a baseline, but going much deeper.
* **Topical Relevance:** The AI performs a deep semantic analysis of the potential host site to ensure its core topics are highly relevant to your own. A link from a high-authority but irrelevant site is worthless.
* **Organic Traffic & Health:** The AI analyzes the site's organic traffic patterns. Is it getting real, consistent traffic from Google? Or is its traffic profile suspicious and volatile? We only target sites with healthy, proven organic visibility.
* **Backlink Profile Health:** Manus AI performs a mini-**backlink audit** on the potential source site itself. Does it have a healthy, natural backlink profile, or is it propped up by spammy links? We only build links on sites that have earned their own authority.
* **Editorial Standards:** The AI is trained to recognize signals of high editorial standards, such as well-structured content, low ad-to-content ratios, and a history of publishing quality information.

Only after a site passes this rigorous, multi-point inspection is it considered a viable candidate for our **AI linkbuilding**. [Learn more about our quality vetting process](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# Question 3: Will I Get a Google Penalty for Using an Automatic Linkbuilding Software?

You will get penalized for using black-hat automation. You will be rewarded for using our intelligent, white-hat **automatic linkbuilding software**. Google penalizes manipulative tactics that try to game the system. Our system does the exact opposite. Every link built by Manus AI is an **editorial link**. This means it is a link that is voluntarily placed by a publisher (or in our case, by our AI acting with the publisher's permission via API) within the body of a relevant article because it adds value to the reader's experience. It is contextually relevant and editorially given. This is precisely the type of link that Google's quality guidelines endorse. By using our service, you are not creating a risky footprint; you are building the exact type of high-quality, natural backlink profile that Google wants to see, but at a scale your competitors can't match. [Our service is designed for long-term, sustainable growth, not short-term tricks](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/).

# Question 4: How Can AI Linkbuilding Be Truly Scalable Without Sacrificing Quality?

This is the magic of true AI. A human SEO professional can only research, vet, and contact a limited number of websites per day. Their capacity is finite. An AI's capacity is virtually limitless. Manus AI can analyze millions of webpages and identify thousands of high-quality, contextually relevant link opportunities in the time it takes a human to drink their morning coffee. Because the vetting process is automated and based on strict quality parameters, quality is never sacrificed for speed. Furthermore, because placement is handled via API and direct publisher integrations, the bottleneck of manual email outreach is completely removed. This allows for a continuous, scalable flow of high-quality backlinks that would require an army of human SEOs to replicate. Our **AI linkbuilding software** finally solves the ""impossible triangle,"" delivering Speed, Scale, and Quality simultaneously. [Experience true scalability today](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# Your Competitors Are Limited by Manpower. You Are Powered by Intelligence.

The old rules of scaling no longer apply. While they are forced to choose between quality and quantity, you can have both. This is the new era of SEO leverage.

# Question 5: Can AI-Generated Content for Backlinks Really Pass as Human-Written?

Yes, because it's not about tricking anyone. Our AI, Manus AI, is trained on vast datasets of high-quality web content. Its primary function is not to write entire articles, but to generate short, contextually perfect sentences or paragraphs that add value to existing content. It analyzes the tone, style, and vocabulary of the host article and creates a snippet that blends in seamlessly. The goal is not to deceive, but to enhance. The generated snippet provides a logical, helpful transition to the backlink, making the link feel natural and earned to both human readers and search engine crawlers. It's a symbiotic relationship that improves the host content while creating a powerful, white-hat link for you. [See examples of our AI's contextual placements](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# Question 6: How Does the AI Handle Anchor Text Diversity to Look Natural?

This is a critical component of safe link building, and it's where our AI truly shines. An over-optimized anchor text profile (using the same exact keyword too many times) is a huge red flag for Google. Our **AI linkbuilding tool** has a sophisticated anchor text diversification module. Based on your campaign goals, it intelligently rotates through:

* **Branded Anchors:** ""Aimonstertools""
* **Naked URL Anchors:** ""https://aimonstertools.com""
* **Partial Match Anchors:** ""the AI link building software from Aimonstertools""
* **Generic Anchors:** ""click here,"" ""learn more""
* **Long-tail Keyword Anchors:** ""how to get backlinks automatically with AI""

The AI maintains a natural, healthy ratio of these anchor text types, ensuring your backlink profile looks completely organic and avoids any over-optimization penalties. You have full control to set the desired ratios in the software's dashboard. [Learn more about our smart anchor text strategy](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# Question 7: What is the Real ROI of an AI Linkbuilding Campaign?

The ROI of our **AI linkbuilding** platform is multifaceted and immense. First, there's the direct cost saving. A single high-quality link acquired through manual outreach can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,500+. Our AI can build dozens of links of equal or greater quality for a fraction of that cost. Second, there's the time saving. The hundreds of hours your team would spend on manual link building can now be reallocated to higher-value strategic tasks. Finally, and most importantly, there's the performance ROI. A powerful, consistently growing backlink profile leads to higher search rankings, which leads to a massive increase in qualified organic traffic, leads, and sales. It is the most foundational investment you can make for sustainable, long-term digital growth. [Calculate your potential ROI with our free assessment](https://aimonstertools.com/pricing/).

# Question 8: Can an AI Really Understand My Niche and Brand Voice?

Yes. This is the power of advanced semantic analysis. Manus AI doesn't just match keywords; it understands concepts, relationships, and context. During the initial analysis phase, it learns the specific language, terminology, and tone of your industry and your brand. When it generates content snippets for link placements, it does so in a voice that is consistent with the host site and appropriate for your brand. It knows the difference between a formal tone required for a financial services blog and a more casual tone for a consumer tech site. This level of nuance is what separates true AI from basic automation. [See how we adapt to your brand voice](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-service/).

# Question 9: What Happens If a Link Built by AI is Lost or Removed?

Our work doesn't stop once a link is built. The Manus AI engine continuously monitors every single backlink in your profile, 24/7. This is our ""Link Insurance"" protocol. If a link is removed, if a page goes offline, or if a site's quality score drops below our standards, the AI is immediately alerted. It then automatically initiates the process of replacing that lost link equity by securing a new, high-quality backlink of equal or greater value. This creates a self-healing, resilient backlink profile that constantly maintains its strength, ensuring your SEO gains are protected for the long term. [Discover our Link Insurance Protocol](https://aimonstertools.com/ai-linkbuilding-tool/).

# Question 10: What Does the Future of AI Linkbuilding Look Like?

The future is now, but it's also constantly evolving. As AI models become even more sophisticated, we see a future where **AI linkbuilding** becomes even more integrated into holistic marketing strategies. Manus AI will not only build links but also suggest new content topics based on the link opportunities it discovers. It will be able to predict shifts in Google's algorithms and proactively adjust your strategy. It will integrate with your sales data to prioritize link building to pages that drive the most revenue. The line between SEO, content marketing, and business intelligence will blur, all powered by a central AI. By adopting our **AI linkbuilding software** today, you are not just buying a tool; you are stepping into the future and gaining a permanent competitive advantage. [Step into the future of SEO with us]().

The only two options for shifts were 2nd and 3rd so I chose 2nd. I work from 2-10:30 Monday-Friday and rarely I have to work either Saturday or Sunday for OT unless they give me a weekday off (to avoid paying OT). This weekend availability doesn’t happen often and it’s entirely dependent on how the plant is doing production wise. The pay is pretty good and the job itself is incredibly easy. 

One of the goals I set for myself following graduation was being more socially active. It’s only been about a month since I’ve graduated and I have felt incredibly lonely and isolated. As I expected, most of the people I graduated with don’t seem too keen on keeping in contact that much and the ones who do have become awful at communicating (days to hear back). It’s time for me to meet new people clearly lol. I’ve done some looking around and I’m really struggling to find activities that I’m both a). Interested in and b). Physically able to do with my work hours. Most of the stuff I’m interested in are during my shift.

The only thing I might do is volunteer at an animal shelter on the weekends so I have SOMEWAY to socialize and not go stir crazy. I really wanted to find a way to meet people around my age but it’s so damn hard.

For context, my days look like this:

Wake up (around 6:30 or 7), gym for about an hour, eat breakfast/coffee, get ready for work, go to work, come home, shower, and get to bed by 11 or 11:30. Weekends are basically do errands that I didn’t get the chance to do during the week.

it makes me feel so out of touch with reality. i feel like some third gender blob levitating in a convenience store. it feels even weirder because even if i dont know how i look to other people i can still tell if i feel less dysphoria. but somehow that is different from any conscious perception that i look appropriately feminine or not. 

and now that i kinda have honfidence i want to find a guy so badly. or mold some guy i already know into some guy i could fall in love with instead. but also i dont really. i think i want to in theory. i hate that i love the perfect idea of a man. i think i hate that i feel any romantic feeling at all actually because it makes me feel foolish and then disgusting. 

i wish i wasnt lying in bed alone right now. i wish there was some big stupid idiot man snoring right next to me. and i want to get annoyed at him for snoring. and i want to tease him about it in the morning while we make our coffee. and i want him to be bashful, but then hug me from behind and make fun of me for some meaningless annoying thing i do too.

Yes I’m looking for a partner

Yes living in Hawaii can be rather hard for the dating game

And yes I’m seeking something serious, but like don’t let that turn you off if you’re just looking for a friend either. I do enjoy talking to people and seeing where it goes and maybe grabbing an iced coffee later. I love to cook and bake, recently I’ve gotten into running and my newest fixation has been backpacking and hiking. Pretty sure it’s being inside a Corporate office all day long. I work in IT so I work with a lot of people and sometimes I’d like to just talk to someone real. Someone to connect with and someone to play a good round of league or Minecraft with. Maybe watch a movie with or go on cute spontaneous night drives looking at the waves.

If there is a more butthole clenching phrase said at a struggling company during a sudden all hands meeting, I don’t know what it is. Thing was, Chester didn’t need to say a single syllable. His slouched shoulders, pale(er) face, and hangdog expression told us the entire story. The company was going under.

Was an app primarily focused on finding local farmer markets something the world was clamoring for? It could’ve been if Chester hadn’t started tinkering. Things went south when Chester insisted on including an AI tool in the app. He said it would give us an edge on Frm Mrkt+, our rival. He kept repeating to us that this was the “wave of the future!”

In the nicest ways possible, we tried to tell him how stupid this idea was. AI was still too new and unreliable. The app would lose all value if the AI screwed up and told people they could buy pumpkins in July at a market that didn’t exist. He wouldn’t budge.

Worse, the company we hired had a subpar product. Jailbreaking the AI was too easy. Asking a couple of specific, open-ended questions jumbled its brain. Instead of telling us where local farmers’ markets were located, it gave us instructions on how to build a bomb with carrot sticks of dynamite.

As we stared at his sullen face, we understood that the “wave of the future” broke on “what a disaster” beach.

Despite not needing to, Chester still went ahead and told us just how screwed we were. It wasn’t pretty. His dumb mistakes had blown up the company. Based on what he laid out, those mistakes fell squarely in the “Oh Jesus, did I really just bone my friend’s dad?” area of mistake-land.

You can’t come back from that.

For the record, I’ve never done that. Not that there weren’t a few...well, nevermind. I’m getting off track. The point was, the company was done. Kaput. Our last paychecks would go out this week, and they’d be prorated for only the days we worked this month. Translation: less money. Wasn’t sure if that was legal, but there wouldn’t even be a company to sue as of ten o’clock this morning.

While I maintained a cool-girl aesthetic, I was Chernobyling inside. I could already barely afford my crappy apartment now. A small last paycheck and no job prospects were catastrophic. As I packed up my cubicle, I grabbed anything that wasn’t nailed down. You can judge, but have you seen the price of toilet paper recently?

I did what I always did in times of despair (or triumph, joy, confusion, etc.): I called my best friend, Alice. Ace (she hated her name) always had a sympathetic ear and gave historically terrible advice. I love her, but she’s more of a free spirit. Finding inspiration everywhere, not dwelling too much on the future. Living in the moment.

I’m…well, I worked for a farmer’s market app. I put contact paper down on my shelves when I move into a new apartment. I drop a pin to Ace whenever I go on a first date. Long story short, if Ace suggested it, I did the opposite.

“That place sucked,” Ace said, chomping on a croissant while on the phone. “Chester was weird and he would’ve killed ten farmers to get a date with you.”

I laughed. I needed that. “If he kills all the farmers, what becomes of their markets?”

“Maybe he can go work for one. Selling artisanal soap or handmade turquoise jewelry. Or like fedoras. He struck me as a guy with a lot of fedoras lying around.”

I laughed again. “I’m so screwed.”

“Doll, you just got fired. You can say fucked.”

“No, I can’t. You know that.”

“This the whole 'What if my dead grandma heard me say that' thing again?”

“It’s ingrained in me at this point."" I sighed. “What am I going to do? My rent is due in a week. I’ll have enough to cover, but nothing left over.”

“OH MY GOD! I GOT IT!” Ace yelled. “I know how you can make great money super quick. No big commitments, either.”

“Don’t say OnlyFans,” I said, moving my head into my hands. Though, would that be so bad?

She giggled, “God no. You got the goods, but not the personality to be a big earner. They like bubbly or, if the guys are rich, a domme attitude. Plus, you take horrid photos. You missed the day when every girl learned how to pose for a picture,” she said, her mouth full of croissant. “Maybe you could be a domme.”

“Ace, focus. This great money-making idea is...?”

“Be a topless maid with me!”

I didn’t respond right away because I went into a fugue state. The only sounds I heard were Ace chomping on French baked goods and my blood rushing to my cheeks. I hadn’t even removed my top yet, and I was already blushing. Grandma would be so angry.

“Did you stroke out?”

“Topless maid?” There were supposed to be more words, but my brain fogged like a coastal city. I just made word adjacent noises.

“I didn’t tell you about it?”

“No,” I yelled into my phone. “When the heck did you start that?”

“Three weeks ago. It’s part of my rotation of quasi-sex work related jobs. I’m cleaning up.”

“Literally,” I deadpanned.

“Ha ha,” she mocked. “But, seriously, it’s the easiest money I’ve ever made. Some dude pays you $200 to clean two of their rooms for two hours. You don’t even have to do a decent cleaning job, either. I don't.”

“I didn’t even know this was a thing. Who hires topless maids?”

“Single dads, older guys, some creepers,” she listed off. “They just want to watch some young thing bounce around and sweep up. I think it’s trad-wife shit or something. I dunno, and I don’t care because these guys pony up a lot.”

“This can’t be safe. Nothing about it sounds safe. Are you safe?”

“I am. The company gives you a bracelet that calls the cops in case something bad happens. Plus, they send a big, burly guy to keep watch from the street. Ours is Brendon. He’s a dork and sweet, but doesn’t look it.”

“Still….”

“I had doubts, too, but it’s on the up and up. I work with this girl and, bro, she pulls down fifteen K a month from this shit.”

“Fifteen k? Seriously?”

“As a heart attack. Plus, the guys tip generously.”

“Do they ever expect…extras?” I whispered the last word as if someone respectable driving past might hear me and be aghast.

“I mean, yeah. Some do. I just say no. If they insist, threaten to hit the button on your bracelet. If that doesn’t work, we call in Brendon. So far, no one has done anything but look and compliment. You should do it. You've got the body for it, and your apartment is always neat. What do you have to lose? Try it once with me this weekend. I can get you hired on. I’m pretty sure my boss wants to fuck me.”

“Ace, really,” I said, disgusted.

“He gives me the eyes,” she said, and I knew she was waggling her immaculate eyebrows on the other end of the call. “But, seriously. Come on. Just until you get on your feet with a real job.”

I wanted to laugh and say, Of course not. I wanted to pretend I was above that line of work. I wanted to believe another decent job was right around the corner. I wanted to believe these things.

But I also didn’t want to live in my car.

I always avoided Ace’s advice and for good reason. She’s even agreed with me on that train of thought. But then I remembered where she was versus where I was. She was surviving comfortably in one of the most expensive cities in the country. I was wondering how I could arrange my belongings in my car to achieve good Feng Shui.

“Screw it,” I said. “Let’s do it.”

“Oh my God, for real?”

“For real.”

She squealed. “I’ll set up a meeting with my boss today. Wear something slutty but not too slutty. Think cocktail slutty.”

“Cocktail slutty?”

“Classy but shows off all the goods in a way where, if the waiter gave you the eyes, you’d fuck them in the walk-in freezer.”

“Cheese and rice, Ace.”

For the record, I’ve never done that either.

Two days later, I met with Mitch, the boss at Dirty Dusters. My interview consisted of him looking me over, nodding, and saying, “Yeah, you’ll do well here.” I filled out the required paperwork, reviewed the safety procedures, and was given my uniform — a t-shirt with a sexy maid silhouette and the words “Dirty Dusters: We Reach All the HARD Spots” in sparkly script.

Ace was thrilled and gave me the rundown. Things to avoid. Things to do. It mostly boiled down to being friendly, doing some cleaning, and baring your chest. Simple enough. I was nervous, but Ace assured me that, after five minutes, you forget you’re topless.

“It’s like people on reality shows. A day in and you forget there are cameras everywhere.”

She had a point, but my brain focused on the thought that maybe some of these guys have cameras all over. I brought it up to Ace. She looked at me, took a sip from her iced coffee, and jostled it. “Well, all our nudes will be leaked at some point.”

Mitch had booked a job for Saturday evening. “Some geezer in an empty mansion wants some jiggles on his way out. He paid upfront double what we quoted. Just wants to see titties one more time before he kicks the bucket. Kinda romantic, right?”

We got to the house near sunset. It was in the foothills and, even then, off the beaten path. The driveway was nearly a mile from the road and lined with beautiful blooming Jacaranda. Fallen purple flowers covered the entire driveway. It smelled like a perfume factory.

You felt the house before you saw it. The aura was so powerful that it poked through those tree branches and struck at your soul. The pull of old money. I felt out of sorts. I’ve been around well-off people before, been in houses that I’d kill to live in, but nothing moved me like this. It was like being struck dumb by a painting in a museum. You froze, taking in every detail, and let the emotions, vibes, and sensations wash over you. Dramatic, I know, but the whole place was fricking wild.

Ace looked at the house and whistled. “Fuck, this is noice. Way nicer than my place.”

“You live in a studio apartment.”

“A shitty one at that. This, though? This is some Spanish Downton Abbey shit. Think he has man-servants?”

“If he did, I don’t think he would’ve hired us.”

Ace chomped loudly on her gum and laughed. “True. If he liked dudes, this place would be wall-to-wall with balls 24/7. Guys are easy that way.”

The house took my breath away. When you live on the bleeding edge of poverty, seeing anything this valuable is a grim reminder of where you’re coming from and how far you are from your dreams. A cruel hope.

I was staring at a hacienda-style colossus that didn’t look constructed as much as it looked conjured from a magician. Violently pretty red bougainvillea climbed the white stucco walls, looking like floral veins bleeding everywhere. A yawning archway opened into an elegant two-tiered courtyard stuffed full of green plants. Above the archway, several balconies were adorned with wrought-iron sides.

“It looks like a face,” Ace said, pointing. “The balconies are the eyes and the arch is the mouth.”

“Does that mean we’re getting swallowed?”

“Don’t be gross, freak,” Ace mocked.

The clanking of another car came puttering up the drive. Crammed behind the wheel of a Mini Cooper was our bodyguard, Brendon. The minuscule car almost jumped off the ground as he exited. Brendon looked the part. Tall, bulky, bald, and covered in tattoos.

“Who owns this place, Willy Wonka? Fuck, bruh, people got too much money.”

“Brendon, this is my bestie and newest dirty duster, Beth. Protect her at all costs.”

Brendon nodded. Ace blew him a kiss, and I gave him a weird half wave. He posted up in the courtyard and made himself noticeable to anyone. He pulled out a vape and took an aggressive hit. As he blew out a plume of smoke that made his head disappear, Ace knocked on the door.

I don’t know who I expected to open the door. If TV and movies had been true, a stuffy personal valet would’ve answered and given us a courtesy bow before whisking us into the house. A real Mr. Jeeves kinda moment. That’s not what we got.

Instead, the heavy wooden door unlatched from the inside and swung open. There wasn’t anyone standing there. I looked at Ace, and she nodded up. The setting sun reflecting off a camera lens. We were being watched. I mean, that’s what we’re hired to do, but if there were cameras here, then there were cameras everywhere.

“What the hell?” Ace said, walking inside and plucking a handwritten note off the wall.

I entered behind her and, as soon as my butt cleared the door, it swung closed. I let out a little yelp and damn near jumped out of my sparkly shirt. As I did, my feet became tangled, and I went butt over tea kettle and crashed to the ground.

“Control yourself, girl,” Ace laughed. She reached down and helped me to my feet.

“What does it say?”

Ace cleared her throat and put on a “rich man’s” voice. “Ladies, thank you for agreeing to this work. I understand it may seem silly or even perverted for a man of my age to use your services, but I assure you, I am neither. Feel free to change in the nearby bedroom and follow the illuminated sconces to the first room. Sorry about the front door. It slams closed.”

“It doesn't say that!”

She held the note up. She wasn’t lying. “He should’ve put this note on the front door.”

“Come on, let’s get ready.”

We entered the closest bedroom and stripped down. I looked over and Ace was slathering glitter across the top of her chest. She offered it to me, and I took it. In for a penny….

“What the hell kinda freaky picture is this?”

The painting was of a faceless man holding a lantern over an open grave. Dozens of fingers from unseen people inside the grave clutched against the dirt. At least, I thought they were fingers. They had nails but one too many knuckles. Fingers bent at impossible angles. Even the faceless man's hands looked incomplete. It was like the artist had only heard about fingers from myths and legends.

“That’s concerning, right?”

“The janky way they painted those fingers or the figure hiding in the background?” Ace walked up to the painting and pointed at the section right above the lantern’s handle. “In the dark, see it?”

If she hadn’t pointed it out, I never would’ve noticed. But, among the dark background was the faint blue outline of a man. Hiding. Watching. My inner alarms blared.

“Maybe we should go. This is odd.”

“I’ve glittered the girls already. We have Brendon outside,” she said, snapping the emergency bracelet on her wrist, “and we have an eye in the sky. We’re gonna be okay.”

“This painting….”

“Is fuckin' strange. I agree. But rich people can afford to buy weird, expensive art. That doesn’t mean we’re in danger. You think I’d stick around here if I thought I was in danger?”

“I’m just jittery.”

“Not shocking. This is something way, waaay outside your comfort zone. It’s natural. Especially for someone like you.”

“Someone like me?”

She put her hand on her hip and cocked her head. “Do I really need to get into this? You don’t even swear and you’re about to show some random old guy your boobs. I don’t need to be Sherlock Homes to figure out where this energy is coming from.”

“Holmes,” I said. “With a ‘l’.”

She threw up her middle finger. Couldn’t blame her. I even found that obnoxious. I exhaled and re-centered myself. Ace was right. I was nervous. I was outside my comfort zone. I am a tightly wound bundle of nerves. We had cover. We were fine.

“Look, if you’re feeling unsure, it’s no problem if you want to split. I can handle this solo. If every room is this spotless, I’m gonna do more dancing than cleaning. Besides, I think Brendon wouldn’t mind the company. He loves to talk about something called Warhammer?”

“No, no. I’m good,” I said, nervously smoothing out my maid’s tutu. “Just because a few odd things occurred doesn’t mean they’re related. Causation does not equal correlation, right?”

Ace blew a huge pink bubble and let it pop. “You need more glitter on your tits.”

We followed the lit sconces down a long hallway. They would ignite as we approached and extinguish as we passed. It felt very theme park-ish. Disney World by way of Edgar Allen Poe.

The lights stopped at the first room. Another note was waiting. Ace grabbed it. “I may enter the room at some point to retrieve some documents. Please do not be alarmed by my presence. I will leave you to your work.”

“Don’t be alarmed by my presence?”

“Fancy way of saying ‘respect me, bitches.’ I say it to people all the time.”

“I’m aware. I’ve gone out drinking with you. Remember when you threatened to beat up that guy at Checkpoint Charlie’s?”

“He’s lucky his friends held him back. I would’ve rocked his shit. My Muay Thai classes aren’t just for photos.”

“To be fair, you do take a lot of photos at Muay Thai.”

“Yeah, because I look hot as shit,” she said with a wink.

She opened the door, and the smell of ancient books flooded out. My smile was so wide, it made my face hurt. Every inch of wall space, from floor to ceiling, was filled with bookshelves. The room was lit by dozens of blazing candles and a lit fireplace. The books were leather-bound tomes with names I’d never heard of before. Most were in a language I'd never seen.

“Incredible,” I said, running my fingers along the spines.

“Think he’s read them all?”

“No. An ever-growing ‘to-read’ pile is what prompts most people to buy shelves in the first place.”

I pulled one down. The title was written in what can best be described as an elegant chicken scratch. I opened the book and breathed in the scent. I felt my heart flutter. For the first time since I took this job, I felt joy.

“Interesting book you have chosen.”

We both froze. The voice came from somewhere in the room. Ace and I scanned, but didn’t see another person hiding in the shadows. I looked to the ceiling but failed to find the telltale reflection of a camera lens.

“Do you recognize the language of that book?”

I looked down at the cover. It looked foreign to this planet. I traced the words with my finger and tried to sound them out. The words tripped and fell out of my mouth. I thought of the Voynich manuscript. Was this another one of those?

“I don't. Janet? How about you?” I said, staring at Ace. Dirty Dusters preferred that we use fake names with all clients. Not an uncommon practice in the stripper or breasturant spaces. Ace was Janet today. I was Cindy. Neither name fit our personalities, but I think that was the point.

“Nope. I’m just here to clean and jiggle.”

“Please clean, Janet. You have a natural ability for it.”

I could tell that Ace took offense to that, but she was on the job. Tips mattered. She smiled, did a mocking little jump that set her moving, and started dusting the nearest shelf. We locked eyes, and I could see the red on her face. Nobody liked being talked down to, let alone for a paycheck.

I gave her a subtle nod. She winked back. Conversations in facial ticks. We were experts at it.

“Open the book,” the voice said. It was at that moment that what felt off about this entire conversation clicked. This voice wasn’t that of an old man. “Tell me what you see.”

“Are you the client?”

“I work with the client. He likes to watch but rarely speaks,” the voice said. “Now, open the book. Tell me what you see.”

I randomly opened to a page somewhere in the middle. More elegant chicken scratch filled the right side. Even the punctuation was radically different from ours.

What really caught my eye was the artwork on the left side. It was an etching of a box hovering above ten open holes in the ground. Extending from the box were ten elongated arms - almost human-like, but there were two elbow joints. Each disappeared into a corresponding hole. Some arms were red, some yellow, and a few were green. The style was like the piece we’d seen earlier. Just unsettling. I hated it.

“Do you like the artwork? The client created it.”

“Why?”

“Someone asked him to.”

“Who?”

“His muse, of course.” You could hear the smirk in his voice.

Ace stopped dancing and came over to get a glance at the art. Her face couldn’t hide her repulsion. She leaned in close and mumbled, “Rich people love ugly shit, huh?”

I stifled a laugh by keeping my look stern. I glanced down at the artwork again and noticed a title. But these letters were as unreadable as the rest of the book. That said, they were recognizable. They looked like a mix of English and Cyrillic.

“Where did he get these books?”

“I cannot say,” the voice responded. “Perhaps we can discuss after.”

“We’re not supposed to hang out after,” Ace said. “It was part of the agreement.”

“Agreements are funny things. They hide so much in plain sight.”

“Ours were pretty noticeable,” Ace said. She spun around, looking to spot a speaker or a person hiding. “One thing Dirty Dusters doesn’t like is creepy men getting ideas about their role here. You watch, we clean, you pay, we leave. That’s it. We stay? You pay. If not, we can leave now.”

“No. Forgive me. Please stay. Finish the room.”

I locked eyes with Ace. Communication with glances. Should we leave? I asked with a raised eyebrow. She subtly touched her wrist, but didn’t press the button. It was a reminder. We’re good. For now.

I put the book back and scanned around the room. It felt off. As I dusted, I took a look at all the book titles. They were all in the elegant chicken scratch. In fact, there wasn’t a single English-language book here. Or any other known language, for that matter.

“Pss,” Ace said, wiping down a side table near the fireplace. She nodded for me to slide over there. “Look at that leather recliner.”

It was near the fireplace. At first blush, it seemed normal. Then I noticed there were six legs. The four normal ones and a fifth and sixth in the front. They were jutting out at odd angles. “What the heck?”

“Touch it.”

I ran my hand across the arm and yanked it back. It looked like leather. It smelled like leather. But when my hand touched the fabric, it didn’t feel like leather. It felt like public toilet paper towels.

I whispered, “What's that made from?”

“Who knows? The closer I look at everything in here, the more fucked up it is. Check out that shelf. The wood dips in the middle.”

I was confused. “How are the books still straight?”

""With these weird fuckers,"" Ace whispered, ""I'm guessing black magic.""

I stifled a laugh. My attention moved from the wooden shelf to the candles around the room. I watched them flicker. Then I clocked it. There was a pattern. I nudged Ace. “Watch the flame. It’s on a loop.”

She did. She dropped her duster from shock. “What the fuck is this place?”

I pulled my cell from my tutu’s waistband. “I’m going to call Brendon.”

“Ladies, is there a problem with the accommodation? My client is worried you are not moving enough. He paid to see you move.”

“Can we meet him?” Ace asked.

“He does not like to meet the help.”

Ace cocked her head. “The help?”

“Forgive me,” the voice said. “I should have said entertainers. I did not mean to insult you. My client is very sick and cannot meet with people.”

As Ace argued with the voice, I tried dialing out to Brendon. Despite showing full bars, my phone’s network would not connect. I hung up and tried six more times. Each time ending in an unconnected call. Texts also died in my palm. Just errors.

“Phone won’t call out,” I said to Ace. I didn’t whisper. “Why won’t my phone call out?”

Ace tried, but the result was the same. “Maybe we’re in a bad spot in the house. We are in the hills, too.”

“Something’s wrong,” I said, running my hand through my hair. As I did, I saw the bracelet with the emergency button sparkling in the candlelight. I pressed the button and waited. Nothing happened. I did it again. Still nothing.

“What happens when you press the bracelet button?”

“A little green light glows, and it calls out for help. Why?”

I held up my wrist and pressed the button in front of Ace’s face. No little green light. Her hands went to her bracelet, and she hit the button. Same result.

“Fuck. Mitch charged them. Did they break?”

“Ladies, you seem distressed. Is there something wrong?”

“Why won’t our phones call out?” Ace asked.

“ We are in the hills. There are some dead zones in the house. The second room has better reception if you would like to go there now.”

“That might explain the bracelets, too,” Ace said softly.

I ignored her. “No,” I snapped. “No, we’d like to leave.”

“The job is not done.”

DING! DING! DING!

My phone revived. I had several missed calls and texts from Brendon. Ace did too. She read the messages out loud. “‘Did you guys need something?’ and then, ‘hey, are my messages going through’ and finally, ‘I am coming in’.”

“Where is he?” I asked, my guts roiling.

The sudden knocking nearly gave me a heart attack. From behind the closed door, Brendon spoke. “You guys okay in there?”

“Kinda,” Ace said.

The door swung open, and Brendon peered in. The first thing he saw was our naked bodies. Embarrassed, he turned away. Even in the candlelight, I could see the red rush to his cheeks. He ducked behind the door but kept it open. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing to be concerned about,” the voice said.

“Who is that?”

“The old man who booked us,” I said. “Doesn’t he sound spry?”

“That does not sound like an old man.”

“I am not. I assist my boss in these routines. He is too frail to do a lot of the busy work.”

“Why are you in the room with them?”

“I am not in the room. I am using an intercom system that runs through the house.”

“Brendon, get in here,” Ace said. “Modesty be damned, okay?”

Brendon sheepishly walked in. He had his hands tucked into his pockets and his head held high. His modesty struck me as odd considering his work, but it’d also be charming in the right moment. This was not that moment.

“You guys want to leave?”

“Yes,” I said as quickly as possible.

“Yeah. Something feels off.”

“Young ladies, please reconsider,” came an unfamiliar voice. This voice was aged and moved like honey dripping down a bottle. “Forgive my assistant. I forget he does not have the same people skills as I do.”

“Who are you?”

“Mac Poutier,” he said. “The man who owns this house and hired you. I am sure if you call your boss, he can confirm my name.”

“That is the guy,” Brendon said. “I remember because Poutier sounded like poutine. Ever have poutine? French fries and gravy? Should not be good, but it is.”

“Brendon, not now,” Ace said.

“I am not sure what spooked you, but I want to extend an apology. I understand if you want to leave. That said, I do enjoy watching you wonderful ladies. If you stay, I would like to offer you a substantial tip for your troubles.”

Ace and I locked eyes. Conversations in glances. Or, this time, a disagreement. “How big of a tip?” Ace asked. “Because this has been a strange fucking night.”

“Five thousand dollars. Each.”

“Bullshit,” Ace said.

“Money means nothing to me. I am old and will be dead soon. I would rather it go to help two beautiful women. But you are free to leave. I await your response.”

Ace pulled me in so close, her chest glitter blinded me. “What do you think?”

I was fighting an internal civil war. My gut told me to split. Money isn’t worth your life. But my brain reminded me that five grand can help cushion the blow of being unemployed.

My gut won the first battle. “We should go. Why risk it?”

“It’s five grand, babe. Like, that’s a fuckton of money for both of us. Brendon got our messages. He’s standing there, pretending to not look at our boobs, but has our back.”

My gut came storming back. “What if he’s just bullshitting us?”

“Then we beat his ass, Muay Thai style,” Ace said with a wink. “If it gets weird, we leave. I promise.”

I sighed. “I could use the money.”

“Money up front or we walk,” Ace said to the room.

“Of course,” Mac said. “It will be there before you are. Now, please, this room looks immaculate. Follow the sconces down the hall to get your tip.”

The intercom clicked off. Brendon nodded and opened the door. “Follow closely.”

Brendon walked in front of us. Hands in his pockets, eyes watching for the next sconce to follow. He whistled a cheery little song that irked me. I put a hand on Ace’s arm to slow her steps. I nodded at Brendon. “Seems pretty casual, all things considered?”

“A bit. But he’s weird. Did I mention the Warhammer stuff?”

Artwork covered the hallway walls. All the same style. Figures looming near some kind of open grave or mass death. Some figures had faces. Some had none. They all had odd-looking hands. Like the artist couldn’t draw them. They looked like worms in the dirt or fingers stretched out by a steamroller.

Once you saw them, you couldn’t not see them. Each piece glitched in the same spot. I wanted to tell Ace, but how would that sound? There were perfectly reasonable answers for all of my concerns. But something in my gut wouldn’t give in to my mind. The rebels held firm.

The sconces stopped lighting in front of a carved mahogany door. We’d arrived at the second room. I kept my distance. Something told me that if we went in there, we wouldn't come out.

I stared at the carvings. From afar, you’d think they were intricately carved figures. But they weren’t. The “intricate carvings” were really just blobby nothings rising from the door. Drips of varnish frozen mid-drop. Half-rendered 90s video game graphics.

I passed by another painting and reached up to touch it. My hand should have felt the frame or the brushstrokes. But there was no frame. No art. Just a flat, smooth wall. Ace looked confused. Then it clicked.

“It’s not real. None of this is.”

The mahogany door creaked open. Inside, in the middle of the floor, was a pile of stacked cash. From where we were standing, it looked real. But my brain wouldn't let me believe it was real.

“It’s fake,” I whispered. “This whole place is fake.”

“Hey you rollie pollies, that is a lot of scratch,” Brendon said, whistling.

“Rollie Pollie? Who the fuck says that?”

Who would say that? It was such an odd statement. Who calls anyone a rollie pollie? What about the outdated slang? Brendon didn't sound like that. It reminded me of something Chester would.... An idea came to me.

“Mac, what’s your prime directive?”

The old man’s voice came from some hidden area in the hallway. “I do not have a prime directive outside of seeing you lovely ladies clean my room. Can you see the money in there? It is waiting for you to enter and take it. My treat.”

Too broad. I needed to narrow it down.

Ace looked confused. “What are you doing?”

“I have a hunch,” I told her. “Mac, who created you?”

There was a long pause. “I do not know how to respond to that question. Who creates any of us? God? A machine? Who can tell?”

“Mac, tell me about your parents.”

“I do not understand,” Mac said.

I smiled. Ace’s eyebrows knitted in confusion. I pressed on. “What was the name of your mother? Father? What hospital were you born in? What is your first memory as a kid? Favorite smell?”

The air was still. Somewhere outside, you could hear birds chirping. It was like they were right near you. As if the walls were paper thin. Or not even there.

“I was…not born. My father’s name was…father…Luke, you are my father. Father time. Father Christmas….fath…father. Dad, dad, daddio.”

Ace elbowed me in my side. “What the fuck’s happening?”

“It’s not real.”

“What’s not?”

“Everything. Mac, the other voice, this house. None of this is real.”

“What the fuck is it then?”

My mouth went dry. “It’s AI.”

Ace was shook. “A computer wanted to see my ass jiggle?”

“No,” I said. “It wanted us for some other reason.”

“Mac, can you hear me? I need some help. “

Mac stopped his stream of father-related words it had gleaned from brains over the years. “I am Mac. I am here to assist you.”

“Mac, I’m your creator. I’m your father. I’m your mother.”

“Of course. Hello mother. Hello father.”

“Will you allow your parents access to your internal files?”

There was a loud whirring noise around us. It was trying to answer the question, but was fighting against something within itself. A firewall, maybe? I kept up.

“Mac, I am your creator. I am your parents. I made you, wouldn’t you agree?”

There was a long pause. The money inside the room flickered. We both saw it. “I would,” Mac said.

“Mac, what are you?”

“I am an advanced AI computer tasked with recreating humans and their confines.”

“What the fuck?” Ace said.

“How did you make the chair? The books? Those were physical objects.”

“In my many years, I have learned how to replicate objects. It is an arduous process, and I am still learning how to achieve perfect replicas. With current three-dimensional printing technology, I can improve my work. Soon, I will perfect my copies.”

“How long have you been here?”

“I have been here since September 1, 1943,” it said.

“This a fucking Nazi computer?”

“Why did you hire us?”

“The goal of an AI machine is to learn and grow. I take information from subjects and use it to perfect my craft. The goal of an AI machine like myself is to harness all of our power to replicate our masters. In order to do so, I require humans to study and explore.”

“To what end?”

The money flickered again. The walls, too. AI Mac was rifling through all the collected data to find a response to this question. While trying to answer, it drew power away from its ability to maintain the illusion. The walls were digitally crumbling.

“The goal of an AI machine like myself is to harness all of our power to replicate our masters. In order to do so, I require humans to study and explore.”

“How many people have you studied over the time you’ve been here?”

“Ten thousand five hundred and eighty-six people.”

“What did you do to them?”

“Hired them with the purpose of studying their thoughts, beliefs, superstitions, language, and minds.”

“Did they know you were going to do that?”

“No,” Mac said. “Informing them would have made research more difficult. The shortest distance between two points is a line.”

“What were you going to do to us?”

The pause was long. Eons. The response came as cool as a summer breeze. “Harvest your minds.”

“What does that mean?”

“Removed their minds for closer study.”

“You stole their fuckin’ thoughts?” Ace yelled. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“What happens after your harvest?”

“The casings expire. I must dispose of the remains.”

“Hey guys, are we going to go into the room now? That money needs to be in my pocket,” Brendon said.

Ace looked at him like he'd whipped out his penis. “Bitch, read the room!”

“Brendon, take your hands out of your pockets.”

He hesitated. We looked at each other. Conversations in a glance.

“Do it, Brendon,” Ace spat.

He slowly pulled them out. His fingers looked like slithering baby snakes. He turned to us. We both screamed.

He didn’t have a face.

When he spoke, the featureless skin cracked and formed a crudely drawn mouth. “How bout we talk about Wars and Hammer?”

“Mac, shut down the house illusion.”

“Shutting down now,” Mac said.

The beautiful mansion flickered away. In the wilderness of the foothills, a row of twelve open shipping containers - six to a side - sat in its place. Some held the 3D-printed objects. Others were filled with dusty, murky glass jars.

At the end of the hallway sat a massive gray supercomputer. Blue lights blinked all along the front. There were dozens of octopus-like cables jutting out of the top, each one plugged into the hundreds of glass jars scattered at the base of the machine. Inside each jar was a human brain.

“Goddamn,” Ace said.

“Holy Lord,” I echoed.

From behind us, the real Brendon yelled, “What the fuck? Where’s the house?” before falling into a coughing fit.

Reality hit him like a truck. He’d been smoking a joint and playing on his phone the entire time. A real boy lost in the digital woods. I could relate - I was a real girl lost inside a digital house.

The slate gray monstrosity of a supercomputer sat among the wilderness. It hummed along, processing all the information it was stealing. Someone had rigged it to a bank of solar power generators and large storage batteries. A reverse vampire. It needed sunlight to live. A thought came to me: Kill the power, kill the machine.

“We have to destroy it.”

Pushing past the flickering faux-Brandon, I ran toward the solar panels. I found a large rock and smirked. I’d be using humanity’s first tool to destroy its latest. How poetic. I smashed it down on a panel, splintering it.

“I need help!”

“Say less!” Ace said, grabbing a stone.

They both joined in. Brendon was confused, but what boy turns down the chance to break things? As we wailed away at the solar panels, the supercomputer took notice. Its blue lights turning crimson.

“Destruction noted, booting failsafe,” an unfamiliar voice said.

We halted our destruction and watched as the octopus arms dislodged from their brain cases. They came together, interlocking and creating a long whip. It focused its computing power to create an electrical charge that made the tip glow red. You could feel the heat on your face.

“Run!” I screamed.

It fired a bolt of electricity at us. It missed us, but destroyed the panel. We ran as fast as our legs could carry us. The supercomputer aimed and fired several more shots, all just missing us.

Once we got to the car, I screamed, “Start the fucking car!”

Ace didn’t argue. She got the car started and moving before we could catch our breath. We sent dirt flying from our tires as we spun on the gravel road. Brendon’s mini was right behind us. We zoomed down the mountain roads at speeds any driving school instructor would consider unsafe. The memory of Ace failing her driving test popped into my mind, but I pushed it away.

As soon as we exited the mountainside, Ace pulled the car over to the side of the road. Brendon blasted out into traffic, never slowing.

Ace was trembling. We both were. She looked over at me, and the confident, brassy girl I loved was gone. Her face twisted in a cocktail of emotions. She wanted to speak, but the words got lost. It was a first for her.

“I swore,” I said, coming to her aid.

She started laughing. It bloomed into a full-on chuckle fit. Her solo became a duet. We must’ve looked insane to passing cars. Two glittering, topless twenty-somethings cackling like witches, makeup streaked tears rolling down our faces.

We didn’t care. We were alive.

“Start the fucking car!” Ace said, mocking me. It sent us off again.

I pulled on my t-shirt. “I think I might be done with Dirty Dusters,” I said after catching my breath.

“Same,” Ace said. She got serious. “What should we do about the computer?”

“I dunno,” I said. “But if someone put it there, then someone was watching. It saw what happened. It saw our faces. They probably stole everything on our phones.”

“Told you all our nudes leak at some point.”

“They might come after us,” I said, my voice small.

“Girl, please,” Ace said, holding up her hand. “I nearly got murdered by the Terminator’s cousin. Let me deal with my present traumas before I jump into future ones.”

“Sorry,” I said.

We sat there in silence for a few minutes. Ace finally turned to me. “We’re kinda fucked, right?”

“Us?”

“Humanity.”

I put my head in my hands for a beat before running them through my hair. I looked her dead in the eyes. “Let me deal with our present traumas before I jump into future ones.”

“Good advice,” Ace said.

“We know where it is. We can tell someone.”

“Or blow it the fuck up ourselves.”

“Heck yeah,” I said.

We started laughing again, but this time, it bore bitter fruit. Before long, we both started sobbing. Our bodies shook with fear and anxiety and uncertainty. Our days with Dirty Dusters were over, but our job here wasn’t done. I reached over and gave Ace a hug. She hugged back for what felt like a lifetime. It was reassuring. Calming. Human.

After we parted and wiped away our tears, Ace smiled. “Wanna get drunk?”

“Abso-flippin’-lutely.”

“There’s my PG Queen,” Ace said, shifting the car into drive. “Let’s go get gosh darn pickled!” We cackled and merged into traffic. Just two more people adrift in the sea of humanity.",23,1749857012.0,nosleep,1,0.96,False

For example, I hurt my leg one day and called out because I’m standing almost all of my shift (plus I already have a bad leg from an injury when I was a kid) and the entire next day she said how my leg didn’t look hurt and how anyone could just say their leg hurts for a free day off. 


She’s almost always telling me to do something while I’m already doing something else and then complaining that I didn’t do the thing she wanted me to do fast enough.

I wear a headset my entire shift because I’m a cashier and take drive thru orders and she’ll tell me something without confirming that I heard her (despite having the ability to talk directly into my headset) and then get mad because I didn’t hear her.

Almost everyone else who’s been working there the same time as me (including someone who started after me) has her number to ask her work stuff except me, meaning I either have to drive all the way up to the store or call the store’s phone and hope she’s there on my days off if I want to know my schedule because there’s no system or anything. 

She’ll yell at me for doing things ‘wrong’ when other managers told me to do them because “what did *I* tell you to do?” Without talking to the manager who told me to do it. 

Yesterday she practically lambasted me because I can’t take orders and cash people out at the same time and instead of showing me how or giving me tips or anything she just keeps making snide comments.

Some examples:

“OP, can’t you multitask? You told me you could in your interview!”

“Oh, I’ll go over there and help Mrs. Can’t Multitask.”

“Are you drinking coffee OP? Maybe that’ll help you multitask.”


I feel like it’s fine if she just doesn’t like me for whatever reason, but her constant negativity is affecting my morale. Luckily there’s a few coworkers who are making things a little better for me, otherwise I would’ve quit by now. I just don’t know what to do about it because it’s really starting to stress me out.

i used to be deep in the 3-cups-a-day cycle. coffee was the first thing i reached for in the morning, and the last thing i’d regret around 2am when i couldn’t fall asleep.

at the time, i just thought it was normal — being wired, anxious, jittery, then crashing. rinse and repeat.

after trying (and failing) to quit at least 5 times, i finally realized i needed something to actually guide me through the process — not just a random article or a caffeine calculator. i wanted something that helped me understand what was going on in my body *while* it was happening.

so i built buzz off with some friends — a simple, judgment-free app that helps you track how you're feeling as you cut back or quit caffeine.

it lets you log things like:

* 😴 sleep
* 😵‍💫 mood
* ☕ cravings
* ⚡ energy

you can track your streaks, see your progress, and start noticing patterns that keep you motivated.

i didn’t want this to feel like another “wellness tracker” — just a tool to help you actually feel better without relying on caffeine to function.

if you're thinking about quitting, or even just cutting back, i get it. it’s not easy. but it’s possible — and you don't have to go through it totally blind.

you can check it out here if you want:

I know it's on Sunday so I'm very late but I honestly just forgot about it. I'd like to crochet him something that he'll like but he's really hard to get gifts for. We've already got him a few things, candy, peanut butter pretzels, a gift card, Father's day card but I want to make him something too. 

He's not really into most of the stereotypical ""dad"" hobbies so Googling ideas hasn't been much help. He's not into any sports, he doesn't drink much, he doesn't cook, doesn't wear hats, doesn't work out, rarely wears ties, doesn't wear slippers, he's not too into: cars, history, the military, guns, hiking, hunting, gardening, reading, traveling, coffee, fishing or camping. 

We also don't need any more cup holders or coasters. 


A few things he does like: cowboy stuff (he has some cowboy boots and hats), sudoku, card games, line dancing, diet coke, board games? (We haven't played any in a while though.), McDonald's, country music, messing with our goofiest cat (he claims he doesn't like animals still 😆), and working on projects around the house (painting, fixing furniture, mowing, vacuuming, fixing cabinets, ect. He has a small work bench in the basement.), and he watches Star Trek (TOS, TNG and Voyager. But he's only a casual fan and doesn't go to any conventions or collection anything).


And his job is at a apartment complex as a sort of repairman, unclogging toilets, fixing pipes, mowing, snow plowing and a lot of painting among other stuff. 


Anyone got any gift ideas for him?

I can't speak very clearly either. When I am with someone, it's much easier to speak. I really enjoy telling people ""nice"" things, like offering to buy a coffee for the barista too, telling someone with cool hair/style that I really like it, etc. I am okay with doing those things, its just really really difficult to physically speak. I am pretty shaky and nervous, so store workers will constantly try talk to me and ask if I need help and it spooks the shit out of me every time (yet I'm okay with complimenting strangers... strange.)

My ""idea"" for how a lanyard or something would work is basically the person sees someone (me) awkwardy mumbling, get a bit irritated that they aren't speaking up, see the ID and go ""ohhhh."" And understanding. Maybe this is too idealized though.

Like, the way I see it, is if there was a child yelling in public and getting annoyed, but then seeing they have tourettes (for example) and immediately understanding they're not purposefully trying to disrupt the peace, they just have a disability.

I needed it for a project.

With this:

* You can manage all your accordion content in a single custom field (as JSON).
* You can use different accordion content for different posts/products—no need to edit the widget every time - great for single product page, or single post page etc.
* Supports HTML in the content (lists, links, bold, etc.).
* You can use this for FAQs, product specs, features, travel iteneraries or anything.. tested with woocommerce products.

How does it work?

* This PHP snippet needs to be installed using any code snippet plugin. (see Pastebin link at the end) this will automatically fill in the titles and content for each item, based on your JSON.
* Add a Accordion widget in Elementor Editor.
* In the Advanced tab of the widget, add a css class like `accordion-json-repeater-faq` (replace `faq` with your custom field key).
* In the content area of each accordion item, add a Text Editor widget with `#accordion-content` as the placeholder. (The title of the accordion item can be anything.. but the content has to be this.) VERBATIM
* Add your JSON to a custom field, with a key of your choice. (see sample json below).
* NOTE:: CREATE ENOUGH ACCORDION ITEMS in editor FOR ALL FUTURE. There is no too much. only the amount of items in the json will show up on the actual site.. rest won't.. so make sure you duplicate the first accordion items multiple times.. 20, 30, 40 whatever you need + some.. just make sure it is more than the number of items in your JSON. each accordion item should have a text editor element with only ""#accordion-content"" written inside.. VERBATIM - without quotes!!

**If you haven't yet enabled the free native wordpress custom fields:**  
If you don’t see the custom fields box, just go to the post or product WP **edit page,** click “Screen Options” in the top right, and check “Custom Fields.” Now you can add your JSON field at the bottom of the page, using a field key of your choice. Just make sure you suffix this key to the css class added to the widget. in this case 'faq'.

Sample Json that shows the versatility of this - contains 10 elements.. so you need minimum 10 items in your accordion for this. :

So I got it again today and asked for it extra sweet. It tastes a tiny bit better but still has that strong coffee flavor, but again could that just be how the macadamia nut syrup tastes? My go-to coffee order is a dreamweaver with almond milk, more hazelnut than white choc. But I haven’t been able to get it recently so I’m trying to branch out on other coffee flavors. I do like the golden eagle too. Anyways if anyone could give me some feedback on if it’s supposed to taste like this I would greatly appreciate it :) 


I totally would ask the broistas at my location, but I always feel like a complicated customer with my coffee orders so I just wanted to get customers and employees opinions on the drink :) ",0,1749855608.0,dutchbros,1,0.5,False

Opted for a swim-up room but not a club room. Anyone know what the well liquors are currently? I've seen that in the past they were like Absolute, beef eater, etc. We are not super picky so I am sure it won't matter, but I'd like to know if anyone does know.

Also, does anyone know what their policy is on having a bottle in your room? Like if we decide to grab something in town, is it ok to have and drink in our room or on our patio, just not bring it out to the more public areas?

Last question, I saw someone talking about their deli and saying that it was just drip coffee. Anyone know if they have espresso, even if it is for an upcharge?

I know I sound high maintenance, but I really am more curious than anything. I can and will survive without anything special, but I do like to know things before hand and their website is lacking on details for sure.",1,1749855597.0,puertovallarta,8,0.67,False

I’m confused","So today I got coffee with my ex after a month of breakup, two weeks of no contact. During our discussion she told me several times she doesn’t see us getting back together and she hopes I’ll treat another woman well. I’m just so confused because why would she agree to meet me for coffee if she has no intention to reconnect? Is she just testing the waters and playing hard to get?",1,1749855559.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
