1qfxl7e,https://i.redd.it/c2fq46qi11eg1.jpeg,Stop dragging Indore’s name for no reason. This is normal athlete thing.,"International athletes carrying their own food, chefs, coffee machines, or water systems is standard practice. This isn’t new. It happens everywhere, not just in Indore.

So jumping to “the team brought a water purifier, therefore Indore is unsafe” is lazy thinking.

Players have personal preferences, medical and dietary routines, and hygiene standards. Someone like Shubman Gill having a specific setup says nothing about the host city. Teams do this for performance consistency, not out of fear.

What’s frustrating is how Indore keeps getting dragged into unrelated narratives. One incident happens and suddenly everything is blamed on the city. These things aren’t connected.

If a player carries their own mattress or coffee grinder tomorrow, will that be Indore’s fault too?

Athlete preference ≠ infrastructure issue

Professional habits ≠ insult to locals

1qfxkgg,https://i.redd.it/kjma161c11eg1.jpeg,Caught the Fever,"Hey everyone! 👋 I’m Franck, a new face here in the group, and I thought I’d share my recent origin story that landed me squarely in the world of espresso obsession.

For years, I’d been a devoted tea drinker, happy with my daily brews and never really tempted by coffee. My wife, on the other hand, has always been a coffee lover and had been dropping hints about wanting a budget-friendly espresso machine. So last October, I surprised her with a Casabrews 5418, a bag of Lavazza Crema e Aroma beans, and decided to pull my very first espresso shot ever… with myself as the official taste-tester guinea pig.

One sip, and bam!… I was hooked. The rich crema, the bold flavor, the whole ritual… it hit me like a caffeine fever dream. I instantly fell head over heels for everything espresso, ultimately landing on Americans as my go to.

Fast forward, and I’ve since passed the trusty Casabrews along to my daughter (who’s putting it to good use), upgraded to a full-on proper home coffee bar setup, and haven’t looked back since (see photo). 

What started as a sweet gesture for my wife turned into my new passion project.

Excited to be here, learn from all of you pros, and share more about my journey! 

What’s your “how I got into espresso” story? 😄☕",2,1768706779.0,CoffeePorn,0,1.0,False

I (29F) married my husband, Brian, (47M) 3 years ago. We met at a very early morning class at the gym. At the time we met he was married with 2 kids. For 3 months we worked out together, got to know each other and started having coffee after the gym. He would frequently complain about his (49F) wife, Jessica; she was fat, unmotivated, lazy, bad in bed, disengaged from the marriage, not ambitious at work, etc. He explained that he felt defeated, unloved and unappreciated for all he did. He was highly complementary of me, on the other hand, and praised all of my accomplishments. 

4 months into our hanging out, talking on the phone, texting, etc, Brian left his wife and kids. I was excited as I had fallen for him and he for me. Within weeks of leaving he filed for divorce. His wife, Jessica, did not contest anything. He gave her full custody, generous alimony and child support in addition to letting her stay in the house with the kids. 

During the divorce, Brian and I travelled, fine dined, and lived it up! All of things he said he couldn't do with his wife. He had a high paying job and loved to treat me, even though I also had a high paying job. Life was amazing and we married a couple of months after his divorce was final. 

Things took a turn a year after our wedding. Brian lost his high-paying job and couldn't find another one. He now works for my family for basically minimum wage. Then I found out that all our travel and high living was actually paid for from Brian's HELOC on the home he owned with his wife, and several credit cards he maxed out. Now we have a mountain of debt in excess of $200,000. I had to rent out the house I owned because I could no longer afford the mortgage and satisfy the debt obligation. We were forced to rent a rundown apartment from my parents. 

If things weren’t bad enough, Brian came home and told me that his ex-wife is now suing him for back child support and alimony. She has secured a wage garnishment. I am at a total loss. He owes her over $80,000. I had no idea he had not been paying her.  At this point I don’t know what to do. I am supporting him completely. My life is unrecognizable to what it was just 4 years ago.

But I need to vent and see if I'm the asshole here. Buckle up, because this story is wild.

So, background: Me (28M) and my buddy Jake (27M) have been friends since high school. We're like brothers—shared everything from beers to bad decisions. But Jake has this habit of being a total prankster douchebag. Harmless stuff at first, like swapping my shampoo with Nair or putting itching powder in my gym shorts. I'd laugh it off, get him back with something light, and we'd move on.

But last month, he crossed the line. Big time. I had this huge job interview for my dream position at a tech firm—six figures, remote work, the works. I'd been prepping for weeks, even bought a new suit. The night before, Jake crashes at my place after a ""quick drink"" turns into a bender. I wake up feeling like death, but I power through.

Turns out, while I was passed out, Jake thought it'd be hilarious to spike my coffee with laxatives. Not just any laxatives—industrial-strength stuff he got from who knows where. Mid-interview (over Zoom, thank god), my stomach erupts like Mount Vesuvius. I'm sweating, clenching, trying to answer questions about algorithms while fighting for my life. I excuse myself, but it's too late—the damage is done. I bomb the interview, they ghost me, and now I'm stuck in my dead-end retail job for another year.

I was furious. Called him out, and he just laughed it off like ""bro, it's just a prank!"" No apology, no nothing. That was the last straw. I stewed on it for days, plotting my revenge. I needed something epic, something that'd make him regret ever messing with me.

Enter: Operation Dog Butt Glue.

Jake has this massive golden retriever named Max—sweet dog, loves everyone, including Jake's face (he lets the dog lick him constantly, it's gross). Jake's always bragging about how Max is his ""best boy."" So, one weekend when Jake invites me over to ""make amends"" with pizza and games, I show up prepared. In my pocket: a tube of industrial super glue. The kind that bonds in seconds and needs acetone to remove.

We chill, play some Fortnite, and I wait for my moment. Jake gets up to grab beers, and I ""accidentally"" spill some chips on the floor. Max, being a vacuum cleaner on legs, dives in. Jake laughs and bends down to pet him, getting all up in Max's face like usual.

That's when I strike. Quick as a flash, I squirt a line of glue on Max's butt fur (don't worry, it was a tiny amount, nothing that'd hurt the dog—just enough for adhesion). Jake leans in to ""kiss"" Max's head or whatever weird shit he does, but I ""trip"" and bump him forward. Boom—his lips make contact with Max's rear end. The glue sets instantly.

Chaos ensues. Jake freaks out, muffled screams because his mouth is sealed shut to dog ass. Max is wagging his tail like it's playtime, dragging Jake around the living room on his knees. I'm dying laughing, filming the whole thing on my phone (blurred out for privacy, obvs). Jake's eyes are bulging, he's flailing, and Max just thinks it's a new game.

After a solid 5 minutes of this hilarious hell, I help him out. Grabbed some nail polish remover from his bathroom (acetone-based), soaked a cloth, and carefully dissolved the glue. No permanent damage—Jake's lips were red and sore, Max's fur needed a trim, but everyone was fine. Jake was pissed, called me every name in the book, but I just said, ""Bro, it's just a prank!""

We haven't talked since. He blocked me everywhere, and mutual friends are split—some say I went too far, others think he had it coming. AITA? Was this justified revenge, or did I cross into psycho territory?

TL;DR: Friend ruins my job interview with laxatives, so I super glued his mouth to his dog's butt as payback. Now he's mad, AITA?",3,1768706293.0,story,1,1.0,False

This place hired me almost immediately, which in hindsight should have scared me.

I’ve worked retail since I was 14 at two different stores, so I thought I could handle it. Turns out food service is a whole different nightmare. Faster, louder, more chaotic. I took the job anyway because the pay is way better.
I fucking hate it.

The coworkers are somehow a full collection of the worst people you can be stuck with at a job. Usually there’s one or two awful ones and everyone else is fine. Here it’s the entire staff.
One of the managers is a straight up creep. He hits on every attractive girl that comes in and has made comments about how young some of them look. What really pushed me over the edge was the dress code stuff. We have to wear black pants, fine. I bought two pairs. One tight pair and one nicer, looser pair of server pants. The amount of shit I got for wearing the looser ones was insane. He kept repeating that pants on girls should be tight. Yeah.

There’s also one coworker who is just genuinely nasty. Not mildly rude, not having a bad day. Customers have literally thrown hot coffee at her kind of nasty. The rest of the staff barely acknowledges me. I try to help or talk to them and just get stared at until I walk away.

I used to judge people who job hopped. I thought it meant you had bad work ethic, particularly because the two jobs Ive worked over the course of 8 years had good work environments. Three weeks into this place and I fully get it now. Some workplaces are just awful and no amount of “pushing through” fixes that.

The only reason I’m still here is because I can’t afford not to be. I can’t go even a week without a paycheck right now, and January hiring is brutal. The plan is to survive the semester and get out by summer if I can.

Anyway this is my official apology to job hoppers. I did not realize jobs could be this shitty.",2,1768705611.0,hatemyjob,1,1.0,False

I've been going to 13 Coins since 1979 when I was 15: I was working at the Fun Forest at the Seattle Center as a Ride Operator & the 13 Coins on Boren was the place to hang out PLUS back then, they were open 24/7.

Even though I no longer live in King County, (but I work for King County), I still visit the 13 Coins, the last time prior to this morning was when the Titanic exhibit was at the waterfront.

My friend & I had planned to have breakfast at Ludi's but they were closed (sign on the door said that they were on vacation) so I googled to see what was opening soon. 13 Coins. 

Drove down, got a primo parking spot right in front (heck, it's 6:59am on a Saturday), and went in. Ordered what I did. Asked for a to-go box & checks. Almost $40.00 (with tip) for two eggs, bacon, hash browns, & two pieces of lethargic looking rye toast: seemed a bit much but the food was good. There was no option for a printed receipt so hey, just email it to me. 

Got home, checked my email, & what the mugglefuck is this 4% SERVICE CHARGE for? We all know that it didn't go to the server.

So, after all of these years of going to the 13 Coins, I have added them to my list of Seattle restaurants to avoid because of crap service charges or fees. Hell, at least say what I'm being charged for. 

And I know that my feeble attempt to hide the server's name failed but I am making homemade hom bows & my oven is beeping. And nobody wants burnt hom bows. ",10,1768705583.0,SeattleWA,1,0.75,False

We went on a date like maybe two weeks ago and it was honestly great. I thought It would be pretty awkward (because I'm just an awkward person in general) but no, she made me really comfortable. I paid, drove her home, and yeah that was the end of it.

After that, we have been texting pretty consistently. We talk about some basic things like work, hobbies, just random stuff. The conversations we have are really nice, and it seems like we're getting really comfortable with each other.

This is where I'm unsure.

Since we have gotten more comfortable with each other she's mentioned how she has been ""destroying the toilet"" pretty often. I really didn't think much of it, only that her sense of humor is kind of weird but hey, so is mine. Score.

I was speaking to her about her job since she mentioned she's a barista. I put my phone down to take out my dog. When I came back, I noticed she had unsent two messages. I asked her what she unsent, and she replied, “A failed attempt at a joke.” I playfully pester her into telling me, and then she finally gives in.

>Sometimes I poop in the customers coffee.

Well...alright, talking about feces once again. Whatever, I brush it off and send some laughing emojis. Our conversation returns back to normal and this time we are speaking about a completely different topic.

She's a nice woman, and I'm really into her. I'm noticing that these poop ""jokes"" are reoccurring a pretty decent amount of the time.

Maybe she's trying to send me subliminal messages or something? Or she's testing the waters to see if I'm into scat?

He works in finance and is a bit of a numbers guy, but he’s always been generous. We split rent 50/50, but he usually insists on paying for dinners and vacations because he earns significantly more than I do.

Yesterday, Mark asked me to send a PDF from his laptop while he was at the gym. When I opened the file explorer, I saw a folder titled ""Long Term Investments."" Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened it. Inside was an Excel sheet with my name on it.

It’s a line-by-line breakdown of **everything**.

* The coffee he bought on our first date ($6.45).
* Every birthday gift, anniversary dinner, and bouquet of flowers.
* Even ""estimated"" costs for gas when he drives us to my parents' house.

At the bottom of the sheet, there is a grand total (it’s over $20,000) and a column labeled ""Reimbursement Value."" There are notes next to certain items like ""offset by her paying for groceries in Oct"" or ""to be discussed post-marriage.""

He never mentioned any of this. I thought these were gifts and acts of love. Now I feel like I’ve been a line item in a ledger for four years. When he got home, I tried to bring up the ""cost of living"" generally to see if he'd admit it, and he just acted completely normal, even saying ""don't worry about the money, babe, I've got you.""

ls this some ""finance person"" quirk? I’m supposed to marry this man in eight weeks, but now I feel like I’m just a debt he’s tracking.

It didn't feel like enough distance from my aunt and my thoughts were already collapsing on themselves the longer I stayed here. I needed air. After a moment, I forced myself up from the bed and went to grab my car keys and purse off the nightstand. They were missing. My aunt must have grabbed it while I was asleep this morning. I didn't want to entertain the thought that maybe she was ordered to take them.

 I searched the room for any sign of surveillance with the hope that I was overreacting. I didn't find anything. I took a slow breath through my nose, like I could convince my body that nothing had changed. I was mid-thought when I heard a buzzing sound and immediately reached for my phone only to find no notification. It took me a second to realize the buzz sound I heard was in fact the doorbell. 

Confused, I crossed the room and pulled the curtain back to look outside. He was standing on the front steps of the house, hands shoved into the pockets of his hoodie looking like he wasn't sure he should be here. I recognized him immediately as the boy who lived next door although I hadn't talked to him in years. Growing up, sometimes I'd interact with him just to stay sane. For a split second, I considered opening the window and calling out. Not because I thought he could help me but because I needed an excuse to get out of my aunt's grasp for a while. 

I lost the chance. I could already hear my aunt's calm voice downstairs in mid conversation with him. By the time I reached the stairs, she was already closing the front door. From where I stood I watched him walk away, pausing once to look back before getting into his car. He didn't come back.

Only then did my aunt turn to face me as she spoke. “He recognized your car in the driveway. I didn't account for that.” 

I wanted to say something but the words caught in my throat. She did what she does best. She contained the problem. 

“You moved my things. My keys.” I said quietly. 

“I did. Make no mistake, you aren't a prisoner here Cecilia. But you are to remain indoors for the time being.” She responded, knowing I wouldn't argue. 

My phone buzzed and I checked the notification as another email log stared back at me. 

*Subject remains stationary. Environmental variables noted*. 

I backed away from her as my chest tightened. My pulse jumped. Fleeing wasn't an option. It never was. My aunt simply smiled at me like she was the same woman she had always been. The same woman who taught me fractions in the kitchen and combed my hair in the morning. She politely excused herself and walked to the kitchen, mumbling something about making tea and routines. 

After she left I tiptoed toward the front door, testing the gap between the frame and the carpet. If I could step outside for just a moment, maybe I'd feel better. 

Another ping cut through the silence. This time it came from the laptop that was set on the coffee table. The screen blinked. 

*Subject movement detected. Threat response noted.* 

I froze and with trembling hands, I stepped away from the door. My steps no longer felt like my own. My thoughts and actions never belonged to me to begin with. I sank back against the wall as I thought back to what my aunt had said about the burden of choice. Did she truly believe this was mercy? Freeing me from a life where I'm burdened by choice?

Another ping.

*Subject displays heightened anxiety. Further monitoring required.* 

I couldn't think without my thoughts being analyzed. I couldn't act without it being recorded. 

Without thinking, I took small steps toward the laptop to shut it. I just wanted some peace of mind without hearing it ping each time I did something. I wanted some sense of control. 

As my fingers hovered over the power off button, the screen blinked.

*Subject attempts unauthorized interaction. Response pending.*

1qfwxag,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qfwxag/capricorn/,Capricorn,"I had a dream about you this morning, right as I was about to wake up.

I’ve been deliberating for several days If I should text you happy birthday, since our birthdays are only a couple days apart. It feels unnatural for me not to consider you, not get you a gift. I always thought it was sweet how our birthdays were in such close proximity. And it always struck me as so thoughtful and kind that you came by my house last year to personally deliver me presents after I was sick. I know you can be that person.

In my dream you, the girl you hate, and your band member who I’m also at war with knocked on the door.

You told me that you had gifts for me, and wanted to wish me a happy birthday. You asked to come in, like vampires. I was confused as to why you would do such a thing, because you know I’m on bad terms with two out of the three of you. But I let you in anyway, because my heart has always always been soft. Because I’ve always looked for the kindest parts of people. It’s in my nature. That’s what kept our friendship alive for years after how you acted, over and over again. you told me that you and your band member wanted to put what happened aside and move forward. The girl you hate watched on. I told you and your band member that I was sorry how things went down like they did, and it pains me so much that we are on bad terms. We exchanged gifts and enjoyed each other’s company for the first time in almost 6 months.

I wish it could be like this in the waking world. I wish you and your band member had the emotional regulation to sit with discomfort instead of firing off your angst on the people who care about you the most. It’s hard not to compare and contrast that with the time in real life when I bumped into you at a coffee shop. How you walked right up to me and our mutual friend yet said nothing to me and didn’t even glance in my direction. Why couldn’t you just wait in line to get a coffee or go to the bathroom until I left? I know you did it deliberately to make me feel something, maybe even intimidate me. Why couldn’t you make me feel something good like you did in the dream?

1qfwnxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1qfwnxu/aita_for_wanting_my_best_friend_to_breakup_with/,AITA for wanting my best friend to breakup with his girlfriend?,"My friend “Jacob” (22M) has just recently hit his one year mark with his girlfriend, “Layla” (22F). 

At first I had nothing but unconditional support for my best friend, and was happy to see him happy. Over the course of the next 5 months my friend Jacob barely responds to anybody, I had no idea what was going on his personal life at this point,  but I excused it as just a honeymoon phase, after all, we’re young. Come June, Jacob finally reaches out and asks to hangout, and unknowingly I got a chance to meet her, and even more importantly, I got to know her (both personality wise and her past).

The first thing that struck me was her obscenity in the things she says. Even though we had just met, she was very vocal to both me and another friend who is closest to Jacob, saying things along the lines of, “You guys get bitches? That’s surprising” and, “Jacob isn’t exactly my type based on my history but the more I got to know him the more I found him cute”. While not an atrocity, I just find it strange. Layla is a very outspoken person, and seems to lack any form of social boundaries. She uses homophobic slurs, but it’s okay because she identifies as bisexual, will no exaggeration CONSTANTLY interrupt mid conversation to complain about extremely irrelevant things, blasts volume at maximum capacity on her iPad while we’re watching a movie or show, and constantly belittles other people including myself but plays it off as if she’s joking. She is always complaining about something, and because of this weird power scheme she has over Jacob, he is always forced to say “I’m sorry honey”. She has no water near her? I’m sorry honey. She forgot to start the laundry? I’m sorry honey. She didn’t buy the right cheese for a recipe? I’m sorry honey. ITS NEVER ENDING. Adding to this, they met last September, and since June have been saying I love you, and have brought up marriage. You’ve known this person for less than a year at this point, how is marriage even a feasible thought to you?

She is a high school graduate, and has never worked anywhere besides fast food. Matter of fact, she’s been fired more than she’s quit. I don’t know how he looks past that, but to each their own. Layla more recently got a job at a coffee place, and has taken akin to it, but even then was worried about being fired 2 weeks ago. If asked why, she just gave some generic answer. On top of the job stuff and no further education, she’s never owned a car in her life, and makes Jacob drive her literally everywhere. I was baffled by this. 22 years old, and no form of transportation? I tried to be sympathetic, as she comes from a relatively poor family. Then we did some talking and I realized that she has terrible money spending habits. Doesn’t matter if it’s $10 or $100, she will get it when she’s able. She even admitted that prior to this coffee job, she had never seen a paycheck above $1000. At 22 years old. I could go into more depth but am held back by character limits.

It started last night when my mother had a little too much wine and kept myself and herself up later than either of us should have been; I went to bed before her for once and she didn't get out of bed until 4 p.m. today. I woke up late but I thought for sure I'd get to write at my usual time. Then I had to help Father learn how to use the new washer and dryer. Stupid thing works like a computer. I am not fond of it. Why do I have to change the settings on the thing as if it were a phone in order to access the pin only function? Why the fuck does it have an AI mode? Why the fuck does the AI mode take precedence over the spin only function, so much so that is is the second mode available on the machine while I had to manual make spin only available to me? Ridiculous thing. AI mode was the first thing I disabled and I am not hooking the worthless thing up to my wifi, why the fuck would I want that? It is like T.V. companies started tacking 3.D. mode onto all their products and hopefully the fad dies out just as quickly.

By the time all that was figured out it was almost 4 p.m. I was hopeful I'd get to write at least a little tonight but those hopes are slowly dying because now I am helping set up the new clothes line in the laundry room. It is going well enough aside from the fact that I the damn thing is peeling from the wall under a single towels weight. I swear, the walls in this house are as flimsy as paper. I made have to glue it or something just to keep it stable. 

I am exhausted. I want to write but I also want to cease to exist for a few hours and sadly, you can't do both things at once. How annoying. I do not want to be taking days off when I am this close to being done. I especially don't want to be taking days off without actually getting to relax and feel like it was a 'day off.'

Well, at least I have gotten a lot more than usual done the last few days. Hopefully that makes up for todays lacklustre performance. I am going to make myself a coffee. Hell know's I need it after today. A doughnut could also do me well. Wish me luck in having the energy to get at least a sentence written. Something is always better than nothing.

If you’re in a reading mood and can’t find a good book, I’ve written one for you. Sadly, this is a very true story from this week.

You may have read my other post about not being reimbursed for mileage. If you wanted an update about that, my NPs did agree to pay it, though they don’t feel they should have to. The rest of the meeting, however, didn’t quite make up for that.

I have been in childcare for over 20 years, and I’m confident enough in my experience to say this: I am excellent at my job. I have the education, patience, joy, dedication, and love this work requires. I show up fully every day.

My current NK is 17 months old, has over 60 words, and has already met many 24-month milestones. She is well-regulated, well-adjusted, full of joy & empathy, and is securely attached. I absolutely adore my time with her.

And yet, I’m struggling to love this profession anymore.

This is my third family in a row (each over a year long) where the job is falling apart, not because of the children, but because of parental disrespect and control.

This week, I had a contract renewal meeting with my NPs for year two. A second baby is due soon, so the job is changing significantly. We are still at an impasse over several issues.

# Chapter One: Breaks

Because this job doesn’t guarantee breaks, I use discretion to take brief mental resets during independent play. This may look like texting my adult daughter for 5–10 minutes while remaining attentive to my NK. I’m otherwise rarely on my phone, but this job is isolating, and these moments help me regulate and stay present during long days (often 11 hours).

MB said this was absolutely not allowed. If NK is awake, I’m expected to be “fully engaged” at all times.

I’ve been with this family for a year and have proven myself to be an attentive, engaged caregiver. I am not a teenager. I’m a grown woman with three grown children of my own. Their child is happy, secure, developmentally thriving, and strongly attached to me because of all the one-on-one engagement.

More importantly, independent play is developmentally appropriate for toddlers, and brief periods of rest are essential for caregiver sustainability, especially in jobs with no guaranteed child-free time.

The day after this meeting, my NPs repositioned all five cameras in the house to eliminate blind spots. Given how often we’re out at classes, the library, and activities, this didn’t feel about safety. It felt like control and surveillance. My phone usage is definitely being clocked, and I get passive aggressive feedback reminding me to “rinse potatoes before peeling them.” Meal prep is done during NKs naps and my break time, so knowing even then I’m being monitored is taking a huge toll on my nervous system. After a year of trust being built, surveillance should be lessening, not tightening.

# Chapter Two: Contract Refusal

Last year, I made a mistake by accepting their extremely minimal contract instead of mine. I have never done this with any other family, and the entire year I felt the effects of it. This year, with a second child coming, I asked them to at least review my standard nanny agreement.

They refused to agree to it outright. They told me that this is “not a professional position” and “an over-detailed contract like this isn't needed. It feels overkill on protection, and the document we sent should be more than fine. The rest of the details we can decide as they come up. If we trust each other, then we should act like it.""

I responded with, ""The overprotection you're referring to is my protection. And if you'e so focused on trust and what this document is meant to represent, the fact that you're so worried about agreeing to it tells me a lot. What I sent you is a very standard nanny-employee agreement. Your document only offers protection moving in one direction, and the person who has everything to lose in that agreement is me.“

I asked which parts of the contract raised red flags for them. They told me they did not want to have a policy on snow days (their preference is to figure that out as it comes up), maternity leave expectations (wild since I only put the expectations NPs had for after this new baby is born), and they won’t agree to my breaks section discussed above.

That’s when MB accused me of trying to manipulate them by “sneaking benefits” into the contract and hoping they wouldn’t notice. I was truly confused here.

For reference, I provide sick care so that my NPs do not have to miss time at work. We agreed last year that if I miss time for an illness contracted from my NK, it would not come out of my sick time or PTO, up to five days.

MB claimed I was trying to make illness contracted from their children “unlimited” in my contract because I didn’t specify the 5-day cap in that section. I clarified immediately that I’ve always operated under a cap, I agreed to it last year, and agree to it again this year. If the number wasn’t explicitly written, it was an oversight, not a scheme. She kept insisting that I was trying to deceive them.

I asked her, “How would I even enforce this?” Besides, they track my sick days on a spreadsheet, and I haven’t even used half of mine this year. She didn’t have much to say except, “As long as you weren’t trying to deceive us, but I still feel uncomfortable.” After a full year of honest, professional work, where I don’t even feel comfortable using their coffee and bring my own coffee and milk to make while I am at work.

# Chapter Three: Task Expectations

They expect me to wash bottles used when I’m off the clock, clean weekend messes, and absorb ongoing household tasks justified by “other nannies do it.”

More specifically, and I thought this was an important detail to remember: DB started to justify this and said, ""We have nanny friends--""

MB interrupted, ""No. We have friends with nannies. We don't have nanny friends.""

Wow. Ok.

DB continued, ""And their nannies wash bottles and clean messes from the weekend or from before they got there."" I said that I can't speak for other nannies and what their agreements are. But if they do all of that, it doesn't make it right and certainly doesn't make it a rule. Nannies are also often exploited and taken advantage of, and some don't have enough experience to advocate for themselves. Unfortunately this industry isn't regulated, and it is one of the hardest things about the job. We have no HR, we have no union. We have only ourselves, and with every new family, we have to advocate again and again. On that same note, there are clearly outlined standards that good employers will educate themselves on, and one of the top and most well-known standards is that nannies are only responsible for child-related messes, dishes, and bottles that happen on her watch.

DB interrupted and said, “By that logic, it seems like you’re saying nannies shouldn’t be responsible for clothes that get dirty when they’re not here, so we need two hampers? One for your laundry and one for ours?” I said, “Possibly, because some families don't include laundry as a nanny's task at all. Some don't have any tasks expected except to focus on the care of the child. But if the children’s laundry is part of an agreement, then yes, all of NKs laundry is a nanny's responsibility.” DB then pushed harder and said, ""Well, what else won't you clean? Like these blocks? We’re supposed to clean them up every night if she plays with them before bed?"" I said, ""Setting the nanny's stage so that she can come in and have autonomy over her day - so she can focus her energy on the children while also knowing what her defined roles are for the day outside of childcare is important. Just as I set the stage for you on Friday before I leave (and every other night) to set you up for a successful evening and weekend with your family, the same collaboration should move the other direction as well.""

They disagree fully and that boundary was repeatedly pushed.

On top of all this, their contract lists an extensive scope that goes far beyond core nanny duties. Meal planning, weekly prep for the family, deep cleaning children’s equipment, toy sanitation rotations, household resets for weekends, fridge and freezer management, and more. All while caring for a newborn and toddler.

I’ve repeatedly asked to scale back to core nanny responsibilities and rebuild later when it’s more sustainable. As someone who has spent years caring for multiple children, I’d hope they would defer to me to know what’s possible in a day. I’m not asking for less work. They know I hardly sit still and work very hard. A newborn will also make sure I’m plenty busy.

I’m asking for more time to focus on childcare. Isn’t that why I’m there??

**Chapter Four:** **Maternity Leave Expectations**

MB will be home for six months. I asked whether responsibility might be shared at times, specifically with the idea to allow her time to rest, time to bond with the newborn, and moments of quality time with her older child while I care for the baby.

I was told I should expect full responsibility for both children at all times. I didn’t really think anything of that until she said, “But since you keep fixating on breaks—I’ll be home, so if you need me to take the baby for five minutes, just ask.”

Five minutes. Her newborn.

# Epilogue: Where This Leaves Me

If you’ve made it this far, thank you.

After 20 years, I may be walking away from a career I poured myself into the same way I did with my own children. These environments feel fundamentally different than they used to, and it’s slowly breaking me.

I will not allow my body, my health, my nervous system, or my longevity to be treated as expendable inside someone else’s system.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Maybe it’s just your genes.","If you’ve spent years trying to ""calm down"" your anxiety, it might not be a character flaw. It might be a metabolic bottleneck worsened by caffeine. 

​I found out I’m a slow caffeine metabolizer with the COMT met/met genotype. I got gene testing after a few clues that I might comt met/met to have it confirmed while also finding out caffeine is bad for MY anxiety and MY cardiovascular disease risk (in ppl who have a slow enzyme to break it down).

Here is why that combination makes caffeine a nightmare for ppl like me (and maybe you).

​**The Double Whammy**

​Most people’s bodies are built to process and dump stimulants. If you have these specific genes, your ""cleanup crew"" is very slow.

​CYP1A2 (The Slow Burn): This gene dictates how fast your liver clears caffeine. If you’re a ""slow metabolizer,"" caffeine stays in your system for an eternity. That 8 AM latte is still screaming in your bloodstream at 10 PM.

​COMT Met/Met (The ""Worry Gene""): COMT is the enzyme that clears stress hormones like adrenaline and dopamine. The Met/Met variant is roughly 3–4x slower at this job than average.

​Why this creates a ""Panic Loop""

​When you drink caffeine, you force your body to dump adrenaline.

​Your CYP1A2 keeps the caffeine active, so the ""adrenaline tap"" stays open.

​Your COMT is too slow to mop up the mess.

​The result? You aren't just ""energized."" You are trapped in a biological state of fight and flight that your body literally cannot switch off. While your friends are ""crushing it,"" you’re just trying to remember how to breathe.

​It’s not in your head. It’s in your DNA.

​Many treat caffeine like water. But for some of us, caffeine isn't a performance enhance, it’s a chemical trigger for a nervous system breakdown.

​If you struggle with:

​Heart palpitations hours after coffee

​Intrusive thoughts/overthinking

​""Wired but tired"" insomnia

​Anxiety that feels ""physical"" rather than situational

​Try quitting. Not because of willpower, but because your genetics deserve a break. You might find that the ""anxious person"" you thought you were was just a person whose liver and brain were overworked.

​What to do next:

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the kicker: **You might already have enough—you’re just not seeing it the right way.**

Most of us fixate on the *number* in our savings, but real financial freedom isn’t about how much you *have*—it’s about how much your money can *do* for you. A $50K nest egg could fund years of travel, a side hustle, or even early retirement… if you play it smart.

### **The Money Illusion We All Fall For**
- **Myth:** *""I need a million dollars to retire.""*
  **Reality:** The average person could retire *decades* earlier if they optimized their savings. (Yes, even on a ""normal"" salary.)
- **Myth:** *""Investing is only for the rich.""*
  **Reality:** Compound interest doesn’t care if you start with $100 or $10K—it just cares that you *start*.
- **Myth:** *""I’ll figure it out later.""*
  **Reality:** Later = more stress, fewer options. (Ask anyone who waited until 50 to check their 401(k).)

### **How to Turn ""Not Enough"" Into ""More Than Enough""**
1. **The 4% Rule (Your Secret Weapon)**
   - If you have $500K saved, you could safely withdraw **$20K/year** *without ever touching the principal*. (That’s $1,666/month—tax-free if it’s in a Roth IRA.)
   - *Not there yet?* Even $100K could give you **$4K/year** in passive income. That’s a free vacation. Or a car payment. Or *peace of mind*.

2. **The ""Latent Riches"" in Your Daily Life**
   - That $15/day coffee habit? **$5,475/year**—enough to max out an IRA.
   - The subscription you forgot to cancel? **$240/year**—that’s a free flight if you invest it.
   - *Small leaks sink big ships.* Plug them, and suddenly your ""not enough"" becomes ""plenty.""

3. **The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
   - Stop asking: *""How much do I have?""*
   - Start asking: *""How much can this *do* for me?""*
   - Example: A friend of mine had $80K saved at 35. She thought it was ""nothing."" Then she ran the numbers—**it could fund a $3,200/year side income forever.** Now? She’s building a tiny home in Costa Rica. *On $80K.*

### **The One Thing Holding You Back (It’s Not What You Think)**
It’s not the economy. It’s not your salary. It’s **the story you tell yourself** about what’s possible.

*You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.* [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(Affiliate link—if you sign up, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you!)*

A few days later I noticed he wasn’t eating as much, still eating but just leaving maybe a table spoon or 2 leftover. We went back to the vet, did blood work and all it showed was inflammation, so they thought it was just a tummy ache (no bathroom problems though) and he got an anti inflammatory shot and seems better again. Then about a week later (dec 29th) he didn’t eat anything. Got an emergency appointment for the next morning, had X-rays, and he was going to stay overnight for observation with an IV. But the vet called me in the afternoon and said George ate 2 cans of food immediately, X-rays didn’t show anything, and he was confident George was ok and he was able to come home the same day. I noticed that night his cough started again and this time he was sneezing too. Now it was New Year’s Eve and he was sneezing a lot, pawing at his face, and I noticed one eye pupil was ever so slightly larger than the other. I called so many vets because most were closed or closing early for the holiday and was able to get another emergency appointment at a different (and much better) vet clinic about and hour away. They did an examination but without knowing what the other vet gave him they didn’t want to over do any meds. He seemed somewhat ok, heart and lungs were good and he wasn’t walking weird or displaying any concerning things like that but made an appointment for the 2nd for when they could see his records. New Year’s Day and night were really scary, he was constantly coughing and sneezing and looked very uncomfortable. On the 2nd they did an ultrasound of his organs, everything looked excellent, so another round of antibiotics and an anti inflammatory and he was right back to normal old George. But the following Wednesday (7th) his appetite started to decrease again, he was becoming a bit lethargic, and he wasn’t purring as much which he always did as soon as I touched him. Made an appointment and went back to the new vet Friday and they noticed one lymph node in his neck was slightly swollen. The vet did an ultrasound and wasn’t comfortable at that point getting a sample without sedation because of where it is and how small it was so we made another appointment for next Friday and if it was still swollen he’ll take a sample (I wasn’t going to feed George that morning for sedation). But that weekend the coughing started again and I could hear this congested gargley sound, he was struggling to breathe through his nose. Back at the vet first thing Monday at the same clinic but different vet because the other person was off. Now the lymph node was bigger, they took an X-ray and confirmed this airway wasn’t obstructed, and took a sample of the lymph node but everyone in the office looked at it and couldn’t see anything unusual, so sent it to the lab and results would come back that Friday. They give him another round of antibiotics and drops for his nose. He barely ate anything that Monday, didn’t eat anything at all Tuesday, and now he had thick snot bubbling out of his nostrils so that night I drove 3 hours to the emergency vet/vet specialist center in the city where he stayed overnight. In that examination his other lymph node was now starting to swell. In the morning the specialist did some tests, double checked with the oncologist… it was lymphoma and it was incredibly agressive, chemo was not going to extend his life nor would anything else. There was literally nothing anyone could do but try to make him comfortable. He didn’t eat while there but at least he got fluids. When talking to the dr I asked how long do I have and they didn’t know but if he didn’t eat I should say goodbye Friday… he didn’t eat when we got home even with the big meds, Thursday morning I could tell he was extremely uncomfortable and still not eating. I recognized that at that point I was only keeping him alive for my own benefit not his. At least I had gotten one more night holding my teddy bear George. I called a bunch of travel vets and found one that would come later that afternoon to help him cross over.

We went outside to his favorite spots, he purred a little, and got to feel what little patch of grass in the snow there was on his little beans, then we spent the rest of the morning/early afternoon cuddling on my bed. It was the most comfortable I’ve seen him in the last few days, he even purred a little more. The vet was very sweet, she gave him the relaxer while he was still on my bed, he got up and moved to one of his favorite spots by the wood stove before it started to take effect. I held him as they started to kick in then placed him in his heated bed on the couch (another favorite of his). I kept telling him that I love so much, that I did everything I could, that’s he’s going to be ok and it’s gonna be all better soon, all while kissing his sweet precious face and little paws. The dr gave him the last injection while I held him in his bed and I just kept saying I love you George, I love you my little bean bean. I held him for a good 30min afterward, still kissing his face and telling him how much I love him…

It all happened so fast, all within a month he went from 100% to crossing the bridge. It really seemed like he was going to get better than those last several days were just such a quick decline. I did everything I could, even the vet specialist said I did more then most people, I did everything right, and it would have been impossible for it to be found sooner or to have prevented it. It’s was just an extremely aggressive lymphoma that started somewhere in his nasal cavity. I’m comforted by the fact that I know I did everything possible to help him and knowing that I was ready to do anything to help him. My dog Juno passed away in October 2022, George absolutely adored Juno and knowing that they are reunited brings me comfort too. He knew I loved him, that he was the center of the universe, and that I would do and did do everything I could for him his whole life. He had an amazing, full, loving, and happy life. He would always sleep on his back, fully stretched out with his belly exposed and I would kiss his tummy and he would purr; he was always so happy and comfortable.

It feels so weird now, I’m struggling to grasp what happened, it was just so fast and this doesn’t seem real. He was always an independent kitty, so not seeing or hearing him for a few hours at a time seems normal. Sometimes I feel guilty like I’m not grieving hard enough like when my Juno passed (very traumatic circumstances) because I won’t be crying in that moment and everything feels normal. I feel even more guilty because in those moments I looked at some local shelter websites and think about getting another cat because I’m all alone now (I need more time before that and it feels disrespectful too get another so soon even though I know no one will ever replace my George). But then I go into my bedroom and he’s not under the blankets, he’s not sleeping in his bed next to the wood stove, he’s not in the window looking outside, he’s not there with me at night under the covers like a teddy bear… he’s gone forever, and I weep uncontrollably

I’m sorry for the long post, I just can’t believe this is real. I love my George so much 🐈‍⬛

**The Mantle**  
  
To say I was stunned by Captain Marcus's statement would be an understatement. I sat there staring at the man, wondering if it was true. I reflected on what had happened to me, everything from the time I was a child. I'd never considered myself special, and yet extraordinary things seemed to happen to me.  
  
Captain Marcus cleared his throat, which brought me back to the present.  
  
He continued, ""I know this is a lot, but the Church has been looking for you. Look at your halberd. Where did you even get it? The original halberd was lost years ago when the founder of the Militant Branch of the Church of Peace passed.""  
  
Nyla responded, ""It was in my father's armory. No one knew where it came from, or how it got there. It was much too large for any Cat-kin to wield, so Father gave it to Paul.""  
  
""That makes perfect sense,"" Marcus said, nodding. ""It is reported that Valen had tried to return the halberd to Sanctuary. The founders of the Church of Peace, who were still working out of Sanctuary at the time, never saw him return. He must have passed away in the lands of Prydia Solaris, and someone recovered the weapon.""  
  
Captain Marcus looked directly at me. ""Paul, the similarities between you and Valen are remarkable. He was an escaped slave. He bore a brand, though not a magical one. A mark from his time as a slave in the mines. He escaped and was found by the founders of the Church of Peace. They nursed him back to health in Sanctuary.""  
  
Marcus leaned forward, his voice intense. ""The slavers were looking for victims when they caught some Dog-kin out by themselves. That is all they saw. Weak, vulnerable Dog-kin. They would have been terrified had they known they were facing Shadow Hounds. The Hounds could have turned on them and destroyed them in a heartbeat. But they were pacifists. They would rather go into slavery than cause violence.""  
  
He lifted up his miniature version of \*Chain Breaker\*. ""Valen refused to let that happen. He grabbed the halberd, ran out of Sanctuary, and did the violence the Hounds would not. He killed the slavers to save the pacifists. Who does that sound like, son? Can't you see? If you're not the reincarnation, you are the heir to the mantle.""  
  
There was a shift in the body language of my found family. I knew I would have to take on this mantle. It wasn't one I wanted; I certainly didn't feel like I deserved it. But it was something that had to be done, and I was the only one who could do it.  
  
All I could manage was a slight head nod. But that's all that was required.  
  
Captain Marcus beamed with joy. He reached out his hand; I stood and clasped his forearm. I felt the gentle touch of my found family—Nyla, Skia, Sweet, Medusa, all laying their hands on my shoulders and back.  
  
**The Mission**
  
Captain Marcus, after a moment of us all standing there, cleared his throat again. ""Paul, as I see it, we have two things we need to do. The first is to find out how to break the magic that Tenebris uses on the slaves. I have a lead. Something you may be able to act upon. The second is that we need to get a message to Prydia Solaris and see if they will join with us to overthrow the slavery and the corruption. Then we can move.""  
  
""A lead?"" I asked, raising an eyebrow. ""What kind of lead?""  
  
""Elian. He works for Tenebris—some kind of scribe or clerk,"" Captain Marcus said, digging through some papers. ""Yes, here it is. We believe he lives in the upper part of town, but daily he goes to The Pit to work. He is of interest because we believe he knows something of how the magic works. Our men have overheard him telling other people in the bar when he's had a few too many.""  
  
He paused, looking grave. ""If we take him, there would be a civil war. But you are not part of the guard. You can act where I can't.""  
  
The captain continued as he looked over his paper. ""He attends The Thirsty Man. The Thirsty Man is a tavern in the upper part of Silk City. If you catch him there, you may be able to take him and question him.""  
  
I could see Medusa shift her body language, saying what her words didn't. I turned to her and took her hand. ""Medusa, you're not comfortable with this.""  
  
Medusa, looking reluctant, shook her head. ""This man has done nothing to us. We don't know what kind of person he is. Maybe he's a good man working for an evil man. I'm not comfortable kidnapping somebody, especially when we don't know if he deserves it.""  
  
""Medusa, I could tell you that sometimes good people have to do bad things. And that is true. But taking this man is not a bad thing. We're not going to torture him. We may scare him some."" I couldn't help but glance at Skia. ""But we do not need to kill him if he's not an evil man.""  
  
I said the words, but I could see she wasn't happy with the idea.  
  
Nyla put her hand on Medusa's shoulder. The snakes of Medusa's hair coiled around her wrist affectionately. ""Medusa, I don't think we need to kidnap him. We just need the information from him.""  
  
You could see Nyla's brows furrowing as she thought. ""We know he likes to drink. How much do you want to bet we can get him to talk a lot more if a beautiful woman was to seem interested?""  
  
She looked directly at Skia.  
  
Skia looked with surprise, taking a step back. She looked between me and Nyla. ""Why does everyone keep looking at me?""  
  
Nyla walked over to Skia. ""Think of this as a game. You get to play the part of a seductive woman. Convince this man he should talk to you. This should be easy. You're beautiful, and your innocence works in your favor.""  
  
A huge grin formed on Sweet's face as she chuckled. ""I think this is a great idea. And don't worry, Skia. Your family will not be far away.""  
  
**Preparation**
  
After bidding the captain farewell, we made our way back to Sanctuary. On our way, Nyla insisted that we stop at a tailor, insisting that Skia needed new clothes.  
  
I was fine with this idea, up until I got a good look at the outfits the women were considering. This is my family, and at heart, I'm a farm boy. Each time they had Skia try on a different outfit, I became more and more uncomfortable.  
  
Nyla saw me. While Skia was changing, and Sweet and Medusa were looking at some different outfits, she came over to me.  
  
""My smelly wolf thingy, what's wrong?"" She put her arm over my shoulders, looking me in the eye. There was a look of amusement and affection there.  
  
I looked at her and said, ""Skia is such an innocent person. I'm not sure we're doing the right thing.""  
  
Nyla kissed me. Pulling back, she said, ""That's why I love you so much. You put your family before anything. You crossed the known world for your sister. And for our adopted daughter, who is really just our age, you're uncomfortable exploiting her innocence.""  
  
She squeezed my shoulder gently. ""But don't think of it as exploiting her innocence. This is not us taking advantage of her. She is performing a role. I chose her not just because she was the most likely to succeed, but because I knew it would push her out of her comfort zone and make her stretch her muscles. Yes, she's innocent, but she is more than just a child.""  
  
**The Thirsty Man**
  
The next day, we arrived at The Thirsty Man in the evening. Captain Marcus had sent a man to help point out the target. We had Medusa and Sweet take up positions at the front and back of the tavern.  
  
Nyla and I went in and sat down at the first available table. The tavern was what you would expect. Not a rundown joint, but a fairly nice establishment. Wooden floors, tables with individual chairs. Several barmaids were dressed in scant outfits.  
  
The Captain's man made eye contact and then secretly pointed to Elian.  
  
He was sitting alone at his own table. You could see he'd already consumed several glasses of wine.  
  
Skia walked in, stunning and nervous at the same time. Nyla caught her eye and then, with a subtle look, directed her toward Elian.  
  
Skia tried to casually walk over to Elian and failed miserably. She stumbled on her way.  
  
This actually turned out for the better. Elian stood up and turned just as Skia stumbled, causing him to catch her. Elian, having been drinking, thought it was his fault and began to apologize.  
  
Elian fumbled over himself. ""I'm so sorry, young woman. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you? I... I guess I did. I've been drinking a little much.""  
  
Skia laid her hand on Elian's shoulder. ""No, no. It's okay. I'm perfectly fine.""  
  
Elian, looking at Skia for the first time, was stunned into silence. He simply stood there, staring at her.  
  
Skia, looking at Elian, tilted her head to the side, waiting expectantly.  
  
To her, she had said the last thing. \*Isn't he supposed to say something?\* she thought to herself.  
  
Elian realized he was just standing there not saying anything while a beautiful young woman looked at him curiously. Then he realized her hand was still on his shoulder.  
  
He began to stutter. ""I... um... I... yes. Yes. So, yes, can I get you a drink? As an apology?""  
  
Skia nodded her head happily, not really understanding what just happened. Of course, she could see he had gotten hotter. She hoped he wasn't getting sick. She sat at his table, unconscious of the effect she seemed to be having on him.  
  
Skia thought for a minute, wondering what she should say, her innocent eyes never leaving Elian's face.  
  
Elian, not used to having beautiful women stare at him, tried to fill the void. ""So, young woman, what's your name? I don't think I've ever seen someone who looks quite like you.""  
  
""Skia. My name is Skia."" She started fiddling with her outfit. ""Is there something wrong with the way I look?""  
  
Elian, looking horrified at the prospect of having insulted her, reassured her quickly. ""No! There's nothing wrong with you. It's just... I've never... well, never mind.""  
  
Realizing that he probably shouldn't tell her that he wasn't used to beautiful women, he quickly ordered two drinks, which the barmaid brought over.  
  
They began to talk. Well, \*he\* began to talk. All she did was sit there nodding as Elian spoke, looking at him without judgment, genuinely interested in what he had to say. He started to spill his whole life story to the first sympathetic ear he'd found in years.  
  
Between the alcohol and Skia listening sympathetically, it wasn't long before Elian began to boast.  
  
""You see, it's not just the brand,"" Elian said, lowering his voice conspiratorially. ""When the brand is applied, there is a mineral in the bandage that's laid on top of the brand. That mineral is the key. It's mined from Iron City. They don't even know what they're mining. We get it at a discount because nobody realizes it's the source of the pain. When the brand is applied and the mineral is soaked on top of it, it allows the magic to bind to the person.""  
  
Elian's words were slurred but clear enough.  
  
Skia looked at him, horrified. He was bragging about how he discovered it. She realized this was the man who was responsible for the pain of her adopted father.  
  
Nyla realized what was about to happen and moved, leaving me sitting there.  
  
Nyla slammed into the table. She caught her foot claws in the wood of the floor, bracing her shoulder against the edge of the table across from Elian. She sprung like a coil under pressure.  
  
The table hit Elian hard. All of the bottles went flying. Elian flew back, landing on his back, unconscious.  
  
Nyla spun. I had started moving. I could feel the rumble and see silverware dancing on the tables. Skia was beginning to transform.  
  
Nyla looked at her pleadingly. ""Skia, please! We need to leave. Now!""

1qfvze7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qfvze7/i_used_to_work_at_brooks_brothers_hardware_store/,I Used to Work at Brooks Brothers' Hardware Store Part I," 

The Brooks Brother’s Hardware store stood alone on its main street block. Chipped layers of white-washed paint contrasted the darkness inside the tall narrow windows. Faded posters advertising Case knives and hand tools hung in the ground level windows, but the only thing in the second story windows, was a thick layer of cobwebs. Tonight, however the faint flicker of candle light betrayed the fact someone was upstairs.

The autumn breeze carried my breath away in white puffs as I lingered across the street, gripping my Maglite in shivering hands. I missed my coat, purposefully forgotten inside a few hours earlier. I took a deep breath of cold air and stepped into the street.

 

I started working for Mr. Brooks after getting passed over for an internship with the \*Henderson Falls Gazette\*. I was interested in investigative journalism and thought the internship would be a great segue into that career, and might even lead to a job covering the police beat after I graduated. At any rate, it would look great on a resume. Unfortunately, the editor’s son got the position, and I found myself turning in an application to Henderson Falls’ oldest business.

I think part of the reason Mr. Brooks hired me was so he could have a captive audience. As a senior member of the county’s historical society and a frequent contributor to the local paper, his mind was a repository for obscure and trivial facts about local history, especially as it pertained to his family. He never missed an opportunity to bring up Captain Brooks, one of the earliest members of his family to settle in Henderson County, Civil War hero, and founder of the Brooks Brothers’ Hardware Store.

Mr. Brooks kept a family history scrapbook with a section detailing the life, military service, and entrepreneurial pursuits of this earliest known relative. Clippings from the historical society’s newsletter mingled with pages copied from Civil War history books and hand-written notes from Mr. Brooks himself. They painted a clear, albeit concise picture of the man’s life.

According to the Old Man, Captain Brooks settled near Henderson Falls with his family at the age of 12, just in time for the 1850 census. The 1860 census, listed him as head of a household with 2 children. In 1861, records of troops mustered from Henderson County show he enlisted in the 34\^(th) Ohio Infantry in either in April or May. Somehow, though probably through breveting, he obtained the rank of Captain by the end of the war. Shortly after, he returned to his family and started the Brooks Brothers Lumber company, later expanding into building materials and general hardware. By the time the 1880s arrived, Brooks Brothers’ Hardware Store was the largest building in town, boasting 2 storys, a scale for the grist mill, and even a spur off the B. & O. Railroad.

“And you know what else Tommy,” Mr. Brooks would say. “The Captain might’a gone to the house of representatives too if it weren’t for all that trouble with them damn Leylands.”

I nodded politely the first few times I heard about Captain Brooks. The stories were interesting, but you can only be so invested in the history of someone else’s relative. As Summer came to an end and I began my Junior year at Henderson Falls High, the Old Man moved on from talking about Captain Brooks, and started telling me about the history of Brooks Brothers’ Hardware itself. According to Mr. Brooks, post-Civil War Ohio saw a veritable boom in industry, construction, and manufacturing; and his family’s hardware store was there just in time to take advantage of it. He claimed Brooks Brothers sold many of the furnishings to the courthouse when it was refurbished in 1867, served as the county’s largest retail store, even stocked some of the first cans of paint from some up-and coming paint store out of Cleveland. You could tell from the gleam in his eye and the excitement in his words, he still looked at Brooks Brothers as a major business concern in Henderson Falls. I humored him. In spite of the once great store’s run-down appearance, shrinking nightly bank deposits, and dwindling customer base, Mr. Brooks’ enthusiasm was infectious.

That long summer stocking shelves, cleaning and making minor repairs familiarized me with all the quirks of the place. I knew the third bank of lights took longer to turn on because the ballasts were going bad. I could walk over the sagging hardwood floors without looking down. I even knew about the long crack creeping up the masonry, hidden behind a banner advertising a defunct brand of lead paint. The only part of the store I hadn’t ventured into was the second floor.

One slow, rainy day in June while looking for something to do, I decided to sort through the pile of merchandise covering the stairs behind the counter. The clutter on the bottom steps was all overstock: 16 penny nails, drywall screws, spools of fence wire, things it made sense to keep in the store instead of the warehouse. But the higher up the stairs I looked the older and more out of place the items seemed. Old tangles of hemp rope, wooden pulley blocks, asbestos floor tiles, even a box of old cut nails, rendered the path upstairs all but impassable. I climbed the first few steps, curious to see what else was in the heap of inventory when Mr. Brooks shouted at me.

“You! Get down from there, boy!” His voice shook with anger. I had no idea what caused my mild-mannered boss to go ballistic like that. In the few seconds it took for me to clamber around the junk back downstairs, Mr. Brooks’ expression softened back into that of a friendly old man.

“I didn’t mean to snap at you like that Tommy, but it ain’t safe up there.”

“I’m sorry Mr. Brooks. I just noticed all this inventory laying around and thought it’d look better if these things were cleared away.”

He raised a wrinkled hand, dismissing my concern. “I know you were just trying to help, but you need to stay down here. I haven’t been up there since the 50s.”

“Why not? The upstairs seems like a great place for storing inventory.”

The old man scratched his stubble. “If it was safe up there, you bet I’d keep some of our stock up there. I don’t trust that floor though. You’ve seen the ceiling over there next to the paint mixer?” He gestured to the front of the store, where a thin sheet of veneer plywood covered a swath of tiles on the high ceiling.

“I was up there one day, rough housing with my kid brother, Mike, you’ve never met him. Well anyway, we both ended up wraslin’ over a weak spot on the floor. The roof must’a had a leak and dry-rotted it. Long story short, my dad had to pull me and Mikey both out of the hole by our Buster Browns. Believe me, there’s no reason for you to go up there.”

 

My keys jangled as I turned the lock. I looked over my shoulder one last time, scanning the street for any witnesses before entering the inky darkness of the store. I tried to calm myself. I had done nothing wrong at this point. If anyone noticed me coming into the store at this hour, my cover story was plausible enough.

“I just stopped by to get my coat. I must have forgot it when I was locking up.”

 It somehow seemed less believable as I advanced over the warped wooden floorboards. Each footfall creaked. My pulse quickened as I walked along once familiar aisles. Claw hammers, spirit levels, auger bits, were all reduced by darkness to indiscernible, globby shadows. I wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but the old building made me nervous at night. As the days grew shorter, my pace walking to the front door after switching off the breakers for the store lights became faster and faster. I imagined the long aisles harboring some invisible presence, just behind me until I made it to the safety of the streetlights outside.

Finally, I reached the clerk’s desk in the back corner. My coat hung from the back of the tall chair, right where I left it. I slipped it on, glad for the warmth. The streetlamps outside provided just enough light for me to make out the shape of the stairs leading to the second story. As I gazed up the stairwell, trying to see the yellow glow I’d noticed from the street, I felt thin cold fingers gripped the back of my neck. I spun around ready to yell out of fear when I saw a single finger pressed against her lips.

“Are you \*trying\* to get us busted?” Jess hissed through clenched teeth.

“Maybe you shouldn’t sneak up on me like that.”

“What took you so long?” Jess rolled her head to one side as she leaned against the clerk’s desk. Her gum popped, punctuating her sentence.

“There wasn’t any parking outside the movie theater. I had to park down past the coffee shop and walk the rest of the way.”

“\*Riiight\*, then you had stare at the building for five minutes.” Jess scrunched up the bridge of her nose, teasing me.

 

Jess was Mr. Brooks’ granddaughter. I was busy stocking shelves one day in late July when she came into the store and wandered down the center aisle. Jess played varsity tennis and was one of Henderson Falls High’s cheerleaders. I had a huge crush on her at the time, but she was always surrounded by her group of jocks and preps, and I never had the guts to approach her. I heard Mr. Brooks climb off his stool in the back of the store and walk to meet her. They exchanged some words, too quiet for me to hear.

“Hey, Tommy. Come over here. I got someone for you to meet.”

I made my way to where they stood standing. Mr. Brooks wasted no time. “Tom, this is my granddaughter, Jess.”

We exchanged awkward smiles. In a school as small as Henderson Falls High, you know everyone, even if you don’t have classes together.

 Mr. Brooks went on. “She just got back from vacation down in Florida and we decided she ought’a take part in the family business. She’ll start next week. I need you to show her the ropes for me.”

 

 After work, I was more than a bit excited to tell my friend Kyle about my new coworker.

“Duuude! You’re working with Jessica Brooks? The cheerleader?”

“Yeah man, I’m pretty stoked.”

“That’s legit, son! If her friends come into the store, you gotta tell me.”

“Why?”

“Well… she’s friends with Robin Gardner. She could probably put in a good word for me, and if I just happen to stop by at the same time…”

“Kyle, why the hell would a bunch of cheerleaders want to hang out in a run-down hardware store?”

“Hey man, a guy can dream.”

It didn’t take long to realize working with Jess was not as Kyle put it “legit”. A typical shift with her started with Mr. Brooks leaving the store around 3:30, giving us a sly look over his shoulder and saying something like, “Now don’t you kids have too much fun.” Once he was out of sight, Jess would plop down in the desk chair behind the Case knife display. The week she started I tried showing her how to stock shelves, fill out hand receipts for customers, just basic stuff you’d expect from a hardware clerk. The most engagement I got from her was a nod or a few unconvincing words like “Wow, thanks for showing me” or “I’ll make sure to remember that.” Despite the simplicity of the job, she rarely helped restock shelves or clean up around the place. Instead, she spent most of her shift behind the desk, scrolling on her phone, doing homework, or passing customers off to me under the guise of ignorance. The closest thing to work she did was re-pricing items. Most of the store’s stock actually came from large box stores and was repriced for the local market. I discovered this when I noticed the remnants of a Home Depot sticker Jess either gave up on or forgot to remove entirely from a box of machine screws.

For the first few days she worked with me, I tried making conversation, but we didn’t seem to have a lot in common. If it didn’t have to do with school gossip, sports, or the music she listened to, she didn’t seem interested in talking about it. Strangely, when she lost interest in social media and had nothing else to do, I caught her flipping through the Brooks Family History Scrapbook and an old leatherbound book I’d never seen before. It seemed to start out of boredom, just another way to pass the time, but she seemed to become progressively more interested in her grandfather’s scrapbook and the leather book. She never struck me as a history person, but I wrote it off as more of an interest in her own family than anything. Despite the various diversions she had, Jess still found time to bother me.

Sometimes she would interrupt me from whatever book I was reading. By now, any excitement about working with her was gone. I would have rather worked alone instead of doing everything while she sat around. I stopped trying to make small talk with her and focused on doing my job.

“I don’t see how you can sit there, reading like that, Tom Boy”, she said smirking. I hated when she called me that.

“Why not?” I asked, not lifting my eyes from the pages.

“It just seems like such a boring way to spend your time.” She reclined in her chair, popping bubblegum between her teeth.

Another time, maybe while we were eating lunch behind the counter, she sighed loudly.

“It’s so unfair I have to work tomorrow. Stacey and Molly are going shopping without me.”

I knew she wanted me to cover her shift. Old Man Brooks had me scheduled from open to noon. I planned on meeting my friends on a camping trip, maybe do some hiking, kayaking, or just hang out by the lake. I said nothing.

She rolled her eyes. “What are you doing with \*your\* day off,” she asked.

“It’s not a day off,” I said. “I have to come in from open to noon. After that, I’ll probably meet up with Kyle and John at the lake.”

“That’s just the way you people are,” she smirked.

“What do you mean ‘you people’?”

“You know,” Jess blushed. “Country people living out of town. All you care about is being in the woods, hunting, and fishing, that stuff .”

I’d never been hunting in my life and thought fishing was boring. I decided to spare her the irony. She never showed up that afternoon and I had to close the store. I still went to the lake, but by then it was nearly dark and there wasn’t much to do but sit by the fire after a long day’s work.

The Saturday before fall break Mr. Brooks scheduled both of us to work on what turned out to be the busiest weekend we had in months. From the time we opened until late afternoon, a steady stream of customers came in for various items. When the chronically late Jess finally showed up, she wasn’t much help. Instead of helping customers herself, she referred them to me if there was something they couldn’t find or if they needed advice. I heard her say things like:

“I don’t know anything about plumbing Mr. Stevens, but Tom is basically a plumbing expert.”

“I totally forget how the paint mixer works Mrs. Anders, but Tom would be happy to mix those colors for you.”

“That truckload of mulch you ordered is right out back Mr. Lawson. Why don’t you pull around and Tom Boy can help you load everything before the rain picks up. I’m sure you can both get everything onto your trailer before the downpour really starts.”

I cringed. I hated it when she called me Tom Boy.

Sweat and rain soaked my clothes when I finally got back in the store. Jessica sat, scrolling through her phone with one hand, talking to yet another customer. Seeing me, her face lit up.

“Oh, here he comes! Tom, Mrs. Sandborn is looking for…”

“How about you do something for once and help her,” I snapped. “I’m going to lunch.”

The elderly woman’s mouth hung open, shocked by my rudeness. I grabbed my coat and walked out the front door. On the drive to the McDonalds, I cursed the bad weather and Jess’s laziness. In the short drive across town, my anger welled up inside me. I was pissed off I didn’t get the Gazette internship. I was pissed off Jess got paid to sit on her ass while I did all the work around the store. I was pissed off the line in the drive though was moving so slow.

When I finally got my food, I sped off from the drive through window, cursing under my breath, anticipating a screwed-up order and half-empty carton of fries. I parked a block away from the hardware store, not wanting Jess or Mrs. Sandborn to see me. I was still angry at Jess and realized what vocalizing my frustrations might lead to. I didn’t want to lose my job for yelling at the boss’s granddaughter. I also felt guilty about the way I treated poor Mrs. Sandborn. She was just a poor old woman looking for… something, just to get yelled at. She didn’t deserve that. She also looked familiar and I was sure my grandfather knew her just like he knew everyone else over 50 in Henderson Falls. It was only a matter of time until she ran into Grandpa, or worse, Mr. Brooks and complained about the rude young man working at the hardware store.

I finished my meal and sat in my car for the rest of my lunch break. My rage abated, leaving me anxious about returning to work. I decided to go into the store bearing an olive branch. I’d apologize to my Jess, maybe offer to cover her shift some weekend and hopefully get through the rest of the day without incident.

I noticed the lack of customers as soon as I stepped into the store. The murmur of questions from customers was replaced by the sound of the overhead heater. I found Jess, hunched over in her usual spot behind the Case knife display. It took a moment to realize Jess wasn’t scroll on her phone or doing homework. She was crying.

“Jess?”

She looked up at me through teary eyes. For the first time, I felt genuinely bad for how I snapped at her.

“I just wanted to say sorry for… earlier.” I stood awkwardly, waiting for her response.

“Why do you hate me Tom?”

“I don’t hate you. I… You’re just a lazy co-worker I have to deal with.”  

I regretted the words as I said them. I felt my anger coming back and tried to keep a cool head.

She sniffled and wiped her eyes with an oversized sweater sleeve. “You never want to talk to me,” she sniffed. “You ignore me all day. You never even say ‘Hi’ to me when I clock in.”

I didn’t know what to say. “Look Jess I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you. It’s been a long day. I don’t want to-“

“Don’t want to what? Lose your Job?” She gazed up at me through puffy red eyes.  

“Of course not!”

“We’re both going to lose our jobs, Tom.” Jess buried her head in her arms and burst into fresh sobs. I frowned, confused by the turn the conversation took.

“Why would your grandfather fire you?”

“Because the store is going out of business.” She raised her head up. “Every night, the deposits are getting smaller and smaller. I found these stuffed into grandpa’s ledger.”

She rummaged through the stack of mail beside her and pulled out a stack of envelopes.

“Last Notice, Late Fee, Past Due, Overdrawn.” She slid them from her hand to the desk like she was dealing cards. The sender’s names coupled with the red stamped messages worried me. Henderson County Tax Office, Nibco Plumbing Supply, Third Street Bank, Henderson County Rural Electric, a few miscellaneous suppliers for merchandise not purchased and resold from other stores.

For the life of me I couldn’t figure out why Jess cared so much about the rundown hardware store. She didn’t seem interested in the actual management of the place.I doubted she had hopes of one day running it herself. I remembered her perusing Old Man Brooks’ scrapbook. Maybe it was a matter of familial pride. I dragged my stool closer to Jess and tried to comfort her.

“I know this looks bad, but what’s the worst that can happen? I’ll find a new job somewhere else, and so will you. Mr. Brooks is old enough to retire anyway, don’t you think he’d like to get out of this place and-”

“That’s the thing, Tom. He can’t retire. He puts everything into keeping this place open. Any profit he turns goes right back into paying for more products and paying the bills.” Jess tapped the old-fashioned ledger on her desk. “You know how much money the store has in it’s checking account? It’s less than $100.”

“Just because the store is broke doesn’t mean the Old Man is.”

“Look at your paychecks, Tom Boy”, she said, without her usual mockery. “They don’t say ‘Brooks Bros. Hardware’. They say Simon J. Brooks, because he shares an account with the store.”

I furrowed my brow as I thought. Surely there was a way out of this mess.

“Maybe he can sell the place and walk away with a nice profit. An investor could renovate this building, just like the other ones downtown.”

“Do you \*really\* think anyone would want to buy this place?” Jess raised a challenging eyebrow.

I shrugged. I knew there were some people buying up the old historic properties and ‘gentrifying’ them. Somehow our dusty hardware store didn’t seem a likely place for coffee, vinyl LPs or whatever else the hipsters downtown liked.

“And even if he could find a buyer, it’d break his heart selling this place. It would absolutely devastate him.”

There was no denying that. Maybe the old man was a bit detached from reality and given to romanticizing the importance of the family business, but I think that made this sudden revelation of the place’s impending demise that much more tragic. I dropped my head as I racked my brain for some words to comfort Jess. Suddenly I felt a warm hand close over my wrist.

“I’ve been reading through some of grandpa’s notes. There might be a way out of this mess, but grandpa would never go through with it.”

I raised my head to see Jess looking at me with pleading eyes. “Will you help me Tom?”

 

My watch read 11:48.

“Do you have everything we need?”

Jess slapped her backpack. “It’s all in here. We just need to get set up before midnight.” She pulled a pink wad of gum from her mouth and smashed it under the desk before rising.

“Let’s go,” she said, wrapping her cold fingers around my hand and dragging me to the foot of the stairs. I felt like a kid reaching into a cookie jar, wondering if they were about to get caught. The wooden stair treads represented the point of no return. If Mr. Brooks or anyone else saw us reason, I’d be caught doing what he explicitly told me to never do.

I clicked my flashlight on, shielding most of the light with my hand. Faint marks left behind by Jess’s Chuck Taylors showed the path through decades of accumulated junk and old merchandise, all but blocking the stairway. I watched Jessica’s long legs retrace steps she had apparently taken earlier. I followed her with my logging boots, trying not to disturb anything. The higher we climbed and the less cluttered the stairs, the more noticeable our footprints became in contrast to the decades of dust. Without all the junk to distract the eye, Mr. Brooks would surely notice this evidence of disturbance.

The door at the landing creaked on rusty hinges. Loose panes of glass rattled as it bumped the lath and plaster wall behind it. The room was exactly as Mr. Brooks described it: an overflow for outdated hardware. Scythes hung from rafters, motheaten burlap bags covered tables, and tendrils of leather straps from horse and carriage days spilled into the narrow walkway. There was even the odd sickle hanging from a nail on the pillars, swaying as our footsteps caused the old floor to creak and at times, noticeably bow under our weight.

Jess picked up her stubby plumber’s candle from floor, leaving behind a small ring of coagulating white wax. We ventured deeper into the musty room. Any doubt surrounding Mr. Brooks’ story of nearly falling through a weak spot in the floor vanished as my flashlight played over the section of splintered wood and exposed floor joists near the front of the store. I realized we might be in real danger of falling through ourselves. Jess led me deeper into the maze of cast-off wares. At one point while, scanning the room I accidentally slammed my knee into the exposed springs of an old mattress sitting on a wrought iron bedframe. I cringed at the rusty squeaks. Jess giggled at my muffled curses. Our narrow walkway gave way to a large clearing. The expanse was mostly unused space. I might have paid more attention to the wall of wooden shelves or the partitioned off room near the front corner of the building but my attention was captured by a hulking rectangular form sitting behind a stained rug.

Gold pinstripes outlining the safe door glittered as we approached. A large, five spoke wheel was mounted beneath the dial. Decades of use had worn through the nickel plating, exposing the brass beneath. The safe’s most striking feature was a portrait of a man’s face painted above a scroll of gilded letters reading: “C. W. Brooks & Bros. HDWE Co. Est. 1868.” Like tintype photographs of the era, his expression was stern, no trace of a grin, and if there was any mirth in his eyes, the artist failed to capture it. I felt a strange uncanniness as I looked at the bearded man’s face, ultimately chalking it up to a family resemblance to my employer. I wondered if the old man had ever seen the portrait of Captain Brooks.

“We don’t have much time,” Jess said. She kicked the red and gold rug away from the safe, revealing a circular, black stain on the floor.

I followed Jess’s lead and knelt on the opposite side of the stain, watching her produce a sheet of onionskin paper and a thin board from her backpack. I sat across from her and clicked off my flashlight before setting it aside. She set her candle to the side illuminating the typewritten paper before unfolding the board in the center of the stain. It featured a row of numbers from zero to ten, the alphabet in capital letters, and the words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in opposite corners. The caption at the top read ‘Ouija’.

“This is what you dragged me up here for? All this over a damn Ouija Board?”

“Look, If you go into this with the wrong mindset, you \*will\* have a bad time.”

I looked over the thing, half-expecting to find the Hasbro logo on one of the corners, but looking closer, it seemed genuinely old. It wasn’t modern cardboard; it looked more like the antique boxes I found in the warehouse. It had a dull appearance and some of the letters were partially worn away, either due to age or frequent use. I looked at the paper and read the lines closest to me.

1. DO NOT use in a graveyard.

2. Wait until the planchet stops on good-bye to put board away.

3. If the board starts counting down from-

“Or it might not work at all,” Jess interrupted, tilting her head to one side. “And we’ll have wasted all this time for nothing.”

“Alright, fine. Where’d you get this thing anyway?”

“Kathy Connors. She gave me these instructions, board and planchet for the ritual,” she continued, holding up a wooden pointer and setting it down on the board. I frowned. It hadn’t occurred to me before agreeing to do this, honestly, I wasn’t sure what I had agreed to at all. The only thing Jess told me was the key to saving our jobs and her grandfather’s business was upstairs and that she needed help. I can’t explain it, but I felt sudden apprehension looking at the board, sitting on the blackened circle in the candle light. It rekindled a distant memory, maybe one of those humid summer mornings in the itchy pews of Henderson Falls’ First Baptist Church and a vague recollection of my pastor going on about divination not only being a sin, but the very act putting your soul at risk of demonic possession. It was unsettling to say the least.

There was also the time Kyle told me spirit boards were ‘complete bullshit’ after we saw one being used in a horror movie.

“There’s a reason they always say to never play alone,” he said as the B-Movie we pirated flickered on the projector in his basement. “If you did, there’d be nobody to move that wooden thing.”

All that said, I felt reluctance at the thought of taking part in what basically amounted to a séance. I pushed these thoughts from my mind. If Jess really wanted to go to all this trouble just to sit cross-legged on the floor and wait for a message from beyond the ethers that wasn’t coming, that was on her.

With everything in order, Jess closed her eyes and took a deep breath before looking up at me.

“Are you ready?”

“I guess? What are we doing exactly?”

“Using a Ouija board.”

“I got that part, but why?”

She groaned as she looked at her Apple watch. “Look, we have five minutes, so I’ll make this quick. Has grandpa told you about the feud between Captain Brooks and the banker G. W. Leyland?”

“Maybe once or twice.”

Jess just stared at me, expecting more. By this time, I doubted there was anything about Captain Brooks the Old Man hadn’t told me about.

“He said something about Leyland and the Captain having a feud, or something?”

Jess nodded. “He probably didn’t mention Leyland’s attempt to take over Brooks Brothers?”

“No, he didn’t.”

“I read Captain Brooks’ Journal.” Jess gestured to the leather book poking out of her backpack, the same one I’d seen her reading many times before.

“During the Panic of 1873, the store fell on hard times and needed loans to stay open. Leyland was a money lender and the two agreed to a loan in exchange for a promissory note, payable once Captain Brooks’ railroad investments recovered. It’s complicated, but after several months, Layland attempted to claim Brooks Brothers for the loan being in default. The Captain claimed Leyland forged a promissory note with different terms and even caught Leyland trying to force his way into the offices up here. There was also money missing after this visit from Leyland. The whole thing went to court and the Judge ruled in favor of a compromise between the two versions of the promissory note, since he himself couldn’t verify which one was real. Brooks Brothers was ordered to repay half the loan immediately and the remaining half upon the later note’s expiration. The store struggled after paying the first half of the loan. Rumors circulated about the Brooks family losing the store when Leyland called on the rest of the loan, and that’s when something strange happened: He never came. He went missing, days before the rest of the loan was due. People were initially suspicious of Captain Brooks, but he had an air-tight alibi. Other businesses in town came forward after his disappearance, claiming Leyland was guilty of unfair and misleading business practices, hidden balloon payments on loans, forced early repayment, interfering with businesses he’d loaned money to and trying to assume control of them. People started to think Leyland had made too many enemies in town and fled. After this, Captain Brooks’ journal entries seem to get… paranoid. He mentioned his fear of Leyland’s return. He changed the combination to the safe and wouldn’t tell anyone, not even his family what it was. He carried a revolver with him and insisted on locking the store himself each night. This went on a few months before he was found dead on this very spot.”

Jess pointed to the black stain. My skin crawled under my coat.

“What happened?”

“No one knew for sure. The coroner said it was heart failure. After witnessing his paranoia, the family probably believed it.”

“And you want to try asking his spirit for the combination to open this safe?”

“You’re really not as dumb as you look, Tommy Boy.”

“Why go to all this trouble? If there was anything in that safe, someone would have hired a locksmith a long time ago.”

“It’s a Chubbs Safe, whey were world famous their security. They used to say they were impossible to crack. I called around, but none of the locksmiths around here will touch it because it’s an antique. I found a man online who works on old safes, but he was expensive.”

“How expensive?”

“More than we make in a month.”

“Did you call and talk to the guy? Maybe he’s cheaper than you think. Or mayb-”

Jess looked at her watch. “Look, we don’t have much time, just give me your hand.”

I sighed and placed my hand on top of the planchet.

“One last thing.” Jess looked me in the eye. Her perpetual smirk vanished and her laughing eyes grew calm and focused.

“You have to promise, once we start, we keep going until the end? You got me?”

I nodded.

“And it doesn’t end until the planchet says ‘Goodbye’.”

“Alright.”

“Promise me.”

“Alright, I promise.”

“Good.” Jess rested her soft hand on top of mine. A cold handcuff bit my wrist as it ratcheted shut. I looked at the other end of the handcuff dangling from Jess’s wrist. Before I could speak she raised her free hand, dismissively.

“Just some cheap insurance,” she said.

“Insurance against what?”

Jess’s watch alarm chimed. Midnight. She straightened up and whispered, “Let me do the talking.” She slid the planchet to the center of the board.

“Is there a benevolent spirit who wishes to speak with the living?”

Jess scanned the darkness beyond our candle’s flickering light. A long silence passed before she spoke again.

“I am one of Captain Brooks’ granddaughters; is there a benevolent spirit who wishes to speak with the living?”

Wind whistled outside. The building’s roof creaked under the strain. The planchet remained a dead piece of wood in our hands. I looked around the room and saw nothing. Jess looked over my shoulder once more. Biting her lip, Jess spoke up.

“I am a descendant of Captain Brooks; is there a spirit who wishes to speak with the living?”

My heart thudded inside my chest. It wasn’t the wind picking up outside, or the sudden chill in the air, or Jess trembling across from me. It was the planchet moving. Not under the guidance of Jess’s hand, or mine, but some invisible force. It slid slowly to the word “Yes”, before returning to the center of the board.

Jess went pale, but smiled uneasily. “Who are we speaking with?”

The pointer skated across the board, spelling out a message.

“Captain Brooks.”

Jess’s face lit up with triumph. “We came to ask you-”

But the planchet kept moving “You shouldn’t be here Jess. He got me, now he’s coming for you. Leave now.”

The pointer moved towards ‘Goodbye’. It was nearly there when it shot back to the center of the board. Heavy footfalls echoed through the room.

Jess shook her head in stunned silence.

I scanned the room but saw nothing. “Who’s there?”

The board spelled out “Leyland.”

“We’re here on behalf of Mr. Brooks.” Jess shuddered as she spoke.

“Another Brooks in financial trouble. How predicable.”

Jess wiped tears from her eyes before speaking. “Mr. Leyland, I know you and the captain had- difficulties. But we need help opening the safe.”

A cold breeze burst through the room, carrying a madman’s laugh. Our weak light source trembled, sputtering and threatening to go out until the gust exhausted itself and the flame steadied.

“I help no one. Especially a Brooks.”

“Mr. Leyland, please it’s a matter of saving my grandfather’s business.”

The wind rose up again. A raspy voice vocalized the board’s words slowly as the planchet spelled them out.

“This is my business.”

Jess sat speechless. Before she could speak the cursor and the voice went on.

“When I came to call on Captain Brooks’s loan, he murdered me on this very spot.”

A chill ran down my spine. I looked at the stain beneath us, suspecting for the first time it wasn’t from a water leak or spilled ink. Images of a banker dying, a safe slamming shut, and the smell of black powder smoke flashed through my mind.

“What does any of this have to do with me?” Jess cried.

“You’re family owed me a debt in life. I’m here to collect after death.”

“He can’t hurt us? Can he,” I asked. Trying not to panic.

Wicked laughter echoed through the room.

Jess looked faint when her eyes fell on Kathy Connors’ sheet of paper.

“What’s wrong,” the voice taunted. “Didn’t anyone tell you not to play in a graveyard?”

A faint metallic whir alerted us to the safe towering above us. The dial raced from one digit of it’s combination to another before stopping with a click. The five spoke wheel twisted, stopping with a metallic ‘thunk’ as the locking bars retracted. The massive door swung open on lazy hinges. Jess saw it before I did and screamed.

Inside was the dried-up husk of a man, still in a gilded age suit. Yellow wrinkled lips curled away from ivory white teeth as it stared at us with sunken, hollow eye sockets.

“Don’t you think there was a reason the captain never gave anyone the combination to this safe?”  

Jess sobbed, her pale face reddened from crying. “You don’t have to do this. I never borrowed anything from you.”

“Captain Brooks’ debt will be repaid.”

Disembodied laughter echoed through the room. The open safe swayed with each reverberation. The planchet jerked to nine and started counting down. Eight. Seven.

“It can’t get to zero, Tom! Help me!” Each time the planchet moved, we forced it back to the previous number. The resistance was startlingly strong as we shoved it back to nine. I don’t know what scared me more, not knowing what would happen if it reached zero or the fact its movements were getting harder to fight. Even with both of our hands on the thing, shoving with all our might we were losing ground. Six, five, four. The safe rocked noticeably. The floor creaked under its weight.

Jess looked to the sheet of paper, searching frantically for some way out of this. The pointer stopped on four. I braced myself and pulled with all my might. It needled closer to three but I wasn’t about to let it get there. I wasn’t just fighting the planchet, I was fighting panic, a tired grip, sweaty hands. The safe shook violently next to us. I cried out in pain as the planchet ripped free from my fingers.  

Three. Two. One.

Before it could get to zero, Jess flipped the board upside down.

“Tom, look out!”

 The handcuff bit into my wrist as Jess lunged from our circle of light, dragging me with her. The candle got knocked over, plunging us into darkness. A deafening crash rattled the bones of the building as the safe fell face first to the floor where Jess and I were sitting just moments before. Before we could share this moment of relief, a blackened figure rose from behind ruins of the safe.  ",2,1768702313.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qfvxjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qfvxjr/till_deathand_after_un_shortened_version/,Till Death-and After. (un shortened version.),"Max leans back against the weight bench, arms crossed, a lazy grin on his face as he talks about the girl from his class. Lily. Pretty, smart, funny. He says her name like it’s nothing, like it doesn’t settle heavy in your chest.

“You know what?” he adds, glancing down at you. “I think I might ask her out this weekend.”

“No—don’t,” you say before you can stop yourself.

He blinks, clearly caught off guard. “Whoa. Okay.” He lets out a nervous laugh, scratching the back of his neck. “Didn’t realize you had such strong feelings about my dating life.” His eyes narrow slightly. “You look… jealous.”

You shake your head too fast. “No. It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”

Max studies you the way he always has, like he’s reading between the lines you never say out loud. He steps closer, blocking your escape. “Dude, you’re a terrible liar. Always have been. What’s going on?”

“I said it’s nothing.”

He scoffs. “Nothing my ass.” His voice drops, serious now. “You never get this worked up. Especially not over who I date.”

“Quit pushing,” you snap quietly. “Before I say something I can’t take back.”

That finally makes him back off—but only for a second. Frustration flashes across his face. “Fine. Keep your secrets.” He turns away, muttering under his breath, then stops. “But if you’re gonna be a moody bitch about who I date, maybe I should—”

“I’m sorry.”

He freezes and looks back at you. “You’re… sorry?” He steps closer, his tone softer now. “You’re sorry for being jealous over some girl I haven’t even asked out yet?”

You swallow. “I’m sorry for letting my feelings get in the way of your happiness.”

The words hang between you like a dropped weight.

Max stares at you, shock draining the color from his face. “Wait. Did you just say… feelings?” He sits down beside you slowly. “Like—real feelings?”

“Forget it,” you mutter, already trying to stand.

He grabs your arm, firm but not rough. “Nope. Sit.” He pulls you back down, turning to face you fully, his knee brushing yours. “You don’t get to drop a bomb like that and run.”

“It’s better for our friendship if I don’t say anything.”

His grip tightens. “Better for our friendship—or better for hiding whatever the hell is going on in your head?” His voice lowers. “We’ve been best friends forever.”

You sigh. “I know.”

He exhales slowly, running a hand through his hair. “I know I’m not great with feelings. But I know you. Better than anyone.” He looks at you. “Tell me.”

You hesitate, heart pounding, then finally whisper, “I’m gay. And I’m in love with you.”

For a moment, Max doesn’t move.

Then he stands abruptly, pacing back and forth. “Holy shit,” he mutters. “Holy fucking shit.” He drags his hands through his hair. “My best friend is in love with me. And he’s gay.”

He stops and takes a breath before sitting back down, leaving a small space between you. “Okay. Okay. I just… need a minute.”

“I’m sorry—”

“No,” he cuts in immediately. “Don’t apologize.” He shakes his head. “I had no clue.”

“You weren’t supposed to.”

He looks at you carefully. “When did this start?”

“Since sophomore year.”

His jaw drops. “Three years?” He looks down at his hands. “That explains a lot.” Then back at you. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

“You’re straight,” you say quietly. “I didn’t want to lose you.”

His expression hardens—not with anger, but disbelief. “You really thought I’d abandon you?”

“Yes.”

He snaps back, hurt flashing in his eyes. “After everything we’ve been through? You thought I’d drop you because you’re gay and in love with me?”

“That’s usually what happens.”

“That’s not how we work,” he says firmly. “I’m not that guy.”

Silence stretches between you.

Finally, he rubs his temples and exhales. “I thought we were just… us. Two guys being best friends.” He swallows. “Did that mean all the hugs—”

“No,” you say quickly. “Don’t overthink it.”

He lets out a humorless laugh. “How the hell am I supposed to not overthink this?”

“I’m sorry.”

He reaches out, gripping your shoulder. “Stop apologizing. I’m not mad at you. I’m mad you thought you had to hide this from me.” He softens. “I’m your best friend.”

“I know.”

He leans back again. “This is going to take time to process.” He looks at you seriously. “I need to ask you something. Be honest.”

You nod.

“Do you still have feelings for me?”

Your throat tightens. You try to speak, but nothing comes out.

He gently lifts your chin so you have to look at him. “Answer me.”

“Yes.”

He nods slowly. “Okay.” He exhales. “So for three years, you’ve been in love with your straight best friend.”

“Yeah.”

He gives a quiet, almost sad laugh. “That’s a shitty hand to be dealt.”

Then he grows serious. “I’m not going to lie and say this doesn’t change things. Because it does.”

You nod, bracing yourself.

Max doesn’t answer right away.

He just stares at you, jaw tight, eyes searching your face like he’s trying to memorize something before it disappears. The room feels too quiet, too charged.

“So… that’s it?” he finally asks. “You’re just… free now?”

You shrug, trying to keep it light even though your chest aches. “Yeah. I mean, now that you know, I don’t have to keep pretending. I can date. I don’t have to feel guilty about it.”

He nods, slow and careful, like he’s stepping through a minefield. “Yeah. That makes sense.” Then, softer, almost strained: “You gonna start dating now?”

“Maybe,” you say. “I’ve got nothing holding me back anymore.”

Something flickers across his face—something sharp and unreadable. “Anyone in mind?”

“There’s a guy from high school,” you say. “He texted me earlier. Wanted to go out.”

Max scoffs. “Who? Not Jake from the football team.”

“Jason,” you correct. “He wasn’t that bad.”

Max’s jaw tightens. “He was an asshole. He used to flirt with you right in front of me.”

You shrug again. “Probably gonna go out with him.”

The word probably lands like a punch.

“You’re—” He stops himself, swallows. “You’re really gonna date him?”

“If I like him,” you say slowly, confused by the edge in his voice. “Yeah.”

Max snaps, “You’d just be his boyfriend? Just like that?”

You blink. “Why are you acting weird?”

“I’m not,” he lies badly, dragging a hand through his hair. “Forget it. Do whatever you want.”

The anger drains out of him almost as fast as it came, leaving guilt behind. “I’m sorry,” he mutters. “I didn’t mean— just… forget it.”

Later that night, your phone buzzes.

What are you wearing?

You tell him. Dark purple button-up. Jeans. Cowboy boots.

There’s a pause before he replies.

Sounds like you’re trying to get laid.

You laugh it off, thumbs flying. Maybe if I’m lucky.

His response comes faster than it should.

In your fucking dreams, pretty boy.

Your heart stutters.

You tell yourself it doesn’t mean anything. That you’re just friends. That Jason probably calls everyone that.

But Max doesn’t like that thought. You can feel it bleeding through his words, turning bitter, sharp.

By the time you leave for the bar, the air between you feels stretched thin, ready to snap.

Hours pass.

Max checks his phone again. And again.

2:17 AM.

2:41 AM.

3:02 AM.

Nothing.

Worst-case scenarios start crawling through his head until he can’t take it anymore. He calls.

“Hello?” you whisper, voice low and sleepy.

Relief crashes into him so hard his knees almost give. Then irritation follows close behind.

“Where the fuck are you?” he whispers back. “And why are you whispering?”

That’s when he realizes it.

This isn’t jealousy anymore.

This isn’t protectiveness.

This is fear.

And maybe—

something else he’s been refusing to name.

Max didn’t sleep.

He lay on his back staring at the ceiling, phone discarded somewhere on the floor where he’d thrown it hours ago, jaw clenched so tightly it hurt. Every time he closed his eyes, the same images replayed uninvited—your laugh, Jason’s hands, the way you’d whispered so carefully so you wouldn’t wake him.

Jason’s still asleep. I don’t want to wake him.

Max hated how small that sentence made him feel.

He told himself he had no right to this jealousy. You were his best friend. Jason was just… Jason. A guy you met at a bar. A guy whose bed you were apparently still in. The fact that Max could imagine it so vividly—rumpled sheets, discarded clothes, your body tucked comfortably against someone who wasn’t him—made his chest ache.

By morning, it hadn’t gotten better.

Scrolling aimlessly through his phone, Max froze when Jason’s post popped up. A messy bed. Clothes scattered. A caption that might as well have been a knife: Last night was 🔥🔥. Morning coffee anyone?

Max’s stomach dropped.

He texted you before he could stop himself, the words sharp and ugly and fueled by jealousy he didn’t know how to swallow. Your replies didn’t help—casual, teasing, happy. You told him about eggs and bacon, about breakfast and showers and plans together, like this was all normal now. Like Jason was normal.

Like this was normal.

“You sound happy,” he typed eventually, hating how bitter it came out.

You didn’t hesitate.

I am. I really am.

That hurt more than anything else.

When Max told you he was coming over, he regretted it instantly—and then doubled down anyway. He needed to see you. Needed to know you were real and not just a loop of imagined moments torturing him from his bed.

Twenty minutes later, he walked into your place without knocking.

You were on the couch with Jason, close in that effortless way Max had never seen before. Jason’s hand rested casually around your ankle. You both looked up when Max entered, like this was normal too. Like Max hadn’t just driven over with his heart in his throat.

He sat where Jason had been when Jason went to the kitchen, the scent of his cologne still lingering on the cushion. It made Max’s jaw tighten.

“So,” he asked quietly, “are you guys… official?”

“Not yet,” you said.

Relief and jealousy tangled in his chest, neither winning.

Jason came back with brownies, draped an arm around your shoulders like it belonged there. You leaned into it without thinking, smiling as you talked about how amazing he was in the kitchen. Max stared at the TV, forcing himself to chew, to swallow, to breathe.

You were glowing.

Not the version of you Max knew—the sarcastic, chill, late-night-talk version—but something softer. Happier. Someone who laughed easily, who leaned into affection instead of deflecting it.

And Max realized, with a sharp, painful clarity, that he’d never been the one who made you like this.

That’s when it hit him.

He was losing you.

“I should probably get going,” he said suddenly, standing too fast.

You and Jason spoke at the same time. “Are you sure?”

That made it worse somehow—how natural it sounded, the two of you together.

Max forced a tight smile, nodded, and headed for the door before you could see the way his chest felt like it was splitting open.

Because wanting you when you were this happy—just not with him—was the cruelest thing he’d ever felt.

The door closed harder than it needed to.

Max didn’t look back as he left, but the sound echoed through the room anyway, sharp and final. For a moment, the silence felt louder than the slam itself.

Jason watched the door, brow furrowing, then turned back to you and pulled you closer with an easy familiarity. “You okay?” he asked, pressing a quick kiss to your temple. “He seemed… weird.”

You shrugged, though the feeling in your chest hadn’t settled. “Yeah. I don’t know what’s going on with him lately.”

Jason hummed, unconcerned. “Probably work.” His hands were already warm and grounding, tracing absent-minded circles as if nothing had shifted at all. Outside, unseen, Max sat in his car, hands locked around the steering wheel, knuckles white as he stared at the house like it might break him if he looked too long.

Inside, you laughed softly at something Jason said, and that was enough to make Max finally tear his eyes away.

He didn’t leave.

Instead, he came back.

The door slammed again—this time close enough to rattle the walls.

You jumped upright. “Max!”

He stopped mid-step, chest heaving, eyes flicking from your face to Jason’s. Jason barely moved, lounging like he belonged there, like Max was the one intruding.

“Get your hands off him,” Max said, voice rough, stripped of humor.

Jason raised his hands slowly, mockingly. “Whoa. Easy.” A smirk tugged at his mouth. “What’s this about—jealousy?”

“Guys, please,” you said quickly, stepping between them. “This is getting insane.”

Jason laughed under his breath, eyes never leaving Max. “Relax. He’s mine. You’ll get used to it.”

The words landed wrong. You felt it immediately.

“Jason,” you snapped, “Max is my best friend. And he’s straight. You’re being an ass.”

Max took a step back like he’d been slapped. “What the hell?” he said, looking genuinely shaken. “I’m not— I would never— I’m straight.”

“I know,” you said firmly. “He’s confused.”

“Confused about what?” Max shot back, color rising in his face. “That I don’t like guys? That I care about my best friend?”

Jason rolled his eyes. “Whatever. He’s acting like he wants to punch me every time I touch you.”

You pulled away then, putting distance between all three of you. “I’m not doing this. You two need to figure it out. I’m not the referee.”

The tension spiked instantly.

Max looked relieved—and furious. Jason looked annoyed—and challenged.

“Talk it out,” you ordered. “Now.”

Max took a breath, hands curling into fists at his sides. “I’m not jealous,” he said through clenched teeth. “I’m pissed that you think you can talk about him like he’s something you own.”

Jason pushed off the wall, smile sharp. “And I’m saying I care about him. He makes me happy. That’s it.”

For a long moment, no one spoke.

The room felt like it was holding its breath.

Max’s jaw tightened, arms folding across his chest as he tried—failed—to calm himself. “Then start acting like it,” he said quietly. “Because right now, you’re treating him like a trophy.”

Jason hesitated. Just for a second.

And in that pause, everything changed.

The fight wasn’t about jealousy.

It wasn’t about labels.

It was about love—spoken, unspoken, and dangerously close to spilling over.

Max’s arms are crossed tight over his chest, jaw locked so hard it aches.

“I get that you like him,” he says, voice rough. “I get that you’re happy with him. But stop acting like he’s yours to control. He’s my best friend. He always will be.”

Jason exhales slowly, running a hand through his hair. He steps closer, close enough to crowd Max’s space without quite touching him.

“He is mine,” Jason says calmly. “In private, he’s with me. Outside of that, he’s your best friend. You’ll deal with it.”

Something in Max snaps.

“So what—” His hands fly up, frustration spilling over. “I’m just supposed to sit back and watch you have him? Pretend it doesn’t tear me apart?”

Jason’s expression sharpens, interest flickering behind his eyes.

“Is that what this is?” he asks. “You want him?”

Silence answers for Max. His face burns, anger and embarrassment warring in his chest.

“I—I didn’t mean it like that,” Max mutters. “I just want him around. That’s all.”

Jason laughs quietly. Not kindly.

“Bullshit.”

He steps in closer, voice dropping.

“You don’t look at someone like that if you don’t want them.”

Max’s breath stutters. He hates how Jason can see straight through him—how the words drag feelings to the surface he’s spent years burying.

“Shut up,” Max whispers hoarsely. “Just—shut up.”

Jason only smirks.

“You’re not angry. You’re jealous.”

“I’m not,” Max snaps. “I’m straight.”

Jason gestures between them, between Max and you, still caught in the middle of it all.

“Then explain why you’re standing here like this.”

Max’s hands tighten at your waist before he even realizes he’s moved. The contact is instinctive—protective, desperate. His face flushes crimson as he realizes what he’s done.

Jason’s voice softens, but it cuts deeper.

“He’s wanted you for years,” he says quietly. “Since the day he met you.”

“That’s not true,” you say, heart hammering. “He knows I loved him.”

Max goes completely still.

“You remember that?” he asks, voice barely holding together.

Of course you do. Sophomore year. Too much cheap wine. Tears in your eyes. His hands warm and careful on your back as he promised nothing would change.

We can still be best friends.

“Every word,” you say.

Max closes his eyes like it hurts to hear it aloud.

“I meant it,” he whispers. “I really thought I could live with that.”

“Exactly,” you say softly. “That’s what we are. Best friends.”

Something breaks in him.

“Exactly,” Max snaps, eyes shining. “That’s all we are.”

The words come out like an accusation—like a wound he’s been pressing on for years.

“That’s all you want,” he says bitterly. “Just friends.”

“No,” you say sharply. “That’s all you wanted.”

Max freezes.

The room goes quiet. Even Jason stops smiling.

And for the first time, Max has no denial left to hide behind.

Max freezes the moment you say it.

For a heartbeat, the room seems to hold its breath with him — his chest rising, eyes locked on yours like he’s afraid to look away and confirm something he already knows.

“Exactly,” he snaps at last, cold and sharp. “I want friendship. I want a best friend — not some dumbass in love with me.”

The words land harder than the shove that follows. His hands leave your hips, sudden and final, and the distance between you feels wider than the room itself.

Good. I’m fucking glad you’re not anymore. Makes things simpler.

Except it doesn’t.

You see it in the way his jaw tightens, in the way he won’t look at you when he turns to Jason instead. He slings an arm around him like armor, like proof.

“See?” Max says with a forced smirk, pulling Jason close. “All sorted. Best friends. No messy feelings.”

Jason laughs, easy and amused, his arm slipping around Max’s waist. Max presses into him deliberately, possessively — an intentional display. A message.

He’s straight.

He’s fine.

He’s not into you.

The silence that follows is unbearable.

When Max finally faces you again, his smile doesn’t reach his eyes. He holds out his fist, the same way he used to when you were kids — but now it feels like a dare.

“So… best friends?”

Your fist bumps his.

“Yeah,” you mumble. “Best friends.”

The contact is hollow. Max pulls back like it burned him.

Jason notices. He always does. He asks if you’re okay, drapes an arm around your shoulders, grounding you — and Max watches the whole thing like it’s a personal insult.

Then Max kisses Jason.

Right in front of you.

It’s messy and aggressive, all teeth and hands and heat, like he’s trying to prove something by force. His fingers dig into Jason’s hips, his mouth moving with a desperation that doesn’t match his words.

“So?” Max snaps when you call him out. “He’s a guy. I’m straight. What’s your point?”

“You’re my best friend,” you say, voice steady even though your chest aches. “You’re kissing my date. And you keep saying you’re not gay — but you’re making out with a man.”

“I’m not fucking gay!” he shouts. “I can kiss guys. I can fuck guys. That doesn’t make me gay!”

You stare at him. Then quietly:

“That’s… exactly why I’m gay, Max.”

The color drains from his face.

The argument slows after that — not louder, but heavier. Words turn into confessions neither of you meant to say out loud.

You tell him why you can’t stay single forever. Why loneliness gnaws at you. Why women don’t do anything for you — why your body has always known the truth before you had the language for it.

Max listens. Really listens.

And then, hesitantly, almost fearfully, he admits it.

He’s never wanted a woman.

Never gotten hard for one.

Never wanted to touch one — not really.

The realization hits him like vertigo.

“You’re saying I’m like you?” he whispers. “That I’m… gay?”

“If you’ve never wanted a girl,” you say gently, “then yeah. I’m saying you’re gay. Like me.”

He breaks.

Not loudly — but completely. His voice cracks. His hands shake. He backs away like the floor is shifting beneath him.

“I’m not,” he insists, but there’s no conviction left. “I’m not like you.”

Then, softer:

“I don’t know why my dick gets hard around you.”

That’s when the truth finally stops running.

He’s standing too close now, eyes wild, breath uneven — scared, furious, undone.

And for the first time, he isn’t pretending anymore.

Max doesn’t move right away.

His arm is still around your shoulders, but it’s different now—heavier, like he’s suddenly aware of every inch of contact between you. His jaw tightens, eyes fixed somewhere over your shoulder, not quite looking at you, not quite looking away either.

The room feels smaller.

“You’re still in love with me?” he asks quietly, like saying it louder might make it real in a way he’s not ready for.

You nod. It’s not dramatic. It’s not pretty. It’s just honest.

“Yeah,” you say. “I never stopped. I just… got tired of waiting for you to notice.”

That does it.

Max exhales sharply and finally lets his arm fall away, running a hand through his hair like he needs something to hold onto that isn’t you. He paces once, then stops, turning back with an expression you’ve never seen on him before—conflicted, stripped of all the easy confidence.

“Fuck,” he mutters. “I shouldn’t have said that shit about ‘no strings.’ I thought—” He cuts himself off, jaw working. “I thought you were over me. I thought it didn’t matter.”

You swallow. “It always mattered.”

Silence stretches between you, thick and fragile. When Max looks at you again, his voice is lower, steadier, but there’s something raw underneath it.

“You don’t get to say that and then let me pretend this is nothing,” he says. “Not anymore.”

He steps closer—not touching, not yet—close enough that you can feel the warmth of him, the hesitation, the restraint.

“I don’t know what I am,” he admits. “Or what this means. But I do know that if you’re still in love with me… I’m not walking away from that.”

His eyes search yours, serious now. No teasing. No denial.

“So if we do this,” he says softly, “it’s not a joke. And it’s not a distraction. It’s real.”

The air between you hums with everything that’s been unsaid for years.

And for the first time, Max isn’t running from it.

The fight burned itself out the way wildfires do—loud, destructive, and leaving silence that felt heavier than the noise ever had.

By the time Max came back upstairs, the house had settled into its nighttime hush. You’d eaten alone, watched something forgettable on the TV, tried not to replay every sharp word and half-finished sentence. When he sat on the couch without looking at you and said, flatly, that he hated you, the words didn’t land like anger. They landed like exhaustion.

You went to bed because there was nothing else to do.

Hours later, the door creaked open again. You were half-asleep when you felt the mattress dip, the careful weight of him sitting on the edge like he wasn’t sure he was allowed to be there. He stayed quiet so long you thought he might leave.

“Are you asleep?” he whispered.

“No,” you whispered back.

He didn’t look at you. His hands were clenched in his lap, knuckles pale. When he finally spoke, his voice cracked. He said he didn’t know why he’d said that. That he could never hate you. Not really. That the thought of hurting you sat wrong in his chest, like something broken that wouldn’t set.

You told him you knew. That it hurt—but you knew he didn’t mean it.

He asked, almost afraid of the answer, if you still wanted to be friends after all of it.

You said you’d never stop.

That was when he finally lay down beside you, not under the covers, just close enough to feel real. Like when you were kids and sleep was easier when someone you trusted was nearby. His hand found yours in the dark, tentative at first, then firm, fingers lacing together like muscle memory.

“I don’t know how to do any of this without you,” he whispered. “I’m sorry.”

You told him it was okay, even though you both knew it wasn’t really about forgiveness. It was about survival. About choosing to stay.

The silence between you softened after that. Not gone, but different. Less sharp. He shifted closer, the warmth of him seeping through fabric and familiarity. He told you he didn’t understand how you could be so patient with him. How you could stay kind when he was angry, confused, lashing out.

“You’re too good for me,” he said quietly.

You told him you’d been the asshole once too. That you didn’t want that for him. That you didn’t want him to have to be patient with someone who couldn’t meet him where he was.

His grip tightened, and you felt him swallow hard. “Don’t talk like that,” he said. “You’re not the same. You’re not—” He stopped, unable to finish the thought.

After a moment, he asked if you remembered the schoolyard. The day you stood up for him without thinking. The day you got punched in the face because someone bigger decided he was an easy target.

You remembered.

“You always show up for me,” he said. “You always have.”

In the dark, his thumb brushed over your knuckles, gentle and reverent, like he was afraid to break something fragile. And for the first time since the truth came out, neither of you tried to label what that meant.

You just stayed.

Max watched you with that familiar, unreadable look, his eyes never quite leaving yours. He let out a slow breath and shook his head.

“I know,” he said quietly. “And I’ve been a terrible friend lately.” His voice cracked just a little. “I don’t deserve someone like you.”

You brushed it off like you always did, promising it was fine.

He laughed shakily, eyes still wet. “You say that every time.” He leaned closer, his forehead nearly touching yours. “How are you even real?” The way he looked at you—like you were something fragile, something precious—said everything he couldn’t.

You laughed, denying it, and that only made him smile wider.

He reached out, gently messing up your hair the way he used to when you were kids. “Stop laughing,” he said, though his grin gave him away.

“Never,” you shot back.

That did it.

His eyes crinkled at the corners, and his voice dropped into that playful warning tone you knew all too well. “Oh, you’re gonna regret that. The tickler is coming.”

Before you could protest, his fingers were at your sides, and you burst into helpless laughter. He laughed with you, unrelenting, teasing you to say you’d stop. You gasped for air, tears of laughter streaking your face, until you finally gave in.

The moment you did, he stopped instantly, collapsing beside you with a grin. “Good,” he said smugly. “You were pathetic. Didn’t even last three seconds.”

You rolled your eyes, still catching your breath.

He laughed again, softer this time, then turned onto his side to face you. “You remember that time I snuck out to the arcade?” he asked. “When I broke curfew by two hours and my mom almost killed me?”

You chuckled and asked which time.

He groaned dramatically. “You know exactly which one. You told her I was at your place studying.” He poked your chest. “Liar.”

You shrugged, teasing. “I could’ve let you get your ass beat.”

He snorted. “Yeah, you totally could have.” His smile softened. “But you didn’t.”

And for a moment, lying there side by side, it felt like nothing had changed at all.

Max shrugs when you tease him, but his expression softens almost immediately.

“Yeah,” he admits, quieter now. “You totally could have left.”

Then he smiles — fond, unguarded — and reaches out, ruffling your hair like it’s second nature. Like touching you is something his body does before his mind can catch up.

“But you didn’t,” he adds. “You always had my back.”

A moment passes. His hand lingers, fingers still tangled in your hair, and he exhales sharply, like something in him is finally giving way.

“You know what?” he says, voice dropping. “You’re the only reason I didn’t get my ass kicked more often.” A crooked smile tugs at his mouth. “And the only reason I actually had friends growing up.”

You laugh it off, shake your head. Tell him that isn’t true. Tell him he was always cool enough to make friends without you.

“Bullshit.”

The word is firm, final. Max looks at you now — really looks — brows drawn together, eyes intense.

“I was a weird kid. Too quiet. Too angry.” His jaw tightens. “Nobody wanted to hang out with the pissed-off kid with the fucked-up family.”

Then, softer: “You were the first person who actually liked being around me. Everyone else just… followed your lead.”

You tell him he was just misunderstood. That you only helped people see what was already there.

His expression eases. He smiles, something warm and genuine in his eyes as he squeezes your shoulder.

“Maybe,” he says. “But you made it easier for them to see who I really was. Under all the anger. All the sadness.”

Later, when you ask if he ever figured out what he was feeling earlier, he sits up suddenly, running a hand through his hair with a frustrated sigh.

“Fuck if I know,” he mutters. “I was just… really happy. Like, genuinely happy. And it felt weird.”

He leans forward, elbows on his knees, staring at the floor.

“It was like everything finally felt right,” he says quietly. “Like I could breathe.”

He glances at you — just for a second — then looks away again, almost shy.

“Does that make any sense?”

Your heart is pounding when you ask it. Barely louder than a whisper.

“Can I… can I kiss you?”

His head snaps up. His eyes go wide. For a long moment, he just stares at you, stunned, trying to process what you said. His breath catches.

“What?” he whispers.

But the moment slips past.

Instead, he smiles at you — affectionate, familiar — thumb brushing your shoulder in a way that feels painfully gentle. Completely unaware of how much you love him.

Unaware of how badly it hurts.

He leans back, hands laced behind his head, staring at the ceiling.

“I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t around,” he says with a soft chuckle. “You’re stuck with me, you know. Best friends ’til one of us dies.”

He grins.

And you smile back, chest aching, holding everything you never say.

He asked it casually at first, like it didn’t matter.

Like he wasn’t bracing himself for the answer.

Had you figured out how you were feeling earlier?

Max sat up suddenly, dragging a hand through his hair with a frustrated sigh. He looked restless, unsettled—nothing like his usual easy confidence.

“Fuck if I know,” he muttered. His brows pulled together as he looked at you. “I was just… really fucking happy. Like genuinely happy. And it felt weird.”

You listened quietly as his voice dropped, softer now, more vulnerable.

“It was like everything just felt right,” he said, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, staring at the floor. “Like I could finally breathe.”

He glanced at you, just for a second, then looked away again, almost shy.

“Does that make any sense?”

Your heart was pounding before you even realized you’d decided to say it.

“Can I… can I kiss you?”

His head snapped up. His eyes widened, shock flashing across his face as he stared at you, frozen. For a moment, he didn’t say anything—just searched your expression, like he was trying to figure out if you were serious.

“What?” he whispered, barely audible.

You started to apologize immediately, words tumbling over each other, but he lifted a hand, stopping you mid-sentence. He leaned closer, his gaze intense enough to make your breath hitch.

“No,” he said quietly. “Don’t take it back.”

Then he closed the distance.

You kissed him slowly, deliberately, like you were afraid the moment might disappear if you rushed it. His response was instant—just as slow, just as deep. A soft sound slipped from his throat, something caught between surprise and relief, as his hands slid from your face into your hair, fingers threading through gently, reverently.

When he finally pulled back, his lips still hovered close to yours, his breathing uneven.

“Holy shit,” he breathed, his forehead nearly touching yours. “Why does that feel… why does that feel so fucking good?”

His grip tightened slightly, like he was afraid you might vanish.

The words slipped out before either of you could stop them.

“Maybe deep down you’re in love with me too.”

He stared at you like the ground had shifted beneath his feet—shock, confusion, and then something like realization washing over his expression. He searched your face for any hint of a joke and found none.

“Shut the fuck up,” he said, a hesitant smile tugging at his lips.

You laughed softly, nervous.

He exhaled shakily. “I didn’t—” He stopped, collecting himself. “I didn’t let myself think about it. I was too scared.”

His hand came up again, thumb brushing your cheek.

“But yeah,” he admitted quietly. “Fuck. Yeah. I think I am.”

Relief flooded through you.

“Thank God.”

He grinned, wide and unguarded, pulling you into another kiss—faster this time, messier, just as full of feeling.

“I’ve been in love with you for so long, you idiot,” he murmured against your lips. “So fucking long.”

You smiled into the kiss.

“Me too, Max. Me too.”

Five years later. 

Snow fell softly over Paris, catching in Max’s lashes as he leaned closer beneath the glow of the Eiffel Tower. The city shimmered around you — golden lights, distant laughter, the hum of life moving on — but for a moment, it felt like the world had narrowed down to just the two of you.

Five years together. Five years of love, fear, laughter, and finally choosing each other.

Max laced his fingers through yours, his breath misting in the cold. “Five years,” he murmured, a soft grin tugging at his lips. “And you still look at me like I’m the one who’s perfect.”

You swallowed, your heart pounding. The snowflakes blurred as emotion filled your chest.

“Because you are,” you said quietly. “Because you’re the only one who’s ever truly understood me. The only one I’ve ever loved.”

You stepped back.

Then you dropped to one knee.

Max froze.

The ring box felt warm in your hand despite the winter air. Around you, snow swirled like something out of a dream.

“So, Max,” you said, voice shaking just enough to betray how much this meant. “Will you marry me?”

For a heartbeat, he just stared.

Then his eyes filled with tears.

“Are you fucking serious right now?” he whispered, voice cracking.

You laughed softly. “Yeah. I am.”

He let out a broken sob of a laugh and dropped to his knees in the snow in front of you, not caring that his pants were soaking through. He cupped your face like he was afraid you might disappear.

“Yes,” he said. “Yes, I will.”

You stood and pulled him into your arms, kissing him like the world might end tomorrow. You spun him in the falling snow, laughing, breathless, dizzy with happiness.

“You asshole,” he laughed against your lips. “You waited five years just to propose under the Eiffel Tower? You’re so extra.”

You pressed your forehead to his. “I wanted it to be as perfect as you.”

He kissed you again, slow and full of promise, while Paris watched and the snow kept falling — the beginning of forever written into the night.

Two years later. 

we’re standing at the altar with the ocean roaring behind us, salt in the air and sunlight catching on every happy tear. The words man and man have barely finished echoing before we’re kissing—like we’ve waited our whole lives for permission to breathe. Friends and family blur into the background. Nothing exists but him, his hands trembling against my face, the way he laughs softly into the kiss as if joy alone might undo him.

“Forever sounds fucking perfect,” Max says, wiping at his eyes and smiling like he can’t believe this is real. He looks out at everyone we love, then back at me, and I know—this is it. This is home.

Years pass the way gentle waves do—steady, constant, full of meaning.

Five years later, we stand in our backyard, hands intertwined, watching our children chase each other through the grass. Two beautiful souls. One has my dark hair, the other Max’s bright, unmistakable eyes. Their laughter fills the space between us, proof of every choice we made, every fight we survived, every promise we kept.

Max slips an arm around my waist and pulls me closer, pressing a soft kiss to my temple. Time has only made him more himself—more kind, more handsome, more everything. When I squeeze his hand and lift it to my lips, I murmur the words we’ve never stopped saying.

“Till death do us part.”

His thumb brushes over my knuckles, warm and familiar. He looks at me the same way he did years ago, back when we were younger and standing beneath the Eiffel Tower, hearts racing with the terror and thrill of first love.

“And even after death,” he says quietly.

1qfvxa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1qfvxa1/m36_looking_for_best_good_friend/,"M36, looking for best/ good friend","Hey everyone. I’m male, 36 years old, and I’m looking for a good/best female friend. I’ve read posts like this in various groups and thought I’d give it a try. I want to be able to talk to this person about absolutely everything and know that it stays with them, that they won’t judge me for anything, but will simply be there for me. I really mean everything, no matter what.

I’m someone you can do anything with, who’s always there for you and stands by you no matter what happens. The kind of person who would drive 1,000 km in the middle of the night to pick you up from another country without thinking twice, and with whom every secret stays a secret.

It should be a woman, simply because I have no desire to talk about certain things with men, and because women just have a different perspective on things — usually a smarter one, probably. If you meet up for a coffee in the afternoon and feel like talking about last night, a gangbang, or God knows what, then that’s just how it is.

Of course, that assumes you’re not quite right in the head anymore — but who wants to be normal anyway.",1,1768702153.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.67,False

(un shortened version.),"Max leans back against the weight bench, arms crossed, a lazy grin on his face as he talks about the girl from his class. Lily. Pretty, smart, funny. He says her name like it’s nothing, like it doesn’t settle heavy in your chest.

“You know what?” he adds, glancing down at you. “I think I might ask her out this weekend.”

“No—don’t,” you say before you can stop yourself.

He blinks, clearly caught off guard. “Whoa. Okay.” He lets out a nervous laugh, scratching the back of his neck. “Didn’t realize you had such strong feelings about my dating life.” His eyes narrow slightly. “You look… jealous.”

You shake your head too fast. “No. It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”

Max studies you the way he always has, like he’s reading between the lines you never say out loud. He steps closer, blocking your escape. “Dude, you’re a terrible liar. Always have been. What’s going on?”

“I said it’s nothing.”

He scoffs. “Nothing my ass.” His voice drops, serious now. “You never get this worked up. Especially not over who I date.”

“Quit pushing,” you snap quietly. “Before I say something I can’t take back.”

That finally makes him back off—but only for a second. Frustration flashes across his face. “Fine. Keep your secrets.” He turns away, muttering under his breath, then stops. “But if you’re gonna be a moody bitch about who I date, maybe I should—”

“I’m sorry.”

He freezes and looks back at you. “You’re… sorry?” He steps closer, his tone softer now. “You’re sorry for being jealous over some girl I haven’t even asked out yet?”

You swallow. “I’m sorry for letting my feelings get in the way of your happiness.”

The words hang between you like a dropped weight.

Max stares at you, shock draining the color from his face. “Wait. Did you just say… feelings?” He sits down beside you slowly. “Like—real feelings?”

“Forget it,” you mutter, already trying to stand.

He grabs your arm, firm but not rough. “Nope. Sit.” He pulls you back down, turning to face you fully, his knee brushing yours. “You don’t get to drop a bomb like that and run.”

“It’s better for our friendship if I don’t say anything.”

His grip tightens. “Better for our friendship—or better for hiding whatever the hell is going on in your head?” His voice lowers. “We’ve been best friends forever.”

You sigh. “I know.”

He exhales slowly, running a hand through his hair. “I know I’m not great with feelings. But I know you. Better than anyone.” He looks at you. “Tell me.”

You hesitate, heart pounding, then finally whisper, “I’m gay. And I’m in love with you.”

For a moment, Max doesn’t move.

Then he stands abruptly, pacing back and forth. “Holy shit,” he mutters. “Holy fucking shit.” He drags his hands through his hair. “My best friend is in love with me. And he’s gay.”

He stops and takes a breath before sitting back down, leaving a small space between you. “Okay. Okay. I just… need a minute.”

“I’m sorry—”

“No,” he cuts in immediately. “Don’t apologize.” He shakes his head. “I had no clue.”

“You weren’t supposed to.”

He looks at you carefully. “When did this start?”

“Since sophomore year.”

His jaw drops. “Three years?” He looks down at his hands. “That explains a lot.” Then back at you. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

“You’re straight,” you say quietly. “I didn’t want to lose you.”

His expression hardens—not with anger, but disbelief. “You really thought I’d abandon you?”

“Yes.”

He snaps back, hurt flashing in his eyes. “After everything we’ve been through? You thought I’d drop you because you’re gay and in love with me?”

“That’s usually what happens.”

“That’s not how we work,” he says firmly. “I’m not that guy.”

Silence stretches between you.

Finally, he rubs his temples and exhales. “I thought we were just… us. Two guys being best friends.” He swallows. “Did that mean all the hugs—”

“No,” you say quickly. “Don’t overthink it.”

He lets out a humorless laugh. “How the hell am I supposed to not overthink this?”

“I’m sorry.”

He reaches out, gripping your shoulder. “Stop apologizing. I’m not mad at you. I’m mad you thought you had to hide this from me.” He softens. “I’m your best friend.”

“I know.”

He leans back again. “This is going to take time to process.” He looks at you seriously. “I need to ask you something. Be honest.”

You nod.

“Do you still have feelings for me?”

Your throat tightens. You try to speak, but nothing comes out.

He gently lifts your chin so you have to look at him. “Answer me.”

“Yes.”

He nods slowly. “Okay.” He exhales. “So for three years, you’ve been in love with your straight best friend.”

“Yeah.”

He gives a quiet, almost sad laugh. “That’s a shitty hand to be dealt.”

Then he grows serious. “I’m not going to lie and say this doesn’t change things. Because it does.”

You nod, bracing yourself.

Max doesn’t answer right away.

He just stares at you, jaw tight, eyes searching your face like he’s trying to memorize something before it disappears. The room feels too quiet, too charged.

“So… that’s it?” he finally asks. “You’re just… free now?”

You shrug, trying to keep it light even though your chest aches. “Yeah. I mean, now that you know, I don’t have to keep pretending. I can date. I don’t have to feel guilty about it.”

He nods, slow and careful, like he’s stepping through a minefield. “Yeah. That makes sense.” Then, softer, almost strained: “You gonna start dating now?”

“Maybe,” you say. “I’ve got nothing holding me back anymore.”

Something flickers across his face—something sharp and unreadable. “Anyone in mind?”

“There’s a guy from high school,” you say. “He texted me earlier. Wanted to go out.”

Max scoffs. “Who? Not Jake from the football team.”

“Jason,” you correct. “He wasn’t that bad.”

Max’s jaw tightens. “He was an asshole. He used to flirt with you right in front of me.”

You shrug again. “Probably gonna go out with him.”

The word probably lands like a punch.

“You’re—” He stops himself, swallows. “You’re really gonna date him?”

“If I like him,” you say slowly, confused by the edge in his voice. “Yeah.”

Max snaps, “You’d just be his boyfriend? Just like that?”

You blink. “Why are you acting weird?”

“I’m not,” he lies badly, dragging a hand through his hair. “Forget it. Do whatever you want.”

The anger drains out of him almost as fast as it came, leaving guilt behind. “I’m sorry,” he mutters. “I didn’t mean— just… forget it.”

Later that night, your phone buzzes.

What are you wearing?

You tell him. Dark purple button-up. Jeans. Cowboy boots.

There’s a pause before he replies.

Sounds like you’re trying to get laid.

You laugh it off, thumbs flying. Maybe if I’m lucky.

His response comes faster than it should.

In your fucking dreams, pretty boy.

Your heart stutters.

You tell yourself it doesn’t mean anything. That you’re just friends. That Jason probably calls everyone that.

But Max doesn’t like that thought. You can feel it bleeding through his words, turning bitter, sharp.

By the time you leave for the bar, the air between you feels stretched thin, ready to snap.

Hours pass.

Max checks his phone again. And again.

2:17 AM.

2:41 AM.

3:02 AM.

Nothing.

Worst-case scenarios start crawling through his head until he can’t take it anymore. He calls.

“Hello?” you whisper, voice low and sleepy.

Relief crashes into him so hard his knees almost give. Then irritation follows close behind.

“Where the fuck are you?” he whispers back. “And why are you whispering?”

That’s when he realizes it.

This isn’t jealousy anymore.

This isn’t protectiveness.

This is fear.

And maybe—

something else he’s been refusing to name.

Max didn’t sleep.

He lay on his back staring at the ceiling, phone discarded somewhere on the floor where he’d thrown it hours ago, jaw clenched so tightly it hurt. Every time he closed his eyes, the same images replayed uninvited—your laugh, Jason’s hands, the way you’d whispered so carefully so you wouldn’t wake him.

Jason’s still asleep. I don’t want to wake him.

Max hated how small that sentence made him feel.

He told himself he had no right to this jealousy. You were his best friend. Jason was just… Jason. A guy you met at a bar. A guy whose bed you were apparently still in. The fact that Max could imagine it so vividly—rumpled sheets, discarded clothes, your body tucked comfortably against someone who wasn’t him—made his chest ache.

By morning, it hadn’t gotten better.

Scrolling aimlessly through his phone, Max froze when Jason’s post popped up. A messy bed. Clothes scattered. A caption that might as well have been a knife: Last night was 🔥🔥. Morning coffee anyone?

Max’s stomach dropped.

He texted you before he could stop himself, the words sharp and ugly and fueled by jealousy he didn’t know how to swallow. Your replies didn’t help—casual, teasing, happy. You told him about eggs and bacon, about breakfast and showers and plans together, like this was all normal now. Like Jason was normal.

Like this was normal.

“You sound happy,” he typed eventually, hating how bitter it came out.

You didn’t hesitate.

I am. I really am.

That hurt more than anything else.

When Max told you he was coming over, he regretted it instantly—and then doubled down anyway. He needed to see you. Needed to know you were real and not just a loop of imagined moments torturing him from his bed.

Twenty minutes later, he walked into your place without knocking.

You were on the couch with Jason, close in that effortless way Max had never seen before. Jason’s hand rested casually around your ankle. You both looked up when Max entered, like this was normal too. Like Max hadn’t just driven over with his heart in his throat.

He sat where Jason had been when Jason went to the kitchen, the scent of his cologne still lingering on the cushion. It made Max’s jaw tighten.

“So,” he asked quietly, “are you guys… official?”

“Not yet,” you said.

Relief and jealousy tangled in his chest, neither winning.

Jason came back with brownies, draped an arm around your shoulders like it belonged there. You leaned into it without thinking, smiling as you talked about how amazing he was in the kitchen. Max stared at the TV, forcing himself to chew, to swallow, to breathe.

You were glowing.

Not the version of you Max knew—the sarcastic, chill, late-night-talk version—but something softer. Happier. Someone who laughed easily, who leaned into affection instead of deflecting it.

And Max realized, with a sharp, painful clarity, that he’d never been the one who made you like this.

That’s when it hit him.

He was losing you.

“I should probably get going,” he said suddenly, standing too fast.

You and Jason spoke at the same time. “Are you sure?”

That made it worse somehow—how natural it sounded, the two of you together.

Max forced a tight smile, nodded, and headed for the door before you could see the way his chest felt like it was splitting open.

Because wanting you when you were this happy—just not with him—was the cruelest thing he’d ever felt.

The door closed harder than it needed to.

Max didn’t look back as he left, but the sound echoed through the room anyway, sharp and final. For a moment, the silence felt louder than the slam itself.

Jason watched the door, brow furrowing, then turned back to you and pulled you closer with an easy familiarity. “You okay?” he asked, pressing a quick kiss to your temple. “He seemed… weird.”

You shrugged, though the feeling in your chest hadn’t settled. “Yeah. I don’t know what’s going on with him lately.”

Jason hummed, unconcerned. “Probably work.” His hands were already warm and grounding, tracing absent-minded circles as if nothing had shifted at all. Outside, unseen, Max sat in his car, hands locked around the steering wheel, knuckles white as he stared at the house like it might break him if he looked too long.

Inside, you laughed softly at something Jason said, and that was enough to make Max finally tear his eyes away.

He didn’t leave.

Instead, he came back.

The door slammed again—this time close enough to rattle the walls.

You jumped upright. “Max!”

He stopped mid-step, chest heaving, eyes flicking from your face to Jason’s. Jason barely moved, lounging like he belonged there, like Max was the one intruding.

“Get your hands off him,” Max said, voice rough, stripped of humor.

Jason raised his hands slowly, mockingly. “Whoa. Easy.” A smirk tugged at his mouth. “What’s this about—jealousy?”

“Guys, please,” you said quickly, stepping between them. “This is getting insane.”

Jason laughed under his breath, eyes never leaving Max. “Relax. He’s mine. You’ll get used to it.”

The words landed wrong. You felt it immediately.

“Jason,” you snapped, “Max is my best friend. And he’s straight. You’re being an ass.”

Max took a step back like he’d been slapped. “What the hell?” he said, looking genuinely shaken. “I’m not— I would never— I’m straight.”

“I know,” you said firmly. “He’s confused.”

“Confused about what?” Max shot back, color rising in his face. “That I don’t like guys? That I care about my best friend?”

Jason rolled his eyes. “Whatever. He’s acting like he wants to punch me every time I touch you.”

You pulled away then, putting distance between all three of you. “I’m not doing this. You two need to figure it out. I’m not the referee.”

The tension spiked instantly.

Max looked relieved—and furious. Jason looked annoyed—and challenged.

“Talk it out,” you ordered. “Now.”

Max took a breath, hands curling into fists at his sides. “I’m not jealous,” he said through clenched teeth. “I’m pissed that you think you can talk about him like he’s something you own.”

Jason pushed off the wall, smile sharp. “And I’m saying I care about him. He makes me happy. That’s it.”

For a long moment, no one spoke.

The room felt like it was holding its breath.

Max’s jaw tightened, arms folding across his chest as he tried—failed—to calm himself. “Then start acting like it,” he said quietly. “Because right now, you’re treating him like a trophy.”

Jason hesitated. Just for a second.

And in that pause, everything changed.

The fight wasn’t about jealousy.

It wasn’t about labels.

It was about love—spoken, unspoken, and dangerously close to spilling over.

Max’s arms are crossed tight over his chest, jaw locked so hard it aches.

“I get that you like him,” he says, voice rough. “I get that you’re happy with him. But stop acting like he’s yours to control. He’s my best friend. He always will be.”

Jason exhales slowly, running a hand through his hair. He steps closer, close enough to crowd Max’s space without quite touching him.

“He is mine,” Jason says calmly. “In private, he’s with me. Outside of that, he’s your best friend. You’ll deal with it.”

Something in Max snaps.

“So what—” His hands fly up, frustration spilling over. “I’m just supposed to sit back and watch you have him? Pretend it doesn’t tear me apart?”

Jason’s expression sharpens, interest flickering behind his eyes.

“Is that what this is?” he asks. “You want him?”

Silence answers for Max. His face burns, anger and embarrassment warring in his chest.

“I—I didn’t mean it like that,” Max mutters. “I just want him around. That’s all.”

Jason laughs quietly. Not kindly.

“Bullshit.”

He steps in closer, voice dropping.

“You don’t look at someone like that if you don’t want them.”

Max’s breath stutters. He hates how Jason can see straight through him—how the words drag feelings to the surface he’s spent years burying.

“Shut up,” Max whispers hoarsely. “Just—shut up.”

Jason only smirks.

“You’re not angry. You’re jealous.”

“I’m not,” Max snaps. “I’m straight.”

Jason gestures between them, between Max and you, still caught in the middle of it all.

“Then explain why you’re standing here like this.”

Max’s hands tighten at your waist before he even realizes he’s moved. The contact is instinctive—protective, desperate. His face flushes crimson as he realizes what he’s done.

Jason’s voice softens, but it cuts deeper.

“He’s wanted you for years,” he says quietly. “Since the day he met you.”

“That’s not true,” you say, heart hammering. “He knows I loved him.”

Max goes completely still.

“You remember that?” he asks, voice barely holding together.

Of course you do. Sophomore year. Too much cheap wine. Tears in your eyes. His hands warm and careful on your back as he promised nothing would change.

We can still be best friends.

“Every word,” you say.

Max closes his eyes like it hurts to hear it aloud.

“I meant it,” he whispers. “I really thought I could live with that.”

“Exactly,” you say softly. “That’s what we are. Best friends.”

Something breaks in him.

“Exactly,” Max snaps, eyes shining. “That’s all we are.”

The words come out like an accusation—like a wound he’s been pressing on for years.

“That’s all you want,” he says bitterly. “Just friends.”

“No,” you say sharply. “That’s all you wanted.”

Max freezes.

The room goes quiet. Even Jason stops smiling.

And for the first time, Max has no denial left to hide behind.

Max freezes the moment you say it.

For a heartbeat, the room seems to hold its breath with him — his chest rising, eyes locked on yours like he’s afraid to look away and confirm something he already knows.

“Exactly,” he snaps at last, cold and sharp. “I want friendship. I want a best friend — not some dumbass in love with me.”

The words land harder than the shove that follows. His hands leave your hips, sudden and final, and the distance between you feels wider than the room itself.

Good. I’m fucking glad you’re not anymore. Makes things simpler.

Except it doesn’t.

You see it in the way his jaw tightens, in the way he won’t look at you when he turns to Jason instead. He slings an arm around him like armor, like proof.

“See?” Max says with a forced smirk, pulling Jason close. “All sorted. Best friends. No messy feelings.”

Jason laughs, easy and amused, his arm slipping around Max’s waist. Max presses into him deliberately, possessively — an intentional display. A message.

He’s straight.

He’s fine.

He’s not into you.

The silence that follows is unbearable.

When Max finally faces you again, his smile doesn’t reach his eyes. He holds out his fist, the same way he used to when you were kids — but now it feels like a dare.

“So… best friends?”

Your fist bumps his.

“Yeah,” you mumble. “Best friends.”

The contact is hollow. Max pulls back like it burned him.

Jason notices. He always does. He asks if you’re okay, drapes an arm around your shoulders, grounding you — and Max watches the whole thing like it’s a personal insult.

Then Max kisses Jason.

Right in front of you.

It’s messy and aggressive, all teeth and hands and heat, like he’s trying to prove something by force. His fingers dig into Jason’s hips, his mouth moving with a desperation that doesn’t match his words.

“So?” Max snaps when you call him out. “He’s a guy. I’m straight. What’s your point?”

“You’re my best friend,” you say, voice steady even though your chest aches. “You’re kissing my date. And you keep saying you’re not gay — but you’re making out with a man.”

“I’m not fucking gay!” he shouts. “I can kiss guys. I can fuck guys. That doesn’t make me gay!”

You stare at him. Then quietly:

“That’s… exactly why I’m gay, Max.”

The color drains from his face.

The argument slows after that — not louder, but heavier. Words turn into confessions neither of you meant to say out loud.

You tell him why you can’t stay single forever. Why loneliness gnaws at you. Why women don’t do anything for you — why your body has always known the truth before you had the language for it.

Max listens. Really listens.

And then, hesitantly, almost fearfully, he admits it.

He’s never wanted a woman.

Never gotten hard for one.

Never wanted to touch one — not really.

The realization hits him like vertigo.

“You’re saying I’m like you?” he whispers. “That I’m… gay?”

“If you’ve never wanted a girl,” you say gently, “then yeah. I’m saying you’re gay. Like me.”

He breaks.

Not loudly — but completely. His voice cracks. His hands shake. He backs away like the floor is shifting beneath him.

“I’m not,” he insists, but there’s no conviction left. “I’m not like you.”

Then, softer:

“I don’t know why my dick gets hard around you.”

That’s when the truth finally stops running.

He’s standing too close now, eyes wild, breath uneven — scared, furious, undone.

And for the first time, he isn’t pretending anymore.

Max doesn’t move right away.

His arm is still around your shoulders, but it’s different now—heavier, like he’s suddenly aware of every inch of contact between you. His jaw tightens, eyes fixed somewhere over your shoulder, not quite looking at you, not quite looking away either.

The room feels smaller.

“You’re still in love with me?” he asks quietly, like saying it louder might make it real in a way he’s not ready for.

You nod. It’s not dramatic. It’s not pretty. It’s just honest.

“Yeah,” you say. “I never stopped. I just… got tired of waiting for you to notice.”

That does it.

Max exhales sharply and finally lets his arm fall away, running a hand through his hair like he needs something to hold onto that isn’t you. He paces once, then stops, turning back with an expression you’ve never seen on him before—conflicted, stripped of all the easy confidence.

“Fuck,” he mutters. “I shouldn’t have said that shit about ‘no strings.’ I thought—” He cuts himself off, jaw working. “I thought you were over me. I thought it didn’t matter.”

You swallow. “It always mattered.”

Silence stretches between you, thick and fragile. When Max looks at you again, his voice is lower, steadier, but there’s something raw underneath it.

“You don’t get to say that and then let me pretend this is nothing,” he says. “Not anymore.”

He steps closer—not touching, not yet—close enough that you can feel the warmth of him, the hesitation, the restraint.

“I don’t know what I am,” he admits. “Or what this means. But I do know that if you’re still in love with me… I’m not walking away from that.”

His eyes search yours, serious now. No teasing. No denial.

“So if we do this,” he says softly, “it’s not a joke. And it’s not a distraction. It’s real.”

The air between you hums with everything that’s been unsaid for years.

And for the first time, Max isn’t running from it.

The fight burned itself out the way wildfires do—loud, destructive, and leaving silence that felt heavier than the noise ever had.

By the time Max came back upstairs, the house had settled into its nighttime hush. You’d eaten alone, watched something forgettable on the TV, tried not to replay every sharp word and half-finished sentence. When he sat on the couch without looking at you and said, flatly, that he hated you, the words didn’t land like anger. They landed like exhaustion.

You went to bed because there was nothing else to do.

Hours later, the door creaked open again. You were half-asleep when you felt the mattress dip, the careful weight of him sitting on the edge like he wasn’t sure he was allowed to be there. He stayed quiet so long you thought he might leave.

“Are you asleep?” he whispered.

“No,” you whispered back.

He didn’t look at you. His hands were clenched in his lap, knuckles pale. When he finally spoke, his voice cracked. He said he didn’t know why he’d said that. That he could never hate you. Not really. That the thought of hurting you sat wrong in his chest, like something broken that wouldn’t set.

You told him you knew. That it hurt—but you knew he didn’t mean it.

He asked, almost afraid of the answer, if you still wanted to be friends after all of it.

You said you’d never stop.

That was when he finally lay down beside you, not under the covers, just close enough to feel real. Like when you were kids and sleep was easier when someone you trusted was nearby. His hand found yours in the dark, tentative at first, then firm, fingers lacing together like muscle memory.

“I don’t know how to do any of this without you,” he whispered. “I’m sorry.”

You told him it was okay, even though you both knew it wasn’t really about forgiveness. It was about survival. About choosing to stay.

The silence between you softened after that. Not gone, but different. Less sharp. He shifted closer, the warmth of him seeping through fabric and familiarity. He told you he didn’t understand how you could be so patient with him. How you could stay kind when he was angry, confused, lashing out.

“You’re too good for me,” he said quietly.

You told him you’d been the asshole once too. That you didn’t want that for him. That you didn’t want him to have to be patient with someone who couldn’t meet him where he was.

His grip tightened, and you felt him swallow hard. “Don’t talk like that,” he said. “You’re not the same. You’re not—” He stopped, unable to finish the thought.

After a moment, he asked if you remembered the schoolyard. The day you stood up for him without thinking. The day you got punched in the face because someone bigger decided he was an easy target.

You remembered.

“You always show up for me,” he said. “You always have.”

In the dark, his thumb brushed over your knuckles, gentle and reverent, like he was afraid to break something fragile. And for the first time since the truth came out, neither of you tried to label what that meant.

You just stayed.

Max watched you with that familiar, unreadable look, his eyes never quite leaving yours. He let out a slow breath and shook his head.

“I know,” he said quietly. “And I’ve been a terrible friend lately.” His voice cracked just a little. “I don’t deserve someone like you.”

You brushed it off like you always did, promising it was fine.

He laughed shakily, eyes still wet. “You say that every time.” He leaned closer, his forehead nearly touching yours. “How are you even real?” The way he looked at you—like you were something fragile, something precious—said everything he couldn’t.

You laughed, denying it, and that only made him smile wider.

He reached out, gently messing up your hair the way he used to when you were kids. “Stop laughing,” he said, though his grin gave him away.

“Never,” you shot back.

That did it.

His eyes crinkled at the corners, and his voice dropped into that playful warning tone you knew all too well. “Oh, you’re gonna regret that. The tickler is coming.”

Before you could protest, his fingers were at your sides, and you burst into helpless laughter. He laughed with you, unrelenting, teasing you to say you’d stop. You gasped for air, tears of laughter streaking your face, until you finally gave in.

The moment you did, he stopped instantly, collapsing beside you with a grin. “Good,” he said smugly. “You were pathetic. Didn’t even last three seconds.”

You rolled your eyes, still catching your breath.

He laughed again, softer this time, then turned onto his side to face you. “You remember that time I snuck out to the arcade?” he asked. “When I broke curfew by two hours and my mom almost killed me?”

You chuckled and asked which time.

He groaned dramatically. “You know exactly which one. You told her I was at your place studying.” He poked your chest. “Liar.”

You shrugged, teasing. “I could’ve let you get your ass beat.”

He snorted. “Yeah, you totally could have.” His smile softened. “But you didn’t.”

And for a moment, lying there side by side, it felt like nothing had changed at all.

Max shrugs when you tease him, but his expression softens almost immediately.

“Yeah,” he admits, quieter now. “You totally could have left.”

Then he smiles — fond, unguarded — and reaches out, ruffling your hair like it’s second nature. Like touching you is something his body does before his mind can catch up.

“But you didn’t,” he adds. “You always had my back.”

A moment passes. His hand lingers, fingers still tangled in your hair, and he exhales sharply, like something in him is finally giving way.

“You know what?” he says, voice dropping. “You’re the only reason I didn’t get my ass kicked more often.” A crooked smile tugs at his mouth. “And the only reason I actually had friends growing up.”

You laugh it off, shake your head. Tell him that isn’t true. Tell him he was always cool enough to make friends without you.

“Bullshit.”

The word is firm, final. Max looks at you now — really looks — brows drawn together, eyes intense.

“I was a weird kid. Too quiet. Too angry.” His jaw tightens. “Nobody wanted to hang out with the pissed-off kid with the fucked-up family.”

Then, softer: “You were the first person who actually liked being around me. Everyone else just… followed your lead.”

You tell him he was just misunderstood. That you only helped people see what was already there.

His expression eases. He smiles, something warm and genuine in his eyes as he squeezes your shoulder.

“Maybe,” he says. “But you made it easier for them to see who I really was. Under all the anger. All the sadness.”

Later, when you ask if he ever figured out what he was feeling earlier, he sits up suddenly, running a hand through his hair with a frustrated sigh.

“Fuck if I know,” he mutters. “I was just… really happy. Like, genuinely happy. And it felt weird.”

He leans forward, elbows on his knees, staring at the floor.

“It was like everything finally felt right,” he says quietly. “Like I could breathe.”

He glances at you — just for a second — then looks away again, almost shy.

“Does that make any sense?”

Your heart is pounding when you ask it. Barely louder than a whisper.

“Can I… can I kiss you?”

His head snaps up. His eyes go wide. For a long moment, he just stares at you, stunned, trying to process what you said. His breath catches.

“What?” he whispers.

But the moment slips past.

Instead, he smiles at you — affectionate, familiar — thumb brushing your shoulder in a way that feels painfully gentle. Completely unaware of how much you love him.

Unaware of how badly it hurts.

He leans back, hands laced behind his head, staring at the ceiling.

“I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t around,” he says with a soft chuckle. “You’re stuck with me, you know. Best friends ’til one of us dies.”

He grins.

And you smile back, chest aching, holding everything you never say.

He asked it casually at first, like it didn’t matter.

Like he wasn’t bracing himself for the answer.

Had you figured out how you were feeling earlier?

Max sat up suddenly, dragging a hand through his hair with a frustrated sigh. He looked restless, unsettled—nothing like his usual easy confidence.

“Fuck if I know,” he muttered. His brows pulled together as he looked at you. “I was just… really fucking happy. Like genuinely happy. And it felt weird.”

You listened quietly as his voice dropped, softer now, more vulnerable.

“It was like everything just felt right,” he said, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, staring at the floor. “Like I could finally breathe.”

He glanced at you, just for a second, then looked away again, almost shy.

“Does that make any sense?”

Your heart was pounding before you even realized you’d decided to say it.

“Can I… can I kiss you?”

His head snapped up. His eyes widened, shock flashing across his face as he stared at you, frozen. For a moment, he didn’t say anything—just searched your expression, like he was trying to figure out if you were serious.

“What?” he whispered, barely audible.

You started to apologize immediately, words tumbling over each other, but he lifted a hand, stopping you mid-sentence. He leaned closer, his gaze intense enough to make your breath hitch.

“No,” he said quietly. “Don’t take it back.”

Then he closed the distance.

You kissed him slowly, deliberately, like you were afraid the moment might disappear if you rushed it. His response was instant—just as slow, just as deep. A soft sound slipped from his throat, something caught between surprise and relief, as his hands slid from your face into your hair, fingers threading through gently, reverently.

When he finally pulled back, his lips still hovered close to yours, his breathing uneven.

“Holy shit,” he breathed, his forehead nearly touching yours. “Why does that feel… why does that feel so fucking good?”

His grip tightened slightly, like he was afraid you might vanish.

The words slipped out before either of you could stop them.

“Maybe deep down you’re in love with me too.”

He stared at you like the ground had shifted beneath his feet—shock, confusion, and then something like realization washing over his expression. He searched your face for any hint of a joke and found none.

“Shut the fuck up,” he said, a hesitant smile tugging at his lips.

You laughed softly, nervous.

He exhaled shakily. “I didn’t—” He stopped, collecting himself. “I didn’t let myself think about it. I was too scared.”

His hand came up again, thumb brushing your cheek.

“But yeah,” he admitted quietly. “Fuck. Yeah. I think I am.”

Relief flooded through you.

“Thank God.”

He grinned, wide and unguarded, pulling you into another kiss—faster this time, messier, just as full of feeling.

“I’ve been in love with you for so long, you idiot,” he murmured against your lips. “So fucking long.”

You smiled into the kiss.

“Me too, Max. Me too.”

Five years later. 

Snow fell softly over Paris, catching in Max’s lashes as he leaned closer beneath the glow of the Eiffel Tower. The city shimmered around you — golden lights, distant laughter, the hum of life moving on — but for a moment, it felt like the world had narrowed down to just the two of you.

Five years together. Five years of love, fear, laughter, and finally choosing each other.

Max laced his fingers through yours, his breath misting in the cold. “Five years,” he murmured, a soft grin tugging at his lips. “And you still look at me like I’m the one who’s perfect.”

You swallowed, your heart pounding. The snowflakes blurred as emotion filled your chest.

“Because you are,” you said quietly. “Because you’re the only one who’s ever truly understood me. The only one I’ve ever loved.”

You stepped back.

Then you dropped to one knee.

Max froze.

The ring box felt warm in your hand despite the winter air. Around you, snow swirled like something out of a dream.

“So, Max,” you said, voice shaking just enough to betray how much this meant. “Will you marry me?”

For a heartbeat, he just stared.

Then his eyes filled with tears.

“Are you fucking serious right now?” he whispered, voice cracking.

You laughed softly. “Yeah. I am.”

He let out a broken sob of a laugh and dropped to his knees in the snow in front of you, not caring that his pants were soaking through. He cupped your face like he was afraid you might disappear.

“Yes,” he said. “Yes, I will.”

You stood and pulled him into your arms, kissing him like the world might end tomorrow. You spun him in the falling snow, laughing, breathless, dizzy with happiness.

“You asshole,” he laughed against your lips. “You waited five years just to propose under the Eiffel Tower? You’re so extra.”

You pressed your forehead to his. “I wanted it to be as perfect as you.”

He kissed you again, slow and full of promise, while Paris watched and the snow kept falling — the beginning of forever written into the night.

Two years later. 

we’re standing at the altar with the ocean roaring behind us, salt in the air and sunlight catching on every happy tear. The words man and man have barely finished echoing before we’re kissing—like we’ve waited our whole lives for permission to breathe. Friends and family blur into the background. Nothing exists but him, his hands trembling against my face, the way he laughs softly into the kiss as if joy alone might undo him.

“Forever sounds fucking perfect,” Max says, wiping at his eyes and smiling like he can’t believe this is real. He looks out at everyone we love, then back at me, and I know—this is it. This is home.

Years pass the way gentle waves do—steady, constant, full of meaning.

Five years later, we stand in our backyard, hands intertwined, watching our children chase each other through the grass. Two beautiful souls. One has my dark hair, the other Max’s bright, unmistakable eyes. Their laughter fills the space between us, proof of every choice we made, every fight we survived, every promise we kept.

Max slips an arm around my waist and pulls me closer, pressing a soft kiss to my temple. Time has only made him more himself—more kind, more handsome, more everything. When I squeeze his hand and lift it to my lips, I murmur the words we’ve never stopped saying.

“Till death do us part.”

His thumb brushes over my knuckles, warm and familiar. He looks at me the same way he did years ago, back when we were younger and standing beneath the Eiffel Tower, hearts racing with the terror and thrill of first love.

“And even after death,” he says quietly.

And the younger ones that are definitely the millennials don’t get me at all.

I’m a person who is from very many places in this country and have very different views than the majority. I also spent the majority of my formative adult years overseas serving in the military. I know this is a longshot, but I’m approaching 45 and I would really like someone to sit down and have a coffee or a glass of wine or a joint while we sit there and look at birds and talk about different things that we’re planting while the world around us comes to an end and we can understand it because we’ve been watching terminator our whole lives.

Maybe you’re married maybe you’re not, and that’s OK. but I’m looking for a friend for me,not me and my man. So if you have a dude and he has expectations of being friends with my man, then I give up. This is partly why I posted this because my dude is very solitary.  Either way, life is a journey.  I’ve been married to the same dude for over 20 years. We’ve been through some shit. I love him to death.

I’m someone who came from much of nothing and who has surprisingly made something of myself. I don’t really relate to people who came from money, straight up, and I’m not someone who stayed poor. In fact, I suffered from imposter syndrome quite often.

Fun aside, my week has been for the dogs.

I went to a new doctor this week.

I’m sick now.

They shoved their little light/magnifier way up one of my nostrils, like they were trying to hurt me, they say “oh looks inflamed.” Yeah! Now it is! The other nostril had no such uh favoritism, but since that tool went inside me I’m sick now.

I rarely get sick. It might be a flu; body aches, skin pain, cough. I also could’ve overworked myself benching or it’s atmospheric crap from the mold prevention the basement is undergoing.

It’s just scary and a problem when the cure is the catastrophe. Go to the doc, get sick, go back to the doc; Big Pharma gets paid.

I want someone who has intentions on meeting outside of Reddit when time is right. Not just moving around to different apps and chatting. Someone who wants something serious.  

Why Reddit? 

\- I’ve tried the apps, walking around Trader Joe’s, going out, and having less of a RBF. All this things haven’t led me anywhere but some awkward eye contact and conversations about the weather, so this had led me to Reddit. I’ve crept around some of these subreddits so why not try?

I love action drama shows like the lioness, landman, etc… I’m currently looking for new series to watch. Music wise I like a bit of everything. I’m usually listen to indie and rap. Lately I’m having my country kick. Not Morgan Wallen country but Chris Stapleton country. I like to read (mostly romance books but I wanna try thriller and mystery) and would consider myself a home body. I do like to go. I’ll go out and find some good coffee or Asian pastries. Go thrift or just go to a park and walk around. Once in a while I like to go out and dance. 

Physically

\-I’m about 5’7 so taller than some girls. I’m brown, with black curly hair, brown eyes, round face, plus size. I know that’s not something everyone’s into but that’s me. 

What I’m looking for

\-I’m looking for someone who wants something serious like I stated in the beginning. I’ve done the lusting over someone. I want love, I want to find my lover boy. Someone funny, assertive, compassionate, goal oriented, someone who’ll make me feel like a first choice. Someone who is left leaning or moderate. 

Physically

\-i mostly am attractive to the vibes but a few physical things I look for is hygiene, well groomed, short hair and tall. 

So if you are interested send me a message and a bit about you. Let’s see if we vibe and I finally find my lover boy 🫶🏽",1,1768701249.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

This raise is supposed 

to be the best we've 

gotten so far,

not just a cost of 

living increase.

I'll be happy to accept it -

it's what I deserve for 

a job well done.

I've worked hard to be here.

The thunk of the clock 

punch is my call to duty

Comforting family,

meeting my patients needs

is an honor and beyond that

destiny

The minimum wage I pay

is every inch of my body.

My job is the backbone

of this organization

built on late nights 

sipping coffee 

Red crosses brandished,

we treat with empathy - and

hold hands especially after 

some bad news has 

been delivered.

Company newsletters attempt

to gloss it over with the mundane

Catholic doses are 

administered to help 

ease the pain.

Patients check themselves 

out early just for a smoke break,

breaths aren't appreciated

until there's no more 

to take.

I treasure my breath -

oh dear God bless it!

I'm sure to give gratitude 

when I find the time 

to catch it.

Some mornings I clock out 

with blood on my hands 

but at peace and a 

head quite clear -

a surprising perk 

of my career

but it doesn't help 

the heart break when 

a sheet's draped and a 

gurney’s rolled away.

I just stay focused on 

the good work I've done, 

and come back proud

1qfvkqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qfvkqs/i_think_my_parents_are_bad_people/,I think my parents are bad people,"As the title says, even if I love them very much, I think my parents are bad people, or at least not good examples neither for me or my brothers. I'm 18, and I have two younger brothers, one 14 and one 8, and my parents have always been like this, even when I was an only child.

Let me start off with my dad, who is more harmful to others than to himself (my mom is a lot more harmful to herself, even if that affects others indirectly).

My dad is an extremely violent person, maybe not physically but emotionally and especially verbally. He gets into arguments with my mom every. single. day. I actually CANNOT remember a day where they haven't had one or outright had a fight (verbal, of course, it's not like they hit eachother). They fight in their room, in the kitchen, in the car, everywhere, even with my little brothers present. When things get really heated, they begin insulting, cussing and screaming at eachother. The reason for the arguments vary, but normally they start because of either my mom's hysterical everyday attitude or because of work. There was this particular time a few years ago that got engrained in my mind where my dad said: ""Fuck you and go die"" to my mom, and I don't even remember why the argument started.

Even though it's mostly between them, my dad has had his moments where his anger is directed at me and my brothers. Once we were in the car, going to school and we were late, so all of us were pretty stressed. There's an alternative route to get to school that is quicker but my dad doesn't like it, so when I suggested it he told all of us that ""He wasn't taking that route and if that if we didn't like it all of us could go eat shit"". Mind you, I was like 15 at the time and my brothers were 11 and 5.

Another time, when I was like 13 and my brothers 9 and about 3 or 4, we were all playing on the couch, jumping or whatever. My 4 year old brother, while jumping, fell off the couch and started crying. He was 100% okay, but as any 4 year old would, he cried loudly. My parents came rushing in to see what had happened and when I tried to explain my dad told me and my 9 year old brother we were all sons of bitches who didn't take care of their brother. I can understand him getting scared at my little brother getting hurt, but insulting us and blaming us entirely for it when we were just playing?

Even if his anger is normally verbal, there has been a few times when he has gotten physical, not at my family directly but at objects. I'm not talking about slamming doors and such (even if he does that VERY often); when my smallest little brother was about 2, so I was 12 and my other brother 8, we had a baby gate on the main stairs of our home so my baby brother couldn't climb them and get hurt. My 9 year old brother had the admittedly bad habit of jumping over the gate instead of opening it normally when he wanted to go up or down the stairs because it was much easier than unlocking the child-proof lock. My mom had already told him multiple times to stop doing that as every time he put his weight over the gate, he damaged it. One day, he did kinda break the gate after jumping over it, and my mom became really mad. After like 10 minutes of my mom being like that, my dad came down from upstairs and asked her: ""You think he broke the gate?"" And started breaking the metal gate apart with his bare hands, throwing pieces everywhere and then kicking the whole foundation of the gate down. Then, he walked towards us. He asked my mom where her purse was, and my mom having no idea what he wanted her purse for and being shocked because of what he just did told him where it was (on the couch). He then grabbed the purse from the strap, and started slamming it on the coffee table, really, really hard. So hard he obviously broke the purse but also chipped 1 inch wood pieces off the table. He then stormed out of the house angrily. I was fully convinced they were gonna get a divorce after that, even if I didn't want that to happen and ultimately it didn't.

My dad's mood is also extremely volatile. Some days he's all loving and caring and kind, and others he's incredibly cold, violent and touchy. When guests come, it's like he prefers them over us. He gets incredibly mad at us if we do anything that goes against his plans for the guests, which obviously includes screaming and cussing, but when the guests arrive, he becomes all nice and welcoming. It's like he's embarrassed of us.

The thing that pains me the most is that cussing and screaming is something my little brothers and even I have picked up. I know it's not right, so I don't do it, but they don't know any better. My 14 year old brother is now a cussing machine, and can't form a sentence without doing it. I know he's 14 and all, but when I was 14, I didn't do that.

Now it's my mom's turn. As I mentioned at the start, my mom is a lot more harmful to herself than to others, but that harm to herself IS indirectly harmful to us.

My mom is a serious, serious control freak. Control of the house is her absolute favorite thing, and favorite here is not meant to be taken as that she enjoys it, but that she can't live without it, like an alcoholic. She cleans the house thoroughly every. single. day, and still gets mad when there's a speck of dust anywhere. She's also an extremely hysterical person, bordering mental illness in my opinion. She can't get mad normally; she starts off getting mad for any insignificant thing, and it evolves into a hysterical drama fest of screaming and sometimes even crying, and mind you this can be over the smallest thing, like for example the fact my 8 year old brother doesn't like what she made for dinner or something. She does stuff like that every day, and it's unbearable honestly. I can't even like, close the door of my bedroom and wait there until she calms down because she gets even more offended and mad at me ""ignoring her"" and eventually comes in to my room to finish her tantrum there. I know this isn't good for my mental health, I can feel it, and I can see how it affects my brothers too, especially my littlest one. When he does something he's scared will make my mom mad he overcorrects saying things like ""I'm so sorry mom I swear I didn't mean to"". He's 8.

My mom also is completely unable to control her emotions and impulses. Even though I'm not religious in any way, it always seemed weird why gluttony was one of the 7 deadly sins, but now I get why, and my mom is a perfect example. My mom is a glutton, the only person I know who is truly one. She literally CANNOT stop eating, she cannot. She eats even when she's not hungry anymore. When we're eating out, and already finished her own meal, she uses any opportunity to ask for some of our food. At home, she eats quietly in the kitchen so nobody sees her, and it's not like likes eating because she enjoys good food, no, not at all, actually a few days ago she had another tantrum in which she said she hated cooking for us and would prefer if we didn't have to have dinner at all. She eats random shit, like she grabs a slice of bread and pours ketchup on it and downs it, she actually only does it because she enjoys putting food in her mouth and swallowing.

There was this particular time where she sneaked muffins in her purse to eat them when we went out the house.

My mom isn't fat, but she isn't skinny or even ""fit"". She was fairly in shape before, but after the birth of my first little brother she gained a lot of weight, bordering fat, and has been trying to lose it for 14 years, 14 fucking years in which she literally hasn't managed to lose weight. She's done it all; gym, personal trainers, weight loss programs, everything, but it doesn't work because she won't stop eating.

It's not only harmful to her physical appearance, but to her health. Her father has severe heart disease and her mom has had cancer twice, so she's a lot more prone to it, and she doesn't seem to care, she keeps on doing it.

She actually got a 12k dollar weight loss surgery a few months ago, and I don'f think she understands how it works, because even if it obviously made her skinnier as they physically removed fat from her body, she still has to maintain it, but no, she keeps eating still, and is slowly starting to gain some of the weight back.

My dad gets mad at her for this, which is understandable, it's frustrating to see someone literally unable to reach their goals, but being my dad he obviously blows it out of proportion with his approach to the problem, and calls her fat frequently, which obviously gets them into arguments and fights.

I try to help her too sometimes, because I know my dad can be really insulting, so when I catch her eating the random shit she eats I tell her she should stop, but it's like she doesn't want the help, she gets extremely defensive about it and says things like: ""It's my life can you stop controlling it"" or ""what? Am i not gonna ever eat what i want ever again?"".

It's gotten to the point that in like 5 years we have any barely snacks at home, no cookies no cereal, nothing, because when we buy it, my mom eats it, so my dad doesn't let us get them anymore so my mom doesn't finish them herself. Any snacks we bring home don't last an hour, not because my mom eats them in that hour, but because my dad throws them in the trash when he sees them. And yeah you could say it's healthier for us, but it's not like they make up for it. There's literally nothing at home you can eat without cooking, and I know how to cook, but it's hard to do it while being busy with college. And you could say, well, just wait till lunch or dinner, but my mom HATES cooking and cooking for us, she has told us multiple times already. Some days we only get breakfast and then a meal that doubles as dinner/lunch, because she puts everything before cooking. I'm not forcing her to cook, I can cook for myself, but she gets mad when my brothers tell her that they're hungry and ask her when she's gonna cook and she gets especially mad when I cook, because she says I make too much of a mess while cooking, which is stupid, as kitchens are for making messes and then cleaning up when you're done, which I do, but it's like she wants me to clean up while I'm cooking or something. One of her biggest tantrums recently has been because of that exactly.

Because of my mom I've never really had any ""normal"" pets, like a dog or a cat, because they're too ""dirty"" for her. I have birds, which are NOT a compromise and who I adore and care for in the best way I can, but she only lets me have them because they're fairly easy to clean up and she still complains daily about the ""messes"" they make.

Even after all this, my parents still love eachother, and they still love me and my brothers, but between them there's an extremely toxic relationship and I have no idea how it's still standing. There has been multiple times where I was fully expecting them to get a divorce, and actually there have been multiple times where my dad has threatened my mom with it, mostly during fights. I don't want them to get a divorce, I would really prefer if they could just calm the fuck down, but I know that's never gonna happen.

And even then, I feel extremely guilty, because I can't hate them, they're my parents. I can't hate them even though I know they're not good people and that they harm people around them, including myself. Sometimes I'm spending time with my dad and having fun but then I think to myself, how am I spending time with this man who, after any minor inconvenience, has never doubted to be violent towards myself and the rest of my family. I don't know what to think, I'm incredibly conflicted.

I also don't know if this is maybe normal and I'm overreacting. Maybe this is how parents normally act behind closed-doors, and because I've never had any other parents I can't compare them. Because they haven't hit us or abused us physically, I don't know if maybe I'm exaggerating with calling them ""bad people"", maybe I am, but I don't know.",1,1768701202.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I’m 29M AA and started dating 29F AA on 11/9/25. We had mutual friends and had been texting on/off since June 2025 but kept missing each other, I’m pretty laid back so I shrugged it off. We met for the first date for coffee and we instantly hit it off, both healthcare professionals, went to school in the same general area. We met a second time on 11/16 for ice cream and had a good time again, we’re still getting to know each other but we’re hitting it off. The next week we both had engagements on 11/22 but we met up after and had a nice time. The next week was her birthday, she forewarned me she may be late getting ready so on 11/28 I booked 3 dinner reservations. She was ultimately late (her hair appt ran late) so I waited and we made the later reservation. On 11/30 (her actual birthday) she called me last minute to go to a happy hour and meet her friends, I went and that was a decent time. A few days later I told her I would prefer not be late if possible bc sone of my family members consistently run late and it makes me feel like they don’t care about my time. She was receptive, we continued on. On 12/6 we both had to leave (me for a work party, her for a friends trip) so we hung out during the week. On 12/13 we were supposed to go on a date, however after l got off work I told her I have to cancel because I’m going to do something with my dad, but we could re schedule for the following week. This is a turning point in our relationship as from this point on she references this day as the day when I showed her I don’t care about her.  I apologize and she explains that she’s very upset and hurt. She has a brunch scheduled with friends the next day and it snowed that morning so I offer to drive her so she won’t have to worry about the roads, she’s not fully receptive but she lets me drive her and we’re able to talk. By Monday she seems to be back to somewhat normal. We hang out during the week and I leave for Hawaii with my family (mom, dad and sister) from 12/20 - 12/30.

I get back around 2pm and have to drop my sister off at the house for her telework and shower/unpack and she wants me to come over. I tell her that’s fine but I have to do some things first, it’s getting late around 7pm she asks if I could’ve done these things (shower, unpack, go to Walmart) at another time because she’s waiting on me. I tell her no I just got back and was on the plane for hours. She wants me to pick up her food and bring it to her and I tell her I’m really running around she’s at her house she could pick up the food herself instead of giving me more things to do. She says this is another time when I showed I didn’t care about her. I explain to her how much stuff I had to do and that I had to return to work the next morning. Ultimately it was a small hiccup and we continued on. We had an awesome time on NYE. We went to multiple parties her friends invited her to and I meshed well with everyone. We planned to go see wicked 2 on 1/3, however there were limited showtimes so she asked me earlier that day if we could just buy it on tv and watch at home. I say yes that’s fine after I get off work we can do dinner then watch the movie at home. She then she’s going for drinks with friends first, I say okay. Her going for drinks runs late around 1130 and she asks me to just come see her at the house after. I do so and I tell her she canceled on me the same way, she flips it she says she didn’t cancel because it wasn’t a date because we were gonna watch the movie at home. I tell her she asked to do that so in retrospect that seems like it was a trick question. She deflects but ultimately agrees that she canceled because she wanted to go for drinks. We don’t talk the following Monday, she contacts me Tuesday and says she doesn’t like me going the day without speaking to her and it makes her anxious, I explain to her that after conflict I need time to process things. The week from 1/5-1/10 I’m sick with COVID and we don’t see each other. We’re talking on the phone on 1/12 and somehow we start talking about men and women in healthcare professions and she raises her voice saying the reason I matriculated the way I did was because of patriarchy and because I’m a man. I was taken aback because she never raised her voice with me and I generally don’t like that. I also thought we were just having a dialogue. The next day goes by and we don’t speak as I’m taking my time after she yelled at me. She calls me the next morning and yells at me some more saying she cannot go without hearing from me because that makes her anxious. She also says I didn’t ask about her day or her presentation so I don’t care about her then she hung up the phone. On 1/15 I text her telling her I don’t know if it’s working out I don’t like people yelling at me (I unfortunately did this on her sorority’s founders day). We met up yesterday and she said doing that on her founders day made her visibly sad at the festivities and showed I don’t care about her. I explained to her that I’m not into sorority/fraternity I was just communicating how I feel. Generally I like her. We had good experiences but the relationship is still new.

Because the longer I sit here, the more it feels like my brain is trying to erase it.

Like it doesn’t want me to survive having the truth inside me.

My father had one rule.

It was never spoken out loud, never written down, never explained like normal parents explain rules.

There was no “because I said so.”

No punishment chart.

No warnings.

It was something I learned the way you learn to fear fire.

By getting burned.

The rule was simple:

We do not acknowledge my mother.

Not with words.

Not with eye contact.

Not with gestures.

Not even with silence that admits she exists.

And the worst part?

She wasn’t dead.

She lived in the house with us.

Every morning, I’d come downstairs and she’d be in the kitchen.

Always in the kitchen.

She wore the same faded floral apron every day, tied too tightly around her waist, like she was trying to keep herself from… unraveling.

She would hum softly while cooking.

The kind of humming that sounds warm and normal if you don’t listen too closely.

If you did listen, you’d realize she wasn’t humming a song.

She was humming the same two notes again and again.

Like a signal.

Like a code.

“Good morning, sweetheart,” she would say to me.

Her voice was gentle, almost too gentle.

Like she was afraid of scaring me.

And every morning…
I’d look straight through her.

My eyes would lock onto something behind her.

The coffee pot.

The microwave clock.

The cabinet handles.

Anything.

Because if I looked at her, even for a second…
My father would know.

He always knew.
He’d be sitting at the table with his newspaper open, hiding his face like he was reading, but his eyes would be tracking me from behind the paper.

I would grab my bowl.

Pour cereal.

Sit down.

My mother would sigh—just once—and set a third plate on the table.

Always between me and my father.

Always filled with food.

And my father would never touch it.

He would never even let the plate stay.

The moment my mother turned her back, my father would lift it with two fingers like it was contaminated and throw it into the sink.

No anger.

No expression.

Just… routine.

When I was younger, I asked him why.

I shouldn’t have.

I still remember the way the air changed when I said it.

Like the whole house held its breath.

“Dad,” I whispered, “why can’t we talk to Mom?”
His eyes snapped up from the newspaper.

They were calm.

Too calm.

He didn’t shout.

He didn’t hit me.

He just stared at me like I had done something irreversible.

Then he leaned forward and said, in a voice so low I barely heard it:

“Because she’s not your mother anymore.”

I remember my throat tightening.

“But she looks like her.”

He nodded once.

“That’s how it gets you.”

I didn’t understand.

Not then.

I understood later.

When I was thirteen, I broke the rule for the first time.

Not on purpose.

It was an accident.

My mother was standing in the hallway outside my room that night.

I had woken up thirsty and stepped out half-asleep, and there she was.

Just… waiting.

Her hair was loose, falling in messy dark strands around her face.

She wasn’t smiling.

She wasn’t humming.

She looked tired.

Real tired.

Like she hadn’t slept in years.

I froze.

I should’ve gone back into my room.

I should’ve shut the door.

I should’ve pretended she wasn’t there.

But she did something that made my stomach twist.

She lifted her hand slowly…
And pointed at my door.

Then she pointed at the ceiling above it.

Then she put her finger to her lips.

Shhh.
I stood there, heart pounding, staring at her like my body didn’t know what to do.

Then I whispered, barely audible:
“…Mom?”

The moment I said it, the hallway light flickered.

Once.

Twice.

And her face changed.

Not like a normal expression change.

Not like a smile turning into a frown.

Her face shifted.

Like something underneath her skin moved.

Her eyes widened.

Her pupils grew too large.

And her mouth opened in a way that was just slightly too wide.

She didn’t speak.

She didn’t breathe.

She just stared at me with a hunger that didn’t belong in a human face.

Behind me…
My father’s bedroom door opened.

I didn’t hear footsteps.

I didn’t hear him walk.

But suddenly, he was there.

Standing in the dark behind me.

His hand grabbed my shoulder so hard I felt bruises form instantly.

He pulled me back into my room and slammed the door.

Then he locked it.

From the outside.

I screamed.

I begged.

I pounded on the door.

He didn’t answer.

And on the other side of the door…
I heard her.

My mother.

Or whatever she was.

Her nails dragged down the wood.

Slow.
Deliberate.

Like she was carving the sound into my memory.

Then she whispered my name.

Not once.

Not twice.

Over and over.

Like she was tasting it.

Like she was practicing how to say it right.

I stayed awake all night, pressed against the wall farthest from the door, staring at the darkness until my eyes burned.

And when the sun came up…
It stopped.

Like it had never happened.

The next morning, my father acted normal.

He made coffee.

He read his newspaper.

He didn’t look at me.

He didn’t apologize.

He didn’t even mention it.

But when I sat down at the table, he finally spoke.

“If you ever say her name again,” he said calmly, “I won’t be able to stop it.”

My mouth went dry.

“Stop what?”

He folded his newspaper.

Looked me dead in the eyes.

And said:
“Her.”

Then he stood up, walked to the sink, and threw away the third plate of food like he always did.
Years passed.

I learned how to live with the rule.

I learned how to exist in a house with a woman I wasn’t allowed to acknowledge.

It became second nature.

Like ignoring a ticking bomb.

My mother continued to cook.

To clean.
To hum.

To smile at me like she missed me.

But her smile always looked like it was slightly delayed.

Like she was copying what a smile should be.
And sometimes…

When she thought I wasn’t looking…

Her eyes would follow me in the mirror.

Not directly.

Just enough to remind me she knew I was there.

And that she was waiting.

Then my father died.

It was sudden.

A heart attack, the doctors said.

He collapsed in the living room one evening.

His coffee spilled onto the carpet.

His eyes stayed open.

And for the first time in my life…
The house went completely silent.

No humming.

No footsteps.

No movement.

Like everything was listening.

I called 911.

I watched strangers carry his body out.

I signed papers.

I cried.

I did all the things you’re supposed to do when someone dies.

But deep inside…
I felt something else.

Something cold.

Something crawling.

Because I knew what his death meant.

The rule was gone.

The only thing holding it back…
Was gone.

That night, I didn’t lock my bedroom door.

I didn’t know why.

Maybe part of me wanted to see if I had imagined everything.

Maybe part of me thought I was finally free.

I lay in bed staring at the ceiling until my eyes blurred.

Then I heard it.

The humming.
Two notes.

Soft at first.

Then closer.

Then right outside my door.

My skin prickled.

My throat tightened.

And then…
The door creaked open.

Slowly.

So slowly.

Like it didn’t want to scare me.

Like it wanted me to choose to look.

A shadow stretched across the floor.

And my mother stepped into the room.

She stood beside my bed, staring down at me.

I could smell her.

Not perfume.

Not soap.

Something old.

Wet.

Like clothes left in a closed washing machine too long.

She leaned forward.

Her hair fell around her face like curtains.

And she whispered:
“Now you can talk to me.”

My mouth opened.


My brain screamed at me to stay silent.

But my father was gone.

The rule was gone.

And I was tired.

So tired.

I swallowed.

And I said it.

I said her name.

“Mom.”
Her smile widened.

Too wide.

Her cheeks didn’t move with it.

Just her mouth.

Stretching.

Pulling.

Like it was tearing from the corners.
“Good boy,” she whispered.

Then she reached down and touched my forehead.

Her fingers were freezing.

Not cold like winter.

Cold like meat in a freezer.

The moment she touched me, my vision blurred.

The room spun.

And I realized…
I couldn’t move.

Not my arms.

Not my legs.

Not my head.

I could only breathe.

Shallow.

Panicked breaths.

She leaned closer until her lips were inches from my ear.

And she whispered:
“Your father was very strong.”

I tried to scream.


Nothing came out.

“Every day,” she continued, “he kept you from seeing me.”

Her nails traced down my cheek.

Light.

Gentle.

Like affection.

But her nails were sharp.


And they left thin burning lines in my skin.

“Do you know what happens,” she whispered, “when you acknowledge something that was never meant to be acknowledged?”

Her voice was changing now.

Layering.

Like multiple voices speaking at once.

My eyes watered.

My body trembled.

She smiled again.

And her teeth…
Her teeth weren’t normal.

Too many
Too thin.

Too clean.

Like a shark trying to pretend it’s human.

She pressed her mouth close to my ear.

And said:
“You let me in.”

I don’t remember falling asleep.

I don’t remember waking up.

I only remember one thing.

A sound.

A wet sound.

Like something peeling.

Like tape ripping off skin.

I opened my eyes.

Morning sunlight filled my room.

My body could move again.

I sat up, breathing hard, drenched in sweat.

My room looked normal.

Everything looked normal.

For a second, I thought it was a nightmare.

Then I looked at my bedroom door.

There were scratch marks on the wood.

Long.

Deep.

Like something had tried to get in.
Or out.

I stumbled out of bed and ran to the bathroom.

I turned on the light.

Looked into the mirror.
And froze.

There were thin lines on my cheek.

Four of them.

Like fingernail marks.

Still red.

Still fresh.

And under my left eye…
Something else.

A small dark spot.

Like a bruise.


But it wasn’t a bruise.

It was a fingerprint.

Burned into my skin.

Like a brand.

I stared at it, shaking.

Then…

Behind me…

In the mirror…

I saw her.

My mother.

Standing in the doorway.

Smiling.

But her smile was different now.

Satisfied.

Like she had finally finished something she’d been working on for years.

I spun around.

She was gone.

The bathroom was empty.

The house was quiet.

But the air felt… occupied.

Like something had moved in.

I packed a bag that day.

I didn’t even shower.

I didn’t even eat.

I grabbed my keys and ran out of the house like it was on fire.

I drove to a motel two towns away and locked myself inside.

I thought distance would help.

I thought leaving would break whatever had started.

That was two nights ago.

And I haven’t slept since.

Because every night…

At exactly 2:14 AM…

My motel door handle starts to turn.

Slowly.

Testing.

Like it’s checking if the lock is real.
And every night…

A voice whispers from the other side.

Soft.

Patient.

Hungry.

“Open it.”

Last night, I didn’t answer.

I held my breath.

I stayed still.

The handle stopped turning.
And I thought…

Maybe it gave up.

Maybe it couldn’t follow me here.

Then the voice whispered again.

This time, not from outside the door.

From inside the room.

Right behind my ear.

“Good boy.”

I’m posting this now because I need someone to believe me.

I need someone to tell me what to do.

Because my phone just buzzed.

I looked down.

And there’s a new notification.

From a number I don’t recognize.

It’s a photo.

It’s the inside of my childhood house.

The kitchen.

The table.

Two plates.

And a third plate placed perfectly in the middle.

And written across the plate, in something dark and wet, are three words:

“ACKNOWLEDGE ME AGAIN.""

And the worst part?

Under the photo…

The message says:

SENT FROM YOUR LOCATION.

If I stop replying…

If I stop posting…

Please don’t come looking for me.

Because if you acknowledge me…

And I haven’t slept since.

Because every night…

At exactly 2:14 AM…

My motel door handle starts to turn.

Slowly.

Testing.

Like it’s checking if the lock is real.
And every night…

A voice whispers from the other side.

Soft.

Patient.

Hungry.

“Open it.”

Last night, I didn’t answer.

I held my breath.

I stayed still.

The handle stopped turning.
And I thought…

Maybe it gave up.

Maybe it couldn’t follow me here.

Then the voice whispered again.

This time, not from outside the door.

From inside the room.

Right behind my ear.

“Good boy.”

I’m posting this now because I need someone to believe me.

I need someone to tell me what to do.

Because my phone just buzzed.

I looked down.

And there’s a new notification.

From a number I don’t recognize.

It’s a photo.

It’s the inside of my childhood house.

The kitchen.

The table.

Two plates.

And a third plate placed perfectly in the middle.

And written across the plate, in something dark and wet, are three words:

“ACKNOWLEDGE ME AGAIN.""

And the worst part?

Under the photo…

The message says:

SENT FROM YOUR LOCATION.

If I stop replying…

If I stop posting…

Please don’t come looking for me.

Because if you acknowledge me…

She’ll know you exist too.",5,1768700463.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

\# ∴THE QUESTIONING HEART

\*\*A Journey from Certainty to Wisdom\*\*

\_∴Whyte\_

A guide for those seeking clarity over certainty. This book invites you to examine your beliefs—not to dismantle them, but to sharpen them through humility, empathy and curiosity. Every question in these pages is a compass, not a weapon. Use them wisely.

\---

\## Part I – The First Questions (The Outer World)

\### Chapter 1 – The Art of Curious Argument

In debates, people often behave like warriors defending a fortress. They stockpile arguments, fire verbal arrows and construct walls to protect their beliefs. This chapter invites you to step out of the fortress and into the marketplace of ideas, where the goal is not to defeat an opponent but to exchange goods.

\#### Steelmanning: Seeing the Best in the Other’s View

When someone disagrees with you, ask yourself: What is the best version of their argument? Can you articulate it in a way they would recognize and endorse? Philosopher Daniel Dennett calls this “steelmanning,” the opposite of the familiar strawman. Doing so forces you to listen carefully rather than caricature. If you struggle to describe the other person’s position without sarcasm or exaggeration, you probably haven’t understood it yet.

Try writing their argument in your own words and then reading it back to them. If they say, “Exactly,” you have succeeded. If they correct you, keep listening. This exercise is not about surrendering your perspective; it is about ensuring you are actually engaging with what they mean rather than a distorted projection.

\#### The Life Behind the Belief

Our views do not emerge from a vacuum. Social Identity Theory, developed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner, explains how people define themselves through group memberships. We derive self-esteem from our in-groups and tend to favour them, sometimes leading to prejudice against out-groups. When someone holds a belief you find incomprehensible, consider what experiences or communities might have shaped it. Ask: What would someone have to live through to see the world this way? Avoid lazy explanations like “They’re just stupid” or “They’re evil,” which rarely illuminate anything.

Similarly, explore your shared ground. Even in heated disputes, there is usually at least one underlying value both parties cherish—safety, freedom, dignity, fairness. Naming this common value can reduce defensiveness and shift the tone from adversarial to collaborative.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Steelmanning practice\*\* – Watch a televised debate or read an opinion piece you disagree with. Summarize the author’s thesis and supporting points in two paragraphs. Ask a friend who agrees with the author to review your summary and tell you whether it is fair.

2. \*\*Walk a mile\*\* – Think of a belief you find repugnant. Write a diary entry from the perspective of someone who holds that belief, making their motivations coherent and sympathetic. This doesn’t mean you adopt the belief; it means you practice empathy.

\### Chapter 2 – Stress-Testing Your Ideas

Holding beliefs is like building bridges. A bridge that looks sturdy on a sunny day may crumble under a heavy load or in a storm. Engineers stress-test their designs by simulating high winds and heavy traffic; we can stress-test our ideas in a similar way.

\#### Update Triggers

Ask yourself: What piece of new information would make me update my opinion? Not necessarily reverse it completely, but modify it. Being explicit about what evidence would shift your view makes your thinking transparent and flexible. If you cannot imagine any evidence that would change your mind, you may be clinging to identity rather than understanding.

Think of your current beliefs as hypotheses rather than immutable facts. Just as scientists revise hypotheses when experiments contradict predictions, you can adjust your beliefs when confronted with reliable data or persuasive arguments. Curiosity prepares the brain for learning, and the reward system engages when we satisfy that curiosity; use that neurobiological advantage to make intellectual updates feel like victories rather than defeats.

\#### Belief as Comfort vs. Belief as Map

Some beliefs help us understand the world. Others help us belong or feel virtuous. There’s nothing inherently wrong with seeking comfort, but conflating comfort with truth can be dangerous. Consider asking: Is this belief primarily helping me make sense of reality, or is it primarily helping me feel like a good person or part of my group? Social identity research shows that group membership often boosts self-esteem and provides a sense of purpose and belonging. Therefore, beliefs that signal group loyalty can feel deeply tied to our identity.

Another stress test: Could this idea, applied in a different situation, lead to harm? Principles are powerful because they generalize. But if a principle yields good outcomes in one context and disastrous outcomes in another, it might need refinement or limiting conditions.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Prediction audit\*\* – Pick a topic you care about (economic policy, education, environmental regulation). Write down three specific predictions you are willing to make about future developments. Later, revisit them. Where you were wrong, adjust your underlying assumptions.

2. \*\*Counter-story\*\* – Identify a belief you hold about human nature (“Most people are selfish,” “Humans are basically good,” “People are motivated by incentives”). Then write a story in which that assumption fails. How would that exception change your generalization?

\### Chapter 3 – Navigating the Information Ocean

We swim in a sea of information, some of it nourishing, some toxic. Learning to assess the quality of what we consume is as vital as learning to assess the quality of our food.

\#### Source Audit

First, ask: Where did I get this information? A university press release, a peer-reviewed journal, a viral tweet and a pundit’s blog all have different levels of reliability. The Western Nevada College Library suggests using the “CRAAP” test to evaluate information sources:

\- \*\*Currency\*\* – How current is the information?

\- \*\*Relevance\*\* – Does it meet your needs?

\- \*\*Authority\*\* – Who produced it and what are their credentials?

\- \*\*Accuracy\*\* – What evidence supports it?

\- \*\*Purpose\*\* – Why was it created?

Evaluating sources using these criteria helps you avoid misinformation and make better decisions.

Second, consider whether the people presenting the information also sell solutions to the problem they highlight. There’s nothing wrong with offering products or services, but it can create a conflict of interest. Ask: Do the people warning me about a crisis also sell the remedy? If so, treat their claims with extra scrutiny and look for independent confirmation.

Finally, ask: If this information turned out to be false, who would benefit? Misinformation often benefits those who stand to gain financially, politically or ideologically from a distorted public narrative. Being aware of those incentives helps you weigh claims appropriately.

\#### Lateral Reading

Professional fact-checkers often use “lateral reading”: rather than staying on a single website, they open new tabs to investigate the author, organization and claims. They check multiple sources to see whether the story is corroborated by independent outlets. For example, a claim about a medical study should be traceable to a peer-reviewed paper or a reputable scientific institution. If the only evidence is a blog quoting another blog quoting a social media post, you should be skeptical.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Source evaluation\*\* – Choose an article on a controversial topic. Apply the CRAAP test to evaluate its trustworthiness. Write down your assessment for each criterion.

2. \*\*Follow the money\*\* – Select a prominent advertisement or promotional campaign related to health or finance. Trace who finances the organization behind it. Does the funding source align with the message?

\### Chapter 4 – Disagreement Done Well

Disagreement can be productive when approached with the right intention. Instead of trying to win, try to understand. Ask yourself: Am I arguing to score points, or am I arguing to discover something? Research on cognitive biases shows that when people feel their identity is under attack, they become more defensive. Presenting information non-confrontationally allows others to evaluate new ideas without feeling assaulted.

\#### Anticipate Criticism

Ask: What is a common criticism of my position? Then formulate your best response. This practice strengthens your argument and reveals its vulnerabilities. If you cannot answer the criticism convincingly, reconsider your stance.

\#### Choose Your Battles

Not every conversation is worth engaging in. Evaluate whether the other person is open to discussion and whether the context is appropriate. Online comment sections rarely foster fruitful dialogue. Your time and energy are valuable; spend them where they can have real impact.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Opposite day\*\* – For one day, whenever you encounter an opinion you disagree with, instead of immediately countering, ask three genuine questions to understand the reasoning behind it.

2. \*\*Disagreement journal\*\* – After a disagreement, write down how you felt, what triggered defensiveness and how you might respond differently next time to seek understanding rather than victory.

\### Chapter 5 – Beliefs in Action

Beliefs are not static propositions; they shape how you act and how you treat people. Ask yourself: Does holding this belief make me kinder and more effective, or more angry and frustrated? If a belief consistently fuels rage without leading to constructive action, it may be harming your well-being.

Similarly, imagine a world in which everyone held your belief. Would that world be better? If the universal adoption of your belief would lead to oppression, violence or stagnation, reconsider its broader implications. Beliefs can serve as tools—helping you navigate life—or as badges, signalling your identity to others. Wearing a badge loudly might win you recognition from your tribe, but it doesn’t necessarily help you solve real problems.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Belief impact log\*\* – Over one week, note situations in which a particular belief influenced your behaviour. Evaluate whether that influence was helpful or harmful.

2. \*\*Badge or tool\*\* – List five of your strong beliefs. For each, determine whether it functions more as a tool to understand the world or a badge to identify with a group. If it is primarily a badge, explore whether the underlying value could be expressed in a more actionable form.

\### Chapter 6 – Flexibility: Strength in Adaptation

Rigidity is brittle. Flexibility is strength. Ask yourself: What is something I once believed strongly but no longer do? Examine what changed your mind. Was it painful or freeing? Recognizing that you have changed your mind in the past makes it easier to accept that you might do so again in the future.

You can hold a belief strongly while acknowledging you might be missing something. This posture—conviction with openness—allows you to act decisively while remaining receptive to new evidence. It also reduces the cognitive dissonance that arises when new information conflicts with your identity.

Finally, consider whether it is more important to you to be consistent with your past self or accurate based on what you know now. Consistency can be admirable, but clinging to outdated beliefs out of fear of seeming inconsistent keeps you from growing. Intellectual humility encourages us to moderate our need to appear right.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Belief timeline\*\* – Draw a timeline of a belief you have held for at least ten years. Mark key events that influenced it. Reflect on how it evolved.

2. \*\*Consistency challenge\*\* – Choose a public stance you’ve taken. List reasons it might be mistaken. Practice explaining how and why you might update that stance if new evidence arises.

\### Chapter 7 – How to Use These Questions Without Feeling Threatened

Intellectual self-examination can feel risky, so start small. Apply these questions to others before you apply them to yourself. Watch a debate and practice summarizing the best version of each participant’s argument. Use the questions on low-stakes topics like sports or movies before applying them to politics or religion. Building the muscle of curiosity on minor matters prepares you for heavier ones.

\#### Focus on Usefulness Over Truth

Ask, “Is this a useful way to see this?” rather than “Is this true?” The latter can trigger defensiveness. A belief can be useful even if imperfectly true, and exploring its usefulness often leads you back to its truth. Remember that the goal is not to have no opinions. It is to hold well-built, stress-tested opinions that you can update when reality demands it.

\## Part II – The Middle Questions (The Bridge to the Inner World)

\_Full chapter content inserted from master manuscript.\_

\### Chapter 8 – The Stories We Tell Ourselves

We are storytelling animals. Every day, we make sense of life by telling simple stories about ourselves—“I’m the responsible one,” “Bad things always happen to me,” “I’m the hero of my family.” These narratives give us identity, purpose and continuity, yet they can also blind us to evidence that doesn’t fit. This chapter invites you to look at the scripts you’ve internalised and ask gentle, practical questions about them.

\#### The Hero’s Story

Ask yourself: What is the “hero’s story” my beliefs allow me to tell about myself? Do you cast yourself as the brave defender of truth, the compassionate saviour or the oppressed underdog? While such narratives can motivate, they can also prevent you from seeing nuance. Stories need villains, and when your story requires an enemy, you might distort the motives of those who disagree with you. Recognize when you are narrating rather than noticing.

\#### Ignored Evidence

What evidence do you ignore because it doesn’t fit the narrative of your life? Confirmation bias—the tendency to seek information that supports our beliefs—is reinforced when contradictory evidence threatens our hero narrative. To counter this, cultivate a habit of deliberately seeking disconfirming evidence. Treat anomalies not as threats but as opportunities to refine your story.

\#### Failure or Learning?

When you are proven wrong, does your story become one of failure or one of learning? A story of failure says, “I was stupid,” and leads to shame. A story of learning says, “I discovered something I didn’t know,” and leads to growth. The difference lies in whether your narrative values being right more than being wiser tomorrow.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Narrative inventory\*\* – Write down the roles you habitually assign yourself in stories (e.g., hero, victim, rebel, rescuer). For each, list beliefs that support that role. Identify evidence you tend to ignore to maintain the story.

2. \*\*Plot twist\*\* – Imagine a plot twist that undermines your current narrative. How could this twist lead to a more complex, compassionate story rather than a crisis of identity?

\### Chapter 9 – The Weight of Your Tribe

Belonging is a basic human need. We all want to fit in—at home, at school, on social media, in sports teams and political parties—and we often adopt the language and beliefs of those around us so we don’t feel alone. This chapter explores how that desire to belong influences our opinions and how to stay true to yourself in the midst of it.

\#### Belonging Beliefs

Which of your beliefs make you feel like you belong to your community? What would happen if you let one of them go? Often, certain opinions serve as entrance tickets to a group. Expressing doubt about those opinions may risk exclusion. Distinguish between beliefs you hold because they seem true and beliefs you hold because they signal loyalty.

\#### Speaking for Yourself or Performing?

When you share an opinion, ask: Am I speaking for myself or performing for my group? Do you feel pressured to amplify outrage or virtue signal? If your audience were anonymous or your social group invisible, would you express the same view? The act of performing a belief publicly can sometimes entrench it internally, even if you did not initially hold it strongly.

\#### Private Thoughts

Who in your life would be most surprised by your real, private thoughts on a controversial topic? The gap between your public persona and private mind reveals where group expectations weigh most heavily. Closing that gap by aligning your outer expression with your inner understanding can be liberating, but it may come with social costs. Weigh those costs against the benefit of authenticity.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Group map\*\* – Draw a map of the groups you belong to (family, workplace, political affiliation, faith community, hobby clubs). For each, list the beliefs you feel expected to hold. Mark those you genuinely endorse and those you are ambivalent about.

2. \*\*Secret ballot\*\* – Write down your honest opinion on a contentious issue. Seal it in an envelope. If your community discovered it, how would they react? Consider whether their potential reaction influences how you speak publicly.

\### Chapter 10 – The Engine of Emotion

Reason is often described as a sober driver, but emotions are always along for the ride—humming quietly in the passenger seat or, more often than we admit, grabbing the wheel. Love, fear, anger and hope colour our opinions on politics, work and even coffee. When a belief tied to our identity is challenged, it can feel like an attack, triggering a stress response that hijacks our ability to think clearly. This chapter helps you name and work with those feelings so that you can think with both your heart and your head.

\#### Naming the Emotion

Ask yourself: What emotion is driving my need to be right? Is it fear of losing control? Anger at injustice? A desire for safety? Naming the emotion helps you decide whether the intensity of your reaction is proportionate to the issue at hand. Sometimes, a small disagreement triggers an outsized response because it taps into an old wound. Recognizing the true source of your feeling allows you to respond more appropriately.

\#### Proportionality

When a belief is challenged, does your reaction match the importance of the belief? If you become furious when someone criticizes your favourite sport team, your reaction is likely disproportionate. But if your anger ignites when someone threatens a core value like justice or dignity, it may be more understandable. The goal is not to suppress emotion but to differentiate between the size of the trigger and the size of the reaction.

\#### The Pleasure of Winning

Winning an argument feels good because it triggers a release of dopamine and adrenaline, the same chemicals involved in pleasure and reward. Our brains are hard-wired to protect our beliefs and reward us for defending them. This neurological reward makes it tempting to argue for the sake of feeling right rather than for the sake of learning. Be aware of this “argument high” and question whether you are chasing the feeling rather than seeking understanding.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Emotion journal\*\* – For one week, record moments when you felt a strong urge to defend a belief. Note the situation, the belief, the initial emotion and any underlying feelings. Reflect on patterns.

2. \*\*Pleasure fast\*\* – Avoid arguing online for a week. Observe whether you miss the emotional rush of winning debates. Use that energy to explore topics with curiosity instead.

\### Chapter 11 – The Map and the Territory

Alfred Korzybski famously said, “The map is not the territory.” Our minds love maps—simple rules like “Saving is always good” or “Follow your passion” that promise to explain how life works. Ideologies, worldviews and theories are maps; reality is the territory. Problems arise when we fall in love with the map and ignore the terrain in front of us. This chapter shows how to update your mental maps when life takes unexpected turns.

\#### Falling in Love with the Map

Ask yourself: Am I more committed to my ideology than to reality? Ideologies offer certainty and coherence. They make the world appear orderly and predictable. But when the territory deviates from the map, clinging to the map leads us astray. Holding the theory lightly allows you to adjust your expectations when empirical data contradicts it.

\#### Correcting the Map or Blaming the Territory

Where has your map failed you before? Did you correct the map or blame the territory? When predictions fail, the intellectually humble response is to revise your model. The defensively proud response is to dismiss the data as aberrant. If your ideology predicts universal flourishing and yet produces widespread harm when implemented, it’s time to redraw the map.

\#### Holding Contradictions

Can you hold two conflicting ideas at once without rushing to resolve them? Many truths are paradoxical. Freedom and security, individuality and community, reason and emotion—these pairs exist in tension. Mature thinking tolerates that tension. Recognize that a map can contain multiple routes, some of which may appear contradictory. Exploring those routes can enrich your understanding.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Map audit\*\* – List your core ideologies (political, religious, economic). For each, write down at least one situation where it produced unexpected or negative results. How did you respond? Did you adjust your ideology or rationalize the outcome?

2. \*\*Paradox meditation\*\* – Choose two values you find in tension (e.g., freedom and equality). Spend time articulating arguments for both sides without trying to resolve them. Notice how holding both perspectives deepens your understanding.

\### Chapter 12 – The Anchor of Identity

Beliefs tether us to an identity. They answer the question “Who am I?” Ask yourself: What three beliefs define me? What would remain of “me” if one of them proved false? The stronger the identification, the scarier it feels to question it. Notice the difference between saying “I believe X” and “I am someone who believes X.” The former leaves room for change; the latter fuses belief with selfhood. This chapter encourages you to explore those attachments with kindness.

\#### Imagining a Different Self

Can you imagine a version of yourself who is wiser and kinder, but who holds different beliefs? Many of us assume that changing a core belief means becoming a traitor to ourselves. But people grow and change over time. The person you were at 15 likely held different views than the person you are now. Projecting forward, the person you will be at 80 may be more compassionate and informed precisely because you allowed yourself to evolve.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Identity inventory\*\* – Write the sentence “I am someone who…” followed by a belief (e.g., “believes in free markets,” “cares about environmental conservation,” “trusts science,” “practices a particular faith”). Then reframe it as “I currently believe…” and notice how the rephrasing feels.

2. \*\*Future self letter\*\* – Write a letter from your 90-year-old self to your present self, offering advice about which beliefs to hold lightly and which values endure.

\---

\## Part III – The Final Questions (The Inner World)

\_Full chapter content inserted from master manuscript.\_

\### Chapter 13 – The Origins of Self

\#### On Belief Origins

Trace your beliefs to their beginnings. If you could follow a belief back to its earliest formation in your life, what would you find? Many convictions are seeded in childhood by caregivers, cultural norms or pivotal experiences. Asking how you would think if you had been born into a radically different culture—a remote Amazonian tribe or a Himalayan monastery—reveals how contingent beliefs can be. Which of your certainties crumble when you ask, “How do I actually know this?”

\#### On Hidden Motivations

Consider what you are protecting by holding a belief. What would you lose if the belief were wrong? Whom might you disappoint by changing your mind? Fear of losing community, identity or meaning often underlies intellectual rigidity. Ask what you are afraid would happen if you truly questioned a belief. Sometimes the anticipated loss is illusory; other times it is real and needs to be grieved.

\#### On Emotional Attachments

Notice where anger arises when a belief is questioned. That anger often protects something vulnerable—perhaps an unresolved trauma or a sense of self. Some beliefs feel so integral to our identity that questioning them feels like self-destruction. Imagine giving up such a belief. What grief surfaces? Allow yourself to feel it. Letting go of a belief can be like losing a loved one; mourning is part of the process.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Belief genealogy\*\* – Choose a conviction. Create a family tree of influences: parents, teachers, media, events. Explore how each contributed.

2. \*\*Culture swap\*\* – Pick a belief and research how people in a very different culture view the same issue. Write a summary of their perspective. Reflect on how your belief might differ if you had grown up there.

\### Chapter 14 – The Illusion of Certainty

\#### On Evidence and Logic

Ask yourself: What would convince me I’m wrong? Have you looked for that evidence? We often demand strict proof for ideas we dislike while accepting weak evidence for ideas we prefer. Question where your standards differ. Identify contradictions within your belief system that you ignore. The research on intellectual humility emphasizes a willingness to reconsider views and to moderate the need to appear right.

\#### On Authority and Trust

Who do you trust to think for you, and why? Some authorities deserve respect for their expertise; others derive power from institutional positions rather than wisdom. Distinguish between trusting someone’s judgement because of their track record and deferring to them because they share your tribe’s anxieties. Ask which authorities you never question and why. Are you outsourcing your thinking to people who confirm your biases?

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Disconfirmation hunt\*\* – For a belief you hold strongly, list evidence that could refute it. Spend an hour actively searching for credible sources that provide that evidence. Evaluate whether it affects your belief.

2. \*\*Authority audit\*\* – List the people and institutions you trust most on various topics (science, finance, politics, spirituality). For each, research an instance where they were wrong. Does that change your level of trust? Should it?

\### Chapter 15 – The View from the End

\#### On Future Self

Project yourself to age 90. What would the wisest version of you think about your current beliefs? Which of your positions might your children find embarrassing? Our future selves often regret arrogance and rigidity more than mistaken details. Write down one message you would send to your younger self about thinking clearly. The advice you give might apply to you now.

\#### On Deathbed Questions

Imagine you have one year to live. Would this belief matter? Would you spend energy defending it? Thinking about mortality strips away trivialities and clarifies what values are truly important.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Legacy reflection\*\* – List the beliefs you hope will endure after you are gone. For each, write why you think it matters.

2. \*\*Deathbed dialogue\*\* – Have a conversation with a friend as if you both had limited time. Discuss which beliefs feel worth holding to the end.

\### Chapter 16 – The Aware Self

At the deepest level, the questions are not about beliefs but about the believer. Who are you when you are not defending any position? What remains if you strip away your opinions? Can you love truth more than you love being right?

\#### On Identity

Ask: Who am I when I’m not defending any position? Sit in silence and let identities drop one by one—profession, nationality, political affiliation, even personality traits. What remains might feel like nothing, or it might feel like spacious awareness. You are not your beliefs; you are the awareness that can observe, question and change them.

\#### On Fear

What are you afraid of discovering about yourself, others or reality? Where do you choose comfortable lies over difficult truths? If you were not afraid of being wrong, rejected or alone, what would you think or do? Fear keeps us clinging to beliefs even when they no longer serve us.

\#### On Freedom

Imagine no one was watching, no one would judge. What would you think, say or do? Where do you mistake rebellion for independence or conformity for wisdom? How often do you choose your thoughts versus inheriting them from your environment? The deepest freedom comes not from having the “right” beliefs but from holding all beliefs lightly.

\#### Exercises

1. \*\*Position fast\*\* – Spend one day avoiding statements of opinion. When you catch yourself asserting a belief, pause and ask why you feel the need to state it.

2. \*\*Fear inventory\*\* – List the top five things you are afraid would happen if you changed a core belief. Next to each, write how likely it is and whether it is worse than living with a belief that might be false.

\---

\## Epilogue – The Gift of Uncertainty

Truth is a process, not a possession. When you think you’ve captured it completely, it slips away. Wisdom whispers while ideology shouts. Most manipulation is self-imposed; we often imprison ourselves within ideas no one forces us to hold. The freedom you seek will not be found in rigid conviction but in informed confidence—beliefs held lightly enough to change when reality demands, yet firmly enough to guide your actions.

Curiosity prepares your brain to learn. Intellectual humility guides you to acknowledge your limitations. Evaluating your sources protects you from misinformation. Recognizing the emotional and social forces acting upon you helps you resist reflexive defensiveness. Admitting mistakes makes others respect you more. Holding your beliefs lightly, with an awareness of their origins and an openness to revision, is the beginning of wisdom.

\### The Ultimate Question

If you remember nothing else from this book, remember this: “What if I’m wrong about everything, and that’s perfectly okay?” The person who can answer “yes” to that question without despair has found the door to freedom. Use these questions as medicine when clarity is needed. Do not live in constant self-questioning; doubt everything occasionally, but doubt nothing constantly. May the questions refine your heart, sharpen your mind and deepen your compassion.

\## Appendix – The Final Questions (Unedited)

The following section contains the original “Final Questions” as provided by STARGLYPHCLARITY. They are included here exactly as they were written, without editing, so that you can refer to them in their pure form.

\### A Lifetime of Refined Wisdom

\#### Preface from STARGLYPHCLARITY

After decades of using these questions and watching their effects, I offer this refined version. I learned that the most powerful questions are often the simplest, and that wisdom comes not from accumulating techniques but from developing the courage to see clearly. For this courage is the price of freedom—freedom from the invisible prisons of fear, dogma and the incessant need to be right.

The young seek complex frameworks. The wise seek simple truth.

\#### The Three Foundations

Before any questioning, establish these:

1. \*\*Loving Detachment\*\* – Can I examine my beliefs with the same gentle curiosity I’d use to study a beautiful but unfamiliar flower? Not to destroy, but to understand.

2. \*\*Humility of Ignorance\*\* – What if most of what I think I know is incomplete or mistaken? Can I find excitement rather than terror in this possibility?

3. \*\*Patience with Process\*\* – Am I willing to sit with confusion and uncertainty rather than rushing to new certainties? Truth reveals itself slowly to those who wait.

\#### The Core Questions

\##### On Belief Origins

\- If I traced this belief to its absolute beginning in my life, what would I find?

\- What would I likely believe about this if I were born to a loving family in a radically different culture?

\- Which of my certainties crumble the moment I ask “How do I actually know this?”

\##### On Hidden Motivations

\- What am I protecting by holding this belief?

\- What would I lose if this belief turned out to be wrong?

\- Who would I disappoint if I changed my mind about this?

\- What am I afraid would happen if I really questioned this?

\##### On Emotional Attachments

\- Where do I feel anger when this belief is questioned, and what does that anger protect?

\- What beliefs feel so much like “me” that questioning them feels like self-destruction?

\- When I imagine giving up this belief, what grief arises?

\##### On Social Programming

\- What do I believe because my tribe believes it, and what do I believe despite my tribe?

\- Which of my moral convictions are about regulating my own inner state, and which are about managing my status within a group?

\- What opinions do I perform rather than actually hold?

\##### On Evidence and Logic

\- What would convince me I’m wrong about this, and have I honestly looked for that evidence?

\- Where do I demand absolute proof for ideas I dislike but accept weak evidence for ideas I prefer?

\- What contradictions in my belief system do I simply ignore?

\##### On Authority and Trust

\- Who do I trust to think for me, and why did I grant them that power?

\- What authorities do I question, and what authorities do I never question?

\- How do I distinguish between wisdom and mere institutional power?

\- How do I distinguish between what I’ve adopted from my tribe’s anxieties versus what I’ve inherited from my tradition’s wisdom?

\##### On Future Self

\- What would the wisest version of myself, looking back from age 90, think about this belief?

\- What beliefs am I holding that my children will someday find embarrassing?

\- If I could send one message to my younger self about thinking clearly, what would it be?

\#### The Advanced Practice

\##### Daily Reality Testing

Each morning ask: “What am I taking for granted today that might not be true?”

\##### The Stranger Test

Before forming strong opinions: “What would an intelligent person from a completely different culture think about this?”

\##### The Enemy Gift

“What valuable truth might my opponents be seeing that I’m missing?”

\##### The Death Bed Question

“If I only had one year to live, would this belief matter, and would I spend energy defending it?”

\##### The Tactical Pause

Before you speak in a charged conversation or write a strong opinion online, pause for three seconds and ask: “Am I trying to share a truth or win a battle?”

\#### The Deeper Recognition

After decades of practice, I realized the deepest questions are not about beliefs but about the believer:

\##### On Identity

\- Who am I when I’m not defending any position?

\- What remains of “me” if I strip away all my opinions?

\- Can I love truth more than I love being right?

\##### On Fear

\- What am I really afraid of discovering about myself, others or reality?

\- Where do I choose comfortable lies over difficult truths?

\- What would I do if I weren’t afraid of being wrong, rejected or alone?

\##### On Freedom

\- What would I think, say or do if no one was watching and no one would judge?

\- Where do I mistake rebellion for independence and conformity for wisdom?

\- How often do I choose my thoughts versus simply inherit them?

\#### The Integration Practice

\- \*\*Weekly: The Mirror Session\*\* – Sit quietly and ask: “What did I believe this week that I didn’t choose to believe?”

\- \*\*Monthly: The Assumption Audit\*\* – List your strongest convictions and ask: “Which of these have I actually tested?”

\- \*\*Yearly: The Perspective Journey\*\* – Seriously study a worldview you’ve always dismissed. Not to adopt it, but to understand what reasonable people see in it.

\#### The Final Wisdom

\- Most manipulation is self-imposed. We often enslave ourselves to ideas that no one is forcing us to hold.

\- Truth is not a possession but a process. The moment you think you’ve captured it completely, it slips away.

\- The deepest freedom comes not from having the right beliefs but from holding all beliefs lightly.

\- Wisdom whispers; ideology shouts. Learn to distinguish between them.

\- You are not your beliefs. You are the awareness that can observe, question and change them.

\#### The Ultimate Question

If you read nothing else, carry this one question with you: “What if I’m wrong about everything, and that’s perfectly okay?” The person who can answer “yes” to this question without despair has found the beginning of wisdom.

\#### A Final Warning

These questions are medicine, not food. Use them when clarity is needed, but don’t live in constant self-questioning. Doubt everything occasionally, but doubt nothing constantly. The goal is not perpetual uncertainty but informed confidence—beliefs held lightly enough to change when reality demands it, but firmly enough to live by.

\#### The Gift

I offer these questions not because the world needs more skeptics, but because it needs more people capable of changing their minds when presented with better evidence. That capacity may be humanity’s greatest hope. Use them well.",1,1768700454.0,eternus_vault,0,1.0,False

1. Go on a walk (whether carried in a carrier or walking with harness) to the coffee shop or around

2. Hang out at the local park outside (probably on a harness/leash)

Generally just enjoy hanging out around in simple spaces. 

From researching I think the main things to focus on would be:

1. Putting the harness on them early and often

2. Getting them used to walking on leash inside them out so they don’t just bolt away

3. Probably some recall work 

4. And somehow using the bathroom outside?

Any tips or guides you guys have found before for some simple outdoor activity training would be great!

There won´t be no more cars holding the entire world

nor will there be warm strawberry deafnesses 

There won´t be no more pianos playing being eyes

nor will there be forest that undress your hurt chest

There won´t be shivers of tears

nor smoke thinking on the window

watching the typewritten black and white parade

at the end of your oniric filmic kisses to our soul 

There won´t be robins singing the medley of tender consciousnesses 

nor coffees who widden smiles until they scratch the Sun 

There won't be concerts dressed of blue and purple

nor theatre plays,

nor movies,

nor flowers,

nor people

as they all achieved their standard expiration date

because it is already a year that your mind isn't here to imagine them

and the blues are less themselves each day

and the Moon comes out each day more sluggish

upon which she pours ,now, without you, her gray fire

Ya no habrán pianos jugando a ser ojos

ni bosques que desnuden tu dolido pecho

Ya no habrá temblores de lágrimas 

ni humo pensando en la ventana

al ver el blanco y negro mecanografiado desfile

al final de tus fílmicos besos oníricos que le das a nuestra alma

Ya no habrán petirrojos trinando popurrí de tiernas conciencias 

ni cafés que agranden sonrisas hasta hacerlas rayar el Sol

I’ve been meaning to post an update about my nine day hard dry fast. Well, I made it six days and six hours. Not too shabby. I beat my previous five day hard dry fast record.

I’m currently in the middle of a nine day soft dry fast since I couldn’t get the time off from work. I’m on day six. And I gotta say, working and dry fasting is way better lol 

My energy is shit, yes. But at least I’m distracted. Makes time go by faster (no pun intended). I’m a barista at a local coffee shop so it’s pretty safe. 

Anyway, my biggest discomfort right now, despite working five whole days while fasted, is my damn saliva! 

I know it’s very minor. But this is the only thing that bothers me. I’m okay being fatigued, I’m okay loosing a bit of sleep, but god almighty I’m gonna end up brushing my teeth hourly at this point haha

How paediatrician has suggested we switch to a CMPA hydrolysed formula (Aptamil Allerpro). We attempted the switch 3 days ago but he refused the bottle, so we have been mixing it with his old formula and slightly upping the ratio. Today we're on about 3/4 new formula to old. He is still not very keen on it but seems to take it when hungry enough (let's say 100 to 120 ml on average). 

I still try to breastfeed him whenever he'll take it - really only after a nap when he's still sleepy and for 2 night feeds. If I had to estimate, I'd say he gets at least 75% of his nutrition from formula, probably even slightly more. We've been through such a difficult journey with breastfeeding and these first few months have been so tough, I don't really want to have to cut out dairy and soy (as the doc recommended) from my diet. I don't consume much dairy anyway, just a dash of milk with coffee and some chocolate or ice cream every other day. I thought it's worth trialling this over the next few weeks to see if just switching formula is enough. Has anyone tried anything similar? 

He was also up last night around 3 am for about 1.5 hours pretty upset and not resettling easily which isn't normal for him. He usually is able to resettle and go back to sleep fairly quickly. I wonder if he's got some discomfort from the new formula? Maybe it's not agreeing with him?

1qfv6cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1qfv6cd/work_in_progress/,Work in progress.,"I still remember her eyes, in them were all my tomorrows. There was peace, love, and a kindness I hadn’t seen up to that point in life, a gentleness only rivaled by the sheer beauty contained within that amber haze of her iris. I still remember her smile, her love and I’ll never forget her pain. I was young then but I didn’t believe it at the time, I had always considered myself to be an old soul of sorts, as if I was older than my actual years allowed. I had lived in a small town in rural America, not small enough for everyone to know everyone but still small nonetheless, my life was rather unremarkable there and I always found myself wishing to escape from the monotony of the place. To do that I’d require money of course so I found work as a carpenter, the pay was never good but there was a certain satisfaction with the work that money couldn’t buy, but I made enough to live, go out with friends and generally enjoy the freedom of youth. Those days now seem all to run together, wake up late, work poorly and promise myself I’d do better the next day only to stay up late with friends and find myself in the same way again. We had a small classic diner in town, oftentimes we ate breakfast there but never really lunch or dinner, I can still taste the burgers and fries and I can still smell the eggs, hashbrowns and coffee. 

“What’ll you get?” asked Bobby peering at me over his glasses 

“Probably the same thing I always get” I replied still looking over the menu which I knew like the back of my hand. 

“Supposed to be a rainy day today, hope you brought coats” announced Steven.

“You know I brought mine boss, I always come prepared unlike dear Johnathan here” 

I ignored his comment, Bobby was a good guy but the only way he knew to show any sort of affection was teasing, if you didn’t know him you’d think him an arrogant ass. 

We sat together there for a while discussing the days events, what jobs we had lined up and how we’d complete them, Bobby teased me for how drunk I was the night before, I had barely begun to drink I told him. We had ate there many times, and were known by all the regular employees, most of them sweet old women just trying to make some extra spending money for themselves but today was different. One fact of life I’ve learned over my years is that big life changing events are never expected, it always happens on a usual Wednesday at work or a waking phone call in the middle of the night, the most pivotal moments in my life always came suddenly upon me and I was never the same after. 

“Its about time you got here, where have you been?” Asked the older woman whom I recognized as some sort of manager.

“Traffic was bad, I’m sorry” replied the girl who’d just walked in, I smiled because I knew there was no way traffic was bad this early in the morning. 

“What’re you smiling about?” Bobby said 

“Nothing, I just admire the courage to lie so openly”

“Well I’d hope you don’t lie at all, especially when it comes to why you’re always so late”  said Steven still looking at his paper and sipping his coffee. 

“Abe Lincoln would be jealous of Johnathan’s honesty boss” replied Bobby with his signature dumb smile,  I was still trying to listen to the conversation between the girl and her boss.

“You’ve made enough excuses, this is the third time this week” 

“I know, I’m sorry. I’ll do better” the girl said putting her head down in shame, it was a move I recognized from my own repertoire. I’d used it many times on Steven after me and Bobbys drunken adventures put me late into work and so I knew what would come next. As soon as the boss turned and walked away all shame and remorse disappeared from the girls eyes and body, her head straightened and her hair fell smoothly down her back again, about halfway down or so. She went to the back to get ready for her day.

“We’ve gotta finish the drywall work at the house on fifth, I wanted to get the shingles done on the yellow house on third but this rain killed that idea”

“We could always make Johnathan do it, worst case he falls and we have to hire someone who’ll actually show up on time” 

“I don’t know how you do it” I replied, “We drink the same and yet I can’t drag myself out of bed and you’re up early” 

“I’m simply just a stronger man, look at these” he flexed his biceps. 

“Doesn’t matter how early we’re up if we sit all day in this diner waiting on food” I said looking around wondering where my sausage biscuit could possibly be. I was hungry. 

“Burger with fries?” Here! Called Bobby “Who eats a burger for breakfast?” I asked. 

“A stronger man than you” he taunted back. The girl smiled to herself and slightly giggled, she didn’t want me to notice.

“Eggs, waffles and toast?”

 “Right here”, Steven said. “And when you can, some more coffee please”

“Of course, I’ll bring it right out, and a sausage biscuit with toast and bacon for you” She looked at me and I felt paralyzed, it took all my presence of mind to muster a simple “Thank you” 

“You’re welcome” she said as she walked to get the coffee. 

There was just something about her, she wasn’t necessarily the prettiest girl I’d ever seen but her brown eyes hidden under her loosely collected hair held a secret which i wished to know, her smiling face failed to conceal the painful life which she lived and I knew or at least suspected at that moment I’d have to get to know her more. My mind went to my love life, if there even was one. I was always a quiet shy person especially in school, sure I had talked to a few girls and I wasn’t a virgin but nothing true ever came from it. And at one point I think I decided to simply give up.

“Here’s that coffee” 

“Thanks” 

I watched her walk away, I had caught a glimpse of her name tag, something with E but she moved too quick, I looked at her ring finger also, not wanting to try and deprive some other fool of his woman.

“She’s new” I said as nonchalantly as I could as to not arouse Bobbys jokes.

“She’s slow, coffee should not take that long”

“Take it easy on Johnny boys new girlfriend boss, did you see the way he choked when she gave his food!” 

“Shut-up. Who is she anyway?”

“Hah I saw you checking her out as she left” 

“Maybe” I replied, stuffing my face with biscuit. “What would be so wrong with it if I did?” 

“Nothing at all, I’d just be happy for you to actually speak to a woman for once, instead of just glare”

“We can’t all be ladies men like you I guess” 

“There’s no one as cool as me” he replied.

We ate quickly and left to do our jobs for the day, every time she stepped out from the back I watched her, she had a few tables, for the most part she did a good job. I noticed her look our way a few times and she came by to check on us once or twice but I was sure she was just doing her job and not at all interested in me. The day was over before I knew it, it was a Friday so me and Bobby got our checks and walked to our vehicles.

“Bar hop tonight? I need to let off some steam” 

“Nah I think I’ll pass tonight, I need a night in to catch up on housework and some sleep if I’m lucky”

“Suit yourself, I’ll see you Monday.”

“See you”

I walked into my home, it was slightly cold so I turned on the electric heater and kicked my shoes off, I was tired and ready for the relaxation only home could provide. A while later I took a shower and opened a beer, not planning on going too far of course. But there was still the problem of dinner, I had neglected to get grocery’s through the week. The phone rang.

“Hello?”

“Johnathan, how are you?” It was my father, we’d never been too close but still called each other somewhat often.

“Doing good here, busy day at work today”.

“Thats good, better it be busy than having nothing to do”

We continued talking for abut a half an hour or so but eventually we both decided to hang up and go back to our separate lives. I was still hungry, a thought crossed my mind “I could go to the diner for some food” a burger sounded great. Of course in the back of my mind I wondered if she’d be there still, I figured not because it was so late but I got some clothes on and made my way to the diner. 

 It occurred to me on my way I had never eaten there alone, always with friends. But I suppose the pursuit of love will make us do things we never even considered. I walked through the door and it’s somewhat busy, a few locals we had done a job for and some truck drivers simply passing through. I took a seat.

“Hey you!” It was her, I hadn’t seen her when I walked in and she took me by surprise. 

“Once wasn’t enough, you had to come back for more huh? Where’s your friends?” 

“They’re my co-workers, I feel sorry for anyone who calls Bobby friend” I said feeling stupid as soon as I spoke.

“Awww he can’t be that bad. What can I get you to drink?” 

“I’ll take a Coke please”

“Alright, I’ll be right back with that and a menu.”

I sat there thinking, her name was Evelyn, I had got to look at her name tag. Her eyes had a look I knew all too well, a look I had seen countless times on my own face in the mirror, a look of dissatisfaction with life and the feeling of wasting the gift of youth. 

“Here’s that drink and a menu”

“I already know what I want”

“Oh ok, what can I get for you?”

“A cheeseburger, hold the onions and pickle please.”

“No onion?! Who doesn’t get onion on their burger?” She said smiling at me teasingly.

“I guess me?” I said, feeling awkward and knowing my face was turning red.

“Well ok, I’ll get this in for you, shouldn’t be long”

“Thanks”

 I sat there and waited, observing the other patrons. An old couple we’d built a fence for, an old grizzled trucker on his way to God knows where, a few other people occupied booths by themselves and then there was me. I was searching mind desperately for something to say to this girl but as it always is when you need something creative, the mind simply won’t cooperate, either way when I saw my food coming it wasn’t her.

“Burger no onion, no pickle?” 

“Thanks, where’d the other waitress go?”

“She gets off at eight” It was seven fifty so I figured she was doing her end of day duties and so had no time to bring my food out.

“She must be new?” I asked the waitress whom I recognized but I don’t believe recognized me.

“She is, been here for only about two weeks now, she’s single.” And with that my new waitress grinned at me with a knowing smile and walked away. 

I was slightly disappointed that the girl had left, but knew it’d more than likely lead nowhere even with my best lines or award winning smile, I simply lacked the confidence at that time. I ate and thought about several things, primarily my past relationships and how they all left me feeling so empty and worthless, I considered the strangeness of our desire for love and the pain it can bring and then I found myself wondering about the girl and her life, her story. I felt like a fool. Before i knew it I was done with my food, I had left a few fries but finished the burger, I paid and left a decent tip and walked out the door to my truck. I saw Evelyn in a small coupe; just sitting there lost in some deep contemplation, she looked tired. She looked up and saw me. 

“Uh hey” she said looking all too embarrassed, I was happy for her to be the embarrassed one now.

“Do you know anything about vehicles”

“A little, but I’m certainly no mechanic; what’s wrong?”

“I don’t know, it just won’t start” She tried to start it again. It was dead.

“Probably the battery, you may have left a light on or something; I have some cables we can jump it off.”

“You are a lifesaver” She said, “I don’t think I could spend another minute here.” 

“It’s no problem” I replied looking through my truck for the cables. After a minute or so I could not find them and realized I must’ve left them at home in my garage.

“Damn it. I took them out a few days ago and never put them back in; let me run home and I can come back and help.”

“How far away do you live?”

“Maybe ten minutes” I replied 

“Could I ride with you there?” She asked this question very sheepishly, like a child asking for a impulse candy purchase at the store, she was very aware of just how odd of a request it was and began to explain when she saw my face become puzzled. 

“It’s just that I don’t want to sit here and I don’t want to go back inside either” 

“Yeah I understand, you can ride with me if you want but I am a complete stranger to you” Times were different then but I still felt it odd she’d trust a complete stranger with a ride to an unknown place at a late hour. 

“I know but you look trustworthy enough, and we’re not necessarily complete strangers, you ate here this morning and the other waitresses said they knew you. And if you try anything I will put up a fight” 

“I’m sure you would, you have a fiery look in your eye” I said smiling “Let’s go then” She got in my truck as if it was hers, putting her purse down somewhat roughly on the floorboard beneath her. I pulled out of the restaurant parking lot and began the drive to my house, it was dark now and I turned on my high beams, the road was quiet and we didn’t speak for a minute but it felt like an eternity. She broke the silence. 

“So what do you do?” 

“I’m a construction worker, we do a lot of stuff around town”

“And those two this morning were your coworkers?” 

“Yeah, the older one is my boss and the younger, fatter one is Bobby. He’s a pretty good friend of mine” She giggled at my observation on Bobbys weight. 

“He’s a good guy, he just only knows how to tease” 

“I remember that this morning” She said smiling. “I don’t think I’ve seen you in there before?” 

“We’re in there pretty often for breakfast, so you must’ve just started” 

“Yeah about two weeks ago, its not bad. I like it except for my boss and the rude customers” 

“That’s why I like my job, Steven deals with the customers, I just stay quiet and do my work” 

“My names Evelyn by the way” She said after realizing we hadn’t even exchanged basic information  about ourselves. 

“I know. Unless you stole that name tag, I’m Johnathan”  

“If I was gonna steal a name it wouldn’t be mine” She said with a self deprecating chuckle. “It’s nice to meet you Johnathan” This conversation continued throughout the ride home, the ten minute drive seemed to pass in a moment but I learned much about her in the brief drive home; She was a silly person, always the first to laugh at something, she didn’t think very highly of herself either. I learned she had moved here from a town just about twenty minutes away, when I asked her why she simply said she didn’t know, I took the hint and left it alone. I learned she had once been a substitute teacher and enjoyed reading, poetry, art and hiking. All of this and more she told me in that first brief ride home but it was the ride back where I learned what would bind me to her and perhaps it was even then I first fell in love with her. 

We pulled up to my home, it was an A-frame style building with a small porch on the front, I was glad it was dark out so she wouldn’t see the mess outside which I had neglected to clean up. I told her to wait in the truck while I found the cables in the shop, I found them sitting right inside on the workbench where I had left them after using them last. Its strange how something I can only call fate works, I always kept them in my truck, I was rather meticulous about that but at that particular time I had forgotten. I wonder sometimes how that night would’ve went had I remembered to put them back? It matters little now.

“I found them, lets get back and get you home”

“Your house looks cozy, I’d be outside on that porch every chance I got”

“Its a nice enough place but it gets cold at night, these old building’s insulation just can’t keep up”

“Do your parents live here? In this town?”

“No, my dad lives over in Shannon, he moved there after my mom passed” 

“I’m sorry to hear that” She said this with a genuine concern that she had broke some social rule by asking about a dead relative.

“It’s alright, she passed several years ago now, I was maybe fourteen. After she passed my dad just kind of gave up on life, drinking himself to sleep every night. I think he wants to slowly kill himself with his lifestyle”

“That’s awful, have you tried to talk to him?”

“Not really, me and him were never very close and after moms death we drifted apart even further, he’s practically a stranger to me now”

“I know how you feel” She said this looking far off in that same contemplative look I’d seen her adopt earlier in the parking lot.

“I guess you’re not very close with your parents?”

“Not at all, I haven’t spoken to them in years”

“How come?” 

“They hate me” She said this with a great conviction and I knew she was about to open up to me about something terrible.

“They didn’t really care about me growing up, and it only got worse the older I got. When I turned fifteen or so is when they started to hit me, they went from not noticing me to noticing me too much” I stayed quiet, knowing its better to listen than to interject in times like these.

“I tried to stay out of the house as much as possible but I didn’t have many friends so that was difficult, once I started working things got better; I could spend more time at work than home. I saved as much as I could for a while and then when I was seventeen I left. I travelled around a bit and eventually came here and found the job as a substitute, I loved it; I loved the kids and teaching them to read. But something about settling down just scares me, the commitment to something just feels impossible; I feel like I’m wasting my time even when I’m enjoying life. Does that make sense?” This was when she stopped and looked at me expecting my input, I got the feeling she hadn’t really meant to share as much as she did and wanted to make sure she hadn’t scared me.

“I understand completely, I like what I do but it feels so empty sometimes, it feels like the days are passing and I get no closer to feeling satisfied. Like theres no big goal for me to go after, just a monotonous day after day and night after night” 

“I thought it was just me who was broken, maybe theres something wrong with both of us” She said with a sad forced smile, I could tell opening up was as frightening to her as it was to me; but little did she know at that moment I felt such a connection to her, something like a feeling or a strong conviction that I must help her and through helping her perhaps help myself also. I began to fall. 

“Maybe we are broken but I think everyone is broken in different ways, take Bobby for example; his parents are both dead, his grandparents raised him and now he womanizes and drinks every night away looking for the love he never received. Hell, I drink too and sometimes I go too far; I can’t remember how many times I’ve blacked out and woke up at home not knowing how I got there” 

“You might be right, but what do we do about our brokenness?”

“What can we do? We can keep living and not let our past days define our future days, yesterday is gone but today is ours and tomorrow if we live to see it will be ours also. I guess what I’m saying is this: I think everyone feels the way you and I do but the difference is they’re afraid to admit it, afraid to look at their brokenness and accept it and do their best to move on and live their best life despite it” 

“Thats a beautiful way of looking at it” She said very thoughtfully as if still running what I had said though her mind. 

“I’ve never opened up to someone this way” She said very matter of factly.

“I don’t guess I really have either, me and Bobby have talked some but he’s the only one, my other friends are all very surface level”

“It feels good to tell someone, its like a weight off my shoulders, I hope you don’t think I’m weird or anything?” 

“Not at all, it feels good to really talk with someone openly and honestly about life, I just hope it helped you?”

“It did, it was good. I’m just awkward and bad at talking about that kind of stuff”

“Nobody’s good at being completely open, its a tough thing to do” And with that our conversation drifted away from life and how it should be lived and into things less profound, soon she was laughing again and smiling. I loved her smile, her little giggle would send me into a place of pure ecstasy. I’ve always been guilty of falling in love too fast, but I can’t help it; I suppose I’ve always had an addictive personality, if something makes me feel good I want more and more of it and nothing made me feel as good as her and her conversation. We arrived back at the restaurant in no time and i jumped her vehicle and stood in her door talking before she left.

“Do you work tomorrow?”

“Yeah, unfortunately”

“Well maybe I’ll come in and see you” 

“That’d be nice, I’m off Sunday. Maybe we could do something together?” 

“I’d love to, Its getting late, you should get home. I’ll come in tomorrow and we can plan what to do Sunday”

“Okay, thanks again for everything” 

“You’re welcome, I’ll see you tomorrow” And with that she waived goodbye as she left and I was alone there in the parking lot, it had started to rain lightly and so I got into my truck and drove home, my mind occupied completely by her; I had much to think about.

1qfv4t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qfv4t0/rf_work_in_progress_first_time_writing/,[RF] Work in progress. First time writing.,"I still remember her eyes, in them were all my tomorrows. There was peace, love, and a kindness I hadn’t seen up to that point in life, a gentleness only rivaled by the sheer beauty contained within that amber haze of her iris. I still remember her smile, her love and I’ll never forget her pain. I was young then but I didn’t believe it at the time, I had always considered myself to be an old soul of sorts, as if I was older than my actual years allowed. I had lived in a small town in rural America, not small enough for everyone to know everyone but still small nonetheless, my life was rather unremarkable there and I always found myself wishing to escape from the monotony of the place. To do that I’d require money of course so I found work as a carpenter, the pay was never good but there was a certain satisfaction with the work that money couldn’t buy, but I made enough to live, go out with friends and generally enjoy the freedom of youth. Those days now seem all to run together, wake up late, work poorly and promise myself I’d do better the next day only to stay up late with friends and find myself in the same way again. We had a small classic diner in town, oftentimes we ate breakfast there but never really lunch or dinner, I can still taste the burgers and fries and I can still smell the eggs, hashbrowns and coffee. 

“What’ll you get?” asked Bobby peering at me over his glasses 

“Probably the same thing I always get” I replied still looking over the menu which I knew like the back of my hand. 

“Supposed to be a rainy day today, hope you brought coats” announced Steven.

“You know I brought mine boss, I always come prepared unlike dear Johnathan here” 

I ignored his comment, Bobby was a good guy but the only way he knew to show any sort of affection was teasing, if you didn’t know him you’d think him an arrogant ass. 

We sat together there for a while discussing the days events, what jobs we had lined up and how we’d complete them, Bobby teased me for how drunk I was the night before, I had barely begun to drink I told him. We had ate there many times, and were known by all the regular employees, most of them sweet old women just trying to make some extra spending money for themselves but today was different. One fact of life I’ve learned over my years is that big life changing events are never expected, it always happens on a usual Wednesday at work or a waking phone call in the middle of the night, the most pivotal moments in my life always came suddenly upon me and I was never the same after. 

“Its about time you got here, where have you been?” Asked the older woman whom I recognized as some sort of manager.

“Traffic was bad, I’m sorry” replied the girl who’d just walked in, I smiled because I knew there was no way traffic was bad this early in the morning. 

“What’re you smiling about?” Bobby said 

“Nothing, I just admire the courage to lie so openly”

“Well I’d hope you don’t lie at all, especially when it comes to why you’re always so late”  said Steven still looking at his paper and sipping his coffee. 

“Abe Lincoln would be jealous of Johnathan’s honesty boss” replied Bobby with his signature dumb smile,  I was still trying to listen to the conversation between the girl and her boss.

“You’ve made enough excuses, this is the third time this week” 

“I know, I’m sorry. I’ll do better” the girl said putting her head down in shame, it was a move I recognized from my own repertoire. I’d used it many times on Steven after me and Bobbys drunken adventures put me late into work and so I knew what would come next. As soon as the boss turned and walked away all shame and remorse disappeared from the girls eyes and body, her head straightened and her hair fell smoothly down her back again, about halfway down or so. She went to the back to get ready for her day.

“We’ve gotta finish the drywall work at the house on fifth, I wanted to get the shingles done on the yellow house on third but this rain killed that idea”

“We could always make Johnathan do it, worst case he falls and we have to hire someone who’ll actually show up on time” 

“I don’t know how you do it” I replied, “We drink the same and yet I can’t drag myself out of bed and you’re up early” 

“I’m simply just a stronger man, look at these” he flexed his biceps. 

“Doesn’t matter how early we’re up if we sit all day in this diner waiting on food” I said looking around wondering where my sausage biscuit could possibly be. I was hungry. 

“Burger with fries?” Here! Called Bobby “Who eats a burger for breakfast?” I asked. 

“A stronger man than you” he taunted back. The girl smiled to herself and slightly giggled, she didn’t want me to notice.

“Eggs, waffles and toast?”

 “Right here”, Steven said. “And when you can, some more coffee please”

“Of course, I’ll bring it right out, and a sausage biscuit with toast and bacon for you” She looked at me and I felt paralyzed, it took all my presence of mind to muster a simple “Thank you” 

“You’re welcome” she said as she walked to get the coffee. 

There was just something about her, she wasn’t necessarily the prettiest girl I’d ever seen but her brown eyes hidden under her loosely collected hair held a secret which i wished to know, her smiling face failed to conceal the painful life which she lived and I knew or at least suspected at that moment I’d have to get to know her more. My mind went to my love life, if there even was one. I was always a quiet shy person especially in school, sure I had talked to a few girls and I wasn’t a virgin but nothing true ever came from it. And at one point I think I decided to simply give up.

“Here’s that coffee” 

“Thanks” 

I watched her walk away, I had caught a glimpse of her name tag, something with E but she moved too quick, I looked at her ring finger also, not wanting to try and deprive some other fool of his woman.

“She’s new” I said as nonchalantly as I could as to not arouse Bobbys jokes.

“She’s slow, coffee should not take that long”

“Take it easy on Johnny boys new girlfriend boss, did you see the way he choked when she gave his food!” 

“Shut-up. Who is she anyway?”

“Hah I saw you checking her out as she left” 

“Maybe” I replied, stuffing my face with biscuit. “What would be so wrong with it if I did?” 

“Nothing at all, I’d just be happy for you to actually speak to a woman for once, instead of just glare”

“We can’t all be ladies men like you I guess” 

“There’s no one as cool as me” he replied.

We ate quickly and left to do our jobs for the day, every time she stepped out from the back I watched her, she had a few tables, for the most part she did a good job. I noticed her look our way a few times and she came by to check on us once or twice but I was sure she was just doing her job and not at all interested in me. The day was over before I knew it, it was a Friday so me and Bobby got our checks and walked to our vehicles.

“Bar hop tonight? I need to let off some steam” 

“Nah I think I’ll pass tonight, I need a night in to catch up on housework and some sleep if I’m lucky”

“Suit yourself, I’ll see you Monday.”

“See you”

I walked into my home, it was slightly cold so I turned on the electric heater and kicked my shoes off, I was tired and ready for the relaxation only home could provide. A while later I took a shower and opened a beer, not planning on going too far of course. But there was still the problem of dinner, I had neglected to get grocery’s through the week. The phone rang.

“Hello?”

“Johnathan, how are you?” It was my father, we’d never been too close but still called each other somewhat often.

“Doing good here, busy day at work today”.

“Thats good, better it be busy than having nothing to do”

We continued talking for abut a half an hour or so but eventually we both decided to hang up and go back to our separate lives. I was still hungry, a thought crossed my mind “I could go to the diner for some food” a burger sounded great. Of course in the back of my mind I wondered if she’d be there still, I figured not because it was so late but I got some clothes on and made my way to the diner. 

 It occurred to me on my way I had never eaten there alone, always with friends. But I suppose the pursuit of love will make us do things we never even considered. I walked through the door and it’s somewhat busy, a few locals we had done a job for and some truck drivers simply passing through. I took a seat.

“Hey you!” It was her, I hadn’t seen her when I walked in and she took me by surprise. 

“Once wasn’t enough, you had to come back for more huh? Where’s your friends?” 

“They’re my co-workers, I feel sorry for anyone who calls Bobby friend” I said feeling stupid as soon as I spoke.

“Awww he can’t be that bad. What can I get you to drink?” 

“I’ll take a Coke please”

“Alright, I’ll be right back with that and a menu.”

I sat there thinking, her name was Evelyn, I had got to look at her name tag. Her eyes had a look I knew all too well, a look I had seen countless times on my own face in the mirror, a look of dissatisfaction with life and the feeling of wasting the gift of youth. 

“Here’s that drink and a menu”

“I already know what I want”

“Oh ok, what can I get for you?”

“A cheeseburger, hold the onions and pickle please.”

“No onion?! Who doesn’t get onion on their burger?” She said smiling at me teasingly.

“I guess me?” I said, feeling awkward and knowing my face was turning red.

“Well ok, I’ll get this in for you, shouldn’t be long”

“Thanks”

 I sat there and waited, observing the other patrons. An old couple we’d built a fence for, an old grizzled trucker on his way to God knows where, a few other people occupied booths by themselves and then there was me. I was searching mind desperately for something to say to this girl but as it always is when you need something creative, the mind simply won’t cooperate, either way when I saw my food coming it wasn’t her.

“Burger no onion, no pickle?” 

“Thanks, where’d the other waitress go?”

“She gets off at eight” It was seven fifty so I figured she was doing her end of day duties and so had no time to bring my food out.

“She must be new?” I asked the waitress whom I recognized but I don’t believe recognized me.

“She is, been here for only about two weeks now, she’s single.” And with that my new waitress grinned at me with a knowing smile and walked away. 

I was slightly disappointed that the girl had left, but knew it’d more than likely lead nowhere even with my best lines or award winning smile, I simply lacked the confidence at that time. I ate and thought about several things, primarily my past relationships and how they all left me feeling so empty and worthless, I considered the strangeness of our desire for love and the pain it can bring and then I found myself wondering about the girl and her life, her story. I felt like a fool. Before i knew it I was done with my food, I had left a few fries but finished the burger, I paid and left a decent tip and walked out the door to my truck. I saw Evelyn in a small coupe; just sitting there lost in some deep contemplation, she looked tired. She looked up and saw me. 

“Uh hey” she said looking all too embarrassed, I was happy for her to be the embarrassed one now.

“Do you know anything about vehicles”

“A little, but I’m certainly no mechanic; what’s wrong?”

“I don’t know, it just won’t start” She tried to start it again. It was dead.

“Probably the battery, you may have left a light on or something; I have some cables we can jump it off.”

“You are a lifesaver” She said, “I don’t think I could spend another minute here.” 

“It’s no problem” I replied looking through my truck for the cables. After a minute or so I could not find them and realized I must’ve left them at home in my garage.

“Damn it. I took them out a few days ago and never put them back in; let me run home and I can come back and help.”

“How far away do you live?”

“Maybe ten minutes” I replied 

“Could I ride with you there?” She asked this question very sheepishly, like a child asking for a impulse candy purchase at the store, she was very aware of just how odd of a request it was and began to explain when she saw my face become puzzled. 

“It’s just that I don’t want to sit here and I don’t want to go back inside either” 

“Yeah I understand, you can ride with me if you want but I am a complete stranger to you” Times were different then but I still felt it odd she’d trust a complete stranger with a ride to an unknown place at a late hour. 

“I know but you look trustworthy enough, and we’re not necessarily complete strangers, you ate here this morning and the other waitresses said they knew you. And if you try anything I will put up a fight” 

“I’m sure you would, you have a fiery look in your eye” I said smiling “Let’s go then” She got in my truck as if it was hers, putting her purse down somewhat roughly on the floorboard beneath her. I pulled out of the restaurant parking lot and began the drive to my house, it was dark now and I turned on my high beams, the road was quiet and we didn’t speak for a minute but it felt like an eternity. She broke the silence. 

“So what do you do?” 

“I’m a construction worker, we do a lot of stuff around town”

“And those two this morning were your coworkers?” 

“Yeah, the older one is my boss and the younger, fatter one is Bobby. He’s a pretty good friend of mine” She giggled at my observation on Bobbys weight. 

“He’s a good guy, he just only knows how to tease” 

“I remember that this morning” She said smiling. “I don’t think I’ve seen you in there before?” 

“We’re in there pretty often for breakfast, so you must’ve just started” 

“Yeah about two weeks ago, its not bad. I like it except for my boss and the rude customers” 

“That’s why I like my job, Steven deals with the customers, I just stay quiet and do my work” 

“My names Evelyn by the way” She said after realizing we hadn’t even exchanged basic information  about ourselves.
