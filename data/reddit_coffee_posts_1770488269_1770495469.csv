1qyo5x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertsChat/comments/1qyo5x5/52m_not_as_old_as_it_seems/,52M - Not as old as it seems,"Somewhere out there is someone who understands the balance between solitude and connection, someone who feels deeply and still believes genuine friendship is worth searching for. I’m an introvert who loves quiet downtime at home but comes alive through travel, new experiences, and especially live music, where shared energy creates real connection. I value honest conversation, both light and deeply meaningful, and believe strong bonds grow through consistency, openness, and mutual effort. I’m looking for that rare “needle in the haystack”, someone who wants real connection, unfiltered stories, and the possibility of building something lasting together. I may be older, but I’m still curious, still chasing first experiences, and still approaching life with a kid-at-heart mindset. What matters most to me is simple: family, animals, music, coffee, travel, good food, and a willingness to keep exploring life.

It Started at 336 Hours. Now There’s One Left.,"If you ever hear an automated voice from the street calmly announcing the number of hours left until the end of the world, do not ignore it.

I know how that sounds. I tried to dismiss it the first time too, but then it kept coming back again and again. 

I don’t know how many of you have seen the van, or if anyone else can even hear what I’m hearing, but I need to explain myself before I don’t get the chance to at all. 

I’m not special, I’m the kind of guy you would pass on the street and not give a second glance to, but that’s what makes me worry even more. 

If something like this can happen to me, there’s no reason it can’t happen to you. 

My name is Carlos, and up until recently, I was just some guy trying to get through college, a full-time job, and a half-serious attempt at making music on the side when I have the time. I had routines, plans, dreams…but all of that was before I knew that every tomorrow was one step closer to ending a countdown.

For the past couple weeks, there’s been a white van that has driven slowly through my neighborhood in twelve-hour intervals. Once at 7:03 am, and the next at 7:03 pm like clockwork every day. Each time it passes, there’s a voice that comes from the speaker mounted on top. The message being spoken never changes, only the number does.

“This is an official announcement. You have 336 hours until the end of the world. You have 336 hours until the end of the world.”

That was what it said the first time I heard it half-asleep and standing in my kitchen waiting for my morning coffee to finish brewing. My ears only picked up on the cadence of the voice, not the actual words being spoken. 

The voice didn’t speak like a normal person would. It was monotonous yet polite. It’s the kind of voice that you would expect to hear from an automated phone menu except syllables are dragged out when they shouldn’t be and there are pauses throughout that are either abrupt or random.

I wrote it off as a test done by the city to see if their safety announcements were working, but when I heard the sentence repeat itself with the exact same tone and inflection, that’s when it clicked. I still get the chills thinking about the moment when I realized what it was that I was hearing.

I don’t have a whole lot of time left, and even worse, I don’t even know what exactly happens when the countdown reaches zero. All I know is that the closer it gets, the harder it is to trust my own reality.

If you’re reading this and you’ve seen the van, or if in the unfortunate event that you ever do, treat what I have written here in this post as a guide of sorts. This is what I’ve had to learn the hard way. I don’t know if any of this will necessarily save you, but it might buy you more time than I have remaining.

\\\*\\\*Do not assume other people can hear the announcement\\\*\\\*

The message is not a public broadcast, and it is not something that anybody else can hear. As far as I can tell, it is meant for you and you only.

I made the mistake of asking others what they heard the first few times the van had come by. Neighbors and strangers all told me the exact same thing, there was no voice or a van matching my description. Some of them said they only noticed an ice cream truck, others said they saw a utility vehicle, and some even claimed to have seen nothing at all. 

They just looked at me like I was clinically insane. One neighbor even began avoiding me completely after that, and I can’t necessarily say that I blame him for doing so. I mean, a stranger declaring that there’s a van announcing the end of the world is not exactly comforting in the slightest. 

That’s when I realized that the more I tried to explain it to people, the smaller my world actually felt.

If you’re hoping someone else can confirm what you’re hearing, don’t count on it. The more you continue to push the issue, the more isolated you’ll end up becoming. 

Save yourself the confusion, and more importantly, save yourself the doubt. Do not ask anyone else for reassurance. It will only make you question whether or not things are real.

\\\*\\\*Do not record the van’s announcement expecting proof\\\*\\\*

 

I thought about recording what I was seeing, and after days of feeling as though I was imagining things, I decided to go through with it. If I could just capture it once, I’d finally have something solid to point to. After all, a camera never lies, right? That’s what I initially thought too…until I realized that wasn’t true.

Recording the van doesn’t work like you think it would.

Every video I took on my phone either ended up a corrupted mess or it showed something completely normal. I’ve tried other devices too such as a laptop, a personal camera, and even a phone I’ve borrowed from a friend. Every single one of them has had an issue playing back the recording ranging from the audio being completely omitted to the video glitching out and cutting to black before the announcement would start.

Every attempt ended with the same result, nothing that proves what I saw or heard.

The worst part about it all wasn’t necessarily the failure, it was watching the recordings afterward and realizing that I can’t even show people what I’m talking about. If someone had come up to me and shown me those videos without knowing what they were talking about, I would’ve dismissed them without a second thought too.

Recording the van will not give you answers, it will only give you evidence that contradicts your own memory. Trying to document it is no different than asking someone else to confirm your experiences. Walk away with whatever certainty you have left because once that’s gone, you won’t get it back. 

\\\*\\\*Do not engage with the voice. It only provides updates, not answers to questions\\\*\\\*

The announcement is not an invitation for conversation. It doesn’t explain itself, it only declares its message and departs.

After the first few times the van had come by, I finally asked what it meant by its broadcast. The voice only repeated the announcement except much louder this time. What made it even stranger was that the harsh and distorted words felt invasive, like it was coming from inside my mind rather than outside.

I tried asking what it meant again another day, but the same thing happened.

The voice will not answer, argue, or bargain with you. It won’t clarify anything. The only thing it will do is finish speaking its message. 

Treat the announcement like a warning and not an explanation. It is not there to help you understand, its only goal is to remind you how much time you have left.

\\\*\\\*Do not check the time immediately after hearing the announcement\\\*\\\*

Do not look at a clock, your phone, a watch, or anything else that tracks time for at least a few minutes after the announcement ends. I cannot stress this enough.

It’s a mistake that will cost you precious time.

There was one time that I checked my phone a moment after the van passed by without thinking. When I looked up from my phone, six hours had gone by.

All that time had passed in the blink of an eye.

I was standing in the same spot, holding my phone, but the light outside had changed and my body felt incredibly sore for some reason.

The van’s schedule never changes; it arrives at the same times every day. The countdown is the only thing that accelerates. Whatever time you lose is taken directly from the number being announced, not the time of the real world.

Ever since I’ve made that connection, I make sure to hide anything that tells time before the van’s arrival. I don’t check until the street has fallen completely silent and the van is long gone. I’m not sure how long you’re supposed to wait, only that it’s best to keep time out of sight and out of mind.

I know it’s easier said than done but you need to do this. Preserve every second as there is no way to get back that time you lose.

\\\*\\\*Write things down by hand if you need to remember them\\\*\\\*

Your memory will not be reliable for long. What will start off as easily dismissible gaps in time will turn into missed conversations, plans you can’t remember agreeing to, and entire hours lost and unaccounted for.

With so much going on in my life, writing things down in my agenda book is something that feels second nature to me. I didn’t expect something so mundane to become a survival mechanism. Don’t second-guess yourself because anything you don’t physically write down is at risk of slipping away.

I’ve tried using reminders on my phone such as notes apps and scheduled emails to myself, but technology isn’t reliable. 

My notes would always end up deleted and emails would arrive later than when I knew I had scheduled them.

Technology is easily corrupted but by what exactly is uncertain.

If you need to remember something, write it down yourself and keep it somewhere you’ll see it often. Read it regularly to remind yourself of what you plan to do and what you already know.

If you don’t, you’ll start relying on a memory that would rather betray you than tell the truth.

\\\*\\\*Stay within familiar areas\\\*\\\*

Don’t think you’re clever enough to avoid the van by leaving before it arrives, it’s not as easy as you might think. 

I tried to do that once. Just before the scheduled 7:03 am announcement, I got in my car and drove wherever new streets could take me. Places I’d never been before and thought I could find refuge in even for a little bit.

But it was all in vain.

The van still found me and gave the announcement exactly on time. But what was peculiar was that when it spoke, everything around me changed. 

Streets stretched endlessly towards the horizon, turns repeated themselves in nauseating twists and knots, and buildings that I had passed not even moments prior had seemingly vanished without a trace. 

The GPS app on my phone kept reconfiguring or never settling on a route entirely. Technology only confirmed my worst fear in that moment, I had no idea where I was.

Eventually though, my surroundings did return to normal. But even at this exact moment, I still don’t entirely trust the outside world when the van is near.

Unfamiliar places don’t protect you; they only expose you more. The less you recognize your surroundings, the harder it becomes to tell how far you’ve gone or how long you’ve been gone for.

You cannot outrun the van or hide from it. It will always arrive to deliver its message whether you are ready or not.

It is for that reason that it is important to stay somewhere where you can anchor yourself to what’s real. 

Anything unfamiliar will only give it more chances to take time from you. 

\\\*\\\*Do not try to follow the van\\\*\\\*

Following the van doesn’t solve anything so don’t do it under any circumstance. I thought that if I could just trail it long enough, I might learn where it came from or where it goes after the announcements end.

I was wrong.

If you try to follow the van, you won’t find answers.

You have better luck winning the lottery multiple times than to successfully follow the van. 

It always remains just far enough ahead that you can’t quite catch up no matter how fast you go. If you do somehow manage to get somewhat close to it, the van will just turn a corner and be gone.

The longer you follow it, the more you feel like you’re chasing a ghost.

Do not follow the van, but if you ignore my warning for some reason then I implore you to pay very close attention to the one that comes next.

\\\*\\\*Do not approach the van if it has come to a full stop\\\*\\\*

There was one time when the van stopped completely outside my house.

It didn’t stall or pull over and park next to the curb, it just came to complete halt in the middle of the street after it finished its announcement. 

I went outside to investigate and heard the engine was still running but couldn’t get a proper look inside the vehicle. When I got closer, I heard the driver’s side door creak open slightly.

I thought someone was finally going to step out and confront me. After all this time, I assumed that was the point of all this. This one interaction could have been the answer to getting an explanation for everything.

Could have been.

Instead, when I got closer, the door swung open without warning and hit me square in the face with a metallic clunk. I remember the sudden warmth of blood dripping down my busted nose as I cried out in pain.

Before I could even react or get a grip of my spinning surroundings, the door slammed shut and the van sped off, disappearing down the boulevard.

Before all of that happened, I was able to get a good look inside, but it left me feeling only more bewildered.

There wasn’t anybody behind the wheel of the van nor was there even an impression in the driver’s seat. The only thing I saw was an empty front cabin as if the van didn’t need anyone to operate it.

If you’re trying to figure out who’s responsible for this, don’t. You won’t find anybody who can or will provide the answers that you’re looking for. That’s not what the van does. It only stops to remind you that it is the sole controller of the distance between you and it.

Do not approach the van if it stops. 

The closer you get, the more you risk putting yourself in physical danger.

That’s not something you want.

\\\*\\\*Do not involve those you care about\\\*\\\*

Don’t bring people you trust into this thinking you can find solace in their reassurance. I tried to tell friends. Family, co-workers, anyone that I thought might listen long enough to help me make sense of what was happening, but none of them believed me.

My concerns were laughed away or written off as the product of a lack of sleep. A few people did genuinely try to be kind about it, but their only suggestion was that I seek therapeutic help. No one ever seemed to take me seriously.

I wish I hadn’t ever brought it up to anybody because after I talked about the van to others, the announcement changed slightly.

After it told me how much time I had left, the voice began adding details it never had before such as names and addresses. Things it shouldn’t have known unless it had known the entire time I was explaining myself to others. 

They were all delivered in the same monotonous, automated tone like the rest of the messages that had come before. 

It didn’t threaten them outright, but it didn’t have to. Hearing the names alone was enough to understand the implications of what it meant.

This isn’t something you share, this is something you’re forced to carry alone. 

The second you decide to get someone else involved, they become part of the countdown whether they believe you or not.

If you care about anyone at all, keep them out of this. Stop talking and quit explaining yourself. Distance yourself from everyone however you have to. Let others think you’re unreliable, dramatic, or have gone off the grid.

It’s better than hearing the van speak the names of others and knowing that you’re the one who put them in danger.

\\\*\\\*Do not ask what happens at zero\\\*\\\*

I don’t recall exactly how I phrased the question, only that the words slipped out before I could stop myself. 

The announcement was halfway through its usual loop when I spoke, and for the first time, it didn’t finish its sentence.

I don’t remember anything that came after that. All I know is that I was standing on my front porch when it started, and then I wasn’t there when it ended. Everything in between feels like a gap my mind refuses to fill.

What I do remember is that in the days following, I didn’t sleep. When I finally did, the nightmares were worse than being awake. I’m not sure how to describe exactly what I saw, but I remember the feeling of reaching zero and realizing it wasn’t an ending at all.

Do not ask what happens at zero because whatever answer exists is not meant to be remembered.

I need anybody else who has experienced this to tell me what happens when it reaches zero.

Does the world actually end or does it just end for whoever listens to the message? 

The van said I had twelve hours left this morning. 

It’s been eleven hours since then. 

Please…time is running out for me.

If this post buys you more time than it bought me, then don’t waste a single second of it. 

I don’t know if I can save you. 

I don’t know if I can save anyone. 

The only thing I know is that I can no longer save myself.

If you’re still reading this and the countdown hasn’t reached zero, then maybe you’ll hear from me again. 

Or maybe you won’t. 

I don’t really know anymore… 

I don’t have much longer left to know.",1,1770495356.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qyo0j5,https://i.redd.it/zclqcz3rq4ig1.jpeg,February 12th is my birthday,"February 12th is my birthday. Each Birthday is a year to reflect on what has happened and what changes will be made to improve things moving forward. 

2025 almost sent me to meet JESUS in Heaven in person. Toward the end of the year demons are in a rage as they must meet their quotas of death and destruction by the end of the year. Unfortunately, Satan tried kill me twice. Once with hernia-like symptoms that caused me to have difficulty breathing. I went to my church and an elder layed hands on me and I was instantly healed, praise JESUS (James 5:14-16).

About 3 weeks later i went to the health clinic looking for a breathing treatment that I thought was asthma or bronchitis. The condition facing me was much worse than that. After being formally hospitalized I was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure.

 While I believe this was a spiritual attack of retaliation for all the people who are being helped by HowToBeHealedTV; it appears I made it easy for Satan to attack me by drinking Energy Drinks so I could work 10-15 hours a day. Energy Drinks ran my Blood Pressure too high for too long. If you don't know Coffee Kills as well. 

A doctor I know personally looked at my chart and said, I also wasnt eating enough protein. Red Meat and Processed Food is horrible for heart disease and high blood pressure so I was already avoiding those foods. GOD sent 3 people to tell me to eat some meat and there was an emphasis on Salmon. I am now eating more Plant Based Protein Shakes, Eggs, Goats Milk and  Salmon.

I am also eating more Iron-rich plant foods, plus Iron supplements and Teas of Iron Rich plants. 

My heart stopped twice at two different times but im happy to tell you that GOD is a Healer and Sustainer. Its so important to daily read Healing Scriptures before you need them. One of the diagnosis ""Tachycardia"" has already been reversed and Healed.

I will use all the Biblical Instructions, Nutritional Protocals and Lifestyle tools for Health available while  utilizing these Pharmaceutical Drugs (medicine) the doctor prescribed to help give me more time to fix the underlying problems. I am also taking about 80+ Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs and Superfood that has been traditionally used to fight these condition. There are probably only 10 super important supplements but I hope to go into greater detail of my recovery in a future article or video.

Needless to say I am no longer working in the secular workforce as I recover from this condition.  I am still working for JESUS as I can do my ministerial duties by phone,hold 1 on 1 Bible Studies by phone or Zoom and visit people in the hospital.

Im asking for UnCeasing Prayer, all day, on my behalf or as much as your capacity allows with your other tasks and goals will allow. 

I will live and not die and declare the works of the LORD (Psalm 118:17). And I decree and declare the demons that killed my ancestors (obesity, gluttony, etc) will not kill me. 

I dont believe in celebrating my birthday or begging for money. However, according reports: less than 20% of the U.S. Christians pay tithes or  even give offerings. So typically people wont support ministries like mine that has facilitated over 115 documented Physical Healings, over 50 documented Prosperity Miracles where people got jobs around $100,000, several Salvations,  ReDedications and cast and unknown amount of demons out of peoppe, not to mentiong other forms of Breakthrough. This is the fruit that this ministry has produced because of JESUS' Sacrifice. On the other hand people typically will send $100 to celebrate a Birthday.

1qynyvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qynyvg/we_camped_where_the_road_maintenance_ends/,We Camped Where the Road Maintenance Ends. Something Followed Us Home.,"We picked the mountains because they were empty.

That’s what Dylan said when he dropped a pin on my phone earlier that week. No campground name. No trailhead. Just a GPS point on a ridge above a dead-end forest road. He’d found it on satellite at work, zoomed in until the trees were a textured green smear and the road looked like a scar running uphill.

If I’d known I’d end up calling 911 because my best friend was tapping on my second-floor window, I would’ve deleted that pin and gone to bed like a normal person.

“Two nights,” Dylan said. “No people. No kids with Bluetooth speakers. No ‘reserved site’ signs. Just us.”

I should’ve pushed back. I didn’t. The last month had been a pileup of small problems that all demanded attention at once—late fees, meetings, sleep that never felt like it counted. I wanted to be somewhere that didn’t ask anything from me.

We left Friday after work. Dylan rode shotgun with his boots on the dash and a grocery bag of snacks he swore were “trail essential.” I packed like I always do: extra water, a first-aid kit, a cheap emergency beacon I’d bought after a missing hiker story and never activated, and a roll of athletic tape that lived in my glove compartment like a superstition. My truck still had that faint old-coffee smell ground into the fabric seats, and the dashboard clock was five minutes fast because I’d gotten tired of being late.

Dylan mocked me for the gear for the first twenty minutes, which was normal. He mocked my playlists too, which was also normal.

The highway thinned into a two-lane, then a narrower county road, then finally a forest road with ruts deep enough to knock your teeth together. Trees tightened on both sides. The light changed when we started climbing and the sun dipped behind the ridge line.

Dylan checked his phone, lifted it toward the windshield like that helps.

“No service,” he said, smiling like it was a reward.

We passed a white metal sign half bent on its post. The letters were faded but readable.

NO MAINTENANCE BEYOND THIS POINT.

“Cute,” Dylan said. “They say that so people don’t sue when they pop a tire.”

“Or so people don’t go past it,” I said.

He pointed out the window like I was being dramatic. “We’re already past it.”

The road climbed for another forty minutes. No houses. No driveways. No other cars. Just trees, switchbacks, and washouts I had to crawl through in first gear. At one point I realized the little roadside reflectors had stopped. No red “eyes” catching the headlights. Just dirt and dark.

When we reached the pull-off Dylan had pinned, it wasn’t a campsite. It was just a widened patch of dirt where someone had turned around at some point. A narrow game trail cut from the pull-off into brush and climbed toward the ridge.

Dylan swung his pack onto his shoulders like he’d been there before.

“There,” he said.

We hiked up, not talking much because the incline made you choose between conversation and breathing. The trail was packed dirt with deer prints and scat. I noticed the prints without thinking. Deer, rabbit, something heavier. I didn’t assign it meaning. It was just data.

When we hit the ridge, the view opened hard—layers of mountains stacked out into haze. It was pretty in a blunt way. Dylan stood there, arms out like he was showing off a house he bought.

“Tell me this isn’t worth it,” he said.

“It’s worth it,” I admitted.

We found a flat-ish spot between two pines. Enough room for a tent and enough cover that you couldn’t see the road below unless you walked to the edge. Dylan liked that. He always liked feeling tucked away, like being hidden made you safer.

We set up camp on autopilot: tarp, tent, poles, stakes. Sleeping pads inside. Stove on a flat rock. Lantern hung from a branch. Dylan talked while he worked, complaining about his job, about his boss, about how he wanted to “unplug.” I half listened, more focused on the small stuff—where the wind came from, where water would run if it rained, what the ground looked like around the tent.

There were tracks around our site. Deer, mostly. A few that could’ve been coyote or dog. One set near a patch of soft dirt made me pause. The imprint was messy, not crisp. Four long toe marks and something like a thumb drag, like the foot had rolled weirdly.

I didn’t say anything. It wasn’t enough. Tracks rarely are.

We ate when the sun started to go. Instant noodles and jerky and Dylan’s “trail essentials,” which were mostly candy and chips. The temperature dropped fast after dark. My breath started showing. We pulled jackets on and leaned toward the stove for warmth. The smell of fuel mixed with pine and cold dirt.

For the first couple hours, it was exactly what we wanted—quiet, dull, normal. Dylan told stories about people we went to school with. I laughed because some of them were still funny. We both stared into the trees sometimes because you can’t help it.

Then a voice carried up from below the ridge.

Not loud. Not urgent. Just one word, drawn out, like someone testing whether sound would travel.

“Hellooo?”

Dylan froze with his fork halfway to his mouth.

We looked at each other.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered, like whispering mattered.

“Yeah.”

“Who would be up here?”

I stood and stepped away from the stove, listening. No second call. No footsteps. Just wind high up and the smaller noises of brush shifting.

“Probably someone on the road,” Dylan said, but his eyes stayed fixed on the dark slope below us.

“They’d have to be past the sign,” I said.

“Everybody’s past the sign,” he muttered.

I didn’t like how the voice had sounded. Not frightened. Not annoyed. Flat. Like the word itself was the point, not the answer.

We kept eating anyway. You don’t want to feed your own nerves if you can help it.

Fifteen minutes later, another voice rose from the same general direction.

A woman this time, softer, like she didn’t want to shout.

“Can you help me?”

Dylan’s eyes widened. The fork clinked off the metal cup in his hand.

I cupped my hands and yelled back.

“WHERE ARE YOU?”

My voice hit the trees and died. No answer.

Dylan stood and stepped closer to me. “We’re not going down there.”

“We can keep calling,” I said.

We did. Twice more. No response, no follow-up, nothing like “I’m hurt” or “I’m lost.” Just those two lines dropped into the dark and then nothing.

Dylan tried to joke. “Maybe it’s a couple messing around.”

“Out here?” I said.

He opened his mouth like he had an answer, then shut it.

Something moved in the brush to our left. Not crashing. Not running. Just a shift, like weight settling.

Dylan took a step back toward the tent.

I clicked my headlamp on and swept the beam across the trees.

It caught trunks, ferns, the flash of a pale rock. Then it hit something low behind a fallen log—an outline that my brain tried to label as deer and failed.

The head lifted.

Two eyes reflected back in the beam, bright points. Too high for how low the body was.

It moved again, and the way it moved made my stomach tense. Not smooth. Not cautious. Like it was choosing a posture on purpose and not quite fitting into it.

The outline changed as it shifted, longer limbs showing, joints bending at angles that didn’t match what I expected.

Then it ducked behind the log so cleanly it was like it had practiced hiding.

Dylan whispered, “Did you see it?”

“Yeah.”

“What was it?”

“I don’t know.”

We stood there another minute, scanning. Nothing showed itself again. No more voices. The night went back to being quiet and cold and full of trees.

We cleaned up and packed food away. I hung the dry bag on cord over a branch, far enough from the tent that it wouldn’t be right on top of us. Dylan kept his headlamp moving constantly like he was afraid to leave any patch of darkness unlit.

When we crawled into the tent, the nylon walls felt thinner than they should. Every zipper sound felt too loud. We lay there with our sleeping bags pulled up to our shoulders, listening.

Dylan said, “You think it was a sick deer? Mange?”

“Deer don’t crouch behind logs,” I said.

He exhaled hard. “Cool.”

A while passed. Minutes. Time has no shape in a tent when you’re waiting.

Then slow footsteps began outside.

Not heavy. Not stomping. Just deliberate steps around the perimeter of our site—leaves shifting, a twig bending, then a pause. Another step. Another pause.

Dylan sat up so fast the tent creaked.

“It’s right there,” he whispered.

I killed my headlamp. Light inside the tent would make us a bright rectangle from outside.

We listened. The steps moved from one side of the tent to the back.

Then they stopped.

A pause long enough that my chest started to ache from holding air.

Then, right outside the tent, a voice spoke.

It sounded like Dylan.

“Hey,” it said, in Dylan’s lazy tone. “You awake?”

Dylan snapped his head toward me so fast I heard his neck pop slightly.

“That wasn’t me,” he mouthed.

My stomach dropped. The kind of drop you feel before a car accident you can’t avoid.

The voice came again, closer.

“C’mon, man,” it said. “Let me in.”

Dylan put a hand over his mouth, like he was scared his body would answer automatically.

Outside, something scraped against the nylon—soft at first, then a little harder.

Not a tear. A drag. Like fingernails testing.

The voice shifted abruptly, like someone turning a dial.

Now it sounded like a woman, but the cadence was wrong, clipped and repeated.

“Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.”

Same sentence, same rhythm.

Then silence.

No footsteps walking away. No movement.

Just… nothing, right outside the wall.

My lungs burned. Dylan’s breathing was stuck, shallow and high.

After maybe thirty seconds, the footsteps resumed—slow steps moving away down the slope until they faded into normal night noise.

Neither of us slept after that in any real sense. We drifted in and out, listening, checking the zipper with our fingertips like it might move on its own.

At dawn we stepped outside.

Five shallow scratches ran down the nylon near the zipper. Not deep enough to rip. Deep enough to rough the fabric.

Tracks circled the tent. In the soft dirt near the entrance, impressions that looked like long fingers pressed down hard, splayed. Then a dragging mark, like weight shifting awkwardly. The pattern stopped near the zipper, then moved away.

Dylan stared, face pale.

“Tell me I’m not seeing hands,” he said.

“You’re seeing something like hands,” I said.

We ate quick. Not a real breakfast, just enough to put something in our stomachs. Dylan kept looking down the slope.

“We should check,” he said finally. “If someone’s actually out there—if those voices were real—”

I stared at him. “We’re not splitting up.”

“I’m not saying split,” he said. “I’m saying… just look around. Ten minutes. Then we leave.”

My instincts wanted to pack and go. But his logic wasn’t insane. People get lost. People get hurt. And we’d yelled into the dark and gotten nothing back.

So we took the minimum: headlamps, water, my knife, Dylan’s small hatchet. We left camp mostly intact and started down the slope toward where the footsteps and voices had been.

The hillside was uneven and the brush was thick. The further down we went, the more the trees closed in. It wasn’t dark—sunlight still came through—but the light was broken into strips and patches that made it hard to get a clean look at anything more than twenty feet away.

The “trail” turned into small signs: disturbed leaves, scuffs in soil, branches bent in a way that didn’t match wind. What bothered me was the lack of consistency. In one patch of mud I saw something that looked like a deer print. Ten feet later, something like a dog. Then a smear, and then what looked like long toes pressed deep.

“It’s like it’s switching,” Dylan said under his breath.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t want to make that idea bigger by naming it.

We found a deer carcass first—mostly bone, fur still attached in patches. Coyotes do that. Bears do that.

But this didn’t look dragged or scattered by feeding. The parts were pulled into a shallow depression and left there. Like someone had moved them into place.

Dylan crouched, face tight. “This is messed up.”

I was about to tell him we should turn back when something snapped behind us.

Not a loud crack. A clean, sharp sound, like a dry branch giving under weight.

Dylan and I both turned at the same time.

The brush behind us shifted. I saw a shape, low and still, like it had dropped into a crouch the second it knew we were looking.

I raised my headlamp without thinking, clicked it on, and swept the beam.

The light hit nothing.

Then, for a fraction of a second, it hit an arm.

Not a foreleg. An arm—long, pale, too thin, with a hand that had fingers that looked stretched.

It pulled back behind a tree trunk fast.

Dylan’s voice came out thin. “Nope. Nope. We go.”

We turned uphill.

That’s when it hit us.

Not from in front. From the side, like it had moved parallel with us and waited for the moment we committed to turning.

It came out of the brush in a fast, wrong burst—low, then high, then low again—changing posture mid-motion like it couldn’t decide what shape it wanted to be while it moved.

I saw gray skin in patches. A ridge of hair down its back like a sick dog. The head was the worst part because my brain kept trying to read it as something familiar and failing. It looked like it had the outline of a deer’s skull and the wrong kind of face tucked under it.

Dylan swung the hatchet instinctively. He didn’t connect. The thing slid back, then forward again.

Its hand—too long—caught my left forearm as I pushed past Dylan.

It didn’t grab like a person. It hooked.

A sharp pain shot up my arm. I felt fabric tear, then the warm slip of blood. It wasn’t one cut. It was multiple lines at once, like a rake dragged across skin.

I yelled, a hard sound that didn’t even feel like my voice.

Dylan swung again, wider. The blade hit something—bone or shoulder or whatever counted as shoulder—and the impact made a dull, heavy sound.

The thing jerked back like it didn’t expect resistance.

It didn’t scream.

It made a wet exhale, like breath pushed through a throat that didn’t have the right shape for it.

Then it moved—fast, sideways, into brush—vanishing in two seconds like it had never been there.

Dylan grabbed my arm. “You okay?”

I looked down. Blood ran from four long scratches, soaking my sleeve. The skin around it burned hot.

“I’m fine,” I said automatically, because that’s what you say.

“You’re not fine,” Dylan snapped. “We’re done. We’re done.”

We climbed fast. My arm throbbed. Every time my sleeve brushed the open lines it stung hard. The whole time, I kept expecting the brush to explode again. It didn’t.

When we broke back into camp, my stomach tightened.

The food bag was gone.

The cord still hung from the branch, cut clean. Not snapped. Not chewed. Cut.

Dylan stared up at the dangling cord.

“It cut it,” he said.

I moved to the tent, checked zippers. Closed. No one inside. Then I saw what had been placed near the entrance.

A strip of denim folded neatly on a flat rock like an offering.

Old blood stained it dark.

Dylan’s face went gray. “That’s mine.”

“It can’t be,” I said.

He yanked up his pant leg. His jeans were intact. No missing piece. No tear.

He stared at his leg like he expected it to change anyway.

“I didn’t bring an extra pair,” he said.

I picked up the denim with two fingers. It was stiff. The blood was dry.

My arm pulsed again, like it wanted to remind me this wasn’t a camp story.

We packed like our hands belonged to someone else. No neat folding. Tent down fast, shoved into its bag wrong. Gear thrown into the truck bed. Straps tightened with shaking fingers.

Dylan kept scanning the treeline. His headlamp flicked on even though it was day.

I slammed the tailgate. The sound echoed.

A soft click came from the brush beyond our site. A branch snap under careful weight.

I turned.

Partially behind a tree trunk, a face showed itself.

Not fully. Just enough.

Pale skin stretched too tight across bone in places. Patches of hair in areas that didn’t match any animal I knew. Eyes that weren’t animal eyes and didn’t settle as human either.

It stared at us without blinking.

Then the mouth moved.

In Dylan’s voice, it said very softly, very clearly:

“Don’t go.”

Dylan grabbed my injured arm without thinking and I hissed.

“Drive,” he said.

I didn’t hesitate. I got in, started the engine. Tires kicked dirt as I reversed too fast, the truck fishtailing slightly before I corrected and pointed downhill.

We didn’t stop until we reached the first place that had people—a gas station with a diner attached and a couple cars out front. Fluorescent lights. A bell on the door. The smell of coffee and fryer oil.

Normal.

We walked in looking like we’d been in a fight, which wasn’t far off. My sleeve was soaked. I’d wrapped it with gauze and tape in the truck, but it still bled through.

The guy behind the counter looked up. Gray beard, tired eyes. He saw my arm and my face and didn’t ask if we wanted cigarettes or bait. He just said, “You boys come off that forest road?”

Dylan nodded too fast. “Yeah. We need—”

I said, “We need to call the sheriff. And I need… something to clean this.”

The man didn’t argue. He didn’t laugh. He reached under the counter and pulled out a corded landline handset, dialed without looking. While it rang, he stared at Dylan and said, “You went past the maintenance sign.”

“Yes,” Dylan said.

The man nodded once, like that was the only confirmation he needed.

A woman in a diner apron came through the back carrying a crate of cups. She took one look at my arm, then at Dylan’s face, and stopped.

“Another one?” she asked quietly.

The man spoke into the phone in a low voice, turned partly away. I caught pieces: “two campers… ridge pull-off… injury… voices…” He hung up and looked back.

“Sheriff’ll come,” he said. “You tell it straight. No jokes. No guesses.”

The woman set the crate down carefully and looked at my arm.

“What did it do?” she asked.

I pulled the sleeve back enough to show the scratches. Four long lines. Swollen edges already rising.

Her face tightened. “Throw that jacket out,” she said. “Bag it. Don’t keep it.”

“Why?” Dylan demanded.

The man answered. “Because it’s not about infection. It’s about attention.”

The sheriff came. He was polite and tired and moved like someone who’d been pulled away from paperwork. He asked for names, dates, where exactly we were. He took photos of my arm and asked if we’d seen anyone else.

When we told him about the voices and the thing copying Dylan, he didn’t grin. He didn’t dismiss it. He wrote it down with a tight jaw and gave us a case number.

He said, “Don’t go back.”

Then he added, “And if either of you sees the other somewhere you shouldn’t be—don’t assume it’s a good surprise.”

I went to urgent care the next day. I told the nurse I got scraped on brush. She cleaned it, gave me antibiotics “just in case,” and asked if I’d had a tetanus shot in the last ten years. I said yes. She wrote that down. She wrapped my arm and told me to watch for redness traveling up the limb.

The scratches healed slower than I expected. The swelling took days to go down. Near my wrist there was a bruised patch in a shape that suggested a thumb, like something had tried to grip like a person and didn’t know where the thumb belonged.

Dylan texted me once that week: you good?

I texted back: arm sucks but i’m fine. you?

He replied: no. can’t stop hearing it.

After that he went quiet.

Four nights after we got back, I heard knocking.

Not on my door.

On my living room window.

My apartment is on the second floor. The lot behind the building slopes upward, so if you stand near the retaining wall out back you’re closer to my window than you should be. That’s why my brain didn’t immediately file it under “impossible.” It tried to give it the benefit of physics.

Three taps. Even spacing.

I sat up in bed so fast my shoulder popped. My heart was pounding hard enough that my throat felt tight.

The knock came again. Three taps. Same rhythm.

No footsteps in the hall. No neighbor voices. Just tapping on glass.

Then a voice through the window, muffled, close.

“Hey,” Dylan said. “Open up.”

My body went cold.

It sounded like Dylan. Not similar. Dylan.

I moved into the hallway without turning lights on. I checked my front door peephole.

Hallway empty.

The tapping came again.

“C’mon,” Dylan’s voice said. “I forgot my keys.”

Dylan lives across town. Dylan doesn’t come to my place late and tap on windows. Dylan also doesn’t forget his keys and then choose the least normal way to solve that.

The tapping slowed. Three taps became one. Then a pause.

“Please,” Dylan said.

It wasn’t panic. It was placement. Like the word itself was the tool.

“Please,” it said again, softer. “I’m hurt.”

My forearm pulsed under the bandage.

I backed away from the peephole and called Dylan. Not text. Call. If he answered sleepy and annoyed, I could breathe again.

It rang once.

Twice.

He answered, real voice, thick with sleep.

“What.”

Relief hit me hard.

“Where are you,” I whispered.

“In bed,” he mumbled. “Why are you calling—”

The tapping on my window stopped.

At the exact second Dylan answered, it stopped like someone lifted their hand away.

I said, “Don’t hang up.”

Dylan woke up fully in the space of a breath. “What’s wrong.”

“I hear you at my window,” I said.

There was a pause on the line. Not disbelief. Recognition.

“Oh my god,” Dylan whispered. “It’s doing it to you.”

He said, fast, “Don’t open anything. Don’t talk to it. Call the cops.”

“It’s quiet,” I whispered.

“That doesn’t mean it left.”

I went to the living room without turning on lights. The window was a black rectangle. The blinds were down but not perfectly—small gaps.

I leaned toward one gap.

Someone’s face was pressed close to the glass, close enough that a small patch fogged.

It looked like Dylan at first glance. Same hoodie. Same hairline. Same cheekbones.

For half a second my brain tried to accept it, because acceptance is easier than fear.

Then it smiled.

Too wide. Too practiced.

And the eyes caught the dim light inside my living room and reflected it back the way a deer’s eyes do when headlights hit them.

It lifted a hand.

Tapped once, gently.

The fingernail was too long.

On the phone, Dylan whispered, “What do you see.”

I backed away hard enough to hit the wall.

“I’m calling 911,” I said.

I did. I told dispatch someone was at my second-floor window. I gave my address, unit number, and said I’d been threatened. I didn’t add anything that would get me labeled as “paranoid” in the first thirty seconds.

Dylan stayed on the line while we waited.

“Stay away from the window,” he kept repeating. “If you hear me outside, it’s not me.”

Police arrived in about nine minutes. Two officers. Flashlights. Their faces had that default irritation until they saw my wrapped arm and how my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

They checked outside. They checked the slope behind the retaining wall. They looked for footprints in the wet grass. They looked for anything that suggested a person had been standing under my window long enough to tap.

They found nothing.

No shoe prints. No disturbed ground. No broken stems. Nothing.

One officer looked up at my window, then down again.

“There should be some kind of mark,” he said. Not accusing. Just baffled.

They took a report. They asked if I had a camera. I did—a cheap doorbell cam on the front door that only covered the hallway and the entry.

We checked it anyway.

No one came to my door. No one passed my hallway. No shadows. No movement.

They gave me a report number and told me to call again if it returned.

They left.

Dylan stayed on the phone until I promised I wasn’t opening anything and wasn’t going outside.

After we hung up, I sat on my couch with every light on until sunrise.

I didn’t hear tapping again that night.

But around 5:40 a.m., when the sky started to go from black to dark gray, there was one last sound from the living room window.

Not tapping.

A slow scrape, like a fingernail dragged down glass.

One line.

Then another beside it.

Then another.

Five parallel scratches that made my teeth hurt just hearing them.

I didn’t go near the window until full daylight.

There was nothing on the outside of the glass. No scratches. No residue. No prints.

But on the inside—on the dust that always collects along the bottom edge of the window frame—there were faint marks, like fingertips pressed and dragged slightly.

Long, narrow impressions that didn’t match my hand.

I vacuumed them up.

I bagged the vacuum canister and threw it out like a crazy person.

And I started doing something I never did before all of this: when my phone rings, I let it ring until I can place the person in my head—where they are, what they’d be doing, whether the timing makes sense.

Because I learned the hard way that a familiar voice doesn’t prove anything.

It’s just a sound something else can practice.",2,1770494930.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

  It's always a little gloomy waking up knowing that everything in your life is complimenting an exact formulation of predictable. Wake up sit around a few minutes.. a few hours.. until you decide it's time to walk over to the 10 o'clock bus, sure not to plan ahead because that would ruin the disappointment of missing it, and I always did. So I take my normal detour around to get coffee or some type of pick me up to aid me in my droning of the day, near motionless existence meandering toward inevitable death, its a curiosity, I'm sure, to observer's why I haven't picked up a drug habit, an upper that would keep me afloat through my oceans of sorrow, funny how people can destroy your escape routes. Pacing in a convenient store while sober during a circumstance that's cocooned your social parameters, like words sticking to your body from an unknown source, the passing of a tattoo ghost artist bent on telling their story in the physical plane one final time before his rest, titling for passerby's to easily weigh significance and generate their individual investments. Do I get something to eat? Is it worth it in my dying state? Dying? 33, and I could count how many days I've spent on this earth in fractions of the time I've spent on it, words like poison to a newborn destined for nothingness, where would the fight begin child? And where would it end? It hasn't always been like this. No. Before I was sacrificed, I had plan's for a bright future for a large amount of people. A job, working toward a place I could call home, a car I could call mine, a workspace I could mold my life into something worthy of the love I've always wanted to see in the world. From artistries, fun escapades, a small glimpse into the future taken into the present, I was going to be apart of something great. I suppose you have to watch where you step. Or rather who you step near, our temperament's are forged from the molten core of the Earth itself, a world we have no real control over, maybe that's why we all struggle for a position of power? How much can we control before we die. I would think someone with a mind like that would find themselves trying to manipulate people as well. Can't be all that far away from what happened to me. 



It all hit me in waves, like radiation poisoning from devastating nuclear forces that would seal my demise. A slow process of manipulation and adulations within the inner workings of a tree, life itself, the cell's receiving a signal to move and work to build or rebuild. I suppose that's our recycling of history the circle of life coming back around to place you in the small of the worlds eye, to remind me that I am nothing. A mistake in the linear wanderings of an infant determined to learn and understand the world around. I suppose looking at the past and complaining about life happening, how long does it take to make rationality justified, loss from war and selfish sacrifice, the possible delusions of mad minds or hungry stomachs. When did civility become a debility? Social circumstances would provide us the delicate structure we need in order to be successful, a safety in the community proposal, of trades and barters within a market space. Utilize it well and find yourself reaching pinnacles of traversable space.\[( But this story begins as a synapse within the mind of a teenage dirt bag like me. ""Dude! I forgot to comb my hair again!"", ""Darn it Billy your always so rebellious!"", ""Fuck you dad, little bitch, and by the way I quit the tetherball team!"" (takes a heavy swig of milk), "".."" (a look of confusion and sadness on the father's face.) , ""This is why mom left you!"" (slam's milk(glass) on the ground. and points furiously at his dad before he runs onto the bus.).)\]. Nature always has a way to teach, perspectives in micro and macro that lead to the way we live our lives. An innate response queuing you into how relative we all are. Maybe relative is what's gotten me into this predicament. I didn't know who they were, or why they came.. the dust settling became more of a struggle looking at the world and how we seemed to interact, a pariah of sorts, having scuffed the golden hand. They had a way about them, I'll give them that, the absolute deformity in uniformities caught in the cutting edges of meta and matters, all of which ruminates into a sort of psychotherapy of its own, a mentality that apparently can become the most lethal of weapons, the intersection of the animal in the man, in the hands of a sociopath with some money, well I think that can lead to a lot of damage. Well anyways, here I am 2 years later, healing, I didn't imagine stepping on the shoe of someone they called The Big Gaba would turn out the way it did, I can imagine the notoriety came in his youth before he started to call himself that, I want to imagine it was because he was mispronouncing grabber as in thief before that came as a sort of nickname. 

   Perception can come like hooks as the world around you seems to point you out upon appearance, resisting, futile as it all bares down, wounds like latched leaches growing fat as they take everything they can. A night can seem to take out a decade, weighing. Living with a guilt, would have taken everything so much sooner. The thought's on family, friends; the effect's on environment altogether. Where would you go when there's no place to go? Off in the woods to find serenity? To the oceans to feel peace? Effecting the world around you isn't possible when you don't interact with it. Maybe that's what some brilliant child decided when they were young, I wonder if they'd find themselves better or worse? Is silence really something that'd be beneficial for clarity? To find your center through centering yourself in the primordial. If seeing into the mind of a genius could give some insight on the right ways to live life, living in a series of decimal point's branching into causalities and flipping through their life like a photo album within some chronologic timeline. I guess it all circles back to the matter's at hand, what's done is done, I'm still here, less but more, twisting reality serving as a lesson of tastes and what you've become accustomed to like cheese or wine, then having to question if taste altogether is a point of acclimation or contention? Is that really something we should invest in? Finding new ways to utilize the world around us is something of a statement of how far we've come as a species, I suppose you can find success in everything if you've failed enough, finding something good out of something formerly perceived as bad, our relationship with our environment, from cats all the way to spiders and rats with which our relationships have grown from pests to pets, hygiene being among the most beneficial improvements over the course of history that has shown us a great number of things in observed contrast within binary and even quantitive study. Anyways I digress, the social impacts with a hint of infamously, but it's all since smoothed out to a lull in the chaos of it all through nearly a decade of consistencies, after heavy indulgence, satiated. Everyday tasks shrouded in an ambience of awkwardness, even in necessity escapades for food, or work, started to seem like an ultimatum, weighing the relationship of risk and reward through an endless stream of ambivalent awareness. Here we are, having no skills or talents to transcend me to new heights and an almost primal acceptance that wills me through this permeance. I can't help but feel trapped with this soliciting feeling, the obviousness of being socially drowned, accompanied with the physical interactions affecting the whole of my life.

The idea was simple: patrons could flip through a few pages, and if they liked what they read, maybe take a bookmark and order the book later.

Today I came back, and one of the books was gone. Stolen? Borrowed? Adopted?

This might sound strange, but I’m not upset. On the contrary, I’m kind of proud that someone found it interesting enough to bend the rules and take it home. I guess only good books get “adopted”. After all, books are meant to leave shelves and enrich someone’s life for a few hours, right?

1qynsm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1qynsm0/we_camped_where_the_road_maintenance_ends/,We Camped Where the Road Maintenance Ends. Something Followed Us Home.,"We picked the mountains because they were empty.

That’s what Dylan said when he dropped a pin on my phone earlier that week. No campground name. No trailhead. Just a GPS point on a ridge above a dead-end forest road. He’d found it on satellite at work, zoomed in until the trees were a textured green smear and the road looked like a scar running uphill.

If I’d known I’d end up calling 911 because my best friend was tapping on my second-floor window, I would’ve deleted that pin and gone to bed like a normal person.

“Two nights,” Dylan said. “No people. No kids with Bluetooth speakers. No ‘reserved site’ signs. Just us.”

I should’ve pushed back. I didn’t. The last month had been a pileup of small problems that all demanded attention at once—late fees, meetings, sleep that never felt like it counted. I wanted to be somewhere that didn’t ask anything from me.

We left Friday after work. Dylan rode shotgun with his boots on the dash and a grocery bag of snacks he swore were “trail essential.” I packed like I always do: extra water, a first-aid kit, a cheap emergency beacon I’d bought after a missing hiker story and never activated, and a roll of athletic tape that lived in my glove compartment like a superstition. My truck still had that faint old-coffee smell ground into the fabric seats, and the dashboard clock was five minutes fast because I’d gotten tired of being late.

Dylan mocked me for the gear for the first twenty minutes, which was normal. He mocked my playlists too, which was also normal.

The highway thinned into a two-lane, then a narrower county road, then finally a forest road with ruts deep enough to knock your teeth together. Trees tightened on both sides. The light changed when we started climbing and the sun dipped behind the ridge line.

Dylan checked his phone, lifted it toward the windshield like that helps.

“No service,” he said, smiling like it was a reward.

We passed a white metal sign half bent on its post. The letters were faded but readable.

NO MAINTENANCE BEYOND THIS POINT.

“Cute,” Dylan said. “They say that so people don’t sue when they pop a tire.”

“Or so people don’t go past it,” I said.

He pointed out the window like I was being dramatic. “We’re already past it.”

The road climbed for another forty minutes. No houses. No driveways. No other cars. Just trees, switchbacks, and washouts I had to crawl through in first gear. At one point I realized the little roadside reflectors had stopped. No red “eyes” catching the headlights. Just dirt and dark.

When we reached the pull-off Dylan had pinned, it wasn’t a campsite. It was just a widened patch of dirt where someone had turned around at some point. A narrow game trail cut from the pull-off into brush and climbed toward the ridge.

Dylan swung his pack onto his shoulders like he’d been there before.

“There,” he said.

We hiked up, not talking much because the incline made you choose between conversation and breathing. The trail was packed dirt with deer prints and scat. I noticed the prints without thinking. Deer, rabbit, something heavier. I didn’t assign it meaning. It was just data.

When we hit the ridge, the view opened hard—layers of mountains stacked out into haze. It was pretty in a blunt way. Dylan stood there, arms out like he was showing off a house he bought.

“Tell me this isn’t worth it,” he said.

“It’s worth it,” I admitted.

We found a flat-ish spot between two pines. Enough room for a tent and enough cover that you couldn’t see the road below unless you walked to the edge. Dylan liked that. He always liked feeling tucked away, like being hidden made you safer.

We set up camp on autopilot: tarp, tent, poles, stakes. Sleeping pads inside. Stove on a flat rock. Lantern hung from a branch. Dylan talked while he worked, complaining about his job, about his boss, about how he wanted to “unplug.” I half listened, more focused on the small stuff—where the wind came from, where water would run if it rained, what the ground looked like around the tent.

There were tracks around our site. Deer, mostly. A few that could’ve been coyote or dog. One set near a patch of soft dirt made me pause. The imprint was messy, not crisp. Four long toe marks and something like a thumb drag, like the foot had rolled weirdly.

I didn’t say anything. It wasn’t enough. Tracks rarely are.

We ate when the sun started to go. Instant noodles and jerky and Dylan’s “trail essentials,” which were mostly candy and chips. The temperature dropped fast after dark. My breath started showing. We pulled jackets on and leaned toward the stove for warmth. The smell of fuel mixed with pine and cold dirt.

For the first couple hours, it was exactly what we wanted—quiet, dull, normal. Dylan told stories about people we went to school with. I laughed because some of them were still funny. We both stared into the trees sometimes because you can’t help it.

Then a voice carried up from below the ridge.

Not loud. Not urgent. Just one word, drawn out, like someone testing whether sound would travel.

“Hellooo?”

Dylan froze with his fork halfway to his mouth.

We looked at each other.

“Did you hear that?” he whispered, like whispering mattered.

“Yeah.”

“Who would be up here?”

I stood and stepped away from the stove, listening. No second call. No footsteps. Just wind high up and the smaller noises of brush shifting.

“Probably someone on the road,” Dylan said, but his eyes stayed fixed on the dark slope below us.

“They’d have to be past the sign,” I said.

“Everybody’s past the sign,” he muttered.

I didn’t like how the voice had sounded. Not frightened. Not annoyed. Flat. Like the word itself was the point, not the answer.

We kept eating anyway. You don’t want to feed your own nerves if you can help it.

Fifteen minutes later, another voice rose from the same general direction.

A woman this time, softer, like she didn’t want to shout.

“Can you help me?”

Dylan’s eyes widened. The fork clinked off the metal cup in his hand.

I cupped my hands and yelled back.

“WHERE ARE YOU?”

My voice hit the trees and died. No answer.

Dylan stood and stepped closer to me. “We’re not going down there.”

“We can keep calling,” I said.

We did. Twice more. No response, no follow-up, nothing like “I’m hurt” or “I’m lost.” Just those two lines dropped into the dark and then nothing.

Dylan tried to joke. “Maybe it’s a couple messing around.”

“Out here?” I said.

He opened his mouth like he had an answer, then shut it.

Something moved in the brush to our left. Not crashing. Not running. Just a shift, like weight settling.

Dylan took a step back toward the tent.

I clicked my headlamp on and swept the beam across the trees.

It caught trunks, ferns, the flash of a pale rock. Then it hit something low behind a fallen log—an outline that my brain tried to label as deer and failed.

The head lifted.

Two eyes reflected back in the beam, bright points. Too high for how low the body was.

It moved again, and the way it moved made my stomach tense. Not smooth. Not cautious. Like it was choosing a posture on purpose and not quite fitting into it.

The outline changed as it shifted, longer limbs showing, joints bending at angles that didn’t match what I expected.

Then it ducked behind the log so cleanly it was like it had practiced hiding.

Dylan whispered, “Did you see it?”

“Yeah.”

“What was it?”

“I don’t know.”

We stood there another minute, scanning. Nothing showed itself again. No more voices. The night went back to being quiet and cold and full of trees.

We cleaned up and packed food away. I hung the dry bag on cord over a branch, far enough from the tent that it wouldn’t be right on top of us. Dylan kept his headlamp moving constantly like he was afraid to leave any patch of darkness unlit.

When we crawled into the tent, the nylon walls felt thinner than they should. Every zipper sound felt too loud. We lay there with our sleeping bags pulled up to our shoulders, listening.

Dylan said, “You think it was a sick deer? Mange?”

“Deer don’t crouch behind logs,” I said.

He exhaled hard. “Cool.”

A while passed. Minutes. Time has no shape in a tent when you’re waiting.

Then slow footsteps began outside.

Not heavy. Not stomping. Just deliberate steps around the perimeter of our site—leaves shifting, a twig bending, then a pause. Another step. Another pause.

Dylan sat up so fast the tent creaked.

“It’s right there,” he whispered.

I killed my headlamp. Light inside the tent would make us a bright rectangle from outside.

We listened. The steps moved from one side of the tent to the back.

Then they stopped.

A pause long enough that my chest started to ache from holding air.

Then, right outside the tent, a voice spoke.

It sounded like Dylan.

“Hey,” it said, in Dylan’s lazy tone. “You awake?”

Dylan snapped his head toward me so fast I heard his neck pop slightly.

“That wasn’t me,” he mouthed.

My stomach dropped. The kind of drop you feel before a car accident you can’t avoid.

The voice came again, closer.

“C’mon, man,” it said. “Let me in.”

Dylan put a hand over his mouth, like he was scared his body would answer automatically.

Outside, something scraped against the nylon—soft at first, then a little harder.

Not a tear. A drag. Like fingernails testing.

The voice shifted abruptly, like someone turning a dial.

Now it sounded like a woman, but the cadence was wrong, clipped and repeated.

“Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.”

Same sentence, same rhythm.

Then silence.

No footsteps walking away. No movement.

Just… nothing, right outside the wall.

My lungs burned. Dylan’s breathing was stuck, shallow and high.

After maybe thirty seconds, the footsteps resumed—slow steps moving away down the slope until they faded into normal night noise.

Neither of us slept after that in any real sense. We drifted in and out, listening, checking the zipper with our fingertips like it might move on its own.

At dawn we stepped outside.

Five shallow scratches ran down the nylon near the zipper. Not deep enough to rip. Deep enough to rough the fabric.

Tracks circled the tent. In the soft dirt near the entrance, impressions that looked like long fingers pressed down hard, splayed. Then a dragging mark, like weight shifting awkwardly. The pattern stopped near the zipper, then moved away.

Dylan stared, face pale.

“Tell me I’m not seeing hands,” he said.

“You’re seeing something like hands,” I said.

We ate quick. Not a real breakfast, just enough to put something in our stomachs. Dylan kept looking down the slope.

“We should check,” he said finally. “If someone’s actually out there—if those voices were real—”

I stared at him. “We’re not splitting up.”

“I’m not saying split,” he said. “I’m saying… just look around. Ten minutes. Then we leave.”

My instincts wanted to pack and go. But his logic wasn’t insane. People get lost. People get hurt. And we’d yelled into the dark and gotten nothing back.

So we took the minimum: headlamps, water, my knife, Dylan’s small hatchet. We left camp mostly intact and started down the slope toward where the footsteps and voices had been.

The hillside was uneven and the brush was thick. The further down we went, the more the trees closed in. It wasn’t dark—sunlight still came through—but the light was broken into strips and patches that made it hard to get a clean look at anything more than twenty feet away.

The “trail” turned into small signs: disturbed leaves, scuffs in soil, branches bent in a way that didn’t match wind. What bothered me was the lack of consistency. In one patch of mud I saw something that looked like a deer print. Ten feet later, something like a dog. Then a smear, and then what looked like long toes pressed deep.

“It’s like it’s switching,” Dylan said under his breath.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t want to make that idea bigger by naming it.

We found a deer carcass first—mostly bone, fur still attached in patches. Coyotes do that. Bears do that.

But this didn’t look dragged or scattered by feeding. The parts were pulled into a shallow depression and left there. Like someone had moved them into place.

Dylan crouched, face tight. “This is messed up.”

I was about to tell him we should turn back when something snapped behind us.

Not a loud crack. A clean, sharp sound, like a dry branch giving under weight.

Dylan and I both turned at the same time.

The brush behind us shifted. I saw a shape, low and still, like it had dropped into a crouch the second it knew we were looking.

I raised my headlamp without thinking, clicked it on, and swept the beam.

The light hit nothing.

Then, for a fraction of a second, it hit an arm.

Not a foreleg. An arm—long, pale, too thin, with a hand that had fingers that looked stretched.

It pulled back behind a tree trunk fast.

Dylan’s voice came out thin. “Nope. Nope. We go.”

We turned uphill.

That’s when it hit us.

Not from in front. From the side, like it had moved parallel with us and waited for the moment we committed to turning.

It came out of the brush in a fast, wrong burst—low, then high, then low again—changing posture mid-motion like it couldn’t decide what shape it wanted to be while it moved.

I saw gray skin in patches. A ridge of hair down its back like a sick dog. The head was the worst part because my brain kept trying to read it as something familiar and failing. It looked like it had the outline of a deer’s skull and the wrong kind of face tucked under it.

Dylan swung the hatchet instinctively. He didn’t connect. The thing slid back, then forward again.

Its hand—too long—caught my left forearm as I pushed past Dylan.

It didn’t grab like a person. It hooked.

A sharp pain shot up my arm. I felt fabric tear, then the warm slip of blood. It wasn’t one cut. It was multiple lines at once, like a rake dragged across skin.

I yelled, a hard sound that didn’t even feel like my voice.

Dylan swung again, wider. The blade hit something—bone or shoulder or whatever counted as shoulder—and the impact made a dull, heavy sound.

The thing jerked back like it didn’t expect resistance.

It didn’t scream.

It made a wet exhale, like breath pushed through a throat that didn’t have the right shape for it.

Then it moved—fast, sideways, into brush—vanishing in two seconds like it had never been there.

Dylan grabbed my arm. “You okay?”

I looked down. Blood ran from four long scratches, soaking my sleeve. The skin around it burned hot.

“I’m fine,” I said automatically, because that’s what you say.

“You’re not fine,” Dylan snapped. “We’re done. We’re done.”

We climbed fast. My arm throbbed. Every time my sleeve brushed the open lines it stung hard. The whole time, I kept expecting the brush to explode again. It didn’t.

When we broke back into camp, my stomach tightened.

The food bag was gone.

The cord still hung from the branch, cut clean. Not snapped. Not chewed. Cut.

Dylan stared up at the dangling cord.

“It cut it,” he said.

I moved to the tent, checked zippers. Closed. No one inside. Then I saw what had been placed near the entrance.

A strip of denim folded neatly on a flat rock like an offering.

Old blood stained it dark.

Dylan’s face went gray. “That’s mine.”

“It can’t be,” I said.

He yanked up his pant leg. His jeans were intact. No missing piece. No tear.

He stared at his leg like he expected it to change anyway.

“I didn’t bring an extra pair,” he said.

I picked up the denim with two fingers. It was stiff. The blood was dry.

My arm pulsed again, like it wanted to remind me this wasn’t a camp story.

We packed like our hands belonged to someone else. No neat folding. Tent down fast, shoved into its bag wrong. Gear thrown into the truck bed. Straps tightened with shaking fingers.

Dylan kept scanning the treeline. His headlamp flicked on even though it was day.

I slammed the tailgate. The sound echoed.

A soft click came from the brush beyond our site. A branch snap under careful weight.

I turned.

Partially behind a tree trunk, a face showed itself.

Not fully. Just enough.

Pale skin stretched too tight across bone in places. Patches of hair in areas that didn’t match any animal I knew. Eyes that weren’t animal eyes and didn’t settle as human either.

It stared at us without blinking.

Then the mouth moved.

In Dylan’s voice, it said very softly, very clearly:

“Don’t go.”

Dylan grabbed my injured arm without thinking and I hissed.

“Drive,” he said.

I didn’t hesitate. I got in, started the engine. Tires kicked dirt as I reversed too fast, the truck fishtailing slightly before I corrected and pointed downhill.

We didn’t stop until we reached the first place that had people—a gas station with a diner attached and a couple cars out front. Fluorescent lights. A bell on the door. The smell of coffee and fryer oil.

Normal.

We walked in looking like we’d been in a fight, which wasn’t far off. My sleeve was soaked. I’d wrapped it with gauze and tape in the truck, but it still bled through.

The guy behind the counter looked up. Gray beard, tired eyes. He saw my arm and my face and didn’t ask if we wanted cigarettes or bait. He just said, “You boys come off that forest road?”

Dylan nodded too fast. “Yeah. We need—”

I said, “We need to call the sheriff. And I need… something to clean this.”

The man didn’t argue. He didn’t laugh. He reached under the counter and pulled out a corded landline handset, dialed without looking. While it rang, he stared at Dylan and said, “You went past the maintenance sign.”

“Yes,” Dylan said.

The man nodded once, like that was the only confirmation he needed.

A woman in a diner apron came through the back carrying a crate of cups. She took one look at my arm, then at Dylan’s face, and stopped.

“Another one?” she asked quietly.

The man spoke into the phone in a low voice, turned partly away. I caught pieces: “two campers… ridge pull-off… injury… voices…” He hung up and looked back.

“Sheriff’ll come,” he said. “You tell it straight. No jokes. No guesses.”

The woman set the crate down carefully and looked at my arm.

“What did it do?” she asked.

I pulled the sleeve back enough to show the scratches. Four long lines. Swollen edges already rising.

Her face tightened. “Throw that jacket out,” she said. “Bag it. Don’t keep it.”

“Why?” Dylan demanded.

The man answered. “Because it’s not about infection. It’s about attention.”

The sheriff came. He was polite and tired and moved like someone who’d been pulled away from paperwork. He asked for names, dates, where exactly we were. He took photos of my arm and asked if we’d seen anyone else.

When we told him about the voices and the thing copying Dylan, he didn’t grin. He didn’t dismiss it. He wrote it down with a tight jaw and gave us a case number.

He said, “Don’t go back.”

Then he added, “And if either of you sees the other somewhere you shouldn’t be—don’t assume it’s a good surprise.”

I went to urgent care the next day. I told the nurse I got scraped on brush. She cleaned it, gave me antibiotics “just in case,” and asked if I’d had a tetanus shot in the last ten years. I said yes. She wrote that down. She wrapped my arm and told me to watch for redness traveling up the limb.

The scratches healed slower than I expected. The swelling took days to go down. Near my wrist there was a bruised patch in a shape that suggested a thumb, like something had tried to grip like a person and didn’t know where the thumb belonged.

Dylan texted me once that week: you good?

I texted back: arm sucks but i’m fine. you?

He replied: no. can’t stop hearing it.

After that he went quiet.

Four nights after we got back, I heard knocking.

Not on my door.

On my living room window.

My apartment is on the second floor. The lot behind the building slopes upward, so if you stand near the retaining wall out back you’re closer to my window than you should be. That’s why my brain didn’t immediately file it under “impossible.” It tried to give it the benefit of physics.

Three taps. Even spacing.

I sat up in bed so fast my shoulder popped. My heart was pounding hard enough that my throat felt tight.

The knock came again. Three taps. Same rhythm.

No footsteps in the hall. No neighbor voices. Just tapping on glass.

Then a voice through the window, muffled, close.

“Hey,” Dylan said. “Open up.”

My body went cold.

It sounded like Dylan. Not similar. Dylan.

I moved into the hallway without turning lights on. I checked my front door peephole.

Hallway empty.

The tapping came again.

“C’mon,” Dylan’s voice said. “I forgot my keys.”

Dylan lives across town. Dylan doesn’t come to my place late and tap on windows. Dylan also doesn’t forget his keys and then choose the least normal way to solve that.

The tapping slowed. Three taps became one. Then a pause.

“Please,” Dylan said.

It wasn’t panic. It was placement. Like the word itself was the tool.

“Please,” it said again, softer. “I’m hurt.”

My forearm pulsed under the bandage.

I backed away from the peephole and called Dylan. Not text. Call. If he answered sleepy and annoyed, I could breathe again.

It rang once.

Twice.

He answered, real voice, thick with sleep.

“What.”

Relief hit me hard.

“Where are you,” I whispered.

“In bed,” he mumbled. “Why are you calling—”

The tapping on my window stopped.

At the exact second Dylan answered, it stopped like someone lifted their hand away.

I said, “Don’t hang up.”

Dylan woke up fully in the space of a breath. “What’s wrong.”

“I hear you at my window,” I said.

There was a pause on the line. Not disbelief. Recognition.

“Oh my god,” Dylan whispered. “It’s doing it to you.”

He said, fast, “Don’t open anything. Don’t talk to it. Call the cops.”

“It’s quiet,” I whispered.

“That doesn’t mean it left.”

I went to the living room without turning on lights. The window was a black rectangle. The blinds were down but not perfectly—small gaps.

I leaned toward one gap.

Someone’s face was pressed close to the glass, close enough that a small patch fogged.

It looked like Dylan at first glance. Same hoodie. Same hairline. Same cheekbones.

For half a second my brain tried to accept it, because acceptance is easier than fear.

Then it smiled.

Too wide. Too practiced.

And the eyes caught the dim light inside my living room and reflected it back the way a deer’s eyes do when headlights hit them.

It lifted a hand.

Tapped once, gently.

The fingernail was too long.

On the phone, Dylan whispered, “What do you see.”

I backed away hard enough to hit the wall.

“I’m calling 911,” I said.

I did. I told dispatch someone was at my second-floor window. I gave my address, unit number, and said I’d been threatened. I didn’t add anything that would get me labeled as “paranoid” in the first thirty seconds.

Dylan stayed on the line while we waited.

“Stay away from the window,” he kept repeating. “If you hear me outside, it’s not me.”

Police arrived in about nine minutes. Two officers. Flashlights. Their faces had that default irritation until they saw my wrapped arm and how my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

They checked outside. They checked the slope behind the retaining wall. They looked for footprints in the wet grass. They looked for anything that suggested a person had been standing under my window long enough to tap.

They found nothing.

No shoe prints. No disturbed ground. No broken stems. Nothing.

One officer looked up at my window, then down again.

“There should be some kind of mark,” he said. Not accusing. Just baffled.

They took a report. They asked if I had a camera. I did—a cheap doorbell cam on the front door that only covered the hallway and the entry.

We checked it anyway.

No one came to my door. No one passed my hallway. No shadows. No movement.

They gave me a report number and told me to call again if it returned.

They left.

Dylan stayed on the phone until I promised I wasn’t opening anything and wasn’t going outside.

After we hung up, I sat on my couch with every light on until sunrise.

I didn’t hear tapping again that night.

But around 5:40 a.m., when the sky started to go from black to dark gray, there was one last sound from the living room window.

Not tapping.

A slow scrape, like a fingernail dragged down glass.

One line.

Then another beside it.

Then another.

Five parallel scratches that made my teeth hurt just hearing them.

I didn’t go near the window until full daylight.

There was nothing on the outside of the glass. No scratches. No residue. No prints.

But on the inside—on the dust that always collects along the bottom edge of the window frame—there were faint marks, like fingertips pressed and dragged slightly.

Long, narrow impressions that didn’t match my hand.

I vacuumed them up.

I bagged the vacuum canister and threw it out like a crazy person.

And I started doing something I never did before all of this: when my phone rings, I let it ring until I can place the person in my head—where they are, what they’d be doing, whether the timing makes sense.

Chapter Three

I woke up six hours later feeling almost human, which was ironic considering I was living with six creatures who were decidedly not.

The nausea was gone. The headache had faded to a dull throb. I sat up slowly, half-expecting my body to protest, but everything worked. Better than it should have, actually. I felt good. Really good. Like I’d had a day at a spa and a pot of coffee, neither of which had happened.

Vampire blood. I had vampire blood in my system.

That thought should’ve been more disturbing than it was.

The room had an en-suite bathroom—because of course it did—with a shower that had approximately seventeen different settings and water pressure that could probably strip paint. I stood under the spray for a long time, watching pink-tinged water circle the drain as it washed away the last evidence of last night’s catastrophe.

Someone had left clothes for me. Jeans that fit perfectly, a plain gray t-shirt, boxer briefs still in the package, even socks. Either they’d raided my apartment—unlikely—or they were very good at guessing sizes. Given that they were centuries-old vampires, probably the latter.

I got dressed and ventured out of the room.

The hallway was just as aggressively modern as the rest of the house—white walls, dark hardwood floors, abstract art that probably cost more than my car. Everything was perfectly clean. Perfectly maintained. Like a showroom or a museum.

I followed the sound of voices and found myself in a kitchen that made my apartment’s kitchenette look like a Easy-Bake Oven. Marble countertops, top-of-the-line appliances, an island big enough that each end had a different zip code. Isla and Nadya were there, Nadya reading something on a tablet, Isla poking at a very expensive-looking espresso machine with deep suspicion.

“How do you make it do the thing?” Isla was asking. “Thomas always made it do the thing.”

“Did you try pressing the button that says ‘brew’?” Nadya asked without looking up.

“There are seven buttons. They all have pictures. Why can’t they just say what they do?”

“Because it’s Italian and the pictures are universal.”

“Nothing about this machine is universal. It’s a puzzle box that occasionally dispenses coffee.”

I cleared my throat. They both turned.

“He lives!” Isla declared. “And he’s vertical. That’s promising.”

“How are you feeling?” Nadya asked, setting down her tablet.

“Like I got shot, died, and came back to life in a vampire house,” I said honestly. “So, you know. Tuesday.”

Isla laughed. “I like him. He’s funny.”

“Thomas was never funny,” Nadya said thoughtfully. “He was very serious. Very proper.”

“Thomas was born in 1883,” Isla countered. “Everyone was serious in 1883. It’s like they hadn’t invented fun yet.”

I moved closer to the espresso machine. “You want coffee?”

“I want to understand why this machine hates me,” Isla said. “But coffee would also be acceptable.”

I examined the controls. It was complicated, sure, but not incomprehensible. Clearly labeled grinder, water reservoir, pressure gauge. Someone had money to burn on this thing.

“Do you guys even drink coffee?” I asked, running water into the reservoir.

“Not for sustenance,” Nadya said. “But some of us enjoy the taste. The ritual of it.”

“Also it makes us seem more human when we have guests,” Isla added. “Which is rare, but it happens.”

I found coffee beans in a container that probably cost more than my monthly rent, loaded them into the grinder, and started the machine. It hummed to life with the kind of purr that only Italian engineering could produce.

“So,” I said, watching espresso drip into a cup. “About my duties. What exactly am I supposed to do around here?”

“Whatever needs doing,” Nadya said. “Maintenance, mostly. The house is modern but things still break. Thomas handled repairs, lawn care, cleaning—”

“Wait, cleaning? This whole place?”

“We have a service that comes weekly,” Isla said. “But they can’t know about us, obviously, so we have to hide during the day. You’d coordinate that. Make sure they don’t go anywhere they shouldn’t.”

The espresso finished. I handed Isla the cup. She took a sip and made a sound of genuine pleasure.

“Oh, that’s good. That’s really good. How did you do that?”

“Pressed the buttons in the right order,” I said, making another cup. “It’s not that complicated once you know what you’re looking for.”

“Thomas used to say that about everything,” Nadya said softly. “That nothing was complicated once you understood it.”

There was grief in her voice. Real grief. I handed her the second cup and started a third for myself.

“How long was he with you again?” I asked.

“Just over a hundred years,” Nadya said. “He was kind. Patient. Never treated us like monsters.”

“Even though we are,” Isla added cheerfully. “Monsters, I mean. Technically.”

“You saved my life,” I pointed out. “Monsters don’t usually do that.”

“We also threatened to kill you if you refused to work for us,” Isla said. “So, you know. Morally gray at best.”

Fair point.

I sipped my coffee—perfect, obviously, because apparently I was stress-brewing at a professional level—and tried to wrap my head around this whole situation.

“So I fix things, coordinate cleaning, run errands. What else?”

“Blood donation,” Carmilla said from the doorway.

I nearly dropped my cup.

She moved into the kitchen with the grace of a predator, all contained power and perfect posture. She was wearing black slacks and a silk blouse, like she was about to chair a board meeting.

“We’ll need to feed,” she continued, as casually as someone discussing a grocery list. “Regularly. You’ll provide.”

“How regularly?”

“Once a week from each of us should be sufficient. Less than a pint per feeding. Your body will replenish it quickly, especially with Father’s blood in your system.”

I did the math. Five daughters, once a week each, less than a pint. That was… actually manageable. People donated blood all the time.

“And Dracula?” I asked.

“Father feeds less frequently,” Carmilla said. “And rarely from humans anymore. You’ll primarily be sustaining us.”

“Cool. Cool. So I’m a juice box with a toolbox.”

Isla snorted coffee. Nadya tried very hard not to smile. Even Carmilla’s lips twitched.

“You could phrase it that way,” Carmilla said. “Though I’d prefer ‘valued employee with specialized duties.’”

“Does the valued employee get paid?”

That surprised her. “You want money?”

“I mean, I’m working. Don’t I get a salary?”

The three of them exchanged looks.

“Thomas never asked for money,” Nadya said slowly.

“Thomas got here in 1923,” I pointed out. “Different economy. Also, I’m guessing he didn’t have an apartment lease or a phone bill or student loans.”

“You have student loans?” Isla asked. “For what?”

“Two years of community college before I dropped out to work at my uncle’s shop. Turns out I’m better with my hands than with books.”

Carmilla studied me for a long moment. “Father will negotiate your salary. But yes, you’ll be compensated. We’re not slavers.”

“Just kidnappers who threaten murder,” I said.

“Exactly. There’s a difference.”

I couldn’t tell if she was joking. Her delivery was so dry it could’ve been either sarcasm or sincerity.

“Speaking of things that need fixing,” Isla said, clearly eager to change the subject. “The washing machine?”

Right. The washing machine with the weird noise.

“Where is it?”

“Basement,” Nadya said. “I’ll show you.”

\-----

The basement was accessed through a door off the kitchen that opened onto stairs leading down into darkness. Nadya hit a switch and lights flickered on, revealing a space that was somehow both utilitarian and expensive. Concrete floors, exposed ceiling, but everything was organized within an inch of its life. Storage shelves with labeled bins, a wine cellar behind glass, and in the corner, a laundry setup that looked like it belonged in a commercial facility.

The washing machine was a front-loader, high-end European brand. It was currently mid-cycle, making a rhythmic thunking sound that definitely wasn’t normal.

“How long has it been doing this?” I asked, kneeling down.

“Three weeks?” Nadya said. “Maybe four. Thomas usually handled these things, but he passed before it started.”

I pressed my ear to the machine, listening. Thunk-thunk-thunk. Rhythmic. Consistent. Something was loose inside or something had gotten into the drum.

“Do you have tools?”

Nadya pointed to a red toolbox on one of the shelves. Naturally it was a top-of-the-line Snap-on kit, the kind that cost thousands. I grabbed it and got to work.

Isla appeared on the stairs. “Need help?”

“Can you hand me the socket wrench?” I asked. “The three-eighths.”

She rummaged in the toolbox, found it, passed it over. I started removing the front panel of the machine.

“So,” I said, working the bolts loose. “Vampires. That’s a thing. What else is real?”

“What do you mean?” Isla asked.

“I mean, if vampires are real, what else is real? Werewolves? Ghosts? The Loch Ness Monster?”

“Oh, we’re doing the mythology crash course,” Isla said, settling onto the floor next to me. “Fun. Okay, yes, werewolves are real. Deeply unpleasant. They smell like wet dog and have territorial issues.”

“Isla has a grudge,” Nadya said.

“One tried to eat me in 1847. I’m allowed a grudge.”

I pulled the front panel free and peered inside. There—caught in the drum—was a sock. Well, what used to be a sock. Now it was a mangled piece of fabric wrapped around the drum’s padding.

“Werewolves are real,” I said, reaching in carefully. “What else?”

“Witches,” Nadya offered. “They’re real and generally more pleasant than popular culture suggests. We have a truce with the local coven.”

“There’s a local coven.”

“ A couple of towns over. They run a bookshop.”

“Of course they do.”

I worked the sock free, examined the drum. The padding had torn slightly where the sock had gotten caught. Fixable, but I’d need to order a replacement seal.

“Ghosts?” I asked.

“Definitely real,” Isla said. “Annoying. They can’t actually hurt you but they can make a lot of noise about wanting to.”

“Demons?”

“Real but rare,” Nadya said. “They mostly stay in their own dimension. Crossovers happen but it’s unusual.”

“Angels?”

Both sisters went quiet.

“We don’t talk about angels,” Nadya said finally. “They don’t talk to us.”

There was a story there. I decided not to push it.

“Fair enough. Zombies?”

“Reanimated corpses controlled by necromancers, yes,” Isla said. “Shambling undead who crave brains, no. Hollywood got that one wrong.”

“What about—” I went to pull out my phone, then remembered I didn’t have my phone anymore. “Do you guys have a phone I can use? I need to look up this part number.”

“You can use Thomas’s office,” Nadya said. “It’s yours now, I suppose. There’s a computer, a phone line, whatever you need.”

I reassembled the front panel temporarily, wiped my hands on my jeans.

“I can order the part online, have it here in a couple days. In the meantime, just don’t overload it and it should be fine.”

“You fixed it,” Isla said, delighted. “Just like that.”

“I didn’t fix it, I diagnosed it. Fixing it requires parts.”

“But you know what’s wrong and how to make it better. That’s fixing it in spirit.”

I couldn’t argue with that logic.

We headed back upstairs. The other sisters had gathered in the kitchen—Seraphina with a book, Vivienne sketching something, Carmilla on a laptop. They all looked up when we entered.

“He fixed the washing machine!” Isla announced.

“I didn’t—”

“He knows what’s wrong and how to repair it,” Nadya clarified. “The part needs to be ordered.”

“Remarkable,” Seraphina said, looking at me with new interest. “Thomas took three days to diagnose the dishwasher issue last year.”

“Thomas was also one hundred and forty two at the time,” Carmilla pointed out.

“Still. It’s impressive.” Seraphina set down her book—something old, leather-bound, probably in a language I couldn’t read. “Tell me, Dean, what else can you repair?”

“Most things mechanical,” I said. “Cars are my specialty, but I’ve worked on appliances, HVAC systems, basic electrical. If it has moving parts, I can probably figure it out.”

“Fascinating. And you learned this how?”

“My uncle owns a shop. I’ve been working there since I was sixteen. Started with oil changes, worked my way up to full rebuilds.”

Vivienne stopped sketching. “You take things apart and put them back together.”

“That’s the basic idea, yeah.”

“Can you take apart anything? Understand how it works?”

There was something intense in her gaze. Something that made me slightly uncomfortable.

“Most things, if I have the right tools and enough time.”

She smiled. “I wonder if that applies to people too.”

“Vivienne,” Nadya said warningly.

“What? I’m curious about how he thinks.”

“You’re being creepy.”

“I’m being interested. There’s a difference.”

Carmilla closed her laptop with a decisive click. “Dean, you mentioned needing a phone. Thomas’s office is down the hall, second door on the left. The computer password is ‘nightingale1883’—all lowercase, no spaces. You can order whatever parts you need. We have accounts with most major suppliers.”

“Thanks,” I said. Then, because I was apparently incapable of leaving well enough alone: “Can I ask you something?”

“You just did,” Carmilla said. “But proceed.”

“Why save me? I mean, I’m grateful, obviously. But you could’ve just let me die on your floor. Or, you know, eaten me. Why go through the trouble of saving me and offering me a job?”

The sisters exchanged looks. Some kind of silent communication was happening.

“We needed a caretaker,” Carmilla said finally. “You arrived at an opportune moment.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It’s the answer you’re getting.”

Nadya moved closer, her expression softer. “We’re not monsters, Dean. Not entirely. We don’t kill indiscriminately. You were dying through no fault of your own—helping you was the right thing to do.”

“And the fact that you needed an employee was just convenient timing?”

“Extremely convenient,” Isla said. “Like, suspiciously convenient. If I believed in fate, I’d say fate dropped you on our doorstep.”

“Do you believe in fate?”

“I believe in probability and coincidence. But sometimes coincidence is so unlikely it starts to look like something else.”

Seraphina stood, moving to the window. The blackout curtains were still drawn—sunlight was lethal to them, she’d said. I could see her outline against the fabric, graceful and still.

“In four hundred years,” she said quietly, “I’ve learned that the universe has a sense of humor. And timing. You needed sanctuary. We needed help. Perhaps it’s as simple as that.”

“Or perhaps Father saw something in you,” Vivienne added. “He’s very good at seeing potential.”

That was less comforting than she probably meant it to be.

“Right,” I said. “Well. I’m going to go order washing machine parts and try not to think too hard about fate and potential and the fact that I’m having a conversation with five vampires like it’s a normal Tuesday.”

“It’s Wednesday actually Wednesday ,” Isla said helpfully.

“Even better.”

I headed for the hallway, then paused. “One more thing. The supernatural world—is it all hidden? Like, does the government know? Are there agencies?”

“Some governments know,” Seraphina said. “Most choose willful ignorance. It’s easier than accepting that everything they think they know about reality is wrong. There are agencies, yes, but they’re underfunded and largely ineffective. The supernatural community is very good at staying hidden.”

“And if someone like me tells people?”

The room went cold.

“Then that person doesn’t stay alive very long,” Carmilla said flatly. “Our existence depends on secrecy. We protect that secret. Aggressively.”

“Good to know.”

“Are you planning to tell people?” Vivienne asked, tilting her head.

“Who would believe me? ‘Hey everyone, vampires are real and I work for them now.’ I’d get committed.”

“Smart man,” Carmilla said, almost approvingly.

I left them in the kitchen and found Thomas’s office—my office now, apparently.

It was smaller than I expected. Comfortable. A desk with a computer, filing cabinets, a wall of books that ranged from household repair manuals to what looked like first editions of classic literature. There were photos on the desk—Thomas with the sisters over the years. Him young in black-and-white photos from the sixties. Him middle-aged in color photos from the 2000s. Him elderly but vibrant in recent digital prints.

In all of them, he looked happy.

I sat in his chair—worn leather, perfectly broken in—and turned on the computer.

The password worked. I pulled up a browser and searched for the washing machine part. Found it, ordered it with overnight shipping using an account that had “Dracula” listed as the primary cardholder.

That was going to take some getting used to.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the ceiling.

Twenty-four hours ago, I’d been a normal guy with normal problems. Now I was living with vampires, learning about witches and werewolves and demons, and apparently I’d been hired as a combination handyman and blood donor.

My phone was gone. My car was probably impounded or scraped. My apartment was going to start collecting late fees on rent I couldn’t pay because I was stuck in a vampire mansion.

And somehow, impossibly, I was okay.

Not happy. Not thrilled. But okay.

Because the alternative was being dead. And dead seemed considerably worse than employed by the undead.

I heard footsteps in the hallway. Nadya appeared in the doorway.

“Hey,” she said. “I wanted to check on you. Make sure you’re… alright.”

“Define alright.”

She smiled sadly. “I know this is a lot. Thomas struggled too, at first. But he adjusted. Found purpose here. Even found happiness, eventually.”

“Did he have a choice?”

“Not initially. But Father is many things—controlling, manipulative, ancient and dangerous. But he’s not cruel. Not unnecessarily. If you truly hated it here, if you were genuinely miserable, he’d probably let you go.”

“Probably?”

“With modified memories. There are ways to make humans forget things. It’s not pleasant, but it’s better than death.”

I considered that. “And you? What do you want?”

She looked surprised. “What do I want?”

“Yeah. Your dad—Father—wants a caretaker. What do you want?”

Nadya was quiet for a long moment.

“I want you to not be afraid of us,” she said finally. “I want you to see us as people, not monsters. I want…” She trailed off. “Thomas was family. Not by blood, but by choice. I’d like to think we could be that for you too. Eventually.”

There was such genuine hope in her voice that I couldn’t help but soften.

“I’ll try,” I said. “No promises. But I’ll try.”

She smiled—real and warm and almost human.

“That’s all we can ask.”

She left me alone in the office, surrounded by Thomas’s life, trying to figure out how to build my own.

Outside, the sun was setting. Soon it would be dark. Soon the vampires would be active, moving through their house with purpose and power.

And I’d be here. Their caretaker. Their employee. Their prisoner.

Their family.

Maybe.

I turned back to the computer and started making a list of everything else that might need fixing in a house full of immortals who’d been alive for centuries but couldn’t figure out an espresso machine.

It was going to be a long job.

1qynroh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1qynroh/i_finally_asked_a_lady_out_and_she_said_yes_but/,I finally asked a lady out and she said yes. But she brought a friend along.,"A couple of days ago, I gathered all my courage and asked out a female friend whom I had known for years. The plan was to just get coffee and lunch. To my surprise she actually said yes. Of course, we were only going out as friends. I was still optimistic about it because I could at least spend time with her. I nurtured the crazy hope that SOMETHING might click. I truly believed that I was at a turning point and my life was about to change for the better. 

But the evening before meeting, she sent me a text saying ""my friend, (Male Name), will be joining us. Is that ok?"". My heart sank to my stomach. I felt what I can only describe as a knot in my throat. Obviously, I was NOT ok with it. I wanted to call off the plan and say ""actually, something came up. Let's meet some other time then"". But like an idiot, I pretended to be ok with it because if I had said otherwise, she would have just spent the day with him instead. 

Anyway, I ended up meeting her and her friend. I immediately started to regret my decision and wished I had just called the plan off when I had the chance. It was so horrible that only 20 minutes later, I wanted to get up and leave, but I resisted because it would have made things really awkward.

As I expected, she spent more time talking to him than me. I also noticed two things:

- whenever he spoke, her eyes were locked in on his. Whenever I spoke, she'd rarely make eye contact. She'd usually look down at the table. 
- she engaged with him more, asking questions, adding comments, smiling, laughing etc. But all I got was ""oh"", ""hmmm"", ""nice"", ""yeah, that's true"" etc. 

Edit: It felt like they were on a date, and I was just a bystander. 

My presence there meant absolutely nothing to her. I felt utterly powerlessness and defeated. It was worse than feeling lonely at home.  At one point I gave up and stopped talking. I decided to just be a listener and wait it out. Later, she must have sensed that I wasn't feeling dejected. 

I'm saying this because she suddenly started to engage with me in this forced, artificial way, asking me about things from many years ago. IMO, she must have realized she had been treating me different and tried to compensate and course correct. 

Anyway, things didn't go as I had hoped. She, knowingly or otherwise, made it clear that she had zero interest in me. When I finally got back home, I just took a shower and went to sleep.",8,1770494463.0,ForeverAlone,1,1.0,False

1qynr96,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qynr96,AIO because my boyfriend said that he was going to see his friend that’s a girl on Valentine’s Day because her bf died 2 weeks ago?,"This is my first ever post on anything so I apologize if it’s all over the place but I’ll try my best to make it where it’s understandable.

So my and my boyfriend have been dating for almost one year, Valentine’s Day is our one year anniversary together and about 2 weeks ago, his friend that’s a girl that he has known since highschool, her boyfriend got into a horrible head-on collision accident and died instantly (including the old man that drove into him). And also she like broke up with him 2 days before he died (I feel bad saying her business but adding might make this situation make more sense?)

I do have a picture of the screenshot he sent me of what his friend Lydia sent him, and he said to her that QUOTE ON QUOTE - “Please call me as soon as you can.
Don't be alone even if u can't talk
Let me know if u want to get a coffee or anything and just sit” 

And I really do understand her situation and I do feel sorry for her. 
And also keep in mind, him and Lydia hardly ever hangout and talk. But he has hung out with her bf playing  disc golf together.
And yes I have met her and her bf before about 2-3 times.
BUT him going one on one, on Valentine’s Day when that’s supposed to be our day really seems fishy to me!!! 

He told me this last night and the way he worded on FaceTime was “Ima see Lydia on Valentine’s Day since I told her I’m free that day and after that I can see you.”

ALL THE PHOTOS I SENT/ADDED WERE FROM TODAY GUYS!! When I woke up, instantly thought how wrong this seems and I don’t know :(
It’s just weird that he also told me that his friend Lydia said that I can come but he told me that I shouldn’t come? I don’t know, it’s so strange… I probably wouldn’t care if it was on another day but the fact he mentioned that he was planning on seeing her and they both spoke about it for Valentine’s Day is wrong for me and makes me question my worth. :(

I’m only 20 and I shouldn’t be feeling this way and I’m trying not to come across controlling at all, and the thing is, he is really protective and doesn’t want me to engage conversations of a random dude and give the guy a chance to talk to me.
But anyways, I really do understand his friend’s situation and it’s just a tough time for her.
If this situation was switched around where I had a guy friend that I’ve known for a while since highschool and his gf died and I tell my bf “yeah he said you can come, but I don’t think you should because it would be awkward.” 
😐 

I’m mad, not really sad, I’m disappointed, I’m questioning my own worth, and questioning if my boyfriend isn’t really the one that I thought God sent.

Here's my attempt at the **Salesforce** ***Coffee Ordering System*** question that's been popping up in interviews:

**\[Infographic attached\]**

**The question asks you to design:**

* Menu browsing + order placement (pickup/in-store)
* Customizations (size, milk, add-ons) with price calculation
* Payment processing
* Barista queue with status updates (PLACED → IN\_PROGRESS → READY)
* Real-time status for customers
* Scale from 1 store → thousands of stores

**What I covered:**

* Microservices split (Menu, Order, Payment, Notification)
* Event-driven architecture with message queue

Chapter Three

I woke up six hours later feeling almost human, which was ironic considering I was living with six creatures who were decidedly not.

The nausea was gone. The headache had faded to a dull throb. I sat up slowly, half-expecting my body to protest, but everything worked. Better than it should have, actually. I felt good. Really good. Like I’d had a day at a spa and a pot of coffee, neither of which had happened.

Vampire blood. I had vampire blood in my system.

That thought should’ve been more disturbing than it was.

The room had an en-suite bathroom—because of course it did—with a shower that had approximately seventeen different settings and water pressure that could probably strip paint. I stood under the spray for a long time, watching pink-tinged water circle the drain as it washed away the last evidence of last night’s catastrophe.

Someone had left clothes for me. Jeans that fit perfectly, a plain gray t-shirt, boxer briefs still in the package, even socks. Either they’d raided my apartment—unlikely—or they were very good at guessing sizes. Given that they were centuries-old vampires, probably the latter.

I got dressed and ventured out of the room.

The hallway was just as aggressively modern as the rest of the house—white walls, dark hardwood floors, abstract art that probably cost more than my car. Everything was perfectly clean. Perfectly maintained. Like a showroom or a museum.

I followed the sound of voices and found myself in a kitchen that made my apartment’s kitchenette look like a Easy-Bake Oven. Marble countertops, top-of-the-line appliances, an island big enough that each end had a different zip code. Isla and Nadya were there, Nadya reading something on a tablet, Isla poking at a very expensive-looking espresso machine with deep suspicion.

“How do you make it do the thing?” Isla was asking. “Thomas always made it do the thing.”

“Did you try pressing the button that says ‘brew’?” Nadya asked without looking up.

“There are seven buttons. They all have pictures. Why can’t they just say what they do?”

“Because it’s Italian and the pictures are universal.”

“Nothing about this machine is universal. It’s a puzzle box that occasionally dispenses coffee.”

I cleared my throat. They both turned.

“He lives!” Isla declared. “And he’s vertical. That’s promising.”

“How are you feeling?” Nadya asked, setting down her tablet.

“Like I got shot, died, and came back to life in a vampire house,” I said honestly. “So, you know. Tuesday.”

Isla laughed. “I like him. He’s funny.”

“Thomas was never funny,” Nadya said thoughtfully. “He was very serious. Very proper.”

“Thomas was born in 1883,” Isla countered. “Everyone was serious in 1883. It’s like they hadn’t invented fun yet.”

I moved closer to the espresso machine. “You want coffee?”

“I want to understand why this machine hates me,” Isla said. “But coffee would also be acceptable.”

I examined the controls. It was complicated, sure, but not incomprehensible. Clearly labeled grinder, water reservoir, pressure gauge. Someone had money to burn on this thing.

“Do you guys even drink coffee?” I asked, running water into the reservoir.

“Not for sustenance,” Nadya said. “But some of us enjoy the taste. The ritual of it.”

“Also it makes us seem more human when we have guests,” Isla added. “Which is rare, but it happens.”

I found coffee beans in a container that probably cost more than my monthly rent, loaded them into the grinder, and started the machine. It hummed to life with the kind of purr that only Italian engineering could produce.

“So,” I said, watching espresso drip into a cup. “About my duties. What exactly am I supposed to do around here?”

“Whatever needs doing,” Nadya said. “Maintenance, mostly. The house is modern but things still break. Thomas handled repairs, lawn care, cleaning—”

“Wait, cleaning? This whole place?”

“We have a service that comes weekly,” Isla said. “But they can’t know about us, obviously, so we have to hide during the day. You’d coordinate that. Make sure they don’t go anywhere they shouldn’t.”

The espresso finished. I handed Isla the cup. She took a sip and made a sound of genuine pleasure.

“Oh, that’s good. That’s really good. How did you do that?”

“Pressed the buttons in the right order,” I said, making another cup. “It’s not that complicated once you know what you’re looking for.”

“Thomas used to say that about everything,” Nadya said softly. “That nothing was complicated once you understood it.”

There was grief in her voice. Real grief. I handed her the second cup and started a third for myself.

“How long was he with you again?” I asked.

“Just over a hundred years,” Nadya said. “He was kind. Patient. Never treated us like monsters.”

“Even though we are,” Isla added cheerfully. “Monsters, I mean. Technically.”

“You saved my life,” I pointed out. “Monsters don’t usually do that.”

“We also threatened to kill you if you refused to work for us,” Isla said. “So, you know. Morally gray at best.”

Fair point.

I sipped my coffee—perfect, obviously, because apparently I was stress-brewing at a professional level—and tried to wrap my head around this whole situation.

“So I fix things, coordinate cleaning, run errands. What else?”

“Blood donation,” Carmilla said from the doorway.

I nearly dropped my cup.

She moved into the kitchen with the grace of a predator, all contained power and perfect posture. She was wearing black slacks and a silk blouse, like she was about to chair a board meeting.

“We’ll need to feed,” she continued, as casually as someone discussing a grocery list. “Regularly. You’ll provide.”

“How regularly?”

“Once a week from each of us should be sufficient. Less than a pint per feeding. Your body will replenish it quickly, especially with Father’s blood in your system.”

I did the math. Five daughters, once a week each, less than a pint. That was… actually manageable. People donated blood all the time.

“And Dracula?” I asked.

“Father feeds less frequently,” Carmilla said. “And rarely from humans anymore. You’ll primarily be sustaining us.”

“Cool. Cool. So I’m a juice box with a toolbox.”

Isla snorted coffee. Nadya tried very hard not to smile. Even Carmilla’s lips twitched.

“You could phrase it that way,” Carmilla said. “Though I’d prefer ‘valued employee with specialized duties.’”

“Does the valued employee get paid?”

That surprised her. “You want money?”

“I mean, I’m working. Don’t I get a salary?”

The three of them exchanged looks.

“Thomas never asked for money,” Nadya said slowly.

“Thomas got here in 1923,” I pointed out. “Different economy. Also, I’m guessing he didn’t have an apartment lease or a phone bill or student loans.”

“You have student loans?” Isla asked. “For what?”

“Two years of community college before I dropped out to work at my uncle’s shop. Turns out I’m better with my hands than with books.”

Carmilla studied me for a long moment. “Father will negotiate your salary. But yes, you’ll be compensated. We’re not slavers.”

“Just kidnappers who threaten murder,” I said.

“Exactly. There’s a difference.”

I couldn’t tell if she was joking. Her delivery was so dry it could’ve been either sarcasm or sincerity.

“Speaking of things that need fixing,” Isla said, clearly eager to change the subject. “The washing machine?”

Right. The washing machine with the weird noise.

“Where is it?”

“Basement,” Nadya said. “I’ll show you.”

\-----

The basement was accessed through a door off the kitchen that opened onto stairs leading down into darkness. Nadya hit a switch and lights flickered on, revealing a space that was somehow both utilitarian and expensive. Concrete floors, exposed ceiling, but everything was organized within an inch of its life. Storage shelves with labeled bins, a wine cellar behind glass, and in the corner, a laundry setup that looked like it belonged in a commercial facility.

The washing machine was a front-loader, high-end European brand. It was currently mid-cycle, making a rhythmic thunking sound that definitely wasn’t normal.

“How long has it been doing this?” I asked, kneeling down.

“Three weeks?” Nadya said. “Maybe four. Thomas usually handled these things, but he passed before it started.”

I pressed my ear to the machine, listening. Thunk-thunk-thunk. Rhythmic. Consistent. Something was loose inside or something had gotten into the drum.

“Do you have tools?”

Nadya pointed to a red toolbox on one of the shelves. Naturally it was a top-of-the-line Snap-on kit, the kind that cost thousands. I grabbed it and got to work.

Isla appeared on the stairs. “Need help?”

“Can you hand me the socket wrench?” I asked. “The three-eighths.”

She rummaged in the toolbox, found it, passed it over. I started removing the front panel of the machine.

“So,” I said, working the bolts loose. “Vampires. That’s a thing. What else is real?”

“What do you mean?” Isla asked.

“I mean, if vampires are real, what else is real? Werewolves? Ghosts? The Loch Ness Monster?”

“Oh, we’re doing the mythology crash course,” Isla said, settling onto the floor next to me. “Fun. Okay, yes, werewolves are real. Deeply unpleasant. They smell like wet dog and have territorial issues.”

“Isla has a grudge,” Nadya said.

“One tried to eat me in 1847. I’m allowed a grudge.”

I pulled the front panel free and peered inside. There—caught in the drum—was a sock. Well, what used to be a sock. Now it was a mangled piece of fabric wrapped around the drum’s padding.

“Werewolves are real,” I said, reaching in carefully. “What else?”

“Witches,” Nadya offered. “They’re real and generally more pleasant than popular culture suggests. We have a truce with the local coven.”

“There’s a local coven.”

“ A couple of towns over. They run a bookshop.”

“Of course they do.”

I worked the sock free, examined the drum. The padding had torn slightly where the sock had gotten caught. Fixable, but I’d need to order a replacement seal.

“Ghosts?” I asked.

“Definitely real,” Isla said. “Annoying. They can’t actually hurt you but they can make a lot of noise about wanting to.”

“Demons?”

“Real but rare,” Nadya said. “They mostly stay in their own dimension. Crossovers happen but it’s unusual.”

“Angels?”

Both sisters went quiet.

“We don’t talk about angels,” Nadya said finally. “They don’t talk to us.”

There was a story there. I decided not to push it.

“Fair enough. Zombies?”

“Reanimated corpses controlled by necromancers, yes,” Isla said. “Shambling undead who crave brains, no. Hollywood got that one wrong.”

“What about—” I went to pull out my phone, then remembered I didn’t have my phone anymore. “Do you guys have a phone I can use? I need to look up this part number.”

“You can use Thomas’s office,” Nadya said. “It’s yours now, I suppose. There’s a computer, a phone line, whatever you need.”

I reassembled the front panel temporarily, wiped my hands on my jeans.

“I can order the part online, have it here in a couple days. In the meantime, just don’t overload it and it should be fine.”

“You fixed it,” Isla said, delighted. “Just like that.”

“I didn’t fix it, I diagnosed it. Fixing it requires parts.”

“But you know what’s wrong and how to make it better. That’s fixing it in spirit.”

I couldn’t argue with that logic.

We headed back upstairs. The other sisters had gathered in the kitchen—Seraphina with a book, Vivienne sketching something, Carmilla on a laptop. They all looked up when we entered.

“He fixed the washing machine!” Isla announced.

“I didn’t—”

“He knows what’s wrong and how to repair it,” Nadya clarified. “The part needs to be ordered.”

“Remarkable,” Seraphina said, looking at me with new interest. “Thomas took three days to diagnose the dishwasher issue last year.”

“Thomas was also one hundred and forty two at the time,” Carmilla pointed out.

“Still. It’s impressive.” Seraphina set down her book—something old, leather-bound, probably in a language I couldn’t read. “Tell me, Dean, what else can you repair?”

“Most things mechanical,” I said. “Cars are my specialty, but I’ve worked on appliances, HVAC systems, basic electrical. If it has moving parts, I can probably figure it out.”

“Fascinating. And you learned this how?”

“My uncle owns a shop. I’ve been working there since I was sixteen. Started with oil changes, worked my way up to full rebuilds.”

Vivienne stopped sketching. “You take things apart and put them back together.”

“That’s the basic idea, yeah.”

“Can you take apart anything? Understand how it works?”

There was something intense in her gaze. Something that made me slightly uncomfortable.

“Most things, if I have the right tools and enough time.”

She smiled. “I wonder if that applies to people too.”

“Vivienne,” Nadya said warningly.

“What? I’m curious about how he thinks.”

“You’re being creepy.”

“I’m being interested. There’s a difference.”

Carmilla closed her laptop with a decisive click. “Dean, you mentioned needing a phone. Thomas’s office is down the hall, second door on the left. The computer password is ‘nightingale1883’—all lowercase, no spaces. You can order whatever parts you need. We have accounts with most major suppliers.”

“Thanks,” I said. Then, because I was apparently incapable of leaving well enough alone: “Can I ask you something?”

“You just did,” Carmilla said. “But proceed.”

“Why save me? I mean, I’m grateful, obviously. But you could’ve just let me die on your floor. Or, you know, eaten me. Why go through the trouble of saving me and offering me a job?”

The sisters exchanged looks. Some kind of silent communication was happening.

“We needed a caretaker,” Carmilla said finally. “You arrived at an opportune moment.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It’s the answer you’re getting.”

Nadya moved closer, her expression softer. “We’re not monsters, Dean. Not entirely. We don’t kill indiscriminately. You were dying through no fault of your own—helping you was the right thing to do.”

“And the fact that you needed an employee was just convenient timing?”

“Extremely convenient,” Isla said. “Like, suspiciously convenient. If I believed in fate, I’d say fate dropped you on our doorstep.”

“Do you believe in fate?”

“I believe in probability and coincidence. But sometimes coincidence is so unlikely it starts to look like something else.”

Seraphina stood, moving to the window. The blackout curtains were still drawn—sunlight was lethal to them, she’d said. I could see her outline against the fabric, graceful and still.

“In four hundred years,” she said quietly, “I’ve learned that the universe has a sense of humor. And timing. You needed sanctuary. We needed help. Perhaps it’s as simple as that.”

“Or perhaps Father saw something in you,” Vivienne added. “He’s very good at seeing potential.”

That was less comforting than she probably meant it to be.

“Right,” I said. “Well. I’m going to go order washing machine parts and try not to think too hard about fate and potential and the fact that I’m having a conversation with five vampires like it’s a normal Tuesday.”

“It’s Wednesday actually Wednesday ,” Isla said helpfully.

“Even better.”

I headed for the hallway, then paused. “One more thing. The supernatural world—is it all hidden? Like, does the government know? Are there agencies?”

“Some governments know,” Seraphina said. “Most choose willful ignorance. It’s easier than accepting that everything they think they know about reality is wrong. There are agencies, yes, but they’re underfunded and largely ineffective. The supernatural community is very good at staying hidden.”

“And if someone like me tells people?”

The room went cold.

“Then that person doesn’t stay alive very long,” Carmilla said flatly. “Our existence depends on secrecy. We protect that secret. Aggressively.”

“Good to know.”

“Are you planning to tell people?” Vivienne asked, tilting her head.

“Who would believe me? ‘Hey everyone, vampires are real and I work for them now.’ I’d get committed.”

“Smart man,” Carmilla said, almost approvingly.

I left them in the kitchen and found Thomas’s office—my office now, apparently.

It was smaller than I expected. Comfortable. A desk with a computer, filing cabinets, a wall of books that ranged from household repair manuals to what looked like first editions of classic literature. There were photos on the desk—Thomas with the sisters over the years. Him young in black-and-white photos from the sixties. Him middle-aged in color photos from the 2000s. Him elderly but vibrant in recent digital prints.

In all of them, he looked happy.

I sat in his chair—worn leather, perfectly broken in—and turned on the computer.

The password worked. I pulled up a browser and searched for the washing machine part. Found it, ordered it with overnight shipping using an account that had “Dracula” listed as the primary cardholder.

That was going to take some getting used to.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the ceiling.

Twenty-four hours ago, I’d been a normal guy with normal problems. Now I was living with vampires, learning about witches and werewolves and demons, and apparently I’d been hired as a combination handyman and blood donor.

My phone was gone. My car was probably impounded or scraped. My apartment was going to start collecting late fees on rent I couldn’t pay because I was stuck in a vampire mansion.

And somehow, impossibly, I was okay.

Not happy. Not thrilled. But okay.

Because the alternative was being dead. And dead seemed considerably worse than employed by the undead.

I heard footsteps in the hallway. Nadya appeared in the doorway.

“Hey,” she said. “I wanted to check on you. Make sure you’re… alright.”

“Define alright.”

She smiled sadly. “I know this is a lot. Thomas struggled too, at first. But he adjusted. Found purpose here. Even found happiness, eventually.”

“Did he have a choice?”

“Not initially. But Father is many things—controlling, manipulative, ancient and dangerous. But he’s not cruel. Not unnecessarily. If you truly hated it here, if you were genuinely miserable, he’d probably let you go.”

“Probably?”

“With modified memories. There are ways to make humans forget things. It’s not pleasant, but it’s better than death.”

I considered that. “And you? What do you want?”

She looked surprised. “What do I want?”

“Yeah. Your dad—Father—wants a caretaker. What do you want?”

Nadya was quiet for a long moment.

“I want you to not be afraid of us,” she said finally. “I want you to see us as people, not monsters. I want…” She trailed off. “Thomas was family. Not by blood, but by choice. I’d like to think we could be that for you too. Eventually.”

There was such genuine hope in her voice that I couldn’t help but soften.

“I’ll try,” I said. “No promises. But I’ll try.”

She smiled—real and warm and almost human.

“That’s all we can ask.”

She left me alone in the office, surrounded by Thomas’s life, trying to figure out how to build my own.

Outside, the sun was setting. Soon it would be dark. Soon the vampires would be active, moving through their house with purpose and power.

And I’d be here. Their caretaker. Their employee. Their prisoner.

Their family.

Maybe.

I turned back to the computer and started making a list of everything else that might need fixing in a house full of immortals who’d been alive for centuries but couldn’t figure out an espresso machine.

It was going to be a long job.

But at least it came with decent benefits.",1,1770494068.0,NaturesTemper,0,1.0,False

I slink back in my seat, trying to find the energy to get up, but I know I never will. Not to deal with what’s inside. 

I grab my bag from the back and sigh, remembering the science homework I still have to do. It’s easy for me, just.. tedious.  I have enough going on. 

I jam my key in the front door and it opens with a loud creak, making me wince. Is it too loud? I freeze, listening for any noise and sigh in relief when I’m met with silence, aside from the heavy breathing.

 My nose crinkles once the smell hits me. Alcohol, something salty, and more alcohol. I stare at the body that is supposed to be my dad laying across the couch, he doesn’t move, just breathes heavier. Guess he woke up and didn’t want to. I tiptoe over to him and pick up a few half empty bottles and dump them into the sink, putting them into a bag, feeling my way to the trash can. I refuse to turn the lights on. I don’t want him waking up and getting frustrated. 

I ignore the papers with words stamped with red rotting on the coffee table. I can deal with that when I get paid again. For now I have science to do. I don’t have time to worry about something that’s been happening for.. 

How long has it been? My eyes sting as I try to remember exactly when things went downhill so I shake my head, pushing those thoughts away. I can’t think about that right now. I might get stuck in the past. Just like him.

Azora’s POV-that same night

I’ve completed all of my homework, I’ve journaled, I drank hot cocoa, I’ve showered. I’ve done everything! So why am I pacing as if I have forgotten something? 

I stop my pacing when my foot brushes against something. I have only recently cleaned my room so what could possibly-

“Oh,” I breathe aloud, holding up the slip of paper that girl gave me. Is this what I was worried about? 

“It’s not like I need to contact her anyway,” I say to myself, “I am fine.” Why is there a waver in my voice?

Brushing that concern away I walk over to my desk and pick up my phone from where it was charging. I’m going to message her- just to tell her I do not need her help. I have everything under control. I am the Valedictorian after all. It is my brand, what I’m known for. 

I tell this to myself as I type the numbers in and send the message:

*Hello. Is this the girl who left me a paper with your contact information in the bathroom?  I am the girl you talked to. What was your name?*

I almost put my phone back down, but remember that I never told her my name. How rude of me.

*Sorry. I forgot to tell you my own name.  I am Azora Russo.* 

Will she even see it tonight? Is it too late to be messaging someone? 

I start pacing again.

Melody’s POV- later that night 

I’m knee deep in fabrics, pins, pencils, and scratch paper. I’ve been busy since I got home and it’s like 9 o’clock at night! I love this so much! I’ve gotten in about five new orders of dresses today and if I include the other three I still need to finish.. that’s eight in a week! Business is booming! 

I just wish I took more time to organize before I jumped in. I can’t find anything.  

That's going to be future-Melody's problem now. If I can remember to clean my studio that is. I need to start writing this stuff down.  
I’m reaching for some chiffon fabric when I hear the chirping notification from my phone. That’s weird, I wasn’t expecting any texts today..

My phone goes off again and I frantically try to find it under all of the fabrics and I shriek when it goes off again and I STILL haven’t found it, but then my hand hits something hard. 

“Ow!” I whine, “Oh wait!” I dig around in that same spot again and pull out my phone, “Ta-da!” I cheer. Now who texted me?  
I skim over the messages thinking it might be someone reaching out about a dress or alteration, humming along to my music as I do.  
“WHAT??” I screech before I can stop myself, “OMG SHE TEXTED ME!!” I launch from my spot on the floor and do a victory lap around my messy work station. Right! I need to respond!

*OMG HI! 😄 I didn’t know if you would text, but I’m so glad you did! How was your evening?* 

I smile a little too wide as the dots appear. I actually doubted if she would reach out for a moment there. I’m so glad I was wrong! I just saw that she looked stressed and I want to help her. I think I’m good at helping. That’s what Mom says at least. Oh!

*Azora:   My evening has been alright. Sorry for the late message, I didn’t think about the time.. How is your evening?* 

Melody:  *It’s totally fine! I was already up trying to find my way through my sea of fabrics anyway. I have about eight orders to finish by next week.*  

Wait, does she even know about my business? Stupid, stupid. You need to stop assuming people know things. 

Azora:  *Oh. That sounds stressful.. But the reason I decided to text you was because..*

Huh, what happened? Did her phone die? Wait, I see the dots again. I’ll let her take her time. Might as well look for the chiffon while I wait. 

Minutes later I hear another text come through. As soon as I found the chiffon, too. Guess I’ll just have another late night then. That’s fine, there’s a reason we have energy drinks!

Azora:   *I was going to say I didn’t need you or anyone else’s ‘help,’ but the truth is.. I have been slightly stressed. It’s a weird feeling and I don’t like it.* 

Melody:   *I get that! I feel like that, too, sometimes with my business and stuff. A way to sort of help is to only worry about what you can control instead of stressing over things you can’t control. Does that make sense?*

Azora:  *Hm.. just worry about what I can control.. Alright I’ll give it a try. Thanks for letting me talk. I’ll let you get back to your orders now.* 

I’m halfway through typing, telling her that it wasn’t a bother-really when she sends another text saying I never told her my name. Really? When did she even..?

I scroll back up and there it is clear as day, “*What was your name?”*  Wow, I need to start paying more attention.  What even distracted me? Right!

Melody:   *I’m so sorry! I completely missed that text somehow 😅 My name’s Melody! And I own a shop where I make dresses and can alter or mend anything related to fabric, I forgot to actually tell you what I did earlier, too. Have a good rest of your night!* 

After that I shake my hands out and begin following the pattern for this mermaid-styled dress. I should’ve finished it yesterday, but I didn’t have the time to do anything but the design-they want pearls in a pattern on one side and nothing on the other.

 I’ve just gotten seated when I hear my name being called from downstairs. By the tone of voice I can tell it’s going to be another long venting session. Mom has a new boss that’s stressing her out and she’s been staying later at the office and since I’m usually up.. Yeah today just wasn’t meant to be a work day I guess. Stealing one last glance at the half-finished dress I make my way to the stairs.

I can do more tomorrow. 

Jade’s POV- even LATER that night 

I’m staring at the ceiling. Again. I can’t sleep. Again. I reach for my phone, refusing to sit up all the way. I squint and the glow, no matter how low the brightness is it still feels too bright. 2:47AM. Yay, looks like I’m going to be up the rest of the night. 

I’m pretty sure this has to be insomnia, I once stayed up a whole day, but still couldn’t sleep once the sun went down. Or maybe I’m just a vampire. I’m already pale as the moon. Might as well commit. 

Ugh. I used to be able to sleep because I had someone to talk to. My boyfriend, well not really anymore, but I don’t know. The whole thing is weird.  

“This is stupid,” I say to the ceiling. 

*You’re stupid,*  it says back, *you’re the one who can’t sleep.*

Touché. I’m leaving now. I refuse to sit and stare at the ceiling. I could at least look at some stars. 

Grabbing my jacket, I open my window and slip out. I’m so glad our house is kind of small, even more glad that my aunt fell asleep on the couch after she finished off half a bowl of ice cream. I wish I could sleep like that, I’m so tired of being tired. 

I slip out the window and land by the bushes and walk down to the edge of the driveway, blasting alternative rock in my headphones. It’s already getting colder. Just like 9th grade. I snort, letting a small smile slip. Since when was I so reminiscent?  Taking a seat by the mailbox, I groan into my hands. Fine. I pull out my phone again, to text this time. 

*U up?* 

I’m not expecting anything, he usually sleeps like a baby. Instead I see the bubbles start typing not even a minute later. 

*I was wondering if you were gonna text or not. Let me guess..  can’t sleep?*

Most people think being interesting is about having crazy stories or being the loudest person in the room. Wrong. After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, analyzing what makes charismatic people magnetic, and studying communication patterns from podcasts like ""[The Art of Charm](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtofCharmTV)"" and books by experts like Vanessa Van Edwards, I realized something wild: interesting people aren't born, they're built through specific habits. And honestly, most of us are doing the exact opposite of what actually works.



Here's what I found after obsessively researching this for months. No fluff, just the psychological patterns that actually make people lean in when you talk.



Habit 1: Ask Questions That Make People Think, Not Just Answer



Everyone tells you to ""ask questions"" to be interesting. Cool. But what KIND of questions? Most people ask boring shit like ""what do you do?"" or ""where are you from?"" These are dead-end questions that lead to dead-end conversations.



Interesting people ask questions that make you pause and think. Instead of ""how was your weekend?"" try ""what's something you did recently that you'd do again tomorrow?"" or ""what's been on your mind lately?"" These questions bypass small talk and hit the deeper stuff people actually want to talk about.



Research from Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert shows that people spend 47% of their waking hours thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. Interesting people tap into THAT, not surface-level crap. They give others permission to talk about what's genuinely on their mind.



Pro tip: The follow up question is where the magic happens. Most people ask one question then wait for their turn to talk. Nope. Go deeper. ""Why did that matter to you?"" or ""How did that change things?"" This is called conversational threading, and it separates interesting people from everyone else.



Habit 2: Have Strong Opinions (But Hold Them Loosely)



Here's the truth bomb: agreeable people are forgettable. You know who's interesting? People who have a point of view. They're not trying to please everyone or avoid ruffling feathers. They actually THINK about stuff and form opinions.



But here's the twist, they're not stubborn assholes about it. They'll say something like ""honestly, I think remote work is overrated for most people"" and then actually LISTEN when you disagree. They're curious about why you think differently. This creates tension (the good kind) and makes conversations actually stimulating.



Behavioral scientist Robert Cialdini talks about the psychology of contrast in his work. When you present a clear perspective, it creates cognitive contrast that makes people engage. Vanilla opinions (""I guess both sides have good points"") are conversation killers.



Check out the book ""[Think Again](https://inspiredbyislam.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/think-again-the-power-of-knowing-what-you-dont-know-random-house-large-print-grant-adam-z-lib.org_.pdf)"" by Adam Grant. This dude's an organizational psychologist at Wharton and the book completely rewired how I think about opinions. He breaks down why the most interesting thinkers are the ones who update their beliefs based on new evidence. It's not about being right, it's about being intellectually alive. Insanely good read that'll make you question how you approach literally everything.



Habit 3: Collect Experiences, Not Just Scroll Through Them



Real talk: you can't be interesting if your life is Netflix, work, sleep, repeat. Interesting people actively seek out new experiences, even small ones. They try the weird restaurant, take the random class, talk to strangers at coffee shops, visit the museum exhibit nobody's talking about.



Why? Because novel experiences create what psychologists call ""episodic memories"", the kind you can actually tell stories about. Your brain barely remembers Tuesday night scrolling TikTok, but it DOES remember the improv class you randomly took or the hiking trail you'd never been on.



There's this app called Atlas that's actually pretty sick for this. It helps you discover unique local experiences and keep track of places you want to explore. Way better than just googling ""things to do"" and ending up at the same tourist traps everyone hits. It gamifies exploration in a way that actually motivates you to get out there.



Another resource: The podcast ""[The Tim Ferriss Show](https://www.youtube.com/timferriss)"" is gold for this. Ferriss interviews world class performers and breaks down how they approach learning and experiences. The episodes are long but packed with frameworks for trying new things and extracting lessons from them. His interviews with Derek Sivers and Seth Godin especially hit different when it comes to living interestingly.



Habit 4: Share Weird Details, Not Just Headlines



Most people tell stories like they're reading a news headline. ""I went to Japan. It was cool."" Okay, boring. Interesting people zoom into the DETAILS, the weird specific stuff that makes a story come alive.



Instead of ""I tried this new restaurant,"" try ""the waiter accidentally brought me someone else's order, this insane spicy noodle thing I'd never have ordered myself, and it ended up being the best meal I've had all month."" See the difference? The specificity makes it visual, makes it real.



Psychologist Dan McAdams studies narrative identity and found that people who tell richly detailed stories about their experiences are perceived as more interesting and memorable. Details create what he calls ""narrative complexity,"" which is basically what separates forgettable stories from ones people actually remember.



Practice this: When something happens, don't just note WHAT happened. Note the weird details. The smell, the random thing someone said, the unexpected feeling you had. These are the building blocks of interesting conversations.



Habit 5: Be Genuinely Curious About Random Shit



The most interesting people I know are curious about everything. They'll go down rabbit holes about medieval architecture, fermentation science, the economics of sneaker culture, whatever catches their attention. They're not trying to become experts, they're just genuinely fascinated.



This habit does two things. First, it gives you more interesting things to talk about. Second, and more importantly, it makes you EXCITED about learning, which is contagious. Nobody wants to talk to someone who's bored with life.



Read ""[Range](https://cdn.bookey.app/files/pdf/book/en/range.pdf)"" by David Epstein. This book destroyed my belief that you need to be hyper specialized to be valuable. Epstein shows how generalists with broad curiosity often outperform specialists, especially in complex fields. The research is solid, the stories are compelling, and it'll make you feel way better about having multiple interests instead of one narrow focus.



If you want a more structured way to build this curiosity habit, there's an app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that pulls insights from books like Range, along with psychology research and expert interviews on communication and social skills. You tell it your goal, something like ""become more charismatic as an introvert,"" and it creates a personalized learning plan with audio episodes you can listen to during your commute. 



What makes it useful is the customization. You can switch between a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context, depending on your mood. Plus you can pick different voice styles, some people swear by the smoky voice option. It's built by folks from Columbia and Google, so the content pulls from legitimate sources and connects ideas across different fields, kind of like how Range teaches you to think.



Practical move: Pick one random topic per week and go deep for like 30 minutes. Watch a YouTube video, read a Wikipedia article, listen to a podcast episode. Not because you NEED to know it, but because you're curious. This is how you build a interesting knowledge base that isn't just your job and your hobbies.



The Real Pattern Here



All these habits come down to one thing: interesting people are ENGAGED with life. They ask real questions because they care about answers. They have opinions because they think about things. They collect experiences because they want stories to tell. They notice details because they're paying attention. They're curious because life seems genuinely fascinating to them.



You don't need to be the most traveled person or have the craziest job. You just need to wake up and actually participate in your own life instead of sleepwalking through it. That's what makes someone interesting. Not performance, but presence.

1qynj8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketobeginners/comments/1qynj8d/question_keto_and_cholesterol/,Question: Keto and Cholesterol,"For the last six months I have been doing a high fat moderate protein low carb diet but not keto. I have food allergies that make doing keto consistently pretty tough. But my body has always felt really good eating a lot of fat and last summer I discovered that a lot of my very intense all over body pain was actually a reaction to high glycaemic load foods. So in August I switched to a low glycaemic load diet.

I really truly have never felt better. I finally get through the night only waking a couple times whereas before that I would wake 10 times and also almost every single night get up for a couple hours around 2am to do exercise because of how much pain I was in.

I recently got a nutritional panel done, a very very thorough one and all of my levels were the best they have ever been in my entire life. Even creatine, even electrolytes, even iron which has always been low no matter how much meat I ate or supplement with iron pills. The only thing that came up is that my LDL is quite high. My HDL is low and so I was told that my cholesterol profile is lower risk but that I should still try to bring my LDL down.

This is when I learned about saturated fat. I didn’t know before about saturated fat and I’m kind of embarrassed because I feel like I’ve done so much research and understand so much about the foods I’m eating. When I added it up I realized that the amount of cream and cheese I have been eating have had me consuming about 80g of saturated fat per day from these sources alone.

Now that I’m learning about saturated fat I have learned that it is not just in dairy but also in plant-based fats. For instance coconut seems to be completely saturated fat as are macadamia nuts.

I talked with AI for a bit and learned that while the daily recommended saturated fat intake for a normal diet is 20g, even keto diet plans from medical websites tend to have closer to 50 g of saturated fat in them. The AI explained to me that when people are in ketosis and burning fat that having more saturated fat isn’t as much of a problem.

So I have made the decision that despite my food allergies which will make this very very very tough - for instance I am actually allergic to coconut which is a staple in keto from what I’ve seen - I am going to try to do keto for a couple months to see if those LDL numbers improve.

I am concerned about simply replacing my cream and cheese-based fats with other fats that still have saturated fat in them. My only source of information really is the AI and so I was wondering if there’s anybody here that knows more that can share with me so that I understand a bit better. For instance I have friends that eat more coconut oil and coconut milk then most other people eat butter and dairy milk and yet I’ve never heard of them having high cholesterol from coconut milk

…so does anyone here have real world experience with this? And can help me understand? When I go onto keto should I be tracking my saturated fat and if so what should I be aiming for and additionally should I track the plant based versus the animal based saturated fat differently?

I have cut the cheese down to about one third what I was eating and I’ve cut the cream in half but I can’t eliminate these things because I’m allergic to things like almonds so I can’t have almond milk and cheese is one of the very few grab and go snacks I can have other than nuts.

I’m allergic to most nuts but there are three kinds of nut nuts I can have which are macadamia pistachio and hazelnuts. I’ve switched to avocado oil with nutritional yeast on my mashed cauliflower instead of melted cheese. But because my dietary options are so limited I get kind of tired of eating those three nuts every day and I really need at least once in a while to grab a baby bell cheese as a snack so I can’t eliminate cheese.

Sorry this is so long but thank you very much if you’ve read this far and have some thoughts for me ❤️

Edit:

Oh ps I can have MCT oil because it doesn’t contain the coconut proteins I’m allergic to and I have about 2Tbsp of that a day throughout the day in my coffee. I’m not sure now if that’s ok.",2,1770493901.0,ketobeginners,2,1.0,False

KZ AJ4
Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants
Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low
Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater
Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770493841.0,Eastmallbuy,1,1.0,False

Pulfur Lagerica (Munich Helles Lager) \[Croatia\] 

Very easy to drink and not bitter, extremely good entry level beer reminiscent of a danish pilsner but lighter - 3/5

Schönramer Weissbier Bock \[Germany\] 

Smells of sweet yeast but the aftertaste is reminiscent of banana, never had anything quite like it, it was extremely good - 5/5

Sacrilége Suspension (Blanche clementine basil) \[France\] 

It's ok, but tastes more like a sour white wine or cider, as far as a beer goes I need more sense of bitterness, that said the spices of clementine and basil come through excellently - 2/5 as a beer but 5/5 as a spiced white wine/cider alternative 

Beretta Spam (heavily hopped IPA) \[Romania\] 

Its tastes virtually the same as a random New England style beer IPA you can pick up in your local store for cheaper, its not that good as a standalone beer but it's good as a chaser to harder liquor - 2/5

Rioazul West Coast IPA (Black Rebel) \[Spain\] 

It's still an IPA but the taste is the opposite of the east coast New England style, and less heavy in the profile/body and also more leafy fresh - 4/5

Les Internable Craft Beer (Darker Flower Imperial Baltic Porter) \[France\] 

Very dark beer and tastes like a mixture of beer and roast coffee/chocolate, it tasted lighter than it looks thanks to the roasted flavor, 5/5

Prizm Smoothie Beer \[France\] 

It it a smoothie with a reminiscent scent of beer, it is very much a experimental beer but it is really delicious, great if you don't have a super high tolerance and attending a summer party, for example - 2/5 as a beer but 4/5 as a slightly alcoholic smoothie ",1,1770493838.0,beer,0,0.67,False

Luckily, the beans I buy typically have a one-way degassing valve built into the bag, but I’ve noticed that the beans themselves vary GREATLY day-to-day. Some days they taste great, and some days they taste awful.

I live along the Gulf Coast, so humidity is typically high but has been fluctuating as of late due to the Arctic blasts and cold fronts we’ve received. I’m not sure what humidity our house stays at but temp wise, it hovers around 69-70.

I know there’s a lot of factors to this, so I’m curious if anyone knows the full scientific explanation to this. Not new to specialty coffee consumption but am relatively new to pulling my own espresso (just over a year), and I feel like I have a good handle on the technical aspect of how to get a good pour.

There is ONE song , one country song that I would sing loud with my daddy in the car, it begins to play. I tried singing it to my baby boy in his stroller next to me. A lump the size of a dinner plate starts to form in my throat. I had this overwhelming feeling that I was being heard. Heard by who ? What do I mean by that ? I don’t know . I can’t explain it .

	•	If it could affect extraction or coffee taste

	•	And if it’s safe to keep using it, or if the part should be replaced

The soft ping of the data pad pulled Titus awake. He blinked in the dim glow of the room’s emergency strip, feeling Kelly’s steady breathing against his chest—her head tucked under his chin, one leg draped over his, warm and relaxed in sleep.

He reached for the pad on the shelf, careful not to wake her. The message was forwarded—origin masked, but the header was unmistakable.

From: Carol Winfield

Subject: Forward – Message from your mother

Titus opened it.

Titus,

Your mom has been advised of the previous situation. Enclosed is an attachment from her. I will be happy to forward any message. I assure you they will stay unread on both ends.

– Carol

He opened the attachment.

Hi Ty,

I’m sorry this has happened.

I understand you’re serious about Kelly. That’s kind of fast, sweetie 🙂 Not always in a bad way. If or when it becomes more, I would like to meet her. Maybe you both can come visit.

Love you. Stay safe.

– Mom

Titus stared at the words for a long moment.

This was the first time his mother had ever asked to meet a girlfriend. Ever.

He looked down at Kelly—hair fanned across his chest, face soft in sleep—and felt something warm and unfamiliar settle deep in his ribs.

He typed back quickly, thumb gentle on the screen so the soft clicks wouldn’t wake her.

Mom,

Kelly will have questions when she meets you. Hopefully soon.

Love you. Later.

– Ty

Send.

He switched to a new message—this one directly to Carol.

Carol,

Thank you for forwarding. Mom’s message means more than I can say.

Is it alright if I contact you in the future if needed?

– Titus

Send.

He set the pad down, exhaled quietly, and wrapped his arm a little tighter around Kelly.

She stirred, voice sleepy and muffled against his skin. “Titus… what’re you doing?”

“Replying to messages,” he whispered, pressing a kiss to the top of her head.

Kelly made a small, contented sound and rolled closer, resting her cheek fully on his chest. “It’s too early…”

He smiled into her hair. “Go back to sleep.”

She did—almost instantly.

0600

A firm knock at the door.

Titus gently slid out from under Kelly, pulled on shorts and a shirt, and opened it.

Cathy stood there—hair pulled back, already in work coveralls, looking wide awake.

“Let’s have breakfast,” she said. “I’ve got work for Jax at 0700. Move it.”

Titus glanced at his pad—new message from Edward:

Sleeping in. Relax. – E

He grinned. “Edward’s out. Let’s go.”

Kelly groaned from the bunk, rolling over. “Five more minutes…”

Cathy laughed. “No chance, Kelly. Up.”

They dressed quickly—jumpsuits, boots—and headed to the mess hall.

The mess hall smelled like fresh coffee and hot food. The outpost had a small but decent setup: a serving line with self-heating trays. Today it was scrambled eggs (real protein paste, not synth), thick-cut bacon, hash browns crisped on a griddle, and stacks of toast. A Black Rifle Coffee dispenser sat at the end—dark roast, strong enough to wake the dead.

Cathy loaded a tray—eggs, bacon, toast, coffee black. Kelly took the same, plus a side of fruit paste. Titus grabbed extra bacon and coffee.

They slid into a booth near the viewport—stars still drifting past, the mining outpost’s skeletal arms visible in the distance.

Cathy sipped her coffee, sighed happily. “Black Rifle. Gods, I’ve missed this.”

Kelly laughed softly. “You say that every time.”

A group of women—outpost techs, coveralls patched and dusty—entered the mess hall, laughing among themselves. They glanced toward the booth, eyes lingering on Titus.

Kelly noticed.

She rested her hand lightly on Titus’s arm and gave the women a bright, unapologetic smile—clear, casual, unmistakable.

Message received.

The women’s eyes flicked away.

Cathy noticed this as well. “Don’t take that wrong,” she said to Titus. “I’ll be blocking for Kelly when she’s not here.”

Titus chuckled quietly. “I figured.”

Time slipped by—caffeine kicking in, conversation easy. Eggs disappeared, bacon vanished, coffee cups were refilled.

Around 0630, Kelly checked her pad. “Jax has work for me now. Gotta go.”

She stood, leaned down, and kissed Titus—slow, deliberate—right in front of Cathy.

Cathy rolled her eyes, grinning. “Get a room.”

Kelly winked. “Already did.”

She headed out.

Titus watched her go, then turned back to Cathy. “She’s something else.”

Cathy laughed. “Yeah. She is. And you better not hurt her.”

They finished breakfast in companionable silence—coffee cups empty, trays cleared.

Titus headed to the lounge; Cathy went to meet Jax.

1100

Titus’s pad pinged.

Edward’s voice came through: Meet me in the infirmary. Kate is sending a staff member. Will be there in a minute.

Titus’s stomach dropped. What’s wrong?

Edward: Kelly injured her ankle. Nothing bad. She just asked for you to come.

Titus was already moving.

He reached the infirmary—a compact medical bay with two exam tables, a diagnostic scanner, and a small pharmacy cabinet. Kelly sat on the edge of one table, right leg extended, ankle wrapped in a compression brace. Cathy stood beside her, arms crossed, concern etched on her face. Jax and Kate were there too—Jax leaning against the wall, Kate speaking quietly with the outpost medic.

Kelly looked up as Titus entered. Her face softened instantly.

“Hey,” she said, voice small but steady.

Titus crossed to her in three strides, took her hand. “What happened?”

Kelly exhaled. “Stupid accident. I was walking down a corridor—old section, deck plate shifted under my foot. My right leg dropped into the gap. Caught the edge wrong. Minor fracture. Not my fault—just a loose plate that should’ve been fixed years ago.”

The medic nodded. “Hairline crack in the talus bone. Stable, non-displaced. Pain meds and immobilization for now. She’ll be fine, but she can’t fly left seat on the return trip. Pain meds will make her too drowsy.”

Cathy stepped forward. “I can take left seat.”

Edward, who had just arrived, shook his head. “Sorry, kid. You’re certified for maintenance reviews and short-hop testing. Not full transport. I’ll have to clear it with Joana first.”

Kate looked at Edward. “Come to my office. We’ll sort it.”

Edward nodded. “On it.”

They left.

Kelly squeezed Titus’s hand. “Sorry, Jax. It’s not your fault.”

Jax waved it off. “Not worried about the work. Just worried about you.”

Titus kept his hand in hers while the medic administered the pain meds—quick injection, then a brace adjustment.

Then Edward as a instructor you at you discretion allow Cathy void  hours 

The medical checks finished. The outpost crew had wrapped up repairs—Cathy’s work on the crane, conveyor system, and transport trolleys was complete. Jax finalized loading for the return trip—supplies, spare parts, a few sealed crates—and walked over to Edward.

“Well, Russell,” Jax said, smiling, “we’ve seen worse.”

Edward laughed. “Yeah. We have.”

Cathy’s gear was loaded with Edward’s. Kelly’s with Titus’s.

Brief farewells followed—handshakes, nods, quiet thanks.

Kate caught Edward’s arm before he boarded. “Eddie… how much vacation you got left?”

Edward raised an eyebrow. “Why? You want to take a trip?”

Kate smiled—small, private. “Maybe a hotel on Phorantis. Say 2-3 weeks. Just us.”

Edward’s grin softened. “Set the date. Send it to Hale.”

Kate glanced toward Titus, then back at Edward. “Maybe we can borrow his ride.”

Edward laughed. “Too slow.”

Cathy, Titus looking at Edward both handing him there data pads for review  Edward looks at Cathy’s Looks good Edward taps  his initials.

The outpost fell away behind them.

I grew up homeschooled and with no friends, I lived pretty isolated from people growing up besides being with my brother and sister. But we're all just as awkward, and didnt know how to even talk to each other growing up. 

So.. im 23 now, and ive gotten significantly better at socializing over time, but Im still awkward. And still dont know how to be friends, or be a romantic partner. Like everybody ive tried dating, has either ghosted me, or distanced themselves, assuming its because of my awkwardness. And recently my last ""talking stage"" I was told that I dont know how to treat a woman.. 

The only way ive tried making friends and meeting people is at work, but my workplace sucks.. its a negative work environment in a warehouse, and the majority of the people there, aren't my kind of people (like to party and blow their checks every weekend). The few Ive met there that I've tried talking to outside of work, just didnt work out because of other issues, like just not connecting with each other, them being difficult, getting upset over little things, being manipulative, stuff like that.. 

But I still want to meet people, I just feel like I haven't met my people. I feel like an outcast. And in public, I can make small talk, but most people don't want to talk. And I can only go out in public like maybe once every two weeks because my nearest town with activities like the mall, coffee shops, ect is like an hour away. The only places In the small towns nearby, closest being 20 minutes away, is a coffee shop and gym, and church. Which Im not Christian so church wouldn't work out. And at the gym, everyone is just wanting to do their own thing, listen to their music.. And at this said coffee shop I only ever see older people :|.

The hobbies I enjoy is guitar, reading, working out, and video games, all pretty introverted hobbies, so idk haha.

I plan on moving out of my parents place soon, but the cost of living is so stupidly expensive right now, I don't even know if Ill be in the mood to go out make friends when im struggling financially on my own.. or even afford to go out as often. it sucks

What do I do to meet people?
Any advice would help.. like I wish I knew if I was doing something wrong socially that pushes people away, but I mean I dont see anything wrong with the way I treat people. I treat people the way I want to be treated and sometimes even overly nice.",1,1770493627.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

My office will be in West Lake Hills, so commute is a key constraint. I’m looking for a 1 bed, and my total budget is under $2k for everything (rent plus utilities, parking, fees, etc.).

What I’m optimizing for:

* Reasonable commute to West Lake Hills (ideally not a daily traffic nightmare)
* Walkable or at least easy access to food, coffee, and things to do
* Close enough to Zilker, Lady Bird Lake, trails, and Barton Springs
* Safe and “easy living” day-to-day (parking, noise, general vibe)

Questions I want straight answers on:

* Which neighborhoods make the West Lake Hills commute tolerable, and which ones are a mistake because of bridge/river bottlenecks and traffic?
* Is Riverside actually as sketchy as people claim, or just certain pockets?
* East Austin: worth it for nightlife and food if I’m commuting to West Lake Hills, or will that get old fast?
* Any areas that are underrated for this commute and budget?

If you’ve done this commute or lived in areas like South Lamar, Zilker/Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin, or even farther out, I’d appreciate blunt feedback on what you’d pick (or avoid) with a sub-$2k all-in cap.",0,1770493385.0,askaustin,0,0.5,False

1qynb00,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qynb00/how_to_make_people_like_you_without_being_fake/,How to Make People Like You Without Being Fake: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Have you ever noticed how some people just walk into a room and everyone gravitates toward them? Not because they're rich, hot, or famous, but because they have this magnetic quality that makes you want to be around them? I used to think that was just luck or natural charisma. Turns out, it's not. It's a skill. And after diving deep into books, psychology research, and hours of podcasts on social dynamics, I've cracked the code on what actually makes people like you. This isn't about manipulation or fake smiles. It's about understanding human nature and using that knowledge to build genuine connections.

**Step 1: Stop Trying So Hard (Seriously)**

Here's the paradox: The more you try to make people like you, the less they will. Desperation smells worse than old gym socks. When you're overly eager, laughing too hard at bad jokes, or agreeing with everything someone says, people sense it. Their bullshit detector goes off.

Instead, focus on being **genuinely interested** rather than interesting. This is straight out of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", which is basically the bible of social skills. Carnegie says people care way more about themselves than they care about you. So flip the script. Ask questions. Listen like their words are gold. Not that fake nodding thing while you plan what to say next. Actually listen.

When someone feels heard, they associate that good feeling with YOU. It's not manipulation, it's just how our brains work.

**Step 2: Mirror Their Energy (The Chameleon Effect)**

This is backed by actual science. When you subtly mirror someone's body language, speech patterns, or energy level, they unconsciously feel more comfortable around you. It's called the **Chameleon Effect**, and researchers have found it increases likability big time.

If they're speaking softly and slowly, don't come in loud and hyper. If they're animated and gesturing wildly, match that energy. This doesn't mean being a copycat weirdo. It's about creating rapport through similarity. Humans are tribal creatures. We trust people who seem like us.

Try it next time you're talking to someone. Lean in when they lean in. Match their tone. Watch how the conversation flows smoother.

**Step 3: Use Their Name (But Don't Overdo It)**

Carnegie nailed this too: a person's name is the sweetest sound to them. Using someone's name in conversation triggers positive feelings. It shows you care enough to remember it and makes the interaction feel personal.

But here's the trick, don't be that person who says their name every other sentence like some creepy salesperson. Drop it naturally once or twice during a conversation. ""That's a great point, Sarah."" Or ""I totally get what you mean, Mike.""

Small move, huge impact.

**Step 4: Give Genuine Compliments (Not BS Flattery)**

There's a difference between compliments and ass-kissing. People can tell when you're blowing smoke. The key is to compliment something **specific** that shows you actually noticed them.

Instead of ""You're so smart,"" try ""I love how you explained that concept, it made everything click for me."" Instead of ""Nice shirt,"" go with ""That color really suits you, where'd you get it?""

Specific compliments feel sincere. Generic ones feel like you're working an angle. And according to research from Stanford psychologist Robert Cialdini's book ""Influence,"" genuine compliments activate the reciprocity principle. When you make someone feel good, they're wired to want to return the favor.

**Step 5: Be Vulnerable (Not Weak)**

This might sound backwards, but showing vulnerability actually makes you MORE likable. Researcher Brené Brown talks about this extensively in her work. When you share something real, a small struggle, a mistake you made, a fear, it breaks down walls. People connect with authenticity, not perfection.

But there's a balance. Don't trauma dump on someone you just met. Share something relatable and human without making it heavy. ""Man, I totally bombed that presentation last week, learned my lesson about practicing"" hits different than pretending you're flawless.

Vulnerability builds trust. Trust builds likability.

**Step 6: Make Them Feel Good About Themselves**

Here's the ugly truth about human psychology: people like you more when they feel good around you. It's not about making them laugh, although that helps. It's about creating positive associations.

Psychologist Robert Zajonc called this the **mere exposure effect**. The more someone sees you in positive contexts, the more they like you. So be the person who brings good energy. Don't gossip. Don't complain constantly. Don't drain people with negativity.

When you leave a conversation, they should feel lighter, not exhausted.

If you want to go deeper into social psychology and communication strategies, there's a personalized learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books like Carnegie's work, Cialdini's research, and expert insights on influence and relationships. 

You can set a goal like ""become more magnetic in conversations"" or ""build authentic connections as an introvert,"" and it creates a structured learning plan tailored specifically to your personality and challenges. The app turns these insights into customized audio sessions, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and context. You can adjust the voice too, some people go for something energetic during commutes, others prefer a calmer tone before bed. Makes it way easier to absorb this stuff while doing laundry or hitting the gym instead of just bookmarking articles you'll never read.

**Step 7: Remember Small Details**

You know what makes someone feel valued? When you remember that small thing they mentioned three weeks ago. ""Hey, how did your sister's wedding go?"" or ""Did you ever finish that book you were reading?""

This is next level stuff. Most people are so caught up in their own heads they don't retain details. When YOU do, it signals that you genuinely care. It's rare, and people notice.

Keep mental notes or jot down details after conversations if you need to. This isn't creepy, it's thoughtful.

**Step 8: The Power of Silence**

Silence makes people uncomfortable, so they fill it. And when they fill it, they often reveal more about themselves. Don't be afraid of pauses in conversation. Let them breathe. Let the other person think and respond fully.

Chris Voss talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference."" He's a former FBI hostage negotiator, and even he uses silence as a tool. It shows confidence and gives space for deeper connection.

Plus, people who don't dominate every second of conversation are way more likable. Nobody likes a conversation hog.

**Step 9: Show Up Consistently**

Likability isn't built in one conversation. It's built over time through consistency. If you say you'll text someone, text them. If you promise to grab coffee, follow through. Reliability is sexy. It shows you're not just flaky or fake.

The book ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear talks about how small, consistent actions compound over time. The same applies to relationships. Show up. Be present. Don't ghost people. The cumulative effect is massive.

**Step 10: Stop Seeking Approval**

This is the ultimate paradox. The less you need people to like you, the more they will. Desperation repels. Confidence attracts.

When you're comfortable with who you are, flaws and all, people feel that energy. You're not performing for validation. You're just existing authentically. And that's magnetic as hell.

Mark Manson talks about this in ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck."" Stop caring so much about what everyone thinks. Ironically, that's when people start gravitating toward you.

**Final Word**

Making people like you isn't about tricks or manipulation. It's about understanding what makes humans tick and showing up as your genuine, interested, and thoughtful self. Listen more than you talk. Remember details. Be consistent. Don't try so hard. And for the love of everything, stop being fake.

SW 312, today’s weight 291.6","I have juice fasted for a loss of 80lbs, I have keto’d, I have vegan’d, I have VLC’d. I have lived life many days eating very low calories and healthy meals. 

I love food, but know that any amount of it, keeps the weight on. I have used consistent supplement’s. I have adopted a healthy lifestyle many years. 

I know that my body is not efficiently processing insulin compared to what any normal consideration of calories in/out says. 

I am 46 yrs old, female, 5’8, Eurasian. 

At 315 lbs, I wear a size 18 and “people” assume that I am less than 200 lbs. I am abnormally muscular. 

When I was younger doing “ biggest loser” contests st work, I was banned for winning too many times, I later figured out that my muscle content was much higher than the average person. I also participated in those contests at migrant ed, where most of my competitors were Mexican. I mountain biked for a decade in the Sea Otter Classic hills of the Monterey Bay Area. I lost 118 lbs doing that in my 20s.

I was 100 lbs by age 5. 

Exercise, is great for you. But when you’re fasting, the ups and downs make it difficult to stay fasting;hunger becomes challenging to contend with. 

I have used enduracin, a wax matrix extended release niacin amide for a few years before bed to help manage my blood pressure, as both my parents have had open heart surgery, neither one is overweight, perhaps their issues are more environmental.  

I am in a good place mentally, and have the opportunity to be at home, able to laser focus on input, output, homemade broths, Celtic salts, electrolytes, etc

I am taking before bed: magnesium, calcium, Lysine, potassium, zinc.

During the day for pick me ups: L tyrosine, glutathione, b12, K/D3. 

I have used a joint supplement to manage aches and pains for about 6 months. 

I can honestly say, this water fasting, supplementing with bone broth will continue to work. 

Some days, I boil a clove tea, sometimes cinnamon sticks, I use ACV and Celtic salt and sometimes a monk fruit liquid sweetener. I enjoyed a sugar free jello last night as well, an a cup of Dr thunder zero. I had a cup of coffee this morning, with one creamer (liquid individual serving)

First few days I lost 3-4 lbs. then 2-3 for a few. Then 1.5 

One day I didn’t lose any but then my period started. During the period I lost approx 1 -2 lb a day. Today and yesterday I lost, 1-2 lbs. 

I may have just wrung the water out of my system, I may be unclogging some fecal impaction 

But I know this, the diverticulitis flares I was having from raw vegetables and other “healthy foods” was horrible. The joint pain I have/had, was awful. The fatigue, I’ve struggled with despite all of my efforts to eat healthy, think positively, be at the 300% level of efficiency and productivity wasn’t going anywhere.

I don’t plan to live this way forever, but I know that I won’t be stopping until I get under 200 lbs. 

180 is a dream goal.  I don’t care much about my physical appearance, as far as “being slender”.

At this point, with a 26 yr old daughter who is about to be married, and 10 yr old son, I’d like to live to 80, if possible.

I drank for many years in a marriage I wasn’t willing to let go of, (20 years and 11 months) can’t beat em, join em. I realize I am a food addict and will tell you that last Friday when I fried my family’s chicken, I smelled my arms for hours after every few hours for comfort! 

That’s ok. I didn’t eat any. 

As any person who has struggled with weight loss, people say, have a salad. Etc etc. yeah, you could. But if you know you’ll just have some more, better not to rile up the hunger and temptation 

On my son’s birthday last week (day 4), we went to Olive Garden.  Socially, I had a few spoonfuls of soup. An olive. A slice of tomato, and chewed up about half of a ravioli and half a meatball.  I didn’t gain any extra weight. And it probably helped me with a bowel movement that I had equating about a lb this morning. 

I think one could do this “OMAW”. One meal a week. So long as the meal was like the one I described 

I look forward to gummies -vitamin time. As you can imagine it’s like eating candy. Are their carbs? Sure. Will it throw off the fast? Idk. 

All I know is that, at this weight, these gummies and those minimal bites I had one day in one week, aren’t going to “tip the scale”.

If you are honestly using water as the main mechanism and leaning on bone broth for help (it will be much more comfortable); you’re doing darn well. 

Perhaps as my weight lessens, I will use less bone broth and may even consider some dry fast days. Or strictly water fast days. But for now, managing a household and the stresses of being a mom, wife, daughter, friend, human… this will work! 

Good luck fasters, bravo.

I work mostly from home, and have two young children that I get off to school and daycare/preschool first thing in the morning (this in itself is probably the most stressful part of my day).

I’ve never been a good morning person, and am much more “alive/alert” at night, however, since having children I have of course had to work against my natural wiring. That said…I tend to waste the first four hours of my day or so, give or take. It’s terrible. I’ll get the children off to school, then come home, scroll my phone, MAYBE workout a little bit or do a tiny bit of tidying. But for the most part, I can’t get myself focused on anything. As the day goes on, my productivity seems to progress much more. But from the hours of 6:30am to 11:30 am-ish….forget it. I have the attention span and follow thru of a gnat.

I know all the basics…exercise (that motivates me only for a very brief period of time). Try putting your phone away (this is sometimes tough because I DO utilize my phone for a variety of tasks). Try changing scenery, like go work at a coffee shop (tough because I don’t even have the motivation to get all of my things together and get myself out of the house yet). It’s terrible. Idk, I know there’s no magic solution. I’d also try to make my night times my more productive times, like after my children go to bed, but they’re up so early that I need to try to wind down and sleep myself.

TL,DR: Having trouble with doing ANYTHING productive during the first part of my day, and I’m wasting SO much time. Looking for simple mental tricks or advice/personal anecdotes on what has worked for others. Thanks in advance!",1,1770493221.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

SW 312, today’s weight 291.6","I have juice fasted for a loss of 80lbs, I have keto’d, I have vegan’d, I have VLC’d. I have lived life many days eating very low calories and healthy meals. 

I love food, but know that any amount of it, keeps the weight on. I have used consistent supplement’s. I have adopted a healthy lifestyle many years. 

I know that my body is not efficiently processing insulin compared to what any normal consideration of calories in/out says. 

I am 46 yrs old, female, 5’8, Eurasian. 

At 315 lbs, I wear a size 18 and “people” assume that I am less than 200 lbs. I am abnormally muscular. 

When I was younger doing “ biggest loser” contests st work, I was banned for winning too many times, I later figured out that my muscle content was much higher than the average person. I also participated in those contests at migrant ed, where most of my competitors were Mexican. I mountain biked for a decade in the Sea Otter Classic hills of the Monterey Bay Area. I lost 118 lbs doing that in my 20s.

I was 100 lbs by age 5. 

Exercise, is great for you. But when you’re fasting, the ups and downs make it difficult to stay fasting;hunger becomes challenging to contend with. 

I have used enduracin, a wax matrix extended release niacin amide for a few years before bed to help manage my blood pressure, as both my parents have had open heart surgery, neither one is overweight, perhaps their issues are more environmental.  

I am in a good place mentally, and have the opportunity to be at home, able to laser focus on input, output, homemade broths, Celtic salts, electrolytes, etc

I am taking before bed: magnesium, calcium, Lysine, potassium, zinc.

During the day for pick me ups: L tyrosine, glutathione, b12, K/D3. 

I have used a joint supplement to manage aches and pains for about 6 months. 

I can honestly say, this water fasting, supplementing with bone broth will continue to work. 

Some days, I boil a clove tea, sometimes cinnamon sticks, I use ACV and Celtic salt and sometimes a monk fruit liquid sweetener. I enjoyed a sugar free jello last night as well, an a cup of Dr thunder zero. I had a cup of coffee this morning, with one creamer (liquid individual serving)

First few days I lost 3-4 lbs. then 2-3 for a few. Then 1.5 

One day I didn’t lose any but then my period started. During the period I lost approx 1 -2 lb a day. Today and yesterday I lost, 1-2 lbs. 

I may have just wrung the water out of my system, I may be unclogging some fecal impaction 

But I know this, the diverticulitis flares I was having from raw vegetables and other “healthy foods” was horrible. The joint pain I have/had, was awful. The fatigue, I’ve struggled with despite all of my efforts to eat healthy, think positively, be at the 300% level of efficiency and productivity wasn’t going anywhere.

I don’t plan to live this way forever, but I know that I won’t be stopping until I get under 200 lbs. 

180 is a dream goal.  I don’t care much about my physical appearance, as far as “being slender”.

At this point, with a 26 yr old daughter who is about to be married, and 10 yr old son, I’d like to live to 80, if possible.

I drank for many years in a marriage I wasn’t willing to let go of, (20 years and 11 months) can’t beat em, join em. I realize I am a food addict and will tell you that last Friday when I fried my family’s chicken, I smelled my arms for hours after every few hours for comfort! 

That’s ok. I didn’t eat any. 

As any person who has struggled with weight loss, people say, have a salad. Etc etc. yeah, you could. But if you know you’ll just have some more, better not to rile up the hunger and temptation 

On my son’s birthday last week (day 4), we went to Olive Garden.  Socially, I had a few spoonfuls of soup. An olive. A slice of tomato, and chewed up about half of a ravioli and half a meatball.  I didn’t gain any extra weight. And it probably helped me with a bowel movement that I had equating about a lb this morning. 

I think one could do this “OMAW”. One meal a week. So long as the meal was like the one I described 

I look forward to gummies -vitamin time. As you can imagine it’s like eating candy. Are their carbs? Sure. Will it throw off the fast? Idk. 

All I know is that, at this weight, these gummies and those minimal bites I had one day in one week, aren’t going to “tip the scale”.

If you are honestly using water as the main mechanism and leaning on bone broth for help (it will be much more comfortable); you’re doing darn well. 

Perhaps as my weight lessens, I will use less bone broth and may even consider some dry fast days. Or strictly water fast days. But for now, managing a household and the stresses of being a mom, wife, daughter, friend, human… this will work! 

Good luck fasters, bravo.

KZ AJ4
Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

**June 7th**

Dear Diary,

It’s been a few months since I last wrote, but it's mainly because life’s not been going great. Well, it's been going great in some ways, but not in others. 

For the good news, I managed to move out finally, all the way to Tulip’s Hollow for that job with the server farm. The town is just as nice as when I decided to tour the house: real cozy, forested hills, an old-timey square with a concrete fountain. Lots of those Christmas pine trees. When I first breathed it in, the smell was the freshest I’ve ever tasted in my life. I took a walk by the lake and almost thought I was in a movie. The boardwalks, the little shops give you this feeling that you’re in a completely different world, everything feels lived in, deep in history and built up. I got one of those really good crullers from the bakery I visited last time. Golden crispy, just like before. 

The climate’s a bit different from New Mexico, but the wetter the better honestly. It looks like rain on the horizon all next week, and good, I’m tired of my skin cracking. I never want to go back to the desert again, heatstroke is way worse than people let on.

Mom and Dad were sad to see me go, but it was time and they were proud of me, and that feeling was something I’ve been chasing forever. I’ll have to bring them up here sometime, me and dad can finally plan out that fishing trip we always dreamed of. Mom would adore the lake too, she loves the water.

The house is awesome, two bathrooms, one floor, but big, lots of gardening space, and the woods are all around. My nearest neighbor isn’t close, but not so far either that I’d worry about wolves or something silly like that. It’s a little bit of a drive into town, but the view of the trees surrounding the road makes up for it. 

As for furniture, a few months ago my buddy Niles got me on these surplus sale websites to prepare for the move. They’re filled with companies or the military trying to offload stuff before they liquidate it, you know: dressers, file cabinets, tools. Most of it is still wrapped up or even brand new, they just don’t have any use for it; so it ends up dirt cheap, or even free. I got a bunch of really nice pieces shipped out, so I saved a bunch of money. 

All in all, this house is the perfect place for settling down with someone. Which brings me to the other stuff.

In the bad news, Mellie broke up with me. She just wasn’t ready to live together and didn’t want to leave town, all the stuff that we were fighting about for the last few months. Looking back through the old entries here, writing this stuff about how we’d “be together forever” was wishful thinking. We both just want different things from life, and I guess we’ll just have to find them apart. I was in love with her since we were ten, but- (scribbling indecipherable) 

I’ll write again soon, I think this helped to get my mind off her, if only for a bit. 



**June 11th**

Dear Diary,

I can’t lie to you, diary. I’m hurting. I’m hurting real bad.

Everything reminds me of her. You know that thing where you forget people’s faces? Well, I have some kind of sick version of that where instead I see nothing but Mellie’s face. That stupid smile with the little gap in her teeth, the freckles and curls. It's everywhere. I tried talking to the barista in town today and almost cried when she handed me my coffee. Part of me wants to beat myself up for making this jump; what the fuck am I doing out here? This community is small, how am I supposed to make a life here when everyone has known each other since childhood? 

The weather station wasn't kidding about this rain either, it started last night and hasn't been dry since. I even heard it in my sleep. I dreamed about, you guessed it, Mellie. It was the day we broke up, at sunset back in Santa Fe. She was holding me tight and I was crying, and that was when it started raining. In the dream, not real life. My tears were coming down on my own head, even as the sun was sinking. It started to get hot, like I was getting angry and sad all over again. 

I’m not proud to say I wept when I woke up. Crybaby Tom, right? 

Maybe this move was a bad idea but I can’t back out now, or ever really. I’d never pull myself out of debt if I turned around and sold this house. I just gotta stick with it.

I’ve never really been alone until now, but now I’m alone every day. Maybe I should get a pet? I’ve heard cats are pretty chill, but I wouldn’t want to let a little killer outside to harass the birds and rabbits.

The weather seems to agree with my mood at least. It’s supposed to keep raining all month, and the grey, wet air feels right for this kind of big sadness.

I think I’ll order a pizza tonight. I don’t feel like writing any more.

**June 12th**

Dear Diary, 

Something really weird happened today, and I really, really don’t want to forget the details. It’s unbelievable, something that I never thought possible, and when I say it out loud, it makes no sense. Rain can’t talk. It just can’t, but it might have sent me a message today, and I don’t know what to think. I guess I should start with the keyboard. 

So those old surplus sites, right? I was browsing through them way back towards the beginning of the month, looking for kitchen stuff, and I saw this unbelievable deal. 

It was a custom mechanical PC keyboard, with all the bells and whistles: rgb lights, nifty little shortcut buttons, even a pull out track pad. A piece of machinery probably worth hundreds of dollars, selling for nearly less than five (ten with shipping). I should have known it was a scam I guess, or I should have been suspicious, but hey; you literally couldn’t beat a price like that for something so cool! So I bought it, and was waiting for it to come to my house. I found a downside to living out here: stuff takes so long to arrive from the post office. Another thing I’ll have to adjust to I guess. 

I will say though, when I plugged that sucker in, I was just happy to have it. It was really cool…for like the five minutes I had it set up. Then I went to test it out and immediately knew why it was so cheap, whoever made it had screwed up the design. The keys were loose, and by loose, I mean, LOOSE! Like every time I’d hit one the force of my finger would shake two more keys down. So every word I typed came out garbled, and sometimes the keys would just naturally settle into being pressed, and only shaking the whole board would reset them. It was completely unusable, but for some reason, I decided to try it out anyways. I guess I just wanted it to work.

It’s been, you guessed it, raining, so it was a good excuse to play some games online to pass the time. Worst mistake of my life with this busted piece of garbage, especially with any team game ever. I’m also embarrassed to say it, cause my Mom was always right about it, but I just don’t have the temperament for competition, even games. Put that together with another Mellie dream last night, and you get an embarrassing, stupid meltdown. I unplugged that worthless plastic board, threw open my front door, and frisbee threw it out into the mud with both hands.

Childish, I know, but it just pissed me off so bad! And in the moment, it did in fact calm me down to toss it.

Afterwards, I decided to retrieve it, even if it was broken and probably water damaged; it would look trashy to just have a random keyboard in my driveway. That’s when I heard it. The rain had softened down to a drizzle, and there was a sound inside of it, a clacking that was very much not rain.

It was the keyboard, sitting out in the mud. It had landed face up, and I could see the rain coming down on the keys. It was getting dark out, but the sky above was light grey, like the sun wanted to peek through the clouds for dusk but just couldn’t, so it was easy to see the letters.

 The keys were loose enough to be pressed down by the drops, but that wasn’t what made me pause out there, soaking my ass off. It was that they were pressing down in a very deliberate sequence, repeating in a slow, methodical rhythm. Like it was a person typing. It took a minute for me to actually register the whole thing, but I was genuinely in shock. 

It read out: I L O V E Y O U , D O Y O U L O V E M E ? Just that, over and over and over again. It even hit the shift key to denote the question mark. 

By this point, I was convinced it wasn’t the rain, but rather some extra function for the original buyer, like a pass phrase for a personal program. It was an elaborate keyboard already, and with the clacking it was making now, it made me wonder if I’d missed something, that the loose keys were just a feature, or some type of lock.

So, I picked it up, and I answered: Y E S. It seemed like the response to use. And who doesn’t need a little love in life, right? I certainly could.

Well, nothing happened. In fact, the instant I moved it from the ground, the keys stopped of their own accord, and THAT freaked me out more than anything else. There must be a reason for it, but it was like the rain really was talking to me. I wasn’t expecting anything from answering, maybe a secret compartment to open, but nah. It was worth a shot I guess. 

Anyways, I brought it back inside, I’m going to try and dry it out, maybe put it in some rice. I hope I didn’t break it, it was out in the rain for a good 20 minutes.



**June 13th**

Dear Diary,

I think something might be wrong with me. I hope I’m not catching a cold, but I was out in the rain yesterday. I’m running a bit of a fever; we never got humidity like this out in the desert so I guess I wasn't prepared for it. I’ve had a couple really bad dreams too, not a healthy sign. Especially since they were both the same dream. 

In both of them I was in my house, and it was still raining. I was typing with that damn keyboard, just random words into a black monitor at my desk. The rain starts to get worse, it's beating on the walls, no wind, just these fat drops smashing against the wood and stone. My fingers start sticking to the keys. I’m sweating like a dog, and I go to pull them up, but my hands are stuck. Like my skin is gum melting on a dashboard. It starts getting hotter, clouds of steam billowing off my roof, the trees and ferns wilting outside. Like the worst part of summer times a million. My A/C kicks out and starts steaming, blowing hot air out of the vents. I try to stand up, but my back is fused to the chair, like, I can’t see where flesh ends and chair starts. I’m completely stuck, I can’t even move my head or neck, and my sweat starts steaming, running over my eyes until I can barely see. The rain is getting heavier, and hotter. 

That’s when it starts flooding; the water is so heavy in the clouds that it’s all just emptying at the same time on the earth around me. The floorboards begin to crack, the windows press in as water pushes against them. The ceiling creaks and buckles; the flood outside crushing the house, an alligator crunching on a turtle’s shell. There’s these scratching, desperate hands outside and they’re beating on the windows, trying to get in; they crack the glass and bring the water inside, like a pressure hose in a sauna. And when the water touches my feet, it's *boiling*. It's cooking my legs as it rises up. I can feel it seeping inside, like I’m a lobster in a pot, there’s a hiss of steam and it's my own body wheezing out as my skin and organs begin to broil. My heart slides down through my rib cage and into my lower gut, mixing into a hot slurry as the nerves cook and soften. I only wake up when the water hits my eyes. I can still feel the sensation of them *bubbling*. 

It freaked me out real bad, like really bad. But I guess on the bright side, no Mellie in the dream. Somehow, seeing her felt worse!

I’ve been at the screens too long maybe, too little sleep. I think I’ll turn in early and just rest in bed, maybe finish up a book or something. 



**June 14th**

I need to go to the hospital. I know that I need to go to the hospital, but the rain. I can’t go out there in the rain, I can’t. It’ll kill me, I know it will, but, I-(unintelligible)

My hand is melting. My hand. Is melting. There’s no other way to describe it, I don’t understand. My palm and fingers are thinning out like snow in summer, and it *hurts*. I had to hold a belt to my teeth and I thought I was on fire for a full hour, but it was just my flesh *dripping*. Droplets of skin and fat, and blood, puddling on my floor. I can’t stop it. Am I having a delusion? I had to take a painkiller just to write this!

I stuck my hand outside before trying to get to my car, and it was like bullets erupting on my flesh! The pain is up my arm now, I think I can see holes inside, there are veins poking through. The blood, it's not running like I’ve seen before, it's ballooning around my hand, pouring out of my fingers like a rubber glove with holes poked through. I have to be dying, but all I feel is *pain*. It’s everywhere: in my skin, my muscles, a sunburn but a million, million times hotter. Why is this happening to me?! I tried calling the hospital, but there’s no landline, the rain has kicked my cell service, and the internet went out with it. I’m trapped. *I’m fucking trapped in this house!* God, please let the rain stop. Please.

(Editor's note: Page breaks here signifying a lapse in time. Water damage increases.)

I had that dream again last night, only this time, the water didn’t stop at my eyes. It was dark, and cloudy, and boiling, but I could still see inside it. The hands were ripping at my body now, the cooked meat tearing away, floating like beef in broth. I was screaming, but the water was boiling out my lungs, I could feel them shriveling up like raisins, my teeth cracking and popping like popcorn. Blisters on my skin were filling up with fluid, but they were bursting immediately as I cooked and cooked and cooked. I’ve never yearned so much to be dry again in my life.

Then there was a woman, I saw her. It wasn't Mellie, it was some woman I’ve never seen before. She was swimming down from above, blocking out the sun through the roof of my dissolving house. The boiling water was stretching all the way up to the sky, like the sun was a boiler plate against my skin. She came down through the cloud of my cooking fluids and touched my face; her flesh sagging and hair streaming out like trails of liquid metal, and the pain was so intense that when I woke up, I screamed. The echo of the heat was still there against my body, and I went to wash my face, to feel actual cool water while I was sweating my ass off from the nightmare. 

But when my hand touched the spigot, it was like I was still in the dream! It boiled at the touch, and I screamed again for real this time as I shook it away. My water shouldn’t be that hot, and I had definitely set it *cold*!

Then I looked at my hand, and its melting, its fucking melting! My flesh is coming off the bone, and it's not like flesh is supposed to be, what’s happening to me- (Another break due to water damage) My eye is melting. (The remaining page is rendered unreadable.)

  
**June 15th**

I’m so scared right now, but I feel like if I cry that more of my body will start sloughing off like my hand or eye. I tried putting the eye on ice, forcing it to freeze, but it didn’t work, it made it melt faster; how the fuck does that make sense?! I vomited on the ground and it was red and black, all full of lumps of something like meat. Surely by this point I should be dead but I’m not. I still *feel* it boiling and I can’t cool off. I think that I can feel the slurry on my floor, I stepped on it and felt it, like nails in flesh as it started bubbling. When I close my eye, I can still see through the other one: it's a mess of red and white and crystal and it. hurts. I can’t take this!

If I hadn’t recoiled yesterday at the sink, if I’d let the water touch my face, would I still be able to speak? Or would that dream come true, would my other eye have boiled out of my skull, peeling like tomatoes, my tongue liquefying into red and brown? The nightmare happened again last night, but I only slept an hour because I was frozen with panic. 

She was there. I saw her again, that awful woman with the red eyes and the burning. The rain, it was her tears. She was smiling at me while I boiled, this crackling grin of putrid teeth, and there was an ocean of melting, bubbling flesh behind her. It was screaming, clawing, and my fluids were being eaten by its mouths and orifices as it cried out for mercy. She kissed me on the mouth and blew the water inside me, and it was like magma had been poured in my veins. It blew through my body and melted me away, until only the pain was there. I could not even scream as the flesh slurped my remains up, into darkness and pure agony.

The rain isn’t stopping, every time it gets thin enough to chance a break for it another torrent follows, and the water flooding my yard is ankle deep. What could I have possibly done to deserve this?  All I did was type “yes” on a fucking keyboard!

Why didn’t I buy a rain coat, you fucking idiot Thomas.



**June 16th**

(Handwriting has visibly degraded, words change in color, later shown in lab analysis to now consist of blood plasma, slurred words present in over 90% of material, reconstructed from forensic analysis based on possibility of major stroke)

She isn’t in my dreams anymore. She’s coming here soon. Mellie I should have never left you I love you. Mom and Dad I want to see you one last time and hug you, I don’t want to leave you both alone.

Hands gone, writing with blood in stumps. Pain indescribable. Tried knife, no good. Popped neck like balloon, pus keeps flowing. Feel it still on floor. Tried burning, no good. Stays liquid. Eye floated up, feel like glass shards scraping in sky.

Raincoat wouldn’t help. It isn’t water. None of this is water. Trees are dead. There are holes in my ceiling. The woods are smoking with no fire. God help me I’m so sorry, please save me.



**June 17th**

I got keyboard again. Will beg for death. I’m floating in Hell. I love you Mellie.

**Investigation and aftermath:**

Thomas Fairbanks was declared missing on June 26th, 2019, after a delivery man with the postal service brought a package to his house in Tulips Hollow and discovered it had burned down during a storm. Mr. Fairbank’s employment at the Tulips Hollow Data Exchange Center began the following Monday. 

The kitchen and bedroom were completely destroyed by the fire, with significant damage to other portions of the house; spreading to surrounding trees in abnormal fashion to wildfires mid rainfall. Efforts to notice or contain the fire were hindered by the storm, as well as the remote location of the house being too far from emergency services to take note. 

Neighbors were contacted regarding the death, but none were able to report on any strange conditions that appeared in the time frame of the diary entries. The parents likewise assumed their son to be moving furniture and getting comfortable, and did not wish to be overbearing.

He was declared dead on June 28th, presumably committing suicide by self-immolation, the diary discovered by investigators that same day.

The fire in question was ruled to be caused by a chemical agent yet to be identified; but shares similarities to phosgene gas in residue samples 1-3 taken from the site. It is possible that the gas had a hallucinatory effect on the victim, and the chemical was strong enough to fully consume the body once ignited. Though how it was delivered or activated remains speculation. Foul play is not suspected, as Fairbanks was new to the community, with no notable enemies and no reports of murders of any similarity.

The mechanical keyboard recovered from the site remains in the Tulips Hollow police evidence locker and no organization has claimed it due to ongoing investigations. Dismantling it led to no significant leads, and pictures are available upon request. The site through which Mr. Fairbanks purchased the keyboard was shut down weeks after the incident occurred; due to unrelated faulty merchandise sales. Likewise, one Niles Phillipe had no knowledge of the purchase itself, but was struck by the death of Fairbanks severely. Mellie Williams could not be reached for comment, as she is still in mourning.

Fairbanks had no known history of mental illness, though it is assumed that events in his personal life leading up to the chemical exposure exacerbated the condition. 

It should also be noted where the majority of recovered materials were discovered: outside the house, nearly 20 yards away from the site of the fire and against the far wall, covered by a set of soiled clothing matching the victim’s size at the time; alongside the broken mechanical keyboard, and the diary that sat beneath. 



**Updated as of 2023:** This case: Case 2700-AW, Subcategory: Missing Person/Disappearance, dubbed “Chlorine Naiad” by my co-worker Bill Donahue, was one of the first that I transcribed into the database in my tenure as Record Keeper at the Question Everything Department. Before this, there was no digital footprint of these cases at all, and much of the information was a hodge-podge of unsorted papers, half-rotten audio logs, and ramblings of “lunatics” dismissed by the police and other institutions.

As such, the filing and ease of access has afforded a development in this case, in no small part by Bill. Though I find him abrasive, obnoxious, and horrible in any and all office space and make no small effort in trying to get my superiors to notice this fact, his field work is impeccable, and he proved it here today. 

He managed to track down the delivery man that discovered the burned remains of the home, and apparently he was the one to find the keyboard initially. When questioned, he claimed that the keyboard exhibited the phenomena recorded by Fairbank’s diary, though it was dismissed by police and investigators as shock at the discovery of the site. Quoted: “It was still drizzling that day, and when I heard the thing making that racket, I thought it might have been someone trying to pull free of rubble or something.” 

He claimed to have seen the words repeated over and over by the keys: 

I L O V E Y O U

Further inquiry revealed no further insight. Case declared closed until acquisition of keyboard deemed possible. I myself am very happy we are currently amid a drought.

35M looking to make some new friends. Like a lot of people, a few friendships have drifted over the years due to life, work etc. and I’d like to build some new, genuine connections.

I’m UK based (between the North West and West Midlands) and ideally would love to meet people locally, but I’m also happy to travel a bit if needed. Somewhat around my age would be good, but I'm cool as long as 18+ as the connection is more important!

I'd describe myself as easy going, a little introverted, and can be a bit shy to start with, but soon open up once I’m comfortable. Ideally, I’d like to start by chatting online and, if we get on, meet up in real life. I’m looking for something long-term and a genuine mate or two.

Into hiking, nature, and getting outdoors. Also enjoy watching the F1, reading, history, and cooking. Like travelling, exploring new places, and learning languages too.

Would be happy to just chat, meet for a drink or coffee, explore somewhere new, do a hike together... Up for different plans!

If you're looking for something similar and are interested, feel free to message me!

Sang country songs together over a joint on the beach. She let me sleep over at her place on the couch.  Thirty minutes before falling asleep, I could tell she was contemplating sleeping together, but her restraint prevailed, and we kissed each other good night.   We were both groggy in the morning, had coffee, I got my shit together, Uber'd to my car, and went home.

I can't get her out of my head.  I've dated nearly a dozen women since my divorce in 2022, and this woman is the first woman I've had strong, strong emotional attachment to.

She checks all of my boxes.  Smart, funny business owner in sales (as am I).  Got her shit together, amazingly beautiful, sexy af, no kids.  She and I are both high-earners, love snowboarding/skiing, and both live at the beach. We have a lot of similar interests.

What's my next move here?  I dont want to flood her with emotion and tell her the impact she's had on me since I last saw her.  I want her to know how much Im into her, but I dont want to come off desperate or emotionally immature.

Now it's Saturday morning.  We exchanged a handful of texts since I last saw her, but nothing serious.  Our post date texts have been light and calm.

I'm leaving on a business trip to Miami for a week, and I dont want the connection to fade.  How do I slow roll this?  How do I show interest without coming off crazy?  What signs should I be picking up on that she is also interested?

I've been looking into the Capricorn woman's personality, and the interwebz says she is an ambitious woman, grounded in stability (which she 100% is) and slow to open herself up and express emotion and feelings

My siblings and I were raised by two narcissists. Current day, my brother and I have cut contact with my father and minimal contact with my mother, while my sister unfortunately is living with my mother temporarily. 

Our mother has always had undiagnosed issues: frequent extreme mood shifts, quick to anger, yelling screaming, calling us names. Definitely verbally and mentally abusive, not physically thankfully. We believe she is a narcissist…completely unable to see other people’s point of view and constantly in victim mode. I was the scapegoat and my younger sister the golden child that my mom leaned on heavily.

A few years ago, my sister moved in with mom and mom’s boyfriend so she could buy a home. Her home is still being renovated and is completely unlivable; she also has a large reactive dog she can’t bring around other people. Quite unfortunately, last year BOTH parents experienced critical health challenges (mother with cancer and father with drug induced stroke/hospitalization). While my brother and I provided very minimal, distanced support, sis took on caregiving for both. She became dads health surrogate and took on going to all moms appointments and providing care etc. Obviously, with them both being narcissists it didn’t turn out well. Father went right back to his old life style and financially abusing my grandmother. Mother’s abusive behavior and meltdowns increased tenfold towards her boyfriend and my sister. This caused a lot of tension between my sis and us because she felt she had no help, was traumatized, and felt unappreciated. It’s been rough because we support her and have offered her to stay with one of us but we refuse to offer any other help outside that. My sister can’t leave her dog so she is kinda stuck. Some examples of the abuse: waking up at night and making tons of noise/walking into their rooms/waking them up leading to them being sleep deprived every day at work, cursing at them; name calling (saying she hates them, he isn’t a man etc etc; throwing things; hitting herself; threatening to kill herself;telling him he keeps messing up or making her life worse. The tiniest things set her off like him making her coffee wrong, him grabbing the wrong thing she asked for, him not taking her out when he gets off work. Mind you, this man works all day doing tough labor, comes home and takes care of her. Buys her expensive vacations, nice things, takes her out constantly. This man is a saint. In contrast, my mom has struggled to keep a job and hasn’t worked since her cancer diagnosis (she’s cancer-free now), doesn’t cook or clean - and when she does she complains all day about how ungrateful everyone is. This past year was rough….she had to have her entire reproductive system removed and have targeted chemo due to the cancer. But, she was like this since we were kids. 

Now, my sister is finally nearing when she will be able to move into her home. The thing is, my mother’s behavior has been absolutely appalling, especially how she treats her boyfriend. Complete emotional and verbal abuse. I only see this amplifying once my sister moves out. The boyfriend is getting sick of her behavior so it’s only a matter of time until he eventually ends the relationship. 
My mom doesn’t have any family here and no where else to go. Her parents both passed away within the last year. Her siblings have their own lives and would not want her to live with them. There’s no way me or my brother (he has a new baby who he doesn’t like my mom around due to her MAGA and anti-vax beliefs). I fear my sister will end up with my mom back at her new home. My mom has nothing…no assets, no job, no savings, no retirement saved…my sister is in her mid thirties and eventually wants a family and partner…she cannot even date with my mom around due to how explosive and racist she is.

We have warned my mother of her boyfriend leaving her due to her behavior - she seems sorrowful and comes to an understanding about her behavior but then the next small thing happens and she doesn’t care or it goes right out the window. She is a petulant child that is impossible to reason with. There seems to be some ADHD or a mood disorder like BPD. She’s in therapy for the can we PTSD, but as you might expect, she’s using her uncovered trauma as a justification for her behavior and using what she learns in therapy to use in fights. I’ve told my sister that her and the boyfriend need to stop hoping she’ll change and focus on what they can control. They need to start setting boundaries - this of course is making my mom act out more. 

What boundaries can my sister and the boyfriend set to minimize interaction and explosions from my mom? What can my sister start doing now to prepare my mom to not move in with her? What can my siblings and I do now to ensure my mother won’t become a burden on us due to her poor life planning? What services are in place to help someone like my mom live independently?

**Café**

* **Variedade**: F1 Mariana (Cross: Lapar 59 x Ethiopian)
* **Altitude**: 1.200m
* **Processo**: Natural
* **Torra**: Média
* **Produtor**:  Mariana
* **Região**: Costa Rica
* **Notas**: Banana, Kiwi Amarelo, manga desidratada

**Sensorial**

* **Aroma seco:** Manga, banana, toque doce.
* **Aroma molhado**: Banana madura, manga, nuance amendoad**a.**

**Paladar**

* **Quente**: Amendoado, banana madura (junto a doçura, me lembra doce de banana com açucar mascavo), manga sutil, licoroso, finalização elegante lembrando amaretto.
* **Morno**: Banana mais evidente, maior percepção da doçura e corpo.
* **Frio**: Acidez baixa, mas me deixou salivando, manga ganhou destaque, amaretto mais intenso com fundo de banana e manga. Finalização longa, prazerosa e persistente.

**Obs**: Senti um leve traço de kiwi, mas muito sutil.

Embora torrado pela Nomad para espresso, preparei no Hario Neo adotando uma abordagem de água leve(15 de tds total, aprox 5ppm de mag+5ppm calcio + 5ppm sódio) + hario neo com filtros cafec T-90, bloom + 1 despejo mirando uma extração de 2 minutos.

Este café foi para mim um excelente exemplo de torra média, sem notas de torra detectáveis.

Arrival in Palermo, check-in and rest (overnight stay only)

May 20th – Palermo → Cefalù

May 30th – San Vito lo Capo → Palermo

May 31st – Palermo + Monreale

June 1st – Palermo → Rome (plane)

My questions are:

A) Would I need a car to do this itinerary? If so, which car rental company do you recommend?

B) On the way there, I will arrive on a 12-hour flight in Rome and then take another flight already booked to Palermo. Would it be better to stay overnight in Palermo and pick up the car/other transport the next day, or do that directly heading towards Cefalu?

C) Is it a good idea to stay overnight in Favignana and leave the car in Trapani, if renting? What is the best place to park in that case?

D) Which restaurants, ice cream shops, and coffee shops do you recommend?

I welcome suggestions for itinerary changes, transport, accommodation, and restaurants.

I just saw a couple kitchens our cabinet guy did where he used pocket doors for the appliance garage or coffee bar. We'd like to use these disappearing doors also, but I've never seen them recessed like his are. His set back about 3/4"" from the face of the surrounding cabinet doors. He's open to learning a different way of installing them, but I'm at a loss. Maybe it's just a hardware issue. I've included a pic of the same type of doors open for reference.

Our cabinets are frameless (full overlay) and will have 1.5"" side panels on both sides to mimic inset doors.

Would really appreciate any input.

1qymnnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1qymnnu/roast_my_system_design_solution_coffee_ordering/,Roast my system design solution: Coffee Ordering System (Salesforce interview question),"

I've been practicing system design by turning my solutions into visual diagrams (helps me think + great for review later).

Here's my attempt at the **Salesforce** ***Coffee Ordering System*** question that's been popping up in interviews:

**\[Infographic attached\]**

**The question asks you to design:** 

* Menu browsing + order placement (pickup/in-store)
* Customizations (size, milk, add-ons) with price calculation
* Payment processing
* Barista queue with status updates (PLACED → IN\_PROGRESS → READY)
* Real-time status for customers
* Scale from 1 store → thousands of stores

**What I covered:**

* Microservices split (Menu, Order, Payment, Notification)
* Event-driven architecture with message queue
* PostgreSQL for orders, NoSQL for menu (read-heavy + cached)
* WebSocket for real-time customer updates
* Idempotency keys, retries, dead letter queue, saga pattern

**Where I'm unsure:**

* Should payment be synchronous or async?
* Is sharding by storeId enough, or should I also consider time-based partitioning for order history?
* How would you handle a barista tablet going offline mid-shift?

**Be brutal, what did I miss?**

Anbar 2006

“Steel Two-One, this is Steel Two-Six. Break.

I need you to link up with Steel One-Two and Steel One-Four at Grid Lima-Delta-51044 04639, on Route Mobile.

“Steel Two-Six, Steel Two-One. Roger. Leaving position now, will link up with One-Two and One-Four. Out.”

About 15 minutes later Two-One came up on the net. 

“Steel Two-Six, Steel Two-One. We’re fifteen mikes into movement, crossing Route Michigan. No contact so far. Over.”

“Roger, Two-One. Keep it tight. Out.”

“CONTACT! CONTACT! IED! IED!”

A loud blast echoed over the open mics and the sound rolled down the dust choked streets; followed by static, yelling and an open mic for several seconds.

Multiple stations key up almost simultaneously. 

“Steel Two-One, this is Steel Two-Six, radio check! Two-One, come back!”

“Steel Two-Six, this is Two-Two, do you have eyes on Two-One?”

“Steel One-Four to Steel Two-Six, we heard the blast, and can see the smoke plume from our position, no comms with Two-One!”

“Steel Two-Six, One-Two, attempting to raise Two-One, negative contact!”

“All Steel elements, break—hold the net! Steel Two-One, if you copy, key up now!”

Static, long uninterrupted and ominous was the only sound on the net.  After several seconds of silence, a different voice cuts in. 

“Steel Two-Six, this is Gunslinger Four-One, over.”

“Gunslinger Four-One, go ahead.”

“Steel Two-Six, be advised, we have visual on Steel Two-One’s element. They are down. Multiple casualties from IED strike. We’re taking sporadic small-arms fire. Request immediate MEDEVAC, over.”

“Roger, Gunslinger Four-One. Stand by. All Steel elements, break—MEDEVAC request incoming. Gunslinger Four-One, mark the  position and secure the LZ. Over.”

“Wilco. Will pop smoke when bird is inbound. Gunslinger Four-One out.”

The personnel report to Division that afternoon would read: Staff Sergeant Mark Halvorsen, call sign Steel Two-One, WIA.

 

The first thing Mark remembered was the high-pitched and relentless  ringing, like a mosquito trapped inside his skull. Everything else sounded wrong, muffled and distant, as if he were listening from underwater.

Hands grabbed him hard, fingers hooked into his kit and started dragging him backward toward the intact Humvee. The gravel scraped and his heels bounced over the stones and debris. Someone tugged at his shoulder and he tried to speak but couldn’t hear his own voice. Then it all snapped back into focus. The noise of small arms fire, in the distance he heard a Humvee accelerating down Route Mobile toward him.  Mark coughed, sharp and violent, sucking in dust and burned air. He turned his head, trying to get his bearings and saw nothing but darkness. His chest tightened as fear gripped him and he raised a hand to his face. There was no pain, which he thought  was strange. His fingers brushed against grit and debris caked on his ballistic glasses. He wiped them clean with the heel of his palm.

The world rushed back in blown-out sunlight, broken pavement, smoke drifting across the road, figures moving with weapons up. Mark let out a shaky breath. “Well,” he muttered to no one in particular, “at least I’m not blind.”  His buddy chuckled and shook his head.

Bandaged and dazed, Staff Sergeant Mark Halvorsen, Steel Two-One, was told it was a concussion, that he’d be good to go in twenty-four hours, but the words barely registered,  his driver SPC Palma and turret gunner  PFC Hansen, were dead. The math of it haunted him immediately, the shoulds, the would-haves, the routes not taken, and it only grew louder as his headaches faded but the guilt didn’t. By redeployment his sleep was gone, the flashbacks constant, and the Army he’d led in was done with him: demoted to specialist, ordered into PTSD counseling, spiraling, that’s what they said about him. The unraveling was fast and unforgiving,. Labeled with discipline issues, paperwork,  and a dishonorable discharge that stripped his VA benefits, Mark disappeared into the margins, another homeless vet carrying a war that never stopped replaying, sharp and bright as the day it took his men. The name printed on his old dog tags read Mark Halvorsen, it was  dulled from wear. Once it was a name you’d hear at a hardware store,  or shouted across a parking lot. A name that belonged to someone who once coached Little League, who once stood in line at the DMV and complained about the weather. A name no one used anymore.

Present Day- THERE IS NO HOMELESS PROBLEM HERE

It was a cold February morning, and the tents went quiet just before dawn. That was how Maggie Collins, a seasoned Community Health Worker, noticed something was wrong, not the noise, but the absence of it. No coughing. No muttered arguments. No radio bleeding through thin nylon walls. Even the dogs were silent, curled tight against the cold. Frost silvered the tarps and cardboard like a skin. Breath smoked in the air as the nearby river moved slowly with minimal sound, as if it was holding its breath awaiting what was about to unfold. Maggie walked the narrow path between tents with her clipboard tucked against her chest, boots careful where the ground softened into mud and old food. Twenty-seven structures, give or take. That was the count she’d written down last month. She hadn’t updated it since. Numbers changed too fast, because people didn’t stay in one place very long. 

A man sat on a milk crate near the back; his shoulders squared despite the cold. An old Carhartt jacket with holes and tears clung to his frame. His jeans were worn, dirty, but still functional. On his feet were old desert combat boots covered in stains and scuffs. He appeared to be in his mid-forties to early fifties.  What hair could be seen peeking out from under the black fleece beanie cap was cropped short in a way that never quite grew out. His hands were wrapped around a dented metal mug , the hot coffee produced a steady stream of steam rising from it in the cold air,  his knuckles were scarred and pale.

She clocked him automatically, veteran, the posture always gave it away along with the stillness and situational awareness that meant he wouldn’t be surprised.  He looked up when she passed, his eyes met hers. He didn’t ask for anything, which was almost worse. She nodded, the way you do when you don’t have time to stop. Maggie told herself she’d circle back, but she didn’t. By nine a.m., Tent City no longer existed.

The mayor said it at the press conference from the sidewalk, where a canopy with a propane space heater was keeping him warm under his expensive wool coat and scarf. He spoke with a smile that suggested patience, the kind reserved for children asking foolish questions. “There is no homeless problem here,” he said, hands wrapped in warm gloves folded neatly atop the podium. “What you’re seeing is a temporary congregation. We’re addressing it.”

Behind him, city workers loaded tarps, collapsed frames and whatever had been left behind into trucks destined for the landfill. A backhoe idled nearby, its engine coughing diesel into the cold air, and then it started clearing the lot, it moved forward and back across the former encampment site, scraping dirt and everything into its bucket, and dumping it on top of the other stuff in the trucks. What didn’t end up in the truck was pushed into a pile at the wood line. Maggie stood at the edge of the crowd, badge clipped to her jacket, arms crossed tight against her. She could smell the fuel. It crawled up her nose and settled behind her eyes. She thought of the man with the mug and wondered if he’d gotten out in time. A single thought kept playing over and over in her head, “This isn’t fair. This isn’t helping.”

A reporter asked about veterans. The mayor nodded solemnly, “We honor our veterans. We have resources available.”  He didn’t specify where. She didn’t expect him to. She knew where the resources were, all of them, and despite their existence, the actual services they provided came with a LOT of conditions, which inevitably meant that many homeless people didn’t ‘qualify’.

Halvorsen watched from the tree line. It was always the same thing. As soon as 3 or 4 found a place to try to eke out a little bit more stable existence, to try and find a shred of normalcy, it was yanked away. Most of the time, they had enough warning and could pack up their stuff and head out. This time, they came early. The police were walking through telling everyone to pack up and leave NOW. It wasn’t a problem for him, he could carry everything he owned in a large army rucksack, and a bag for his tent and sleeping bag. ‘I’m done with being on the losing end of this equation. It has to be balanced, fair. All we asked for was a little compassion, some concern for our well-being, some assistance getting back to a normal life, but the system doesn’t want to help us, they don’t want us to be a part of their society. FINE. They deny me, I’ll deny them the same. No mercy, no compassion.

That afternoon, a body was found. The news broadcast said it was an overdose, a middle-aged male with no fixed address,  and no identification beyond a faded water-damaged VA card in his pocket. The police officer delivering the news spoke gently, the way people do when they want credit for kindness. “Probably drugs,” he said. “Sad, but it happens.”  Maggie recognized the name before he finished the sentence. Her throat tightened. She nodded anyway and didn’t correct him. The name was a ‘frequent flyer’, who had been seen by most of the CHWs. His file was still in the system. The office lights hummed too loudly in the empty office. He file reduced him to data, Intake notes, missed appointments, escalation flags, and behavioral incidents. And in his demographics, there it was, Dishonorable Discharge, it sat there in black type, neat and final. She skimmed fast, faster than she should have, heart ticking in her ears. PTSD diagnosis, intrusive symptoms, Medication discontinued following discharge and Noncompliance.  Her signature was on the referral. She stared at it longer than necessary, then clicked on the “Close File’ button. She told herself she’d done what she could. She told herself a lot of things.

The second death happened three days later.This one wasn’t in Tent City it was downtown, behind the municipal annex.  A contractor in his mid-forties was found slumped beside his truck. No obvious trauma. The news cycle hesitated, then moved on. 

“It was probably a heart attack,” someone said in the break room. “He was a big guy.”

She kept quiet. “a coincidence, maybe?” she thought. 

The contractor smelled like soap and cigarettes and cheap cologne. The man talked too much, voice echoing off brick. Halvorsen doesn’t interrupt. There’s a moment, there is always a moment, where he could step back, where he could leave. That’s the test and the contractor fails it without knowing it exists. Frank had arrived  around 5:00AM, early as usual. He was lucky enough to have his heavy equipment license and the city had plenty of work for him.  He had just poured his coffee into his thermos cup and taken the first sip when he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. Oh, it’s just another homeless guy.  Lately, since they had demolished Tent City, he’d seen them all over downtown.  He was mulling over the idea that maybe they should have just left them there. That way they wouldn’t be all over the place. As he went to take a second drink, a blur of motion caught his attention, but it was too late to react. In a moment a strong hand had clamped over his mouth and nose and the other hand yanked down on his seatbelt, locking him in place. His eyes widened and he tried to thrash about and draw a breath. His lungs burned like fire, his mind screamed do something! Then, gradually, his vision begin to narrow, then blur, and the last thing he thought was no one had come to help him. Later, when it was over, the man’s body looked smaller as if it had folded in on itself. Halvorsen feels nothing in the moment. That comes later.  What he has is a sense of things beginning to balance.",1,1770491679.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1qymkp8,https://i.redd.it/hw4spdpmg4ig1.jpeg,New beans!,"As you can see, Camper Coffee is a newer roaster (est 2023) and they offer a mystery 2-bag deal. Wow. I love these beans. I'm a sucker for Paupa New Guinea beans anyway and these have a very complex, layered flavor profile. Currently sipping my brew I just poured and even fresh and hot it gives BIG fig and date vibes and a lovely cocoa. As it cools, the others flavors start to show up. Just a couple of minutes and the grapes and plum come out to say hi with the hazelnut.

Recipe Kasuya's ""New Hybrid"" 

24g grounds 

385g water

Water at 92°C

Close Switch, add 75g water to bloom.

Open Switch at 30 seconds, let drain for ~15 (total bloom of 45sec)

Pour 100g water once bloom is drained down

Pour 100g more water then close the Switch AFTER drained down

Get some cold water and lower the water temp to 70°C and pour the last 85g and let sit for ~30 sec then draw down

I know it's a bit fussy, but this recipe coaxes so much more flavor out of the beans without extracting tannins at the end there. Really fantastic cup and I'm glad I bought the mystery bags!

1qymk2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1qymk2v/constipation_tips/,Constipation tips,"Hey folks, I've really been haunting this subreddit since my surgery and it seems like constipation is the most common complication everyone has been facing. I've definitely been struggling with it as well but have managed to poop a little bit each day sans the day after surgery, so I wanted to share what I did before and after for those who are coming up on their procedures. I also experienced a thermal injury to my bowel during the surgery so it has been extra important for me to take care of my GI tract during this recovery. 

**I'm not a medical expert so please clear all of this with your doctor before implementing!** 

In the months leading up to surgery I was actually dealing with chronic constipation. Funny enough, coffee actually constipates me but I won't give it up so I had to find ways to counteract. Fiber helped, but my godsend has been Solaray brand probiotics. They're on the pricey side but can you really put a price on being able to poop? These also have helped me a lot with appetite, nausea, general digestion. I've been on them for about 4 months and it has definitely been a huge part of my gut healing journey.

The week before surgery I did meal prep very focused on fiber. Turkey burgers with flax and raisins, spinach, chia seeds, squash, baked pears, buckwheat, and gentle protein like natto and tofu. I do the 80/20 | 90/10 whole foods eating method anyway but ESPECIALLY leading up to the surgery I was focused on high-fiber home-cooked meals. 

3 days before my operation I started taking Miralax (cleared by Dr.) I've continued taking it once or twice a day since. Miralax is by far the gentlest when it comes to clearing out your bowels, I can't recommend it enough. BUT-you have to drink a lot of water with it or it can cause you more problems. Water is just a given anyway so please get your OZs in.

I also saw a lot of people recommending the Smooth Move digestive tea and holy smokes, it works. The package says to drink 1 cup a day but I had 2 cups yesterday and today had an almost normal bowel movement. 

The last thing, and this one's tough, is to basically wait until you feel like you're about to shit yourself before even trying to go to the toilet. I have pelvic floor issues anyway so I avoid straining on the toilet at all costs. It's really uncomfortable to do this but far less uncomfortable than straining so hard you injure a muscle or pull a suture!

I've also been drinking lots of loose-leaf marshmallow, ginger, echinacea, and chamomile tea. 

Once again, I'm not offering this as medical advice but just wanted to share what I've done since my poop situation seems a lot more manageable than most of what I've seen on here. Good luck everyone and wishing you healthy poops!",7,1770491598.0,hysterectomy,1,1.0,False

KZ AJ4
Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants
Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low
Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater
Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",2,1770491400.0,CNFashionBuy,1,1.0,False

I’m traveling to Guate later this year (low season) and Im having a hard time with something and need a little help please. It’s a short trip (3 nights/4 days) for just two of us and I guess I am looking for a local driver/guide recommendation.

I’ll preface this by saying we are both very introverted people and do not do well in group tours. I also get very worn out energy wise after being around a lot of people talking etc. so i do not believe a group tour would work, no matter how small. Masking tends to drain me quite quickly.

Essentially, we are both very low-key travelers who love to wander around and see where that takes us. We tend to have a loose idea of what we want to do/see and then if it happens it happens, if something more magical comes along then we go with it. Food is a huge part of our travels. And we definitely will be eating 80% off our trip lol

That being said, I would like for us to explore Antigua and the beautiful surrounding towns/villages around it to be able to get up close to the volcanoes, mountains, eat local food, ride a horse and/or atv, and drink tons of coffee. I think we would really like Alotenango and Obispo and thought of doing Carmona and/or Cayetano. Maybe Finca Pilar or Amate. Laguna Calderas is interesting, as is Corazon de Agua, Cerro Niño and Pepinaltenango. 

I looked into doing a private tour, but can’t find what I am looking for, and have been thinking I need to look into a mix of DIY plus hiring a local driver/guide etc so that we can learn about Antigua’s history etc. along the way. But i am in a less tour-y way if that makes sense? 

With it being a short trip, we wont be able to do the regular hikes and actually, we prefer going off the beaten path. I havent yet booked our airport transfers so I thought maybe looking into this could be two birds one stone

I apologize if this is a bit haphazard, English can be quite hard sometimes! If there is any clarification needed please let me know! Thank you for your help! ",1,1770491171.0,centralamerica,1,1.0,False

Just looking to meet similar chill people, maybe grab coffee or sit somewhere low key nearby and talk about random stuff. No grand plans, no “networking,” no forced energy. Just normal conversation.

Work in IT, so I spend most of my time behind screens. Figured I should occasionally interact with real humans.

1qymbty,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qymbty/it_was_one_of_those_nights_part_3/,It Was One of Those Nights (Part 3/?),"My search for Benny wasn't going as well as I hoped. Benny was the guy you went to when looking for party favors, if you catch my drift. He was 'the man to see'. Yet you had to catch him around as he prowled the streets like a cat in the shadows. He never gives his number out but only to exclusive people, that being the girls he will pine over. The man is paranoid of the government listening in on his phone calls. He still goes with the burner phone methods. I asked around to various people I know he does dealings with. They couldn't give me any absolute answers on where to locate him at this time of day which is he was most likely sleeping at home. He was scarce about giving his address as well, preventing too many people from coming to his place of residence in search of drugs. Understandably so, I wouldn't want that attention either. But for a dealer, he was hard to make contact with. But from what I understand he always has the 'best' stuff. He's like a phantom that appears only when you're in need and disappears in the night to someone else he magically senses has money they want to spend to make their partying more fun. I mainly know him from Jolly Jack's being his 'breakroom' from work. We are both mildly competitive on the pool tables.

All I can remember from last night was walking into Jolly's just before sunset, saying my hellos to everyone there, and ordering my first round. Benny was already there saying he was 'taking the night off'.

""Damn man, I need chill out tonight. My feet are killing me from all this trot'n around dealing with these spoiled college kids."", he complained on.

""Dude, your making stacks. Why are you complaining? It's your own fault you don't deal from home."", I said to him as I readied the rack for a game.

""Yah but I gotta watch my ass man. I'm not trying to get caught up and go back to jail again."", he explained as he took a shot of tequila down his gullet and ordered another for him and myself. He was feeling chipper having made out good the night before and was basking people he felt close with to share in his wealth. I last remember him handing me the tiny glass filled of amber liquid, the sound of the tink from both our glasses colliding, and shooting the burning alcohol down my throat.

My only lead was the ex-girlfriend I had mentioned before. Wanda I believe her name was. She works at a coffee shop near the hookah lounge not far from Hole. It was maybe a few minutes from where I was currently at. I made my way there in the midday sun shining down over me, stopping for some ice cream. You can tell summer was around the corner with the way the heat was today. Perfect time for a frigid treat. As I made my way drawing closer to Wanda's coffee shop, sliding my tongue along the frozen creme, I was bumped into by a random stranger resulting in smashing the cone filled treat right onto my shirt and it dropping to the scolding sidewalk riddled in filth now.

""Hey! What the hell?!"", I turned back yelling. The person never turning around themselves, kept walking on. They were wearing a black hooded coat. ""Who the hell wears a hoodie this time of year"", I said out loud to myself. ""Weirdo!"", I hollered to them hoping they would turn around to see the rightful finger gesture I was flaunting in their direction. No response. What a day.

Wanda was not too ecstatic to my sudden intrusion at her work place to discuss her ex, let alone me getting her name wrong. It was Wendy by the way. I told her I wouldn't leave the line unless she told me where I could find Benny, then convinced me to buy their most expensive drink on the menu in order to obtain said information. I don't even drink coffee. I threw the brew filled cup away as I exited the shop heading off to my next destination. Benny's address led me to an apartment complex that was oddly shaped. You would say the architect had inspiration from modern day Russian avant-garde structures. To me, it looked like a mess of concrete. A place where scientist with no morals do horrible top secret experiments. Benny's front door looked like a hole in the wall. I knocked a few times and stood very still to hear if there was any activity within. Some faint rustling at first, then the quick sounds of metal clunks and claps. The door flung slightly ajar stopping from the chain link hooked on the other side.

""Yeah! What you want?"", I could hear the paranoia in his tone as he shown only one half of his face to me. The only eye of his I could see as he peered out was bloodshot and veiny. The part of his face sneaking around from the door seemed pale like he was severely sick.

""Hey Benny. It's me Ray. I gotta talk to you about last night."", I answered him.

""Last night?! What about last night?!""

""Can I come in for a minute?"", I asked him. ""I just want to talk. I'm not here to deal or nothing."" He stood there for a few seconds waving his eye up and down examining me, like he didn't know me. He slammed the door and I heard the sound of metal jingling from the chain lock. He waved the door back open popping his head out to look around like he was checking the perimeter for intruders. I took notice to the bandage at his neck. He rushed me inside shutting and locking the door behind us. He was dressed a little too comfortably for guests wearing nothing but his boxers and socks.

""Dude, what happened last night? Did you drug me? Because I'm having a hard time remembering much after I seen you at Jolly's and now I'm getting sudden flashbacks of terrible shit I think."", I asked as I watched him fiddle with the multitude of locks on his door. Talk about paranoia. He flew past me into a small living room. Taking a good look around his place, it was cozy. Like something you would see out of a living quarters in Tokyo but it was like a trailer apartment. I could see the series of rooms through each doorway. A kitchen next, then the bedroom and lastly a bathroom at the end. He sat down on his couch then crouched forward to overlook his masterpiece. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He had made a pentagram symbol completely made from lines of cocaine. A kilo brick sat atop the coffee table sliced open. ""Dude! What the fuck is this?""

""Nothing works! I...I can't feel anything."", he replied sobbingly. He quickly darts his attention back to myself. ""He didn't get you did he?"", his eyes were as big as fifty cent pieces. The red glowed within them. I could see the twitch in his lips and eyelids.

""Who didn't get me? What happened last night Benny?""

""I'm sorry...Ray."", a tear escaped his eye. ""I fucked up!""

""Shh shh shh, it's alright man. Just chill out."", my feeble attempt to calm him down. He reached for the homemade bandage below his left side jaw. It was a blood soaked stacked of folded paper towels and tan colored band-aids used to hold it in place.

""Fucker thought he got me, but I...I got away."", his hand leaving the bandage and going for the straw sitting next the demonic logo of pure snow. He vacuumed a portion of the circle going from one point of the star to the next.

""Dude! What are you doing?!""

""I'm making a deal with the devil! To heal me! I can't...feel anymore!"", his voice was full of dread and fear. ""I took my whole stash and not a thing! No trip! No buzz! Natta!!"" I could see the various sizes and colored empty baggies spread all over the table and floor. Was he trying to put himself in an overdose? He then began to wrap his arms around his stomach and starting writhing back and forth. The gurgling sounds coming from his belly were loud and piercing to my ears. ""AAAGH! What's wrong with me?!""

""Ok. Dude, let's keep it calm. Where's your phone? I broke mine earlier. We gotta get you to a hospital man. I can call 911 for you...""

""NO!"", he interrupted me flying to the door and clinging to it like every force in the world was trying to open it. His paranoid state of mind was getting the best of him. ""I...cant go out there...I can't."" He clung back to his stomach then began coughing uncontrollably, falling to his knees as he kept himself up on one arm. Blood came with each cough now. He groaned in pain, but his voice sounded deeper. ""I...cant...Ray!"", he creaks his head back to look up at my face. His eyes turned glossy and reflective. Showing a smile, his teeth were jagged and sharpened like a feral creature. Silence conquered the room.

I stood there locking eyes with what I thought was still Bernard. His own blood ran from his lips making him look like a drooling mental patient. Each breath we emitted together were long and heavy. I've never felt so scared like this in my entire life. My senses were heightened beyond my belief, feeling every trinkle from the flow of the sweat streaming down my brow. The pounding of my heartbeat was running a concert of it's own in my ears. My feet were like condensed springs ready to zip out of the reaches of whatever danger this thing opposed to me. Benny leapt up trying to pin me against the wall to my back, my instincts being as sharp as they are, fled me away in time from his attempt and through each door to the bathroom. I shut the door and leaned hard against it as he pounded and clawed on the other side. I look to the small window in front of me determining if I was too big to fit through it. I really had no choice. Making a quick decision, I jump into the tub/shower letting Benny make his way inside. As he opens the door, last he see's myself utilizing the shower curtain bar to hurl myself up and feet forward plunging him back with the dropkick I had delivered onto his chest. As fast I as could, I got the window open in enough time to try my way out. Barely being able to squeeze through, I flinched and swerved my leg when I could feel Benny grabbing for one of my sneakers, claiming it in the process. Thank goodness his place was at ground level for the fall wasn't too bad say for landing on my leg wrong. Benny was then frantically crawling his was out the window next, hissing and growling, his eyes locked onto me like a predator after his prey. I was hopping away, trying to ignore the pain from my leg, but Benny got out of the window a lot faster than myself, sprinting like an olympian going for the gold as he landed squarely on his feet. The sun blinded me momentarily as I left the shade of the apartment building and Benny thrust himself on me to the hard paved ground.

The struggle didn't last long, as we flailed about for a few seconds then I began to smell the burning of flesh. I knew that smell from my former life growing up in the farmlands. When we would burn the bodies of diseased live stock. Benny wailed and cried out as his body began to char and catch flame. I pushed him off me and desperately army crawled away from him, watching as he lit up like a bonfire that got gasoline freshly poured on it. His screaming echoed into the atmosphere as it faded to low a crackling and he then turned to dust, scattering to the wind. There was a burn mark left over on the concrete outlined of his body, like a chalked man at a crime scene.",2,1770491075.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’m honestly curious how people here feel about this. Dating lately just feels… heavy. So much pressure, expectations, timelines, and trying to figure out chemistry at lightning speed. Sometimes it feels like everyone’s already tired before anything even starts.

I totally get that most people are here because they want an actual partner, not another buddy. That’s fair. But is there any room for something simpler? Good conversation, laughs, maybe coffee — without the pressure of “where is this going?”

1qyma2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/GardeningAustralia/comments/1qyma2a/we_stopped_binning_food_scraps_and_the_worms_are/,We stopped binning food scraps and the worms are LOVING it,"We’ve started dumping all our veg scraps, banana peels, used tea and coffee grounds straight into the backyard instead of the bin. We go through about 13–15 bananas a week, and whenever I see a spare spot in the soil I just dig a small hole, throw the scraps in, and cover it up.

Today I dug into one of the spots from a couple of weeks ago because I wanted to plant something there and found 20+ earthworms going nuts in that area. I’m ridiculously happy about it – all that stuff used to just go to landfill, and now it’s clearly feeding the soil instead.

I’ve watched a few composting videos but proper bins and turning piles still feel like too much effort for us right now. For anyone else who’s lazy like me, is this “bury it where you can” approach basically fine long-term? Any tips on how deep to bury or how long to wait before planting on those spots?",10,1770490966.0,GardeningAustralia,5,0.92,False
1qym9z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qym9z7/i_built_an_openclaw_in_pure_go_12mb_binary_20mb/,"I built an ""OpenClaw"" in pure Go — 12MB binary, 20MB RAM, runs on a $5 VPS","Hello r/golang!

Every open-source AI agent framework out there — OpenClaw, NanoClaw, you name it — is built with Python or Node.js. 500MB Docker images. 1GB RAM at idle. A dependency tree longer than your **go.sum**.

I keep thinking — **why is nobody building this in Go?**

So I built **Picobot**. A full AI agent — persistent memory, built-in tools, skills system, Telegram integration — in a **single \~12MB binary** that uses **\~20MB RAM** and boots in milliseconds.

What can it actually do?

It's not just a chatbot — it's a personal agent that takes action:

""Remember that I'm allergic to peanuts and I prefer window seats""

**→ Saved to memory. It'll remember this forever — even after restarts.**

""Remind me every Monday at 9am to submit my timesheet""

**→ Done. Cron job created. You'll get a Telegram ping every Monday.**

""Create a grocery list file and add milk, eggs, and coffee""

**→ File created at \~/grocery-list.txt. Want me to add anything else?**

""Learn how to check Bitcoin price using curl, and check it every hour""

**→ Skill created. Cron scheduled. You'll get hourly updates on Telegram.**

All of this from your phone via Telegram — talking to your own private agent running on a $5 VPS.

Almost pure Go

Only one external dependency — *spf13/cobra* for CLI. Everything else is standard library. Telegram Bot API? Raw **net/http**. JSON? **encoding/json**. No CGO. No bloat. Just **go build** and deploy it to any box.

Runs on anything

Raspberry Pi. A $5 Hetzner VPS. An old Android phone via Termux. If it runs Linux, it runs Picobot.

Works with OpenAI compatible API (By default:  OpenRouter + Ollama)

GitHub: [https://github.com/louisho5/picobot](https://github.com/louisho5/picobot)

A star on the repo would mean a lot. Feedback and issues all welcome.

1qym9p0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qym9p0,Should I pursue this?,"Apologies, not really bumble related, just curious other peoples thoughts. I used to work with this girl about 2 years ago in a professional environment before she moved to another company. We weren't close, just talked a bit as colleagues, but I still have her on instagram. She had a boyfriend at the time who I assume is no longer around as any pictures with him were removed from her profile. Anyway, a few weeks ago I sent a comment about one of her stories, we talked a little, but I assume by her not asking any questions or trying to continue the conversation that she isn't really interested, or it just doesn't even cross her mind. We're both 27.

Like I said we were never close, I just started dating again recently and I just remember she's nice, cute, intelligent, and overall a good person, so it has me wondering about it lately. I feel like if I just ask her if she wants to get coffee sometime it's sort of out of the blue.

Should I leave it alone? Or how would you pursue this?",2,1770490945.0,Bumble,16,0.67,False

Chapter **1** 

**“**Congrats, Archer**!** One at home, one on the side!” 

I froze. 

I was booking a recovery suite for my baby when those words shattered everything. 

The man who knelt and swore I was his only one? He was in **there**. Cradling a baby that wasn’t ours. 

His kid. With her. 

For three years, I played the perfect wife. Trusting. Devoted. Blind. 

Turns out**,** I was the city’s favorite punchline. 

He thought the baby in my belly was his insurance–his way to keep me locked down forever. 

Wrong. 

It became my ticket out. 

I’m taking my child and walking straight into the life we actually deserve. 

As for Archer? 

Poor bastard still doesn’t know his precious mistress’s baby? 

Yeah. NOT HIS. 

Three years after remarrying Archer Kingsley, Helena Vaughan found out she was pregnant. 

She rubbed her belly, doing everything in her power to avoid another blow–up fight with him. 

If he came home late, she didn’t ask questions. 

If he stumbled in drunk, she simply had the housekeeper whip up some aspirin and black coffee. 

If he was buried in work, she gave him space. 

Even when she found a tube of lipstick on his passenger seat, she thoughtfully slid it right back where she found it. 

It wasn’t until she went to book a suite at the Luxury Postpartum Retreat and caught him cheating again that she realized the burning hatred 

was gone–replaced by a cold, dead numbness. 

“Ms. Vaughan**,** look at this! This is our VIP Diamond Suite, running about twenty grand a month! A ‘Mrs. Kingsley‘ is staying here right

The sales associate **kept** chirping in her ear, but Helena tuned out every single word. 

She stared into the room at the man cradling a newborn, shooting the breeze with his **frat** brothers, and **felt** a **hot** sting in her eyes.

“Congrats, Archer! Another heir to the throne!” 

“If Helena pops out a boy too, that makes two sons for the dynasty, huh?” 

“Man, Archer is a legend. One at home, one on the side. Three whole years, and I bet Helena doesn’t have a clue, does she?**”** 

Hearing this, Archer’s expression hardened. “Of course she doesn’t know, and don’t you idiots dare let it slip! She’s in her third trimester, she 

can’t handle the stress.” 

“We get it, bro, we get it! We’ve covered for you for three years, but Archer, when are you gonna drop the bomb on Helena?” 

Archer paused for a second before speaking with absolute certainty, “I’ll wait until after the delivery. Once the baby is here, Helena won’t have the heart to leave me.” 

“Am I making things hard for you?” The woman in bed cooed softly. “Archer, I never wanted to be a burden. After Caleb died, just being by your side and giving you a child is enough for me. I don’t need anything else.” 

He reached out, pulling her into a gentle embrace. “Cecily, I promised I’d take care of you**,** and I keep my promises. I just hate that you’ve had to live in the shadows with me for three years.” 

Through the crack in the door, Helena watched the man–usually so cold and composed–looking utterly tender, and a mocking smirk twisted her lips. 

Three years ago, Helena had seen with her own eyes how Archer hooked up with his dead best friend’s wife. 

She screamed for a divorce, Cecily Quinn threatened suicide. 

Between the two of them, Archer chose Cecily. 

Not long after the divorce, Archer scoured the earth to find Helena. 

When he finally tracked her down, he got on his knees and swore she was the only woman he had ever loved. 

He claimed the divorce was forced, that he was terrified Cecily would actually kill herself, and he couldn’t bear to fail his late best friend. 

To put her mind at ease, he even shipped Cecily straight overseas. 

He even held a press conference, promising the entire world he would never betray her again. 

Ten years of knowing him, five years of loving him. 

Helena couldn’t just turn off her feelings, so she caved and agreed to remarry him. 

After the wedding, Archer went overboard trying to make it up to her. 

She liked fireworks, so for her birthday, he bought out the city’s entire supply and lit up the skyline all night long. 

If she eyed a piece of jewelry, no matter the astronomical price tag, he’d win the auction and have it on her vanity the next day. 

Afraid she felt insecure, he’d share his location proactively, no matter where he went. 

Even on business trips**,** he’d call three or four times a day just to check in. 

But ever since the incident, she couldn’t stop picturing him cheating. 

To save the marriage, she tried to change**,** giving him freedom within reason.

And she certainly never expected him to have a child with her. 

It wasn’t until this moment that Helena realized just how incredibly played she had been.

The sales associate **kept** chirping in her ear, but Helena tuned out every single word. 

She stared into the room at the man cradling a newborn, shooting the breeze with his **frat** brothers, and **felt** a **hot** sting in her eyes.

“Congrats, Archer! Another heir to the throne!” 

“If Helena pops out a boy too, that makes two sons for the dynasty, huh?” 

“Man, Archer is a legend. One at home, one on the side. Three whole years, and I bet Helena doesn’t have a clue, does she?**”** 

Hearing this, Archer’s expression hardened. “Of course she doesn’t know, and don’t you idiots dare let it slip! She’s in her third trimester, she 

can’t handle the stress.” 

“We get it, bro, we get it! We’ve covered for you for three years, but Archer, when are you gonna drop the bomb on Helena?” 

Archer paused for a second before speaking with absolute certainty, “I’ll wait until after the delivery. Once the baby is here, Helena won’t have the heart to leave me.” 

“Am I making things hard for you?” The woman in bed cooed softly. “Archer, I never wanted to be a burden. After Caleb died, just being by your side and giving you a child is enough for me. I don’t need anything else.” 

He reached out, pulling her into a gentle embrace. “Cecily, I promised I’d take care of you**,** and I keep my promises. I just hate that you’ve had to live in the shadows with me for three years.” 

Through the crack in the door, Helena watched the man–usually so cold and composed–looking utterly tender, and a mocking smirk twisted her lips. 

Three years ago, Helena had seen with her own eyes how Archer hooked up with his dead best friend’s wife. 

She screamed for a divorce, Cecily Quinn threatened suicide. 

Between the two of them, Archer chose Cecily. 

Not long after the divorce, Archer scoured the earth to find Helena. 

When he finally tracked her down, he got on his knees and swore she was the only woman he had ever loved. 

He claimed the divorce was forced, that he was terrified Cecily would actually kill herself, and he couldn’t bear to fail his late best friend. 

To put her mind at ease, he even shipped Cecily straight overseas. 

He even held a press conference, promising the entire world he would never betray her again. 

Ten years of knowing him, five years of loving him. 

Helena couldn’t just turn off her feelings, so she caved and agreed to remarry him. 

After the wedding, Archer went overboard trying to make it up to her. 

She liked fireworks, so for her birthday, he bought out the city’s entire supply and lit up the skyline all night long. 

If she eyed a piece of jewelry, no matter the astronomical price tag, he’d win the auction and have it on her vanity the next day. 

Afraid she felt insecure, he’d share his location proactively, no matter where he went. 

Even on business trips**,** he’d call three or four times a day just to check in. 

But ever since the incident, she couldn’t stop picturing him cheating.

But she never **in** a million years imagined that the man who swore he sent Cecily away had been tangled up with her for three whole years, 

And she certainly never expected him to have a child with her. 

It wasn’t until this moment that Helena realized just how incredibly played she had been. 

Even if she gave him trust, and he gave her love, a shattered mirror could never truly be fixed. 

The kicker was, Helena knew every single person in that room–no exceptions. 

If Archer hadn’t suddenly announced a month–long business trip, leaving her bored enough to check out this retreat alone, she never would 

have stumbled onto this circus. 

She would have been kept in the dark like a damn fool for the rest of her life! 

What a massive, elaborate con Archer had pulled! 

How could he lie to her three years ago, and then have the nerve to do it all over again?! 

Perhaps sensing Helena’s rage, the baby in her belly suddenly kicked–hard. 

She clutched her stomach, doubling over in pain. “Ah! That hurts.” 

It wasn’t just her belly, it was her heart. 

The sales girl noticed something was off and nervously grabbed her arm. “Ms. Vaughan? You okay? Is something wrong?**”** 

“Who’s out there?”

I’m honestly curious how people here feel about this. Dating lately just feels… heavy. So much pressure, expectations, timelines, and trying to figure out chemistry at lightning speed. Sometimes it feels like everyone’s already tired before anything even starts.

I totally get that most people are here because they want an actual partner, not another buddy. That’s fair. But is there any room for something simpler? Good conversation, laughs, maybe coffee — without the pressure of “where is this going?”

1qym7wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1qym7wg/day_5/,Day 5,"A little context. I started using nicotine (chew, cigarettes) at about 12 years old. I always LOVED it. I never really wanted to quit. Started smoking weed around 16. Just continued on. 

Well in my mid 20s, my girlfriend was pregnant and I was determined to live a long life with my child. I quit nicotine for the first time in my life. I still smoked weed, but I felt pretty good about that, it was clearly a substitute for a bigger dependency though. Still I hadn’t seen weed as anything negative really. Well, we lost our son 2 weeks after he was born due to a traumatic birth. I spiraled hard.

I started drinking, smoking weed, and using nicotine, fully aware I was just trying to numb my pain. Luckily I never had good associations with any harder drugs. But as soon as I learned about Zyn I thought they were a godsend. I quit smoking immediately and went all in on Zyn. 

8 years later I now have a family, and have been a stepfather to three amazing children for the past 7. I love my life. But I could never shake those old habits. I drank every night, smoked weed, and regulated everything with nicotine.

But I’m finally done. I quit drinking, quit smoking weed. And finally, lastly, after nearly 25 years of addiction, have stopped using nicotine. Obviously I’m only 5 days in as the title suggests, but there’s nothing in the world that would make me go back. I’ve never known true sobriety even though I told myself for years that I would someday achieve it. 

The thing about Zyn is, it’s so easy to use. You associate it with everything, relaxation, morning coffee, stressful moment, celebration, focus. So when you quit you gotta go through all that and let your nervous system regulate itself. It’s tough, but if my weak ass that couldn’t muster up the courage for 25 years to quit can get through it, you can too. Every single day gets easier.

Anyway, this is me celebrating having no substances in my body. 

Live a long life, save your money, and have complete agency over yourself.

I planned a coffee date (didn't plan a nice dinner or a hike or something like I usually would), named the location, and settled on a time and date. I checked in the day before the date to confirm if we were still on and they said yes.

1qym6n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1qym6n6/24_m4f_scotland_childfree_antitheist_frugal/,"24 [M4F] Scotland - Childfree, Antitheist, Frugal, Tech-Savvy, Eastern European. Aiming for Early Retirement. Detailed Compatibility Guide Inside.","Hi there. I am a 24-year-old living in Scotland. I am looking for a long-term partner with whom to retire (ideally early 😉).

To make things as clear as possible, I have organized my preferences into the categories below. I value directness, so I want to be upfront about what I am looking for to save us both time.

**Important Note on Reciprocity:**

* **Two-Way Mirror:** Everything I am asking for below, I reciprocate. I am not looking for an unequal dynamic. You can view this list as a description of what I look for, but also a description of exactly what I am like. For example, if I list alcohol as a red light, it is because I do not drink either.
* **Verification:** I am happy to exchange photos, my name, and answer any other questions you have privately.

**My Age Range:** 18-34. *Note: The closer you are to my age (24), the more willing I am to be flexible on the ""Yellow"" points below.*

**The Key:**

🔴 **Red:** Non-negotiable / Dealbreaker.

🟡 **Yellow:** Negotiable, but indicates a difference in priorities. It is something I see as important, but it is not a dealbreaker.

🟢 **Green:** Preference, but I do not care much as long as it works for you.

# 🏢 Core Values, Location & Background

🔴 **Childfree:** I am strictly childfree. No children now, and no children in the future.

🔴 **Monogamy:** Looking for a heterosexual, monogamous, long-term relationship. Anything else is a no-go.

🔴 **Religion:** I am an Antitheist. Ideally, you are an Antitheist, Atheist, or Agnostic. *If you are religious, it is a Red light unless it is private to the point where I wouldn't know unless I asked.*

🟡 **Political Views:** If you are curious about my economic and political worldview, check out Gary Stevenson (Garys Economics) on YouTube. My views align almost perfectly with his - including the part about wearing a tracksuit and sneakers everywhere 😂.

🟡 **Location:** I currently live in Scotland and I really enjoy it here. I prefer quiet towns like the one I live in or rural areas over big cities. *I like to have ""civilization"" at a hand distance with good transit links - high-speed internet and reliable delivery services are great to have too. Ideally, I am looking for someone willing to relocate here, and I am ready to make that process as smooth as possible for the right person. While I am quite rooted here, me moving elsewhere is difficult - though not impossible - depending on the circumstances. We can discuss this in further detail if things reach that point.*

🟢 **Cultural Background:** I prefer someone from Eastern Europe (former Warsaw Pact + Yugoslavia) as I am from there originally. *It is a big bonus as you probably can relate to unique shared experiences like listening to the neighbors above you arguing while you are in the toilet in the morning, the sunflower seed shells ingrained in the concrete in front of the block entrance, stories about bananas and oranges being luxury items only available at Christmas, hearing about what tank or BTR your grandfather operated in the military - or watching cartoons like Nu Pogodi and Cheburashka as a kid.*

*To be clear, I am not looking to relocate back to Eastern Europe at this stage. I generally dislike hot climates, so I will most likely never move back to the Balkans. Moving further north is a* ***very big maybe*** *- it is highly uncertain if I would actually want to do that, even if asked.*

# 🏠 Lifestyle & Habits

🔴 **Smoking/Drugs:** No smoking, drugs, or marijuana.

* Only negotiable if you are actively ready to quit.
* Medical marijuana is acceptable. I am never against something that a doctor has prescribed.

🔴/🟡 **Alcohol:** Alcoholism is a dealbreaker. Occasional social drinking (without getting drunk) is acceptable. I do not drink at all.

🟡 **Transportation:** I am against car use; I view them as expensive and unnecessary where public transport exists. I do not have a license and do not plan to get one.

🟡 **Pets:** I do not have a pet at the moment, but I definitely want one - most likely a Ragdoll cat 😼. If you already have one, amazing. *My favorite animal, however, is a sloth 🦥. I am open to all types of animals except reptiles, snakes, and other cold-blooded animals. If you do not want pets, or especially if you are allergic, this is something I am absolutely ready to compromise on for the right person.*

🟡/🟢 **Caffeine/Energy Drinks:** I personally dislike the taste and smell of coffee, and I believe energy drinks are unhealthy, so I don't consume them. *If you are addicted or consume a lot of caffeine and/or energy drinks, I view that as a negative. Moderate consumption is fine.*

🟢 **Diet:** I am almost exclusively a meat-eater. *I truly do not care what your diet is. You can be vegan, vegetarian, plastic eater, or anything else. My only requirement is that you are comfortable with the fact that I eat meat.*

🟢 **Fitness:** I prefer someone who doesn't go to the gym, and especially someone who isn't a ""gym enthusiast"". I personally do not go to the gym.

🟢 **Outdoors:** I am happy at home and almost never go outside solo for ""no purpose"" walks, unless I am meeting with a friend. *I am very happy to go on hikes, walks, picnics, travel, or other outdoor activities with a partner. I just don't do it alone.*

# 💰 Financial Independence & Early Retirement

🟡 **Financial Independence (FIRE):** I live frugally and am looking forward to early retirement in my early 30s (not 50s). *Frugality to me does not mean buying cheap junk. I fully believe in ""buy once, cry once"" - I prefer buying expensive, high-quality items that last. However, I will try to find these items as cheaply as possible at all costs (using promo codes, work perks, student discounts, etc.). It is a big bonus if you are also pursuing FIRE.*

🟡 **Financial Responsibility:** No credit card debt or unsecured high-interest loans. *Mortgages, student loans, or low-interest loans used for interest arbitrage are a huge plus. A mortgage shows you have worked hard to secure housing; a student loan likely means you are educated and aiming for a high-paying career; and if you are using interest arbitrage, even just knowing what that is shows you are highly financially literate.*

*Debt resulting from situations entirely outside your control is understandable, provided that if you are now in a position to handle it, you are actively working to pay it off.*

🟡 **Career Ambition:** I am generally not looking for someone overly ambitious who chases ""get rich quick"" schemes or unstable side hustles. *If you are in a difficult financial position, I view doing whatever it takes to survive (side hustles, etc.) as a positive trait - it shows grit. However, if you have a stable job and risk losing it for uncertain ""big money,"" I view that negatively.*

*I view most business ventures as a statistical waste of time because they usually fail. I prefer putting up with work for about 10 years to retire guaranteed, rather than risking that stability on a venture. If the business fails (which is statistically likely), you have wasted years where you could have been working a normal job, pushing your freedom back further as you try to recoup the losses.*

# 💻 Interests, Hobbies & Media

🟡 **Tech Savvy:** It is a really big bonus from a lifestyle perspective if you are tech-savvy. *It is also a big bonus if you are familiar with software piracy (YouTube Revanced, Stremio, FMHY) or reverse engineering. If you have used IDA or x64dbg, you definitely have my attention. My work is in technology (I have a Master's in Computing Science) and my main hobbies are coding and video games, so this is a shared ground.*

🟡 **Information Consumption:** I prefer non-fiction, science, technology, and documentaries. I view books/novels as a ""slow medium"" compared to the efficiency of forums, videos, AI bots, and Google. *I verify information and do not use AI bots blindly - I won't be putting glue on my pizza just because a chatbot said so.*

🟡 **Fictional Fixation:** I prefer someone who does not get fixated on fictional worlds or novels. *I find it difficult to care about the actions of fictional characters. Since they are unreal and their actions are just arbitrary setups by a writer, analyzing them feels pointless and intangible to me. I view discussing them as simply playing into a scenario the writer expected to happen, rather than discussing reality. Given my cynical view of purely fictional narratives (as opposed to documentaries or media based on real events), I tend to look at things laconically - I just see the big picture the author wants to present (e.g., ""lying never pays off"") and ignore the rest as an arbitrary setup.*

🟡 **Celebrity Culture:** I view celebrities as regular people on equal footing, not idols. I am not looking for someone who is obsessed with celebrities or follows them religiously in parasocial way.

🟡 **Nightlife:** I am not a fan of nightclubs - I see a big cultural disconnect there regarding the environment. *I dislike the culture surrounding heavy drug usage, excessive alcohol consumption, and repetitive electronic music without lyrics. I enjoy going to pubs and concerts. However, if a concert is held inside a nightclub, I still consider it a nightclub environment with all the associated culture I dislike, so I am not interested.*

🟡 **Arts/Creativity:** I am looking for someone ""grounded"" rather than someone ""artsy"" or creative. I am not a fan of theaters, musicals, or operas. *While I generally see myself meshing better with practical/grounded people, I acknowledge that sometimes opposites attract - perhaps even better than two similar people. I am open to being surprised here, so consider the yellow point here to be a bit more murky.*

🟡/🟢 **Travel:** I love to travel (mostly Europe, but open to elsewhere), but I prefer budget travel (Ryanair, Airbnb) over luxury resorts. *Currently, work limits how often I can go. Once I retire, I am happy to travel as much as possible.*

🟢 **Languages:** English is fine. *It would make me really happy if you spoke Bulgarian, Czech, or Russian though, as I speak them too (each to a varying extent). I can read few other languages too*

# 👗 Appearance & Presentation

🔴 **Hygiene:** Poor hygiene is a strictly non-negotiable dealbreaker.

🔴 **Solariums:** I am strictly against solarium or tanning bed use. I view it as paying to blast yourself with cancer just to look like a carrot.

🔴 **Tattoos/Piercings:** No tattoos or piercings. Small/few tattoos or simple earrings are okay, but I prefer without.

🟡 **Make-up/Cosmetics:** I view make-up, nails, and cosmetics as a waste of resources (time, money, and mental energy). It is not because I care for looks (quite the contrary). It is because I dislike the social pressure that forces their use. *Yielding to that pressure conflicts with my views regarding nonconformism. If you apply make-up as a form of ""art"" or self-expression rather than for social pressure, that is valid, but it then conflicts with my preference for a non-artistic person mentioned earlier.*

🟡 **Fashion/Trends:** Similar to my stance on make-up, I view obsessing over fashion trends, brand names, and constantly changing wardrobes as superficial. *I value utility and comfort over aesthetics. To give you an idea: I currently own three pairs of unbranded sneakers that I bought brand new together for £2.40 total, and they are really nice and comfortable. If you spend a lot of time and money trying to keep up with the latest styles primarily to fit in or impress others, I view that as a fundamental incompatibility driven by social pressure.*

🟡 **Physique:** I do not care about height or weight, as long as you have a BMI in the healthy range or there about. *Mine is 20, so the closer to that, the better.*

🟢 **Clothing:** I wear casual clothing (tracksuits) pretty much everywhere. Honestly, I would be happy to marry in one 😂. *I prefer a partner who is happy with my strong preference to avoid formal wear whenever possible. I am not completely refusing to do it if the situation strictly demands it, but I will avoid it if I can.*

**Final Note:**

I understand this is a very specific list. I am not expecting everyone to like it - just the right person. You might have views or values I haven't considered, so please, go ahead and ask me anything!

Given how much information I have provided here to save us both time, I would appreciate it if you could send a bit of information about yourself in your message so I can get a feel for who you are. I look forward to hearing from you!",0,1770490759.0,cf4cf,0,0.25,False

KZ AJ4
Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants
Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low
Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater
Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770490661.0,acbuyhelp,2,1.0,False

1qym2xh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qym2xh,Two Weeks In: Raw Thoughts on a Full Reps Bundle,"Picked up this mix last month—wore everything through commutes, errands, and lazy weekends. Zero staging, zero fluff. Just honest notes.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770490517.0,FrenchyReps,1,1.0,False
1qym293,https://www.reddit.com/r/askanything/comments/1qym293/how_do_people_meet_other_people_in_your_30s_and/,How do people meet other people in your 30’s and older?,"First thing, I hate dating apps. There’s something about talking to someone on an app that an algorithm connected you with just seems so artificial. I’ve tried it and it’s just so hard for me to keep a conversation going or even break the ice because of this. It’s not genuine for me.

I also work in a heavily male dominated industry. Not that I’m a fan of dating coworkers, even if that was my choice it wouldn’t be feasible. I work in construction so everyone seems to be on their 4th or 5th marriage. 

I have also found bars to be the worst place to look for genuine connection. Maybe a quick one like fling, but that’s not my type of game.

I often spend my weekends going to libraries, parks, coffee shops etc. but in the U.S. at least, people seem put off when approached by strangers so I’m very reluctant to just start talking to someone. More often than not, many people go out with friends or loved ones, so it seems I’m always by myself when everyone else has the company of someone else. 

So I’m looking to hear from other people’s experiences on how they meet new people when they’re in their 30’s and work full time. I’m starting to feel lonely and isolated. ",1,1770490470.0,askanything,1,1.0,False

At first I was really thrilled and grateful for the manager taking a chance on me and giving me this opportunity to progress my skills, especially after absolutely bombing my interview. All the responsibilities expected of me seemed reasonable, and there was nothing I wasn't already familiar with thanks to my experience in various sectors.

However, when I was called in a few days later to sort out my documents, the manager who had previously been chatty and friendly gave off a totally different, odd vibe. Zero reaction to the jokes or small talk I was attempting to make, instead just staring me down with an unimpressed look as he went through the formalities. At that point, I don't know if I experienced a gut feeling, or just one of unease but it stuck with me.

That strange encounter prompted me to do a little bit of extra research on the exact role that I was applying for, and I wasn't exactly met with what I was hoping for. I understand every role is going to have its downsides, but what these previous employees were complaining about seemed reasonable. Plenty more responsibilities for little pay, low wages compared to other coffee chains, lack of support from managers, 10+ hour shifts being commonplace, with only a single 20 minute break per shift. Maybe I'm just lazy, but that last point stood out to me. My body already hurts very much after a typical 8-9 hour shift at my current sales job, and that's with a longer break and several instances where I'm sitting down for a few minutes at a time. 

The location of the store is really nice, I'll give it that, but on the other hand, it's about an hour away from me by bus, which means I'd have to wake up at least 3 hours before my start time to not be late, which isn't great, as the opening hours are already rather early.

Furthermore, I'd be the only female manager amidst a group of guys, and the youngest one at that. Not sure how to feel about that. 

Am I just overthinking/being lazy? Should I at least show up for my first shift and see how things go? Having managerial experience at my age sounds appealing, but would employers really care when I start applying for post graduate jobs actually in my desired field?

We talked during the meet up and It’s so cute hearing the passion in his voice when he talks about his interest.

We cuddled up and watched a show for the first half but ended up having sex. I’ve only ever bottomed twice before and I didn’t care for it but two times with him it felt like fucking heaven. I could go hours with him but that’s beside the point. 

After we cuddled again we continued watching the movie while he played with my hair. I slept over for the night. we talked more and he got me coffee for the morning. Genuinely the best time I had with a guy, the silence wasn’t awkward or anything. I haven’t done this stuff much before so maybe that’s a regular Grindr interaction and I’m being too delusional.

The problem is that he’s pretty busy with classes, he took around 5-6 so it’s hard to schedule days where he is free. He told me he was fully free during summer but sadly my school has everyone leave dorms during summer so I won’t be close in proximity.

* **What is Cyclocross?**
   * Cyclocross is a cycling sport with short races (30–45 min), lots of grass/dirt/hills, and way less serious than road racing. Think of it as cross-country running + bikes + small obstacles (sand, small barriers, etc.) It can be as competitive or non-competitive as you want to make it. All are welcome.
* **When is the cyclocross season?**
   * The local Cx scene runs late-August to late-November. There's races *most* weekends and there's no commitment to do a certain amount. Pick which ones look good, are closest to you, etc. and just show up. Pricing usually runs about $35-50/race.
* **If you're an adult rider...**
   * Check out [www.ovcx.com](http://www.ovcx.com) It’s our local league and it’s super approachable. There are beginner categories, chill vibes, and a really good group of people from all levels (not just elite racers). Most folks are there to hang out, get a workout, and drink coffee after. If you’ve ever thought about trying a race but felt intimidated — Cx is probably the most welcoming place to start.
* **If you've got kids who love to ride...**
   * Locally, the team is **Lionhearts Cycling Team** ([www.lionhearts.org](http://www.lionhearts.org)). I help coach with them, and it’s honestly one of the most positive kid sports environments I’ve been around. Super encouraging coaches, great group of families, and the kids improve crazy fast just because they’re out there having fun.
   * Ages 7-18 are welcome. The kids have practices on Tuesdays beginning mid-August. The little group practices an hour - the older kids practice for two hours. We ride bikes, play games, have snacks, and just enjoy an overall very fun and very positive environment!

Again, wanted to put together an additional informational post for the group's awareness. Im going to try and stay on top of making this a more active community with updates on local groups, rides, events, teams, etc. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions!",5,1770489688.0,cincybiking,0,1.0,False

I live in a sweet home a mile up from Montclair Village and run a little friendship group I started on meetup a while back called ‘Girls Just Wanna Complain.’ Currently have room for one last member. We are a solid seven.

We meet monthly at my home, some of us also meet up for coffee one-on-one when the mood strikes, we’ve traveled in groups of three. Those of us with hubbies  also put together pot lucks that include our husbands every few months and double date as couples.

Most of us have kids so that topic does come up, many members are New Yorkers who have lived here forever, one fun lady is English. 

I’m a music producer singer/ songwriter and mindfulness coach. Our ranks also include a money manager, a former UN ambassador / writer, a personal trainer, sculptor importer, art expert now a SF guide for fun, and an improv performer. 

I would love to add in another slightly airy fairy person like myself to the mix since most our members are very practical. You will love everyone if this is for you. 

On a personal level I’m ADHD challenged but adore common sense, ISO gfs with a positive outlook and possibly travel mates too. My hubby is not the adventurous type. lol at all. He’s a retired engineer who loves his couch and his car. 

This is random but I’m not going to edit. Look up Fearless by Lessia Bonn on YouTube if you’d like a better sense of my attitude and yes - that’s my girl Jessie Bridges singing my song. Her dad is the Dude from the Big Lebowski. I had an interesting career haha but so have all of my fun sweet ladies. Trust me, we always have so much to talk about. Musing around life rules!

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770489573.0,RepDesignersQC,1,1.0,False

Not sure how common this knowledge is in this sub. People like me experience caffeine like a real stimulant. Like a more anxious and jittery version of low dose amphetamine.

In my youth I had taken low dose 4-Fluoroamphetamine once and 3-Fluorophenmetrazine once. Both were actually calm experiences.

I drink three coffees a day and get the same body and mind euphoria every damn time. I never get used to it! I never have to up the dose or take a break.

Today I will quit cold turkey because I act like an antisocial narciccist in my relationship.
I cant tapet because when I drank one cup I crave the next until I reach the maximum pleasure exactly before it becomes a kind of panic attack.

I have zero patience and get angry all the time.
I am so sure that caffeine and my slow metabolizing are the roots of this.

I am intesely addicted to caffeine because I have replaced smoking twenty cigarettes per day with drinking caffeine and I think I need it to perform well at work. Recently I have started to take 800 mg of NAC half way through my workday to alleviate the caffeine and food crash. It somehow reliably works for me even though this effect is not documented.

I always had to consume all my caffeine before 12:00 because otherwise I would have trouble falling asleep.

On my days where I dont have to work I also have to masturbat3 before 12:00 in order to calm back down or else I could become psychotic for that day.

Caffeine makes my sleep so light that the quietest noise wakes me up.

My biggest obstacle by far is the fear that I will become the quiet and useless child I was before the age of 18 where I started to drink caffeine to become good in school (and started to secretly bite my lips to suck my own blood and enjoy the pain).

How horrific can caffeine addiction be?

I had a psychologist dismiss my concern about caffeine by saying that she drinks it herself and its not a problem. How bad can a therapist be?

Whats also interesting is that I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next week to get buproprione to combine it with dextrometorphane to extend the dxm dissociative effect duration and because it is a stimulant replace caffeine only to enhance and counteract the sedative effect of dxm. Not to be really stimulating by itself.

I hope it was an interesting read for you.

1qylnpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qylnpq/aitah_for_how_i_responded_to_my_husband_about_me/,AITAH for how i responded to my husband about me going back to work?,"**TLDR** husband is sad i want to go back to work. he said i need to work the same schedule as him when i do. that is not possible, as he works an evening blue collar job, we have a child who needs an adult at home, and i want to work a more traditional 9-5 (or around that). he said he likes working for us and taking care of me and having me at home to take care of him and my son. i essentially told him that isn't a reality i'm happy in. he told me i was condescending for how i handled the conversation and i made him feel too needy.

i'm a SAHM to a 2.5 year old. my husband works full time. he works four 10 hour shifts, then has 3 days off. i was working full time until the beginning of my pregnancy, and then my husband said he'd like for me to stay home. i was admittedly apprehensive at first, i liked working and i didn't want to be totally financially dependent on him, but he was very insistent about it, to the point of being offended i wouldn't let him take care of me. so i accepted and have been jobless for all this time.

my husband has always been made well aware by me that this is not forever. ive been happy to keep our son out of daycare while i can, im so glad that i had the opportunity to be home taking care of him his first few years. but when the time comes, i am very excited to retire from this SAHM position. some people love being a stay at home parent, i am **not** one of those people.

while i am so grateful my husband makes enough for us to stay afloat, the truth is we live paycheck to paycheck, it's very tight. being a two income household would reduce sooo much stress on both of us. we could have some fun money again. we want to buy a house.

my husband is constantly talking about how stressful/miserable it is being the sole income. he's been saying it almost every single day for years. he also has multiple expensive hobbies that we frequently cannot afford, which results in him getting very upset. aside from that mess, i desperately miss being an adult out in the world and i want to make money too. additionally, my son has multiple developmental delays and would benefit greatly from preschool.

everybody wins if i go back to work. it feels like it's time!

last summer i talked to husband about potentially enrolling our son in a free preschool offered near us (waitlist of course). i thought it would be good for him developmentally. i got him on the waitlist, thinking it would take a long time. nope, because of his delays and our income, he got accepted fast. a few days before his start date my husband sat me down, very upset, saying i had never consulted how he felt about \[son\] starting preschool and me returning to work, and he wasn't ready to ""lose us"" yet. tbh i felt guilty because it's true, i hadn't really asked him how he felt about the preschool. so i cancelled it.

about a month ago my husband playfully says ""i don't waaant you to go back to work, i like having you here while i take care of you, it makes me feel good"" to which i replied i was thankful for all he's done but i wanna take care of us too! i want us to travel and pay off debt and save up and stuff. he got pouty and said none of that is as important as ""taking care of me"".

yesterday i tried to talk to him about potentially going to school for something so i can have a ""big girl job"" someday (i've only ever worked dead-end jobs). any time i've tried to talk about going back to school, or talk about my potential career someday, he doesn't really engage in the conversation, or he'll just make negative comments about industries i suggest. my attempt at this convo went nowhere.

later that night he said when i go back to work, i need to compromise with him. he said i need to try to work the exact days and hours he does so that he doesn't miss any time with me. i paused for a moment. i mean, he works a blue collar job, late evenings, 4 days a week. someone needs to be there for \[son\], and i want to work more of a traditional 9-5 situation. he started pouting and saying i was hurting his feelings, and he wishes i would consider him more in this situation.

i said well, i'm not even job hunting right now. i have literally no idea what that will even look like when the time comes.  i told him i'd still make it a priority to have as much time together as we can, of course, but the reality is we're most likely going to have less time together. it can't really be helped, and it just a normal part of life. adults gotta work, sadly.

he sulked the rest of the night. just sat in his office sadly on his computer. told me he didn't want to talk about it anymore. he said i made him feel too needy and it wasn't fair. he also told me i was cold and condescending for saying ""it's just a normal part of life"" and said i should've expressed myself differently. i cannot think of how else i could've expressed this sentiment.

**AITAH for how i responded to him?**

(((i mean what he's saying is i would need to find a job that would only be the days he works, never his days off. so i would need to work friday-monday. oh but wait, \[son\] wouldn't have preschool on the weekends, so i can only work friday and monday. oh and also, it can't be too early in the day because i have to help husband get ready for work in the morning... like what? he was literally like ""but you make my coffee and lunch and you make me breakfast everyday, i'll be so sad without it :("". i wanted to be like ok you might have to make your own breakfast and lunch like an adult... but i didn't because i knew he'd call me condescending for that too. he also told me he's afraid i'll meet someone i like more than him. i told him he needs to have more faith in me/us.)))",3,1770489546.0,AITAH,43,0.81,False

At first I was really thrilled and grateful for the manager taking a chance on me and giving me this opportunity to progress my skills, especially after absolutely bombing my interview. All the responsibilities expected of me seemed reasonable, and there was nothing I wasn't already familiar with thanks to my experience in various sectors.

However, when I was called in a few days later to sort out my documents, the manager who had previously been chatty and friendly gave off a totally different, odd vibe. Zero reaction to the jokes or small talk I was attempting to make, instead just staring me down with an unimpressed look as he went through the formalities. At that point, I don't know if I experienced a gut feeling, or just one of unease but it stuck with me.

That strange encounter prompted me to do a little bit of extra research on the exact role that I was applying for, and I wasn't exactly met with what I was hoping for. I understand every role is going to have its downsides, but what these previous employees were complaining about seemed reasonable. Plenty more responsibilities for little pay, low wages compared to other coffee chains, lack of support from managers, 10+ hour shifts being commonplace, with only a single 20 minute break per shift. Maybe I'm just lazy, but that last point stood out to me. My body already hurts very much after a typical 8-9 hour shift at my current sales job, and that's with a longer break and several instances where I'm sitting down for a few minutes at a time. 

The location of the store is really nice, I'll give it that, but on the other hand, it's about an hour away from me by bus, which means I'd have to wake up at least 3 hours before my start time to not be late, which isn't great, as the opening hours are already rather early.

Furthermore, I'd be the only female manager amidst a group of guys, and the youngest one at that. Not sure how to feel about that. 

Am I just overthinking/being lazy? Should I at least show up for my first shift and see how things go? Having managerial experience at my age sounds appealing, but would employers really care when I start applying for post graduate jobs actually in my desired field? Is it worth it, or do I find something smaller, closer to me and focus more on university? I'd honestly feel awful for backing out out of the blue and inconveniencing the manager and everyone else, but I'm really on the fence here. ",1,1770489496.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

**MEMORY TRANSCRIPT | BRIGAM IRONS**

**Date:** Anno Domini 2263, July 28

**Location:** Hyperspace Transit to Caelum-Va

Elara floated up the elevator to the bridge. Our pet Captain had finally woken up after about fourteen hours of sleep.

*Fourteen hours.*

If anyone under my command slept that long, I’d assume he was in a coma. The rest of her crew hadn't even woken up yet. If it was just yesterday, I could’ve put it under the tab of trauma. But now? It was just biology. They were soft.

""Ah, Elara,"" I said, spinning my chair around. ""I’d hoped I’d get to stare into the white void for a few more minutes before I had to share it. Something on your mind?""

""Good morning, lord admiral."" Elara found her seat beside me.

I am incompetent at reading organic emotions, too many micro-expressions. But even I could tell something heavy weighed down on her mind. And her ears. They were pressed flat against her skull.

""Lord Admiral,"" she repeated. ""I have a request to make.""

""Oh?""

Our guest was a bit bolder than she looked.

""Since you came to me rather than Bradley I assume it's not a comfort issue. What’d be so important you'd come to interrupt my doing absolutely nothing for?""

""Lord Admiral, you have a very... *particular* sense of humor.""

""Ah, you don't like my jokes? ""

""It's not about your jokes, lord Admiral. I would have stayed out of the bridge if it was the jokes.""

""What was that?""

""Nothing.""

What previously weighed on her mind manifested itself into the air which surrounds her. It's turned stormy with worry. She took a deep breath, a real deep breath, and steeled herself.

""Lord Admiral Irons, I would like to request for your assistance in the defense of Caelum-Va.""

""Done.""

""I knew you would be hesit--wait. What?""

I stood up from the chair and turned to the navy blue light of the star chart. So vast was she, our milky way, yet so much unknown hidden behind the fog.

""This sector is far too close to the borders of Humanity to be overrun by mutant shrimp,"" I exhaled, tapping the glass of the projector. ""It is also useful to be owed a favor.""

*Well, there was another reason.* But I’d keep that to myself for now. 

Elara scurried over to the starboard console and zoomed in on the Caelum-Va system. ""Uh, um, well... yes. The defense of the system. We should discuss the tactical disposition.""

She tried to bring up the details of the system. However, the Mandate sensors displayed nothing but the star, a gas giant, and a blurry outline marked *'STRUCTURAL ANOMALY - UNCHARTED.'*

""Oh, it's uncharted."" She whispered with obvious disappointment.

""Of course it's uncharted, we can't exactly look at it with a nebula in the way.” I scoffed, “What were you going to show me?""

“Lord Admiral, we will arrive in the system soon. It would have been useful to show you the fleet formation so you could join it easily. No matter, I have the information about the forces likely present.”

Elara put a finger under her tongue, fiddled a bit, and pulled out a small tablet. She pressed it against the holotable. A small *click* resonated, and alien telemetry projected onto the Mandate map. The translator drone parsed it into English instantly.

I looked at the tonnage and the armaments present.

Three dozen Corvettes. Five Destroyers.

""It looks adequate for a patrol screen,"" I muttered, sipping the air. ""Perhaps not enough for a strike fleet defense, but who knows? Maybe your railguns are better than ours.""

""Where is the Capital Fleet?""

Elara froze. Her eyes stayed on the map, but her ears drooped low.

""The five 'Destroyers'..."" she said softly. ""Those are the Concordat Flagships. The 'Corvettes' are the Sector Cruiser Fleet.""

She locked eyes with me.

""This is all that we have on the Southern Front.""

I stared at the map, then hit the coffee button. The machine buzzed to life and spat out a vat of the choking sludge. I took a sip.

""The Korock fleet I blew up a couple of days ago... each and every one of those ships matched these 'Flagships' of yours,"" I said flatly. I took another sip. ""They were comfortable enough to send *four of them* as a raiding force.""

""They broke through the lines,"" Elara admitted, her voice trembling. ""Much of the Southern Fleet is shattered. I was redirected from the East. The front there is collapsing, just slower."" She grabbed my hand. It felt soft. Warm. ""Lord Admiral, can I trust you to stand with us?""

I downed the coffee in one go.

“I already said I would.”

The fleet which would be headed for Caelum-Va would be the one on the chase from previous engagements with their south, she had previous intel. 

If the Korock maintained their momentum, the incoming strike force would be at least two Heavy Cruisers, eight Light Cruisers, and ten Destroyers.

The Concordat alone stands no chance against them, they have no capital ships to trade blows with them, no frigates to ambush with, and simply not enough ships to wear them down. They do not stand alone, however.

The Manifest destiny, by sheer tonnage and firepower would make for just the perfect capital of this fleet of screens. Hopefully.

The elevator hummed again, bringing the rest of the Elven command staff, sharp in their uniforms but smelling of fear. For a while, the command room buzzed with the discussion of tactics. The air felt alive for the first time in fifteen years.

Just in time for this ship to exit warp.

CRACK.

We spat out of hyperspace in minutes, it was a smooth ride without momentum, as it always was. 

It was Caelum-Va, the main sequence star, a few scattered planets, and a gas giant with a lush green moon.

And as expected, we came face to face with a fleet of terrified screens.

And as expected, they fired.

*THUD. THUD. THUD.*

The knocking on the hull of the *Manifest Destiny* felt like drizzles of rain on a tin roof. I could feel the faint vibrations through the deck plates, the faint heartbeat of the armor. 

Elara and her subordinates were right there with me, what they were unnerved by is not the suddenness of the friendly fire, rather, the calmness of it.

""Is this what the Korock command feels when they come against us?"" a Lieutenant whispered, staring at the shield diagnostics which hadn't even dropped by 1%.

""It’s so quiet… are the guns of the Concordat that inadequate?"" a Sub-Commander added, horrified.

""Ladies! Don’t feel too bad."" Warmth rushed over me knowing the old girl still stood up. I turned to them. ""After all, this is two hundred million tonnes of pure American engineering.""

“Admiral Irons, if I may, it would be a wise decision to hail the ‘Concordat’ now.” Johnson finally added in. 

“Ah, yes.”

I opened the main frequency using the codes Elara provided.

 The raindrops of the concordat shelling continued for another ten minutes or so of futile panic before settling as they finally realized we weren’t shooting back. The main screen flickered. Hail received.

There, on the other side, was a lemur with six arms wearing a high-G circus suit.

“What the hell?” I muttered.

Damn. Looks like not all of them are the cute ones.

""Are you here to taunt us, horrid abomination?"" the Lemur chattered, its voice high and percussive. ""Wait. No. You are not Korock."" The Lemur blinked its very large eyes. ""What? Did the Aevari finally find their long-lost male counterparts? ""

“What? Elara, come and talk to the spider-monkey,” I stepped aside, “isn’t this supposed to be one of *your* sector capitals?”

“Spider-monkey? Why, I see your other half is quite foul mouthed!”

""Admiral Vee-Rok-La!"" Elara stepped into the frame, bowing. ""It is good to see you.""

“Captain Elara! We received a distress signal from the transport, command thought you lost to the void!”

“And I would have been, if not for Lord Admiral Irons.”

The creature looked at me from across the screen. I waved at it lazily. It folded its six hands together into a complex knot. I think that was an apology. Or something. I couldn't tell.

*Wait a minute, the other half? Are elves all female or something?*

""The Aevari Council had been grief-stricken at the thought of sending one hundred of their best daughters to their deaths,"" Vee-Rok-La clicked. ""But you have come back not only intact, but with a Super-Dreadnought as well!""

“There were twenty-eight of us who didn’t make it.” Elara announced sternly.

I suppose that was necessary information to disclose, but it sure killed the mood quick. 

Still... come on. A six-armed lemur? My annoyance was visible on my face. What else is there? Jellyfish? Bugs that they decided they liked? A sentient fungus, perhaps. I kicked back in the command chair while Elara and the Thing discussed the specifics of integrating the *Manifest Destiny* into the formation, the datalinks, firing solutions, IFF tags, such and such.

Johnson hailed me through the link:  
\[Admiral Irons\]

\[Go ahead, Johnson\]

\[Did you think all the species which the language groups belonged to would be made in the Imago Dei?\]

\[Well, yes. I’d come with the hope I’d be meeting, you know.\]

\[Why, more cute alien broads to be indebted to you?\]

\[...\]

\[I’m sorry admiral, I can’t put a filter on my mouth if these are my thoughts.\]

\[You are excused.\]

\[Should we turn back?\]

\[What? No! We’d be leaving the ‘Aelvari’ to be blown apart.\]

\[Or we could be getting ourselves blown apart because you wanted to play Knight in Shining Armor for the ones with the cute face and soft voice.\]

\[Johnson.\]

\[God, admiral, I’m so sorry.\]

\[You are excused. Get back to work.\]

Elara finished her conversation, her face bright with the prospect of a defense which would once have the odds balanced. It was evident on her ears as too, they perked up, twitching with hope.

""Helm,"" I ordered. ""Take us in.""

I sailed into the not-so-crowded sealane of the Concordat. For the second time this week, the railguns powered up in the face of an opponent none of us had met before.

""Marines to the lee-side hangars. Prepare for Boarding Actions.""

I heard the hut hut of the marines once again. 

I feel the tension in the air as the wait settles in.

I am alive again.

My wife and I aren’t big drinkers or the most social people so we tend to prefer a more laid back vibe (I know that’s not what Carnival is, but they had the best itinerary by far and that’s what’s more important to us. 

We booked an interior room, but it’s at the front of the ship under the bridge with a window overlooking the walkway. I heard the front walkways aren’t ever crowded so it’s almost like having your own balcony that doesn’t connect with the room. 

I’ve been debating if it might be worth paying $900 more to get a cove balcony on deck 2. My thoughts are it would give us a place to sit outside away from a lot of the noise and a cove balcony would give more shade than a regular balcony. 

I like the thought of being able to sit out on the balcony to have our morning coffee, or have breakfast brought to our room. But how hot do the balconies get?  I figure they are probably too hot in the afternoon, but are they tolerable in the morning ing and evening?

Things have been amazing and throughout our relationship i have never doubted that I can trust him. He is amazing and we rarely fight and are very honest with each other. I have never been suspicious or had any reason to be.

Yesterday we had a small fight and didn’t speak for a few hours. We reconciled this morning and things were good. We went for a coffee and hung out. When we were hanging out, i was on his phone and saw in his search history that he had been watching porn on twitter.

Upon finding this i was a bit taken aback, but what hurt the most was seeing him search for specific things such as “petite blonde”. I do not resemble this at all.

I felt sick to my stomach and immediately left with no explanation. My boyfriend was not aware why i left or why i was annoyed. Later on after dodging numerous phone calls i told him why I left and he apologised. I told him that sorry does not cut it and i am currently not sure how to proceed.

I am not only upset that he was searching specifically for women who don’t resemble me at all, suggesting that i am not his type whatsoever, but also that he was doing this when we were on bad terms. I feel like if we were to stay together i would doubt myself about how attracted he is to me and if he was being lustful towards other women (petite blonde ones for example) without me knowing. I feel like i would just be too insecure. I think it has broken a lot of trust.

Coming from a previous relationship with constant cheating i am not willing to put myself into that toxic cycle again as it completely destroyed my self esteem.

\- They were founded in 1978. Elder wisdom still steeps in the walls of this establishment. You don’t leave with an aftertaste of ignorance upon departure. You sip your coffee and reflect how you can be a better steward of all things life.

\-They have mugs and offer a discount for a stay and sip. Choosing this option, you don’t collude in the unnecessary murder of a tree.

\-They are pro community, and the proof is festooned on the walls. Instead of a mirror in the bathroom, there’s a collage of goofiness, demonstrative of the culture crafted throughout the years.

\-number 1 on Google didn’t even have a mug option. They need to be dethroned. You only like this place because it’s trendy. Get over that trendiness, girlfriend. Extend a hand to nature. The toxicity in your life will retreat, as you’re no longer colluding in the tsunamis of your life.

\-Bernice sounds like a good grandma name. You know grandma does it best. Grandma doesn’t rob you. She dishes out excellence with a smile. The lovely ladies here seem to be grandmas in training. They dish out smiles and deliciousness and dress fabulously. When you get your bill, you think, “my goodness! You must of missed something.” 

Their reply: “no, honey, we won’t you to have enough money for lunch.”

\-Lastly, Bernice’s is considerate through and through. They’re here for me and they’re here for you. They won’t shove anything down your throat here, but you’ll consider doing so on your own volition. People read the newspaper here and hold hands, and the sunshine pours in perfectly. You don’t want to go anywhere else. If you do, you’ll certainly miss out on being number 1. To be number 1, you have to start with choosing peeps who make eats and drinks with love. Drink love then you can be love and breath love. Go get you a cup of sunshine at Bernice’s. Notice these noticings, and you’ll never return to the dark side.

It started ever since i was 14, after My immunity was thrown upside down for when i caught a norovirus and was therefore hospitalized for 2 weeks. 

So, i started this year with my symptoms being a lot worse than ever before. More fissures, possibly chronic. I have to limp everywhere due to the pain so my doctor recommends another surgery. Never knew the cause of it, my dad is lactose intolerant and also has stomach issues, so i didnt care about labels and just went with that. Well, after taking a lot of tests, my doctors came to the conclusion that Crohn’s disease fits my picture. So i have some more tests to do, so i can get a colonoscopy. Ive been simply declining for being 6 months away from being 18. So my doctor collects all the tests in hopes of My colonoscopy being accepted. 

Well its either crohns, a tumor or colitis. 

So my options arent the nicest, id say

The pain is gradually getting worse and im not being helped with it. I work out, eat healthy, stopped drinking milk and coffee but its not helping my case.  Im not getting any medication, its all the same treatment. “Take a warm bath every evening” “apply this cream” “drink this”

Im honestly getting sick of all the doctors appointments, i have to get pulled out of class every week and im starting to miss so many important lectures. So i hope my colonoscopy paints a clear picture, i get treatment and get better? Possibly?

那时候警察还在大规模拘捕同性恋，所以安吉洛和比尔并不敢公开相爱，他们在离纽约几小时车程之外的火岛租了一间房子，周末的时候就一起跑去火岛生活。

很快，火岛成为了安吉洛和比尔的家。当时很多男同性恋为了躲避拘捕，都慢慢搬来了火岛。那时候同性恋还没有条件公开主张自己的基本权利，只能非常低调的生活。石墙起义是十多年之后的事情，“同性恋渐渐得以公开生活的70年代”是二十年之后的事情。

随着时间的推移，安吉洛和比尔帮助了很多男同性恋在火岛上立足。在火岛上，这些男同性恋终于有机会公开讲述、分享、并讨论自己的生活。很多人会回忆起当年精心打扮去当时纽约著名的同性恋酒吧“晚安俱乐部”聆听芭芭拉·史翠珊的现场演唱的事情，而当年著名歌星芭芭拉·史翠珊也还只有二十几岁。

在同性婚姻合法之前，比尔就因为癌症去世了，所以安吉洛没能和比尔结婚，但安吉洛和比尔相伴了一生，直至比尔去世。老了之后，他们冬天生活在曼哈顿岛，夏天就去火岛生活。

I started a on-campus job at the physical center this week. My friend helped me get it, telling me it would be easy because it's on-campus, and I could study or use my phone when things were slow. But yesterday, I ended up crying in the cafeteria because of this job. I never thought it would be so hard that I wouldn't even have time to drink coffee. I didn't get to eat lunch until almost 2 pm.

Being a girl, I had to carry so much heavy weight. One time, I almost tripped and fell because the rod I was carrying was twice my height and weight. I just rested for about 20 minutes. this has happened twice this week already. My day was already off to a bad start because I missed my bus and had to wait 45 minutes in the snow.

The thing is, yesterday wasn't even my shift at that place. I was supposed to be at the counter, thinking I'd just sit there and do my assignments. But I still had to go and carry that heavy weight. The guy whose job was there just stood there eating while I was struggling. After that, I finally got off work around 2 pm and went to have lunch. My hands were shaking so much from the weight, and I felt so bad. It felt unfair because yesterday wasn't my scheduled shift there, but I tried to push through, thinking maybe it's just the first week and they're being tough. Yet, I've seen other new students just sitting at the counter during their shifts, and I wondered, ""Why me?""

1qylbtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1qylbtc/finally_dialed_in_with_wdt_and_puck_screen/,Finally Dialed in with WDT and Puck Screen,"I’ve had this machine for a few weeks now. Like many I’ve had big challenges getting a consistently rich espresso shot. I read advice in this sub, tweaked the grind setting above or below machine recommendations, tried reduced tamp pressure, tweaked shot heat and strength, but despite these steps I would still experience channeling on many of my shots. Usually the shot would start nice and slow but then halfway through it would accelerate significantly and ruin the taste. It was frustrating.

After all that I decided to try getting a WDT tool and a puck screen. This turned out to be a great move. I’m now experiencing consistently great shots. 

I went for a thick puck screen at 1.7mm. The thinking is that a thicker screen will not just keep the machine clean but will slow and distribute the flow of water better, which this machine desperately needs.

I have a Pro with a built-in tamper. What I do is grind my beans, do a very light tamp just to press the grinds into the basket, pull the basket out, mix the grinds with the WDT tool starting with a twist motion repeated around the perimeter, then a few swirls of the tool, then a couple of taps of the basket on the counter to settle the grind, then reinsert the basket and do a very firm tamp with the tamp handle.

Then I drop my puck screen on top and pull my shot. My grind setting is set to the machine recommendation (15) and shot time is about 30 seconds for a double. I’m using fresh medium dark to dark beans from a local high end roaster. 

If I do see channeling start at the tail end of the shot (this only happened once, when I probably didn’t stir the grind well enough), I just press the shot button to stop it early which mostly saves the shot. 

It’s a few extra steps that I didn’t anticipate when I bought the machine, but I have it down pat and am getting great results. Here are the products I’m using:

Normcore 53.3mm Puck Screen - Lower Shower Screen - Metal Contact Screen for Espresso 54mm Portafilter Filter Basket - 1.7mm Thickness 150μm - 316 Stainless Steel https://a.co/d/0aClFAfl

Limited-time deal: WDT Espresso Distribution Tool Espresso Stirrer Tools for Barista, 0.35mm 7 Needles Espresso Coffee Stirrer with Extra 7 Replaceable Needles, Aluminum Alloy Handle with Stand (Black) https://a.co/d/08f2zX0D

I hope this helps people struggling with this machine. It’s a well built and well designed machine for the most part. But it lacks the finer level of shot pressure control that is needed to prevent channeling. These additional steps seem to mitigate that. ",3,1770488809.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,1,1.0,False

1qylanv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1qylanv/the_psychology_of_disgustingly_articulate_speech/,The Psychology of Disgustingly Articulate Speech: What Actually Works,"I spent years sounding like a mumbling idiot in every meeting, date, and family gathering. My thoughts were clear in my head but came out as verbal diarrhea. I'd watch confident speakers command a room while I struggled to order coffee without stumbling. Then I went down a rabbit hole of communication research, neuroscience podcasts, and speech coaching content. Turns out most advice about ""speaking clearly"" is surface level BS that ignores how our brains actually process and produce language.

The real issue isn't that you're inarticulate. It's that nobody taught you how verbal communication actually works. We're expected to magically know how to structure thoughts, control our vocal apparatus, and manage cognitive load simultaneously. Society romanticizes ""natural speakers"" while the rest of us feel defective. But here's what changed everything for me: articulate speech is a skill you build through specific techniques, not some genetic lottery you either win or lose.

Slow down your speaking rate by 20%. Sounds stupidly simple but this alone will transform your clarity. Most people speak too fast because anxiety floods their system with cortisol, which speeds up everything. [Dr. Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) talks about this on his podcast, he's a neuroscientist at Stanford who breaks down how stress hormones literally accelerate your speech patterns before your brain can keep up. When you deliberately slow down, you give your prefrontal cortex time to select better words and your articulatory muscles time to hit proper positions. Record yourself speaking at your normal pace, then record again at 80% speed. The difference is shocking. You'll notice fewer filler words, clearer consonants, and better thought organization. Practice this during low stakes conversations first, like chatting with a barista or leaving voice messages.

Read aloud for 10 minutes daily. This builds the neural pathways between reading comprehension and speech production. Pick anything, news articles, reddit posts, whatever. The goal is training your mouth to match the pace of organized written thoughts. Lawyer and communication coach Vinh Giang (he has a massive YouTube channel) recommends this technique because it forces you to see punctuation, which teaches natural pausing. Most inarticulate speech comes from run on sentences where everything blurs together. When you read aloud, you're literally practicing the rhythm of clear communication. Your brain starts recognizing sentence structure patterns and your default speech becomes more organized. I do this with random Wikipedia articles every morning while making coffee.

Master the pause. Articulate speakers aren't afraid of silence. They use pauses like punctuation marks. Watch any Barack Obama speech, the dude pauses constantly and it makes him sound 10x more thoughtful and clear. Pausing gives you processing time and gives listeners absorption time. It feels awkward at first because we're conditioned to fill every gap, but strategic pauses make you sound confident and intentional rather than frantic. Try this: before answering any question, pause for literally two seconds. Count it in your head. Then speak. That micro delay lets you organize thoughts instead of verbal vomiting the first words that come to mind.

Download Audible or get a library card for audiobooks. Listen to well spoken narrators at 1x speed (not 1.5x, normal speed). Your brain unconsciously mimics speech patterns you're exposed to. If you spend hours daily listening to articulate speakers, your default vocabulary and sentence structure will level up through passive absorption. [Never Split the Difference](https://www.chrisboss.com/) by Chris Voss is insanely good for this. Voss is a former FBI hostage negotiator and the audiobook is narrated perfectly. You'll absorb his deliberate pacing, strategic pausing, and clear pronunciation while learning negotiation tactics.

Practice the ""billboard technique"" for organizing thoughts. Before speaking on any topic, imagine you have to fit your main point on a billboard that drivers see for 3 seconds. What's the core message? Lead with that, then add supporting details. Most rambling happens because people don't know their main point, so they speak hoping to discover it mid sentence. This technique comes from strategic communication research, basically how PR firms train spokespeople. Decide your endpoint before starting your journey. In conversations this looks like taking that 2 second pause to identify your billboard message, then speaking it clearly, then elaborating if needed.

Film yourself speaking for 60 seconds about any random topic. Do this weekly. You'll hate watching it back but it's the fastest way to identify your verbal tics. Maybe you say ""like"" 47 times per minute. Maybe you mumble word endings. Maybe your face barely moves when you talk, which affects clarity because articulation requires actual mouth movement. Seeing yourself objectively shows exactly what needs fixing. I learned I barely opened my mouth when speaking, which made everything sound muffled. Once I started exaggerating mouth movements (feels weird, looks normal), clarity jumped dramatically.

Read [The Articulate Executive](https://www.granvilletoogood.com/) by Granville Toogood. This book is a masterclass in business communication but applies to all speaking contexts. Toogood spent decades coaching Fortune 500 executives and politicians on verbal presence. He breaks down the specific mechanics of clear speech, proper breathing techniques, vocal projection, strategic word choice. The book has practical drills you can do alone that target specific articulation weaknesses. One chapter focuses entirely on eliminating filler words through awareness exercises. Another covers how to structure impromptu responses so you never sound caught off guard. It's dense with actionable techniques rather than motivational fluff.

Practice belly breathing before important conversations. Shallow chest breathing creates vocal tension and reduces oxygen to your brain, making word retrieval harder. Deep diaphragmatic breathing relaxes your vocal cords and increases cognitive function. Before meetings or dates or any speaking situation, do 5 deep belly breaths. Inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 6. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts that fight or flight response that makes you speak too fast and stumble over words.

Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals.

You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or other sessions without feeling like work.

The transformation isn't instant. I still sometimes sound like an idiot when I'm tired or anxious. But now I have tools to course correct mid conversation instead of spiraling into verbal chaos. Clear articulate speech is just pattern recognition and muscle memory, same as learning an instrument or sport. Your brain is ridiculously adaptable, it will build these pathways if you consistently practice. Six months from now you'll be that person who people actually listen to when you speak.",1,1770488737.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks
Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie
Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie
Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie
Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants
Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants
Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low
Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater
Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770488688.0,JoyabuyOfficial,1,1.0,False

We usually put 75 grams per 1.25L (so full carafe). First time, the coffee was a bit too sour, so we decided to grind a little bit finer. It was just one click to the left on the Ode Gen 2, so we didn't go way too fine I would say. The second time we brewed coffee (75 gr/1.25L) with the finer grounds, the Moccamaster overflowed, causing a mess. What are your tips on this? Do I need a better coffee filter? We currently have brown cheap ones from the supermarket. Do we need to stir to avoid this? Do we need to add the water in two parts? ",2,1770488665.0,Moccamaster,6,1.0,False

However, this morning I tried to make a coffee (regular double espresso). As soon as I turned it on it didn't make the regular sound and it wasn't able to pour the coffee as after 3-4 seconds, the brewing stopped. 

Afterwards I de-scaled the machine and did a deep clean with the tablet in the portafilter. Neither of them fixed the problem. I went to the server menu and saw 2 errors. First, ER14 flowmeter count (Operation) and 99 Communication Errors. I think the ER14 is causing the issue but no idea how to resolve this.
