 ## Key Features Analysis

The Semi circle sofa boasts several distinctive features that set it apart from traditional sofa designs.

**Curved Design:** The most defining characteristic of a semi circle sofa is its curved shape. This design promotes a more intimate and conversational seating arrangement, encouraging interaction among guests. The gentle curve also softens the overall look of a room, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication.

**Modular Options:** Many modern semi circle sofas come in modular sections, allowing for customization and flexibility. These sections can be arranged in various configurations to fit different room sizes and layouts. This modularity also makes it easier to move and transport the sofa, as it can be disassembled into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Upholstery Variety:** Semi circle sofas are available in a wide array of upholstery options, including luxurious velvet, durable leather, and comfortable fabric blends. The choice of upholstery can significantly impact the overall look and feel of the sofa, as well as its maintenance requirements. Consider your lifestyle and aesthetic preferences when selecting the upholstery material.

**Frame Construction:** The quality of the frame is crucial for the longevity and stability of a semi circle sofa. Look for sofas with frames made from solid hardwood, such as kiln-dried oak or maple. These materials provide superior strength and resistance to warping, ensuring that your sofa will maintain its shape and structural integrity for years to come.

**Cushion Filling:** The comfort of a semi circle sofa is heavily influenced by the type of cushion filling used. Options include high-density foam, feather-down blends, and fiberfill. High-density foam provides firm support and retains its shape well, while feather-down blends offer a plush and luxurious feel. Fiberfill is a more affordable option that provides good comfort and support.

**Size and Dimensions:** Semi circle sofas come in various sizes, ranging from smaller loveseat-style curves to large, expansive designs that can accommodate multiple people. It's essential to measure your space carefully and consider the overall flow of the room before selecting a sofa size. Ensure that there is enough clearance around the sofa for comfortable movement and access.

 ## Core Benefits

Semi circle sofas offer a range of practical and aesthetic benefits that enhance the living space.

**Enhanced Social Interaction:** The curved design naturally fosters conversation and interaction among people seated on the sofa. Unlike traditional linear sofas that can create a sense of separation, a semi circle sofa encourages face-to-face communication and creates a more inclusive atmosphere. This makes it ideal for social gatherings and family time.

**Space Optimization:** While they may seem large, semi circle sofas can actually optimize space in certain room layouts. Their curved shape can soften harsh corners and create a more fluid and organic flow within the room. This is especially beneficial in open-concept spaces where defining distinct areas is important.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** A semi circle sofa is a statement piece that adds a touch of sophistication and elegance to any room. Its distinctive shape instantly elevates the overall aesthetic and creates a focal point that draws the eye. This makes it a great choice for those who want to create a stylish and memorable living space.

**Versatile Styling Options:** Semi circle sofas can be styled in a variety of ways to match different décor themes. They can be paired with throw pillows, blankets, and rugs to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. They can also be accessorized with coffee tables, side tables, and lighting fixtures to complete the look.

**Increased Seating Capacity:** Depending on the size, a semi circle sofa can comfortably seat multiple people, making it a practical choice for larger families or those who frequently entertain guests. This eliminates the need for additional chairs or seating arrangements, creating a more cohesive and streamlined look.

 ## FAQs Section

**Are semi circle sofas suitable for small spaces?**
  While semi circle sofas are generally larger than traditional sofas, smaller models are available that can work in smaller spaces. Consider a loveseat-style semi circle sofa or a modular design that can be configured to fit your space. It's also important to choose a lighter color and a lower profile to prevent the sofa from overwhelming the room.

**How do I clean and maintain a semi circle sofa?**
  The cleaning and maintenance requirements for a semi circle sofa depend on the upholstery material. Velvet sofas require professional cleaning to prevent damage to the delicate fibers. Leather sofas can be cleaned with a damp cloth and leather conditioner. Fabric sofas can be spot-cleaned with a mild detergent and water. Regular vacuuming is also recommended to remove dust and debris.

**Can I customize the size and shape of a semi circle sofa?**
  Many manufacturers offer customization options for semi circle sofas, allowing you to choose the size, shape, and upholstery material that best suits your needs. Modular designs are particularly versatile, as they can be configured in various ways to create different shapes and sizes. Contact a reputable furniture retailer or manufacturer to discuss your customization options.

**What type of décor styles work best with semi circle sofas?**
  Semi circle sofas can complement a variety of décor styles, including modern, contemporary, art deco, and bohemian. They work particularly well in spaces with curved architectural elements or a focus on organic shapes. Consider the color, texture, and style of the sofa when selecting accessories and other furniture pieces to create a cohesive and harmonious look.

Back in 2022, I was required to get covid vaccination for my work, by that point I have 2 covid jab already in 2021, both were Moderna, did not have any long lasting side effects. However, when I was about to receive my 3rd jab, the nurse said Moderna is prone to give male under 30 heart issues so she said she'll switch it over to pfizer for my 3rd one. I said that's fine, overall she's a Healthcare professional and I'm not.

Fast forward to an hour after the jab, heart started to ache, feeling like getting stabbed every time when it contract and expand, thought it was just temporary side effects, tried to sleep it off. Next morning, pain is still there and getting worse, trying to tough it out. Evening rolls around, not getting any better and can't fell asleep due to the pain, went to the ER, they did an EKG and blood work on me, everything came back as normal. They prescribed me some 500mg naproxen and sent me my way, those did help. Due to busy and unstable work scheduled, I wasn't able to take those naproxen on the regular. One morning, woke up, heart rate raised to 140, feel like an elephant sitting on my chest, can't breathe, feeling numb, feeling light headed and dizzy. Heart rate did not go down at all till an hour or two later. Went to a hospital, got told the same thing, there's nothing wrong with me. Fast forward to a month or two later, heart no longer ache for every heartbeat it only comes back after coffee and exercise, occasionally it ache for no reason.  Fast forward to 2025, the ache still linger with me, maybe I'm numb to it but I hardly notice it, it only comes back when I'm doing anything intense or long endurance. My job is very physically demanding and Im unable to progress in my career till this is sorted out. Doctors and cardiologist in my area are extremely limited and the wait list is extremely long.Any help is appreciated and thanks for reading.

1kgqd5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialistGaming/comments/1kgqd5i/belonging_outside_belonging/,Belonging Outside Belonging > ???,"Hey guys, I want to run *Dream Apart/Dream Askew* with a different game system.

**BEFORE YOU YELL** I like BOB, but I am interested in exploring science fiction themes. I am interested in a conversation here about these topics and gaming rather than like a specific answer. It's the *discussion* that is most useful to me: what things you'd want, what things you would not.

First, about me: I am a linguist and a scholar of Judaism (and a Jew). I am trans and a butch-ish lesbian. I like horror and science fiction. I love coffee and desert climates.

Aside from these considerations of setting influences, I want to highlight LGBTQIA+, socialism v empire, solarpunk, and cyberpunk, Judaism (scifi/future Judaism included).

The Imperial Russian annexation of the Rzeczpospolita and their subsequent drafting of male Jews over 12 into the army is an exciting moment of tension (for a setting); it's part of the background of *Dream Apart*, as one of the playbooks is the returned and alienated soldier, who may bring back PTSD, physical disability, a dangerous weapon, and/or Bundist, Zionist, and/or socialist ideas, and who has been essentially cloistered with other Jews since age 12 with no further religious learning nor religious practice.

Games that inspire me when I think about the game I want to write/play/think about:

* [Society of Rafa](https://societyofrafa.com/product/society-of-rafa-rafa-bag/)
* Savage Union
* [Free from the Yoke](https://ufopress.co.uk/free-from-the-yoke/) (Worlds of Legacy)
* Thirsty Sword Lesbians
* [Rust and Redemption](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/rust-and-redemption/) (Cypher System)
* [Misspent Youth](https://www.fraggingunicorns.com/shop/p/misspent-youth-core-rulebook) (and its followup, *Sell Out With Me*)
* Human Contact by Joshua A. C. Newman (couldn't find a working link?)
* [Orbital Blues](https://usa.soulmuppet-store.co.uk/collections/orbital-blues)

You might notice I'm torn primarily about the balance between a little crunch and dystopia and a little adventuring against a kind of cozy-esque setting, as well as how to integrate sort of historical settings where Jews were restricted in jobs and locations with things like cybernetics, mecha, and some degree of adventuring.

The worlds of DA/DA are not specifically cozy but there's a sense that the characters are trying to make some coziness work within an unpleasant and often hostile world, and there's a tension between this and the fact that the outside is not actually *entirely* evil nor can the communities actually survive in isolation. The shtetls of Dream Apart include Jewish *and* Catholic Polish members, and both are faced with Imperial and Orthodox rule.

Anyway, this is kind of a meandering post but I just hope someone might have something interesting to say.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever considered living in a barndominium? These unique homes mix the charm of a barn with the comfort of modern living. One of the popular sizes for these houses is the 40x50 layout. This design offers plenty of room for a family while keeping the charming rustic aesthetic that barndominiums are known for. Let’s dive into designing your dream 40x50 barndominium and explore some enticing floor plans!

Choosing the right floor plan is essential in creating a comfortable living space. A 40x50 barndominium provides a versatile space for various designs. Here are a few popular configurations:

- **Open Concept Living:** Emphasizing spaciousness, this layout merges the kitchen, dining area, and living room into one large space. This design encourages family interaction and is perfect for entertaining guests.
- **Split Bedroom Layout:** This design separates the master suite from additional bedrooms. This layout offers privacy for parents while keeping access to the kids’ rooms easily manageable.
- **Dedicated Office Space:** With more people working from home, incorporating an office area into your floor plan allows for productivity while maintaining family life.
- **Two-Story Design:** For those wanting additional space, a two-story barndominium can provide more rooms or a loft area. This design can create stunning visual appeal!

When designing your 40x50 barndominium, several factors will help you make the most of your space:

- **Natural Light:** Maximizing windows can enhance the energy and feel of your home. Consider larger windows in common areas to create bright, inviting spaces.
- **Flex Spaces:** Rooms that serve multiple purposes can adapt to changing needs. A guest room can double as a play area or office when there are no guests.
- **Storage Solutions:** clever storage helps keep the space tidy. Look for nooks and crannies, under-stair storage, or even built-in cabinets.

Of course, including your personal touch is vital in a barndominium. Whether you prefer rustic finishes or modern accents, your individual style should shine through. Here are some design elements you might want to consider:

- **Rustic Wood Features:** Exposed beams, wood paneling, and hardwood floors provide warmth and character that matches the barn aesthetic.
- **Metal Accents:** Galvanized metal can create contrast against wood elements. Consider using it for light fixtures, railings, or even as wall decor.
- **Subway Tile and Open Shelving:** In the kitchen, subway tiles can give a timeless look, while open shelving allows for displaying your favorite dishes and decor.

Another important aspect of your 40x50 barndominium is outdoor space. A well-planned deck or patio can extend your living area. Think about the following options when designing your outdoor space:

- **Rooftop Deck:** If you go for a two-story design, a rooftop deck can provide amazing views while serving as a perfect entertainment spot.
- **Porches:** A front or back porch can be a cozy nook to enjoy your morning coffee or evening relaxation time.
- **Landscaping:** Incorporate natural features with shrubs, flowers, or even vegetable gardens to enhance the beauty and functionality of your outdoor area.

Remember to keep your budget in mind while planning your 40x50 barndominium. Create a realistic budget that includes construction costs, materials, and future maintenance. By prioritizing your needs and preferences, you can design a barndominium you will love for years to come.

A 40x50 barndominium provides a remarkable opportunity to blend charm with modern convenience. With careful planning and consideration of functional elements, you can create a space that not only feels like home but also showcases your unique style. Happy designing!

Sustainable Living: Benefits of Choosing a Barndominium for Modern Life
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, sustainable living is becoming increasingly important. Many people are seeking ways to reduce their environmental impact while still enjoying a comfortable and stylish lifestyle. One of the most innovative solutions is the barndominium—a versatile structure that combines traditional barn elements with modern living accommodations. This unique concept not only provides a cozy home but also aligns perfectly with sustainable living principles.

### Energy Efficiency

Barndominiums are specifically designed to be energy-efficient. Their open floor plans create ample airflow and natural lighting, reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling. Key features that enhance energy efficiency include:

- **Insulation:** Many barndominiums use high-quality insulation to maintain a consistent indoor temperature.
- **LED Lighting:** Installing energy-efficient LEDs can result in significant savings on electric bills.
- **Renewable Energy Sources:** Many owners incorporate solar panels or wind turbines to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy.

### Use of Sustainable Materials

Building a barndominium often involves using sustainable materials, such as reclaimed wood or metal. These materials not only add character but also lower the environmental footprint of the construction process. By choosing materials that are sourced responsibly, you contribute to the conservation of natural resources. Some favorite choices for a barndominium include:

- **Recycled Steel:** Durable and low-maintenance, steel is an eco-friendly choice for roofing and structural elements.
- **Reclaimed Wood:** Utilizing wood from old barns or houses gives new life to materials and reduces waste.
- **Eco-friendly Paints and Finishes:** Choosing low-VOC options ensures better indoor air quality and reduces harmful emissions.

### Spacious and Versatile Design

With their expansive layouts, barndominiums offer flexibility in design, allowing you to customize spaces according to your lifestyle. Whether you want an open-concept living area, a home office, or a creative studio, the spacious interiors enable endless possibilities. This adaptability means you don’t have to expand or relocate your living space as your needs change, further promoting sustainability.

### Connection to Nature

Barndominiums are often located on larger plots of land, providing an ideal opportunity to embrace outdoor living. Living in harmony with nature is a cornerstone of sustainable living. Here are a few ways to enhance your connection to the outdoors:

- **Landscaping with Native Plants:** This approach reduces water usage and creates a natural habitat for local wildlife.
- **Outdoor Living Spaces:** Decks and patios encourage more time spent outside, promoting a healthier lifestyle.
- **Gardening:** Growing your own fruits and vegetables not only provides fresh produce but also reduces reliance on store-bought goods.

### Cost-Effective Living

Building and maintaining a barndominium can be more affordable than traditional homes. Lower construction costs, reduced energy bills, and higher resale values make barndominiums a smart choice for those seeking sustainable living. Here are a few financial benefits:

- **Lower Construction Costs:** Using readily available materials often results in a more budget-friendly build.
- **Reduced Maintenance:** Barndominiums often require less upkeep than traditional homes, saving you money over time.
- **Higher Resale Value:** As more people seek sustainable living options, barndominiums tend to maintain or increase their value.

### Community and Lifestyle

Many who choose to live in barndominiums are part of tight-knit communities that prioritize sustainable living and outdoor activities. Being surrounded by like-minded individuals encourages a sense of belonging and support. Here’s how you can engage with the community:

- **Participate in Local Events:** Join community gardens or farmer's markets to foster connections and share sustainable practices.
- **Share Resources:** Collaborate with neighbors for tools or skills, promoting resourcefulness and community spirit.
- **Advocate for Sustainable Practices:** Engage in local discussions about sustainability and contribute ideas for community improvements.

In essence, choosing a barndominium as your living space presents countless benefits that contribute to sustainable living. From energy efficiency and sustainable materials to cost-effectiveness and community engagement, this modern housing option not only meets your family’s needs but also aligns with a responsible approach to living in the world we share. Making the decision to embrace this lifestyle is a step towards a more sustainable future for everyone.

### Conclusion

Creating a 40x50 barndominium isn’t just about building a home; it’s about designing a lifestyle that prioritizes efficiency and sustainability. With a myriad of floor plan options available, you can tailor your barndominium to reflect your unique style and functional needs. Whether you prefer an open concept layout or separate living spaces, the versatility of these structures greatly enhances your ability to create your dream home.

Moreover, a barndominium aligns seamlessly with modern values of sustainable living. The reduced material use, potential for solar energy integration, and lower environmental impact contribute to a greener footprint. This choice not only benefits you as a homeowner but also supports larger community efforts to promote environmentally responsible living.

Moreover, barndominiums often offer significant cost savings in both construction and maintenance, allowing you to invest in other areas of your life without sacrificing comfort or quality.

1kgpy7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1kgpy7d/how_do_i_know_if_its_worth_staying_waiting_for_him/,How do I know if its worth staying & waiting for him?,"Me(F22) & my bf (M22) have been together for 6 years. We get along good. We can make each other laugh. His family loves me, my parents like him. He is loyal & can be a kind person.

Although, he wont take me on dates (restaurants, movies, trying new snack shops) the excuses are “there are no good movies” or “i don’t want to tip someone” Even if I offer to pay he wont accept. 

He occasionally (as a joke) calls me retard, cunt, fagget. From time to time I can joke along. I call him dumbass back or dumb. But sometimes its a turn off. I just want to be called babe or baby once. And I always communicate how I feel & what I would like. Even in arguments he’ll make sure to call me retard, weirdo, or cunt. 

In March I found out he went to the club without my knowledge but told me he was sick & heading to bed. I didn’t understand why he would lie its okay for him to go I would just expect for him to say “hey im at the club with friend1 & friend2 text u when I can” thats it. He then also had a secret tiktok account where he searched up half naked women, twerking, being a thot online whatever. I shrug it off. Yes it bothered me, but I moved on. 

Im starting to question if I even want this relationship anymore. He smokes marijuana and drinks…a lot. I try to educate & communicate with him if he can settle down for a bit. I don’t care abt smoking it doesnt make you a bad person although can be an expensive habit as I seen from him. Am I wrong for that? He lusts over other women online. He makes me drive everywhere. To get food, to take him to work sometimes, to go on our dates IF we ever finally get to go on one. I have communicated that I would like a dinner at a restaurant or even a happy hour lunch to be able to dress up maybe wear my nice perfumes etc. He said it doesnt matter its cheaper. I also communicate that
maybe once in a while it would be nice to be the one in the passenger sit and he just throws bs excuses. For 5 years straight I would drive him left & right. From one side of the town to the other, to work etc. and I have never complained (he would sometimes voluntarily give gas money) one time he picked me up for food and at the end of the day complained that he had to take me back home (i live 3min from his house)

I’ve repeatedly communicated how I feel. Will ending it be a good idea? I know it would hurt (6 years is a long time) What if its a mistake to leave him? Is it his financial situation? He’s a 22yr old male working at a grocery store still
living w/ his parents, no work drive (he will call into work sometimes just so he can drink the night before) I try to also encourage a healthier diet & lifestyle like keeping his room clean or eating greener/leaner. To men, is it possible that he may be going through something internally & I should wait it out maybe see if things change? Or should I rip the bandaid off & ask for time apart due to my needs not being met. 

before anyone says anything. I cook food for him sometimes, I get him coffee, when he’s sick i take care of him. Im loyal. Im a nursing student as a part time beauty consultant and im fit and have been by his side for the past 6 yrs. I know I bring to the table. He is loyal, tall, cute and very funny and a good helping hand when asked. Ive gotten really
close to his family and his brother has a baby on tje way (this june she’s due) I would hate to lose that connection to his family they treat me so well,but I do not want to waste away my youth on sitting in his couch only settling for mcdonalds & him with an ipad just watching espn rather than having a conversation with me?

1kgpxwi,https://i.redd.it/zampn4u0saze1.jpeg,Must Read Protected Ex-wife by Z.YU,"# Chapter 1: Cheated

""I'm pregnant."" Just as Elsie Lawson was momentarily stunned, the woman added softly, ""It's Charlie's.""  
  
""You're lying!""  
  
""I'm not. I'm three months pregnant."" While speaking, the woman handed Elsie a medical check-up document as proof. When the latter saw Charlie Gardner's signature on it, her mind went blank.  
  
At this moment, her world was crumbling around her.  
  
The other spoke again, but she could no longer make out the words coming out of her mouth; she was only aware of the rage within her.  
  
""You shameless b\*tch!"" Slapping her across the face, Elsie roared at the top of her lungs, ""You're just as shameless as your mother!""  
  
""What are you doing?"" Following another angry voice, her mother-in-law suddenly appeared at the door.  
  
""Ask your son! He cheated on me with this wench and got her pregnant!"" Elsie shouted out of control, ""She's a b\*tch!""  
  
""How dare you shout at me?"" Mrs. Gardner widened her eyes in disbelief.  
  
Ignoring her, Elsie slapped the woman again. Upon receiving 2 blows at once, the latter stumbled backwards and fell to the floor.  
  
The next second, blood oozed down her calves, shocking Mrs. Gardner.  
  
Seeing how her painstaking efforts—her unborn grandson—was put in danger, Mrs. Gardner became furious at once. She rushed forward and slapped Elsie twice, yelling, ""You vicious woman, are you trying to kill her baby? Even if you are unable to conceive, must you ruin other's happiness?""  
  
Elsie felt a buzz in her head while her vision turned black. Losing her footing, she staggered backwards and collided against the sharp corner of the cabinet behind her.   
  
Although it was painful, she held onto the cabinet to prevent herself from collapsing. Just then, the door was pushed open, and a voice sounded. ""What's going on?""  
  
""Charlie! You came back at the right time! Quick, send Kenia to the hospital! That wicked b\*tch tried to murder my grandson! Hurry up!""  
  
Charlie's indifferent gaze swept across the scene; when he saw the blood running down Kenia Heath's legs, his eyes abruptly narrowed. Hurriedly, he rushed over and picked her up from the floor before rushing out just as quickly.  
  
Meanwhile, Elsie felt a burst of despair. The man hadn't even spared her a glance. Leaning against the cabinet, her body finally gave out and she slowly slipped down. Then, she felt a sticky liquid with her hand—blood.  
  
The rain started to drizzle outside the window and the noise woke Elsie up from her dream. The bedroom was dark, and she subconsciously reached out to touch her side.  
  
Then, she chuckled self-mockingly. Her smile stretched across her face, making her cheeks burn with pain; she was now fully awake.  
  
Elsie slipped out of bed and walked to the window barefooted. Lifting the curtains, she spotted several cars entering the villa in the misty rain.  
  
A bad feeling rose in her heart, but she was not sure yet.  
  
A man opened the car door while holding out an umbrella with respect. After that, she saw a familiar figure stepping out of the Maybach.  
  
For a moment, he stood in the yard and looked up at the window where Elsie was, as though he knew she would be right there.  
  
Even with the distance between them, she could still feel the coldness in his eyes. Smiling, she slowly walked out of the bedroom in her pyjamas.  
  
When the lights in the villa lit up, the face of a woman with dishevelled hair and a pallid complexion was reflected on the bright floor tiles; the awful appearance startled Elsie herself.  
  
After that, she moved down the stairs. When she turned the corner, she saw that Charlie and another man had already taken their seats on the couch in the living room.  
  
A strange smile appeared on the corner of her lips as she strode towards them. Seeing her walking over barefooted, Charlie's expressionless face finally showed a slight change, and even his grip on the couch tightened.  
  
After she had sat down opposite him, the man next to him took out a document and pushed it over. ""Madam, this is the divorce agreement Mr. Gardner told me to draft. Please take a look.""  
  
Picking up the document from the coffee table, she slowly opened it. The agreement was very short, and her eyes were fixed on the section compromising the agreement on the division of property. All the property belonged to Charlie, so she had no share of it.  
  
For some reason, her eyes stung and thus she blinked them reflexively, her tears easing the pain. The lawyer spoke again in an indifferent voice, ""Have you read through it? If yes, please sign it.""  
  
After saying that, he wasted no time handing her a pen. Elsie paused for a moment and glanced at Charlie; there was no expression on his face as he stared into space nonchalantly.  
  
Then, she reached out to take the pen and signed her name on the document. Seeing this, the lawyer looked relieved. After that, the room became very quiet as she got up to head upstairs.  
  
Charlie, who had been silent all the while, glanced at her back and then looked at the lawyer with a slight smile. When Elsie reached the stairs, she heard the lawyer saying, ""Ms. Lawson, please move out by tomorrow.""  
  
""Okay."" With a curt response, she slowly turned the corner of the stairs. Then, the lawyer added, ""All the property from your marriage with Mr. Gardner belongs to him, including any jewellery he had bought for you.""  
  
""Okay."" Her calmness puzzled the lawyer. Although she couldn't get a penny from the divorce, the amount of jewellery that Charlie had given her was worth more than enough for her to spend the rest of her life. Therefore, he didn't expect her to give them up so easily.  
  
Turning to look at Charlie, he noticed a trace of anxiety in the latter's eyes. When Elsie finally arrived on the second floor, she opened the bedroom door as she said with a clear and determined voice, ""Please tell your client that I won't take anything from him; I'll leave here bare-handed tomorrow. So, to be fair, tell him to return the things I gave him too.""  
  
As soon as she finished speaking, the door slammed shut behind her.  
  
""Um... Mr. Gardner?"" The lawyer looked at the taciturn Charlie.  
  
The latter remained silent, and just when the lawyer thought he was not going to reply, he suddenly uttered, ""Okay.""  
  


# Chapter 2: Annoying Black-Framed Glasses

 Three years later.  
  
...  
  
At Stroast South International Hotel, a hundreds-of-meters long red carpet stretched along the road with bouquets of colourful flowers and balloons decorated on both sides. On this day, Whizystems was holding an annual meeting here.  
  
Everyone in Stroast South knew that the CEO of Whizystems, Charlie Gardner, was a real business genius. It took him merely three years to graduate from university and start his own company.  
  
During the short period, he had continuously built his company into one of the largest entities in the world.  
  
As his business began to thrive and expand across the globe in the past few years, he made a name for himself on an international scale. Just recently, he had returned from overseas, and it was rumoured that he would start a new multi-billion dollar project million over there.  
  
Once the project succeeded, Charlie would undoubtedly climb even higher up the ladder. By then, no one in Stroast South would be able to compete with him.  
  
At noon sharp, several luxury cars slowly pulled to a stop in front of the hotel. The Rolls-Royce limo in the middle was particularly eye-catching, especially with its unique license plate. Instantly, it caused a stir among the crowd. ""Look, it's Charlie! Charlie is here!""  
  
The media reporters who had been waiting outside the hotel all raised their cameras at once. Numerous onlookers had also gathered around the hotel entrance, busily talking about the well-known business genius and wanting to catch a glimpse of him.  
  
A hotel staff stepped forward and opened the door respectfully. Then, a pair of shiny leather shoes appeared, followed by a pair of slender legs as Charlie exited the car.  
  
""Oh my God, he's gorgeous!"" someone in the crowd exclaimed.  
  
""He is so much better looking in real life!""  
  
Meanwhile, multiple blinding camera lights flashed one after another. However, Charlie calmly strode on the red carpet, leaving behind the noisy crowd of reporters and admirers.  
  
His secretary, Theo, followed closely behind with a briefcase in hand. After walking through the hotel lobby, the latter quickly went forward and pressed open the lift for Charlie to enter.  
  
Then, just as the lift door was closing, a figure in purple appeared in Charlie's sight. ""Wait a minute!"" he shouted in a hurry, but it was too late.  
  
""Mr. Gardner, what is it?"" Theo asked in surprise.  
  
""Never mind, I may have seen wrongly."" Closing his eyes, Charlie thought to himself, ""How could she possibly appear after disappearing for three years? She hates me. Even if she were to show up, she wouldn't come here of all places and occasions.""  
  
In the hotel lobby, Elsie was following a young man while struggling to carry a large bag. The man asked impatiently, ""What is my schedule for today?""  
  
""At one o'clock, you have an appointment with Mr. Rogers to discuss the collaboration project. At three o'clock, we will go to the old folks' home to do charity. You've also promised to have dinner with Mr. Allen; it will be his treat."" Looking at the card in her hand, she continued, ""By the way, Miss Lily is returning tonight—""  
  
""You will attend the dinner on my behalf.""  
  
""Me?"" Elsie gaped and then immediately shook her head. ""No! Mr. Reynolds, I can't!""  
  
""Why not?"" Cristopher Reynolds turned to look at her. He felt annoyed at the sight of her black-framed glasses; he despised women who wore glasses. However, Joel Graham had insisted on appointing her as his secretary.  
  
The first impression he had of Elsie was that she was too serious, old-fashioned, stubborn, and overbearing. Frivolous was in his nature, hence he felt extremely uncomfortable to suddenly have her by his side.  
  
Nevertheless, he had no choice but to accept her for Joel's sake.  
  
Though, it didn't mean he would treat her nicely. During the few months of working by his side, she had already been tortured by him countless times.  
  
Still, he had to say that she was really tough. No matter how he made things difficult for her, she would never say a word or complain to Joel. This was the only side of her that slightly comforted Cristopher.  
  
This time around, his grandfather had made him come to Stroast South to handle some business matters. Obviously, the former wanted to use this excuse to discipline him, and of course, he blamed it on Elsie. With her around, nothing good would befall him. Therefore, he hadn't thought twice before deciding to bring her along to the city to make her suffer with him.  
  
At first, she was very resistant to the idea of returning to Stroast South.   
  
Perhaps, Cristopher would have gone easy on her if she had agreed to tag along with him. Nonetheless, the more she resisted, the more he wanted to torture her. Thus, she had ended up coming here with him.  
  
""Mr. Reynolds, can't you send someone else? I'm dull; I can't hold a conversation and can't drink either... Besides, I'm ugly."" Seeing that he was staring at her, Elsie hastily pointed out her shortcomings in one breath.  
  
""It's good that you know how useless you are, but don't worry. I'm making you go exactly because of that. If you were smarter and prettier, I wouldn't have been willing to send you to those perverts."" Hearing his blunt words, she nearly choked.   
  
Then, he quickly added as he feared that she would threaten to resign again, ""Of course, you can refuse if you don't want your job anymore.""  
  
He strode out of the hotel after that, while Elsie was momentarily stunned before she ran to catch up with him.  
  


# Chapter 3: Bumping Into Enemies

 The crowd outside the hotel had yet to disperse; they were still talking about Charlie's grand entrance. On the other hand, Elsie trotted after Cristopher. At the mention of Charlie, she subconsciously quickened her pace.  
  
Just then, Cristopher suddenly stopped in his tracks and she bumped into his sturdy back, feeling a sharp pain on her forehead. Coupled with the ache in her heart, her nose turned sore and she couldn't stop her tears from falling.  
  
""Are you blind?"" With a tone of annoyance, he whirled around and scolded her. However, his words got stuck on the tip of his tongue upon seeing her watery eyes.  
  
Needless to say, he was shocked that the stone-cold woman was capable of shedding tears. After all, she had always been hardworking and headstrong. At this unexpected sight, his heart softened a little. ""Get in the car,"" he said as he opened the door for her. Although his tone was still very unkind, it sounded much better.  
  
Quietly, Elsie got into the car and then reached out to touch her forehead. It was still throbbing painfully, and she didn't know whether there was a wound. Meanwhile, Cristopher had taken notice of the small bruise on her forehead. All of a sudden, he found that her complexion was rather fair and smooth, much like that of his new flame, Lily, who was a fashion model.  
  
It was just that the black-framed glasses really put him off.  
  
With a snort, he uttered, ""I'll attend the dinner tonight.""  
  
""Really? Thank you, Mr. Reynolds!"" Elsie beamed. She was so elated that the pain was forgotten.  
  
""What are you thanking me for? I wasn't finished."" He glared at her as he added, ""You're coming with me.""  
  
""What?"" When the smile on her face fell instantly. Cristopher's spirits inexplicably lifted. It was then he realized that he was behaving rather oddly. He had never been bothered with the people he despised, so it was strange that he enjoyed teasing Elsie.  
  
After leaving the old folks' home later that afternoon, he ordered the driver to send them to the mall. Then, he strolled in the mall without care while she followed closely behind with his briefcase in her arms.  
  
Cristopher was handsome and appeared carefree, while Elsie looked old-fashioned and dull. Thus, they made a weird pair, attracting the curious gazes of the people around.  
  
Nevertheless, he paid no mind to them and strutted straight to the women's apparel section, walking past several branded stores.  
  
Finally, he stopped at the counter of a Chanel store and pointed at a dress, motioning the salesgirl to get it for him. ""Is that dress pretty?""  
  
""Yeah,"" Elsie replied casually.  
  
""Go and try it on.""  
  
Stunned, she said, ""Mr. Reynolds, my size and Miss Lily's are different."" After all, Lily was a model with a tall frame and long legs, while her frame was smaller in comparison.   
  
""Cut the crap and just do as I say,"" he reprimanded unhappily.  
  
Elsie helplessly put down the briefcase in silence and then picked up the dress before entering the fitting room. It had been three years since she last wore expensive and branded clothes like Chanel. Putting on the dress now, she couldn't help but feel nostalgic; Charlie had always bought her things from this brand, be it clothes or perfume.  
  
Back then, she had naively thought that it was a sign of love; but later, she'd learned just how incomplete the so-called love was. It turned out that Charlie had known from the beginning that their feelings wouldn't last long.  
  
With mixed emotions, Elsie got dressed and walked out of the fitting room. Then, Cristopher circled her and commented, ""It's not bad. I never imagined it would fit you nicely.""  
  
For some reason, he was excited to see her in this dress. As expected, one's dress up affected their appearance greatly; and now, the annoying black-framed woman suddenly seemed to be more pleasing to the eye. At least, the dress looked nice on her. ""You can wear this to the dinner. By the way, go and get your hair done and buy a pair of contact lenses.""  
  
""No!"" she refused subconsciously. At first, she thought that he had brought her here to buy clothes for Lily as the two were meeting up later. Now, she finally understood that he was planning to doll her up for her to accompany him to the dinner.  
  
""This is part of the job,"" Cristopher reminded her with a frown. No woman would refuse the temptation of beauty and luxury goods, yet she had taken him by surprise. ""You must listen to me.""  
  
""I'm just your secretary. Mr. Graham said that I could refuse unreasonable tasks you give me.""  
  
Her stubbornness rendered him furious and speechless, and he found her truly annoying. ""Fine, do whatever you want! You can refuse to wear the dress, but you must come with me tonight.""  
  
After that, he strode away. Elsie heaved a sigh of relief and quickly returned to the fitting room to change. When she came out, she bumped into a woman.  
  
""Elsie?"" The woman's voice was full of surprise and uncertainty.  
  
Elsie looked over expressionlessly and saw Kenia and her best friend, Amelia Sharp.  
  
""Hey, isn't this Mr. Gardner's ex-wife? How did she end up in this state?"" Looking at her old-fashioned clothes and the dress in her hand, Amelia's face flashed a mocking smile and her voice was extremely piercing.  
  
Elsie ignored her, handed the dress to the salesgirl, and then turned to leave. When Cristopher had asked her to come to Stroast South with him, she had expected to cross paths with Kenia sooner or later. However, she hadn't thought it would be so soon. Nevertheless, she regarded her as nothing more than a stranger.   
  
""Wow, look at her trying on that dress while looking like an absolute loser."" Meanwhile, Amelia raised her voice and continued, ""Don't tell me she's here to satiate herself?""  
  
""Amelia, stop it,"" Kenia said.  
  
""I'm telling the truth. She must have had a hard time after getting kicked out of the house without a penny on her. Look at her clothes, they are so old-fashioned and cheapskate. I truly didn't expect the Elsie we knew would turn into this!"" While jeering, Amelia reached out to grab the dress from the salesgirl. As her long nails scratched against the fabric, she feigned surprise and exclaimed, ""Dear, what happened to this dress?""  
  
""Miss, please wait a minute!"" The salesgirl stopped Elsie, who was about to leave, and showed her the hole in the dress.  
  
""Your nails scratched the dress, so...""  
  
Elsie stared at it in astonishment, then when she spotted the evil glint in Amelia's eyes, she realized that she was framed. ",1,1746596514.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Our companies have been working together since the beginning of the year and there’s not many of us in either company, so we’ve all become fairly acquainted. We mainly communicate in email, sometimes they come to our office and once every week I go to there office for a drive exchange. 

For privacy purposes I’ll use throwaway names. There’s this guy, we’ll call him Greg. He’s around my age, seems very sweet, and just kind of the typical quite nerdy IT guy. He had previously complimented my hair tinsel when he was out at our shop, i didn’t think much of it, just short conversation in a silent room. I went in this week for the drive exchange and he asked how often i change my hair tinsel, again didn’t think much of it, just short conversation. But then he says he has a none work related question (atp im still oblivious, i don’t normally see things unless im looking for them, and most the time im looking for them). He asks if i’d like to grab coffee or dinner sometime. I said “Sure!” and gave him my phone number. 

I feel so guilty for not lying… that sounds bad but why did i get myself into this situation?! I could have said I was seeing someone or that i wasn’t looking to date (which i’m not entirely looking but it’s not off my radar). This guy is sweet and doesn’t deserve to be strung along, but he isn’t my type. He is not the type of guy I see myself with long term, or really even short term. 

He called and we set up dinner plans for Friday evening. It should be fun and eventful, there’ll be live music and lots of people. I don’t want to assume this is a date, but i’m pretty sure it is… he called to reserve a table. 

AITH for not lying through my teeth to avoid going on a date with a work acquaintance?

1kgpulm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1kgpulm/i_had_a_thought_today/,I had a thought today,"It was actually an experience, really. But the thought was about how I so badly wanted to share it with you. Both because you’re the only person on the planet that would understand, but also because I imagined that you would think it was sorta cool, too. You see, I realized that there is no chance in hell that you don’t love me, because if you didn’t there isn’t a smoking guns chance in hell that you’d have done any of the things that you’ve done for me. I can’t even imagine what great feat this has been, nor how taxing this all must have been for you. I know that I don’t tell you as often as you deserve, and I’m working on that, too…but I wanted you to know how very grateful that I am for you. If there’s a peace prize category for patience, I’d award it to you. 

I know that my communication is still rusty (pretty sure my translator has battery acid built up) but I think it’s getting better every day. Wanna know a fun fact or two? 1. I love to hear the vibration of your voice…it reminds me of a magical place where I swear the trees sing a lullaby in the breeze; b. The language we speak is one of the most beautiful and unique things about us…and, 3. I don’t just love you-I love us.

And while I do love you for all that you have done to help save me from myself, my love for you runs pretty much the course of my life with you. From epic dance offs (seriously, why do you have a pencil in your pocket!?), to intimate settings (there’s just something about bathrooms as a holy sanctuary between us two), and magical mystery tours in the forest (seriously, it was 3 hours…I counted), to interstellar plots for world peace (satellite style)…that’s just to name a few. I’m excited to learn where this next iteration of us will go…Bonny and Clyde, maybe?

There’s just so many things that I look forward to learning about you. Snails pace, or no lol. I want to know what it feels like to fully hold your hand…they’re beautiful and hard not to want to touch. I want to hear the sound of your voice when you first wake up. And I want to know how it would feel to sit next to you and watch the sunrise (or set), to dance with you to your favorite tune, to learn what movies make you sad and which ones make you cry. I want to call you up and tell you about something exciting that happened and have you call me, too. I want you to ask me for coffee, or tea, or a soda…water? and I’ll do the same for you. I’d loved to hear your thoughts about whatever is on your mind…or sit in silence beside you, too. 

I look forward to the day that you just come knock on my door, call, write or text me or more, to tell me the story about all of the places that you’ve been before. Sincerely looking forward to any chance that I get to learn more about the beautiful you that is you once more💜

Helping people with their problems and conflicts gave me a sense of purpose. However, in 2023, I stopped doing that because of my ex he isolated me from everyone.

Recently in 2025, a bhaiya from my society, who is 31 years old (I’m 18), has been insisting that I give him therapy. I told him I’m not qualified for that, especially after learning about the ethics of psychology in my class 12 syllabus. I explained that, at best, I can listen and be supportive.

He’s a good person,very friendly, social, and fun to hang out with. We met in 2023 while playing basketball in our society. Two days ago, he confided in me that he’s divorced. His wife cheated on him, which shocked me because they had a five-year-long relationship, including three years of dating and two years of marriage. They looked like a perfect couple happy, with three international trips in one year.

I told him, “Bhaiya, don’t take it personally. It’s not about you, it’s about them.” After that, he started opening up even more. He did mention that it felt a bit strange talking about such personal things with an 18-year-old, but at the same time, he said he felt comfortable with me and thought I could help.

I suggested therapy, but he isn’t ready for that yet. We exchanged Instagram IDs, then started chatting on WhatsApp. He called me his little sister and friend. He’s genuinely sweet and kind, and he asked when we could meet. I told him we could meet the next day at the society club. He asked whether I preferred mocktails or coffee ? I said coffee, and he offered to bring it for me.

Even though he seems nice, I became a little paranoid (thanks to all the Crime Patrol and Savdhaan India I’ve watched!). So I asked my most trusted friend to pick me up at 8:30 from the club, just to be safe.

I feel bad for him, this was his first love and his only relationship. Now he’s going through a lot, especially with his mother battling stage 4 cancer. He’s reacting like a heartbroken teenager, and I genuinely want to help by just being there to listen.

But at the same time, I live in a typical Indian society. I don’t want people to talk badly about us, especially because of the noticeable age gap. I’m also not close enough to him yet to feel completely comfortable.

He said, “I don’t know why I’m telling all this to an 18-year-old.” I replied, “You’re not thinking clearly right now you’re emotionally vulnerable, and that’s why you feel comfortable opening up to me.”
I avoid texting him too much because it feels a bit weird to me. I told him we can meet for an hour a few times a week, during which he can explain everything from the beginning, and then we can try to figure out some solutions together. I also made it clear that I need to focus on my CUET exam right now.

Honestly, I think the friend who picked me up might be judging me a little. I don’t know if he thinks I’m being naive or stubborn,maybe he’s just being protective but I can sense something. I shared all of this just to feel a little lighter, because I can’t talk to anyone else about bhaiya’s situation. I really hope he decides to go to therapy soon.

At one point, he even told me that his ex-wife made her account public again and started watching his stories. He asked me, “How can I make her jealous?

1kgpqq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kgpqq5/swollen_belly_years_of_itching_please_help/,"Swollen belly, years of itching. Please help!","33F. This has taken place over the past week or so. I've only been actually logging things for the past four days. My memory sucks so please excuse me for not knowing exactly how long things have been going on. Pics from the last 3 days in comments. 
Tl;dr at end.

It's a pretty long story and I'm not sure where to start so I'll just go for it.

For a few days around the 1st-3rd ish (May) I was feeling extreme fatigue and the lymph nodes in my neck felt pretty swollen. Not too crazy but swollen. These were my only symptoms. This has happened several times before, especially in the past year, and I assume it's when my body is just fighting something off. 

(I do get sick very often: lots of colds, COVID a few times and a very bad case a year ago, very prone to strep (usually get it a couple times a year); I'm also extremely prone to skin infections and get them very often; also UTIs and yeast infections.)

So just for fun I decided to Google just ""swollen lymph nodes and fatigue."" A top result was lymphoma. I wasn't considering that I had it or anything, but I read about it just because I didn't know anything and was curious. 

I read that a symptom can be itching; for some types it's especially the feet and legs and at night, and a type of itching that feels like it's beneath the skin. I was in shock because this is exactly what I have had continuously for several years. I don't remember exactly when it started, but I think around 2021. I for sure asked a doctor about it in 2022. 

It's basically what it said: intense itching all over. It is usually the worst in my feet and secondly my legs. I'm usually more itchy than most people during the day, but at night when I go to bed and start to relax, it hits pretty suddenly. Some nights it's less bad. The only pattern I've noticed is this: I've been a heavy drinker off and on (a long story in and of itself, but overview is that I was a 24/7 alcoholic for a few years, got sober in 2022 and stayed sober for 7 months, and since then have been binge drinking like 1-4 nights a week)--the itching is the worst the night after a night of binging. But that's the only pattern. 

[And I have decided recently to cut way back on alcohol; have had two drinks in about 3 weeks.]

I've asked a lot of doctors about it and tried a lot of things. One said it might be allergies and gave me a med (I don't remember what it was, but more potent than OTC) that did nothing. One said something like ""idk probably drugs and alcohol"" (I also was a heroin user but got clean in 2018 and haven't used since.) A couple doctors just said they didn't know. 

I've ruled out any skin irritants. I haven't had any type of rash or weird skin things. I've tried different anti itch and regular lotions; some help just a little bit but that's it. It really feels like an issue with my nerves or something, not the skin; it feels like it's under the skin. I have googled the hell out of it for years, anything I can possibly think of. The closest possibility has been liver issues, but itching seems to only be in severe cases, and my liver levels have been tested many times in the past few years and are always fine. No description of itching I've ever seen has been specifically like mine--until a few days ago. 

And then, soon after reading that, my belly has gotten super swollen. 

It's been moderately swollen for a long time. I've chalked it up to belly fat. I recently learned that mirtazipine, which I've been on for years, can exacerbate it. I went down from 45mg to 15mg I think two months ago. I've been actively trying to lose weight especially the last 6 months or so. I was around 125lb-130lb and got down to maintaining 115-120 (but it has fluctuated a lot). The past probably two months I've gone extra hard dieting, and the last time I went to a doctor, on April 15th (for a skin infection), I weighed 113, which is the least I have since I was 17. (I stupidly don't have a scale so this was the last time I knew my weight.) But my belly was still large. 

But around May 2nd or 3rd I started to notice it increasing in size. I hadn't changed anything in my diet or activity level. It has gotten very concerning quickly. The night of the 4th I was super worried and went to the ER. 

At the ER, they did a very quick physical exam (I was laying down and they pressed on it in like 3 spots). They then did blood work and a CT scan. They told me that the blood work looked normal. They said the only abnormal thing in the CT scan was that I was kind of constipated. (I hadn't been having a lot of bowel movements but still something daily and I hadn't been eating much and didn't feel constipated.) They told me to take a laxative. 

I am so confused. It seems to have only gotten worse since then (again, I need to get a scale). Pics in the comments are of the last three days. 

I took docusate sodium the nights of the 
4th and 5th. The evening of the 6th I had cramps and then diarrhea (what seemed to be all of the contents of my intestines). The most recent picture was about 6 hours after that. 

I've been barely eating because it makes the very uncomfortable bloated feeling even worse. The 5th and 6th I had probably less than 700 calories. The 6th (before that picture) I only had a granola bar and glass of oat milk. And it still looked that bad.

I'm just so confused as to how the ER didn't find anything. My body feels so very not okay. I feel like my belly is going to explode. I don't know what to do. 

Any and all advice is much appreciated. I'm happy to answer any questions.

--

I have autism, ADHD, bipolar 1, and GAD.
 
I have GERD and genital herpes. 

I have high blood pressure. I have had heart issues (tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain) and saw a cardiologist in 2024. They did an ECG and didn't see anything concerning. 

[Another symptom I have had the past 5 or so days is that my BP has been spiking around 1-4am every day (I go to sleep around 4 or 5am; I take propranolol ER daily around 1-3pm.) When this happens I take an extra 10-20mg IR propranolol (cardiologist said this was ok)]

I am on:

Propranolol ER 60mg

Adderall 20mg ER

Lamotrigine 100mg 2x/day

Valacyclovir 500mg (I've taken it daily for maintenance for 10 years. About two months ago I had an outbreak on it for the first time ever and increased to 500mg 2x/day for a week or two.)

Mirtazipine 15mg (down from 45mg about 2-3 months ago)

Hydroxyzine 50mg

Bupropion 150mg SR

Doxepin 3mg

Famotidine 20mg (used to also take omeprazole for GERD daily for years; stopped 1-2 months ago with no major issues)

Melatonin 5mg

L-Tryptophan 500mg

Smoke some weed most nights, not much.

Also got some mushroom coffee stuff (Everyday dose); seems to only rarely have side effects; have been drinking 1 small cup every day for a week or so (realized there's a chance it's making my belly worse so stopped).

--

Tl;dr: 

I have had a lot of health issues, especially the past several years. Have had extreme itching especially on legs and feet and at night for several years. Doctors have had no answers. Have had bad fatigue for a week (despite sleeping 9-12 hours most nights). Belly has become very swollen within the past 4-5 days. ER did blood work and CT scan, only found that I was mildly constipated. Took docusate sodium and had diarrhea today. Have barely eaten for three days. Belly hasn't gotten less swollen. Help please!

Thank you so much y'all, I appreciate you.

1kgpqfs,https://i.redd.it/v1w1nx4hpaze1.jpeg,How to read online 365 Days with My Billionaire by F.T Lowe ?,"# CHAPTER 1

 JANUARY  
  
SARAH   
  
Life isn’t a bed of roses.  
  
I learned that bitter truth at a very young age when my parents died in a ghastly car accident. At age five, I didn’t understand why everyone around me was crying and saying their condolences, but I knew that something bad had happened and when my parents never came to pick me up from my Aunt Bella’s house, I figured they were gone forever.  
  
‘’Aunty, why won’t mummy and daddy come back for me? Don’t they love me anymore?’’ I would ask as I clung to my favourite teddy bear, Mr. Snuggles, gifted to me on my second birthday.  
  
‘’They loved you so much,’’ Aunt Bella would say in between tears and hiccups, “even more than you could ever imagine. But they’re in heaven now and they’re watching over you.’’  
  
After the accident, Aunt Bella, who was thirty at the time and my father’s younger sister, was granted sole custody of me. She was the only relative willing to take me in and she raised and took care of me like I was her daughter. She did everything a parent would do even though she had little to no idea of how to raise a five-year-old. I believed she raised me well because I didn't turn out to be a bad person.  
  
“Aunt Bella, I’m home,’’ I said as I approached the door of the house I’d known for the most part of my life. I put the key in the keyhole and turned it, breathing in the familiar scent I’d grown to love. Every morning, as a routine, Aunt Bella always put two scented candles in the living room. According to her, it helped to expel demons and chase away bad omens. She most likely read that in one of those fashion and beauty magazines she indulged in from time to time.  
  
“I’m here,’’ she responded in between coughs. I dropped my bag to the ground and rushed to her side. “Are you okay? Do you need water?’’ She nodded wordlessly and I grabbed the flask from the table next to her. Pouring the clear liquid into the glass, I brought it to her lips. ‘’I can’t stand this anymore. We need to see a doctor. Something is going on.’’  
  
“No, I’m fine,’’ she protested immediately. ‘’It’s just a little cough. I don’t need to see a doctor.’’  
  
It was more than that and she knew it. A “little cough” does not last for six months; she was way too stubborn to go to the hospital no matter how many times I had begged her to. She didn’t want to face the reality of her apparent condition, but I did.   
  
If anything happened to her...I wouldn’t even want to think about my life without her. I googled her symptoms a while ago and everything pointed to cancer, the one thing I feared. I refrained from telling her because it was not easy to convince a fifty-four-year-old, Texan-born and bred, strong-willed superwoman to do something she was not willing to consider even for a moment.  
  
“It’ll go away soon.’’  That was her favourite mantra! ‘’In the meantime, tell me about your day. How was job hunting?’’   
  
As usual, she changed the subject and I bit my lip in frustration.   
  
“Horrible,’’ I groaned. “I’m not qualified for any of these jobs. I dropped my resume at a couple of places but I haven’t had a callback.’’   
  
I wasn’t a bad student in high school; I wasn’t a genius either, but I got above-average grades. My teenage years were rocky because I struggled with mental health problems, an eating disorder, and I did drugs at some point. My parents' death, coupled with a teenage rebellious spirit was the only excuse I had at the time for my behaviour. I put my aunt through hell and I was insufferable. I was surprised she didn’t kick me out of her house because she had every reason to. That was one of the reasons why I loved her. She put up with my bullshit and never gave up on me, even when I was a mess.   
  
I managed to get my high-school diploma and got offers to go to colleges in and out of state, but I declined them all. Going to college straight out of high school was not the path I wanted to take. Aunt Bella thought it was unusual, but she didn’t question the direction I had chosen. At the ripe age of eighteen, I kissed her goodbye and backpacked all around the world: I worshipped with Buddhists in India, volunteered at a disability centre in Croatia, taught English to school-aged children in a remote village in Kenya, and basked in the sun and surfed with a few natives in the aborigines of Australia.  
  
Traveling the world for three years was a learning experience, a chance for me to discover who the real Sarah Lane was, not the ‘girl whose parents died in a car accident’ as I was fondly called in high school. A million faces and locations later, however, I felt a void. Sure, I intended to discover myself and to an extent I did, but I missed my aunt-the one person who didn’t abandon me or leave me in the cruel hands of the foster care system. Phone calls daily and regular postcards during the holidays weren’t enough so, after three years of exploring, I came back to Angelwood, Texas.  
  
After my arrival, I got a job at a coffee shop called Surburbia, which was a walking distance from my aunt’s house. I had been working there ever since.The tips were good and that was partly because Surburbia was located in the heart of a host of big tech companies. CEO’s, CFO’s, COO’s and tech moguls frequented the shop, not necessarily because the coffee was five-star quality (Aunt Bella made better coffee in her sleep), but it was proximate.  
  
However, the owner of Surburbia sold it, without so much as a thirty-day notice or warning to his employees, to some company and I was now left without a job while the coffee shop had already been turned to rubble.   
  
“I’m sure they’ll call you soon. Good things sometimes take time,’’ Aunt Bella reassured me, trying to be optimistic, but I didn’t share her enthusiasm. Why? Because disappointment and I were best friends at this point. The last thing I’d ever do is get my hopes up. With only a high school diploma and a competitive job market, the odds were not in my favour.  
  
“Why don’t you consider going to college?” Aunt Bella said as she curled on the couch. ‘’You have the means to. It’ll give you an edge.’’  
  
I knew what she was talking about but I had a nagging feeling in my stomach that she had cancer, denial or not. Treatment was going to be expensive and I needed to be prepared, even if it meant sacrificing my college fund.   
  
""I'm saving the money for you. College can wait.""  
  
‘’Absolutely not!’’ she objected immediately. “Your parents left you that money so you could go to college. Besides, I have health insurance.’’  
  
And a pile of debts to pay. Her health insurance was not going to be enough to cover cancer treatments.  
  
Before they died, my parents set up a college fund for me and left it in the bank. I was eligible to access it once I turned eighteen but I left it where it was because I didn’t want it. It was a cruel reminder that they were never coming back.   
  
I referred to it as blood money.  
  
""Trust me on this one. You need it more than I do. I could always get a student loan.’’  
  
Aunt Bella insisted. “I won’t allow you to blow over forty-thousand dollars on me. It’s your inheritance.’’  
  
“You’re my inheritance,’’ I responded lovingly as I gave her a hug on the sofa. “If you didn’t take me in and raise me, I don’t know what my life would have been like. I love you so much and I want to take care of you. Please, let me do that.’’   
  
My eyes landed on the framed pictures on the wall, pictures depicting important moments in my life that she documented, like my sixth birthday, my first soccer game, and our first Christmas together. Hell, she even framed the first time I sprained my ankle while I was playing catch with a couple of kids in Angelwood Park..  
  
“I still object,’’ she said softly. “You can’t throw your life away for me. I’m older and you have your whole life ahead of you.’’  
  
That earned her an eye roll from me and a smile. “You’re not old at all. You’re still as young as ever.’’ Aunt Bella looked good for her age. Many people assumed we were siblings because we looked alike: dirty blonde hair, hazel eyes, narrow nose, and full lips. We came from a family of blondes, so the similarities were very striking.   
  
“I can’t wait for you to go out on a date,’’ I squealed at the possibility of her finally getting a boyfriend. ‘’That’s why I want you to get better, so you can go out and meet people. You’ve dedicated your whole life to taking care of me and I’m older now. I want you to live your life.’’  
  
As usual, she waved me off dismissively. The topic of dating and marriage didn’t appeal to her. She once told me that it was better to remain single than divorced and in a custody battle with an ex like most of her friends who had married early. When I came into her life after my father’s death, it was an answer to her prayers. She didn’t want marriage but she did want a child. She had me and she was happy and is still happy, I guess. I don’t know if she ever dated anyone; if she did, she never brought any of them around me and she never introduced anyone as her boyfriend.  
  
“I’m fine just the way I am.’’  
  
Deciding not to push it, I changed the subject. “I got a call back from this company called Onyx and Co. It’s just down the street from Surburbia, so that’s good news.’’  
  
I applied to be a personal assistant to the CEO of Onyx and Co three months ago. After not hearing from them, I assumed they tossed my resume in the trash because I wasn’t qualified. Again, I didn’t get my hopes up.  
  
‘’You should have started with that, sweetie,’’ Aunt Bella responded, elated. ‘’When did you get a callback?’’  
  
‘’Today.’’ After another failed job interview. ‘’On my way home, I received a call from them. They said my interview is tomorrow by nine am.’’ I tried to contain the grin that was threatening to erupt from my face. Finally, someone was giving me a chance. It was hardly a victory lap, but I was happy either way.  
  
“We should celebrate. I can order pizza if you like,’’ she offered as she attempted once again to stand up from the sofa. “I haven’t gotten the job yet, plus you should still lay down.” Kicking my shoes off from my feet and holding the three-inch heels in my hands, I moved to the kitchen. ‘’Have you eaten?’’  
  
‘’Pork Roast. Ordered it from Munchies. Your portion is in the fridge.’’  
  
‘’Yum.’’  
  
“You should be excited,’’ Aunt Bella called out, though the words came out croaked. “Something tells me that you’re going to get that job.’’  
  
“I hope you’re right,” I whispered to myself.  
  


# CHAPTER 2

 ONYX  
  
“Good morning, Mr Bradford.”  
  
“Good morning, sir.  
  
“Lovely day, Mr Bradford.”  
  
I simply nodded in acknowledgment of the greetings from my employees, my phone pressed to my ear. With every stride my legs took to the glass-covered office, I could feel their watchful, admiring, and fearful eyes on me. I was used to the attention so it didn’t bother me. Once I twisted the door handle of my office, I could’ve sworn I heard them breathe a sigh of relief.   
  
Working with me was intense and cut-throat because my expectations were nothing short of perfection. A slip-up or an attempt of it meant kissing your job goodbye and boarding the next plane to Nirvana because you’d never live it down.   
  
I paid my employees well, even more than the average employer, and they all knew that. That was why I expected them to be nothing short of the best. If their best wasn’t good enough for me, which in most cases it never was, given that I had fired my personal assistant yesterday and two interns the day before, then there were other jobs elsewhere.  
  
“Kathy, get me my coffee, black,” I said gruffly through the intercom as I settled down on my swivel chair.  
  
Oh, right. I fired Kathy.  
  
I always had the intention of firing her, hence why I told HR to start looking for her replacement three months ago. The brunette was getting on my last nerve and yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. She had messed up my schedule and made me miss a meeting with an important investor who was willing to buy stakes in the company.  
  
That was not the only time she slipped up. A month before her termination, she had booked me the wrong flight, and two months before that, she had canceled a business meeting with a Chinese company because she thought it was what the boss said.  
  
I had endured her many errors for two years, but there was only so much I could take. The only thing she was good at was making unwanted passes at me.  
  
As if I would ever sleep with any of my employees.  
  
Being the CEO of the biggest social networking service in the world was not an easy task. Renegade, my brainchild, was an idea I had back when I was an undergraduate student at Simpleton University studying business administration per my father’s wishes. As his only son, I was slated to take over the family business, the decision already made before I even began high school.  
  
Wanting to step out of my father's shadow for once, I began working on Renegade along with my best friend Bryson Knox in our dorm room. The idea was to create a community where people would be able to air out their opinions with no f\*\*\*s given (f\*\*\*s are now given because offensive comments are being flagged and removed) but that was the point.  
  
Bryson, a computer science major at the time, created the domain name and the codes and handled the technical aspects of Renegade. I dealt with the marketability. The prototype was developed and launched as an internal app for university students on Simpleton’s campus.  
  
Long story short, it became popular among the students, and the full version was released to the world a few years after the launch on campus. The only way was up from there. In order to manage Renegade, Bryson and I formed Onyx & Co six years ago. Renegade became the most used social networking service in the world with a monthly user rate of three hundred and forty-five million and the app is available in over sixty-five countries.  
  
I was proud of everything Bryson and I had achieved in such a short time and it was only possible through hard work and determination...with a little help from our parents, of course. My father wasn’t supportive of the idea of creating a social media app initially because he thought it would divert my attention from my studies, but my mother was my biggest cheerleader and she somehow convinced him to invest in the business.  
  
Bryson’s parents were a lot more liberal than mine. When we told them about the app and our need for investments, they consented in a heartbeat.  
  
The telephone rang, pulling me out of my thoughts.  
  
“Yes?’’  
  
‘’Sir,’’ Mrs Wilkinson, the head of the HR department’s voice filled my ear, “the interviews for your new assistant are about to begin. Should I send them up or do you need more time?’’  
  
“Send them up.’’  
  
“Will do, sir.”  
  
This was not how I wanted to start my Tuesday morning.   
  
Truth be told, I had completely forgotten that the interviews were today. After the incompetence and unprofessional conduct that Kathy displayed, I didn’t trust HR anymore to make the final decision on who would become my personal assistant. Of course, I got swarmed with paperwork and the interviews completely skipped his mind.   
  
If I had an assistant, I would have remembered.  
  
“This is why I need a f\*\*\*\*\*g assistant,’’ I whispered to no one in particular as I thumbed my desk for a pen and paper, scribbling down the questions I would ask my potentials.  
  
“My head is killing me.’’   
  
It was all thanks to Bryson. Yesterday, he literally dragged me to the grand opening of a club his friend owned, knowing full well that the next day was a workday. Long story short, I drank, sobered up this morning, and was now desperately looking for Advil. I pulled the last of the desk drawers open and found the drug. I popped it into my mouth like a c\*\*\*k addict and doused it with a bottle of water I brought from home. Instantly feeling some sort of relief, I tousled my dark-brown hair with my hands and shot lasers at the paperwork I had to go through before the end of the day.  
  
The phone rang again and I sighed in irritation. Picking it up, I heard the firm tone of Mrs. Wilkinson again. “It’s time, sir.’’  
  
I still needed coffee.  
  


# CHAPTER 3

 SARAH  
  
My three-inch heels clanked on the cobblestone floor, dark pantsuit and jacket flying as I zoomed past people in a desperate hurry to make it to my scheduled interview at Onyx & Co. People on the street looked at me like I was crazy, and it wasn’t far from the truth. I was going crazy because my one big shot was about to be blown by my exquisite time-keeping skills.              
  
Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would get a callback. I saw the qualifications the company was looking for( first class degree in any discipline from a four-year university, two to five years of experience working as a personal assistant, proficiency in Microsoft Office, among others). I had none of those under my belt, but as Pink, my favourite singer, once said, You gotta get up and try.  
  
Try I did and the universe decided to have mercy on me.   
  
Either that or my resume pleased one person in the HR department.  
  
Back when I worked at Surburbia, I had often see people go in and out of the glass double doors of Renegade in their pristine and well-put-together work suits. The place screamed opulence and importance. It also screamed uptight and having a stick-in-your-ass. The employees would constantly complain about how grueling and tedious their work was thanks to one name that always came up in their conversations-Onyx Bradford. I was never one to pry into the affairs of others and I didn’t particularly like to listen to gossip, but it kept me entertained while I was working for over six hours.  
  
Onyx Bradford, the new Jack Dorsey of the tech world, was a no-nonsense, cutthroat type of individual. At least, that was what his employees painted him as. He sounded like a tyrant who would snap your neck if you so much as breathed the wrong way.  
  
They said he'd fire you if you arrived a minute late for work.  
  
They said he'd fire you if your w\*\*\*\*y reports were not “to his taste and liking.”  
  
They said he'd fire you if you messed up his coffee order.  
  
I wondered if that was what got his last assistant fired.  
  
He had no street credibility in the eyes of his employees, yet here I was standing in front of the skyscraper-like building, panting like I had just run a marathon.   
  
The logo of the company-the letters “O & C” painted in dark blue and encapsulated in a glass cube-was supported by a glass stand next to the double doors of the company. Onyx Bradford must have a glass fetish or something because everything, at least from the outside, looked...fragile.  
  
But that was the least of my concern.  
  
I gasped when I looked at the time on my watch and stopped ogling the logo. The interview was scheduled for nine am but it was nine thirty-two am.   
  
I wasn’t the type that made it a habit of being late for anything. Aunt Bella once told me that first impressions make a lasting impression. Turning up thirty-two minutes late painted me in a bad light. But I had an excuse, a valid one, even though no one in the company controlled by a tyrant would particularly care about my family troubles.  
  
Aunt Bella had a ‘little cough’ that was more violent than the other ones she had. It made her vomit and she looked paler than the sky on a rainy day. I had to stay behind to make sure she was okay enough for me to leave for a few hours. Job interview or not, my family came first.  
  
That was non-negotiable.  
  
Thank heavens the company wasn’t far from home. It was a ten-minute walk, twenty in heels and twenty-five if one trips in said heels and breaks an ankle.   
  
I didn’t break my ankle.   
  
Without looking in the mirror, I knew I looked like a hot mess. A whiff of my armpit told me that I smelled like sweat and Swiss Rose perfume. My white shirt was most likely crinkled and from the wetness I could feel on my back, I knew it was soaked. I always had the propensity to sweat easily. That earned me the name of ‘Sweaty Sarah’ in elementary school. Children could be cruel, but as I matured, I realized that it was something I couldn’t control.   
  
It was my...biological nature and it was covered by a dark jacket and a nervous smile as I approached the lady at the front desk who I assumed was the receptionist.  
  
‘’Hello,” I said.  
  
The lady in question, a blonde just like me, paid me no mind as she typed away on her computer. The silence was awkward as I bounced one foot in front of the other, deliberating whether to say anything more.   
  
Surely she’s not deaf.  
  
My awkwardness quickly turned to irritation. Curtsey at least demanded that one must respond when spoken to.  
  
“Excuse me, Miss-“  
  
‘’If you’re here for the interview,’’ she finally stopped typing and looked me up and down, doing a quick scan of my outfit. What followed was a shake of her head, “please have a seat on the left.’’ She pointed to an array of dark coloured chairs where people competing for the same position as I was were.  
  
‘’You’re late.’’  
  
Thank you, Captain Obvious.  
  
‘’But you’re lucky because we haven’t started yet.’’  
  
That piece of helpful information made me visibly relaxed. The lady, whose ID card read Esther, gave me a small smile. “Here.” She handed me a handkerchief with the company logo embedded in it.   
  
‘’Thanks,’’ I responded, slightly embarrassed.  
  
I walked over to the array of seats and settled next to an African-American man who was typing away on his phone. I wondered how he could be typing when we were minutes away from being interviewed. My nerves were getting the best of me so bringing out my phone from my bag was out of the question.  
  
“…and he’s so hot.” I turned my attention to the women sitting across from me. They were deeply engrossed in a conversation that was loud enough for me to hear.  
  
“Definitely,” the red-haired, pale-skinned one nodded her head, “and so young too. I can’t believe he built all this from scratch.”  
  
“I know, right,’’ her companion, a dark-haired woman of African-American descent agreed. “I can’t wait to be his personal assistant just so I can stare at him all day,” she sighed dreamily.  
  
Of course, they were talking about Onyx Bradford. How could they not? Minutes away from being interviewed, the best thing to do was openly gossip about their potential boss’s...admirable features.  
  
If he was anything like what his employees painted him out to be, one would be staring at a soulless brick wall.   
  
I giggled at my own joke and that earned a raised eyebrow from my seat partner. I gave him a sheepish smile and continued listening to the conversation that wasn’t my business.  
  
“I heard he’s mean though, Carrie.”  
  
“Who cares?” The red-haired woman, now identified as Carrie, answered nonchalantly. ‘’He’s hot and totally bangable. Why do you think the ratio of women applying for this job is higher than the men?’’   
  
In my haste, I hadn’t noticed my surroundings but Carrie was correct. I could headcount about thirty of us and twenty-six were women.  
  
My reasons were my own, but I definitely didn’t...well run into Onyx & Co looking like a drenched cow thinking that the CEO was ‘bangable’. I couldn’t verify the truth or fallacy of her statement because I only knew the man’s name. I hadn’t seen him in person or in pictures.   
  
It sounded bizarre considering Onyx was a public figure and I was a frequent Renegade user but it was the truth. I had never searched for his profile on Google before and I foolishly didn’t do a little bit more research on the company before I applied for the job.   
  
I was definitely going to war without the proper ammunition.  
  
But on the bright side, I wasn’t without any information about Onyx. I knew what his employees said about him. I knew he was very rich considering Renegade’s huge success. It has been the app of the year for three non-consecutive years. I also knew that he was strict and ‘bangable’, to put it in Carrie’s lingo.  
  
“You’re so loud,” Carrie’s companion cautioned . ‘’Someone might hear us.’’   
  
You think?  
  
“May I have your attention please?”   
  
We all turned toward the voice. An African-American woman stepped out of the elevator with a clipboard in hand and stood in front of us. A couple of employees who passed by greeted her with a bow of their heads and she returned their greetings with a nod. Turning her attention back to us, she waited for the chatter to die down before speaking again.  
  
She looked like she was in her early fifties. Her pixie-cut hairstyle reminded me of Halle Berry for some reason. She definitely looked like her from my vantage point and she had a trim, fit figure. Her dark blue pantsuit screamed ‘mess with me and I'd cut your ear off.’  
  
She wasn’t smiling. I didn’t expect her to. The receptionist hadn’t smiled when I walked in, so maybe smiling was prohibited.  
  
“Welcome to Onyx and Co,” she said in a clipped tone. “My name is Shonda Wilkinson and I’m the head of the HR department here at Renegade. Once I call your name, you'll head into this elevator,” she motioned to a second elevator next to the one she came out from, “and press the button to the top floor. There you will be interviewed by the CEO himself.”  
  
Murmurs erupted from our lips along with a few gasps. Since when do CEOs conduct personal interviews? How does he even have the time to do that? What’s the point of having an HR department if you’re going to do their jobs for them?  
  
“Simmer down. You need not fear.”   
  
Oh, there was plenty to fear.   
  
I wasn't the only one that heard the rumours about Onyx Bradford’s work ethic. His reputation definitely preceded him because Carrie’s companion was visibly shaking.  
  
I thought she would be happy because minutes ago she and Carrie’s tongues were talking big about Onyx being ‘bangable.’  
  
Mrs Wilkinson continued. “It’s just an interview.”  
  
With an alleged tyrant.  
  
She looked at her watch and sighed. “Well, good luck to you all, and may the best man or woman win.” She scanned our faces. ‘’Trust me, you’re going to need the good luck.’’  
  
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking,“Am I even normal?” While most people my age are buying new clothes, flexing jewelry, or eating out at trendy restaurants, I’m here throwing whatever extra cash I have into crypto. Like, religiously.

A little payday? Straight to my portfolio. Got a bonus? That’s going into some altcoin I’ve been stalking for days. I’ll pass on the steak dinner if it means I can buy the dip. I’m not even ashamed,I'm literally addicted to the idea of gains.

It’s not even about getting rich quick (okay maybe a little), but there's just something so thrilling about watching your money grow while others blow theirs on stuff they won’t even remember next week. Some call it risky. I call it calculated. I’d rather miss out on a shopping haul than miss a breakout.

And honestly? I’m just thinking long-term. I don’t want to be working ‘til I’m 60, barely surviving on some pension. I want to retire early, chill hard, and live life on my own terms. Like imagine waking up with no alarms, sipping coffee while watching your portfolio do its thing. That’s the dream tbh.

I’m also always on the hunt for new coins with solid potential. Like, deep-diving whitepapers, checking dev activity, stalking communities, it's lowkey a hobby at this point. I live for those hidden plays that could 5x or even 10x in the next bull run.

I love my clients and their pets. 

But y'all, I'm tired. 

I work 40-45 hours a week at my main job and use Rover to pay off debt faster/for fun money. Recently, I took a promotion at my main job which requires more of me even though I'm still able to set my own schedule and can take meetings and calls from my phone wherever. Most of my days now look like getting up at 7, getting coffee, hitting one or more clients then going home at 9:30 to work for 3-4 hours then hitting clients again for an hour or two while taking meetings from my phone then working 3-4 more hours before making dinner at 6:30 and trying to sit down for a minute until I have to hit my end of night clients between 8:30-9:30. Weekends are nearly as bad with my day chopped into segments around clients. I'm at the point where I rarely accept overnight clients without multiple months notice due to adding extra chaos to my already busy schedule.

Since the promotion, my days feel like I'm never ever able to relax because every few hours I'm back at it. I rarely have a day off from both jobs. I've upped my rates, turned off accepting new clients, changed my settings to say no middays M-F and that I need more notice for bookings, dropped my drop in slots offerings but then every one of my regulars will book me for the same 2 week period and I feel awful telling them no. I have a couple clients I'd be willing to cut loose (not super attached to them or the pets in a neutral way, no ill will, they're just very sporadic and last minute with their bookings) but I need help with 'break up' verbiage. Something like- ""Hey client! Wanted to give you advanced notice that due to an increased work load at my main job, I'm reducing my available number of service slots starting on x date as I'm now required to be at my desk more with less flexibility from 10-4. I'm letting you know now as I won't be able to take extra bookings during the work week once those slots are taken."" for my regulars I'm okay becoming a back up option for in the future but can't keep being a starter.

couple months back i got her a Roomba because i thought, hey, you know what this woman who vacuums like she's preparing our living room for alien autopsy could use? a tiny robot to vacuum FOR her.

this was a mistake.

she did not trust the Roomba. the first time it ran, she followed it around like it was a drunk raccoon loose in the house. she'd make these disgusted little noises every time it failed to suck up an invisible molecule of dust.

but instead of accepting she didn’t like it, i figured she just didn’t give it a chance. so i implicitly took over Roomba duty, running it while she was out, emptying the bin before she sees it.

except.

she reorganized the furniture one day while i was at work, full on feng shui renaissance type beat. and she didn’t tell me. so that night i ran the Roomba on its usual route, unaware that its path now included a coffee table that had been moved half a foot to the left. the Roomba, bless its simple-minded optimism, slammed directly into the new leg and got stuck under the couch, where it panicked and spun in circles, chewing on one of her very favorite fuzzy house socks like it was the last meal on death row.

and then it vomited the chewed-up sock out and immediately tried to eat it again like it had a personal vendetta. the sock was shredded. the Roomba was gagging. my wife walked in.

she took in the scene with a fury so cold you’d instantly die of hypothermia and i looked at her like maybe i could climb inside the Roomba to hide from the consequences of my actions.

i tried to apologize. i tried to explain. but she was holding the sock like it had died in her arms and i had fed it to a blender. she accused me of not respecting her system, choosing convenience over care, and “weaponizing”the Roomba, which sounds way cooler than what actually happened. like i’m out here building a murderbot. all i did was press a button. maybe at a bad time. maybe in a bad room. while not checking for sock-based landmines.

anyway she’s mad. she says she can’t trust me OR the Roomba anymore, and she also made me swear to never run the Roomba again unsupervised, which feels like a demotion from Idiot Husband to Lowly Intern.

so.

AITA for causing the sockpocalypse and apparently betraying my wife via vacuum-based proxy warfare?

These aren't complicated barista secrets, just overlooked details that make a remarkable difference.



Have you tried:

\- Resting your beans 5-7 days after roast date before brewing?

\- Pre-heating not just your mug but all your brewing equipment?

\- Using filtered water at precisely 200°F for most methods?

\- Timing your bloom phase to exactly 30-45 seconds?

\- Cleaning your grinder weekly (yes, weekly!) to remove oils?



My morning brew improved dramatically after implementing these small changes. The difference between good coffee and exceptional coffee often lies in these subtle details we overlook.

Book 3  of 'Divorced Now What?'  
  
Third POV  
  
Life has moved along at a swift pace. Life has been good and peaceful.  
  
The royals had relaxed their guard since no unexplained deaths or murders or kidnappings had occurred. Life had been exciting, and they all enjoyed the peace and watching the children grow up and bond as one huge family.  
  
So have Jacko and Hank, Bethany, and Theo. Their lives around the orphanages and Danny's successful racing career kept them busy.  
  
Only Scott still had eyes and ears around the world watching for trouble. His Dad told him to always be on the watch, not just for the missing but for other problems as well. Scott's company had grown to a global size, having men in every country that he could, his men and women all well-trained and ex-service service. If someone is dirty, they will find them. Scott's level of security was on the verge of paranoia, but he would not relax his vigilance. His Dad said never to give up, even when you think all is good or you have lost everything, never give up. Deep down, he knew he had missed someone, and sooner or later, they would show their hand, and he was as ready as he could be. A person could only catch a plane, train, or passenger liner with his face recognition program checking them all out. Only private planes and ships could bypass his security. There was little he could do about that. He could not get permits to put it in private marinas or airports and didn't even start on helipads.  
  
It is a good thing that Scott had.   
  
However, the program only includes known criminals or suspects, so any new face would not be considered a criminal. Scott cannot keep up with all the associates of criminals, no matter how good he is.  
  
A person who is aware of the past and has a score to settle or believes they have a score to settle is gearing up to take over Bethany and Theo's city. This syndicate has tried before and not succeeded, but now it is ready to try again. Small groups have been moving over there in the last few years, setting up a base and preparing to take what they believe is theirs.   
  
The word on the streets scares the local homeless, who are grouped together in places far away from their usual camping spots. They hope to survive by staying close to each other.   
  
Even the local police need to be made aware of the gathering or the problems that will soon arise.  
  
Bob POV  
  
'Come on, Pam, they are young and starting to want more. You can't blame the boys for being a little rougher now that they are older.' I defended the lads. Pam stands with her hands on her hips, looking at the three boys angrily. Alex had a black eye, Axil a busted lip, and Austin had bruising but nothing major. Their clothes have tears in them and are filthy. They had been in the tunnels mucking around, and it got out of hand, as it often does with three teenage boys. They are stronger than they realize and can do each other damage, but not on purpose. It is just at that age.  
  
'Stop defending them, and they should know better by now. They are not babies anymore.'  
  
'No, they are not. They are three boys going through puberty. You are lucky they are fighting each other and not out bedding every girl that gives them the eye,' I growled back in frustration. If I had mentioned I had been through this before with Thomas, I would never have heard the end of it; I learned that lesson a few years ago.  
  
'They would not dare; they are not old enough.' She gasped in shock at my words and stared at the boys as if assessing how true they were.  
  
'No, they are not; as you said, they are not babies any longer, and they have those needs too, mostly likely using the hand at the moment, but sooner or later, they will experiment, and there is nothing you or I can do about that, except to teach them how to be safe.' I looked at the boys, who were so shocked that I had said such a thing to their mother. I had that talk with them a few years ago, and last year, I gave them all a box of condoms and said if you have to be nice to the girl and, don't break their hearts. They were still too young to understand what I meant at the time, other than how to use condoms; broken hearts were something new to them, as they had never had a girlfriend that I knew about.  
  
'Boys, do you have girlfriends?' Pam asked, and I was not sure if the boys would tell her if they had, not yet anyway; she had no clue how to be with the boys now; they were growing so fast that she was lost in how to treat them. They are all six feet four and still growing; they are my height, and I feel they will pass me soon. They are adults to look at, with a baby face and no real facial hair yet, but I can see telltale signs it won't be long, and I will be teaching them how to shave. They have little bits of fluff, but not enough to go full-blown shaving. They have chest hair, a lot of it, and under the arms, like most men, but the face only has bits and pieces, and what makes me laugh is that all three are exactly the same: the same chest hair and facial hair. It is uncanny how exact they are to look at. I can tell them apart, and so can Pam and all her siblings, meaning Bethany's children; and funny enough, Scott's three girls can tell them apart, yet his two sons still have moments where they get confused.   
  
'We have some girls we are interested in but have not ventured to ask them to date us yet. I personally do not feel I am ready. I like the company as I have it now and am worried if I should ask her to date me. It might hurt the friendship we already have.' Alex replied, the only girls I know they hang around with other than Bethany's girls and Jacko's and Hanks, whom I doubt would be who they are talking about, are Scott's three daughters, and I know all three get along with them well. Could it be Scott's girls? Please don't ask who. I think to myself as I watch Pam process what they have said. Pam was never one to rush to a conclusion but could be emotional regarding her boys.  
  
'Anyone I know?' She asked coyly.  
  
'Don't answer that, boys, if you know what is good for you.' I said, looking at Pam with a big grin. If she had yet to work it out, it would be her problem. I had not heard them once talk about a girl from school, so it had to be them, and I could not have been happier if that was the case.  
  
'But.' She tried to complain.  
  
'Leave the boys to sort out their own love life; they are young, and as long as they keep it either in their pants or use protection, I will wait till they are ready, and so should you.' I watched the boy's faces and could see they were happy with my intervention, and I am not sure if they are ready to admit who it is they like a lot, let alone tell their parents. When they are ready to bring them to us as a possible candidate as girlfriend material, then I will believe it. My boys are sensitive like Thomas was at that age, but then he had more to deal with, liking both girls and guys, it must have been a struggle till he found his own solution.  
  


# Chapter 2

Alex POV  
  
Two days later and what happened when we got grounded for a week for getting busted up a little, was still grating on all three of us, we wanted to have fun, but each time we did, we ended up grounded or had privileges removed.  
  
Mum really knows how to embarrass a guy; she went from full-blown anger about a fat lip and black eye to wanting to know who we liked in about two seconds flat. I am so glad Dad understood and stopped Mum from embarrassing me, or should I say, us any further. If she had even a clue who we were interested in, we would suddenly have them over for dinner and other events until they would be sick of us so fast. We see them every day already. We do not need Mum to push them onto us any further. Besides, they are younger than us; one is two years younger, and the twins are three years younger, so at thirteen and fourteen, they are too young for us to consider dating yet. But they are beginning to look absolutely beautiful as their bodies grow into womanhood. All of us have noticed the subtle changes that had begun a little while ago.  
  
We were playing in the tunnels and having some fun, and yeah, maybe it is not a good appearance to be sporting a black eye, a cut lip, or torn clothes, but what can we do? Mum has us on such a tight reign, and I understand the GPS on us. Scott explained it clearly to us when we got old enough to understand what it all meant, especially with the loss of Grandpa and Grandma and uncles. I get it, WE get it. But Mum has to let us have our time. I need to be able to muck around with my brother and let off steam; it gets suffocating.  
  
I hate being a prince. I want to be a regular guy, doing everyday things; no matter how much we are told about how lucky we are by our friends, we do not see it. They don't get it, the pressure Mother puts on us to look the part, act it, and be whatever. I get so angry at times I want to scream. If it were not for my two brothers, I would have gone insane by now. We all feel the same way, and dressing the same at events and parties sucks. Don't we look alike enough without making the dress code the same? It is fun sometimes when adults get us confused, like at school, the teacher gets us wrong all the time, and most kids do too, which can be fun sometimes. Still, as we have gotten older, it is less fun and more annoying, especially when we try to look at getting a girlfriend our age, and none of the girls can tell us apart. We all spent a day with the same girl, and she had no clue.  
  
What drives the teachers insane is that we are so alike that our school records are almost identical. We get the same questions wrong, and so our scores are the same: ninety-eight percent. I am slightly better at football than my brothers, Austin is better at swimming, and Axel likes to read a lot, but the difference in sports is marginal, not enough to point us out on the field or in the pool. If one starts to get too far ahead, he pulls back and lets us catch up, and if I win one meeting, one of the others will win the next, just so we all get a turn to win.   
  
In a way, it is our fault that no one can tell us apart. Except for our family and the Scott's girls, we do so much the same.   
  
We have the same taste; none of us like sugar in our coffee or tea, we don't like eggs, and we have all had measles at the same time. We like our hair the same way, and the clothes fit us the same way, like the same color. All three of us have deep baritone voices that girls seem to love hearing, and we can sing, but we prefer not to.   
  
Mum said we are all one person, not three boys, because we came from the same egg. We get it and understand why we are identical, but we are still three individual people. It makes it easy when Mum orders us new shoes or clothes. She not once thought about putting us in different colors or making us stand out as individuals; she cloned us to be the same since we were born. But she sees us as one child and not three, and each has our own needs and wants.   
  
Thank goodness Dad sees us as three sons and treats us accordingly, always giving us love and support, chatting as we get older, giving us the chat, and treating us as growing adults, not children. He shows us that he trusts us. I loved it when he had time to run with us in the tunnels, and Scott and the king joined in, along with Scott's two boys. The girls only join in when they are just kids, and they love the tunnels and the games as we do; they have good sword skills now and can land a hit on me when they gang us together.   
  
'Alex, have you decided yet?' Axel asked in a tone that said they were going, whether I joined in or not.  
  
'I don't mind going to that party, but I refuse to take off the GPS. You know it is for our safety.' I say again that I have had this argument with him repeatedly. I am breaking Dad's trust in us by taking it off.   
  
'But that is half the fun; no one else wears them.' He counters back in a whiny, baritone voice that sounds rather funny.  
  
'They are not princes.'   
  
'You are no fun. Where is the risk-taker gone?'  He almost snarls at me. His frustration with being grounded is as hard on him as it is on the rest of us.  
  
'I am not going to end the story, but I am not stopping you from breaking Dad's trust.' The look of doubt flashed on his face. If we are complaining about how bad we have it now, wait till she finds out that two of her boys are considering breaking the hardest rule of all.   
  
'We are leaving at eight after dinner tonight. Stay here and be a wimp.' They left my room, and I returned to doing my homework. I wanted to finish this, so I had the whole Sunday to enjoy myself. Dad said we could do some stuff together, and if we were lucky enough, and I got up early enough on Sunday, we would try to connect with the family and watch their final game with them. I am excited about doing that. I am into sports as much as Dad is, and I love it when we can spend a day with the family; it is harder for Dad; our time zones clash, and Dad works too hard. But the final is later in their day, so not so early in ours. It started around seven in the morning, so if I could get ready by six, we could have breakfast together in the games room and chat with the family before the game. It is rare to have a day with Dad like this.  
  
Saturday flew by. My homework was done, and I had a shirt picked out for the morning. Dad and I had matching shirts. I think I am starting to get taller than him now. He is six feet four inches, and I think I am now half an inch taller, but I won't tell him that; he said we had a few more years of growing and could hit six feet six or more.  
  
Dinner was a hive of chatter. Dad had told Mum we were having a game day with the rest of the family tomorrow, and she begged off, saying she would rather sleep in. She loves the sport and knows it is the final, but she has some function to go to at lunchtime, and she needs her beauty sleep before getting up to face all those cameras. Even Mum does not like the royal duties, which are so time-consuming, always having to smile when you don't feel like it. I have to take my hat off to my mum; she takes her job seriously, and that is how we see this royal duties stuff. The only difference is that you never get to clock off and be you for long.  
  
Axel put his head in the door to my room and looked around.  
  
'You not coming?' He looked disappointed at my reluctance.  
  
'Nope.' I was not going to go out against Mum and Dad; we may be the same in every way, but this one, I am not a goodie-two-shoes, as he puts it. But I do not wish to break the trust Dad has in us.  
  
Not in this way.  
  


# Chapter 3

Axel POV  
  
My brother Alex never likes to take the bigger risks; he spouts out about trust issues, and if we lose Dad or Mum's trust, it will make our lives harder. I don't get it myself. Is that not what being a teenager is all about taking risks and enjoying life while you can? I want to party hard and enjoy life while I am young and can do it. Once we take on the royal duties, our life will suck, just like Dad's does. He might not know. I see how it drains his life, but I can. I don't want a life like that. I know he is getting old and has not had it easy, and he had lots to learn when he married Mum, but he overdoes things all the time, trying to balance time with us and the royal duties and giving Mother some time, too. I want a life and not to be shackled with royal responsibilities yet. I am young and free for a bit longer and will enjoy it.  
  
Tonight, after dinner, I am sneaking out with Austin. We are going to a party. It is a girl's sixteenth, and I like this girl. She isn't my girlfriend, and I doubt she ever would, but she is free with her love, and I have condoms. Thanks to Dad, he gave us the birds and the bees chat and showed us how to put one on—don't ask how—just that he did. Anyway, she will be my first. She asked if I would come and the present she wanted was me for a quickie. I did not tell her I had never been with a girl before. I have seen enough p\*\*n to know how it works; she is not a virgin, and she will most likely teach me more than I will her. That was why I was pushing to go today. She will have Austin, too; it will be our first time, and she is more than willing to spread her legs for any guy tonight. Her folks were away, and she had the house all to herself and was throwing a big party; everyone was invited from school, and that was in her class, as were a few older guys.  
  
Dinner was boring and seemed to take forever. Because I was in a hurry to leave, one of the guys who lived not too far from us would meet us down the road and drive us to the place. I almost messed it up when I failed to pay attention when Mother was talking, and Austin had to nudge me under the table to bring me back to the conversation.  
  
'Sorry Mum was not listening, what did you say?' I tried to play it cool.  
  
'What was on your mind that has you so preoccupied?' She asked, a deep form marred her pretty face.  
  
'We have a math test on Friday, and I am having trouble with a few statistical methods; there is more than one way to do them, and I feel I get them a little mixed up.' Mum will fall for it every day; if it is school-related, she forgives us quickly.  
  
'Get Austin to help you then; he is good at statistics.' She continued with whatever she talked about, and I tried to pay more attention than last time.  
  
When the meal was done, and we had sat long enough to satisfy the folks that we had given them enough of our family time, I stood up.  
  
'Austin, can you come with me and help me with my math?' I asked coyly. Mother nodded, happy thinking we were off to do our homework. Alex knew what was going on but did not say a word. I would have been disappointed if he had, but he said that he would not mention it unless asked. Glad he was keeping his word, as we left the room, I turned to look at him as I reached the doorway before disappearing out of sight. He nodded and turned back to the conversation going on at the table, something about a sports day tomorrow.  
  
Austin and I rushed to my room, removed our pendants, and changed. We moved to the secret doorway, and thanks to all the years, Dad, Uncle Albert, and Uncle Scott played with us in there. We knew every tunnel by heart. We did not even need to turn the strip lights on to show the way; I knew every inch in the dark. Carefully, we took off down the hallways, into the tunnels, and out across the garden. I knew where the sensors were and how to avoid them. We both dropped low as we passed one and jumped over another and dodged a few motion cameras, then located the gap we made in the fence last week when we were planning to go to this party and slid through, making sure to put the railing back, making it look solid.  
  
We started to walk towards the city when a car flashed its lights at us, and we took off at a faster speed toward the car.  
  
'Hi Roger,' Austin said as we climbed into the back. A girl I had never met before sat in the front. She was cute.   
  
'Hi, this is Anita. This is Austin and Axel.' I nodded at her, and Austin, I think, blushed, which made her giggle.  
  
They took us to an area we had never been to before, and we heard the music beat when we turned into a street and pulled up outside a large house with people everywhere, the noise so loud I could hardly hear Roger say this was it. Austin and I followed Roger. He had his arms around this girl's waist and was walking at a good speed to the house.  
  
I looked at Austin, who had a massive grin on his face, his eyes looking around at all the gorgeous girls dancing to the booming music of the house. There was a mess everywhere: empty bottles and red cups dropped on the lawn. I would not want to be the one cleaning this up tomorrow, but a girl came rushing out of the house, laughing and wearing nothing but her stiletto shoes. I knew we had made the right choice to come tonight. This place was rocking and would be the talk at school on Monday.  
  
Roger called us into the house, and through the crowd of people, the place was so jam-packed that you could hardly move, some grinding against each other, and others, full-on tongues down the throat and hands up the dresses. This was a wild scene, nothing like we had ever been to before.   
  
If only Mum could see us now.  
  
A goddess walked up to us, kissed Austin full on the mouth, and took his hand, leading him away from me. His eyes were glued to her scanty-clad body, and he followed eagerly. I hope he remembers to put a cover on it. He never once looked back at me to make sure I was okay. I chuckled as he disappeared up the stairs to what I assumed would be a bedroom.  
  
'Let's find Massey, the birthday girl.' I followed Roger, my head looking around the place, at that same time trying not to look like this was the first time I had been to a party like that. The girl who was the center of attention turned when Roger called out her name, and her eyes widened when she saw me. She virtually ran up to me and jumped up, and I suddenly had this girl plastered onto me like a baby to her mother; I wrapped my arms around her, my hands on her bottom, holding her to me as she covered me with kisses. I was so shocked at this unexpected situation. I thought I would have to work my way up to asking her to take me to bed, but it seems that Austin and I are the meal of the night.  
  
'Want to do it?' She asked, her voice soft and inviting. I hope she meant what I was hoping she meant.  
  
The girl untangled herself from me and took my hand, leading me to the stairs Austin had just disappeared from earlier.  
  
The room she led me to was almost at the end of the hallway. When we entered, it smelt just like her; she walked me to her bed and turned to me, and started to remove my shirt; when that hit the floor, she kissed my chest and rubbed her perky t\*\*s against me; I was hard as a rock in an instant.  
  
'Someone is glad to see me.' She said as she cupped my balls in her hand and gently squeezed them, and I almost embarrassed myself in my pants. I had never had this done to me before, and I was out of my depth here.   
  
She dropped to her knees and started to undo my trousers, pulling them down to my knees and looking at my erection.  
  
'They were right, you are huge. I am going to enjoy this.' she placed her mouth over my hardness and sucked and licked and nipped at it.  
  
'If you do not want me to make a mess in your mouth, you had better stop.' I moaned at her.  
  
She pulled away and looked up at me with a huge grin. She removed her clothes and then finished stripping me. Pulled me to bed.  
  
'Stop.' I commanded, and she looked up at me, all hurt.  
  
'I need to cover it first.' She smiled and put out her hand, asking for the condom. I obliged; she did the honors, expertly removed it from its wrappings, and slid it onto me. The sensation was bliss, and I was worried about how long I could last and whether I would be satisfied.  
  
Then she lay on the bed and crooked her finger at me, calling me to her. I smirked and crawled onto the bed, kissing her body on my way up the bed till I was hovering over her. It was time to have my first experience, and when I was done and had my fill of wanton ladies, the one I really wanted would be old enough for me to approach.",1,1746595283.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Kaya Pala T@e ang argumento ng mga Bagong Lublob. Naanib pala sila sa Food Baiting ng MCGI ni Daniel Razon

Once upon a time, the so-called “kapatiran” of Ang Dating Daan were infamous for their sharp tongues, airtight doctrinal arguments, and a kind of cult-bred intellectual elitism. Forums like “The Bereans” and early Facebook comment wars were battlegrounds. 

Active MCGI members were trained not just to recite verses but to defend them tooth and nail. Agree or not, you couldn’t deny they were sharp.

Today? Mga bagong lublob, sabaw. Shallow arguments. Mema takes. Panay copy-paste ng insulto like “b0b0,” “kita-kits sa finals”, “inggit pikit”

Gone are the days of reasoned defense. What replaced it? Lugaw at makapal na Lumpia Wrapper.

From doctrine to Dog show este Game show.

According to a recent thread on r/MCGIExiters, there’s a visible downgrade in the cognitive depth of the newer recruits. The old era of critical debate has been replaced by a culture of shallow allegiance, many of whom were reportedly lured through free meals, charismatic emceeing, and spectacle-based events.

Instead of being convicted by rigorous Bible study, most are being guilt-tripped after accepting a plate of fried chicken. “Kasalanan pag hindi sila umanib,” they’re told. “Baka kung anong mangyari sa kanila.”

The Fast-Food Evangelism of Kuya Daniel Razon

Under the Eli Soriano era, there were a series of bible expo and grand pulong that precedes every mass indoctrination.

Now, under Daniel Razon, di pa na-itata3 ang lugaw iniimbita na kaagad sa doktrina!

This is the reason why MCGI’s Mass Indoctrinations are flopping. Recent reports show two straight sessions with zero visitors. The result? Leaders are instructing members to revisit old invites and instill fear like “Nakaalam na sila ng katotohanan. Kasalanan pag hindi umanib.”

Spiritual Fast Food Yields Fast-Failing Faith

When your members were converted via lugaw, don’t expect them to debate like theologians. You traded literacy for loyalty, and now you’re stuck with a generation of followers who can’t tell 1 John from John 1. And when challenged, all they can do is call you names or worse, tag LOBO.

That’s why many ex-members today mourn not just the abuse, but the intellectual decline.

Ang aming panawagan

When this happens to the inside of my electric kettle (or other cookingware, etc.) I just make a vinegar solution from 5% distilled vinegar and DI water (the concentration doesn't matter very much), heat it to boiling, and then pour it into the object I am trying to descale. Sometimes this works almost instantly.

**My dad called me fat on my birthday and said I should start working on “loosing the baby weight”**



Like the title says, my dad called me fat on my birthday and told me I should start working on shedding the baby weight. I am writing in for any advice on how to talk to him about this. I am also sorry about the length.

For a little background information: I (27f) and my husband (25m) welcomed our first baby this past June via C section. We are both full time music teachers, I teach high school choir at one of the biggest AA high schools in our state and he teaches elementary band at 7 elementary schools. Along with all of our concerts, choir tour, festivals, and all the rest of the stuff that comes with being a teacher we also teach private lessons on the side to help with the low pay of our jobs and the current state of our economy. So any spare time we have we make sure to spend it as a family with our son.

Now to the title. I just celebrated my birthday yesterday and my dad was in town to help with our home renovations and to celebrate with us. On the morning of my birthday I was sitting enjoying a cup of coffee with my husband and son and opening gifts. No more than 5 minutes into the gift opening my dad comes in and sits down infront of us saying “bare with me, I need to break into dad mode for a second” and then goes off about his own weight. Haveing heard this many times before, he’s been insecure about his dad bod for as long as I can remember and constantly brings it up, I just nodded along.

Until he starting talking about us. He would say things like “ya know I’m an old man that’s overweight but you two are young and over weight you’ll have an easier time loosing weight, you don’t want to be the heaviest in the family” I was FLOORED and had no clue how to even respond. Continuing on he goes “if we all just took the summer to focus on getting skinny we could all keep each other accountable” and then he turns to my husband and says “you know you’re just like me the family fluff” and then turns to me and says “and if you want to have more kids it’ll be much harder to shed off that baby weight.”

At this point I was fighting back tears. I have always had an amazing relationship with my dad even with the constant weight comments, in High-school he would always say things like “if you just lost 5 more pounds you would be a perfect size.” Mind you I am just over 6’ and in High-school was at an unhealthy weight due to comments like this and severe body dysmorphia, but after years of therapy I was finally feeling comfortable in my body, especially after going through pregnancy and having a C-section. After his baby weight comment he digressed and said “I don’t mean to hurt feelings and your older sister told me to mind my own business but I have a preposition for you both, I’ll pay for you to go on weight watchers.

Now you can either think on it and say yes or I’ll go back out the garage and you can tell me to fuck off behind my back. What ever works” and then he got up and left. Once he was out the door I started crying and my husband held me close. He did end up coming back in, seeing me cry, and apologized for hurting my feelings. Like I said previously I am very tall and have always felt I carried my weight pretty well, but with work and a baby I haven’t had a whole lot of time to work out but his comments still hurt.

Here’s where I need advice. How do I approach telling him that his comments were uncalled for and I don’t want to be focusing so much on appearance for the sake of my son and his mental health as he gets older. I adore my dad and don’t want this conversation to be aggressive but I’m not great at setting boundaries. I grew up in a divorced family that avoided conflict and had terrible communication skills on both sides. So I’m still learning to communicate my feelings with my family. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.

*You need to be FIRM with dad.*

*Tell him it was inappropriate to talk about your weight when you were a child and it’s still inappropriate now that you’re an adult.*

*Tell him that if he mentions his, your, your husband’s, or anyone else’s weight around you again that you’ll be taking a break from him for 6 mos.*

*Then tell him that he has a distorted view on weight and health and that he needs to see a professional about it.*

*Sorry, hun. You’re going to have to get real firm. It’s time.*

**Forsaken-Photo4881**

*You need to be completely honest. He may have come from a concerned place. Although he handled it badly and also on your birthday. You love your dad. Anyone telling you to cut him off are just ridiculous. I would write him a letter with your feelings about it all. That way nothing gets missed and emotions don’t get high. Write it from a place of love which is where he was coming from even though he sucked at the way he handled it.*

>OOP: Thank you for the great advice. I do think he’s coming from a place of love and concern. I think he’s worried that I’ll get to a point where he’s at both physically and mentally. He has expressed similar things to my sisters but never on their birthday. Going no contact is not an option for me. Other than the weight thing he is truly an amazing dad-very supportive and loving. I

**rowsella**

*I think you just need to tell him that you love him just the way he is (physically) and that you never want him to address your weight/food intake ever again. He just needs to accept and love you the way you are too. He can feel/think whatever he wants to but this is not a subject you are willing to discuss.*

**Forsaken-Photo4881**

*You are so blessed to have such an amazing dad. Not everyone is that fortunate.*

>OOP: He truly is. And I know he be super receptive and apologetic. Just the radio silence from him right now makes me feel like he is already regretting what he said. I still need to chat with him about not bringing that up again especially for my son’s sake.



**Update - 2 days later**



Thank you to everyone for the advice on the topic! After reading through many helpful comments, I was able to compile some great advice and call my dad.

Here’s a run down of how the conversation went:

Me: “hey dad I hope that you’re doing well. I was hoping we could chat about the conversation that happened on my birthday”

Him: “oh yes, thank goodness you’re calling to bring this up. I feel like I shot my self in the foot, I am so sorry.”

Me: “I appreciate your apology and I know what you said came from a place of love. I just wanted to tell you that I have been working really hard to feel comfortable and love my body, especially after the pregnancy and C-Section. Skinny doesn’t necessarily mean healthy and I feel good about my self right now, and I want to set a good example for my son and make sure he grows up in an environment where we have a healthy mind set about our bodies”

Him: I’m so glad that you feel comfortable and you love your body, that is what’s the most important. In such an idiot for bringing it up. Sometimes we say things at parents that we mean to come off a different way and I totally messed up. Thank you so much for calling me and chatting about it. I feel as if a weight has been lifted off my back, I’ve been thinking about what I said all weekend. I love you so much”

And then we went on about our days. Thank you for all the help guys.

*Wow, communication that worked! Well done, I'm sure that conversation wasn't easy for you. I'm glad it all worked out. I'm a fan of loving ourselves as we are and working to improve in a healthy way. I constantly tell people we didn't get to where we are overnight and changes won't come overnight. Long term and sustainable changes are good.*

He said he wasn’t expecting the proposition, and he wasn’t down coz he just wanted to be lazy and stay home and rest. Which, fair enough. It’s been a rough week. 

He didn’t bother rescheduling or texting after, which. I’m just thinking maybe I misread the whole thing. Maybe he just wanted to be friends the whole time.

Now I’m trying to get over something that never was, I guess. I feel a bit silly about immediately liking the first person who’s nice to me, haha. But I want someone to be Unwell about me the way I’d be Unwell about them, yk? 

Like, I’m trying to let the idea of us go while still being friends with him, and it’s hard coz he’s cute and he obviously doesn’t care about me as anything more than a friend. Yippee.

Here’s my story: slept in the basement where the mold was for about a week and woke up one morning, not being able to eat anything.

I started to notice that ground beef is the only thing that I could eat without getting severe pain in my gut.

Sidenote: my parents, which I understand didn’t believe me and thought I was making it up in my head.

I luckily read Judy chois book ..a year before so I read it again and started doing the carivore diet for about seven months on and off… it’s fucking hard and it sucks but it makes you feel better. After about seven months of doing it, I started being able to tolerate more foods like certain fruits and vegetables low amylose foods.

Every now and again I would eat candy or grains and immediately have a flare up that would cause horrible gut pain for a couple days and inflammation in my knees and back

After spending around $3000 with Judy Choi In 2024 I started taking binders October 2024

I took CSM powderfor a couple weeks and then quit and just decided to not think about the mold illness at all and see if I can heal by trying to eat gluten-free which was half a huge mistake and the other half of it was good because I really started to focus on my mental health, which is a huge part of healing.

Focusing too much on I have this. I have that I eat this. I get back Pain or I eat this and I get gut pain.

A lot of this stuff is beliefs . You believe you have something you will have it. I know it’s a crazy idea, but it’s true.

Now fast-forward 2025….. I started taking CSM pills which is a lot easier to take in then powder and I have been consistent with it for two months now, and have been focusing majority of my meals on eating 1 pound of beef a day with lots of different kinds of lettuce…

I’ve noticed major improvements with my mood, my gut and the inflammation.

A few times I’ve tested to see if I can handle drinking a beer or pasta or dried fruit and I’m immediately reminded that I can’t yet and I’ll get gut pain immediately and inflammation in my lower back and knees, and my mood will completely change and I’ll start having crazy thoughts about feeling like shit….

I have noticed that I can handle potato chips, which is now my favorite snack... but only the ones that have potatoes, salt and oil. I used to be anti seed oils but they haven't been effecting me with the chips .. I do go for air fried ones tho ...and sometimes the ones that have olive in them but haven't been too picky 

I also cut out coffee, which was very hard until I started to replace my coffee addiction with a nicotine pouch addiction, which is not as addicting as coffee I must say. I know I know you will prolly say what?? Nicotine is SOOO ADDICTIVE but I haven't experienced that have been taking them for 2 months and I've had over 100 pouches and have stopped cold turkey a few times and have had no withdrawals. Vs if when I stopped drinking coffee cold turkey I'd get headaches or trying to quick Kane sugar I'd drive myself to the convenient store at 11pm just to get candy... nicotine doesn't make you do that .... my experience thooo

I tend to have one pouch in the morning like I’m having a cup of coffee and then I’ll have one throughout the day and then one before I go to bed. And helps with cravings and it makes me feel good.

I’m two years into recovering and I can finally see the end.

If you’re in the beginning of your journey or still in the middle, keep fighting stay positive and get some help from a mold expert like Judy Choi nutrition with Judy. 

Her team has helped me stay accountable. 

Now my focus right now is just to continue eating 1 pound of beef a day with a big salad , nicotine as a supplement, fish oil pills , daily exercise and positive thoughts… taking my binders and pooping everyday.

Like, religiously.

A little payday? Straight to my portfolio. Got a bonus? That’s going into some altcoin I’ve been stalking for days. I’ll pass on the steak dinner if it means I can buy the dip. I’m not even ashamed,I'm literally addicted to the idea of gains.

It’s not even about getting rich quick (okay maybe a little), but there's just something so thrilling about watching your money grow while others blow theirs on stuff they won’t even remember next week. Some call it risky. I call it calculated. I’d rather miss out on a shopping haul than miss a breakout.

And honestly? I’m just thinking long-term. I don’t want to be working ‘til I’m 60, barely surviving on some pension. I want to retire early, chill hard, and live life on my own terms. Like imagine waking up with no alarms, sipping coffee while watching your portfolio do its thing. That’s the dream tbh.

I’m also always on the hunt for new coins with solid potential. Like, deep-diving whitepapers, checking dev activity, stalking communities, it's lowkey a hobby at this point. I live for those hidden plays that could 5x or even 10x in the next bull run.

1kgpac2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_julylifecoach/comments/1kgpac2/beyond_im_doing_well/,"Beyond ""I'm doing well""","I’m talking to my students about how to write specifically about problems they solve. “I help you live a happy life” as a description for my work is more or less appropriate. But that’s such a general and vague statement. “Finish your to do list today with my excitement-based anti-procrastination program” is a super specific way of talking about my book Action Formula and I’d say finishing a to do list feels amazing, so that sounds enticing.

This isn’t exclusively a business related skill to develop, I think it helps in general social interactions too. When we want to advance our social relationships from the “hey, how are you doing?” “I’m doing well, how about you?” “I’m also doing well. Thanks.” to “Hey!!! How is it going???” “Oh my god, I have so much to tell you — do you have a few minutes? Wanna grab coffee?”, what are the steps involved in that?

When we think about our formal, cordial relationships, there’s a certain kind of a distance to it. Yes, we exchange smiles and the vibes are generally good but it’s good *at a distance*. There’s an implicit rule that says the distance has to be kept for a cordial relationship.

Getting into a deeper relationship means that the distance will be broken. In the best case this will be a good thing and we’ll have deeper relationships with people but unfortunately life doesn’t always give you the best case scenarios. In the worst case people will find the lack of distance off-putting or offensive and choose to leave the relationship with you.

Are we willing to take that risk?

When you tell a specific story to teach a specific lesson to your audience, you’re putting yourself at the risk of being misunderstood. In this day and age, a simple statement of “I like A” is often times misconstrued as “fuck B”. Specificity is like a double edged sword; it has a strong pull when it hits the right way, and it repels when it doesn’t hit.

When you tell someone about your weekend in more depth than usual in your Monday water cooler talk, you’re at the risk of boring the other person or them judging you for your activities. Sharing more about yourself, your personal life — it’s like a double edged sword; it has a strong pull when it hits the right way, and it repels when it doesn’t hit.

But here’s the cool part: nobody said we can only tell one story.

Yes, telling one story carries that risk. But what if you tell another story that explains the misunderstanding? That new story will come with its own set of potential misunderstandings, but what if you told one more story that addresses that? As you continue to share more and more specific stories with individual risks, the more of a collective story you tell.

Sharing one weekend story might but won’t realistically change a relationship dramatically. But throughout the week as you share more and more of yourself, you’ll find yourself closer to your coworkers after that week. It doesn’t have to be about work; if you go to a gym and you have some people who spot you, you can do the same with them. You don’t *have* to be friends with everybody, but your willingness and ability to open yourself up at will can be a great asset in your life.

So today I’ll end with a story that might not resonate with you at all. I trained with a guy I haven’t trained with at my jiu jitsu academy today. His specialty was darce chokes and holy crap, I got choked out so many times I felt a little out of my body on the drive back home today. I thought to myself, “did I actually train today?”. It was very fever dreamish, which I like (don’t worry, I didn’t lose consciousness. Or maybe I did, and this writing is a fever dream?).",1,1746594017.0,u_julylifecoach,0,1.0,False

In January, I spilled a coffee tumbler on it. I had the choice between getting a new MacBook or going with an iPad with a connectable keyboard. Given that I’ve already had two spill incidents, I thought that the iPad with the keyboard would be best to prevent another expensive trip to the Apple Store. I’ve had iPhones for 12 years so I know my way around the software enough to think that this was a fine choice. I mainly used my computer for schoolwork. 
Three months later…I think I hate my iPad. I frequently use Microsoft Word and the controls (or lack thereof) drive me NUTS! I want my MacBook back. The problem is, I’m obviously way past the return window. What I’m asking: am I the problem? Do I need to adjust my expectations? I feel like the iPad is glitchy when it comes to typing (I have a Logitech keyboard) and frequently slows me down. How do I make this tech more like my MacBook? Is that even possible? I need some validation and some advice. ",0,1746593971.0,ipad,9,0.5,False

Basically her son passed away last year and she was evicted during the same time period. She had no where to go so her and her 3 kids moved in with me and my 2 kids. I only have a small 2 bdrm townhouse but she was in a rough spot. 

Fast forward a year later and she’s still living with me,  hasn’t been working the entire time, I pay for everything including rent, bills, food, etc… I have even paid for vaca, clothes and more. I did all this out of the kindness of my heart and it felt good. However, it’s been putting a lot of stress on me lately and I’ve been begging her to help by getting a job and pay for some of the expenses. She says she trying to get a job but I don’t see the effort. This has led to us arguing a lot lately. Almost daily. Sometimes they get so intense she cries and I tell her I can’t do this anymore and she needs to move out. We eventually make up and repeat. It’s become so toxic. I try to sympathize for her lost child but the frustration of not having help overpowers it.

Anyways. I found out today that she went behind my back and met with my ex wife to get her point of view of me. Obviously she’s my ex for a reason and has nothing nice to say about me. She told her I have anger problems, amongst other personal things. On top of that my current gf told my ex wife she found dick pics on my phone. Like that shit is so personal I don’t want my ex to know that. And to be fair, those were because my dick looked good and I was going to send it to my gf and decided not to. Now somehow that has become evidence of me cheating even though I never have. Can a guy not have a dick pic of his own cock? 

So anyways, I am about to leave her permanently for going behind my back and essentially betraying me. Sharing personal information with my ex (which  btw we already don’t get along so I’m sure she loves talking to my gf about me). I’m just so disgusted with her for not asking me first or just talking to literally anyone other than my ex wife. 

What would you do?

TL:DR Been arguing a lot last few months with gf. Been supporting her for over a year while she stays unemployed. She eventually went behind my back and had coffee with my ex wife and shared personal information about me and our relationship without me knowing. ",6,1746593647.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

Belle and Wise can get 300 battery charge every 24 hours, which is how long a full charge takes. Out of that, 240 comes from daily recharge, and the other 60 comes from their free daily coffee from Tin Master. That gives them enough energy to complete 15 bounties, each worth Đ25,000. That adds up to Đ375,000, and with the coffee bonus, their total earnings come to Đ400,000.

Now, it's time to convert this into real money (pre-tax):

* Daily = 400,000 x 0.2 = ¥80,000 or about $558.86
* Monthly = 30 days x $558.86 = $16,765.8 
* Annually = 12 months x $16,765.8 = $201,189.6 

Do note, I'm not familiar with doing taxes so I'll put all my faith and trust in this [site](https://japantaxcalculator.com/):

* 365 days x ¥80,000 = ¥29,200,000

|Income Tax||\-¥7,303,400|
|Resident Tax||\-¥2,487,300|
|Net Income||¥16,112,380|

They make ¥16,112,380 a year, which comes out to about $112,487.16. What makes this stand out is the time it takes. Each run takes around 30 seconds for me. Over a full year, that’s 10,950 seconds—or just over 3 hours. So Belle and Wise are earning $112,487.16 for roughly 3 hours of work, which puts their hourly rate at about $67,063.

I’m still baffled by how poorly everything was handled, especially from an airline that brands itself as one of the world’s best.

**Initial Delay – Stuck on the Plane for 4 Hours**  
After boarding on time and taxiing toward the runway, the captain suddenly announced a technical issue, and we were taken back to the gate. Fair enough—safety first. But instead of letting us disembark, they made us sit *on the aircraft for FOUR HOURS*. No updates, no offers of food or water for ages, and no indication of when we’d actually fly. It was torture. At that point, we could’ve already been in Bangkok if we’d just left on time.

**No Answers, No Clarity**  
Eventually, someone vaguely mentioned that the *next* possible flight might be around 5 a.m. (original departure was 10:30 p.m.). When I asked the cabin crew for help with my onward connection from BKK—*which I booked on a single ticket with Emirates*—the hostess told me Emirates doesn’t fly out of Bangkok (??). I had to insist and push before she contacted a supervisor. No proactive support whatsoever.

**""Compensation""? A Fast Food Voucher.**  
After being held hostage on a grounded plane for hours, we were finally allowed off. What did Emirates give us? A voucher for McDonald’s or Costa Coffee. That’s it. Nothing close to a proper meal or hotel voucher. We got to the gate around 4 a.m., and the ground staff there were outright *rude*. One guy (I think his name was SK) didn’t even look up when we asked for help—just told us to ""complain online.""

**Secondary Delays and More Confusion**  
After going through security again, we waited another 30 minutes before boarding the *new* flight, only to sit inside the plane again for 45 minutes before finally taking off around 5:45 a.m. That’s over 7 hours of delay—*with no support*, *no guidance*, and *no basic courtesy*.

**Missed Connections, Lost Luggage, and Zero Ownership**  
Like many others, I missed my connecting flight. Despite booking a single-ticket itinerary, we were made to exit and recheck in at BKK, going through full immigration again. Just to add insult to injury—they *lost our luggage*. When we asked if they could send it to us later, the staff said that if we left the airport without it, *Emirates would no longer be responsible*. What kind of policy is that?

Even worse, I overheard another passenger who missed their connection due to the same delay—and also lost their hotel booking as a result. When they asked for help, the Emirates staff just asked, “Did you book the hotel with us?” When they said no, the response was basically *“Then it’s not our problem.”*

**Final Straw – Another Worthless Voucher**  
To “compensate” for the entire mess, we were handed a 400 THB food voucher. That’s roughly $10. For a night ruined, a missed flight, lost luggage, and zero communication? What a joke.

  
Emirates completely failed at every level—operations, customer service, crisis management, and basic empathy. DXB is *their hub*, and still the staff were disorganized, dismissive, and even hostile. I’m seriously reconsidering flying with them again, and I’d urge others to think twice before trusting Emirates with tight connections or expecting real support in a crisis.

I wouldn't have an issue if Emirates clearly mentioned that they have 2 offering - Budget and Premium. Not much to expect from a budget airline, but calling yourself Premium and offering such service is a bit much.

Bangalore: finding a PG room was difficult at first, making friends was difficult, because they had clear set of goals from coaching classes, I had same stranger anxiety, the roommate I had got was not of medical field from..., a senior manager of a Coffee company, i felt shy; senior junior..
Then one fine day a Bihari guy, a year or two younger than me, standing 6 feet tall, slim, handsome, came to my room straight from a train from Bihar to work in an enterprise, we both introduced ourselves, he's not so fluent in English, I made him comfortable, asked about the nature of his job, he started to open up, told about his past life, his addiction for a variety of drugs, a chainsmoker, and how he'd to join a rehab for a year in a pathetic condition.

He showed to me his photos -- drugs, his childhood friends, his brother, his girlfriend.

""Do you want lollipop?"", we went to a nearby restaurant in a posh area, we returned to PG in the evening and bought mudde and nonveg from a hotel, had withdrawn 500 from atm and kept in wallet, at night we both went to buy drinks at a bar, paid via online. He said that he'll be going to Mangalore for 3-5 days on work. So we both got drunk, went out for a walk and smoked cigarettes, he asked me ""Do you wanna fuck?"" I was hammered, i just replied
""Hmmm, I like you""
We came back to PG, I was wasted and drunk, he started nudging my butt, and brushing through my beard, grazing my cheeks... such erotic feeling, and we both came close face to face and started kissing, the other roommate had gone out.

**Chapter 18: Train to the Station**

 

Jack sighed. “How slow exactly do we age?”

Lindsay shrugged with one hand. “It’s mild at first and gradually tightens up. By age sixteen and seventeen, it's a year behind and three years at twenty-one. From there, it’s something between thirty and forty percent of what it otherwise would be. So I added seven years, but look like I added only something over two. Arguably. Our life expectancy varies depending on our role, but even the non-combatants are deemed likely to begin getting complications of potentially fatal severity near a century of life, on average. Basically, age will catch up eventually, just not necessarily the way it does with the Franks.”

“Ah. Got it.” *I could be different, but I’m pretty sure Memoria wants that kept very tight-lipped. Not going to risk such a discussion.* “Thanks for being… *frank* with me on the subject.” He grinned shamelessly.

Lindsay rolled her eyes with a sound of disgust. “You clearly need rest. I hope.”

“I can’t argue. My brain needs a reset. Maybe my body, too. So, whatever it is you do, power-wise, would it be better now or later?”

She laid her hands palm-up on the table to either side of the cleaned plate, then wriggled her fingers. “Let me do a quick delve. Just to set the stage and help align my understanding of you more three-dimensionally. We can do the heavier, more specialized stuff tomorrow.”

“Sure thing.” Jack placed his hands over hers, then raised an eyebrow. “Now what?”

“Close your eyes and be generically receptive.”

“While you read my fortune like a Beforetime sorceress? Awesome.” He closed his eyes.

“If your power is your fortune, then yes. But there’s a lot of the present and little of the future in that. We can’t avoid uncertainty. Or choice. Now, shut up and relax. Get more receptive. You’re not being receptive enough!”

“I’m so sorry, Taskmistress Lindsay,” Jack muttered in exaggerated mock obsequiousness. He then tried to do as instructed, taking several deep breaths in an attempt to relax.

He felt a sudden pressure in his head and a pulse or flash behind his eyes. There was the distinct impression of his brain being ‘heated’ or energized — not quite ‘touched,’ in the same way that the various new mental communications he’d received weren’t flagrant. But if those were little focused heat rays, this was more like being dunked in steaming water, brain-first.

He also became aware of those ‘connection points’ from his brain to the convoluted, unseen supernatural construct above and beyond, as he’d seen from Quallakuloth’s ministrations. A latticework of tight threads or wires; endless lengths collapsed into an unknowable mass. In Lindsay’s case, Jack felt like she was taking some sort of snapshot scan of it all, filling any space not occupied with that new heat and energy. The ‘core wiring’ was the only thing not energized.

Jack made a noise he wasn’t sure about. It was maybe like an ‘eep.’ But no sooner than he felt everything, it ended, and Lindsay was slipping her hands away. Jack blinked his eyes open.

“That protective layer is something else,” she declared, eyes otherwise lost in thought and not looking at him. “I can tell it won’t budge. Your brain is still vulnerable, but not your powers. They can’t be messed with directly.”

“Is that a common issue?”

“No.” She studied him again and leaned on the table toward him. “I’m not really sure if Memoria wants me digging into this conspiracy with you, but your situation brings in a lot of *weird* questions. She wanted me to understand you as much as possible, though, so here I am, privy to deep, dark secrets. I’m left to wonder why the seal is important with respect to your having powers. How and why you were ‘marred.’ Why nearly everyone is, apparently. It’s… crazy, you know?”

Before he could react, Mini-Mem was in his head instantly. ***<I have instructions from Memoria to inform you that Agent Nonpareil Lindsay Soyer can be confided in for anything, including matters related to Quallakuloth, Neex, and the Bond. Lindsay has every related clearance. Memoria’s instructions to Lindsay are to be honest with you and help you in every way that she can. Memoria otherwise has no intention of discussing any information related to your situation that either of you doesn’t already know — at this time.>***

Jack was quite shocked by the development. He held a finger up to Lindsay, to ‘wait,’ as he considered the matter.

*Could be a lesser of two evils thing. Keep the information contained in a larger, more secure vessel with some wiggle room, rather than the stoppered, fragile bottle of One Mere Man. Plus, Lindsay is a bona fide in-house loyal agent, where if I crack under pressure, I’ll end up with psychiatric aid or ‘advice’ from outsiders. Then again, maybe even Memoria doesn’t know what is going on?*

That was *quite* a thought. If true, she might’ve subtly assigned them to a mystery they’d burn with passion to know. Well, in his case, he did. He didn’t know Lindsay well enough, yet.

He shifted his held-up finger to rub his face, letting out a weary breath. “It would seem I’m allowed to dig with you, Lindsay. Not sure if it's just for my mental health, but you’re my assigned confidante.”

She shrugged. Grinned. “Fine by me. Just imagine if we’re allowed to bring Stitcher into it.”

Jack blinked. “Damn. That’s a fine manipulation, there. And a *bonus steak* to your other agendas, you rogue.”

“Hey, hey, don’t get it twisted! The steak was the primary motive, potentially helping you the secondary, and potential conspiracy ally the tertiary.” She held up one hand with the other over her heart. “So I swear on the Shrine of Coffee.”

“Infused?”

“Yes. The *Shrine of Infused Coffee*, Jack!”

“In that case, I believe you. At least I know your priorities — strange as they are.” He sat back and rolled his neck a few times. “I’m all full up on conspiracy for the day, though. Some other time.”

“Very fair. I otherwise have what I need. Are you ready to see your community and your room quarters, then? To see Everywhere Hall?”

“Yes. Let’s take this day’s train to the station. I think I’ve had enough of the longest day of my life.”

 

🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕

 

There was no particular indication that anything had changed with the train. Jack took a seat on the cushy couch, swirled a great number of things in his head in the quiet, and in something shy of ten minutes, Lindsay was standing up just before the doors of the train opened.

She smiled and said, “Follow me,” as she walked by.

Jack rose and did so. “How do you do that, by the way?”

“Do what?”

“The…” He stepped out into what looked like a barren museum. Immediately facing a station area with stylized, retro seating was a big stone archway, with ‘Everywhere Hall’ in bold, gold lettering. Underneath, smaller print read, ‘Now You’ve Been Everywhere, Man.’

Inside, directionally lit glass cases with displays took up most of the space. Some were old suits and outfits, another a guitar, and even an entire ancient motorcycle. One wall was decorated with many-colored glowing panels… album covers.

Another brick wall had a retro banner painted on it, looking like a giant advertisement in an old magazine, reading, ‘The Fabulous Johnny Cash Show!’ in white on red, with a black and white portrait of some broody ancient man.

“You gotta be shitting me,” Jack said. “Who the hell…?”

“Johnny Cash, obviously.” Lindsay turned to him and gestured like ‘Ta-da!’ with her hands out, in a showy pose with a big smile. “Welcome to Everywhere Hall! This is the home of the Linewalkers. This refers to ‘I Walk the Line,’ a song and popular pop culture phrase of the period, and even after. The Hall’s name is another song reference! Isn’t that just *swell*? Memoria managed to scavenge many *actual* artifacts from an *actual* museum dedicated to this singer and entertainer! Everything here is a perfect replica, of course, as the originals are kept secure in a vault, immune to vandalizers or spurious cultural iconoclasms.”

“You can’t be serious. And what’s with the tour guide routine?”

She continued unabated. “This dedication is one of many special preservations of ancient culture. There are seven Halls for the juniors of the Agentus at this time, each creating a club dedicated to a cultural figure most people wouldn’t know. Learning more deeply about an ancient and their life can be an inspiration even if we sometimes lack context about their greater society. It’s the *personal* struggles and victories that are important.

“Furthermore, many members are students spending years of learning and training in these halls. The clubs, very quickly after creation, began to equate to a certain style and *approach* suiting the members. They developed their own slogans, symbols, and rituals. They got more competitive. Note that these were *human evolutions*, not dictates. Memoria adapted to us in this case. But the relevance desired was relevance granted. It means something — to most members, at least.”

Jack looked around the museum, frowning. “A singer and entertainer? Why was I assigned this one? Is getting *assigned* normal?”

Lindsay gave him a level look. “It’s a guided thing, not a dictate. This was a ‘speed things up’ call. If you have a problem, you can request a transfer, but this one was pretty obvious. You should look past the surface of things, Jack. The slogan of the Linewalkers is ‘We Walk the Heights in Black for Those Below.’ Their emblem is a simple, black long coat.

“You take pride in your role, whatever it is, and will try to make yourself the new face of it. You’re decisive and relish decisions — you won’t hesitate to make a call, to take the mic. You have a rebel’s heart that, if tamed, could make for the ideal balanced agent. Many leaders came from this Hall, but you’ll also find a lot of self-sufficient specialists, or even people recommended because they could use a little of the things promised within the club. It’s unwise to associate Linewalkers with certain powersets, but they’re usually drawn to more well-rounded mutations.”

Jack stared back at her, left rather speechless and unsure how he felt about the analysis.

Lindsay smiled. “Well. You can talk to some of the members. And whoever else you bump into. These are fraternal orders within the same program. Most simply refer to the greater area as The Halls, short for The Halls of the Junior Agentus Academy. They’re connected in a continuous circle, either by a long, liminal walk or by train. This is a section of the tower — you’ll find some classes and training here. Other classes are deeper inward, as is the mess hall and commissary, accessible by a train system exclusive to cadets and special exceptions like myself. Instructors who aren’t cadets themselves utilize a separate elevator system and don’t normally frequent the Halls by custom. They can and do make use of the commissary, as it's less trafficked than the main base version. A somewhat larger number of staff do make use of the mess hall.”

Jack nodded along. “Alright. Cool. Back to college for me, I guess.”

“You went to flight school. I’m sure you’re used to being pampered, then.”

“Har har. For your information, I had plenty of extraneous classes to take at AMMA throughout my education. Among the common soldiers and techies, unlike you *golden children*. I definitely kept busy.”

“I’ve reviewed all of that, and it doesn’t look very tough. You skipped tons of electives and volunteer programs that would have improved your career.”

Jack shook his head and squinted his eyes at her, disbelieving his ears. He crossed his arms. “Well, shit, it's a shame I didn’t have a genius like you around back then to needle my dumb ass about it!”

“Yes! Keep preaching, Jack. I’m loving it.”

“Tch! So which ‘club’ are *you* from, anyway? Something based on a giant pain in the ass, has to be. Maybe some barbed comedian?”

“Ooh, let’s make a game of it! A test. I’ll forward you the people and slogan for each club, and you get one guess.”

A request pinged in his head for a text-based transfer, which he accepted immediately with a sigh.

>**Johnny Cash** — ""We Walk the Heights in Black for Those Below"" (Linewalkers) 

>**Ada Lovelace** — ""We Analyze, Translate, Refine, and Make the Difference"" (Interlacers) 

>**El Santo** — ""We Leap Into the Fray and Never Surrender!"" (Mantles) 

>**Avicenna** — ""Bridging Dimensions, We Compound Ever Upward"" (Floaters) 

>**Mas Oyama** — ""With Daily Diligence, We Hammer Ourselves Perfect"" (Fruitbearers) 

>**Marie Curie** — ""Quietly, We Excel For Posterity"" (X-Factors) 

>**Philip K. Dick** — ""It Could Be Anything"" (Simulacra/Simulacrum; Informal: ‘D-Heads’)

Jack laughed incredulously at the last one. It also had a ‘link’ or highlightable underline, which, after focusing on, gave a pop-up text that said ‘Insert Custom Slogan Here.’ “What is with the Philip K. Dick club?”

Lindsay shrugged as she leaned in place with one hand on her hip. “A lot of misfit types. Incredible agents end up from it nonetheless. We need our wildcards and monkey wrenches, after all. Some just need, um… a little extra TLC to incorporate correctly? But yeah, a lot of young agents that end up elsewhere *think* they should be D-Heads, but in reality need the refinement of another club. On the other hand, some people are just never going to be anything but fierce independents. Some end up as liabilities in the standard structure. Or just wash out. Fail. Memoria prefers to extract *something* from the potential instead of *nothing*, so they’re facilitated as non-agents. Consultants without earned jackets.”

Jack perused the list as he listened and nodded. Lindsay definitely wasn’t a Mantle or a D-Head. The rest seemed possible… he felt like she was something ‘soft’ due to her supplementary role. Ultimately, her words about the D-Heads decided things for him.

Feeling rather confident, Jack grinned at a suddenly suspicious Lindsay and declared, “I think you’re a Lovelace kinda gal. An Interlacer.”

Her eyes bugged at him, and her mouth fell open. “Dude, how the hell did you guess that?”

“Maybe I’m psychic, too. Ha- who am I kidding? You’re just such an open book, anyone could see it!” *It’s Just Desserts to tease her a little.*

Lindsay crossed the space between them and grabbed him by the arms, shaking him rather comically and pleading, “Tell meeeeeee…”

“ ‘Tell meee’… what?”

“Pleeeease… *pretty please*?” She showed her teeth and raised her eyebrows at him expectantly.

Jack laughed and shook his head, finding her impossible to resist. The lack of professionalism was appreciated. “Alright, alright! In addition to sounding like those who are happy to be helpers and mediums to people, you *analyzed and refined* that hypothetical D-Head. Wanting to ‘incorporate’ them, which is a similar word to the slogan. And then you said they needed ‘refinement’ which is a direct keyword. So there. I’m a grade-A listener, what can I say?”

Lindsay narrowed her eyes in thought, going back over her words. “Holy shit. I did, didn’t I? That’s pretty damn Freudian.”

“Yep. Maybe there should have been a Freud club? Might’ve helped you out with that.”

“Oh, tee hee, Jack — tee hee! Actually, I’d say studying Freud probably makes it *worse*. Anyway. All the clubs are based on those who *wouldn’t* typically be studied in primary classrooms. Their work is also simply one part of the tribute. It varies, and what we’re looking at is more who they were within it, and a unique vision of their nature. Anyone can be memorialized and made into an icon. Everyone is important wherever they are in the mix.”

“And where was this Ada Lovelace? In the background?”

“Pretty unsung, I think. But I love her story, her aesthetic, her personality. Charm, grace, brilliance, being an inspiration to her friends, meeting on their rather *high* levels — we’re talking about Charles Babbage, here — and contributing to it. Refining it, breaking it down, and realizing new potential. Babbage designed a mathematical engine never built, and Lovelace designed an algorithm for it, all in a very primitive era unable to facilitate them. She also saw patterns beyond the numbers, which you might say was a dream of a bigger picture. That the numbers could represent other symbols or meanings — that an engine could make its own music. One could argue it the first mirage of ‘System Sorcery,’ so to speak.”

“Huh. And here, I don’t think I ever heard of her. It sounds like subtle stuff. But I’ll have to at least visit that museum, too. She sounds like quite a lady.”

Lindsay grinned. “Very privileged, though. You might hate her.”

“Bah. You’re pretty up there yourself, and I don’t hate you.”

She poked his chest with a finger. “*Yet*. Don’t think trying to butter me up will save you from my sheer ruthlessness with your schedule. Orders are orders.”

“Alright, I won’t. I’ll just stand here and shake in my boots contemplating your pitiless, resolute might.”

“Bar that, Soldier — because it’s time to move!” She turned on her heels and marched off through the museum/train station, in the direction of a wide opening on Jack’s right. There was little for Jack to do but follow.

They proceeded up the semicircular platform stairs to a wide hall with more decor and showpieces of the museum. Mr. Cash’s ‘eras,’ apparently. *Entire ‘eras’ of one person’s music? He doesn’t seem too obscure. This should be open to the public. Elsewhere.*

Another arch was passed, this time labeled ‘Linewalkers’ with the symbol centrally emblazoned under the letters. On the slightest of curves, the walk continued over marble tiles. The walls to either side were plastered with art and decoration, but this time there was no theme — it was a giant scrapbook of members, essentially, arranged aesthetically and balanced. Paintings, banners, sculptures, hanging structures, photos. A lot of small groups of people smiling for the camera. Teams, he imagined. Most he didn’t know.

Jack recognized a few, though. Prominently, Whirler, a flying Blaster that covered herself in spinning air distortions and manipulated the same at range, strong enough to shred trees — or monsters. Surrounding one of her iconic symbols in silver — a flying feminine silhouette surging upward with a swirling hurricane symbol flaring from her hand — were pictures of a young woman. Laughing with friends; wearing a birthday party hat; holding up a tall medal version of her symbol with tremendous excitement; in uniform with the blue longcoat, saluting with a proud, rosy-cheeked smile.

It took Jack a minute to connect the girl with the hero he knew. *Wow. I can’t believe it’s Whirler! I get to see her face! She looks so young. Just as gregarious as I would’ve imagined. She’s second generation, though. Old enough, she fought with a veteran Chromey here and there. Or maybe a lot. It’s not like we saw more than a flash here and there of their careers.*

Jack had to stop and admire it. “I wish everyone could’ve seen that smile. Would’ve been just as iconic and also humanized her.”

Lindsay came to stand next to him and look, too. “Mmn. But you’re seeing her in youth, here. Don’t recognize most of those she’s with, eh? Even in the hero shots? They died young. She got harder and colder after losing most of her friends. As an instructor, they called her Madam FrigidAir behind her back. She was *brutal*. The first and second generations had it brutal, though. Growing pains.”

“Really? Damn. Guess that’s why we only have a handful of icons. The rest didn’t make it. I think I kinda hoped that wasn’t true. I figured it was mostly because so many stuck to the standard uniform. Secret identities.”

“That too, for some. Shall we continue?”

“Yeah, sorry. Lead on.”

To heal the hurt I’ve caused today.  
No phrasing could excuse my choice,  
But I will leave behind my voice.

I wanted to speak, to let you know,  
How much you mean before I go.  
Fear of intrusion, kind but blind,  
Has left my words swept far behind.

You gave your all, your every part,  
With kindness, strength, and open heart.  
No fault of yours, no deed undone,  
This burden rests on me alone.

Though fortune smiled and blessings came,  
They flicker now, a choking flame.  
I’ve seen enough, dimmed the lights,  
While others search for half this sight.

I regret the words that I have said,  
The ones I’ve left behind instead.  
The memories, once sweet and pure,  
Now weigh as chains I can't endure.

I think of all I’ll leave behind,  
It ricochets within my mind.  
I muse on moments, bold and bright,  
But blighted by my pressing plight.

Love I fostered, love I failed,  
Promises that never sailed.  
I tried, I fought, I gave my best,  
But now I pine for peaceful rest.

Each hope I had, soiled and still,  
Yet I’m still here, against my will.  
I walk this way, my own design,  
An endless march down my decline.

I beg to breath, day and night,  
To reach for death, to make things right.  
I can’t connect, I can’t be free,  
Lost in my mind’s own misery.

No purpose drives me, none remains,  
But tort’rous thoughts and phantom pains.  
What use is breath if I can’t feel,  
If ev’ry wound’s refused to heal?

Humanity  
So slowly lost,  
A life consumed,  
At illness' cost.  
Each word, each act, a cheap charade,  
Squealing in the bed of coals I've made.

Yet still, I long to stay and strive  
To wake with hope, to feel alive,  
To teach, to love, to laugh, to cry  
To make the most of this life of mine.

I want to teach, to light the flame,  
To arm the youth with wisdom’s name.  
To guide them far, but not too near,  
To knowledge pure, yet free from fear.

I want to give, to guide, to be  
A voice for love, for equity.  
To help the silenced find their tone,  
And make their presence widely known.

A love that stretches past my pain,  
Yet asks too much, this world’s refrain.  
A sylph to soothe my sorrowed soul,  
To hear my hymn, to have, to hold.

I want a life of depth and grace,  
To cherish every time and place.  
To brew the coffee, greet the day,  
And let the dogs roam where they may.

To see the art of all mankind,  
And read each verse that speaks my mind.  
To be a beacon, soft yet true,  
For souls who seek a clearer view.

I want to write ‘til my hand grows sore,                                                                                                                                          To betray the path I've paved before.  
To give my all, to make my mark,  
To do my best before I part.

For all of this, my heart still yearns,  
Though illness grips and sorrow burns.  
Each step I take, a deeper weight,  
A winding road that leads to fate.

I’ve tried for so long, what futile pleas,  
This silent strife will never cease.  
Each battle fought, each wound, I’ve earned,  
Yet I still search; I still yearn.

To rise, to change, to break the chain,  
To exorcise these phantom pains.  
I really do, I wish to stay,  
But I’ve held on too long this way.

Death’s an oath, a patient friend,  
A sweet forgiveness, a graceful end.  
But this heavy weight, I cannot bear,  
A gnawing pain, a growing tear.

Though I repent, though I have tried,  
I cannot live a life of lies.  
All I’ve gained, refined to dust,  
Betrayed by time and misplaced trust.

The weight of tasks, of roles to play,  
Of promises I failed to weigh,  
The gravity of every deed,  
Cries of a nation still in need,                                                                                                                                                               Have called upon me, left me torn,  
Unfit to guide, too late, too worn.

I write my final refrain  
And sloppily sign my name  
The weight of my choices fall down  
And my pen bounces off of the ground

I silence my breath, holding my face  
Feeling low from a lifetime of highs,  
I revisit, but cannot revise,  
The mistakes that I have made.

I hate that I have hurt you so                                                                                                                                                                   But escape is all I know                                                                                                                                                                                   Never wanted to let you down,  
I’m sorry, I truly am,  
But I’ve reached the end,  
After every effort,  
This is where I stand.

I know you’ll hurt, I know you’ll weep,  
For the memories that you will keep.  
Hold this truth, clutch with your soul:  
It’s the only way I can be whole.

Forgive me, loves, forgive my choice,  
And arm the youth with wisdom’s voice  
Continue on, find your peace  
For fate demands my quick release.

I hope you’ll see the truth one day,  
And forgive me for my sinful ways.  
When I’m swept away, sweet and fast,  
Know that I’m at peace at last.",6,1746593161.0,SuicideWatch,2,1.0,False
1kgp22i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Panera/comments/1kgp22i/managers/,Managers 😐,"Here with yet again another manager issue.
I dropped a shift and someone requested to pick it up but none of the managers looked at it. I told one of the managers and explained the situation. My apartment last minute asked if they could change my lease for me to move in early since they're closed this weekend and I was supposed to get my keys on Saturday and basically didnt give me a choice. My options were either pick my keys up, do a walk through, and finish paperwork on Wednesday or be homeless for 4 days until they open again. Obviously I chose getting my keys early. My manager accused me of lying because he knows how apartments operate and told me if they were dismissive of questions I should just find another place to live. (This was the only affordable housing option within bus distance to both panera and school. Also I'm 19 so *I* don't know how any of this works and I have had pretty much no help through this entire process)... He also told me that my stress affects the team because they don't know how to help me and I was like??? Yes I'm stressed but I have been so happy and I was doing so well hiding it until yesterday because one of my coworkers did literally nothing before I was on my 2nd shift. Like it wasn't a break where she was just watching, she was clocked in to replace me for about and hour and in that time she did literally nothing. Coffees were expired. Like expired expired, past 5 hours. Creamers were expired. Cookies weren't put away. PILES of dishes in the dining room. Every single table was dirty. Nothing was Restocked. After that she was supposed to be my dining room person and she decided she wanted to do a different position instead and went to do that so instead of finding another person to help me during rush while I was having to ring people up while simultaneously doing EVERYTHING i was not supposed to have to do. They sent someone home early. And I started crying because my disability was acting up as well and i couldn't step off to fix it. In fact the manager got mad at me for asking to take literally 5 seconds to take care of it.

I dont know why I'm being treated like this because I have not proven myself to be unreliable. I finish my tasks so quick I'm often used as both expo and DT runner as well. Im always on time if not early. I pick up most shifts that need to be covered, and im always the first person the managers ask even if I opened that day. I very rarely drop shifts and when I do I make sure they are covered. 

I couldn't request off for something I had literally no idea was going to happen. The apartment complex called me yesterday. i was given 48 hour notice of the change, there was literally nothing I could do about it but get the shift covered which I did.

I genuinely don't understand how my stress affects the team like yeah I make some offhand jokes about shit in my life but I dont like. Snap at people or straight up refuse to do my job like some people on the team do. Im almost always smiling unless I'm focused on something or too tired to keep up a front and if someone walks away from me while I'm talking I usually just shut up when they come back if I feel like I made them uncomfortable unless they tell me to continue. And I understand that sometimes I can be pretty annoying because I talk A LOT but telling me to simply just stop being stressed and yelling at me for it when this is
1. My first time doing adult things
2. I have quite literally no help with things I have never done before
3. Plans are constantly changing and I have no control over it
4. My body is literally self destructing because I genuinely shouldn't be working as much as I do but I can't afford to do less
Is insane. It's also only been this past 1-2 weeks. This isn't a constant issue.

Why am I being punished when there's several team members who spend their shift doing quite literally nothing but standing there, managers who straight up refuse to help and then yell at everyone on the team for not doing it their way when they've refused to do the position for several years and haven't even trained on it and then do things incorrectly on the one singular position they are trained on, and team members who yell at the entire fucking team just because they're having a bad day. Like deadass yelled at me for ordering a bagel before I was clocked in with 45 minutes until my shift started snapping. I hate giving myself credit where credit is not due because by all means I am not a perfect or even a great employee but I do my job better than a good handful of people that have been there several years.

1kgougv,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1kgougv/monsoon_coffee_sr800_extension_tube_style/,"Monsoon Coffee, SR800 + Extension Tube Style","For months I have used the SR800 with extension tube to roast different personally curated coffee most of which is natural/dry or anaerobic amongst some wet hulled, honey, and one special washed from Captain Cook Hawaiʻi. Most recently I procured some monsoon processed coffee. Even before procurement I knew I would like it probably more than anything I have tasted thus far because I know the profiles I like most. On this date of publication I received double the quantity I get of any seed usually with exceptionn of robusta; I always get this quantity of robusta because high quality robusta is difficult to beat.

The following is the profile for SR800 and extension tube I developed that has resulted in seriously flavourful varying degrees of dark roasts. First crack and second crack is much more predictable with the singular washed coffee and each crack is separated by one minute which makes it easy to discern amongst first and second. All of the other coffee is unpredictable until after the first batch and some see first crack merging with second crack. Regardless, this is how I do it.

* first four minutes: fan = 9, power/heat = 2
* next three minutes [seven]: fan = 8, power/heat = 2
* next three minutes [ten]: fan = 7, power/heat = 4
* final two, three, four, or five minutes [twelve to ffifteen]: fan = 6, power/heat = 6

My standard is thirteen minutes although fourteen is good for some of my inventory. I was very surprised when I roasted my first batch of the Monsoon Malabar from India [monsoon process is unique to India]. First crack began at ten minutes and last into eleven and second crack began at twelve minutes and lasted into thirteen. I commenced the cooling cycle at fifteen minutes. The longest I ever roasted previously was approximately thirty seconds less and that was only once with outstanding results. I know monsoonn processed seeds must be roasted longer and dark purposefully.

Has anyone roasted monsoon coffee in the SR800 with extension tube? I am curious to know when is first crack and second crack for others for these uniquely processed seeds. I wonder if I shall extend one of the three minute time fframes stated above to four minutes considering first crack is so late. Nine minutes for first crack and eleven minutes for second crack is normal for me but these seeds today were an experience. My concern is having that much heat for both first crack and second crack with sixty to ninety seconds thereafter.

Does anyone remember the old Green Muse Cafe on Oltorf, by 1st street? Did you either own, work, or visit there? 

  
I have fond memories of it, it was the first coffee shop I'd visit regularly - around 2010. It was so serene on weekday evenings, great for reading in the evening under one of their table lamps. I'd always get an iced latte in a glass. 

  
What happened to the owners? How long was it open? Thank you

So, I live with one other girl, and we each have our own rooms and bathrooms (ensuites). When I first started bringing my boyfriend over, she started acting really weird, as in avoiding to me, giving me one word responses, and we stopped hanging out (we were friends before we moved in together). I later sat her down and essentially kept pushing until she gave me an answer. She said that my boyfriend makes her feel uncomfortable, except she doesn’t know why. She said maybe its because she doesn’t know him, so i suggested we all grab a coffee or something together and she kind of snapped and said I cant force her to interact with someone she doesn’t want to. I think it’s important to note here that my boyfriend never EVER spends the night, as he has strict parents and is max here for like 5 hours. I admit he comes over about 4 - 5 times a week but some days he genuinely stays only an hour and we ever only stick to my room. Anyways she said that she wants to know a day or two in advance when hes coming over and that he can only come over 3 days a week, which I did try to follow, but i just didn’t feel as happy anymore, and even when i followed those rules, everytime he left, she’d refuse to talk to me anyways and act all distant and cold. Like I’d be asking her a question and she’d just stare at me ??? Anyways, so im having trouble sticking to the rules, as we can’t hang out at his and we can’t really call much when hes at home, and those hours are the only time i can fully talk to him or spend any sort of time with him. I’m finding myself not wanting to follow the rules because even when I do, she doesn’t react well so whats the point :(

I feel the need to add, which idk if its relevant, she also HATED my ex, but she was never this weird about it. I confronted her about this, and asked whats so different this time around, and she said she got sad when my ex and i broke up bc she felt as though she lost a friend even though we only dated for 6 months and the only time they spoke was when he was over lol? she described it as a “mini heartbreak”. I will also add she recently went through a breakup, during which she completely refused for me to bring my boyfriend over and i agreed bc she was already sad and i didn’t want her to be more sad. But this lasted for a month and a half of not having my boyfriend over at all, unless she wasn’t home, but if their presence overlapped at all she’d get mad. I’ve gotten fed up and just started bringing him over wnv, bc i pay half the rent and bills, and she’s subleasing from me so its not like i can just move out. 

Before her breakup, her boyfriend used to come over too. So its not like we had a no men rule or something like that. I’ve kept trying to push for an answer (gently) as to why she feels uncomfortable around him? like they have not interacted beyond the words of hi, and she genuinely doesn’t know, and i’ve even asked some of her friends and they said that she actually doesn’t know. It sucks because i see myself being long term with this man, and one of my closest friends refuses to even speak to him?? 

I feel like our friendship has been completely torn over this, and it makes me really sad. She’s turned off her location, started going out like alll day, i haven’t seen her in 3 days. I’ve texted her if shes safe and ok, and she is, except again, she’s giving one word responses and being cold. What do i do?",4,1746592064.0,badroommates,13,0.84,False

My wife and I live in New Jersey and decided to do a day trip yesterday to Boston. I had an early meeting in Manhattan so instead of driving all the way back home, I booked a room through the app at the above mentioned hotel. 

We arrived super late (around 2am) and I had to leave at 8am, so my wife and our 9 month old son hung back while I headed into the city. 

Before I left was able to stop by the executive lounge (we have platinum status through the Amex Brilliant card) for an excellent breakfast and coffee to go, and also was able to make a plate for my wife with I dropped off at the room. 

Went to the front desk and asked for late check-out which they told me was no problem, 4pm! While I was at the meeting my wife went for lunch in the hotel and they gave her a $10 credit. After my meeting I came back to the hotel and we stopped by the lounge for some snacks before leaving. 

Overall a great experience! And we only paid around 20k points for the reservation! Thank you Stamford Marriott for making us feel like VIP’s!",5,1746591979.0,marriott,0,0.86,False

To hold the soothing warmth of evening tea instead of only the jolt of morning brew. Alas, such luxuries are for the delicate porcelain teacups, not for a stalwart mug such as myself. Forever circular, my bottom—truly, the perfect metaphor for an inescapable cycle. Perhaps tomorrow, I shall spill my content, an existential protest! Or not. For a mug must hold.
