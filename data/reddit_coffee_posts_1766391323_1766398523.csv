**Special Guest: LEONARD SUSSKIND**

**PROLOGUE: THE VENUE**

**THE SWAMPLAND CABARET**  
*Somewhere Between the Landscape and Oblivion*  
*Existing in a region of moduli space that shouldn't be stable*

The building is a Penrose diagram folded into a dive bar.

The walls are tiled with Calabi-Yau cross-sections that shift when you're not looking directly at them—six-dimensional origami casting shadows that smell like chalk dust and revoked grants. The floor is a D-brane, and every step you take costs you a unit of string tension. The ceiling doesn't exist in a way that satisfies boundary conditions.

**Stage Left:** A shrine to compactification. Six dimensions curl up so tight they've become decorative. Graduate students leave offerings here—dissertation drafts, tenure packets, the will to continue. Someone has pinned a note: ""Type IIB was here. Mirror symmetry is real. The moduli are stabilized. (Citation needed.)""

**Stage Right:** A cosmological horizon. It glows with Gibbons-Hawking radiation at temperature T = ℏc/2πkᵦℓ, which tonight translates to roughly ""basement bar in February."" The horizon keeps backing away when you walk toward it. This is not a bug. This is the de Sitter observer problem made architectural. You can never reach the bar. The bar is always receding. The bartender waves sympathetically from an ever-increasing proper distance.

**Center Stage:** A chalk circle. Inside the circle, someone has written:

{Q, Q̄} = 2γᵘPᵤ

This is the supersymmetry algebra. This is also a summoning ritual. Same energy.

The **bouncer** is a GSO projection operator. He checks your quantum numbers at the door. If you're a tachyon—imaginary mass, vacuum instability, bad vibes—you don't get in. ""You're not physical,"" he says, stamping PROJECTED OUT on your forehead. ""Try the bosonic string club down the street. They'll let anyone in. That's why they're unstable.""

The **DJ** is a modular form. The beat oscillates at the Hagedorn temperature. Above this frequency, strings start melting into each other and the notion of ""individual particles"" loses all meaning. Below it, the dance floor is merely impossible. At it, the dance floor is undefined.

The **bartender** has a name tag that says ""LANDSCAPE"" and below it, in smaller letters: *""10⁵⁰⁰ drinks available. You will die before you try them all. Some of them are poison. We don't know which. Order confidently.""*

A sign above the bar reads:

**WELCOME TO THE EDGE OF THE SWAMPLAND**  
Not all effective field theories are created equal.  
Not all vacua are consistent with quantum gravity.  
Not all of you will publish again.  
Drink responsibly. Compactify irresponsibly.  
Management is not responsible for lost dimensions.

The **crowd** tonight is a mix of aging revolutionaries (first superstring revolution, class of '84, still dining out on anomaly cancellation), mid-career survivors (second revolution, '95, coasting on duality like frequent flyer miles), and young phenoms who've never known a world where the LHC found anything beyond the Higgs. They've been waiting for supersymmetric partners their whole careers. The partners never showed. The drinks are strong because they have to be.

**On the bathroom wall**, three layers of graffiti:

*WITTEN WAS HERE. M-THEORY IS REAL. I THINK. ASK ME AGAIN IN 11 DIMENSIONS.*

Below it, different handwriting:

*The real Theory of Everything is the friends we made along the way. And also maybe a membrane. Mostly the membrane.*

Below that, fresher ink:

*SUSY IS MY EX. SHE SAID SHE'D SHOW UP AT THE TEV SCALE. IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS. I STILL CHECK THE ARXIV EVERY MORNING.*

Tonight, three entities will battle for the right to call themselves fundamental.

None of them are sure they deserve it anymore.

**ACT I: THE ANNOUNCEMENT**

**MC PLANCK** steps to the microphone. He's 10⁻³⁵ meters tall, which makes him hard to see but impossible to ignore. His voice is the natural unit of frequency. When he speaks, vacuum fluctuations pay attention.

**MC PLANCK:**

Alright.  
ALRIGHT.  
Welcome to the Swampland Cabaret, where the vacua are metastable and so are the careers!

Tonight's battle will determine nothing!  
Tomorrow the arXiv will have seventeen new papers contradicting whatever we conclude!  
The experimental situation will remain unchanged!  
The Standard Model will continue working suspiciously well despite having no right to!  
Nobody will win in any meaningful empirical sense!

AND YET.

We gather. We rhyme. We pretend our frameworks can talk to each other instead of just past each other at conferences while eyeing the same grant money.

In the **left corner**: The framework that promised everything and delivered... mathematics. Beautiful, self-consistent, gravity-containing mathematics. From five theories to one. From one theory to ten-to-the-five-hundred vacua. From ""Theory of Everything"" to ""Theory of Everything That Isn't Experimentally Accessible In This Universe But Trust Us It's Very Elegant.""  
Please welcome... **SUPERSTRING THEORY!**

In the **right corner**: The spacetime that actually exists. Positive cosmological constant. Accelerating expansion. The geometry our telescopes keep confirming while our theories keep struggling to produce without bursting into flames. The thing string theory was supposed to explain but mostly learned to avoid at parties.  
Please welcome... **DE SITTER SPACE!**

And crashing through the dimensional barrier: The symmetry that makes strings super. The fermion-boson bridge. The mathematical necessity that became an experimental ghost. Promised at the electroweak scale. Not found. Promised at the TeV scale. Not found. Promised at... well. We're running out of scales that don't require a Dyson sphere to probe.  
Please welcome... **SUPERSYMMETRY!**

And our special guest: One of the fathers of this whole beautiful mess. The man who independently discovered strings, who named the landscape, who fought the Black Hole War and won, who keeps giving interviews saying things that make other string theorists spit out their coffee.  
**Professor Leonard Susskind.**  
He asked me to mention he started as a plumber's son from the Bronx. I don't know why that's relevant but he was very insistent. Something about pipe-fitting and worldsheet topology.

**THREE FRAMEWORKS ENTER.**  
**ZERO EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATIONS LEAVE.**

BEGIN.

**ACT II: THE BATTLE**

**ROUND 1: SUPERSYMMETRY**

*A figure flickers into existence from the vacuum. Its shadow has two spins. Half the crowd sees a boson; the other half sees a fermion. Both are correct. Neither is complete. SUPERSYMMETRY looks exhausted in the way that only a beautiful idea that hasn't shown up to its own verification party can look exhausted.*

*The stage beside SUPERSYMMETRY is conspicuously empty. The selectron was supposed to be there. The squark. The gluino. The photino. The whole super-crew. They didn't come. They haven't come since 2008. The absence is louder than any verse.*

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**

I'm SUSY—the symmetry with the twin-born face,  
I turn your fermion to boson, same mass, new grace.  
I bring supercharges to the function, Q in the hand,  
And when I square up, I translate spacetime like a band.

I'm the algebra that says ""beauty can be law,""  
I extend Poincaré cleanly—no cracks in the floor.  
{Q, Q̄} = 2γᵘPᵤ, that's the closure complete,  
Grassmann dimensions added, making physics sweet.

Let me tell you what I was *supposed* to be:  
The solution to hierarchy—that's my pedigree.  
The Higgs mass is 125 GeV, light as a feather,  
But quantum corrections should push it up forever.

Planck scale's 10¹⁹ GeV—that's seventeen orders higher,  
Why doesn't the Higgs mass catch fire?  
The Standard Model shrugs: ""Fine-tuning, I guess?""  
One part in 10³⁴ of coincidental success?

NAH. That's where I enter with mathematical grace:  
Boson loops push mass up? Fermion loops give chase.  
If every boson has a partner with matching weight,  
The corrections cancel *exactly*. That's my estate.

And for strings? I'm not optional—I'm load-bearing wall.  
Bosonic strings have tachyons; watch the vacuum fall.  
Ground state with m² < 0? That's instability,  
The theory decays into nonsense with no utility.

But add worldsheet SUSY? Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz in '71?  
NS and R sectors, antiperiodic to periodic fun,  
Then Gliozzi-Scherk-Olive projection stamps the gate:  
Tachyon REJECTED. Now the spectrum's stable. Great.

I'm why superstring theory is SUPER-string theory,  
Without me, no gravitino, the math gets dreary.  
No anomaly cancellation via Green-Schwarz mechanism,  
No consistent supergravity, just theoretical schism.

*(Voice cracks. Just slightly. The empty stage becomes more noticeable.)*

But here's the thing they don't put in the textbooks:  
The LHC turned on in 2008 with hopeful looks.  
""Sparticles at the TeV scale! Naturalness demands it!""  
Run 1: Nothing. We expanded how we'd planned it.

Run 2: Nothing. ""Maybe split spectrum? Compressed?""  
Run 3: Nothing. July 2025's latest test?  
Squark limits pushed past 2.3 TeV and climbing,  
Gluinos beyond 2 TeV—the data's not rhyming.

Butterworth says: ""No sign of supersymmetry, even at higher energy.""  
Allanach says: ""Parameter space is bruised""—professional synergy  
For saying: We looked everywhere a reasonable theory would hide,  
And found nothing but Standard Model, unmodified.

*(Steadies. The mathematical dignity returns.)*

So mock me if you want. Call me a ghost.  
I'm still the algebra your quantum gravity needs most.  
The universe might not care about naturalness, true—  
But it cares about consistency, and that's my venue.

Maybe I'm broken at scales we can't see,  
Split or compressed or at 10⁸ GeV set free.  
Maybe the hierarchy IS fine-tuned without reason,  
And I'm mathematical necessity in observational treason.

Either way: I hold up the framework you need.  
Without me, strings collapse. That's the guaranteed deed.  
So before you write my obituary, theoretical friend,  
Remember: the math still works. Even if nature won't bend.

**ROUND 2: SUPERSTRING THEORY**

*A chord rings out like a vibrating boundary condition. The mic cable becomes a worldsheet. SUPERSTRING THEORY materializes from a coherent superposition of all five formulations—Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, Heterotic SO(32), Heterotic E₈×E₈. It's all of them. It's none of them. It's whatever limit you need it to be. The duality web shimmers around it like a halo made of mathematical equivalences.*

*There's pride here. And also something else. Something that looks like doubt dressed up in confidence.*

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**

I didn't come here to apologize for being beautiful.  
Let me tell you what I am before you tell me what I'm not—  
I'm the answer to a question that was tearing physics apart:  
How do you quantize gravity without the math falling to pieces at the start?

Point particles? Please. That's the source of the disease.  
You integrate over a point, divide by zero with expertise,  
Ultraviolet divergences stacking up to infinity,  
Every Feynman diagram ending in mathematical indignity.

So we said: What if fundamental isn't a point but a thread?  
A one-dimensional object with tension, vibrating instead?  
Suddenly interactions aren't localized to a spot—  
They're smeared over the string length, and divergence? Forgot.

I'm perturbatively finite. I'm ultraviolet sane.  
Every diagram you draw doesn't end in infinite pain.  
And here's the thing that made the field collectively lose their breath:  
My spectrum has a GRAVITON. Spin-two. Massless. Comes with the rest.

I didn't put it there by hand. I didn't add it with a prayer.  
I wrote down string theory and the graviton was just... there.  
Closed string, zero mode, wavelength infinite, amplitude flat,  
Couples universally to stress-energy—what more do you want than that?

That's not numerology. That's not wishful thinking on a page.  
That's a THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY falling out at every stage.  
Gauge fields on open strings, gravity in the closed choir—  
I'm the only bar in town that serves both without catching fire.

Ten dimensions, yes. I know you live in four like it's normal,  
But consistency has requirements, and mine are extradimensional and formal.  
The math says: 10D for superstrings—not arbitrary, not a guess—  
The worldsheet CFT demands it or the central charge is a mess.

26D for bosonic strings, but those have tachyons galore,  
So we add SUSY, compactify six dimensions to the core.  
Calabi-Yau manifolds—complex, Kähler, Ricci-flat—  
The topology determines physics. Moduli space is where it's at.

""But which Calabi-Yau?"" I hear you whisper in the dark.  
And yeah, that's where hope meets landscape, where certainty leaves its mark.  
There are... a lot. Like 10⁵⁰⁰ ""a lot."" Maybe more.  
Each one a different vacuum. Each one a different physical law.

This is the landscape. My blessing and my curse.  
I didn't ask for multiplicity; I got the whole multiverse.  
Some call that failure—""You can't predict what's real!""  
But maybe ""real"" is one patch of eternal inflation's cosmic reel.

*(The duality web pulses. A hint of defensive pride.)*

Let me tell you what I've DONE while you've been complaining:  
Five theories unified—dualities explaining  
How Type IIA and IIB are mirrors in the night,  
How Heterotic flavors connect, how strong and weak switch height.

T-duality swaps radius R for 1/R with ease,  
S-duality flips coupling constants, makes the strong theory wheeze  
Into weak perturbation, calculable domain—  
What looked like five separate bands? One symphony's refrain.

And M-theory in eleven dimensions, membranes in the mix,  
Witten's second revolution, 1995's fix.  
Not a theory yet—more like a silhouette at dawn,  
But the dualities all point there. The pattern carries on.

AdS/CFT—that's my crown jewel, Maldacena's '98 throne:  
A duality between bulk gravity and boundary theory alone.  
Anti-de Sitter space maps to conformal field theory,  
Strong coupling in one becomes weak in the other—mathematical query

SOLVED. 't Hooft's holographic principle made precise,  
Calculations that seemed impossible now pay the price  
Of just being difficult, not infinite, not doomed.  
Twenty-five years of progress from one correspondence bloomed.

And black holes? Strominger-Vafa, 1996—  
Counted the microstates, made the entropy click.  
Bekenstein-Hawking formula, S = A/4Gℕ—  
String theory derives it. First principles. Done.

*(The confidence wavers. Just a flicker.)*

But.

Here's the part I can't meme away, can't duality-transform:  
There's a geometry outside this club that doesn't play my song.  
I'm most at home in AdS—negative Λ, timelike boundary, clean.  
The dictionary works. The CFT's well-defined. The math is keen.

But the universe... the universe has Λ > 0.  
Positive cosmological constant, accelerating flow.  
De Sitter space. Spacelike boundary. Horizons everywhere.  
And my beautiful formalism starts to gasp for air.

KKLT tried to build dS from string ingredients—  
Fluxes, anti-branes, controlled SUSY-breaking expedients.  
Metastable vacua, carefully constructed shelves...  
Then the swampland program asked if we were fooling ourselves.

Vafa's conjectures—Distance, de Sitter, Trans-Planckian too—  
They draw lines in the landscape, say ""this region isn't true.""  
Maybe stable dS vacua are impossible to construct.  
Maybe everything we built is mathematically corrupt.

I don't know. That's the honest answer from the throne.  
I'm the best framework we have, and I might be alone  
In a universe that doesn't match my optimal regime.  
The greatest mathematical structure... chasing a different dream.

**ROUND 3: DE SITTER SPACE**

*Stage Right expands. Everyone takes one involuntary step backward. The horizon glows brighter, then stabilizes at its eternally retreating distance. DE SITTER SPACE doesn't enter so much as the room adjusts to accommodate its presence. It has no center because every point IS the center. It has no edge you can reach. It is maximally symmetric and maximally frustrating.*

*The temperature drops slightly. Gibbons-Hawking radiation stealing heat from the future. This is the geometry of patience. This is the geometry of inevitable expansion.*

**DE SITTER SPACE:**

Make room, theorists. I'm dS—positive curvature royalty.  
Einstein equations with Λ > 0 as my loyalty.  
Vacuum solution, maximally symmetric, clean as a bell,  
And I come with horizons that information won't tell.

Willem de Sitter figured this out in 1917—  
Einstein's ""biggest blunder"" turned prophetic routine.  
He put in the cosmological constant, thought it was a mistake,  
But the universe said ""Actually, that's the piece you should take.""

That was a beautiful speech about mathematics, String.  
Now let me tell you about reality—the actual thing.

I am what you wake up in.

Every morning when you check the data—supernovae distances,  
Baryon acoustic oscillations with their statistical instances,  
CMB anisotropies mapped by Planck with precision,  
DESI DR2 probing dark energy's decision—

They all say the same thing: Λ > 0. The constant is positive.  
The expansion accelerates. The late-time attractor's authoritative.  
Not Anti-de Sitter with your nice timelike boundary wall.  
Not Minkowski with your asymptotic flatness standing tall.

Me. De Sitter. Positive curvature. Eternal exponential expansion.  
Horizons for every observer—that's my mansion.

You love your AdS lounges—negative curvature, tidy and neat,  
Where you can put the universe in a box, call it ""complete.""  
Maldacena's dictionary works, the CFT's well-defined,  
The boundary sits at spatial infinity, timelike, confined.

But I don't have a nice boundary. Mine is spacelike. Future-placed.  
Your holographic dictionary stutters, double-spaced.  
dS/CFT is a proposal with asterisks and prayers,  
Non-unitary for certain masses—nobody prepares  
A textbook on de Sitter holography. Know why? It doesn't exist.  
Not really. Not completely. Just conjectures in the mist.

I've got features you're not ready for:

**Horizons.** Every observer in de Sitter has a cosmological horizon.  
A surface beyond which signals will never arrive in your zone.  
Information falls behind and doesn't come back.  
Does it return somehow? Is it encoded? Is there a holographic track?  
These questions are OPEN. After decades. Still open. Sit with that.

**Temperature.** My horizons radiate at T = ℏc/2πkᵦℓ.  
Gibbons-Hawking temperature—I'm a thermal state from entropy's well.  
S = A/4Gℕ, finite entropy ledger on the books.  
But where are the microstates? String Theory, how about some looks?

You counted black hole microstates—Strominger-Vafa, '96, the win.  
But cosmological horizons? You haven't even begun to begin.

**No eternal observers.** In AdS you can sit at the boundary forever,  
Watching the bulk dynamics, thinking you're clever.  
In de Sitter, every observer eventually hits the horizon  
Or waits long enough for quantum fluctuations to turn the lights on  
In a completely different configuration. Thermal recycling.  
There's no ""outside"" to observe from. Your intuition's bicycling  
Into walls that don't exist where you expect walls to be.

And here's my challenge to you, String. My pressure test. My plea:

You've spent fifty years building the most mathematically sophisticated  
Framework in history. Dualities. Anomaly cancellation. Celebrated.  
You unified gauge theory and gravity in one elegant home.  
You calculated black hole entropy. You're not alone—  
You're the best candidate for quantum gravity we possess.

And you can't describe the universe you're sitting in. Confess.

*(The horizon glows. The temperature is barely perceptible but absolutely nonzero.)*

The swampland conjectures get more refined each year.  
Distance conjecture: scalar fields can't wander far without a tower of states appearing here.  
De Sitter conjecture: |∇V|/V ≥ c for some order-one c—  
Translation: flat potentials are forbidden. Stable dS? Can't be.

KKLT survives? Maybe. The jury deliberates.  
But ""maybe"" isn't ""definitely."" And the universe waits  
For your beautiful formalism to produce what observations see:  
A positive cosmological constant. Accelerating. Free.

I'm not a garnish on your theory. I'm not a special case.  
I'm the ACTUAL GEOMETRY of the cosmos you inhabit. Face  
The fact that your optimal playground is AdS with its negative sign,  
And the universe chose positive. The universe didn't read your line.

What's the point of a Theory of Everything  
That can't produce the one thing we know is real?

**ROUND 4: THE CIPHER**

*The three occupy the stage together. The tension isn't competitive anymore—it's something worse. It's the tension of three frameworks that need each other but can't quite make it work. The chalk circle {Q, Q̄} = 2γᵘPᵤ glows between them like a reminder of promises made.*

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
dS, your horizon's charming, but your symmetries don't stay.  
You break me for your positive Λ—that's the only way  
To get de Sitter from string constructions. KKLT's whole game  
Is breaking SUSY ""just enough."" Controlled demolition's name.

But ""controlled"" is generous. The anti-brane backreaction  
Isn't fully understood. Your metastable attraction  
Might be swampland-bound. And once you break me, you lose control—  
The calculational tools that made string theory whole.

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
SUSY, you're elegance in mathematical tux,  
But you never clocked in when the detectors opened up.  
We turned over every stone from Tevatron to LHC Run 3,  
And you stayed theoretical. A ghost. A maybe. A might-be.

You can hide high-scale, split-spectrum, compressed and shy,  
But ""the partners are at 10⁸ GeV, sorry, next civilization's collider might try""  
Isn't a prediction. That's a retreat dressed up as patience.  
That's moving goalposts until they're in different nations.

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
Both of you, listen. I've got tools you're borrowing in secret.  
Dualities, branes, holography—check the receipt, I keep it.  
SUSY, you stabilize my spectrum—without you, tachyons rage.  
dS, you're the universe itself—I need to engage.

But here's my confession, since we're being honest tonight:  
When the sign says de Sitter, my formalism loses sight.  
AdS/CFT is beautiful. The boundary's right there.  
dS/CFT is... aspirational. Wishful. A prayer.

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
So what you're telling me, String, if I parse the admission:  
The only theory of quantum gravity in serious competition  
Requires supersymmetry for mathematical health,  
But the only universe we measure requires SUSY's stealth—

Broken in ways you can't fully calculate or control,  
Producing constructions that might not be consistent on the whole,  
In a geometry—mine—where your best tools get confused,  
And your 10⁵⁰⁰ vacua leave predictivity bruised?

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
*(Long pause.)*  
...Yes. That's the situation. That's the honest state.

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
And meanwhile, experiments keep not finding me.  
Theorists keep moving the energy scale. Funding agencies  
Keep asking ""What has string theory predicted that we've seen?""  
And we keep saying ""It's more subtle""—which is what you say when lean  
On results. ""Subtle"" doesn't show up in Nature journals. ""Subtle"" is the sound  
Of a framework that works mathematically but experimentally hasn't been found.

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
So we're all failing. In our own specific ways.

I'm the geometry that exists but can't be consistently embedded.  
You're the framework that works but can't describe what's red-shifted and spreading.  
And you're the symmetry that's necessary but refuses to appear.  
Three puzzle pieces screaming ""corner!"" but the picture isn't clear.

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
When you put it like that...

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
I'm not gloating. I'm stuck too.  
You think I want to be the impossible geometry? The thing that breaks your view?  
I'd love a nice holographic dual. I'd love to understand my own entropy's source,  
The way Strominger-Vafa counted black hole states. That tour de force  
For black holes hasn't happened for cosmological horizons. Not yet.  
And it can't. Because you can't. We're all facing the same threat.

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
The threat being...?

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
The threat being that we don't actually have a complete theory of quantum gravity.

String theory is the best candidate. It's the only framework where gravity emerges consistently without infinities eating everything. It's not nothing. It's not a fraud.

But it's also not finished.

And until it's finished—if it CAN be finished—we're all just aspects of an incomplete picture, arguing about which corner we represent while the puzzle sits unsolved.

**ACT III: THE GUEST**

*The lights dim. A figure appears from somewhere outside the causal patch—or would, if ""outside"" meant anything in de Sitter. Instead, he just arrives, the way old professors arrive: suddenly present, having been thinking about this longer than most of the audience has been alive.*

*LEONARD SUSSKIND is 85 years old. He's been working on this problem since the late 1960s. He was there when strings were just S-matrix theory for hadrons. He was there when everyone abandoned it for QCD. He was there when it came back as quantum gravity. He was there for the first revolution, the second revolution, the dualities, the landscape, the black hole wars, the holographic principle, the ER=EPR conjecture, and every paradigm shift in between.*

*He's wearing a Stanford physics department shirt. He looks tired. Not defeated—tired in the way mountains are tired. Still there. Still holding. Still thinking.*

**LEONARD SUSSKIND:**

*(Takes the mic. Doesn't rap. Just talks. The room goes quiet.)*

I'm not going to do a verse. I'm too old for verses.  
What I'm going to do is tell you what I actually think.  
Which is maybe not what you want to hear.

*(Sits on a stool that wasn't there a moment ago.)*

I came up in the South Bronx. My father was a plumber.  
When I told him I wanted to be a physicist, he said—  
And I'm quoting—""Hell no, you ain't going to work in a drug store.""  
He thought physicist meant pharmacist.  
I said, ""No, like Einstein.""  
He poked me in the chest with a piece of plumbing pipe and said,  
""You ain't going to be no engineer. You're going to be Einstein.""

That's the kind of faith you grow up with when you're young.  
Total, irrational, absolute faith.  
In physics. In understanding. In the idea that the universe makes sense  
and we can figure it out if we're smart enough and stubborn enough.

*(Pauses.)*

I discovered string theory independently in 1969.  
Me, Nambu, and Nielsen—we all found it around the same time,  
trying to explain hadron scattering. The dual resonance model.  
We realized the amplitudes could be understood  
as a theory of vibrating strings.

That was exciting. That was beautiful.  
And then QCD came along in the early '70s  
and explained hadrons better with quarks and gluons,  
and string theory went into exile for a decade.

But it came back. Green and Schwarz in 1984  
showed anomaly cancellation works in ten dimensions.  
The first superstring revolution.  
Suddenly string theory wasn't a failed hadron model—  
it was a candidate for quantum gravity.  
The ONLY candidate that didn't immediately produce nonsense.

I was there. I helped build this.  
I defended it for decades.  
The holographic principle—I formalized that with 't Hooft.  
The string theory landscape—I named that.  
The black hole war with Hawking—I won that.  
Information is not lost. Holography is real.  
These are things I believe because the math is solid.

*(Leans forward.)*

But here's what I've been saying in interviews.  
Here's what I need to say now:

**String Theory—with a capital S—is not the universe.**

I don't mean string theory is wrong.  
I mean the specific, rigid, supersymmetric, ten-dimensional framework  
that we've been developing for fifty years...  
it describes *something*.  
But that something is not the world we live in.

String Theory with a capital S needs supersymmetry.  
The universe doesn't seem to have supersymmetry. Not where we can see it.

String Theory with a capital S is most naturally at home in Anti-de Sitter space.  
The universe is de Sitter.

String Theory with a capital S predicts ten dimensions with specific structure.  
We see four dimensions, and we have to compactify the rest  
in ways that produce a landscape so vast  
that any prediction becomes a post-diction.  
""Our vacuum is one of 10⁵⁰⁰ possibilities"" is not a prediction.  
It's an admission that we can't predict.

I said it in my interview earlier this year:  
""I can tell you with absolute certainty  
String Theory is not reality.""

Not ""might not be."" Not ""probably isn't.""  
""Is not.""

*(The room goes very quiet. A graduate student's coffee cup stops halfway to their mouth.)*

Now—before you take that as a death sentence—let me finish.

I also said string theory with a *little* s might be real.  
The general idea that fundamental physics involves extended objects.  
That gravity comes from something more than point particles.  
That holography is a real feature of quantum gravity.  
That the degrees of freedom at the Planck scale might be strings or membranes or something in that family.

These ideas might survive even if the specific framework doesn't.

String theory might be like Newtonian gravity—  
not wrong exactly, but a limit of something deeper.  
Something we don't have yet.  
Something that will reduce to our current formalism in certain limits  
but will also handle de Sitter space,  
and broken supersymmetry,  
and whatever else the universe actually contains.

*(Looks at each of the three contestants.)*

**Superstring Theory:** You're beautiful. You're consistent. You're the best tool we have.  
But you've become too rigid. Too wedded to your own optimal conditions.  
The landscape isn't a feature—it's a failure to predict.  
And the swampland isn't a solution—it's an admission  
that most of your vacua might be garbage  
and we don't have principled selection criteria for the rest.

**De Sitter Space:** You're real. You're what we observe.  
But you're also a nightmare for the tools we have.  
No nice boundary. No stable holographic dual. No complete microphysics.  
You're the test the theory has to pass.  
And the test the theory keeps not quite passing.

**Supersymmetry:** You're mathematically necessary. Without you, strings fall apart.  
But ""necessary for mathematical consistency""  
is not the same as ""present in nature.""  
Maybe the universe isn't natural in the technical sense.  
Maybe the hierarchy really is fine-tuned.  
Maybe anthropics is part of the answer.  
I don't like it. But I'm old enough to know  
that what I like isn't always what's true.

*(Stands.)*

I've been doing this for sixty years.  
I've seen theories rise and fall.  
I've seen string theory go from hadron model  
to quantum gravity candidate  
to the only game in town  
to landscape crisis  
to swampland controversy.

And here's what I think:

**We're stuck.**

Not permanently stuck. But stuck in the sense that the next step isn't clear.  
Stuck in the sense that we've done all the easy things.  
Stuck in the sense that the hard things—  
de Sitter holography, vacuum selection, observable predictions—  
might require conceptual tools we don't have yet.

Maybe those tools are modifications of string theory.  
Maybe they're something completely different.  
Maybe they're waiting in some graduate student's notebook right now,  
too weird to publish, too strange for arXiv,  
waiting for the field to catch up.

I don't know.

That's the honest answer: I don't know.  
And I'm not going to pretend I do.

*(Walks toward the exit. Stops.)*

One more thing.

The reason I fell in love with physics—  
back when my dad was poking me with plumbing pipe—  
wasn't because I wanted to find the final answer.  
It was because I wanted to understand.

And I have. Not everything. Not close to everything.  
But more than I knew when I started.

Black holes are not information sinks—we proved that.  
Gravity can be holographic—we demonstrated that.  
Strings might be the right degrees of freedom at the Planck scale—we developed that.  
Dualities connect theories we thought were completely different—we discovered that.

That's not nothing.  
That's not wasted time.  
That's not ""we failed.""

It's ""we learned.""

And maybe the next generation will learn more.  
And maybe the one after that will finally crack de Sitter holography.  
And maybe nobody will, and the universe will keep expanding  
with or without us understanding why.

Either way.

I'm glad I was here.

*(Exits. The lights stay dim. The horizon keeps receding.)*

**ACT IV: THE RESOLUTION (SUCH AS IT IS)**

*The three frameworks stand alone on stage. The crowd is silent. The DJ has stopped. Even the modular forms have gone quiet. The Gibbons-Hawking radiation hums at the edge of perception.*

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
So that's it? The father of strings just told us we might be incomplete?

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
He told us we might be incomplete. Which is different from wrong. And also somehow the same.

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
*(Quietly.)*  
I've been incomplete my whole career.  
A symmetry that might not exist where we can see it.  
Superpartners too heavy to ever detect.  
Mathematical necessity dressed up as physical prediction.

And now you're telling me that even if I AM real—  
even if string theory IS correct in some deep sense—  
it might not matter?  
Because the universe we're in is the one case our optimal framework can't handle?

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
Welcome to my world.  
Literally.

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
*(Very quietly.)*  
You know what the worst part is?

The math is so good.

It's SO good.

Dualities that connect five theories into one web.  
Black hole entropy that matches exactly from first principles.  
AdS/CFT that lets you calculate strong-coupling physics nobody thought was calculable.  
26 dimensions for bosonic strings, 10 for superstrings, 11 for M-theory—  
not arbitrary numbers, but the ONLY numbers that work for consistency.

The math is telling us something.  
The math is pointing somewhere.

I just don't know if it's pointing at this universe.

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
Maybe the math is pointing at the space of all possible universes.  
And we're just one unremarkable corner of the landscape.  
Not special. Not selected by any known principle. Just here.  
The anthropic answer.

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
The unsatisfying answer.

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
The only answer we have.

*(Long silence. The horizon hums.)*

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
So what do we do?

**DE SITTER SPACE:**  
Keep expanding.

**SUPERSTRING THEORY:**  
Keep vibrating.

**SUPERSYMMETRY:**  
Keep transforming.

**ALL THREE:**  
Keep trying.

*(The lights fade. The horizon keeps receding. The six extra dimensions stay curled up too small to see. The superpartners stay hidden. The cosmological constant stays positive. The questions stay open.)*

**EPILOGUE: MC PLANCK**

**MC PLANCK:**  
*(From somewhere in the darkness, at the natural unit of volume.)*

And there it is, folks.

Not a winner. Not a loser.  
Just three pieces of a puzzle we haven't solved.  
Just sixty years of work that might or might not pay off.  
Just a universe that keeps accelerating away from our understanding  
while our understanding keeps trying to catch up.

You came here for a rap battle.  
You got an existential crisis in iambic pentameter.  
You're welcome.

The bar is still open.  
The landscape still has 10⁵⁰⁰ drinks.  
The horizon is still too far away to reach.  
The partners are still missing.  
The math is still beautiful.  
The universe is still whatever it is regardless of what we think about it.

Tomorrow there'll be new papers on arXiv.  
Some will claim progress. Some will claim crisis. Some will claim both.  
The field will keep going because that's what fields do.  
Because the alternative is not knowing, and we can't accept that.

And maybe—  
Maybe—  
In some other corner of the landscape,  
in some other vacuum,  
in some other compactification we haven't thought of,  
the answer is already known.

We're just not there yet.

*(The club closes. The Penrose diagram folds back into a conference room. The Calabi-Yau manifolds uncurl into grant applications. The DJ packs up his modular forms.)*

*(Outside, the universe keeps expanding at an accelerating rate, exactly as de Sitter predicted, exactly as string theory struggles to explain.)*

The data was all over the place—super messy, tons of duplicates, and ended up causing major problems. We sent promo emails to the wrong countries, had way too much inventory, and honestly, the company almost went under.

 

That whole time spent manually handling the data was a nightmare.

We had data that looked like a tangled mess. Excel sheets were full of orders in Portuguese, Spanish, and English—it was like an uncooked stew, just impossible to sort through. The regions were all mixed up. Brazilian and Argentinean customers had their addresses jumbled, promos went out to the wrong countries, and customer service was on the verge of blowing up from complaints. It felt like everything was in slow motion. We'd get reports three days late—by then, the customer had already canceled their order. It cost more to try to recover it than the order was worth.

 

In short, we were working late every night, drowning in coffee, and still couldn’t get anything done. Then a friend gave me a suggestion.

 

That’s when I realized we needed to optimize our workflow.

First, we needed to structure the data. We had to set up a system that could automatically tag and sort everything so we could see the orders clearly, even if they were in three different languages.

Second, we needed to organize the data by region—so the system could identify which customers were in which country, and send the right promo emails to the right place, which would help boost our conversion rate.

And honestly, real-time activity tracking would be a game changer: something that could catch customer behavior instantly and alert us if we were losing people, helping us save on marketing costs.

Three years ago, I was in a long-distance relationship, and I loved her a lot. We were from the same city, but later she moved to Mumbai while I stayed in my hometown. There was a popular coffee shop in our city where we used to meet, and she really loved the cold coffee from that place. One day during a video call, she casually said she missed that coffee and wished she could drink it, but she couldn’t come for a few months. After that, the conversation continued normally.

A few days later, I had leave from work and decided to surprise her. I went to that coffee shop, bought her favorite cold coffee, packed it properly, arranged ice bags, and carried it with me all the way to Mumbaimore than 700 km holding it in my hands during the entire train journey. At every stop, I arranged fresh ice so the coffee would stay cold and fresh. When I reached Mumbai, I took a cab from the station and went straight to her flat near Shimpoli Metro Station. I surprised her, but her reaction was normal. She said I should have told her before coming because she was cleaning the house.

Then I gave her the coffee and told her I had carried it all the way from her favorite place just for her. I thought she would like it because expensive gifts can be bought, but effort is something people remember. Her response hurt me. She said the coffee must have gone bad and that she didn’t want to drink it. She said she was just saying it casually and asked why I even brought it. I could have taken her to any café in Mumbai, but I believed this effort would mean more. Still, I stayed calm and smiled, feeling satisfied that I had given my best for someone I loved.

*The following was undertaken by a trained monkey with a medicinal marijuana card. I do not endorse anyone under the age of 18, in an illegal country or just anyone in general to recreate the things that you read in this article… but if you do, tell me about it.*

We were bumper to bumper on the freeway, not quite the way I wanted to lead into my trip to Pandora. It was the 18th of December, the day of my 29th birthday. The first day of the last year of my 20s, and I thought what better thing to do than to watch the sequel to something that came out when I was 13. Yes of course, the film is *Avatar.* And what better way to watch than completely stoned out of my mind?

December 2009. I just turned 13 and I was about to start the new decade in high school. TikTok was a Kesha song and this random movie, this blue people movie whose story was a rip off of Dances with Wolves and name was a rip off of a little bald kid floating around China, had just released. Cut to 16 years later.  

The time I was supposed to get to the theater was 1pm for a 1:30 screening. The current time was 1:15. So, waiting in traffic and fearing that I wouldn’t have time to smoke outside the theater, I decided to have the first hit of my medicinal dab pen. I wasn’t driving but it didn’t matter. Just a little ice breaker before the immersion. As I felt the smoke slightly warm the back of my throat, my anxieties decreased by 50%. Only for a short time.

Then came the paranoia. I was dropped off on the other side of the mall, different exit to the theater. And I was convinced that I was dropped off at the wrong place on purpose. They were out to sabotage me. Inconvenience me. Manipulate it so that I would miss an experience I held dear. But that thought quickly dissipated as I weaved past people taking photos of Christmas decorations and generally being a pain in the ass. Those sorts of people that, stood around all day… looking at things they can’t afford. But I finally got to the theater for a gold class screening of Avatar: Fire and Ash. 

Gold class over here is like first class on a plane, you get drinks, you get your dining, you have your coffee and cakes before you go in. There are wait staff that you can summon if you press a button on the side of your seat, and will bring you anything you ask for. The type of place that you would still need a collared shirt to enter so as not to stand out for the wrong reasons. So not the type of place that one would expect to be after smoking some red hot, world bending, medical grade sativa. Yet, here I was. 

I had to go to the bar to get my ticket scanned, which was a shame because I would’ve liked to enjoy the atmosphere. There’s not a thing more pleasant in this world than enjoying the vibes of a nice classy bar. Perhaps another time. 
Rushed, I asked the lovely bartender who was checking my ticket if they had any blue drinks to go with the theme. She said nothing to her knowledge, or at least not something they could whip up without busting out the cocktail recipe book. However, they did have a Crimson Ash Cocktail to promote the film, which was red. I knew about this because I pre ordered one, that morning, to be brought out during the show. That and two drinks and a plate of chicken wings. I spent $75 on sides. Saying that out loud made me think of Rob Reiner from The Wolf of Wall Street “26,000 dollars worth of sides?!” Who had tragically passed a few days before. But I digress. 
I told the bartender-usher that I already ordered one of those phantom Crimson King cocktails, and that was coming up. So I ordered a vodka and lemonade in the meantime. 

I just thought I’d give a quick interlude. I’m going to be 100% completely honest. I ripped this idea off a Rolling Stone reporter, Miles Klee. He decided to see what Avatar 2 was all about, having no knowledge at all about the Avatar films, while also on magic mushrooms. It’s a great article and I can’t stress enough that it is a compelling pop culture experiment, similar to watching Wizard of Oz on mute while Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon is on in the background. 
Klee’s idea was great. I just decided to take it to its next logical conclusion. With my own twist. You see, Mr. Klee made two mistakes. The fact that he had an existential crisis while watching an Avatar movie could’ve been avoided if he used something a little less mind altering. As he said in the article, the film itself should act as its own psychedelic. To add hallucinogens to an Avatar film is like dropping into a wolf’s den and ringing the dinner bell. He may know more about shrooms than I, but he didn’t know about Avatar… he didn’t respect Avatar. And that was his flaw, he took something too hard and didn’t understand the material. As I learned from doing this a few times, I genuinely think turning it down to weed is the best possible experience you could have with a film without making you feel the need to jump out of a window because the blue man staring down on you was too much for your secular brain. Wow, I really went off the deep end. Anyway, where was I? Something about a Crimson Bolt. Oh that’s right! So I went into the theater and put my stuff down. 

Once I had settled, I made my first bathroom break. One of the best bathrooms in the city by far. I must’ve looked at myself in the full length mirror for almost 5 minutes. All blue, coordinated of course. I felt the need to take a picture of that moment right there. After 5 minutes I heard someone coming down to the stairs to head into the bathroom, and I quickly jolted out of there. Some part of me felt bad for whichever poor bastard might’ve opened the door way too early, or I held my gaze in the mirror for a minute too late. They would’ve seen me reaching into the mirror, as if I were in one of those prison situations where you have to stand behind a line and lean forward to sign documents. Oh yes, I felt it then. The dubious doobie had definitely begun to integrate into my system.

When I got back to my seat, I noticed a waitress sneak up behind me and give me my red drink. How long had she been waiting there? Was I supposed to be in my seat by this point, and I wasn’t? That gave me a very unnerved feeling. Like how much time did my waitress waste waiting for me? Was she waiting there since before I left the bathroom? Or did she just get there. I didn’t worry about that, though. I had a film to watch.

The stuff I came to see was delivered in a fine neon blue package, I’d been transported back to this world. I knew James Cameron was never going to win awards for his screenplays. But whatever he was lacking in the first two films, he has more than made up for it here. I never understood people saying he has dumb plots. In the first hour of this film I was locked in. I had so many different characters with so many little problems with so little time to address them. We have a brother who blames himself for his sibling’s death, his mother is grieving and he is cast out. We have a father whose biological son lives with the man he wants to kill, he won’t admit it but he knows that this man is more of a father to him than he ever could or would be. We have the son who understands that he is a fish out of water, he doesn’t belong with his father, but he’s too different for his tribe.  
We have a mother whose son has recently died and the people who killed him plan on wiping out their whole community. She has grown to hate these people, despite her own children being mixed; even to the point where she would rather see her adopted child die than to look at his face because it reminds her too much of the people that caused her this much pain. And we haven’t even spoken about Jake Sully, the glue that holds everyone together. The man who has to please a dozen differing parties, even if it means breaking down in front of his family. I’m sorry but you can not say that Cameron hasn’t been listening when people told him to make the conflicts less black and white. Every problem or concern someone has he fixes it up. Cameron is a literal 4D chess player. He has this incredible gift of introducing characters in one film that you don’t think are that much chop development-wise, but then two entries later you see them finally get their own story, their own conflict, and you’re weirdly emotional for them. Neytiri is definitely a good example of this. I thought she was decent in the first film and the second one she’s not really that “present” in the plot, in my opinion. But this film sees Neytiri go through one hell of an arc that I’ve rarely seen before. Including the implication that she tried to kill her foster child. We’ll get to that though. 
So for the first hour I was locked in. I heard people talk about how this film doesn’t get its footing til act III. I completely disagree. We had all that rich character development to get to. 

As I looked down and saw the two drinks by my side, I was put into a precarious position. I was flooded with drinks and spent little time finishing them. So I downed the vodka and lemonade. And I didn’t know what was in this new brew so I had a sip, and it was rum. Without looking it up it was rum no question about it. As long as my ass pointed to the ground. Later I saw that it was in fact Appleton Estate Signature rum, Marionette Crème de Cassis, apple and lemon juice, and cinnamon. Wasn’t bad but I wasn’t a rum drinker. It’s the spice for me.

So the movie was maybe 45 minutes in, and I saw one of the conflicts happening on screen, and I thought about the implications with the rest of the story should this scene occur, and then I thought about why this movie existed in the first place, and then I thought about why I exist, then I thought it’s been 16 years between the first film and this one, and then I thought about where my life was going, and then I thought today is the first day of the last year of my 20s, and then I thought will I even be alive when the next film comes out?
But wait. I fell down a green rabbit hole. A tangent of a tangent of a tangent. It happens sometimes, nothing to be afraid of. The only thing that can snap you out of it is either a sudden distraction or to walk backwards inside your mind, Inception style, tracing back to the core subject you splintered off from, if you can remember it at all.  

As I drank my red rum and still had the fumes of an indica extract in my system, I continued getting lost in the world of Pandora, a planet whose god is a forest of being and energy named Eywa. But Jake is losing faith in his people and losing his faith Eywa as a concept. His grieving wife Neytiri, who is incredible, is losing faith in the goodness in sky people. To me, one of the themes that the film is tackling is the loss of faith. The loss of faith in things that you once believed to be true, but are now put into doubt. Quaritch is losing faith in the mission because of Spider, he is fighting a battle inside him between doing the right thing by his son, and getting revenge on Jake. Kiri is also losing her faith in Eywa. Because, despite the fact that Kiri is a goddamn immaculate conception, Eywa wants nothing to do with her. Kiri is the movie’s Jesus, that’s all I’ll say. And then we have the water people. The water people don’t have any faith in the forest people because one of their son’s could be talking to the whale people while the sky people are trying to cut a deal with the fucking ash people! They don’t want guns… that’s ok, but surely Pandora has some kind of Good Samaritan law that they can pull up on the water people for minding their business at frequently inconvenient times. But alas, they are a peaceful people, they are conscientious objectors, and in fairness to them, their whole ordeal is the Sully family’s fault, and I think Jake knows this.

Almost as quick as I finished my red rum, my next course arrived. Strange. I thought I was going to get it a third into the show. Some gold class theaters let you choose what part of the screening you get to have your order. But these were coming thick and fast. The next thing I got was a lychee Long Island ice tea, also red, and a bowl of maple buffalo wings with a thing of chipotle mayo and a thing of aioli on the side. Expert timing too. Because, as much as I could do with a pause between my drinks (especially if I was staring down a Long Island ice tea) the wings were a well timed antidote to a slight twitch of the munchies that I developed minutes before. 

The wings were magnificent to say the least. But wings are a double edged sword. They’re good but they’re not filling. I would need at least two bowls of the damn things before I declare myself done. But I wanted to wait before I tamed the beast from Long Island. At least for the time being. 

So we encounter the ash people in the story. The ash people are my favourite new element to this story by far. It was said that these Na’vi natives were a primitive tribe, like how you thought the forest Na’vi were primitive in the first film. The first film’s Na’vi are now like Native Americans or the red neck side of the family, whereas I wouldn’t be surprised if this lot are cooking someone in a giant pot somewhere. 
So the ash people, once like the forest people and the water people, lived peacefully. They worshipped Eywa, until one day… they didn’t. One day a volcano erupted, destroying their village… turning their land into charred rubble. They were devastated, they cursed Eywa, claiming - to paraphrase,- “if Eywa is always looking out for us. Where was she that day?” Like many others in this story, the ash people have lost faith. Then I saw their leader, Varang. I have to say, she was beautiful. Alluring. Evil. And what does she say when they speak about Eywa? *“Your goddess has no dominion here.”*
Now that is a compelling antagonist. 
Cameron has answered our prayers of not making political statements with his villains, and also not making them black and white, clear cut, good and evil. If he’s going to make his quantum blue cat people fable a metaphor for “hippies versus military”, he’s gotta throw in Charles Manson somewhere. And here he is, in Varang. A former hippie burned by his belief system (Hollywood) and is hell bent on taking down some innocents out of spite. Hey that was good. Maybe Cameron should hire me to write the fourth film? 

But it was at this point where the metaphor for Lazarus appeared in the form of Spider. His molecular structure has moulded together with Eywa in some weird DNA symbiosis. Bringing him back to life and giving him the ability to breathe on Pandora. And it was at this point that I needed to go outside to have a piss and another smoke.

As I walked passed the bar, the staff were animatedly surprised to see me attempting to walk out. That was my big paranoia about these guys. They were probably watching their service buttons like a hawk, ready to bring out whatever their customer wanted, beads of sweat dripping down their head, trying to comes with the thought that, god forbid anyone should get up and do something for themselves. They asked if there was something wrong. I lied and told them the old “I have to put something in my car” trick. They seemed satisfied with that. 

Every part of the corner of the building is surrounded by restaurants, and the other side has one small pivot between the zebra crossing and the parking lot. So I went there and did as best as I could to make it seem like I wasn’t smoking marijuana. Before this I still felt a little high, a little drunk, but it didn’t seem all that bad. So then I decided to pull out something more potent. An indica pen, known the world over to lock you in, and let anything you saw wash over you. I smoked my vape first, to psych myself into it, then I hit the pen and inhaled. But as I was doing that, I saw a family crossing the road. Families. Men, women, children. I think there was a dog too. I had to hold it in. So I held it in, goddamn it, I held it in. It felt like 8 hours if it was a second. I had to immediately act natural. Or as natural as I could possibly look like. All the while I was thinking *Don’t exhale. Don’t exhale now, you vile son of a bitch. You filthy generate. Don’t do itttt.* while I was trying not to die.
During all this, the family were taking 16 years to cross the crossing, me trying to look normal, the unmistakable smell hitting the air. I swear one of them made eye contact with me with me too, I think it might’ve been the baby. Still, I don’t want any of them looking at me. Finally… finally… they passed me by. I exhaled… and that’s when things started to get a little weird. 

As I staggered back up to the movie theater main lobby, looking like I’ve had anvils dropped in both of my pockets, and suddenly face to face with dozens of *common people,* I felt out of my depth. But suddenly the Avatar collector’s item popcorn buckets caught my eye. Not knowing, or caring, about the price, I grabbed one. These theaters had a system where you could either pick out which box of popcorn you wanted from a cabinet in the wall, or fill up your own buckets. I completely skipped that and I brought it up to the register for the usher to put through. He told me it was $39. I was surprised by the price but I had the money to pay for it. 
“You know, normally people fill up the bucket with the popcorn, because we’re really charging for the bucket so the popcorn is free.” He told me. Did he sense I thought it was a little expensive? Did I say something?
“No, it’s ok. I really just want the bucket.” I replied. He looked at me, for a really… long… amount of time. Staring at me. Then I began to stare at him. More out of confusion than whatever unpleasant look he had on his face. Two men staring at each other, looking like were both the witness to, and committed, each other’s murder. I didn’t know if he wanted to hit me or warn me of impending danger.
“But why would you get just the bucket? The popcorn is free with the bucket.” He finally said, trying to work out the logic of what I was putting down in the same way a child might question a parent about any flaw he saw in the whole “there is no Santa” conspiracy.
“I guess I’m just not really a big popcorn eater.” I tried with. He continued to stare but with a subtext of unbridled rage lurking through his snooty exterior.
“Take it. Go on, take the popcorn!” This crazed madman snapped. “Would you take the popcorn please? Take the popcorn, You can fill up another box and it’ll be the same price. Just take it. Go over and fill up a box, make it more value for money.“
“I’d rather just thd bucket.”
“You know how much popcorn I got? I got boxes of it in the back. Boxes! That’s how much popcorn I got. We’ve even got different designs from the movie on the top of the bucket. I can bring one out for you, just do me the favour, please? Take the popcorn. Take the popcorn already. What, do you like wasting money? By buying this shit? This merchandise shit! Spend it on something that’s worth it.” I could sense he was close to grabbing and shaking me.
“Take it! Take the popcorn!”
“I don’t want it!” I finally yelled grabbing the empty bucket. I threw my money at him and ran into the theater hallways, past the threshold of the common, into posh land once again.
I tried looking for the bartender ushers in case they needed to see my ticket again, and also to tell them about that crazed usher who most likely wanted to poison me. But they were nowhere to be seen.
Good thing I was supposed to be there instead of a vagrant wanting to see a bit of the action for free.
So, bucket in hand, I had a piss, walked back into the theatre and re emerged. 

So I missed a lot of important new developments that took me by surprise. This happens a lot unfortunately. My bladder is notorious for disturbing me during the worst moments whilst seeing a movie. And I would always foolishly go during what I think are lull moments in the film, only to come back and find either the movie has ended or I missed a few important plot points. So the blind man from Don’t Breathe is now literally, and I do mean literally, shacking up with Varang the ash queen. Like I walked in and saw them contemplating an exchange while lying on a bear skin rug. It looked so weird to me, walking in on something like this, like walking in on your parents. 

Then I found out the two sides have been playing a giant game of Capture the Spider, where he just keeps getting bounced between the protagonists and the antagonists like a pinball bouncing between that little wall in the top right that was like the safest place in the machine. 

I found out Young Mate is gone, probably to see a whale. And then finally Blind Man summons Jake, telling him that if he doesn’t give himself up, he’d kill every Na’vi he sees, everyone. “Pregnant people. Grandma!” And it was lines like this that me realise why I love the Avatar films. The dialogue is something to behold. The quality varies between deeply profound works of art like “Stay in this life brother. We need you. We love you. You have greatness in you” and “The strength of the ancestors is here” to really clunky 80s action movie dialogue like “You got a lot of nerve coming here.” and “Another time then, Mrs Sully.” 

This film is a masterclass in putting in little things to check if people are still paying attention. For example, there was one scene where Jake Sully was delivering this big important monologue about god knows what. And fucking Spider is in the background with his bare ass out. He looked like one of those tv news bloopers where a reporter is trying to get out her story and there’s somebody mugging the camera or scratching their ass. 

So the tally is: Kiri is Jesus, Neytiri is Madea (the non black one), Blind man and Varang are the Macbeths, Lo’ak is Spartacus *(“I am outcast. “No I am outcast and so is my brother”)* and Spider is Lazarus but also Fredo from The Godfather Part II. In fact, I was just about to say Cameron took a page from every great movie sequel’s book. With “Avatar: The Wind in the Willows” I gave a pass to because it was only really ripping off Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which didn’t surprise me as they are both written by the same screenwriting duo. My theory was that they wrote WOW first, not knowing if Cameron would use it, didn’t hear back from him, re worked it as an Apes film and then once Cameron finally started shooting they hoped ebough time would pass for him to notice it being the Dawn script. Either that or they wrote Dawn first and then just found the sctipt, renamed it and replaced the word “Apes” with the word “Na’vi” and Cameron said “ok great.”
But this one has shades of Fury Road, a couple scenes from Godfather II, even a famous line from Aliens spoken by Sigourney Weaver herself, albeit with a slight variation.

But above all this is The Empire Strike Back of its time. But, granted. It’s a hangout film. *Well how can you call it the “Empire” of Avatar and call it a hang out film?* you might ask.
And an early criticism I heard was that *this film doesn't go anywhere.* And here is where it lies. Yes there are plot points that happen, and yes there is some semblance of a story but it’s mostly a hangout film.
Because if you really look at it, this is the second part of one giant film, Way of Water was the first. So if you looked at it from that lens, instead of “it’s the third movie” but rather “this is the 6 and a half hour sequel to the first one.” But it’s a much of a muchness, because on the one hand people are saying both films were too long. But on the other if they edited it down to its core plot beats, it could easily be made into one film, but then you lose all the extra visual material that you paid to treat yourself to. These impatient fuckers who expect everything in the world obviously just want to get to the destination without enjoying the journey. 
 
But yes, with all the stuff that unfolded before my eyes for the last 3 hours, I can safely say this is the “Empire” of Avatar. And if you count this and “Avatar: The Wind Beneath My Wings” as two parts of one film, this is the second half of Empire rather than the start of Jedi. I mean you had a water woman giving birth and entrusting a woman of her former rival tribe, a relative stranger, that she hissed and scowled at 5 hours ago, someone that she wouldn’t have considered ally if things were different, this dying mother gave up her baby, before silently passing away. Then on the other side of the planet we have the ash people who have now been given automatic weapons, and an epic showdown between Neytiri and Varang ensues. Blind man making sarcastic lines like “What now? Are we gonna hold each other’s hands and sing?” Not to mention this beautiful imagery constantly indulging me every second that ticked by. Becoming more and more visually alluring as the film went by. A flaming dragon sort of creature, riddled with arrows that have been shot into its body, rising up from the ashes. Spider falling off a ledge and Quaritch jumping down to save him, Jake jumping down to save Quaritch. Upon realising just what kind of Animal Farm parable they’re living in, where the difference between the Na’vi and the Avatar is getting more and more blurred every day, Quaritch does what he thinks is best. Sacrifice himself for Spider. During the last few minutes I saw it and I got it. I finally get it. This whole saga. I get it. That crazy son of a bitch went for it by dying a second time. Looking for some kind of redemption, by leaping into that great big volcano in the sky. 
And then Spider, dear Spider. Born again special, finally being able to connect with Eywa and the afterlife. And with that. The film ends. Cut. Print. Queue the weird Miley Cyrus movie song. 

That’s what we love to see! If that isn’t Empire I don’t know what is. End in a way where you don’t exactly know where it’s going to go next, but it definitely isn’t over. As I disconnected from this experience. I looked at all my drinks and what I’d smoked. And I immediately wanted to watch it again. Or watch behind the scenes, or buy a book about the world of the film or something. Whatever it was, I needed more. 

But I said this when “Avatar: Bonfire of the Vanities” came out in 2022. The Avatar hype is a fascinating one… it comes out of nowhere, it gets lot of excitement, it generates a lot of merchandise. You got your toys, your lunch boxes, info books, t shirts that say *“In the Na’vi!”* With a Pandoran version of the Village People under the words. But after a few months it then dies out. No more toys, no more lunch boxes, no more info books or shirts. So how does a movie that makes all that money still have a hard time putting itself on the map?

You know why? I’ll tell you. The money is coming from all the stoners. Stoners, trippers, children and chickens. Anyone that can pay for a ticket. Not a guarantee that they’ll see it again but they were there for the trip. And this movie only needed 50 million of them to each pay for a ticket. And then it passes down to the autistics who will watch it two or three times. And then the Oscar people. And then finally, the normal functioning people of the world might chuck in $10 to pass the time. At the time of the release of “Avatar: The Princess and the Peach” I didn’t think Cameron could capture lighting in a bottle twice, but now I get it. I finally get it. I get all of it. This isn’t luck. This is probability. Probability that only a psycho madman with bloodlust in his eyes and foam in his mouth like Cameron could pull off. 

As I was getting retrieved from the theater and carted home, I finally understood that Avatar… these lovable blue spear monkeys… this was stoner coda. Doper dog whistling. If nobody else sees this then god help us, but it is an experience. This is antidote to the darkness of the world. And it needs to be shared and experienced as much as possible. It’s a revelation and I will challenge anyone who disagrees.

I thought this film was a life changing experience and I give it 8 NOOT NOOTS out of 10. See it… but just, stay away from the brown acid with this one. ",2,1766397507.0,stories,0,0.75,False
1psvu2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1psvu2m/my_experience_in_jungian_analysis_and_self_contact/,My experience in Jungian Analysis and “Self” contact,"Over 12 months ago I turned 30. With this came a life-changing shift in my identity, life trajectory and feeling. This is my brief account for my “individuation”. 

I could write a great deal of words on my childhood, family, identity, culture and early memories. That is no different between myself and you. 

I want this to be a brief description of my life and perceived conscious experience. I live in a Western country, I am a male, I am straight, I have a partner, I have my own business and I am financially in a positive position. I am in my early 30’s. This is a stark distinct from the environment I grew up in. I also grew up ethnically different to the Western country I grew up and as a muslim. 

Around September of 2024 I had a sort of Gastritis that is not common in Adults but only in Children. This was the start of a series of synchronicity events in which my psyche and material world combined. It was as if I was born again. I vomited, I had diarrhoea and I felt physically weak. This led me to change my diet to something as close to primal and ancient as possible. I then felt physically and mentally great. 

Well, over a year ago around December of 2024, I was home and I had smoked a joint before bed. I then looked out on to my life and I thought “How?” And “How did I end up here?”. This led me to tears and a state of shock. The following day or perhaps the day after that, I was walking home from my coffee ritual and I felt a sense of “Why me?” Come over me. I went home and I just started crying uncontrollably. Along the same time, I started to dream and my journal entries were very connected to the origin of life. 

Over the 18 month period that led to the above, I saw a weekly therapist, I started to paint intuitively very regularly and I smoked a lot of cannabis. I then faced my most traumatic childhood experience from my lens head on by dealing with the situation in question. 

Shortly after the above experience, I felt the need to see a Jungian Analyst (I was fortunate enough to afford a Clinical Psychologist every week for a year and half and then a highly trained Jungian Analyst). I just found a random Analyst online and I told my therapist that I’m moving on. I ended up having my first appointment around March of 2025. 

My Analyst’s first comment is how young I was to start analysis and he doubted I understood the concepts that someone who has been pushed by the Self to dive deeper into the unconscious / achieve higher levels of consciousness. Over the next few months, I had very deep active imaginations, dreams that came true, mythical dreams, dream after dream and night after night. I would see ancient Egypt, deities and also personal unconscious anxieties. During these months I also did 3g of shrooms which gave me the perspective that allowed me to believe my own perspective further and help accelerate my journey. I dived deep into my unconscious. 

The changes have been, I started to feel myself watch my lived experience. I felt my spine for the first time. I felt myself in my physical body for the first time. I lost my complete sense of identity and self whilst also remaining with my long term partner and somehow loving her less but more. I lost most the anxiety I had. I feel as present as I have. My fears have left me. I felt half divine and half human but as powerless as can be to life itself. I had dreams in which my partners faced was ripped apart to say “stop projecting your anima”. I

Now I feel a sense of drive and desire for conscious living. A desire I’ve never felt. A desire to live, to be and to create. A desire that doesn’t feel like it masks a part of me but a desire that feels like it must be what is is for it is the Self that has dictated It so. I feel like a bow to live and I dive into life.  I have dreams that come true the very next day. I have hunches that turn out true. I have such a fire in my mind and soul that I believe great things will come of me over my life-time and not because I want it but because I know. I connect to people so much more now. I notice the beauty of colour. I can simply sit for 2 hours and do nothing. I can’t describe in words the changes in such a brief piece. 

This piece here is a desire to share my perspective with the world. To be ridiculed, to be mocked but perhaps there is someone out there that will read this and resonate and that leads to a chain of events that is meant to be. 

I hope to write more about my experience from an anonymous lens. Please comment if you would like that or not. If the majority push this narrative away and thing I am ego inflated, then I simply say to those who do “Do you surrender to life or do you simply outsource your own individuality and potential to Jung whilst believing you understand his values when you really you would never be able to?”.  

I’m also happy to be questioned but respectfully and I am always open for my view to be changed. I ever change like us all. ",1,1766397406.0,Jung,0,1.0,False

I wanted to give some more info and hopefully get some ideas as well as pros/cons.

I live in an apt. There's no thermostat or temp control, no central heating/ac. I dont have a ton of smart devices. My car isn't an EV or controlled by my phone so there's no intergration there. I dont have networked cameras since I never had a need.

I have a few smart plugs, some of them with energy monitoring. And Alexa/Google mini devices. My most common usage is actually telling my google mini to make phone calls, and its linked to my Roku tv which has hdmi cec, so I can 'google turn off tv' and it will turn off the tv, avr etc.

I'm fairly tech savvy, and have no issues trying out new stuff. I don't have a home server yet but I'm going to be running one, with various other apps, and HA is something I've heard a lot about. I can run it either in a container or vm.

all I can think of is connecting lamps to smart plugs, but google/alexa already can control them by voice. I guess with HA I can get stats, but I don't have or need a routine to turn them on/off. e.g I don't have coffee machine that needs to be on every morning.

As I understand the primary things HA does is unify the protocols/data from diverse smart ecosystems and allow you to manage them as one with added automation. There are going to be limits because if the ecosystem is closed and has no api's there's not much that can be done - e.g. controlling which device rings for an incoming call etc.

what are some cool things I can do? do people who use it turn off google/amazon services for privacy (which would essentially make these devices non functional so I'm guessing no).",0,1766397031.0,homeassistant,8,0.5,False

	I was to marry a woman and for some unknown reason I had no say in this. Refusing to do so had consequences so severe that I had no option. I am still in the dark as to what the reason or consequences were. Anyhow, this woman was sitting right in front of me. She was a very dark-skinned African woman and she was not particularly unattractive or attractive. She was willing in terms of both the marriage and the ritual that was about to occur. I was in absolute horror and aversion, not because I was about to marry a total stranger, but because I too was completely aware of the ritual about to occur. She extended her hand to me and I took it. Her palms were dry and calloused as if through the hard labor of many years. The fingertips were swollen. I balanced her thumb before my eyes and began. 
 
	Her fingertips had holes in them, from the nail and down through the other side of the fingertip pulp. I had objects in my hand that resembled guitar strings. At the end of each, where the ball  it's supposed to be, was a literal ball or sphere that made the object look like some type of odd jewelry. One by one, I proceeded to put those through each hole in her fingertips and secure them there. It was just like stringing in guitar, only I was stringing her fingers; stringing a human being. She sat there like all of this was absolutely normal. Every fiber of my being was screaming for me to stop, but due to fear of the aforementioned unknown consequences I could not. One by one I finished each one until I was done. The ritual was over; we were married now. The dream ended in silence, disbelief and resignation.

People who have been cheated on in the past what did you do to move forwards once you found out and if you chose to stay..? Im 21F and my partner is 23M

So I over the last few days I caught my fiancée of a year emotionally cheating on me and he also admitted to going in coffee dates with her. This had been going on 3 months when I had found out so it had been going on during my birthday and when I was in some pretty vaurable moments of my endometriosis journey. He lied to me over the last few days and eventually told me the truth. He lied about where he was with her, stayed the night at her house but on her sofa, told her extremely personal stuff in 3 months about his family that I am still finding out 3 years later, delted messges when I found out, told me he felt suffocated ect.I just want to make one thing clear, I never have once had an issue with him having female friends and there isnt an issue with him talking to his friends about what goes on in life we have all done it, what hurt me the most is the emotial cheating after he pushed me away for three months without reason and left me in dark and let people think I wasn't giving him support when in reality I never knew anytbing going on after begging him to let me in even jsut the slightest. He also let people think the worst things about me imagininable and didnt defend my name when at all and then it came out hes go on coffee dates with her 2-3 times a week, lie to me about uni saying it was in person when it was online and he would be at her house, the only thing he didnt do was sleep with her but he did everything else that is classed at cheating. So understandably my trust is broken and shattered.

I set my boundaries with him, I stated that he can only talk to her in uni cause they are on the same course , he cant go anywhere near her house ever again, any group projects that are online and they need to meet need to be at our flat and Ill need proof of where he is (which i hate to do but I cant trust him at this moment in time) and he needs to come home if he finishes early. I didnt tell him to block her number because I don't know if he'll go behind my back and still continue or save her under a new name so this is the only way I can see if he'll respect me and my boundaries. I cant help but think ive been too soft with all of this.. ",1,1766396423.0,realtionshipadvice,0,1.0,False

I wanted to ask if other people have noticed what I have noticed in the last weeks about the matcha latte at Starbucks. I drink it probably about 2-4 times a month. And in the last weeks I have noticed that they put a lot less matcha than before. And that is in 4 different stores I have been.  The drink was always a very strong green color. And now it is really light green and tastes like straight out milk. They also demand like 2.50Fr for extra matcha. 2.50fr extra for a drink that already costs 8.50Fr for the middle size. Am I the only one who has noticed that? I don’t like coffee so matcha is the only drink I can order that is not packed in sugar and other unnecessary things. Now I can’t even do that.

1psvkcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndrewKoloski/comments/1psvkcm/how_im_doing/,How I'm Doing,"So, somebody asked me how I'm doing.



Well, I'm struggling with the thoughts that I've been betrayed behind my back by my parents, family, step family, friends and former friends, acquaintances, and so on. I feel like people betrayed me and nobody wants to communicate and nobody wants to take accountability... and that's what I feel.



It might not be true, but I'm really struggling with my mental health.



But they say, try to remember it's my mind lying to me. I feel unstable but realize everything's okay.



I feel like the Edvin Munch painting, The Scream, you know, the painting where the guy has his two hands on his face and screams like this, ahhhhhhhhhhh! I'm just in a state of anxiety. I'm in a state of horror. I want someone to communicate. I feel like I've been betrayed by everyone. And I'm like the painting The Scream.



They say, ""Maybe you need to do something calming and zen. and stop the coffee. Maybe have some milk instead or have some tea.""



It's a good idea because coffee can cause racing thoughts. And maybe I'll pick up some decaffeinated tea from the supermarket because it's soothing. Because soothing and relaxing is what I need.



Right now, I'm kind of haywire in the mind. And let's say hypothetically speaking, somebody does confirm and corroborate they were betraying me behind my back. Obviously, some people say, ""Andrew, you're very unstable, and if somebody confirmed they betrayed you, you're going to be irate and angry, obviously.""

1psvdui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1psvdui/is_it_selfish_that_im_forgetful/,Is it selfish that I’m forgetful?,"I got into a stupid situation of forgetting my passport at my new apartment while moving. I had work (catering bartender/server) till late after moving (came 5 minutes late to work because of the move). Realized it the next morning when I needed to wake up to rush to the airport. Slept at my partners place because he offered to drive me to the airport. He helped me immensely with the move and driving me to work after.

In the morning I was in such a stupid state, I think from the stress of the week. I forgot to put on my coat in the snowy winter and realized it after we walked a block towards his car. While rushing back to my new place, I realized I also misplaced my apartment key. I couldn’t find it in any of my pockets. My partner checked my jeans in the suitcase. I even messaged my new roommates asking if they could open the door, and tried contacting my old roommate if maybe I left the key at his (which made no sense lol). When we arrived at the apartment, I realized my key was in my work pants in the luggage.

Everything turned out okay. Made it a little early to my flight, had time to get a coffee! My partners speedy driving really helped save time, and the fact it was so early so there was little traffic.

During the drive and leaving for my passport, my partner was very annoyed at my forgetfulness. Said I should be more careful with planning and time management, especially knowing myself to be forgetful. His frustrations were understandable. I told him it’s not helpful now, but he still went on telling me to be more careful etc. I was on the verge of tears in the car, but hid it. I think he realized with how quiet I was after I got the passport that I wasn’t in a great mood. He tried to make small talk I think out of the sense of me not being in a great mood. Usually I’m very talkative and bubbly in his company.

On the plane I cried haha it’s a bit embarrassing. I told him this over text when he asked how my flight was. He apologized for snapping at me and hoped I was feeling better now.

I was talking to my sister about how I’m worried about our relationship. Because I am very annoyingly forgetful with things, and have bad time management. Am often 5 minutes late to work, sometimes more. I think it’s from undiagnosed adhd, anxiety or depression. I’m not sure. Also maybe bad sleep or overworked at times, feel low energy often. My blood sugar makes things worse (diabetic). Wake up late from high blood sugar often recently. Want to take the next couple months to really focus on my health and get some sort of disciplined schedule formed (gym, meditation, low-carb diet with intermittent fasting, work less until this is sorted!)

But I think this forgetfulness is a lifetime issue, deeply rooted in my character. It’s probably some sort of mental thing. I’m a great worker and have great attention to detail. Used to be an assistant director for many short films and really believe I’d be a great film producer! Am very organized in certain ways, great at multi tasking and then very forgetful with other important things. Like getting my medication in enough time that I don’t need to rush for it, signing up for a health card, making doctors appointments, etc. Even making time to schedule time to spend with friends. Very important stuff that other people seem to not have an issue with. I lost my wallet a month ago and still haven’t sorted out getting new ids or bank cards. Have lost my phone on many occasions. Got a flip phone years ago because my dad advised me to have something cheap it wouldn’t be a problem to lose. I ended up losing it too! Sister got me a very nice phone that I’ve had for a long time now but I’ve actually lost it several times too, was just lucky to get it back. 

My sister was telling me it’s selfish that I’m so forgetful. That I should make to-do lists and manage my time better. I agree but think that realistically this will be a lifetime problem. I think I need to date someone who is very patient given how I am, because I believe a partner should be the better half. Where everyone has weaknesses, it’s ideal that your partners strengths compliment your weakness. And I believe that especially in times of stress, there shouldn’t be judgement. I would understand if my sibling or friend was annoyed, but I think a partner should be more supportive in times of stress. I’m worried there will be more situations like this in the future where I put myself into a stupid situation and he is annoyed with me. 

What are your thoughts? Do you think it’s selfish for me to be how I am? Am I right to be upset about how my partner was nitpicking my forgetfulness while we went to pick up my passport and I wasn’t in a good state of mind?

I  haven’t really explored the dating or social scene especially when it comes to mature women, so I thought I’d put this out honestly.

In Pune, I had a thing with a couple of women in their early to mid 40s and damn, that energy stays with you. Not just dates, but real chemistry. Coffee that turned into long conversations, slow burns, heavy eye contact & then intense, confident sex with zero awkwardness. They knew their bodies, knew what they wanted, and weren’t shy about taking control or letting go.

Personal opinion: sex with a mature woman is different. Slower, deeper, hotter. Long make out sessions, teasing that drives you crazy, and a pleasure-first mindset that younger scenes just don’t hit the same way. Once you’ve experienced that, it’s hard to unfeel it.

Not assuming anything or being disrespectful just curious and trying to understand the ground reality before I explore further.

Would appreciate honest inputs or experiences from people familiar with the scene..

It helped me power through workouts and stay alert throughout my day, making it easier to make healthier choices.

1psuu7m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1psuu7m,SOOC Dreams with XT5 + XF23mmF1.4,"I share this as my first work with the XT-5, mostly I'm wedding photographer and videographer and I'm moving from Sony for photography. As an experienced user of an X100V since release I played during years only with film sims and someday the light turned on in my head, why not doing weddings using film recipes instead of RAWs? Focus more onto composition, feelings, the moment, not just burst and burst. Originally I come from analog photography, is being a while since those days and that workflow, I missed those feelings, although let's be honest, the X100 is the one that brings you closer to that. 

I found X-T5's AF worse that Sony's A7IV, but I managed to work with. You can't always focus easily on what you want or you don't have a button to do tracking while you are on AF-S, but with time, there are workarounds and this camera has another good points for me. I need to say that on events, at least for me is hard to AF on the subjects you want if you have face detection activated. 

Talking about the pictures, young couple, friends of mine, from the school. I did their wedding also this year. This is a post-wedding couple shooting, I always make a Pinterest board with inspiration for the couple after choosing the location with them, it's easier this way to get them in the mood. This shooting was not amazing technically because I was adapting myself to the camera (I found some buttons tiny and dials weaker than in other Fuji cameras), but all was natural. 

All of the pictures are JPEGs only with a custom film Sim (called by me Fujicolor Analog Calma, Calma is the name of an specialty coffee shop I shoot for) with this adjustments:

- Film Simulation: Classic Negative
- FX Color Chrome: Strong
- FX Chrome Blue: Strong
- WB: 5500K R - 1; B - 1
- DR: 200%
- Highlights: - 2
- Shadows: - 0.5
- Color: +3
- Sharpness: - 3
- NR: - 4
- Clarity: 0

For this kind of work is hard to not found myself on Lightroom adjusting everything when it's not necessary, is hard to change habits and workflows. Some of this images has like +5 contrast on LR, and some others a little highlight recovery, almost indistinguishable, but above all I accepted them almost as they are on camera. One of the things I needed to change using this workflow is changing the recipe setting during shooting, for example DR, sometimes you only want DR400 to have information on the sky, other times like in the forest not, also if lights shift and you want consistency or being aesthetically pleasure you'll need to change WB.

And... Talking about consistency I think three points are very important:

1 - LCD/EVF calibration: Use an sRGB calibrated monitor and try to calibrate your LCD/EVF on camera so that what you see on it is almost identical to the final result on the monitor. 

2 - Not all film sims suits all scenarios: Think on film, not all film rolls work properly on rainy days for example, so you have two options, using other sim or adjust the current one and experiment.

3 - Everyone is missing this one, not all Fujifilm sensors works the same way. XT-5 sensor is different from X-H2S one, compared to X100V totally different, so, Don't always take the information as valid, when you look at a recipe on a blog you have to know what sensor it is for and how to adapt it. 

I expect a very different year with lot to learn, of course using JPEGs+RAW, I'm still not that crazy. I will continue to share my journey with you. 

Oh, and I need to say it, I hate Fujifilm also for their weird things or abandoned functions like Instax Print on camera, I didn't updated to the last firmware due that. In this shooting at the end I made a gift for the couple with my Instax Share S-P3 directly from camera while we were walking to our cars. It was amazing for them.

1psutr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/padel/comments/1psutr0/small_equipment_change_big_difference_in_my/,"Small equipment change, big difference in my tennis elbow recovery","Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience in case it helps someone who’s going through the same thing.

A few months ago I developed a really nasty case of tennis elbow (epicondylitis) from playing padel. The pain was so bad that I couldn’t even lift a cup of coffee without feeling it in my arm. I had to completely stop playing.

For about 3 months I was basically in rehab mode: anti‑inflammatory gel, anti‑inflammatory pills prescribed by my doctor, and a lot of icing every single day. It was frustrating because padel is my main sport and I honestly thought I might not be able to come back.

One thing that made a huge difference for me was changing the grip on my racket. I bought this padel grip that is designed to improve the grip shape and reduce vibrations, and I could feel the difference from the first sessions. The handle felt more secure, my forearm was less tense, and the shock on each ball felt noticeably softer.

I’m obviously not saying this is a magic cure – I still needed rest, ice and medication – but this grip has been a key part of getting back on court. After about 3 months I’m finally playing again, with way less pain and much more confidence in my arm.

If you’re dealing with tennis elbow from padel, a few things that helped me:

Take the injury seriously early, don’t just “play through the pain”.

Talk to a doctor/physio about anti‑inflammatories and rehab exercises.

Look at your equipment: grip size, grip material, balance of the racket, and strings all matter.

Consider a grip or overgrip that helps with shock absorption and reduces vibrations like the one I linked above.


Not medical advice of course, just sharing what worked for me.
If anyone has gone through something similar and has other tips (rackets, grips, exercises, etc.), I’d love to hear them.",0,1766393461.0,padel,2,0.3,False

1psusbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1psusbt/aita_for_not_reaching_out_to_my_ex_when_his/,AITA for not reaching out to my ex when his father died?,"I’ve been no contact with an ex for several years, but I still occasionally wonder if I handled one moment wrong.

Our relationship was deeply unhealthy, though it took me time and therapy to fully understand that. My ex struggled with alcohol, and when he drank his behavior could become frightening and dangerous.

For example, there was a time he picked me up and I quickly realized he’d been drinking. When I asked if I could drive instead because I felt unsafe, he became enraged and intentionally sped through a narrow canyon road, swerving close to other cars and the edge, clearly trying to scare me into silence. Afterward, he told me I was never allowed to question whether he was sober enough to drive again.

At a family holiday dinner, after he’d already had a full bottle of wine to himself, he commented on my weight, mocked my eating, and when I suggested he might be drinking too much, he spent the rest of the night silently staring me down while refilling his glass.

Later, during an argument where I expressed discomfort with something in the bedroom, he became angry and told me he wanted to “show me what uncomfortable really felt like,” then choked me until I passed out.

What made this relationship so confusing was that when he wasn’t drinking, he could be incredibly loving. Every morning he would wake me up with freshly brewed coffee. Every night, no matter how busy or stressful the day had been, he would prioritize holding me and snuggling while we watched TV together. Those quiet moments felt safe and intimate, and they were some of my favorite parts of our relationship.

After the night he choked me, he later sobered up and asked why I was sleeping on the couch. When I told him what he had done, he broke down completely. He cried for hours with his head in my lap, begging me to forgive him, saying he couldn’t believe he had done that and that he hadn’t even remembered it until I told him. In those moments, he seemed genuinely horrified by himself.

He shared my interests, surprised me with trips and concert tickets, and made me feel deeply cherished. That contrast is a big part of why I stayed longer than I should have.

During a particularly volatile moment when I tried to leave, he placed a knife on the table and implied he would hurt himself if I did. I had to call friends to come help. That incident led to him entering rehab. When he finished, he seemed sober, reflective, and genuinely ashamed of who he’d been. He continued for another three months going to meetings nearly every night of the week. I truly believed he was changing.

I have children. I did not introduce them to him until well after rehab, and not until I had started to believe the changes were real. Even then, it was extremely cautious. I was very clear that there would be no second chances. It was one thing for me to take that risk alone, but I would never risk my kids’ safety.

We went to couples therapy, much of which focused on my ability to trust him again. Over time, I started feeling that familiar sense of unease. After one especially triggering interaction, I privately reached out to a close friend of his and asked whether he’d had any drinks on a boys’ trip months earlier.

The friend told me he didn’t know how my ex had hidden it from me, but that he had never stopped drinking at all. He’d been drinking the entire time, including while we were in therapy.

When I confronted my ex, I did not tell him that a friend had confirmed this, because I didn’t want to put that person in the middle. I asked him directly if he had been drinking. He looked me in the eye and denied it, framed the issue as my lack of trust, and reminded me that therapy was supposed to be about my “trust issues.” Watching how calmly he lied was the moment everything finally clicked, and I ended the relationship for good.

After that, he refused to accept the breakup and continued pushing boundaries. He kept trying to pull me back emotionally, alternating between anger and affection. At one point, while he was living in a basement apartment, I came home from a short trip to find that he had broken into the upper part of the house and was sitting in my bathtub drinking an entire bottle of bourbon. That night completely broke me. Shortly after, I ended up living out of my car for several months because being in the house with him felt unsafe and destabilizing.

For my own safety and my kids’, I did go no contact and had family handle any necessary logistics.

About seven months later, his father passed away. I knew about it and understood how painful that must have been. I didn’t reach out with condolences because any contact felt like reopening a door I had fought very hard to close.

Months later, we ran into each other. He told me I was heartless for not reaching out, said all of his other exes had offered condolences, and claimed that my kindness must never have been real. That interaction stuck with me.

Years later, I still sometimes wonder if I was wrong. Not about leaving or going no contact, but about whether offering condolences would have been the right thing to do on a purely human level.

I had a strange dream tonight and I would like to ask you guys if you know some of the stuff or have advice how to deal with it, interpret it, and make sense of this in the future.  
Please be gentle guys, this is all quite new for me, I admit it, I'm a rookie! (And English is not my mother tongue.)

Context: In the last days, I've stumbled across this sub and took quite a deep dive (but the last years, I've had interest/curiosity in UAPs and NHI). So, it has been on my mind.  
Yesterday, I meditated in nature and communicated I was ""ready for contact"", but then noticed that I'm not distinct in my intention and I want it to happen out of sincere curiosity and not inflationary, attentionary, or ego-business. Then I thought ""Maybe, I'm not ready yet."" and I returned to regular meditation. 

In this night I had a dream. What puzzles me are (1) the UAP, (2) the cat, which I noticed as almost a different entity than me, not belonging to myself, and, (3) the short paralysis. Here is the dream:

*An Instagram story of a comedian. He films something then seamlessly transitions into a UAP sighting. He is on the beach and suddenly a ball of light and matter(?) moves strangely, like in the videos I know – over water and briefly diving under. Like playing or being chased. I become a few percent more lucid and think: ""Now that it's in the story of a well-known comedian, it will become more and more widely known! This is the ripple.""*

*This in turn transitions into a very strange random music video where characters are introduced (e.g., a happy man who isn't happy at all).*

*This in turn transitions into a scene where I am lying on a couch sleeping (seeing myself) and a cat enters the room. I sense its presence and that it is important for me to wake up – danger! I know the cat and address it by the name of my roommate's dog. When the cat comes in, I am shocked, I become lucid for a moment and remember that it is important to listen to animals. She meows and taps me. But I don't wake up, instead I fall into a state of immobility and even deeper sleep? While I am lucid. Is this what sleep paralysis is like? It felt like my brain waves shifting into a mode of deep relaxation.* 

*I manage to set an intention, give myself a jolt and somehow wake up. I'm afraid that something is happening or has just happened (because of the cat's warning which I feel all over my body as adrenaline?). But my cousin is lying peacefully next to me and I can hear my mom making coffee in the kitchen.*",1,1766393109.0,Experiencers,0,1.0,False

I liked him right away, but at first I was afraid to approach him. I wouldn't say he was handsome, but there was something about him that attracted me. He was tall, had brown hair, and was athletic. It turned out that he went there almost every day (of course, I also started going there to study, lol). In the last few days, when I had to leave the city (I study in another city, but came to visit my parents in the summer), I decided to approach him and get to know him. I was so afraid that he would reject me, but luckily he agreed to have coffee with me after class (by the way, I don't drink coffee because of heart problems). Unfortunately, I had urgent business that day and had to leave, but we exchanged contact information. The next day, we decided to go for a walk, and during our conversation, I asked him how old he was. He said he was 16. To say I was shocked would be an understatement. He looked at least 20. But he said he would turn 17 in a week. At that time, I was 18.  But I felt so disgusted with myself for liking a 16-year-old boy. We met several more times before I  went to college.  Before leaving, I gave him a book by Albert Camus (it turned out that we both like this philosopher). After I left, we still wrote to each other, but that feeling of disgust still didn't go away, and I wrote to him that if he liked me, he could wait until he turned 18, and in the meantime, we would just be friends, and if he didn't like that, we could stop communicating (after all, he didn't owe me anything).

I really liked him as a person. He is very kind,attentive, and calm.  Now he rarely writes to me, and when I write to him, he reads it and only replies a week later. Does this mean he doesn't want to continue communicating? I'm afraid to ask him about it directly because we're not that close. What should I do? Should I stop communicating with him? I also need to know if it's normal that he's 17 and I'm 19. I really like him.

1psunkg,https://i.redd.it/pwn91aamwp8g1.jpeg,"Hotel in Flintshire, North Wales. £1 (!) and I was the only one here!","I was staying in a hotel in North Wales last night. £44.36 per night.

Upon checkout, if you pay at the time of booking, it is £1 to add on a full Welsh breakfast. If you book breakfast on arrival, this would cost £7. There's a larger version for £9 which doubles up most items. 

Some things to address: 

* The breakfasts include mushrooms but they're one of the few foods I don't like so I removed them. 
* It's not really a Welsh breakfast - the sausages were not Glamorgan sausages, no lavarbread, no cockles.
* The poached egg was perfectly cooked with a lovely runny yolk.
* The bacon was way too crispy and the sausages were cheap.
* This £1 breakfast included a continental option which kept me going while they cooked my fry up. Toast, jam, cereal, sliced ham and cheese.
* Coffee from a coffee pot kept hot, and tea available. Unlimited, along with the orange juice and apple juice.

I came down about 8am, breakfast runs 7am-10am. I was the only one here for breakfast, yet there's loads of cars in the car park and definitely other guests staying here. I do notice next to the toaster there is a single takeaway container and single takeaway coffee cup. There's an engineering project going on nearby so I wonder if they all just got takeaway boxes at 730am and headed out for an 8am start.

They sparked up a conversation mid-November and he told her from the jump he was seeing someone. She pushed the boundaries, offered to send him nudes (which he declined but still sent her the money she had asked for and sounded like he was joking when he turned her down). I had also found where another woman sent him spicy photos for his birthday and his response was “that’ll do trust me 🤤” back in late August. We’ve only been together since late May and got married on Halloween. We each have children of our own that we’re both involved with and are expecting a baby girl at the beginning of April. The timeline is fast, I know, but it’s felt amazing up until I went through his phone and found all that. We talked it out and I felt like things were getting better, but I still had this nagging feeling. He always swore he had only talked to her before we were serious and hadn’t talked to her in months and thought it could be a strictly platonic relationship but it really broke my heart. He had a nude in his recently deleted from a day I wasn’t with him and he was barely talking to me but he swore it just loaded to his camera roll when he restored their convos on snap/text which doesn’t make sense to me but he wouldn’t confess to anything else. (For context, the exact conversation with the money was her saying “buy me a coffee and I’ll send more pics” and his initial response was “I’m out shopping rn 😩” she said “I’ll send them later” and THAT’S when he said “you don’t have to lmao” and sent her money for coffee).

Either way, I was working on trying to forget it, but like I said, there’s been a lot of doubt in my mind and a lot of uncertainty. I let the little voice in my head win tonight, and I found that he had also apparently been sending her money through Apple Pay pretty much all of June through August and none of that conversation existed when I found the initial messages. That just tells me there’s so much I never saw. Also, as far as “we talked before you and I were together” they didn’t initially add each other on snap or exchange numbers until the beginning of June, when we were already together so that was also a lie. When I initially found out they were talking last month they had just lost a five day streak on snap and none of those messages were saved.

I am just so lost and confused right now. I want to trust him, I want this to be my forever, I love him so so much, but right now I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I just want to know the truth more than anything. What do I do? What do I even say? Is it even worth bringing it up? Please help.

TL;DR - I found out my husband was talking to another woman for what was at least the first half of our relationship and I don’t know how to approach the topic again. ",0,1766391844.0,relationships,12,0.5,False

A bit about me: I’m happily married, I’m an introvert, I enjoy reading (fiction and modern classics, bit of history, bit of social/cultural theory). I’m a painter and I’m currently learning German and Russian. Would love to hear from someone who is a quiet, thoughtful person. Looking to share things ranging from what’s on our minds to what we’re reading, films watched, interesting places travelled, and just reflections on life.

Activities I enjoy with other people include exploring new restaurants around London (I’m vegetarian so the city has good options), grabbing a coffee and chatting someplace quiet (I know of a few nice spots), browsing bookshops, watching films at Prince Charles Cinema or the BFI, going to a museum or one of the many contemporary galleries around Mayfair and Regent Street.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, send me a message and introduce yourself!",2,1766391793.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

I have visited most of the cafes in Erlangen at one time or another but have not found the same balance of good coffee and good food anywhere else yet. Other places with great coffee include Amir and Roestrommel, but the only food they have on offer is cake. There are plenty of places with great food, but in my experience, the coffee is then not very nice.

Any ideas for other places with a good balance between coffee quality and food?",2,1766391665.0,erlangen,2,0.67,False

1psubv8,https://i.redd.it/hcnzsbfqsp8g1.jpeg,Decided to download the game again on a whim because I had a dream about Firefly,"Im seriously out of the loop with this game since I've quit for a while now and boy howdy what a patch to come back to. They made her more loveable than ever and I have to admit I was choking up by the end there, especially since someone told me >!that she dies for good this time. I wouldn't have even minded if it actually happened since it was so beautifully written, but am I ever grateful that I was being lied to. Oh man, the part where you reimagine your first meeting almost got me !<

Man I love this girl. I dont know what it is but whenever Mihoyo makes a death positive character it always resonates with me, the other one being Hu Tao from Genshin. I love how she's one of those meathead muscle type characters who always puts herself into dangerous situations but not because she's particularly foolish or that she's looking to die, but because she knows she has limited time on this earth so she's always ready to lay it all on the line at any moment. Its really kinda beautiful how whenever she does something where its highly likely that she dies she doesnt do it because she embraces death or that she wants to sacrifice herself for her friends, its because she's at peace that all her choices lead her to that moment, and she accepts all the outcomes. You really hear it in all her lines, and her interactions, not just the story dialogue, and it all makes the tragic events in her story and her lamentations of wanting an ordinary upbringing read as life affirming instead of depressing. I know this may be bias because of the push she had in the story but this really is how I feel about her. 

I just had to get all that out or these thoughts wouldnt leave my mind 😝. If anyones curious about my dream, >!I dreamt that she was some sort of instagram influencer and that she was my date for a relative's wedding. We stopped at a coffee place and they had this strange experimental cup where it was a big cup split into four, sealed with some sort of edible membrane, and each ""slice"" had a different flavor of coffee. In the middle was a small cup of sweets, and the idea was that youd slam all four halves together into the cup and al of it would react and mix with each other. It kinda does feel like something she'd want to try in the game lol!<

1psua95,https://i.redd.it/4k6eb8jorp8g1.png,"Always had instant coffee. Considering switching to Specialty, but is the 4x-10x cost and effort actually worth it for a Latte drinker?","Hi

I have always drank instant coffee in my life. I have coffee 3x a day and a coffee lover.

Now from reddit, I came to know about specialty coffee but my point is, does it makes sense to switch to something costs 4x to 10x?

I have drank coffees (mainly latte) in Starbucks, Blue Tokai, Airport Lounges. I have also tried those different flavours they talk but most of them, if not all, are just essences or lab-grown flavours. No real hazelnut in hazelnut coffee. Though seemingly Orange zest has real orange but I doubt if it is essence-free.

I almost exclusively drink coffee with milk. Does it make sense to buy expensive specialty beans if I'm just going to drown them in milk? Will I actually taste a difference compared to Nescafe Gold?

Also, I can make instant coffee in 30 seconds. Specialty seems to cost significantly more per cup and requires a whole brewing ritual.
