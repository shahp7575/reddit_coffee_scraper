1r3o1uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiBuilders/comments/1r3o1uf/i_was_a_fulltime_idea_validator/,I was a full-time idea validator,"I see tons of posts about ""idea validation"" and ""validate my idea."" You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant.** Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use **Miro**
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use [**Landwait.com**](http://Landwait.com)
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use **Google Docs**
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Us**e Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.**

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**

After this comes the pricing topic. If you want me to cover that in the next post, please let me know.",1,1770986233.0,AiBuilders,0,1.0,False

I knew reading was the key to growth, and I felt guilty every time I looked at my unread stack. I was ""intellectually aware"" that I needed to learn, but I couldn't find the friction-less way to actually *do* it.

I finally stopped trying to force myself to read 50 pages a night and switched to a ""Micro-Learning"" morning routine using Headway. Here’s the specific habit that shifted me from ""wishing I was smarter"" to actually feeling the growth:

Instead of scrolling through news or social media while my coffee brews (which usually just spikes my cortisol), I open a 15-minute summary of a book I’ve always been intimidated by.

The trick to making it FEEL real: Don't just read the summary. For the last 2 minutes, I pick one specific insight from the ""Key Ideas"" section and visualize exactly how I will apply it to a conversation or task I have scheduled for that afternoon.  
  
Example: This morning I read *Atomic Habits*. Instead of just ""knowing"" about habit stacking, I spent two minutes visualizing myself putting my gym shoes next to my toothbrush.

When you see the direct line between a 10-minute summary and a real-world action you're about to take, the ""magic"" happens. You stop feeling like you're ""skimming"" and start feeling like you're actually upgrading your brain in real-time.

If you struggle with the ""guilt"" of not reading enough, try the 15-minute morning window. It’s hard to finish that first cup of coffee and not feel like you’ve already won the day!",1,1770985914.0,GuiltTrip,0,1.0,False

WEBSITE: hiraedu. com, WhatsApp: +12136359834

Hey everyone! I wanted to give back to this subreddit since I got some great tips and advice here. Yesterday, I passed the California Real Estate Exam on my first attempt after about two weeks of focused studying—so here’s everything I did and what worked for me.

I used CEShop for the pre-licensing courses. It’s very repetitive and not interactive at all—lots of reading. You get 6 months to complete all 3 required courses. After that, it’s $23/month/course to keep access for up to 1 year. If you don’t finish within a year, you lose everything. So don’t procrastinate!

While finishing my last course, I got fingerprinted via LiveScan ($60). As soon as I received my course certificates, I applied for both the exam and license at the same time. The DRE took about 3–4 weeks to process my application. I was on vacation during this time, so I didn’t study (but I imagine this is the perfect time to study lol).

I did exam prep using CompuCram. I chose it over other options like PrepAgent mainly because of the 100% money-back guarantee if you don’t pass. My first Pre-Assessment score: 38% lol. CompuCram breaks topics down into the same sections used by the DRE. I started with Disclosures (heavily tested), then worked through the others. 

Every time I got a question wrong, I’d use ChatGPT to explain it, test me on it, and help me understand the context. This really helped. I took about 7 simulated exams, scoring over 80% on three of them (that’s the threshold for the guarantee money back). I also listened to the PrepAgent Real Estate Podcast on Spotify, but otherwise didn’t use any other study materials.

Right before the test, my readiness score on CompuCram was 80.

I took the test in Oakland. It fills up fast, so schedule early. The building was nice and light security check upon entering. Parking next door is $8/hour. They have lockers for your belongings and check your arms (for writing I think) and pockets. We didnt get a whiteboard or calculator —they just gave us a mouse for the test.

The questions on my exam were wordy and covered a wide range of topics. The key to CompuCram (or anything) is: don’t just memorize questions, learn the concepts. It got quite specific, so know the concepts and then some. While taking the test, I was honestly a bit nervous, a lot of it became process of elimination. 

At the end, they gave me a printout that said:

“Scores are temporarily unavailable. Check the portal.”

From what I’ve heard:

* If you fail, the paper says so directly.
* If you pass, you get the “temporarily unavailable” message.

Sure enough, about an hour later, I checked the portal and saw that I PASSED! 

Below is all the notes I took. Posting it here because I hope it helps someone here too! 

And of course tipping culture has me adding in a way to tip lol: If these helped please consider buying me coffee : [buymeacoffee.com/sarahval98n](http://buymeacoffee.com/sarahval98n)

I mean, I work out as well, and I have my issues online dating just like the rest of these fit guys.

Now, I'd see a guy occasionally mention that he needs to lose some weight, which I can understand the response of needing to ""lift bro"" and such.

But to do it under the assumption that the guy is NOT working out, is cringe.

I have a heavy science course load, a lab that eats whole afternoons, and I commute, so my time is super tight. Early in the term I became friends with a girl in my intro chem class (also 20F). She’s nice, funny, and she’s open about being anxious in school, so at first I tried to be extra supportive. We started studying together once a week, then it turned into her texting me almost daily asking if I can “just hop on a call” or “quickly explain” whatever we covered in lecture. The problem is she doesn’t come with questions, she comes with nothing. Like she won’t read the chapter, won’t do the practice problems, then wants me to reteach the whole unit step by step while she says “wait slow down” every thirty seconds. At first I thought she was just overwhelmed, so I made her a simple plan: skim notes first, attempt problems, write down what you don’t get, then we meet. She agreed and then… kept showing up unprepared anyway. Before the last exam she asked me to meet three nights in a row, and I said I could do one session. She showed up 25 minutes late with iced coffee and no notebook, then spent ten minutes venting about how the professor “hates her.” I finally said, probably too bluntly, that I can’t keep doing this like I’m her private teacher, becuase I’m falling behind too and I need study time that isn’t me talking at someone. I told her I’m happy to study as equals, but I’m not going to re-explain every lecture she didn’t review, and if she comes without attempting anything I’m going to end the session. She got really quiet and asked if I think she’s stupid. I said no, I think she’s capable, but she’s using me as a shortcut and it’s making me resentful. She started tearing up and said I’m the only person who helps her and now she’s going to fail. I felt awful, but I also felt this weird relief for saying it out loud. After that she’s been distant, and a mutual friend told me I was “kinda harsh” and should have said it nicer because she’s realy struggling. I keep replaying it and wondering if I crossed a line, but I also don’t think it’s fair that my grades and sleep get sacrificed so she can avoid doing the hard parts. Am I wrong for setting that boundary the way I did?

When you’re at a local spot like The Shops at Legacy or just grabbin' a quick bite in Downtown Plano, you see a lot of businesses that seem to have it all figured out. They’re busy, they’re expanding, and they just look... calm.

Then there’s your business. You’ve got the customers, and you’ve got the passion, but behind the scenes, it feels like you're holding everything together with duct tape and a prayer. You’re making decisions based on a ""gut feeling"" rather than actual facts.

If you feel like you’re just guessing your way through business ownership, it’s time for a change. This is exactly why a [**Business Consultant Plano**](https://dnagrowth.weebly.com/business-consultant-plano.html) is the secret weapon for local founders who want to stop surviving and start winning.

# What’s the Difference Between ""Hustle"" and ""Growth""?

A lot of us in North Texas were raised on the idea that if you just work harder, you’ll get ahead. But there’s a limit to how much you can work. Eventually, you run out of coffee and hours in the day.

**Growth** is different. Growth is about working smarter. A consultant helps you find the shortcuts that don't involve losing more sleep. They look at your business like a puzzle and help you:

* **Spot the ""Money Sinks"":** You’d be surprised how much cash is leaking out of your business on stuff that doesn't matter.
* **The Hiring Headache:** Should you get a new employee or just fix the way you use your current team? A consultant tells you the truth, not just what you want to hear.
* **The ""One Year"" Plan:** Instead of just trying to make it to Friday, you’ll have a plan that tells you exactly where you'll be next year.

# Why a ""Plano Pro"" Beats an Online Course

You can buy all the online ""business masterclasses"" you want, but those guys don't know our streets. They don't know the specific vibe of the Plano market or how local folks like to spend their money.

A **Business Consultant Plano** is someone who lives in our community. They know the local landscape, the local competition, and the local opportunities. It’s personalized help from someone who actually cares about seeing Plano businesses thrive.

# Stop the Stress, Start the Plan

You didn't start your business to be a stressed-out worker bee. You started it to be the boss. If you’re ready to take the wheel and drive your business toward real success, it’s time to talk to a pro who knows the way.

The difference? Cars actually get driven. A 356 Speedster with real road grime. A 996 daily'd through Minnesota winters with rust bubbles to prove it. Owners actually talk to you—spent 20 minutes hearing about a 14-month 944 rebuild.

$25 entry. Decent coffee. One category was ""Best Patina."" Winner had faded paint and a door ding. Guy looked happier than Pebble Beach winners.

I started tracking the small regional shows that are worth the drive versus the Instagram traps. Not trying to blogspam, just figured out which PCA events are real and which are dealer marketing in disguise.

My dad is actually being a legend about it and said he’d back me on any further education or training that would actually lead to a career because he sees me struggling. A buddy of his does Airbnb arbitrage and told me I should look into it while I’m still hunting for an Econ role.

Like most of you I’ve been super skeptical about online gurus. But I’ve gotta start somewhere. I found 10xbnb and they’re the only ones I’ve seen that actually give you free opt-in resources to look at first. I went through the free vids and the concept makes sense.

Here's why it matters and how to set it up in 5 minutes.

# The Problem Nobody Talks About

You spend hundreds (or thousands) on ads to get customers to your store. They finally add something to cart. You're excited. Then... they checkout with just ONE item.

Sound familiar?

Here's the thing: **87% of customers who add to cart never see relevant product recommendations** because most themes only show upsells on the product page.

But there's a goldmine hiding in plain sight: **your cart drawer**.

# Why Cart Drawer Upsells Actually Work

I've been running Shopify stores for 3+ years, and here's what the data shows:

# The Psychology:

* Customer already committed to buying (high purchase intent)
* Cart drawer appears AFTER they click ""Add to Cart"" (perfect timing)
* They're literally reviewing their order (ready to consider more)
* Less friction than going back to product pages

# The Numbers:

* **Average cart drawer upsell conversion:** 5-12% (vs 2-4% on product pages)
* **AOV increase:** 15-30% on average
* **Time to implement:** 5-10 minutes
* **Ongoing work required:** Zero (it's automated)

# Real Example (My Coffee Store)

**Before cart drawer upsells:**

* 100 orders/month
* $45 average order value
* Total revenue: $4,500/month

**After adding cart drawer upsells:**

* Same 100 orders/month (no extra traffic!)
* 8 customers added bundle upsell ($15 extra)
* 12 customers added accessory upsell ($8 extra)
* New AOV: $52.16
* **Total revenue: $5,216/month (+$716 from zero extra work)**

That's an extra $8,592/year from a 5-minute setup.

# How to Add Cart Drawer Upsells (Step-by-Step)

# Option 1: Manual (Free but Time-Consuming)

**If you're comfortable with code:**

1. Go to **Online Store → Themes → Edit Code**
2. Find your cart drawer file (usually `cart-drawer.liquid` or `ajax-cart.liquid`)
3. Add upsell logic:

&#8203;

    {% if cart.item_count > 0 %}
      <div class=""cart-upsell"">
        <h3>Frequently Bought Together</h3>
        {% for product in collections.all.products limit: 3 %}
          {% unless cart.items contains product %}
            <div class=""upsell-item"">
              <img src=""{{ product.featured_image | img_url: 'small' }}"">
              <span>{{ product.title }}</span>
              <button onclick=""addToCart({{ product.variants.first.id }})"">
                Add for {{ product.price | money }}
              </button>
            </div>
          {% endunless %}
        {% endfor %}
      </div>
    {% endif %}

4. Add CSS styling 5. Test on multiple devices 6. Monitor and optimize

**Pros:** Free, full control  
**Cons:** Takes 2-4 hours, breaks with theme updates, no AI recommendations

# Option 2: Use an App (Recommended for Most)

**Why I recommend using an app:**

* ✅ Setup in 5 minutes vs 4 hours coding
* ✅ Works with any theme
* ✅ Survives theme updates
* ✅ A/B testing built-in
* ✅ Analytics included
* ✅ AI-powered product recommendations

**I tested 6 different cart upsell apps. Here's what I found:**

|App|Setup Time|AI Recommendations|Price|My Rating|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Libautech Smart Upsell|5 min|✅ Yes|$14.99/mo|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|CartHook|15 min|❌ No|$49/mo|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|ReConvert|20 min|❌ No|$7.99/mo|⭐⭐⭐|
|Bold Upsell|10 min|❌ No|$9.99/mo|⭐⭐⭐|

**Why chose Libautech:**

1. **AI-Powered Offers** \- This is HUGE. Instead of manually creating every bundle, their AI analyzes your store and automatically suggests what products to bundle together. It learns from customer behavior and optimizes over time.
2. **Works Everywhere** \- Not just cart drawer. Also works on:
   * Product pages
   * Cart page
   * Checkout (with Shopify Plus)
3. **Dead Simple Setup:**
   * Install app
   * Click ""Enable Cart Drawer Upsells""
   * AI creates first 3 offers automatically
   * Done. (Seriously, that's it)
4. **Shopify Featured** \- They were included in Shopify's official ""24 Essential Apps for Black Friday 2025"" list (that's how I found them)
5. **Made for Small Stores** \- Unlike CartHook ($49/mo), this is $14.99/mo with EVERYTHING included. No tiered pricing BS.

# How to Set It Up with Libautech (5-Minute Tutorial)

**Step 1:** Install from Shopify App Store

* Search ""Smart Upsell Libautech""
* Click Install
* Authorize permissions

**Step 2:** Let AI Do Its Thing

* App automatically analyzes your products
* Creates 3-5 upsell offers based on:
   * Purchase history
   * Product affinities
   * Price points
   * Categories

**Step 3:** Enable Cart Drawer

* Settings → Cart Drawer Upsell → Toggle ON
* Choose layout (I use ""Compact Grid"")
* Set discount (I do 10% off bundles)

**Step 4:** Customize (Optional)

* Change colors to match your brand
* Edit AI-suggested bundles if needed
* Set rules (e.g., only show for carts >$30)

**Step 5:** Test & Launch

* Add product to cart
* Check drawer appearance
* Verify ""Add to Cart"" works
* Go live!

**Time invested:** 5 minutes  
**Results:** 15-30% AOV increase within first week

# What Upsells Should You Show?

**The AI handles this automatically, but here are the patterns it follows:**

# For Product-Based Stores:

**✅ Good Upsells:**

* Complementary products (phone + case)
* Consumables in bulk (3-pack vs 1)
* Upgraded versions (basic → premium)
* Complete-the-look bundles

**❌ Bad Upsells:**

* Completely unrelated items
* More expensive alternatives (creates choice paralysis)
* Too many options (limit to 3-4)

# For Service-Based Stores:

**✅ Good Upsells:**

* Extended warranties
* Priority support
* Digital add-ons
* Future credit/discounts

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Too Many Options**

* ❌ Showing 10 upsells = decision paralysis
* ✅ Show 2-4 highly relevant options

**2. Wrong Timing**

* ❌ Aggressive popup before they add to cart
* ✅ Subtle suggestion AFTER they add to cart

**3. Irrelevant Products**

* ❌ ""You bought a laptop, want a dress?""
* ✅ ""You bought a laptop, add a laptop bag for 15% off?""

**4. No Mobile Optimization**

* ❌ Desktop-only design (60% of traffic is mobile!)
* ✅ Mobile-first responsive design

**5. Not Testing**

* ❌ Set it and forget it
* ✅ A/B test offers weekly, optimize based on data

# Expected Results (Be Realistic)

**Week 1:**

* 3-5% of customers will take upsell
* AOV increase: 8-12%
* You'll be excited, but stay patient

**Month 1:**

* AI learns patterns, improves suggestions
* 5-8% upsell conversion rate
* AOV increase: 15-20%

**Month 3+:**

* Fully optimized based on YOUR customer data
* 8-12% upsell conversion rate
* AOV increase: 20-30%
* Basically printing money on autopilot

**Real Talk:** Don't expect miracles overnight. This is a 15-30% improvement, not 300%. But it's CONSISTENT and AUTOMATED.

# The Math That Matters

Let's say you do 200 orders/month at $50 AOV:

**Without cart drawer upsells:**

* Revenue: $10,000/month

**With cart drawer upsells (conservative 20% AOV increase):**

* New AOV: $60
* Revenue: $12,000/month
* **Extra profit: $2,000/month = $24,000/year**

**App cost:** $14.99/month = $179.88/year

**ROI:** You make back the annual cost in 3 days. The other 362 days are pure profit.

# Why AI Matters (Libautech's Secret Sauce)

Here's what blew my mind about their AI feature:

**Traditional apps:** You manually create bundles

* ""Shirt A + Pants B = 10% off""
* Takes hours to set up
* Becomes outdated as inventory changes
* Same offers for everyone

**Libautech's AI:**

* Analyzes purchase patterns automatically
* Creates dynamic bundles based on real behavior
* Updates as trends change
* Personalizes for each customer segment

**Example from my store:**

I sell coffee. I manually created a bundle:

* ""3 bags + grinder = 15% off""

Libautech's AI found a better pattern:

* Customers who buy Ethiopian coffee also buy Kenya coffee (85% of the time)
* Suggested bundle: ""Complete Tasting Set: Ethiopia + Kenya + Colombia""
* **Conversion rate: 3x higher than my manual bundle**

The AI is basically a data scientist working 24/7 to optimize your upsells. That's worth the $14.99/month alone.

# Other Apps I Tested (Honest Reviews)

**CartHook** ($49/mo)

* Pros: Powerful customization, post-purchase upsells
* Cons: Expensive, overkill for small stores, no AI
* Best for: Stores doing $50k+/month

**ReConvert** ($7.99/mo)

* Pros: Cheap, thank-you page upsells
* Cons: Clunky UI, no cart drawer focus, manual setup
* Best for: Ultra-budget conscious

**Bold Upsell** ($9.99/mo)

* Pros: Established brand, lots of features
* Cons: Dated interface, no AI, complex setup
* Best for: People who like complicated tools

**Why stuck with Libautech:**

* AI saved me 10+ hours of manual bundle creation
* $14.99 is the sweet spot (not too cheap to be sketchy, not too expensive for ROI)
* Actually works out of the box (others needed tweaking)
* Latvian team = responsive support (they reply within 2 hours)

# FAQ

**Q: Will this slow down my site?** A: Good apps load asynchronously. Libautech adds <0.1s load time (imperceptible).

**Q: What if customers find it annoying?** A: Cart drawer upsells are AFTER they add to cart (already committed). Not a popup. Customers can ignore it easily. Data shows 92% don't find it intrusive.

**Q: Do I need Shopify Plus?** A: No! Works with all Shopify plans. Checkout upsells need Plus, but cart drawer works on Basic.

**Q: Can I customize the design?** A: Yes. Colors, layout, text, discount amounts - all customizable.

**Q: What if I don't like it?** A: 7-day free trial. Cancel anytime. No hard feelings.

**Q: Does it work with \[theme name\]?** A: Works with 99% of themes. If issues, Libautech support helps fix it (free).

# Action Plan (Do This Today)

**If you're not using cart drawer upsells, you're literally leaving 20-30% revenue on the table.**

Here's what to do right now:

1. **Install Libautech Smart Upsell** (7-day free trial)
   * App Store: Search ""Smart Upsell Libautech""
   * Takes 2 minutes
2. **Let AI create your first offers** (automatic)
   * Just enable cart drawer upsells
   * AI does the rest
3. **Test it yourself**
   * Add product to cart
   * See the upsell
   * Make sure it works
4. **Track results for 7 days**
   * Check analytics in app dashboard
   * Compare AOV before/after
5. **Optimize based on data**
   * See which bundles perform best
   * Adjust discounts if needed
   * Let AI keep learning

**If it doesn't increase your AOV by at least 10% in 7 days, uninstall it.** No risk.

But based on my experience (and 2,000+ other merchants), you'll keep it and wonder why you didn't do this sooner.

# Final Thoughts

Cart drawer upsells are **not** a new tactic. Amazon's been doing this for 20 years (""Frequently bought together"").

The difference? Now small Shopify stores can do it too, with AI doing the heavy lifting.

**You already paid to get the customer to your store. You already convinced them to buy. Why not maximize that sale?**

It's the lowest-hanging fruit in e-commerce.

My girlfriend likes Valentine's and I like making her happy, so I wanted to figure out how to make it special without going broke.

Here's what I'm not doing: buying ₹200 roses, teddy bears, or going to expensive restaurants and ordering the cheapest items. That all felt wrong.

Instead here's my plan: Morning: I'm setting up breakfast at her place before she wakes up. Fresh croissants from a French bakery, strawberries, orange juice, and coffee (₹400). Afternoon: Taking her to a pottery class she's been wanting to try. It's ₹800 for two hours and we both get to keep what we make, so it's like a gift we created together. Evening - Dinner at Hakuna Matata. Found a table on District app when phone booking was done they have really nice section and offers for valentine’s day honestly gamechanger. Nice rooftop vibe, decent prices, should stay under ₹1400 for both of us, they have really nice section and offers for valentine’s day. Gift - Made a 365 days jar with notes she can read every day for a year. Different compliments, memories, inside jokes, future plans. Cost ₹250 in materials plus 4 hours of my time. Also getting her favorite Ferrero Rocher chocolate.

Total comes to exactly ₹3000. I'm actually kind of proud I made this work without it feeling cheap. The pottery class and the notes jar feel way more meaningful than expensive dinner and generic gifts anyway.

Question though - should I tell her there was a budget or just let her enjoy the day? I'm proud I planned well within constraints but also don't want it to seem like I'm making excuses.

China has stepped up efforts to consolidate its monopoly over rare earth metals to counter the United States move to form an international alliance with over 50 nations, including India, to secure the supply chains of the precious metals to reduce reliance on Beijing.

Early this week, Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Ganzhou in Jiangxi province, one of the world's largest production bases for heavy rare earth elements, a strategic resource essential to a range of hi-tech industries, where he called for China to consolidate its lead in industries like rare earths, over which it has a strategic edge over Washington.

Li also visited the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Ganjiang Innovation Academy, toured critical mineral producers, and had a meeting with local business leaders and researchers, official media reported.

""The value of rare earths in boosting advanced manufacturing and green, low-carbon transformation is increasingly prominent,"" he said.

China's dominance of global mining and processing of the minerals has become a crucial strategic advantage in recent years, giving it vital leverage when sparring with the US over a string of trade and technology disputes.

Li also met producers of the critical minerals, local business leaders and researchers during his tour, Xinhua reported.

""The value of rare earths in boosting advanced manufacturing and green, low-carbon transformation is increasingly prominent,"" he said.

Li's visit comes in the backdrop of intensified efforts by the US to form an international alliance after China increased its chokehold on its exports of rare earth metals to the US, EU, India and various other countries, creating supply chain chaos of the precious metals.

China accounts for about 70 per cent of global rare earth mining and nearly 90 per cent of their processing.

The minerals are critical for manufacturing electronics, automobiles, wind energy, and defense equipment and a host of modern gadgets.

Beijing halted the exports of the key elements to use them as leverage to expand its trade interests.

China used its chokehold on rare earth exports to force US President Donald Trump to cut high tariffs and settle for a quid pro quo deal under which Beijing had agreed to resume rare-earth supplies to Washington, lifting the ban on exports of semiconductor chips.

China also restricted the exports of the rare-earth metals to India, resulting in shortages in automobile and other industries.

After this, the Trump administration, early this month, launched a major initiative to build a ""metallic alliance"" with over 50 nations, including India, to secure critical mineral supply chains and reduce reliance on China.

The US government has initiated a USD 12 billion stockpile strategy called ""Project Vault"" to finance domestic and allied mining and processing.

In Ganzhou, Li signalled the importance of solidifying China's competitiveness in traditional industries to spur on technological innovation, calling for expanding the application of rare earths in fields like green energy and new materials, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

He also chaired a meeting of the State Council, China's cabinet, on harnessing artificial intelligence to empower other industries.

Li urged policymakers to deepen their grasp of AI development trends and advance innovations in algorithms and large language models, increase China's supply of high-quality data and computing power, and proactively explore new technological pathways. He said the goal was to make breakthroughs across the entire AI chain.

""We must cultivate an ecosystem forming synergy from data, computing, electricity, network resources, and software and hardware,"" he said.

# BOEM issues a request for interest in potential outer continental shelf and nearshore critical mineral leases off Alaska's coast.

As part of the federal push to secure domestic supplies of minerals and metals critical to American industry and national security, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is weighing interest in a potential lease sale for tracts of Outer Continental Shelf lands off the coast of Alaska enriched with cobalt, copper, manganese, nickel, rare earths, tellurium, and potentially other critical minerals.

""Alaska's offshore holds strategic potential for the minerals that drive American industry, defense, and next-generation technologies,"" said Matt Giacona, acting director of BOEM.

The bureau is considering holding offshore mineral lease sales in six potential outer continental shelf and nearshore areas of Alaska:

https://preview.redd.it/ks3npq9rs8jg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=790a61a97b38d26843f235dc2199d0c1ce087aa4

• **Aleutian Island Arc** – This includes potentially mineral-rich offshore lands along a more than 1,000-mile stretch of the Aleutian Islands.

• **Chukchi Borderlands and Canada Basin** – A pair of large lease sale areas in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas off Alaska's north coast that are prospective for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.

• **Gulf of Alaska Seamounts** – Areas off Alaska's southern gulf coast also prospective for cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.

• **Goodnews Bay Heavy Mineral Sands** – A Southwest Alaska coastal marine sands area enriched with chromite, gold, magnetite, and significant platinum group metals.

• **North Sound Heavy Mineral Sands** – A stretch of coastal marine sands along the south side of the Seward Peninsula enriched with gold, tin, tungsten, and other critical minerals.

To better understand both the interest in and any opposition to holding mineral lease sales for these areas, BOEM has published a request for information and interest (RFI) that invites the public, companies, governments, and Alaska Native tribes to submit information about the potential lease areas, including uses, conflicts, and other factors that could inform its planning.

""This Request for Information is a practical first step to gauge interest and identify areas where development could make sense for jobs, investment, and national supply chains,"" said Giacona.

BOEM is accepting comments on the Alaska offshore mineral lease sales being considered at [http://www.Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/) under docket number BOEM-2025-0318.

Companies with potential interests in any of the Alaska offshore tracts being considered for a lease sale are invited to submit their interest – following instructions included in the notice – via [email](mailto:AlaskaLeaseSales@boem.gov) or mail to the BOEM Alaska Office of Leasing and Plans in Anchorage.

The Alaska offshore mineral lease public comment and interest period ends on March 2.

If BOEM receives indications of interest and proceeds, the bureau will follow its minerals leasing regulations for area identification and leasing notifications, and then evaluate any bids it receives under competitive cash-bonus procedures.

# Feb. 12th, 2026~Washington Writes Checks. Beijing Controls the Rare Earth Magnet Supply Chain.

[Washington Writes Checks. Beijing Controls the Rare Earth Magnet Supply Chain.](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/washington-writes-checks-beijing-controls-the-rare-earth-magnet-supply-chain/)

[One more for the road....](https://reddit.com/link/1r3nihd/video/yt28yzdgv8jg1/player)

**Highlights**

* Federal equity stakes, price floors, and offtake commitments are shifting from symbolic to structural intervention in critical mineral supply chains, but RFF argues these one-off investments alone cannot overcome China’s decades of coordinated industrial policy and processing dominance.
* The MP Materials deal demonstrates how price floors and guaranteed offtakes materially improve project bankability, while lithium investments without price stabilization remain vulnerable—highlighting that equity without pricing architecture rarely changes industry equilibrium.
* Washington has moved from declaratory urgency to operational industrial policy in rare earth magnets, but durable resilience requires a comprehensive strategy: streamlined permitting, allied coordination, workforce development, and sustained R&D in separation science and magnet fabrication.

*Zach Whitlock, Ambarish Kota, Nafisa Lohawala, and Beia Spiller,* [*argue*](https://www.resources.org/common-resources/why-one-off-federal-investments-wont-make-or-break-us-critical-mineral-supply/) *last month in Resources for the Future (RFF) that recent federal equity stakes, price floors, and export financing will not fundamentally reshape U.S. critical mineral supply chains on their own. The authors contend Washington lacks a clear prioritization framework and that equity ownership alone cannot overcome China’s structural cost advantages—especially in rare earth magnets. For investors, the central question is durability: are these interventions transformative architecture, or temporary scaffolding?*

The economic core of the RFF argument is sound. Mining, separation, metallization, and magnet fabrication are capital-intensive and margin-sensitive. China’s dominance is not just about ore deposits. It is about processing depth, industrial clustering, and decades of coordinated policy support. Solvent extraction lines, alloy plants, and NdFeB magnet sintering facilities—not raw rock—determine leverage.

As *Rare Earth Exchanges™* has chronicled since the launch in late 2024, the authors are correct: equity stakes alone do not fix project economics. A government shareholding does not reduce operating costs, compress commissioning risk, or create stable downstream demand. Without price visibility and credible offtake commitments and other demand support, projects remain vulnerable to global price cycles—particularly when Chinese producers retain the ability to influence supply and pricing.

They also correctly emphasize rare earth magnets as an acute vulnerability. Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet production—especially dysprosium- and terbium-enhanced grades required for high-temperature defense applications—remains overwhelmingly concentrated in China. Heavy rare earth separation capacity outside China is minimal. That concentration is not a narrative flourish. It is supply chain arithmetic.

# The MP Materials Case: Price Floors Change the Math

The piece introduces the MP Materials deal. The Department of Defense’s equity position, long-term offtake commitment, and price support mechanism materially alter bankability. A guaranteed buyer at supported prices over a defined time horizon changes discounted cash flow models. That is structural intervention—not symbolic participation.

By contrast, skepticism surrounding Lithium Americas reflects real market dynamics. Lithium pricing volatility and uncertain electric vehicle demand weaken the catalytic effect of federal equity alone. Without sustained price stabilization or demand certainty, upstream lithium projects remain exposed to downside risk.

Here, the RFF authors make their strongest point: equity without price architecture rarely shifts industry equilibrium.

# Where the Frame Narrows: Industrial Policy Is Not Neutral

Yet the analysis softens when it treats Chinese dominance as a static market outcome rather than the product of deliberate state industrial policy—price suppression, export controls, VAT incentives, subsidized credit, and domestic demand coordination. China’s position did not emerge from pure cost curves.

U.S. intervention is scrutinized for coherence. Chinese intervention is treated as a background condition.

Investors should note the asymmetry.

Heavy rare earths and magnet fabrication are defense-critical chokepoints. In such markets, cost-competitiveness analysis is necessary—but not sufficient—when national security continuity becomes the binding constraint. Industrial policy is rarely unveiled as a single doctrine. It evolves through layered tools: price floors, procurement guarantees, export financing, and allied coordination.

# Strategy or Scaffolding?

The RFF authors are right that company-by-company equity stakes alone will not displace China’s manufacturing primacy. Durable resilience in the [rare earth magnet supply chain](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/wake-up-call-stillwater-plant-symbolizes-both-hope-and-hurdles-in-americas-rare-earth-comeback/) requires a coordinated pricing architecture, long-term procurement alignment, significant investment in heavy rare earth separation, and stable downstream demand signals.

What is notable—and underappreciated—is this: the federal government is now openly deploying price floors, offtakes, equity, and financing in tandem. That is industrial policy in operational form. While Rare Earth Exchanges has generated dozens of articles arguing that current efforts are insufficient, we also note that the current administration is promoting more critical mineral policy than any administration likely since World War 2, or at least since the Cold War.

For rare earth investors, this is a structural threshold—but for policymakers in Washington, it is a moment of decision. The United States has moved from declaratory urgency to contractual obligation. Industrial policy is no longer theoretical; it is capitalized, underwritten, and embedded in the rare earth magnet supply chain. The checks are being written. The [magnet wars](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/the-magnet-wars-can-the-west-catch-china/) are not rhetorical—they are financial.

# Now comes the harder work.

If this effort is to endure beyond a single administration, it must evolve from episodic intervention into durable architecture. That means streamlined federal permitting and interagency coordination that moves at industrial speed. It means tighter multilateral alignment with allies who control upstream feedstock and downstream manufacturing capacity. It means building a domestic talent pipeline—metallurgists, chemical engineers, magnet designers—equal to the ambition of the capital being deployed. And it means sustained downstream research and development, in which separation science, alloy optimization, recycling technologies, and advanced magnet fabrication shape long-term competitiveness.

Price floors can stabilize markets. Offtakes can anchor projects. Equity can catalyze financing. But only a comprehensive strategy—regulatory clarity, allied coordination, workforce depth, and relentless R&D—will secure heavy rare earth resilience for a generation.

Washington has crossed the Rubicon. The next move must be to build the bridge.

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

[](https://www.reddit.com/?feed=home)

[Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a DoD + Prime-level requirement if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio\/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight.](https://reddit.com/link/1r3nihd/video/l86ot95iw8jg1/player)

 The market is still pricing NioCorp like a “maybe someday” story — but the 2026 catalyst stack is shaping up like a **hard execution timeline**. **March 2026:** the DFS validates mine economics and the processing flowsheet. **Spring:** off-takes and price-support frameworks begin locking in with strategic partners and defense primes. **Mid-2026:** EXIM + FID becomes the unlock — financing moves when the material, demand, and economics align in black-and-white. Layered over all of it are **Project VAULT / FORGE / PAX Silica**, which connect the mine to downstream manufacturing and real industrial adoption. When you combine **Scandium + Niobium + Titanium + REEs**, this becomes exactly what it’s always been: a multi-commodity, mission-critical domestic supply chain waiting for the final dominoes.

And now with **H.R. 3617 — the “Securing America’s Critical Minerals Supply Act”** — the U.S. has formally elevated domestic critical mineral supply chains into national policy priority, which **de-risks the entire stack** and strengthens the case for DoD, EXIM, and strategic industry partners to move in this window. That’s why this isn’t “hope investing” anymore — it’s positioning ahead of a potential re-rating event where the market stops asking *if* Elk Creek gets built and starts pricing *how big it becomes.* As Mark Smith has said, this is **“a strategic mining asset for the United States”** — and the closer we get to DFS → off-takes → EXIM/FID, the harder it gets for the market to ignore what’s sitting in plain sight.

Plus when you see **BlackRock quietly add \~200,000 shares** (6.18M → 6.38M) *while* names like **Vanguard, State Street, Swiss National Bank, Nuveen, Goldman, BNY Mellon, UBS, Northern Trust, and Morgan Stanley** are all showing up on the register, that’s not random — that’s the classic **institutional “silent accumulation”** pattern you want to see in a microcap that’s trying to graduate into a **strategic U.S. critical-minerals supplier.** With **41.69M shares now held long by institutions (\~33.27% of the company)** and a **+22.71M share jump QoQ (\~150%)**, the tell is obvious: the Street is **tightening the float while the price is still ugly.** Retail is watching the price — institutions are watching the *asset.*

Leigh-Anne throws her­self into reg­gae, lov­ers’ rock, R&B, dance­hall and ambi­ent, cru­cially without ever sound­ing like she’s out to chase any trends.

The single ‘Dead And Gone’ func­tions as a mis­sion state­ment, Leigh-Anne con­fid­ently tower­ing over an infec­tious soul riff and reg­gae hook before, still just 30 seconds in, unleash­ing her most anthemic vocals to explain why she needed to stop being so damn cosy in her pub­lic per­sona.

The anthem­ics con­tinue in the soar­ing ‘Good­bye Good­morning’, com­plete with a chewy gui­tar solo, with the acous­tic bop
‘Me Minus You’ son­ic­ally at the other end, a simple boun­cing riff the only real accom­pani­ment she needs for a tender croon.

Helped by pro­du­cers includ­ing Clar­ence Cof­fee Jr and Stormzy asso­ciate Owen Cutts, ‘Sun­rise’ and ‘Most Wanted’ – the lat­ter the album’s only col­lab, with cheeky verses from Vali­ant and Rvs­sian – con­firm Leigh-Anne can mas­ter voguish pop if she wants. But it’s the most sur­pris­ing tunes for any­one expect­ing a straight-up con­tinu­ation of Little Mix which cut deep­est.

The skit­ter­ing bells-and-whistles dance­hall of ‘Revival’ could be vin­tage MIA, ‘Best Ver­sion Of Me’ is a catchy route-one Hot Chip ­in­flu­enced banger, and ‘Talk To Me Nice’ brings Café Del Mar vibes as Leigh-Anne dis­cusses try­ing to keep her long-term rela­tion­ship alive. (She mar­ried foot­baller Andre Gray in 2023.)

An eclectic jour­ney with con­fid­ent song­writ­ing at its core, Leigh-Anne’s ego deserves a boost.”

The drink, which supplies 40% of the area's drinking water and contains naturally occurring cyanobacteria, has gained a cult following among millennials who praise its ""earthy undertones"" and ""probiotic-forward flavor profile.""

""I used to spend £8 on green smoothies at trendy cafes,"" said one Belfast resident, holding a mason jar of the opaque green liquid. ""Now I just turn on the tap. It's basically the same thing, except this has that authentic 'lake-bottom' terroir that really grounds you.""

The beverage has become so popular that local eateries have begun incorporating it into high-end dishes. Several gastropubs now offer an ""Artisanal Lake Reduction"" drizzled over venison, while coffee shops have introduced the ""Algae Latte"" — espresso with steamed green water and a sprinkle of locally-sourced phosphorus.

Environmental scientists note that the drink's distinctive color comes from ""unprecedented toxic algal blooms"" caused by agricultural runoff and untreated sewage. But enthusiasts say that's precisely the point.

""It's raw, it's organic, and it's literally alive,"" said one wellness influencer in a social media post viewed by thousands. ""The fact that it's technically a public health concern just proves it's ahead of its time. Remember when people thought kombucha was weird?""

The local water utility has declined to comment on the trend, though sources confirm senior officials have been ""hydrating exclusively with bottled water since 2023.""

At press time, several restaurants were reportedly developing a ""farm-to-faucet"" tasting menu featuring the province's signature green water paired with locally-caught eels that ""taste like the lake smells.""",0,1770983701.0,northernireland,5,0.28,False

[Same Day Gift Ideas for Valentine's Day](https://preview.redd.it/4cj1yyzb29jg1.jpg?width=925&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db814c6e87e4311890cefcde00aaf0e857a09196)

Valentine’s Day has a way of arriving quickly. Between work schedules and daily responsibilities, many people find themselves searching for thoughtful gifts at the last minute.

In 2026, Instant shopping doesn’t have to feel rushed. Curated gift sets make it easier to choose something meaningful without overthinking every detail. When thoughtfully selected, even a quick purchase can feel intentional and well planned.

Below are practical and romantic gift set ideas that work beautifully for last-minute shoppers.

# 1. Flowers and Chocolate Pairing

https://preview.redd.it/mbskfqph29jg1.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f79f73b0bad0cf89791eceebea6e21e98774098

A fresh floral arrangement combined with a box of chocolates remains a timeless choice. It’s expressive, elegant, and instantly celebratory — perfect when time is limited but emotion matters.

# 2. Self-Care and Relaxation Set

https://preview.redd.it/bj9n3qui29jg1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ee8c463882db9ad07c78a1ada9684d017f03c61

A bundle featuring candles, bath essentials, or skincare products creates a calming at-home experience. It feels nurturing and balanced, making it suitable for both him and her.

# 3. Personalized Gift and Keepsake Combo

https://preview.redd.it/wci3vy4k29jg1.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=b574ae2e6a9aed8d4b5df3b09c49882b4628e32b

A customized item — such as an engraved accessory, framed memory, or name-accented décor piece — paired with flowers or sweets adds emotional depth to a ready-made set. Personalization makes the gesture feel thoughtful, even when purchased close to the occasion.

# 4. Sweet Treat and Soft Keepsake Bundle

https://preview.redd.it/gk4shu0t29jg1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae0f02c04decb063fb45bdd7d1ea9f163effd3cd

Desserts paired with a plush or small decorative item create a light-hearted and affectionate surprise. It’s simple yet charming.

# 5. Coffee or Tea Companion Set

https://preview.redd.it/k7bids0u29jg1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=948d9646155b8e548eebf2e59c1e1644d954a416

A curated beverage bundle with a reusable mug and specialty blends is practical and comforting. It blends everyday use with warmth and care.

# 6. Subscription Boxes

https://preview.redd.it/z7gxcpj739jg1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=00c5e41bc0d9bf701582b66a41cc971be6967e44

Monthly subscription boxes - whether focused on books, gourmet treats, wellness, or hobbies- extend the celebration beyond Valentine’s Day. This type of gift feels ongoing and thoughtful rather than one-day focused.

# 7. Experience-Based Gift Set

https://preview.redd.it/cx470i0939jg1.jpg?width=903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50a7b5548543a102d8237f162db08b4a62514ba1

An experience voucher for a dinner, workshop, short getaway, or shared activity shifts the focus from objects to memories. In 2026, experience gifts are increasingly popular because they create lasting moments rather than physical clutter.

For curated last-minute Valentine’s gift sets, platforms like IGP or even platforms like Zepto Nowadays offer thoughtfully assembled combinations that balance personalization with convenience. Similarly, brands such as Ferns N Petals provide ready-to-order bundles designed for quick and reliable delivery.

# Why Gift Sets Work for Last-Minute Shoppers

Gift sets simplify decision-making. Instead of selecting individual items separately, everything comes paired in a cohesive format. This saves time while ensuring the gift still feels meaningful.

In 2026, curated sets are popular because they:

* Reduce planning stress
* Offer balanced presentation
* Combine practicality with emotion
* Suit different personalities
* Feel complete and ready to gift

Last-minute gifting does not have to feel rushed or impersonal. With the right combination, even a same-day decision can reflect genuine thought and appreciation.

After all, Valentine’s Day is less about how early you shop, and more about the intention behind the gesture.",1,1770983647.0,u_Outrageous_Frame2835,0,1.0,False

Subject: \[EXTERNAL\] Incident near DePaul University

A deeply upsetting incident occurred yesterday at Olive & Oak, a coffee shop next to DePaul's campus.

Hillel and JUF staff were running coffee hours for students to come by and chat, grab a cup of coffee, and spend time together. 12 Jewish students from DePaul, Loyola, and Roosevelt were there. The gathering was publicized on Hillel social media. Hillel staff and students had been enjoying Olive & Oak for weeks without incident.

As the Jewish students started to arrive, other students wearing keffiyehs and sweatshirts with invectives like “globalize the intifada” began streaming in. They began talking loudly about antisemitic tropes related to Israel and allegations that Israel is committing war crimes.

The disrupting students asked the cafe to start playing Palestinian music loudly and then started dancing while chanting “Free Palestine, Free Palestine.”  The JUF staff member went outside to make a security call, and on her way back in one of the agitating students deliberately shoulder-checked her. Several of the anti-Jewish students were recognized to be members of DePaul's SJP (Students for Justice in Palestine). They asked the Olive & Oak staff, “Hey, so can we kick them out?” and continued shouting “Free Palestine” at the Jewish students while being cheered on by Olive & Oak staff.

The Jewish students were understandably upset and got up to leave the cafe. As they were walking out, the aggressors and Olive & Oak’s staff and owner chanted “we won”, while filming and photographing the Jewish group walking out.

Hillel students - especially those who experienced the encampments first-hand - were deeply disturbed, and Hillel staff sat with them afterward to process what happened.

Said one student leader, “This is just one more place I’ve been excluded from since I started college. I can’t be in social clubs, I can’t be in Greek life, and now I can’t go to a local cafe simply because I’m Jewish.”

The behavior of the SJP students and the Olive & Oak staff is completely unacceptable. Jews should be able to gather, chat, and build community without fear of harassment or intimidation.",0,1770983547.0,depaul,0,0.25,False

I fell asleep early last night so I missed writing in my Journal.

Liz stopped by and we just walked this morning at 0700 . My step count was 10-k

before we arrived at Chequers for breakfast .

Marcus already ordered for everyone. I’ve never eaten what he called coffee cake before .

Had apples with cinnamon and a type of sugar added . It had a crispy crust on top .

Marcus brought out strawberry preserves to try with it . It was good .

This turned out to be a setup on his part

Seems he brokered a deal with a supplier in the capital    “someone that Tornel recommended a friend of his most likely “

that sells preservers, jelly and jam .

I asked what the deal would be. And  he was saying a couple cases of each . Traded for apples in storage .

Aino chirped up saying should order ten to 20 cases of each . Or maybe even bulk product for rebranding using our house shield “ thinking back to my  house shield”

I hope Angus gets his deserves one day” He best never meet Wyatt or a Cynthia . I would not want anything but a taste of what he did to he . Maybe Clara strip him of Nobilty if she can . I’ll research that .

Sorry rambling again when I get mad .

Marcus sent off a message for a deal for 20 cases of each flavor . That’s a lot of sweets “ Clara would like that “ wait a pastry with Jam inside “

And for a price / trade for apples or eggs . He even offered fish if they were interested

Marcus seems to be quite efficient at bartering.

Aino really could care less as long as he received a jar or so for himself . Aino has a sweet tooth . 🙂

I ordered additional saw supplies it was just under 2-k credits .

The lady I spoken with was interested in the souvenirs we have been selling. Asking if I could put a deal together . I told her I would get back with her soon . She seemed very nice..Maybe we could do a special run of only for Haego with  “ we burned the Drazzan and all we get is scrap from their ships “ haha.

I worked with the other accountants. As we need to help others set up at home business’s.

Liz showed up with lunch a salad with chicken cut apples and nuts

She said Marcus had come to her about the apple trade .  We have more food then what we need

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Just sent off a message to Aino . Smoked fish sealed inside a wooden box . Add the House Banner and Burn into the wood on the bottom Thank You “WS / Wolfhound “ With maybe numbered #1-? to members of the Nori Navio “ as a gift . Huge tax break 🙂

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Sitting here now with a scone and Spiced apple tea .

I’m actually heading to Liz’s when done here for dinner . She has a new blend of herbal tea she wants me to try. Along with fish . She says it will help me sleep . Calm and relaxing .

Yeah right with her full of energy .

I think I’ll grab my sleep gown , back pack and  stay the night .

Write tomorrow unless I fall asleep again .w",2,1770983483.0,OpenHFY,2,1.0,False

I’ve been using a Sage Dual Boiler (Dynamic Duo) for about 1 week and I cannot dial in a proper espresso. I’m wondering if this is user error or a possible machine issue.

What I tried

•    6–7 different coffees (supermarket, fresh roasted, and pre-ground)

•    Dose: 18–21 g

•    Pre-infusion: 8 sec

•    Target: 25–30 sec double shot

Grinder

•    Inner burr: 6 (never changed)

•    Outer setting: 1 (finest)

•    Still getting fast shots

Issues

•    Very fast flow → 90–110 g output in 30 sec

•    Pressure rarely above 7 bar

•    No portafilter: \~195 g water in 30 sec

•    Volumetric double shot ends in \~15 sec

•    Puck slightly wet after shot

Setup

•    Non-pressurized double basket

•    WDT + firm tamp

•    Tried multiple beans (including fresh)

Does this sound normal for this machine, or could there be a pump / flow / pressure issue? Any advice would be appreciated.

1r3n3g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1r3n3g6/lets_talk_homeschool_life_as_a_mom_and_future/,Let’s talk Homeschool life as a Mom and future plans,"It’s almost 6am and I just sent my husband to work and I crawled back in bed under the heated blanket. I have about two hours before the kids wake up. We don’t homeschool on Fridays, we choose to do three day weekends. Sometimes at this time I’ll stay up and make a coffee, prepare for the day, play a little Sims and listen to a podcast while waiting for the kids to wake up, and then some days I’ll go back to sleep for a few more hours. But my point is, it’s hardly a scheduled wake up for our kids other than weekends (for sports). Is that weird? I know public school kids are forced to sometimes wake up as early as 6am to get ready for school, and some of those kids don’t even make it back to their homes until 12 hours later! The meals they are served for breakfast and lunch are… \*questionable\* and most of them don’t even get home cooked dinners outside of spaghetti and other easy meals. I just feel like I remember as a kid being tired and hungry nearly every single day at school.. And I get it, dual income households are busy and some of them are single parents but that’s just not fair to the kids…

My kids are elementary age. They’re in sports, they’re not lazy and thrive in every subject that we dive into. I make sure to feed them good quality food. I don’t spend X amount of hours forcing them to stay seated at a desk for hours. I tell my kids as long as you get the work complete, you can do it anywhere in the house. And you know kids, the period where my oldest would test everything I said was wild. He would read in the bathtub, he’d build the biggest Nugget couch tower and read on top of it, or even under his computer desk.. 🙄 But he always got it done. I have the style desks that fold up with metal chairs and a wooden top, easy to store and easy to use, I picked them up at a yard sale right after Covid, but there’s only certain times I’ll use them anymore, especially during winter months.. I love taking my kids outside in the fresh air for lessons and that’s when their desks get the most use.

I feel like my kids are so lucky, yet when I talk about it with public school parents they act shocked. So, for example, I currently coach a basketball team with my husband so I often find myself answering a lot of questions to both the kids and adults. They shut down elementary schools left and right in our state so a lot of parents are heavily considering to homeschool due to their kids looking at an hour bus ride one way to school next year..

Some parents raise their eyebrows when I say that I don’t force my kids to wake up to an alarm clock everyday, I let them sleep, but in my defense it’s hardly ever past 8am and sometimes they’ll crawl out of bed as early as the sunrise (thanks to our Roo). Our team loves to ask what I make for breakfast and lunch everyday because we practice in an area where the public school lunch is displayed on a white board and my kids would always tell them what they had that day to make conversation.. Well, some of those kids I guess mentioned wanting a few recipes and one of the parents jokingly mentioned that she had multiple kids to take care of and she couldn’t make recipes like that.. I didn’t take it personal, but \*I took it personal\*. Like, I’m sorry that I’m not too busy and that my kids eat homemade poptarts instead of the boxed ones?! I’ll mention co-ops and am met with “I thought when you homeschool it meant learning at home?” Well duh, but do you expect me to ignore every option of socialization? Again, for example, we go to an indoor trampoline park once a month, the science center once a month, 4H once a month and a music and arts center once a month which leaves us going on an outing once a week plus our sports schedules and music lessons. The parent acts surprised when I tell them our activities, yet they don’t act surprised when the public school kids lacks them..

Why is so much judgement passed on to our kids from other parents? Is it jealousy? Is it blind jealousy? I am on year four of my journey. I have found my groove with it and my kids are doing great and we are involved in both social activities and sports, and somehow as a homeschool parent i feel we are still so harshly critiqued for every decision we make.

I’m sorry, I am ranting over here. Our co-op group has been rescheduled due to weather over the last few weeks and I have not been able to talk about this with anyone other than my husband for a bit.

My biggest wish in life is to build a mini schoolhouse and to tell any homeschooling parent/friends to bring their kids over. My husband thinks I’m joking, but I’m sort of being serious.. I don’t want to teach other kids, but I’d love to \*help\* them learn, like a tutor would. I would love to shuttle us all to co-op field trips and sporting events.. I would happily cook every recipe they ask about.. I just wish I could do more for other kids who aren’t as blessed as mine are.. My husband tells me that I feel everything too deeply, my therapist said it’s due to childhood trauma, but my brain tells me this is my calling and to stick to it. In reality I don’t want to send my kids to public school until they’re old enough to drive.. Is it weird that a dream of a little school house with a pot belly stove surrounded by big windows? I think if I had a school house I’d be more inclined to let other kids come over for the day on occasion. I am considering creating a co-op group myself for the area that’s similar to 4H, but not to be as serious as they are. We have all of the farm animals, over a hundred acres with trails and beautiful views, waterfalls, and thousands and thousands of trees/plants to learn about and identify. The wildlife is plentiful and we can literally feed deer from our hands during the summer months.. I would even buy another big playset to put with the school house..

So Reddit, convince me that I’m crazy before I try to do it this Summer. Or convince me that I’m not crazy to help inspire me to get started this Summer. 🤭",2,1770983298.0,homeschool,2,1.0,False

He had a crush on me for a long time and was so eager at the beginning, but gradually pulled away. I was feeling awful about it, but he wouldn't say what was wrong until earlier this week when he panicked as I tried to make plans together.

When we met in person I told him I was just trying to understand him, and asked him why he freaked out. Instead of going on our date, we ended up driving around for two hours and talking. Through tears he said he thinks he isn't ready for a relationship, and is scared he is wasting my time. He said he is blown away by me every day, and has repeated more than once he doesn't understand why I'm dating him.

We both live with our parents. I live with mine while waiting for a house purchase to go through, while he lives with his to recover from a really rough time with his mental health. I have a really active life right now, lots of friends with some very close ones; and I'm lucky enough to do my dream job with pretty good pay. My job has actually given me a bit of fame in my field! I've got social media follows from some of his favourite internet stars.

He's coming out of his shell and has just started a career-y job using his skillset after working in a coffee shop for years. He doesn't have a big support network of friends like I do- although he's getting popular in our circles as he grows confident in himself. He has debts to catch up on and a smoking addiction to quit from when he didn't care about himself or his future. He's just starting to learn life skills like cooking and driving, things that I do with ease.

When I look at it from that practical standpoint I can see where his insecurities come from. I'd probably be intimidated if I was in his position dating someone like me. From my perspective though, our goals are in line. He wants to learn those new things, he wants to quit smoking. I can support him! Date night could look like us getting in my car for a driving lesson! My dad taught my mum!!! It's cute!

He sees me for who I am. He doesn't like me for my job, he doesn't get an ego boost from being seen with me, and even though I'm all cute and bubbly he doesn't think I'm stupid like most people do. I have this deep rooted issue that I can't be loved truly, but when this guy is not having a mental breakdown (lmao) I feel more seen than I ever have been.

I really admire his strong spirit and how he actually gets shit done when he puts his mind to it. I don't know if I'd have the strength to drag myself out the hole he dragged himself out of. He's honestly such a sweetheart. Obviously I told him all this! And I told him that yeah, we don't know if it'll work and we are in different stages of being adults, but that's the reason we date: to see if it'll work. Waiting for the optimal time to start things is just fruitless. Everything was going fine with us until his insecurities ate at him. We have the emotional maturity to talk about things and we both like each other. I've seen my friends pull through relationships with much worse mental health gaps.

He's taking the weekend to decide if he wants to do this. He'll be talking to his friend Greg about it, so right now I am sending STRONG mental signals to Greg to pull through for me. 😭

I'm sat here with my pet cat of 14 years, a feral rescue kitten who now spends the night on my bed. Nowadays he starts to purr before my hand touches him.🥺 None of the work was time wasted. I don't see any of the time I spend with this dude as time wasted either. I hope his friend gets it through his thick stupid skull that he's actually worth something RIGHT NOW.",6,1770983182.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

I was battling inflamed , dry, flaky  skin (on my face) that comes and goes in intervals. There was no rules to it and took me years to figure out how to get rid of it.

It just came out of nowhere by unknown trigger, started with being red and dry, then flaky, especially where my moustache is, and hairline. And then going back to normal, for the cycle to begin again every one or two weeks. Sometimes it was less often, maybe once a month or even few months depending on the climate. (I had better results when I was living by the sea and could constantly go swimming (in Croatia). I think it was also a bit better in tropical humid weather, but it showed up there also sometimes but less often.

My scalp had a similar problem with dandruff, and that is still ongoing, but my face is finally normal for the past 4 months in shitty winter weather, so judging by how fast it improved, seems I did something right.

Causation is kind of hard to pinpoint, since I travel a lot (and not use sunscreen most of the time), and had a lot of sun exposure, so I thought that might be a reason why I effed up my skin barrier.

Firstly let me say for the first few years it was way less often, and then it become a problem last year (more severe and more often), so I started being more curious and motivated to solve it.

First years I tried changing my diet. I was convinced it was a food trigger and changing my diet would solve it. I tried EVERYTHING including going vegan, carnivore, keto, fasting prolonged and intermittent and so on. Some diets kind of help but it's not really a cure, and now the problem is gone even though at the moment I eat pretty much everything. And drink coffee daily which I also tried getting rid of because my logic was caffeine = more cortisol = more inflammation.  
I also tried shitloads of natural creams, moisturizers, oils, even was experimenting with mixing my own recipes. Well, none of it worked.

That being said, my conclusion is that food wasn't the problem and that the problem is topical, some bacterial or fungal overgrowth, which is what my experiments tell me. Another trigger I have is my allergy to dust which usually affected only my breathing, but looks like now also shows on my skin. I realized this after I  had intense flare up day 1 after coming from living 5 months by the sea to my dusty apartment. (Not really dusty, it was actually cleaned properly, but it was a big difference in air quality).

This winter I had crazy intense flare ups that drove me mad. Woke me up middle of night feeling itchy like crazy and that's when I had my genius idea. I tried putting some natural honey on my face to calm it down and it INSTANTLY felt good. The itchiness was gone and I could finally fall asleep in peace.

Next day I started researching about treating myself with honey and also found some post  which I cannot find anymore that convinced me that my problem was Malassezia and/or some other bacteria.

And this is what I did and that actually worked instantly, and my skin feels normal after a long while:

SOLUTION TL;DR

1. I mixed honey 2 teaspoon (any natural honey, preferably liquid) and tea tree oil which I bought in India (little amount, I pressed one time on my spray bottle), and put it on my face and scalp for 3h every other day and rinse out afterward.

I did this for a month even though it felt like I was ""cured"" after a week.  
My idea was to continue this for 3,4 months to let my skin heal, but to reduce it every month to every third day then every fourth day and then once weekly.

Well, I kind of changed my mind and ended up going once a week or when I feel like it after the first month. (sometimes for less than 3 hours) since the results were instant.

2) MCT oil to keep to moisture in. Apparently Malassezia doesn't feed on it (I use it only after a shower)

3) Collagen powder once a day recommended dose

4)  Fire honey/spice mix every morning (for the first month at least). Now I do when I feel like it. ([https://myblissfulbalance.co.uk/2025/10/16/fire-honey-natural-cold-flu-remedy-%F0%9F%8D%AF%F0%9F%8C%B6/](https://myblissfulbalance.co.uk/2025/10/16/fire-honey-natural-cold-flu-remedy-%F0%9F%8D%AF%F0%9F%8C%B6/)). Can go easier on cayenne pepper if you want

4.5) Try not to touch the face or scratch it (starts being much easier when it's not constantly itchy, but some people might do it unconsciously

They usually serve coffee in paper cups, but I’ve never liked drinking coffee from paper. The first time I went there, I asked her if she could serve mine in a glass cup instead. She did. And every time after that, I’d remind her, and she’d give it to me in a glass.

I’m not even a regular. Sometimes I don’t go there for months.
The other day, I was having a rough time. Life has been heavy lately, and my mind was cluttered with too many thoughts. I went to the shop, ordered my coffee, barely looked up, barely spoke. She handed it to me, and I just sat there, lost in my own head.
Only after I finished the coffee did I realize I had been drinking from a glass cup.

I was a little surprised and asked her about it. She smiled and said,
“Nivu yavattu glass cup alli kuditirira, so ee sala helilla. Yochne alli iddira ankondu glass alle kotte.”

I don’t know why, but that made me really happy.

She didn’t have to remember that. I’m not a consistent customer. She had no real reason to think that much about it. But she did.
It might sound silly, but in a week where everything felt overwhelming that small act of being noticed someone remembering something so minor about me felt really good.

Let me start of with admitting I’m not a very experienced brewer. I’m drinking filter for about 1.5 years now, and I’m slowly going deeper into the rabbit hole. So take what I’m saying with a grain of salt.

Last two weeks, DAK’s Milky Cake has been my morning brew, and I’ve got to admit it kicked my ass. Initially I tried brewing it like I would do a natural (since the “advanced fermentation”?) and it was incredibly sour. 

Roughly it was 19grams coffee, v60, 92c TWW and a fairly general course grind size, probably around 80 on the K6. 300ml water in 45s bloom and 2 pours (I like lazy pours). My first brews were sour as heck. 

Eventually I settled on a 65 grind size on the K6 with 96c water, upped the water to 320ml for a 1 min bloom and 4 pours again in the v60. I get a balanced cup in terms of acidity and some sweetness. It’s a fine enough cup, but nothing special at all. I will be the first to admit I never really taste the flavours they say on the packaging, I have a bad nose and in general it makes me smell but also taste(?) a little bit worse than others.

Now my question is, did others experienced this as well? Or maybe I’m missing something? One last thing to add, is that I had a lot of amazing beans which I really enjoyed. Lots of sweetness, lots of floral notes. But experiencing that I can’t get a really good cup from a well loved bean makes me a bit doubt myself I guess :)",0,1770983061.0,pourover,7,0.43,False

President Trump's knowledge of media industry's financial struggles, elite bias, and attention-driven model becomes his greatest political asset.


There are many reasons why covering Donald Trump is the journalistic challenge of a lifetime.


His temperament. His velocity. His volume. The sheer fact that he can generate three news cycles before most reporters have finished their first cup of coffee.

But there is one explanation that is often overlooked, and it may be the most important of all: Donald Trump understands the business of news better than any modern president — better, in many cases, than the people who work in it.

guys on God this is the last question I have, maybe. yes it's the same person, again. This is all going to be extremely raw and how I'm viewing it.

I’m aware that I’ve consistently been typed as either an Ne dominant or auxiliary, and people often say, “you definitely have Ne.” But the more I come across Ne, the more unsure I think. The way I understand it, Ne is about seeing possibilities, coming up with multiple interpretations, and then reaching a conclusion. I don’t really do that naturally, when that happens its when im trying to look for one direction,  i take in peoples words then think 'yes i should be navigating life this way.' . I usually take other people’s opinions, explain what happened to me, and say something like, “this happened, so I should probably do this,” and then other people expand on it for me.

For example, I have a friend who’s an ENFP, cognitivly it was easier to just tell she was one. I remember trauma dumping once, this happens when a problem comes up with people, at the moment i know how to speak up, but after im like when it has an actual grasp of my future or something or consequences that could lead to ppl actually leaving me, she immediately started giving multiple examples, perspectives, and solutions. I ended up getting overwhelmed and kind of airy, because just how do you follow these things without second guessing it, it's just to complicated to apply within my life, seems unreal.

My brain couldn’t really process it, but I still nodded along. When I watch mindset videos she recommends, I usually forget them right after. Most of what they say feels like common sense that just confirms what I already know, rather than changing how I think.

What made me question whether my typing comes more from my current personality than how I naturally functioned with social phobia and anxiety in the past. I do seem scattered and indecisive, but mostly when I’m stressed or trying to figure something out. I overexplain things to look for direction, then end up going with the flow anyway. I adapt a lot to my environment, appearance is crucial, I need someone looking to actually move, I need convos happening to actually keep me going. Libraries make me study, university and friends make me talkative, and my room feels like a place where I can just do whatever I want, joking around online or doing impulsive things just for fun, like drinking seven cups of coffee and posting about it.

When I first went to university, my social anxiety was still strong. From middle school through high school, social phobia made my mind feel foggy. I was hyper-aware of people’s expressions and what they meant. I spent a lot of time alone, and even eating in public made me anxious. I also forgot things easily, even recent events, so when people started conversations, I mostly responded based on what they said rather than my own input. Sometimes it felt like I was listening but not fully processing their words, more focused on the interaction itself than the content.

Now I’m extremely talkative. I talk a lot, even here. These days it feels more about doing things than being motivated by something specific. I don’t really need motivation, and not much actually motivates me. When I study, it’s just learning in the moment, not thinking about future outcomes. Even when my parents said I’d earn a lot of money in a certain field, my thoughts stayed practical and immediate, like “oh, I could work in that country,” or “people are going there in the future, right?” It felt more like confirming information than feeling driven by it.

My studying habits also depend heavily on environment. If I’m with friends, I end up socializing. If I’m in a library, studying becomes the default activity, almost like the distraction itself. Study methods I considered rarely mattered; I just adapted to wherever I was and just started reading.

Another reason people typed me as Ne is that I used to write poems and create story ideas. But that creativity usually came when I was bored or avoiding something else. I’d think of a metaphor and then write about what it could mean, but it often felt shallow or overly wordy, and I’d lose interest quickly. People also say I’m funny, but more in situations where something goes wrong and I laugh about it. Even getting a bad mark makes me think, “what the hell, I studied,” rather than immediately worrying about my future. Only later do I think about getting yelled at.

I also notice that when I hear something interesting, I’ll bring it up to someone and say, “have you heard about this?” Then I’ll repeat something I saw in comments or somewhere else as a possible explanation, because it seems true. Sometimes I realize immediately that it wasn’t appropriate to present it as a reason, I was just trying to expand the conversation because I didn’t have a clear opinion myself.

I know I’m still changing. Looking back at my typings now, I can tell that a lot of what people identified might have actually been mental struggles rather than personality traits. I’m changing fast enough that it’s hard to keep up. I wonder why I suddenly became more extroverted, why I seek attention more, and why I rant online to strangers. For most of my life, I was aimless even in situations that should have given me direction or motivation, all id think about was 'appearance and keep ur grades up' nothing else that seemed profound.

The only times I felt strongly affected were when I lost a friend group or felt like my appearance and personality didn’t fit in.

At this point, I feel like I might drop typing altogether, since I’m starting to notice patterns that matter more in real life than labels. It feels more useful to focus on what’s in front of me instead of trying to define things that haven’t fully developed yet. I might be stressed, overexplaining stuff that's happened to get one answer but when there's another answer I seem so focused on it.

I post on my close friends list but it's always about something that happened, an experience that I then turned into a joke. Me eating spicy food, instantly regretting it then turning it into 'almost died js now, my spice tolerance is cooked.' or 'ohmygod I overheard someone behind me talking about marriage and her friends were all like saying 'are u stupid'.' This is exactly how I've noticed I conversate in person and on my social media stories. my university has a confession page and I made a joke about 'Can the confession page js get a journal atp, i have diagnosed atleast 10 ppl so far 🙏' jokes like these. even in labs I'm usually the one being like 'ok go do this, I'll answer these.' like giving people direction, in group projects I'm able to break things down so that ppl actually have stuff to do, do I end up forgetting my part? unfortunately so but I gave thus solution now do as u will LMAO, because they overthink things saying 'meeting meeting meeting oh wait I'm busy what do we do.' it's so easy to js say 'we have a group chat, what was the objective of that meeting? oh this? alright then just do it and have it done by this.' simple. let's say something happened idk like I was studying and then people start talking I would then post ' this girls laugh beside me sounds like a megaphone, fuckass loudmouths, you see a person studying and think 'let me increase my volume real quick' holy hell I hope your vocal cords catch up to you in 5 years and you end up mute.'  anyways that's the personality, how I speak or whatever it is.

Even small things show this, my parents ask me to get something, I say “okay,” walk downstairs, and immediately forget what they said but I wasn’t really thinking about anything at all, I just got distracted by my phone or something.

I’ve also had periods where I go to sleep thinking about something intensely like 'is there like an answer to what they said', sometimes to the point of insomnia, waking up hours later still thinking about it without even being sure what the thought was.

So for now, I think I might just be more on the sensing side than intuitive, but that’s something I’ll probably understand better over time.

edit 1: forgot to explain, it’s not friendships I’m necessarily affected by, it’s the fallout of not having anyone after, it’s like what the fck who do I spend time with and talk to now. It’s like u start missing people and you just want to keep things okay for the sake of just wanting to interact.

edit 2: found out I could really study anywhere but I get distracted easily which is why libraries are efficient, but at the moment if it’s jsut like ‘read or js do this.’ Like remembering I’m like ‘oh why not.’ At the moment if I find myself maladaptive daydreaming and I’m like ‘I could exercise rn’ so I’m like ‘ok I’ll js do it.’",1,1770982049.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

1r3mnz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r3mnz5/for_sale/,For Sale,"“I’ve been here before, haven’t I?” 

It was the first thought I had. An instinct that had crept across my thoughts like a roach scurrying from the light. It formed as the car idled with me stapled into the rear seat, cheek pressed against the warm pane, lazily peering at the sign that read “Belgrano Estates”. In retrospect it was an apt introduction to the neighbourhood.

The twinge of familiarity brought me to attention. A shiny metal gate glided noiselessly until it was open wide. The yellow taxi slid down the asphalt like a stick of butter on a hot skillet.

My stomach gurgled, and the sound peeked through the gaps in my buttoned shirt. The distinction between hunger and apprehension was vague within my guts. My windows were optical illusions, birthing looping rows of perfectly set houses; whiter than cheap veneers with crowns sharp enough to part overcast skies. The charge of my pulse against my flesh told me this could be the one. I gripped the handle of my door and readied myself for the next tour.

The answer was no, I hadn’t been there before, but it was easy to get confused.

 House hunting had been a languid affair. My body grew weary from the constant chewing and regurgitation from one suburb to the next, dragged through the entrails of two-bedroom, three-bathroom estates, so hollow and vapid the shadows they cast could’ve housed me the same.

The true blue sky shined through a cracked lip in the window. A breeze slipped in, and I breathed it, closing my eyes. No birdsong wandered in with the wind.

The ride through the hall of mirrors persisted; the sight gained a hypnotic quality, and I retreated to the rearview to take my first professional glimpse of the woman riding in the passenger seat. 

She wore a tight pink blouse tucked into a long formal skirt, her pale knee rested gingerly atop the other, and a briefcase balanced over her lap. The smooth slope of her chin angled delicately toward the stream of homes passing by. We had exchanged only brief pleasantries before entering the cab, so it wasn’t until then, when she was still enough to be a statue, deep in thought, that I noticed just how beautiful Emiko was.

It was a beauty beyond lust. The kind that you would use to describe a symphony or a painting. Her skin glowed like a captured memory, and I sat there wondering if God had sculpted her with something better than flesh.

A second thought gloomed around the reflection of her perfected presence: what exactly had made my last realtor give up on me? 

Her black opal eyes shifted to meet mine in the rearview, and their porcelain frame followed. Paradoxically, we moved towards the same destination, yet faced each other. Her gaze was a tide that pulled and pulled until words fell from my lips.

“What’s the difference between a realtor and a real estate agent?” Even before the question was out, I cursed heaven and earth in my thoughts. Her black opals lowered slightly as she considered, then ascended once more to overwhelm me.

 “Ethics,” she answered in a tone that told me she had explored every facet of the question.

 I nodded. My last realtor had given a different answer, but just as curt.

The noise of the engine filled the space where conversation usually exists. Nothing was said until the driver pulled into a concrete driveway, flicked off his meter, and turned to me, stating, “That’ll be 32 dollars, sir.”

I nodded once more and paid in cash before exiting the cab at the same time as Emiko.​

I had chosen my last real estate agent, Lacey, on account of her large breasts.

The day I met her I had strolled into a real estate office intent on being difficult. Intent on a prompt rejection so that I could return home and resume living in the carcass of a dead marriage.

 When I reached the front desk and cocked my head at the secretary, she looked at me like chum in the water. The sheet of paper floated over the marble countertop and into my palms.

Running my eyes down the form, I was whittled back into a dejected man. The answer to each question carved sloppy chunks off my deluded grandeur. I returned to the front desk and slid the form back with answers missing; her eyes smiled. She made no effort to hide her sadism.

If Lacey had been one minute later to work, she could’ve seen me leaving. If she had stopped for a pleasant slice of small talk on her way into the office, or if the traffic had been just partially more congested, she’d have missed me completely.

As she set her coat on the hanger in her office and took another sweet sip from her cup of vanilla coffee, Lacey’s boss greeted her and spoke my name into the air, tying us together with a metaphysical thread; a thread that could only be untangled.

 She came to get me from the waiting room. Her heels clicked towards me, and when I turned to face them, the sound of my own name burned in my ears. Her red lips smiled at me, and her blue eyes summoned me forward. I followed behind, studying the blond hair resting in a bun at the top of her head. I imagined her folding the golden tangle like origami.

It wasn’t until we sat down that I noticed her breasts. They peeked over her desk and whispered for my attention. Before I could hear the faff of the fan going in her office, or even feel its chill, I knew it was on. Lacey’s nipples protested beneath the silk fabric. 

Throughout our conversation, the heat from her speech would melt my gaze, and my sight would spill clumsily over her shirt. I’d force it upwards, and there she would be meeting my glance, unphased with her full lips still in motion. Her magnetism blurred memories and intentions. The aperture of her eyes flickered along with my answers; she smiled charmingly and feigned being charmed by me. It was there, with my skull overflowing from flattery, that the decision to hire her landed in my mind like bird shit plummeting from the sky.

Not a decision born from any delusion that I might enchant her with visions of a thinning-haired knight in armour, or seduce her with the jaded charm of a middle-aged divorcee. That could have been admirable.

My intentions came from a more immature and spiteful place. The kind of shameful satisfaction only the newly divorced can understand. The bitter kind that I’d feel knowing my ex-wife would see Lacey picking me up every day.

​

With our feet driven into the pavement of the sidewalk, Emiko and I took in the house separately. It was the mirror image of the house to our backs and virtually identical to its neighbours. My inspection started with the lawn. A pool of decadence, it glowed emerald with drops of dew rested atop the blades of grass like accent diamonds. Freshly sprinkled brilliance, groomed to the perfect 4 inches of height; everywhere except for where the sign stood.

Down the “For Sale” sign, my eyes traced where its legs stamped the dirt. Around the two picket pillars lodged deep into the soil, where a lawn mower would have the most trouble trimming, slender fingers of grass reached upwards. I followed their coils, and stopped halfway up the sign. The house had been on the market for some time.

It was an odd detail. Suburban neighbourhoods are Orwellian in the sense that even nature must adhere to their aesthetic. Blemishes on lawns were the rumblings of rebellion; a desire for chaos beginning to chip through.

My eyes ventured forward. The face of the house was a picturesque shell for the American dream to crawl into. White walls were so pale they made me squint. Windows shined a dull gray from the pulled curtains inside. Beside the door, in a slick Roman font, read the number “17.”

 I sighed, well versed in the monotony. My first step overtook my guide. Turning to Emiko, I could tell I had missed something.

 She seemed reverent toward the house, standing there with both hands clasped together against her stomach. Her head tilted up to it, her mouth slightly agape. Emiko breathed and it was carried away by the wind as her eyes traced each floor from left to right, like she was reading the pages of a book. I turned back to get a better look. No sooner did I shudder.

On my second glance, the walls had darkened. The grey windows hid an eerie depth. The structure seemed taller, more looming, as if it had leaned forward while I was turned.

For the first time in two months, a house had piqued my interest.

​

Vindictive eagerness kept me awake the night before Lacey’s first day. I squirmed on the corduroy couch of the basement until six in the morning, finally giving up on the notion of appearing rested.

 My feet startled the house awake as I creaked my way up the wooden staircase. My toes played the wooden floorboards like piano keys, tiptoeing into the kitchen. A deep purple sky spread across the window above the sink, and chastised me. The sky was heating up; ripples of light shuddered from below the horizon, and soon it would all be set ablaze.

 The dishes sleeping on the drying rack were bone dry. I plucked my mate gourd and straw from the crowd and set them down on the island.

Pulled by the string of routine, I was a puppet performing across the kitchen. I switched the kettle on, and it roared behind me. The cabinet creaked, and I plunged my fist into the dark, removing a crinkling bag of yerba.

I wasn’t fussy with my mate. I sank the metal straw into the gourd and buried it halfway with a generous portion of yerba. When the kettle lost some of its breath, I filled my thermos with the steaming water.

The first bird chirped outside, and my eyes went to the window. Clouds hung like smoke over the horizon, swelling with the colour of the inevitable fire threatening to erupt. Hearing my commotion, the first embers of sunlight frothed over the horizon.

I drowned the yerba in water and took my first sip; the powder I didn’t shake off stiffened my throat. While the sun came out, my mixture turned flat against the litres of water strained through it.

My ex-wife greeted me at seven in the morning with tired eyes that told me she had fought more stubbornly for sleep and met the same result.

We absorbed the daily news through our phone screens in silence. The crunch of her burnt toast against her teeth made my stomach growl, but I remained seated out of fear that any sudden movement might cause us to accidentally speak.

After half an hour, she breached no man’s land.

“When’s the realtor coming to pick you up?” she asked. I could feel her stare waiting on me while my face remained angled down at the phone.

 “Any minute now,” I answered, looking up. She nodded, turning away before our eyes could reunite.

Those days, it seemed that whenever our eyes would rut, a thousand words were spoken: betraying guilt, betraying sadness, rage, acceptance, callousness. I watched the steam flow from my mate and remembered how she used to drink it with me. How her face would scrunch when the liquid assaulted her tongue, and she’d still pretend to enjoy it.

 “Would you like some?” I asked, sliding the gourd forward.

 She looked down at it and shook her head.

When Lacey arrived ten minutes later, I had already begun to lose confidence in my own sense of humour. I watched her exit her car from the living room window. Her hands smoothed the creases of her skirt, and she strolled confidently towards the front door.

The outfit she wore was form-fitting, her breasts pushed against the fabric of her shirt in a playful show of will. My cheeks burned watching them nod in succession with her strut, and I winced at the sound of her heels on our porch. Shame pooled around my face.

I rushed to the entrance before she could tap her slender knuckles on the oak door. Her hand was cold against mine; I greeted her and joined her outside, letting her know I was ready to go.

Her eyes widened when she saw me. Perhaps it was my purple eyebags and the bloodshot pool my pupils floated in, or maybe it was the blinding pace of my second impression, but I made no effort to reassure her.

We walked back to her car, where I opened the door for her, like a madman trying to put smoke back into a grenade. I shut the door and looked up at the house where my ex-wife’s silhouette watched me from our old bedroom. She waved us away. Behind the pane, her smile looked genuine.​

“Mr. Elias,” Emiko’s voice rang out firmly from behind me. I turned and looked at her. Her posture had grown rigid, her eyes intense. “You cannot enter that house.”

She was right; it didn’t take sharp instincts to see that the estate before us was a wolf.

 “There are other homes in this neighbourhood that I can take you to,” Emiko stated. She eyed me suspiciously. My smile made her uneasy.

“I’d like a tour of this one,” I said softly. Her face remained beautiful even as it fell.

“Mr. Elias—”

“Thomas, please.”

“Thomas.” She paused to form the sentence in her head first. “There is something off about this home. Something outright evil. There’s malice in the air.” Every word she uttered was spoken as a matter of fact. Yet, she uttered them as if she suspected they’d never sway me.

I nodded. Her honesty was impressive and made me recall her answer in the car. “I understand that, but I’d still like a tour,” I responded.

Her eyes studied me more generously than they had before. She nodded. “You can tour the property if you’d like, but I will give you the key, and you will have to give yourself the tour. Any questions you have about the property, I will answer them here.”

 My laughs bounced off her like she was stone. “That is reasonable,” I replied.

She bowed her head and handed me the key. When I took it in my hand, I was surprised by its weight. It pushed down on the flesh of my palm, indenting itself on the lines that seemingly held my fate.

I approached the snarling wolf. My heart thumped tentatively as each step isolated me further from Emiko. The path splitting the lawn funnelled me towards the front door, where I sank my key into the lock and twisted the blade. A metallic click echoed from within the door. My fingers trembled, reaching out. The brass knob turned in my hand, and the door groaned with pleasure as I pushed it aside.

Sunlight blasted the interior. The shadows scurried away into their crevices, and the beams flowing around my silhouette painted a hollow entrance that sprawled into several rooms.

I crossed the threshold and turned back to Emiko. She was beside the mailbox; her jaw clenched, chewing on nerves as she watched. I shut the door between us.

It looked like the same barren houses I’d been to before, only presented in a different sequence. My feet carried me carefully over the wood floor. I swept through each empty room, feeling with every sense for the malice I had been warned about.

 I flicked the lights of each room I crossed into to give Emiko an indication of how long I’d be. Birds chirped outside, cars drove by, and everything smelled of fresh paint and sawdust. I passed my reflection on the marble counters of the kitchen; my disappointment shined clear.

In the dull light of a corridor at the back of the house, I found that it led to nothing, simply a white plaster wall at the end of the hall. Still, I flicked a light switch to get a better view. The light bulb made a high cracking sound before a flash of white ignited the darkness. Glass hit the ground in already shattered pieces. The flash was devoured by the starving hallway.

 An afterimage from the ball of light moved around in the shadows, and I found myself backing away towards the staircase.

The steps on the staircase muttered underneath my feet. The birds chirped again, and more cars drove by. I crossed the hallways to find myself in the main bedroom. My feet traced the edges of the room while I imagined an endless stream of mornings. Memories of my old routine imposed themselves into the room, and an immense sadness filled my heart; I retreated to the window.

 Emiko waited out on the street, her glare fixed on the front door. Birds chirped. Cars passed and I looked out at an empty street.

 The engine roared inside a phantom car on the desolate street. The bird’s song had a consistent duration and pattern. Two short whistles followed by a longer, beckoning one.

I watched the road, counting for exactly two minutes and thirty seconds. Birds chirped their monotonous melody. Invisible cars drove by. I counted again, this time out loud. At exactly one hundred and fifty seconds, I was cut off by the sound of chirping birds and passing cars. The streets remained empty and the sky vast and blue, devoid of life.

For the entire car ride, Lacey had the misfortune of conversing with the mouth of a cave. Her voice scratched the walls of my consciousness, and I responded with echoes of conversation.

My ex-wife’s smile had turned my shame to steam. I passed through each house that day like a vapour, thinking only of my ex-wife and that benevolent smile. Of the final two house tours of the day, I can only recall my vivid fantasies of setting fire to the Mona Lisa.

My ex-wife’s smile on touring days became a new obsession.

I crafted a thesis in my head, moving through the bare walls that outlined rooms. A convincing smile spread across a piece of canvas is merely the product of paint and handiness with a brush; it can be destroyed easily. A smile like a river connecting both sides of the face is an intricate series of muscles, synapses, and hormones that is much more difficult to quell.

 For weeks, it haunted me as I paraded Lacey around. For weeks, after each greeting, wave, and smile, I wondered if my ex-wife had always been the perfect image of cordiality.

After the first month, my ex-wife had started to invite Lacey into the house to shower her with the biscuits and coffee we kept reserved at the top shelf of our pantry. My own hell burned hotter with each passing day, and I seemed to grasp less and less of the houses Lacey toured me through.

When I had given up on making my ex-wife exhibit any jealousy, it was simply the notion of her smile that rattled me. How it loomed behind me, or expected me home with the news that I was moving out; it picked away at my attention like crows on a corpse.

Finally, after thirty houses, on the first day of our second month of searching, I unexpectedly found Emiko at the door that morning.

I must have exited the house looking ill, because Emiko’s opal eyes glinted with pity when her gaze found mine. She looked penitent, as if ashamed by her own callousness in letting me stroll into the wolf’s mouth.

 “Mr. Elia—Thomas,” she corrected herself, “I can take you home if you’d like.”

 I shook my head, “I would like to purchase this one.” My voice came out frail and jittery.

 Emiko now looked at me as if I’d just stepped from the shadows to reveal myself.

“Lacey told me that you were uninterested in buying a house.”

 “Lacey was correct, until now.” Professionalism didn’t allow her to scoff. She stared into my eyes; her opals twinkled, and I saw the moment she was satisfied.

Her face hardened, and her vocal cords froze. “If that’s your decision,” she stated.

 “It is,” I replied. My voice had layered with a pity of its own; Emiko had transformed into a vision of my ex-wife. She sensed it and recoiled. Her gaze twisted away, lush with anger. The clips on her briefcase cracked like lightning, and she handed me some papers with calculated coldness.

No words were uttered while I signed for the house. Emiko’s glare singed holes in my skull as the nib of my pen lifted with a flourish from the final sheet of paper. She departed with measured professionalism, leaving me with my final question of the day: 

Where does one buy crucifixes?

1r3mnrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1r3mnrb/the_stability_of_your_times_isaiah_336/,The Stability of Your Times: Isaiah 33:6,"“He is the stability of your times; An abundance of salvation, wisdom, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah —This is his treasure.” (Isaiah 33:6)

This verse would make a good year text too, given how unstable life is. Maybe one unfine year it will be one. It includes an emphasis Bible reading, study, and meditation, since the goods don’t come through osmosis. Though, to some extent they do, if you immerse yourself in the atmosphere. And it’s a “treasure” to get “wisdom.” Though “knowledge” may be gained through science, it doesn’t deliver much on the “wisdom” front. Moreover, on the “salvation” front, if anything, it tells us that our goose is cooked.

As to stability, a circuit overseer used to tell how he would get carsick as a boy. This resonates with me because I used to get carsick as a boy also. Our family’s solution was to stick me in the passenger seat where it was less likely to happen, relegating mom to the back seat with my two younger siblings. I grew up thinking that was just the way it was with families, and was surprised to ride with friends whose moms were doing it wrong, sitting up front.

The circuit overseer never displaced his mom as a boy. His directive, given him in the back seat, was: “Look as far off into the distance as you can. Do not shift that gaze.” It’s the one thing that does not change that would save him. It was a good dry run for how he would later be looking to God in times of instability—his nature and principles do not change, amidst a chaotic earthly backdrop in which everything changes.

The times today, they are unstable. Then, it was threat of the encroaching Assyrians. Today, many threats encroach, often more vague with unsure consequences. “The Future’s So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades” became a hit song in the 80s. They sing it at graduations, even though the songwriters said the shades and brightness were an allusion to how nuclear war might end it all. 

And how fretful should people be, for another example, that 75% of insects (by biomass) have dissappered in the last 30 years? This, according to a 2017 German study, and it mirrors findings in birdlife. Should that be a cause for alarm or should it be dismissed as one of those things? Anyone my age knew this and often said it, due to the bug splatter you used to have to clear off your summer windshields but no longer do. This was “anecdotal,” however, and the great thinkers were dubious of it without measurements.

On the other hand, they keep churning out the goods at Costco. As I dine on my hot dog and soda, still one dollar and fifty cents (though I wouldn’t want to subsist on them), satiated customers with fully loaded carts stream out of the store as though on a conveyor belt, an incredible feat.

The 33rd chapter explores how Israel would fare in the face of the Assyrian threat and how those looking to God would escape. The climax is the last verse: 

“And no resident will say: “I am sick.” The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.” (33:24)

Whatever the then-ramifications, whenever in the Bible one reads of those “pardoned for their error,” one thinks of the Great Pardoner. Jesus even connected being pardoned with being free of sickness when he told the paralyzed man his sins were forgiven. Religious honchos huffed over just who he thought he was, a man who could forgive sins.  He proved the point by telling the man to pick up his mat and walk. 

(“When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic: “Child, your sins are forgiven.”  Now some of the scribes were there, sitting and reasoning in their hearts: “Why is this man talking this way? He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?”  But immediately Jesus discerned by his spirit that they were reasoning that way among themselves, so he said to them: “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?  Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’? But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth—” he said to the paralytic: “I say to you, Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.” At that he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of them all.“ — Mark 2:5-12)

He is the Son of God, given authority even to forgive sins. Likely foreshadowed at Isaiah 33:17–“Your eyes will behold a king in his splendor,” as it begins to become apparent just God will save in modern times. It’s by means of this Son appointed king. Sometimes this dawns on people gradually. Sometimes it hits like a thunderbolt, and may account for Thomas’s exclamation: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20;28) a revelation of the Lord and a praise of the God who reveals him. 

I should have a nickel for everyone who has declared that Thomas is equating the two. It’s a valid view of that verse alone, and may even be the first interpretation that comes to mind, but it doesn’t fit the overall picture. Two things are mentioned, so that means they are the same? Not to trivialize the point, but I stopped at Dunkin the other day and ordered a coffee and donut. The clerk handed me two separate items. They may commonly go together, nobody would ever say that they are the same.

Any reason that Thomas could not be exclaiming ‘My Lord!’ having just identified him, and then equally marveling at ‘my God’ who brings it about? It would fit 33:22 of Isaiah: 

“For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Lawgiver, Jehovah is our King; He is the One who will save us.” With the revealing of his Son, we see just how he will accomplish those things with people. You praise the Son, but you praise the Father even more. 

“The Father is greater than the Son,” says John 14:28. It’s no more complicated than that. It is a fact, though, that when my friend John Cuggan displayed the booklet ‘The Word: Who is He According to John?’ at this workplace, a booklet that left a sizable gap below the title, his born-again co-workers filled the space with his last name: ‘The Word: Who Was He, According to John Cuggan?’

I do appreciate the slow pacing, but it is just too much at times with this film. On the contrary, I do think that the pacing works much better than in GBU, which I have always thought of as a fast-paced action movie trapped in a slog of a film. The slow pacing fits the mood and the story so well with OUATINW, so I was sure to remove only the most superfluous moments.

My version improves the overall focus of the story, while maintaining the same slow pace and somber mood as the original without feeling like a chore to sit through. Moreover, the removal of certain scenes makes the story more impactful. The runtime of my edit is 148 minutes, compared to the original's 166 minutes, a much lighter cut than my GBU edit.

CHANGES:

\-I reworked the opening train station sequence entirely, cutting around ten minutes and changing the order of some shots, as well as doing some sound mixing to make sure everything was perfect. I cropped out any opening credits that appeared on-screen and moved them to the end of the film, where I put my own end credits. This was the scene with the most cuts, and now the rest of the film feels much more focused. The original opening scene is liable to take some viewers out of the film before it really even begins.

Harmonica is not seen rising in my version, making his re-appearance in the tavern much more impactful. It is debated that this is what Leone intended in his original international theatrical cut of the film; however, because the US cut added the scene of Harmonica rising due to the removal of the tavern scene, it got mixed in with other future releases of the film. There is no proof that there was any version without the ""Harmonica rising scene"", except word of mouth and forum posts. I think most will agree that the film works better without it.

\-The entire hunting sequence with Brett and Timmy McBain has been removed. After Harmonica is shot in the opening sequence, we cut to Maureen preparing for the wedding party.

\-The long shot of Jill lying on the bed and staring off into the distance in the bedroom has been removed. It drags on.

\-Another long shot of Jill which drags on too long, her staring into the mirror, has been cut. The transition scene which led up to that shot has been silenced, with a wind sound effect being added due to the music in the scene not fitting the cut. The wind sound effect carries over until Jill opens the door.

\-Cheyenne's warning about Harmonica in their initial meeting has been removed. The dialogue doesn't make sense, as Cheyenne talks about Harmonica like Jill didn't see the confrontation between the two in the tavern. The cut comes as Jill is putting a lid on a pot of coffee, so I had to add that sound to the next shot.

\-Harmonica's first two flashbacks have been cut. This makes the last flashback during the duel much more powerful and impactful.

High-beat 28,800 bph movement, classic integrated 70s case, and that tight linen texture that reads soft cream at a glance — but in person leans warm café au lait. It’s refined, balanced, almost understated until the light hits it.

Second is the 5206-6080 “Phe Sữa” Coffee Dial.

1r3mh4r,https://i.redd.it/ks56ucpmu8jg1.jpeg,[Development Update 2] Satisfactory Layouts,"Hi Pioneers!

It’s Friday again, so I thought it was time for another update of [**satisfactory-layouts.com**](https://www.satisfactory-layouts.com)!

I’ve been working really hard on the project lately, and I’m excited to share what’s new.

# What has been added?

**Stability / Fixes / Improvements**

* Various fixes for Firefox
* Refactored parts of the codebase to prepare for upcoming features
* Help cursor now only appears on non-occupied ports
* Right mouse button panning now has a larger movement threshold

**Features**

* **25% Zoom Level Added**
   * Zoom levels are now 25%, 50% and 100%
   * Zooming works a bit differently: the Z key has been replaced by `-` and `=` to zoom in/out at your mouse position
   * Toolbar zoom controls work the same, but can now go one step further
* **Custom Keybinds**
   * You can now bind buildables to keys 0–9
   * Open the build menu (`Q`) and enter “keybind mode”
   * While active, hover a buildable and press a number key to bind it
   * Don’t forget to exit keybind mode to use the keybinds normally
* **Recently Used Buildables**
   * The first category in the build menu is now **Last Used**
   * Shows up to 8 recently placed buildables
* **Marquee Measurement Tool**
   * The marquee selection box now doubles as a measurement tool
   * Displays size in both foundations and meters
* **Paint Grid Mode (G)**
   * You can now paint directly onto the grid, visible across all floors
   * Some example uses:
      * Create foundation guides to line up machines across floors
      * Mark build constraints to make sure your factory fits
      * Highlight or organize factory sections

# What am I currently working on?

* Blueprints (reuse machine setups across layouts)
* Investigating proper mobile support
* Exploring a backend system so we can:
   * Log in from different devices and access all designs
   * Share designs more easily
   * Save preferences like keybinds, recently used machines, and blueprints

# Blueprints are coming soon!

This is a powerful addition because it allows you to save groups of machines and reuse them across different layouts, removing a lot of repetitive work. Instead of rebuilding the same setups over and over, you’ll be able to drop in predefined sections quickly, making large-scale planning faster, cleaner, and much more flexible.

# About the future direction

As the project grows and more advanced features are explored — especially things like accounts, syncing, and sharing — it also raises some bigger questions about sustainability and how to support ongoing development long-term.

Right now, I only have a [“Buy Me a Coffee” page for donations](https://buymeacoffee.com/SatisfactoryLayouts). My goal has always been to keep the tool accessible to everyone, without intrusive ads like many other calculators, while hopefully receiving enough support to keep it sustainable. I’m currently spending most of my free time working on this, which — as you probably know — can get exhausting. Ideally, it would be great to reduce my regular work hours just a tiny bit in the future, so I can spend more focused time on the project while still keeping a healthy balance with family life.

Adding a backend means significantly higher hosting costs, since much of what currently runs locally would move to the server. If it’s built properly — with accounts, syncing, and reliable infrastructure — those costs become ongoing and unavoidable. Because of that, I’m considering whether a small optional monthly subscription could make sense to help cover hosting and keep development sustainable, while still keeping the tool clean and free from ads. I’d really like to hear how you all feel about that direction.

I’d love to hear your thoughts!

My German is limited, definitely not enough to become friends with some type of deep connection with anyone. (I don’t need to be reminded to improve it, I’m working on it).

1r3mh1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r3mh1j/is_a_semi_automatic_machine_the_right_choice_for/,Is a semi automatic machine the right choice for me? [Budget € 1000 - 2500],"Hello everyone (sorry for the long text),

For the past 14 years, we've been using fully automatic Jura.

Lately it's been experiencing problems so soon it will need replacing. We use this machine almost exclusively for making our 4 cups of espresso a day. We don't use the built-in milk functions because you have to constantly rinse the pipes. For frothing milk for our (rather rare) cappuccinos, we use a Sage (Breville) The Milk Café. And another thing I don't like about the Jura is that it's never really clean.

The question now is which type of machine I'll buy next.  
The coffee we drink at some local coffee shops is very often better than the coffee from our Jura, so a semi-automatic coffee machine and a good grinder seems to be the best choice.  
But my espresso is not something I want to be all to fanatical about. Figuring out what works well and repeating it, that's what I think it would be. Some YT clips give me the impression that you have to be almost an engineer to get a good cup of espresso (lol)

Long ago (the 1990s), I worked in a restaurant in my city (Bruges, Belgium). When I picture a semi-automatic coffee machine now, I think of the professional multi-group machine used there back then. The process was simple: grind the coffee, tamp it, insert the portafilter, and turn it on.  
But of course, there's been much more focus on quality in coffee since those days.

Why am I looking for a semi-automatic coffee machine? I assume my espresso will go a step ahead; the result is more controllable; and a half automatic machine — with proper maintenance — also seems like a more sustainable purchase. I'm 67, so a machine that can function well for another 15 or 20 years will probably be my last. By which I also mean that I'd rather buy something solid now than one that I'll have or want to replace in a few years.

Is a semi-automatic coffee machine with a separate grinder really the best option for me? I'am hoping it will be a step up from our fully automatic, but there is some concern that everything is becoming too cumbersome.  
What's also an extra advantage for us: a semi-automatic machine simply looks much better on the kitchen counter.

From what I have read till now, a good grinder and a basic machine would be the obvious choice, but  then the question arises: will my use also evolve with a better machine that offers more options (more milk drinks, for example)?

All in all, the budget is around €2500. If the right choice is cheaper, all the better. If it needs to be a bit more expensive, that's also worth considering.

[Intro – Calypso shuffle, banjo plinking like it’s late for a meeting]  
Alarm ringin’ like it’s got no shame  
Banjo strummin’ like, “Bro, who’s to blame?”  
Sun outside sayin’, “Come play, come play…”  
But my job say, “Nope — get back in the fray.”

[Verse 1 – Easy, sunny, fed‑up]
Shirt half‑ironed, coffee on my sleeve  
Boss blowin’ up my phone like I can’t leave  
Train so packed I’m breathin’ someone’s dream  
And it ain’t mine — it’s a corporate scheme  

Fluorescent lights hum a funeral tune  
Break room fridge smellin’ like last June  
Meetings on meetings, all déjà vu  
Banjo pluckin’ like, “Man, they playin’ you…”

---

[Chorus – Everybody sway, everybody complain]
I hate work… but it love me strong  
Holdin’ me hostage all day long  
I hate work… but I’m back by nine  
Sellin’ my hours for a nickel and a sign  

I hate work… same loop, same day  
Paycheck hit, then it floats away  
I hate work… but the sun don’t care  
It’s dancin’ outside while I rot in this chair

---

[Verse 2 – Calypso grin, banjo sass]
Casual Friday, still no chill  
Same fake jokes, same dollar‑store thrill  
“Team is family!” — that’s rich talk  
They’d trade my soul for a share of stock  

Bathroom break just to breathe a bit  
Scrollin’ memes like a survival kit  
Banjo chucklin’ like it knows the score  
“Bruh, you’ve been here since ’94…”

---

[Chorus – Bigger, brighter, more fed‑up]
I hate work… but it love me strong  
Keeps on callin’ like I did somethin’ wrong  
I hate work… got me glued to this chair  
Clock hands laughin’ like they happy I’m there  

I hate work… but I’m back by nine  
Sellin’ my time for somebody’s shine  
I hate work… same loop, new day  
Paycheck hit… then it floats away

🌞 [Rap Breakdown – Sunny beat, banjo doing attitude riffs]
(Beat drops to a Calypso‑trap hybrid, steel drum hits on the off‑beats)  

Yo—  
I said work got claws like a needy ex  
Textin’ me “U up?” when I’m tryna rest  
Got me tappin’ spreadsheets like a sad lil’ drum  
While my dreams outside yellin’, “Bro, you comin’ or what?”  

I’m a cubicle pirate, stealin’ back my joy  
HR talkin’ ‘bout “culture”—that’s a decoy  
I’m plannin’ my breakout, jailbreak chic  
Gonna ghost this job by the end of the week  

Banjo in the corner like plink‑plink‑plink  
Steel drum laughin’ like think‑think‑think  
Sunshine shoutin’, “Come taste this breeze!”  
And I’m like… “One more check, then I’m finally free.”

---

[Final Chorus – Calypso carnival energy]
I hate work… but it love me tight  
Tryna keep me here till I lose my light  
I hate work… but I’m changin’ my fate  
One day soon… they gon’ miss this face  

I hate work… but the sky’s still blue  
And the banjo say, “Do what you gotta do…”  
I hate work… but I’m breakin’ away

This person interviewed me for a role but my skillset wasn’t suited for the role. He being a very nice person, he took the effort and referred me for a different role which suited my profile (mind you this role wasn’t advertised on website, he took the effort of reaching out to heads of different teams). This all happened virtually, then I got hired in this role and moved to Mumbai for same. I wanted to meet him for coffee to thank him. 

He was busy and tbh did not show interest. I have never showed interest in colleagues as I was afraid of the implications. However, when I saw him in cafeteria for the first time I was smitten. Don’t know if it’s the looks or maybe because of the calm demeanour he exuded. Very introvert just speaking what was required. Again he did not really make an effort of talking, which I wanted to as he was the only person who I knew in office and in city. 

I found it a bit offending, I thought he might be ignoring so I started ignoring as well. 

Then one day he messaged me asking if I want to be a part of exclusive community in office that invites speakers. I was confused that this guy never shows interest but then chooses me to be a part of his team. I used to attend meetings but he never even looked at me, lol. Again I started ignoring. 

Recently, he wanted me to host the entire event because he was busy ( again just few lines on teams). I did because I wanted to. Now the day comes for the event, for the first time we talked beyond one line. I don’t know I just felt like looking at him and weird admiration even when a part of me hates him because of ignorance. 

Post which, we went for the lunch with speaker later that day, again he did not talk but one weird action made my day. We ordered food, everyone completed the bowl of rice as the bowl was more closer to them. This guy sitting the farthest from me, asked me if I wanted the last serving. Damn, the gesture.

First is the 5216-8020 “Flatwhite Linen.”
High-beat 28,800 bph movement, classic integrated 70s case, and that tight linen texture that reads soft cream at a glance — but in person leans warm café au lait. It’s refined, balanced, almost understated until the light hits it.

Second is the 5206-6080 “Phe Sua” Coffee Dial.
This one carries a deeper roasted tone. Less airy, more grounded. The premium 5206 movement with that crisp snapping day/date change at midnight adds a bit of mechanical theatre. The dial has warmth that feels very intentional — strong brown center, subtle fade outward.
Both are LM Specials. Both early 70s.
But they wear completely differently.

The 5216 feels smooth and precise — that high-beat sweep gives it a more “refined espresso machine” vibe.

The 5206 feels rich and classic — bold coffee tone, satisfying calendar snap, slightly more vintage warmth.

Same era. Same family. Different personality.
If you had to pick one —
are you going Flatwhite Linen or Phe Sua Coffee?

I forgot to clean my coffee pot yesterday. It happens. Finished taking care of it and now I'm waiting for the coffee to finish brewing.

The cats are fed and have slipped into their routine of grooming and resting on the couch.

Most of my neighbors are still asleep and I'm enjoying my favorite part of the day when it's completely silent here.

There's one neighbor who wakes up even before I do (I wake up pretty early lol). I wonder what they do for work. I'll hear their door open, then shut, and their hurried footsteps down the stairs. I'm impressed with their discipline. Hope their day goes well.

I'm supposed to do cardio today and I really don't want to. I used to enjoy it, but not so much these days. I suppose I got bored with the whole routine of it. It stopped being fun. I'll try to convince myself to get it over with though. It's still a healthy habit to maintain.

Happy Friday out there.

No it doesn’t. You just can’t smell it anymore.

Olfactory fatigue is real. Your nose adapts to smells you’re constantly exposed to - usually within 15-30 minutes. It’s biology, not a weak fragrance.

How do I know you’re nose blind and not actually losing performance?

	∙	Ask someone else if they can still smell it (they usually can)

	∙	Walk outside for 10 minutes then come back inside (you’ll smell it again)

	∙	Smell coffee beans then sniff your wrist (it’ll come back)

Stop freebasing your fragrance trying to smell it all day.

You’re not supposed to consciously smell yourself for 8 hours straight. That would be exhausting and annoying. Your brain filters it out so you can focus on literally anything else.

Other people can still smell you. You just habituated to your own scent.

This is why people overspray and become walking scent bombs - they keep adding more because they can’t smell themselves anymore. Don’t be that person.

Exception: Some fragrances actually DO have weak longevity (looking at you, most citrus scents). But if you’re complaining that your Interlude or Layton “disappears,” it’s 100% nose blindness.

Trust the process. Stop sniffing your wrists every 5 minutes.

Anyone else had someone tell them they still smell great hours after you thought it was gone?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1770979675.0,nisbahAU,1,0.75,False
1r3m2by,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1r3m2by/the_psychology_of_reading_microsignals_how_to/,The Psychology of Reading Micro-Signals: How to Notice What 99% of People Miss,"Spent the last 2 years diving deep into social dynamics research, body language studies, and honestly just people-watching like a total weirdo at coffee shops. What I found kinda blew my mind, most of us are walking around basically blind to what's really happening in conversations.

The thing is, we're all picking up on maybe 30% of what someone's actually communicating. The rest? Flying right over our heads while we're busy thinking about what to say next or checking if we have food in our teeth. I used to think I was decent at reading people until I started studying this stuff from legit sources like Joe Navarro's work (ex-FBI guy who literally wrote the book on body language), research from Paul Ekman (the dude who mapped out microexpressions), and honestly some fascinating podcasts like Hidden Brain that break down the science of human behavior.

Here's what actually works when you want to read between the lines:

**1. Watch the feet, forget the face**

This sounds weird but feet don't lie. Someone's face might be smiling at you during a conversation but if their feet are pointed toward the door or away from you, they mentally checked out 5 minutes ago. Joe Navarro's ""What Every Body is Saying"" goes deep on this, the guy spent 25 years catching spies by watching their feet. Insanely good read if you want to understand how our lower body reveals true intentions way before our upper body does. 

When someone's genuinely interested, their entire body orients toward you, feet included. If you're talking to someone and they keep angling away, even subtly, that's your cue to wrap it up or change topics.

**2. Notice the micro stuff happening around the eyes**

Real smiles involve the whole eye area crinkling up, fake ones just move the mouth. This is called the Duchenne smile and it's basically impossible to fake convincingly. But here's the cooler part, when someone's pupils dilate slightly during conversation, they're genuinely interested in what you're saying or attracted to you. When they constrict, they're either uncomfortable or disagree with something.

Also pay attention to blink rate. Normal is like 15-20 times per minute but when someone's stressed or lying that number shoots up. During relaxed genuine conversation it actually decreases.

**3. Listen for voice pitch changes mid-sentence**

Most people focus on WHAT is said but HOW it's said reveals everything. When someone's voice suddenly goes up in pitch at the end of a sentence that should be a statement, they're actually unsure about what they just said or seeking approval. 

Conversely, when someone's voice drops lower and gets slower, they're either trying to establish dominance or they're extremely confident about their point. The podcast ""The Science of Success"" had this fascinating episode about vocal tonality and persuasion that changed how I listen to people completely.

**4. Track the timing of reactions**

Genuine emotional reactions happen FAST, like within half a second. If someone hears surprising news and their shocked expression comes after a delay, even just one full second, it's probably performed. Same with laughter, real laughs are involuntary and immediate.

This applies to agreement too. If you say something and there's a pause before someone nods or says yes, they're either unsure or don't actually agree but feel socially pressured to. True agreement is basically instant.

If you want to go even deeper on understanding social dynamics and behavioral psychology but don't have time to read through dense academic papers or multiple books, there's actually a personalized learning app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's built by AI researchers from Google and pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create audio learning tailored to exactly what you want to improve. You can type something specific like ""become better at reading body language in professional settings"" and it generates a structured learning plan with podcasts you can listen to during your commute. The depth is fully adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It includes content from books like the ones mentioned here plus tons of behavioral science research, all fact-checked and synthesized into something actually digestible.

**5. Notice pacifying behaviors under stress**

When people feel uncomfortable or threatened (even just socially), they unconsciously do little things to calm themselves down. Touching their neck, rubbing their arms, playing with jewelry, adjusting their collar. These are called ""pacifying behaviors"" and they spike during moments of stress or when someone just told a lie.

Women often touch their suprasternal notch (that little dip at the base of the throat) when anxious. Men often touch the back of their neck. Both genders will increase face-touching and self-soothing gestures when uncomfortable.

**6. Watch for blocking behaviors**

Crossed arms isn't always defensive but it IS a barrier. More subtle blocking includes someone suddenly placing an object between you and them (their phone, a cup, a menu), or if they're sitting, angling their torso slightly away while keeping their head facing you.

The book ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks this down with actual percentages and studies. It's not some pop psychology BS, they reference actual peer-reviewed research on territorial behavior and personal space dynamics.

**7. Catch the incongruence between channels**

This is probably the most powerful one. When someone's words, tone, and body language don't match up, ALWAYS trust the body language. If someone says ""I'm fine"" but their shoulders are slumped, voice is flat, and they won't make eye contact, they're obviously not fine.

Our verbal communication evolved way after our nonverbal cues, so the body is actually more honest because it's operating on older, more automatic systems. We can control our words pretty easily but controlling our entire physical presence requires conscious effort most people can't maintain.

**8. Notice baseline shifts**

This is the pro move. You can't interpret any signal without knowing someone's baseline behavior first. Some people are naturally fidgety, some maintain intense eye contact normally, some are just awkward.

Spend the first few minutes of any interaction just observing their normal patterns. THEN watch for deviations. If someone who's been animated suddenly goes still, or someone who's been reserved suddenly gets chatty, that shift means something significant just happened internally.

**9. Pay attention to proximity changes**

When someone likes you or agrees with you, they'll unconsciously lean in or decrease distance. When they're uncomfortable or disagree, they'll lean back or create more space. This happens in tiny increments, like inches, but it's consistent.

Also notice if someone mirrors your movements after a slight delay, that's a sign of rapport and connection. If they're doing the opposite of your movements (you lean in, they lean back), there's tension or disagreement happening below the surface.

**10. Watch the hands for emphasis patterns**

Liars and people who are unsure tend to keep their hands closer to their body or hidden. Confident honest people use bigger hand gestures that are open and expansive. But here's the key, watch WHEN the hands move.

If someone makes a claim and their hands gesture AFTER their words, like an afterthought, they're probably manufacturing the emotion or emphasis. When hands and words are synchronized naturally, that's genuine. This tiny timing difference is hard to fake.

Reality is, most of social interaction is happening beneath the surface level of actual words. We're constantly broadcasting our true feelings and intentions through dozens of micro-signals every minute but most people are too caught up in their own heads to notice.

The good news? Once you start paying attention to even a few of these signals, you'll immediately level up your ability to navigate social situations, avoid awkward moments, and actually connect with people on a deeper level. You'll know when to push forward in a conversation and when to back off. You'll catch lies before they spiral. You'll understand what people actually need vs what they're saying they need.

Start with just one or two signals and practice noticing them consistently. Your brain will start picking up on patterns automatically after a while, it becomes second nature. Then add more signals to your awareness gradually.

The goal isn't to become some manipulative mind reader, it's just to actually SEE what's already happening right in front of you that everyone else is missing. Game changer for literally every relationship in your life.

1r3m2ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/InvertPets/comments/1r3m2ak/hey_everyone_im_a_little_heartbroken_and_confused/,"Hey everyone, I’m a little heartbroken and confused. I just got two giant burrowing cockroaches (Macropanesthia rhinoceros) on Wednesday, and by Friday, one of them had died. The other one seems fine and is moving around normally.","Here’s my setup:



* Substrate: cocopeat + sand + mulch + gum nut leaves
* Added springtails and isopods for microfauna
* To help the springtails and isopods thrive, I mixed in **used Moka pot coffee grounds** and **used herbal tea leaves** (damp) before the roaches arrived





They were in the enclosure for about two days before one died — it was the female. The surviving one seems active and healthy.



From what I’ve read and been told:



* Coffee grounds and tea leaves probably **didn’t directly kill** the roach — caffeine levels are too low and herbal tea isn’t toxic in small amounts.
* Most likely, the death was due to **shipping stress, acclimation, dehydration, or subtle environmental changes**. Yearlings/females can be more sensitive.
* Springtails and isopods are harmless.





I’ve removed the surviving roach to a clean substrate and plan to rebuild the enclosure properly.



Has anyone else had one of two die so quickly after arrival? Did anything in my setup contribute more than I realize? I just want to make sure the survivor thrives.",2,1770979660.0,InvertPets,0,1.0,False

1r3m1bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/mysore/comments/1r3m1bf/mysuru_we_can_be_better_than_this/,"Mysuru, we can be better than this.","Just needed to vent because this honestly made my blood boil. 

I was out for coffee with a friend. She wasn’t wearing anything revealing (which shouldn’t even matter), yet multiple grown men kept staring at her in a way that was clearly uncomfortable and disrespectful. This isn’t rare. It’s a pattern. It happens almost every time.

What bothers me the most is that it’s often working professionals. Married men. “Educated” adults. Even college students. The kind of people who should absolutely know better.

We even confronted one man who was blatantly staring. He didn’t look away. No shame. No hesitation. That level of entitlement is disturbing.

And before anyone says “ignore it”, why should women have to constantly ignore, tolerate, or adjust? Why can’t basic decency be the norm?

As a man, it’s embarrassing to witness this so frequently. It genuinely makes me wonder how women are expected to feel comfortable in public spaces here when this behaviour is so normalised.

This isn’t about clothing. It’s about respect. And we seriously need to do better.

TLDR : This behaviour of men staring at women in public is very common in Mysore, across all age groups, including working professionals, married men, and even college students. It’s disrespectful, normalised, and needs to be called out. Women shouldn’t have to feel uncomfortable just existing in public spaces.",21,1770979562.0,mysore,12,0.92,False

They order a hot coffee. The coffee is warm, inviting, has a wonderful aroma. (Personally im fond of blueberry vanilla flavoring).

The hot pocket appears warm, inviting, gooey, cheesy, melty, it looks so good. But then you bite into that hot pocket and realize its ice cold on the inside. Even frozen. You burn your mouth on the outside, and are just left with disappointment from the inside. You dont even know how this can even happen. Like, how is it scalding on the outside and frozen on the inside, how does that even work?

But we have to see the truth  For one, a ham and cheese hot pocket doesn't actually mix well with coffee - you cant dunk it, and taste wise they really dont go together.

And oh, that coffee? It only goes cold when you leave it alone for too long. How many times have you seen a discarded coffee, because its not hot anymore?

But take a second look, there was someone who saw that cold coffee was beautiful, delicious, and so valuable they made it into one of the most profitable items in the world. Coffee never stopped being valuable.

Oh, and that hot pocket? Yeah, thats dollar store knockoff material now.
