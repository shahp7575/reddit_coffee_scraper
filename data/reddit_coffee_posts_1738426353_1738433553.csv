Fuck. Lmfao. Okay. So. 

I was GOING to have a very chill day here at the gym, drinking free coffee and pretending to be recovering from a workout in the lobby whilst actually just chilling on my laptop. 

But then a crying kid ran out of one of the kid's classes and bolted out of the gym. He ran really far into the parking lot past several businesses and towards a dangerous road. I helped chase him down and get him back safely to his dad. A successful reconnection. 

Damn, that was. An adrenaline spike I wasn't expecting. See? I CAN express proxy parental/elder sibling-esque care towards more than one youth without causing harm nor diminishing my devotion to my own family. 

Why is everything so deeply imbued with meaning this is all like too on-the-nose istg.   
  
Okay, so basically. Back in October, at this very gym, I walked around the track day-dreaming. 

I guess that I was day-dreaming as an escape. I'd been in a really bad state mentally and I was hoping... maybe I could plan up some changes to my life that would kill my mental anguish a bit. 

I wound up vividly dreaming up my ideal job. I even daydreamed sort of an elaborate persona that I would wish my new boss to embody. Like, I envisioned her so vividly it was as if she were a real person and I already felt so loyal to her and couldn't wait to meet her. 

I fixed up my Linkedin, to make myself maybe a little bit more traditionally marketable. Reluctantly, I changed my Linkedin name to my legal name, which is not the name I usually go by in my day to day life. 

I searched online and wound up applying for a job at a home care/hospice care compliance consulting company. The job really seemed like an ideal fit for what I'd been looking for. 

While I waited to hear back, I wound up falling back in love with my CURRENT teaching job and no longer wanted to leave. 

THEN the compliance consulting company called me up and offered me a part time remote position -- which wouldn't require me to leave my current job. 

It was all so SO perfect. I went to the onboarding and the Boss Lady was so. SO cool. It was as though I had manifested the day dream I'd envisioned.  
  
She's a champion body builder. Literally. And her conference room is decorated with her trophies!!? And she's got this tenacious, ambitious, and glamorous attitude, I can't even describe it. 

Like, you know the kind of archetype in films who's usually the boss of a fashion or marketing company? I mean, she's like that but better? Bigger? Inspirational. AND SHE'S REAL! Charismatic. Like, a demanding and commanding temperament but like...in a way that's inspiring I think. 

Ambitious. The right words are kind of alluding me but what i can tell you is that she's ...so SO cool.  Like, exactly the type of person one would feel deeply honored to work for, okay?

So, I had one Zoom meeting where they said ""We'll send the materials you need to get started on the project this week. We'll meet via Zoom to check in every Friday."" 

I really liked the whole company culture and everything and I was really really honored to be offered the position and I was excited to start. 



Amid the back drop of all of this... I had been really REALLY struggling with my mental health and OCD. 

I got it into my head that I had to cut contact with some of my long-time online friends and I wrote this ...weird...farewell letter to one of them. Which I posted as a fan fic for some reason. And then I went into a deep state of mourning as though the entire situation wasn't self-inflicted. 

It makes a lot more sense if you start from the understanding that I'm deeply mentally unstable, okay?

Anyhow. I waited to receive the project materials from the compliance consulting company. Or the zoom link to the weekly meeting. For weeks. I tried to follow up. And got no reply. I had already been hired and yet...they'd ghosted me.

\*I understand\* 

I would think. 

\*It's Karma. It's because I cut off contact with my friends. It's the price I have to pay. Because, after all, there is balance in the universe. It all hurts. But this is the way it has to be.\*

The pain of missing my friends would sometimes hit my like a rogue wave. This new  song by Blink-182 would frequently come on my favorite station: 

""♪ ♫ ♬Strangers...from strangers into brothers  
From brothers into strangers once again...♪ ♫ ♬""  


I would literally clutch my chest in pain and cry out, in my car.  
  
""♪ ♫ ♬...It shouldn't take a sickness  
Or airplanes falling out the sky...♪ ♫ ♬""

I would sob and change the station. God, what had I done...

Well, diary, as you may recall the last time I posted an entry, I was at the beginning of taking ill. As predicted, I came down with a pretty severe flu-like illness. 

I got a fever of 102 and felt like utter, utter shit. To my husband's credit, he was starting to recover from his own illness and he did a pretty good job of taking care of me. 

Then, at literally the most surreal and ironic possible moment...like...who the fuck is orchestrating these events... 

I got an email from one of my friends whose lives I had disappeared from. 

They were able to track down my work email. Do you know why? Because I had updated my Linkedin account to my legal name. 

Well. 

  
I was on the phone to my therapist the next day, keening and sobbing and trying my damnedest to untangle my thoughts. 

But the long and short of it is...

I realized I was being a fool. Why do I have this wrong notion so ingrained in my head, that the right course of action must always be the hardest one? The one that causes me the most pain?

Also, my friends never even noticed the farewell letter I'd posted.   
So from their perspective I'd just totally ghosted without explanation and they thought I'd died. 

Fucking...ouch. Oops. Holy shit. I did NOT mean to do that. Kind of ironic when trying to cause the least suffering leads to WAY MORE of it than necessary. 

But in any case, the long and short of it is: I realized I was being a fool. Perceiving Kobayashi Maru scenarios which had no basis in reality, within the hellish holodeck of my mind. 

I reconnected with my friends. 

Do you know what happened. 

THE NEXT FUCKING DAY. 

I heard back from the compliance consulting company who had ghosted me for the past month. They apologized for the long delay, sent the project materials, and expressed the hope that we could get things back on track from where we'd left off. 

Lmao, also, I shit you not, diary.

But...another day bedridden with crippling depression. Strangely, there's not much anxiety. Just very low mood. If there's one thing quitting alcohol has done and that's to ease the anxiety (although I'm now day 16 of Sertraline (Zoloft) so could be that I guess).

Breakup in November caused all this. Struggling so bad. No friends. No family. Lonely and bored. Drank heavy over Christmas and New Year to get over the breakup. But of course that made me worse.

But I'm struggling to do basic tasks. Personal hygiene gone to hell. House is a tip. Floordrobe is so bad, the cat has made a home there. Not washed the car. Dishwasher needs emptying. Not even left the house. Milk has run out. Now the coffee has run out. Drinking black tea and now the sugar is low as well. I've hardly eaten in 2 months. Made yet another hole in my belt. Lost 1½ stone (21lb if you're across the pond) and now sitting at 10st 12lbs (152lbs). But actually look good from it. But smoking quite heavily (didn't before). Money getting worryingly low.

We drifted apart after I got absolutely wrecked on booze one night (I mean proper blackout trashed) and it wasn't the same afterwards. We persevered but it finally ended in November. I've been utterly heartbroken since then. Hollow. Almost catatonic at times. Zero motivation to do anything at all.

Alcohol has wrecked every single relationship I've had. And I've been with some absolute stunners in my time (I'm a pretty decent looking bloke tbh). But I've lost them all.

Oh man this sucks so bad 😞 I fucking hate alcohol.

Sorry for lengthy, self-pitying post. I just need to know there is still a life to live 'out there' and that I'm not alone.

there’s this girl standing across from us, kinda just looking our way the whole time, so i’m like, why not include her in the convo, right? we all end up talking, and eventually, the group splits into two rooms. i end up in the other room with my friend, and she’s there too. we keep talking until around 10 pm, and then i dip because, honestly, i prioritize my sleep over everything.

next day, i’m at the gym, talking to a friend, and i mention that i’m not really dating around right now. told him the girl from the get-together was nice, seemed into me, but i was just gonna leave it at that and try to just be nice—nothing more, nothing less.

then, later that day, i see her at a bus stop. just being polite, i say hi. later, she texts me about this fair i apparently mentioned while drunk—classic, right? it’s pretty clear she wants me to go with her, but i had this weird vibe about her, so i just told her i had a job interview that day (which i did, and i got the job, so yay for that).

trying to be courteous, i text her like, ""hey, we can grab coffee if you want."" she says she’s free all week, so i suggest we go on the weekend. then she’s like, ""can’t—got a birthday to plan."" i’m like, cool, no big deal, just said, ""maybe another time then,"" and left it at that.

fast forward to this party, and my friend pulls me aside, asking why i’m being weird with \[girl’s name\]. i’m confused, so i tell him i’m not into her and didn’t feel like hanging out ‘cause of that bad vibe. he’s like, ""cool, just wondering since we talked about it.""

but now i’m stuck at this party, overthinking whether just being nice and not wanting to date someone makes me weird. honestly, it doesn’t bother me too much, but i’m curious how she got to that conclusion. like, everyone in my friend group jokes about how chill i am once we hang out a few times—i'm practically the chill guy meme at this point.

I came across a book by one of your clients, \[Author Name\], \[*Book Title*\]. It has  the same \[specific similarity\] as my YA Urban Fantasy novel, *Dead Hands*, and I thought you might be interested.

**Dead Hands** follows Coffee, a 13-year-old card-sharp, who’s learned the ways of fast living from his father, a wandering gambler. But things go south when Dad is kidnapped into the Afterlife, to play cards with the dead for the souls of the living. 

To save his father, Coffee must navigate a ghostly poker tournament. With the help of some newfound friends, he’ll square off against demon trains, sugar-skulled enforcers, and uncover the plot of an evil underworld gangster to enslave the souls of the living. To get his father back, he’ll have to bet it all, even his own soul, and learn what being a part of a family really means.

Dead Hands is a YA Urban Fantasy complete at 106,000 words. It blends high-stakes poker with myths and legends of the US/Mexico border region. It’s a coming-of-age tale that will appeal to fans of *Six of Crows* by Leigh Bardugo and *Wake of Vultures* by Lila Bowen.

As a former history teacher, curriculum designer, and educational advisor, I’ve always loved creating stories and experiences that stick. From middle school classrooms to fun adult-ed simulations, I honed my skills in crafting narratives that educate and captivate. Now I’ve pointed those talents into crafting this novel, Dead Hands.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US. I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal - cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences, so I'm more open to people from parts of the world more distinct from my own. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else. Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life. I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction. Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Been overweight a long time, but in the last 2 years I’ve hit my highest weight ever, and it was a reality check. 

Total I need to lose approx 70-75 lbs, and I’m down about 25-30 lbs so far.
(5”4, 30F, started ~200, goal is ~130)

I’ve found some things that are working for me - mainly just eating at home, and I have either soup or salad (with a protein) for dinner and I feel better in the morning (less bloated). I work a lot of hours and just used to order in a lot, which I’ve cut down almost entirely. 

I don’t feel the urge to cheat anymore, but how do you deal with social or work settings which require you to eat out? Like I know one day isn’t going to break it, and it wasn’t one day of eating out that did this to me, but I feel really apprehensive and slightly anxious about the thought of going out now because I don’t want to slip back into old habits. 

For example: 
- work lunches: I’ll try to eat healthy, but we usually go to a pub 
- social events: my friends are skinny and we are planning a trip; they’re planning short stops at fast food joints for when we’re driving back and forth 
- other social events: if I meet up with a friend, we’re at least doing coffee or lunch

I know I can’t be a hermit and just eat at home all the time, but it’s a bit of a mental struggle. Any advice? ",1,1738432696.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

I think a lot of the tension is me living at home. I’m in grad school and can’t really afford to live alone. My parents have been nice enough to let me live home for free while finishing my schooling.

But god he’s making things so hard. Started last year when he and my mother tried shipping me off to a mental hospital because I was - CRYING. That’s right. Cried loudly for a few hours because I was going through a very deep heartbreak and his solution, rather than talk to me, was to hospitalize me. He even said “either talk about it or be quiet”. Now I opted not to talk because I just wanted to be left alone to cry but saying “shut up or talk” isn’t very helpful or kind in that situation. 

Didn’t talk to him for a month and frankly do not forgive him still. 

The rest has been little stuff. He constantly accuses me of lying for money? Like he’ll forget to pay me back for picking up food for months and I’ll give him a big total (no shocks there) and his response is “you’re not trying to steal from me are you.” Like that is so incredibly hurtful. 

Beyond that he constantly ignores me. I’ll be talking to him for ten minutes and get no response only to realize he’s been playing on his phone or watching tv and wasn’t listening. 

He’s frankly incredibly gross. I’d incredibly vocal on the toilet and clearing his throat and eating etc etc. leaves coffee stains everywhere, forgets to flush, pees on the seat, doesn’t clean besides the dishes. 

I constantly hear him shouting and cursing at work, the tv, what have you which makes doing my own work borderline impossible. I can hear him through the floor, a closed door, and noise cancelling headphones. Literally the whole argument he made for me living home was that it’d be cheaper and I wouldn’t hear them w my headphones but I can.

He also constantly lords the generosity over me anytime we fight. Today we got into a bad one (I was definitely being dramatic but he decided to comment and escalate) and he said if I didn’t like it here I could leave. So I did. Left with a fuck you and haven’t been home since. Had so much I wanted to do today and now I’m eating lunch alone and incredibly down and depressed. My whole Saturday is ruined. 

I’m just really starting to resent him. He does a lot for me but he makes me feel bad otherwise. Just don’t know what to do.

I'm assuming she thought I was going to ask for her number but she looked happy when I said goodbye and never asked for it. I would have small talk with her about class every now and then for 2 weeks. She always seemed nervous but I just assumed it's because it's not everyday someone you don't know walks up to you and starts a conversation but the other day she seemed very nervous.
This day I talked to her longer, (about 30 mins ) her face started to get red and she was fidgeting a lot. Every time she talked she'd stutter nervously. I thought she wasn't into me because of that first day interaction but after seeing her body language that day I asked her to get coffee with me and she said yes. I told her I was gonna go study and she said she wanted to charge her laptop so she got up and we studied together for a couple hours. I was surprised because I usually just talk to her and leave to study somewhere else. I got her Instagram and told her what time I'd pick her up and she agreed. When it came to be that time she texted me ""heyy im so sorry im not going to be home until later today something with my mom came up but if you're up for it we can try another day?"" I said ""Ah that's okay, is your mom okay?"" And I never got a response back and it's been about 2 days since then and she’s been posting stuff on her story.

1ifbvvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1ifbvvw/my_experiences_and_observations_of_stockholm/,"My experiences and observations of Stockholm, Sweden.","In 2024, I went to Stockholm and went there towards the end of my European travels. The reality is that I was worn down after months of traveling throughout Europe during my sabbatical and I went with a close friend of mine. Here are some things I noticed in my time there that I wanted to share with all of you.

**Beautiful and safe city.**

Stockholm seemed to have two major centers which were Soldermalm and Ostermalm. I am probably typing them wrong and there could be more but it felt so beautiful and safe. Even compared to some cities like Prague and Budapest, I felt safer there. I hear the crime is more in the suburbs but in the city itself, I did not deal with any of the horror stories the internet tells you about. Maybe if I went to Malmo it be different story.

I barely saw any homeless people outside of a handful. Beautiful statues throughout the city. One of the two districts had this fancy high-end mall.

**The Airbnb situation sucks.**

I tried looking for AirBnbs and it was tough to find a good one. Apartments there are small and you don't realize it until you actually stay in one. For example, a friend of mines had a bathroom where the shower was a freaking tube and you had to close your arms off while showering or you'd hit everything. A lot also seem like the owner cannot legally do it but they do it anyways so you'd pick your keys up at a convenience store.

**Big coffee and cafe culture which I loved.**

I am a sucker for a good coffee shop and Stockholm had a lot. I went to a few myself and helped myself to things like a Nutella Croissant. It made daytime quite enjoyable in the city. The coffee itself was alright too but views of the clean streets? I loved it, foreign to me as an American.

**The retail staff are nice and happy.**

Whether at a cafe or bar or restaurant, the staff were usually nice. Lack of people who seemed grumpy and unhappy. Everyone seemed to like to do their job. Once again a foreign concept for me as an American. Here you get a ton of grumpy retail workers lol.

**Yes, the women are beautiful, even the ones working retail.**

Probably some of the hottest in Europe. Even if you don't like blondes, women of other races in Sweden are hot. I am not sure how they do it in Sweden. The Black and Arab women in Stockholm were just gorgeous. Its Stockholm, of course it has hot women!

However, go to a McDonald there or a Starbucks to see a supermodel working there. Unreal....

**But also somewhat weird.....**

Maybe not the Black and Arab ones but the White ones..

Like maybe playful supervillain weird. I do want to do a separate post asking Euro guys about this but women from Germany, Scandinavia, and Northern Europe have this strange vibe. Like get under your skin, try to scare you, and then laugh when they do. I actually hooked up with a chick that consistently talked about how she could eat me and how I would probably taste like if she did........I had to try to get out of that bed but be polite about it and she would not let me. I did eventually get out but that was one psychotic experience.

It's like their version of fun is...strange. Like you can go from cool hookup to realizing you hooked up with a psycho that wants to play psycho games with you and take pleasure in doing so. I am not sure how else to put this into words......

**Minorities can do well but they better be state of the art.**

The idea goes that darker skinned guys are like in Scandinavia. At least in Sweden, I think that is half true. You better look great and have top tier game to get women there. If not, you are going to lonely and struggling. Your average guy of any race is going to have a tough time in Sweden, at least in Stockholm. I did see interracial couples but in all of them, the guy was well dressed and handsome.

**Weather there is funky.**

I went to Stockholm during what I consider a really early fall and it was freezing. You'd also look up at 3 AM and it would be sunlight or at least daytime. It was the weirdest weather I had ever seen. However, it was beautiful.

**Unfortunately, way too many New Yorkers.**

I am going to offend a lot of people with this but I do not care. Stockholm had too many New Yorkers and that is a bad sign. Amongst my fellow Americans, I found New Yorkers to be by far the most insufferable tourists. The guys go around looking for fights left and right. The women are ultra-feminist prudes that act spiteful and miserable, even going out of their way to cockblock random guys and label them as ""toxic masculine"" pigs. It's almost hilarious how awful New Yorkers abroad are.

**The Scandinavian way, nice to your face but you never know where you stand with people.**

When I talked to women in Stockholm, I realized that rejections were different. In America and even most of Europe, they tell you to fuck off. In Scandinavia, they will smile at your face and then when you are gone, reject you. Like you may ask a girl for her IG and think it went well, she will even give it to you and follow you back, but then hours later, you are blocked by her. 

My friend and I noticed this. The culture is not argumentative or confrontational in your face like American culture is. It is why I think New Yorkers are so out of place in Sweden. 

**Nightlife is heavy on nightclubs, come early or wait outside forever.**

Try to get into the clubs at around 10 PM or wait outside forever. The streets were just full of people as a result of this. As for the nightclubs, there is a big culture of that in Sweden. I went to a few due to coming early. Music is usually typical American music.

I've kind of exhausted my google searches so I decided to hop on here and see maybe if some of the brilliant minds here can help. I have an old ish pc. 

The specs are as follows:

  
CPU: Intel i7 9700k

GPU: Asus ROG Strix 2070 super

RAM: 32gb Gskill Trident Z 3600mhz

Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix Z390-F

  
The cpu is liquid cooled with an AIO.

Now on to my issue.

When I'm streaming or playing a few newer games I sometimes get crackling sounds and my cpu hits 100%.

I've formatted, updated drivers and I've even turned down graphics in games but still my pc is struggling and I genuinely feel like it shouldn't. I've tried the AI overclocked in the bios and that bluescreens my pc.

  
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I am planning on upgrading the CPU and such but that's going to be a while so if I can fix this somehow it would be awesome.

1ifbqex,https://www.reddit.com/r/saukstasproto/comments/1ifbqex/something_about_these_food_insecurity_studies/,Something about these food insecurity studies worries me,"https://reddit.com/link/1ifbqex/video/5t5y5ejtsdge1/player



Something about these food insecurity studies worries me. Feelings of insecurity related to food are associated with poorer psychological well-being. Okay, but a low sense of security is not an independent feeling; it is also associated with more environmental factors – often with a lack of money and sometimes with a lack of food, which might be real or changed by perception errors. All the other factors in the same environment can impact the poor psychological state – after all, if there is a lack of money for food, what other shortages come along? And if there is a lack of food, then there are probably other problems at the same time. After all, you can’t directly link food insecurity feeling and a psychological state – most likely, the environment in which one experiences food insecurity damages the psychological state.



Question number two. Does food security induce a good psychological state even if it were a consciously perceived state (something like “Oh, we will never run out of food”)? Can we attribute such honour to this factor if it “works” only in one direction? Or is it just that a pantry full of grains, cabbage, cookies, coffee, and apples is a source of happiness by itself, and this effect is real?



Do you think that when you think about the abundance of food, you feel a sense of comfort or some other positive feeling that would improve your psychological state? Is it still essential to know that we will have something to eat?

1ifbp9i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifbp9i,Curious on Increasing Flow and Declining Pressure during espresso pull,"Hey all!

This question is regarding something James Hoffman said in a video that if your flow increases too much during a shot, it could be a sign that something went wrong.

This caused me to get the app for my Acaia Pearl and measure this so I could investigate.

This is what my shots are looking like.

For more context:
- 21g dose, 20g IMS Basket 
- Wet paper filter on the bottom
- Puck screen
- Freshly roasted, rested 2 weeks
- Ground of df54
- Blind shaker, surface level WDT

Machine:
Ascaso Steel UNO PID
92 °C
5-second full pressure pre-infusion 
5-second bloom


 I’ll note that since this is the UNO, I’ve considered playing around with declining pressure by declining flow by opening the steam valve. Would love thoughts on that.

I’ll also note that the Ascaso measures back pressure at the group, and it does decline quite a bit down to 5 bars towards the end of the shot. It can hit like 10 bars or 11 the drops down.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

1ifbk5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1ifbk5r/f4f_lets_create_together_an_urban_fantasy_epic/,[F4F] Let's create together an urban fantasy epic! [Discord][Adv.lit.],"Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

Maybe just coincidence but after I discovered espresso in Italy in 2019 and ended up getting a Gaggia and then upgrading to a Lelit, obviously there was no filtering happening with those either. So after seeing those studies mentioned and reading a mention here about the paper filters, I ordered some and will never be without them again.

I use one size for the bottom of my 18g basket, and then another for the top (which functions the same as a puck screen but is way less hassle). I think they're a bargain considering how they enhance my workflow and eliminate cholesterol potential impact of my espresso addiction. So a huge thanks to the person who posted a while back about Good Brothers and their filters!

I like my LOs to be as “drop and play” as possible. Tweaking with holotapes and settings is my bane. That said, there’s still some tweaks to do for this LO. I toss these all into a container after initial set up and forget about them. 

CRAFT - These will need to be crafted at a Chem Station

True storms Configuration - Turn Effects ON, Set [Ghoul Horde Chance] to 10%

True Storms Weather Control - lets you control the weather. I don’t mess with it

HUD HoloTime - can be used to adjust position/sizing. I don’t mess with it 

Lone Wanderer Motorcycle - You can craft this when you find the Motorcycle bench(not too far from Sanctuary) I turn down the Activation Sounds to about 20% and turn off the Survival Mode penalty for the sleeping bag and turn on save when used for traveling

AUTO - These should be automatically in your inventory when you start a new game.

NPCs Travel - Set [Number of NPC] Presets to MIN and do the same for [DLC] Presets, Set [Relations with Player] to Allies, Set [Large Group] to 10%, and finally [Holotape Settings] to change the Name of the Holotape to [Settings] prefix 

Survival Options - I turn Thirst from Items OFF and give myself the Save Item

Plenty o Exploration - Default good, no need to open

Munitions - Default good, no need to open

Did you know that short-term rental properties that embrace local culture receive 20% higher ratings on average? Local culture plays a pivotal role in defining guest experiences and the overall success of vacation rental businesses. For hosts using platforms like Llivo, understanding and incorporating the traditions, customs, and attractions of their locale can set them apart in a competitive market. This blog explores how [local culture](https://www.llivo.com/) can make or break your vacation rental business and provides actionable strategies to ensure success.

https://preview.redd.it/7t91p7libkge1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=45fbae7be0891a03600e09bb5565bd72dccc2909

# The Problem: Ignoring Local Culture Can Lead to Failure

# Why Hosts Struggle Without Cultural Integration

Many hosts underestimate the importance of local culture, leading to missed opportunities for enhancing guest satisfaction. Common pitfalls include:

* Providing generic accommodations that lack a sense of place.
* Failing to highlight local attractions or traditions.
* Ignoring cultural nuances that could make guests feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.

These oversights can result in poor reviews, lower booking rates, and ultimately, a struggling business. Guests often seek unique experiences that immerse them in the local community, and neglecting this demand can hurt your property’s appeal.

# The Solution: Integrating Local Culture into Your Vacation Rental

# 1. Showcase Local Traditions and Customs

* *Decor and Design*: Incorporate local art, crafts, or decor elements that reflect the region’s identity.
* *Cultural Welcome Packages*: Greet guests with a basket of local snacks, drinks, or souvenirs.

# 2. Highlight Nearby Attractions

* Provide a curated guidebook featuring popular and off-the-beaten-path attractions.
* Collaborate with local businesses to offer exclusive guest discounts for tours, restaurants, or activities.

# 3. Respect and Celebrate Local Practices

* Share tips on cultural etiquette to help guests navigate their stay respectfully.
* Embrace local festivals or holidays by decorating your space or sharing event schedules with guests.

# A Case Study: Success Through Cultural Integration

Consider the story of a Llivo host in New Orleans who transformed their rental business by embracing the city’s vibrant culture. By decorating their property with Mardi Gras-inspired art, offering beignets and coffee as part of the welcome package, and providing a guide to local jazz clubs, they turned their space into a sought-after destination. As a result, their bookings increased by 35%, and they consistently received 5-star reviews praising the “authentic New Orleans experience.”

Conversely, a host in the same city who ignored the cultural richness of the area struggled to maintain bookings and received complaints about the lack of personality in their property.

# Why Llivo Supports Cultural Integration

Llivo stands out among vacation rental platforms for its emphasis on building human connections and promoting authentic experiences. By prioritizing local culture, Llivo helps hosts:

* Create unique and memorable stays.
* Build trust and relationships with guests.
* Enhance their property’s value and appeal.

# Conclusion

Integrating local culture into your vacation rental strategy is essential for creating exceptional guest experiences and achieving long-term success. From highlighting traditions and attractions to collaborating with local businesses, cultural integration is a powerful tool for hosts looking to stand out. With Llivo’s support, you can elevate your property’s appeal and build lasting connections with travelers. Ready to create a culturally rich experience for your guests?

About Me:

I’m someone who finds joy in the little things—whether it’s a deep conversation over coffee, the thrill of learning something new, or simply watching the sunset after a long day. By profession, I’m a Software Engineer, but beyond that, I’m an artist at heart. Painting, digital art, and gardening are my creative escapes, and I even enjoy cooking occasionally (though I won’t claim to be a pro chef just yet!).

I have a lighthearted sense of humor that keeps things fun, and I appreciate meaningful connections built on understanding, support, and shared experiences. Life is an adventure, and I believe in making the most of it—whether it’s through exploring new places, trying different cuisines, or just enjoying a quiet moment in good company.

What I’m Looking For:

I value ambition, kindness, and a positive outlook on life. I’m looking for a partner who is supportive, career-driven, and a little adventurous—someone who enjoys good conversations, new experiences, and can appreciate both the grand adventures and the simple joys of life.

Not sure if this is the perfect place to find a life partner, but I believe great connections can happen anywhere. Let’s see where this journey takes us!",1,1738430637.0,PakistanRishta,1,1.0,False

So me (m24) and this guy (m24) have been on and off dating since August. We found each other two weeks before I was slated to move to a different state/city.

After a gig came up back home, we’ve been hanging out every week for a month. He is THE SHIT. Like—I need you to understand how great this guy is—he’s hot, incredibly smart, very sweet and extremely motivated.

I can’t overstate how relaxed and just…me I feel around him. It’s insane. The feeling of unreality personified and my god it is so sweet.

This morning we were having coffee in bed and he had clicked a hinge notification by accident. I made a smart ass comment about  it. Whatever. But then I had this unshakeable feeling that some twink or the other could swoon him in a way where he would become irretrievable to me. I felt a rawness with the extremity of a 5 year old just scraping their knee.

I checked in with myself and within a split second asked him to be my boyfriend. He said yes, but now I have this fear that it was too soon. That I put him on the spot a bit—especially considering I’d be his first relationship.

The amenities are better at Modera with a location that's better for our basic needs. Cook St is better for location for our non-basic needs like coffee and cafes. Neither get me excited about price point -- even if we can afford it -- given the current political climate.

However, the prices points are pretty average for an apt with any form of AC.

To be clear, we have 2 portable AC units (the kind with the hose) so I'm asking about some version of pre-installed AC in apts. I know when the air quality is subpar that portable versus ""installed"" AC help differently.

From the sky, a cow-skull figure watched its new host clutch its old one and took flight. The combatants crashed upwards, the trial fraying behind them, until they flew above the peak of Parapollah. But Angelino did not reach these heights to become the City’s King–his was a different goal.

“...Do you know why I've taken on these parasites of yours? …It was my pursuit of 'understanding' you, on a deeper and more visceral level than anything else. So I may learn how to love you as well. City. Monster. Parasite? Whatever."" Breaking his granola bar, he tossed some to the Wheelz that stowed away. ""I've had my fill of love. There is more than enough for me to pour out for a lifetime. But you—

*""—Have you learned how to love-?""*

But as Angelino swooped down to give Muuru a *safe* fall…he heard a laugh.

“Ma~ybe. But you? You’ve still got a **lot** to learn.” The boy squirmed in the grapple, his giggling growing sharp. 

“Muuru-?” Angelino began- before Muuru chomped down on his arm. “Wh- hey!”

It was enough. The grip loosened, and Muuru wriggled free, still falling up. 

Brows furrowed, Angelino reached towards him. “...Muuru, I-” Only for his hand to be punched away! Wincing, the dragon tried again, knowing they were reaching the horizon. “Muuru, listen, I didn’t m-” This time, a sharp kick sent him flying back. 

**”If you wanna be merciful, then prove you’re strong!”**

With growl of frustration and a desperate flap, Angelino darted towards him–

> *As ｢13th Floor｣ interrupted. ""Caer.""*

-and they were falling. Barely, Angelino caught him, but Muuru only grinned, legs wrapped tight around his gauntlet as he launched a haymaker at Ange’s head. Reflexively, Angelino darted back. Muuru pressed forwards. A punch to the stomach feinted into a throat chop. With one free arm, Angelino barely blocked, only for Muuru to smash him with a headbutt. 

His wings faltered. The earth rushed up from below. Head reeling, Angelino flung his arm back—only to feel his gauntlet yanked free. Muuru *refused to back down.* 

Donning the gauntlet, Muuru beckoned the dragon with a curl of his fingers. Angelino watched as his soul flared, the veil of parasites lifting to reveal the spirit of the Host,

***｢André 3000｣.***

The dragon knew *this* was the path to understanding. His spirit burned in turn, and unafraid, he wore the scales of a monster. They shimmered across his form, wings spread wide, tail lashing, eyes bright. He arced towards Muuru–and tagged him with an open palm. He would not tear the boy’s throat, he would leave no scars. His was the art of the *Caballero,* his was a Gentle Soul.

Muuru saw this and delighted. He met Angelino’s blow with his own, a pounce, a playful swipe. They were two young kaijus, petalled pelts rippling, wrestling together.  

As they swung and kicked and bit, Angelino learned a truth deeper than words. It boiled through each vein and muscle. With every strike, Angelino felt himself lose ground, plummeting towards the earth, and yet, it did not hurt. This was *his* style, and yet Muuru had pushed it further, as he vaulted off Wheelz and danced along the wind. 

When Muuru laughed, Angelino couldn’t help but laugh along. He saw it now, the tapestry woven with each blow. His mind was aflame–with the steam beneath his scales and the gale of mountain air, he could channel the currents–there! With a rush, his next punch *slammed* forwards. Muuru barely pivoted, Wheelz whirring along the gauntlet as he countered with a jab. Angelino swerved along the current, raising his leg to block- 

A resounding *CLANG* rang out about the city. The dragonfire in their blood compelled them on. Another swipe, another block, keep going, *keep going-*

“Wanna know what it’s called?”

In that moment, Angelino knew Muuru Saviragowda–because *he* was the City, too.

***”Sāvira.”***

A final punch rang out–then they fell, cometlike, into the earth.

---

The scent of lavender and aloe lifted Angelino back to consciousness. The scent and the distinct sound of chewing. His eyes flitting open, he found the crater he had made flooded with flowers. Then, looking in front of him, he found Muuru gnawing on his own arm. The boy spotted him in turn, mumbled something incoherent, and then spat his arm out.

“Morn~in. Do you get it now?”

Above their heads, the sky promised infinity.

Angelino nodded. “Yeah, I do.”

The City smiled at that, stepping forward. 

“Good-” his words cut off, choked beneath the binding ‘round his throat. The last, true parasite, a spiteful thing, leaching his soul and cursing his success. He was to die like a worm, writhing in wastewater. He had achieved nothing. He *would* achieve nothing. He was *small.* All of them, ***living only to be crushed-***

But Muuru needed no more words. In silence, he slipped something from his pocket, freeing it from its vacuum seal. A single Milano cookie,from his first meeting with the Metropolis Suite. It was warm, then. He’d wondered if it might be love.

But now, that warmth was his. Light as steam, it flowed within him, and the dragon, and everything that lived. A geothermal blessing from the Earth to its creations.

Muuru extended the treat to Angelino, and the man knew what it meant. Love, not to be sealed, but to be shared.

A faint snap resounded as it pulled apart. Angelino felt the binding wrap around his throat, but he kept on breathing.

Muuru turned, knowing they had landed at the Evergreen. Gingerly, he extended the offering towards it. The মাধৱী লতা bowed its florets shyly as a foal, eating from his palm.

There was a ripple, a river spilling from its boundaries at the edge of a monsoon. Love without borders. Muuru needed no words, but his soul sang to the parasite, 

*”You shouldn’t have cursed me. I eat poison and turn it into art~”*

to the flowers,

“”And you can too. So go create, destroy, create. That’s how we get things done!””

and to the city,

what else could he say except,

*”I love you!”*

…

*Marks spread like pressed flowers across Rākin, so that the artist could see it from his dorm room, and the deposed ruler from her cell.*

*It was a promise of a future, planted like a seed in soil. To be nurtured as the people nurtured one another.*

*It was a hope that one day, flourishing with passion, the world would be a Garden of Vermillion.*

**Scenario: New Central Supermarket Parking Lot, Yarusha City — 12:17 PM**

The hum of a motorcycle engine slowly trailed off as its rider stepped off, and a helmet soon rested atop the keyhole.

Jag Denshi looked around the parking lot before pulling out their phone, and checking the time. They were ‘on time’, as much as anyone could be, and yet-

Jag spotted Alex and Luna walking out of the grocery store, carrying some grocery bags. Luna’s eyes and ears were focused on Alex, who stared back at Luna’s winning smile. They were talking about something, but that was far from where Jag had parked.

As they moved closer together, Jag found that their conversation wasn’t the most noteworthy—it was mostly dinner plans, recent movies, how Moony was doing—it was something anyone eavesdropping would readily dismiss. 

A quick handwave from the rider caught the girls’ attention. “Yo! Did you find anything?”

Luna nodded, and shot one finger up into the air, nearly taking a plastic shopping bag with it, “Yup! The local construction workers stop here for lunch!”

Alex nodded along. “Turns out, they like the sandwiches.”

Another finger stood up on Luna’s hand. “They’re not allowed to talk about the project that they’re working on!”

Alex rolled her eyes. “And yet their bosses let them say **that.”**

A third finger rose next to its cohorts. “They don’t really care who’s paying them, just that they’re getting paid.” And, with four fingers standing tall, Luna only had a thumb to hold her grocery bag. “Some of them think that they’re building on protected land, which sounds familiar.”

Jag nodded along to their little routine. “All too familiar.” Jag put a thumb over their shoulder, aiming at their parked bike. “I’ve got a few receipts, notes, and permits we can submit to the city. It’s been a long day already.”

“I can help with that.” Calabasas’s voice reached them before the hero did. “I’ve been talking around town. Aarna’s been hearing drilling equipment echoing through the woods behind her house late at night, and Jaswinder has seen hauling trucks moving through the area.”

An almost excited look crossed Jag’s face. “Nice, good work all around everyone!” Jag pointed over in Cal’s direction. “Do you have their addresses, or numbers I can contact them at?”

“Yes,” Cal pulled a notecard out of their puffer vest. “Wrote them down.”

Jag stopped themself from taking the note card. They stuck a finger up, “Should we all head over there together? It’ll make for an easier investigation.”

The Riders nodded, eliciting a smile from Jag. As the Rider of the rural region, they knew how much work remained to be done, but if the Moonbeam Riders could bring their expertise and listen to the Floodplains, maybe they would be able to improve them as the team they had always been.

**Scenario: A vast, grassy field, Sapatibhatt — 12:17 PM**

It was a cold day in the Sapatibhatt, as evidenced by the dull green plains and the radiant sun barely peeking from behind a cloudy sky. Even still, there were signs of life, the errant hare running across the field, a pair of moths fluttering close to the ground. A quiet, yet clear heartbeat throughout the rural region. 

A crisp rustle threatened the tranquility, as a looming beast crept out from the tall grass. His eyes followed the passing moths, taking in every inch of detail, their blackened wings with gold trims catching his fancy. Titan Patel licked his chops as his legs loosened, preparing for the right moment to-

The house cat leapt from his perch, pouncing on the pair, making a few shrill *myaaaars* as he fought to catch his prey. In the end, one flew off, leaving the other to flutter hopelessly in the kitty’s mouth. He moved his paw, claws ready to take out his prize when a loud shout caused the little hunter to freeze.

“TITAN! Nooooo!” A little boy scrambled after him, running with a reckless stride. It was a miracle he didn’t trip on his own feet. Din reached the cat, heaving and huffing for just a moment, before shooting him a frown.

“We’re supposed to catch bugs, not eat them!” Din said, crossing his arms. He opened a full hand, palm-side up, grabbing the air as he gestured towards Titan. 

However, before either party could make a lunge towards the other, a hand to the shoulder stopped Din in his tracks. Disappointed, he looked up to the adult man holding him back. “Inaaaagoo. Tell Titan he can’t eat that moth,”

The man in the checkered shirt sighed, “Titan, drop it. That could be poisonous for all you know.”

For a moment, Titan glared at his fellow Rider, before dropping the poor moth from his jaws, giving it an opportunity to fly away. Din raised a brow, “Actually, that was a… an~theraea- uh~ muga silk moth! My sister works with them all the time. They’re not that dangerous!”

Titan ears perked at the notion, his eyes darting around for his lost prey, much to Inago’s bemusement. “And there he goes.” 

Din shrugged as he took a wide look out at the environment. “What kind of bugs are we looking for anyway? I can’t see any!” He dropped to all fours, pressing his face close to the ground.

“Well, they’re not going to be walking around, not during the cold season, anyway. Try looking under rocks or loose leaves. Maybe we’ll find a scolopendra hardwickei or even a gonibregmatid! Centipedes prefer moist spots, so you might have a better chance at finding some at your current level.”

Din gave the Rider a wide grin as he began to scour the grass for rocks, getting mud and loose pebbles stuck on his presumably recently-cleaned clothes in the process. Inago shook his head as he took in the scenery himself. A slight breeze jostled his messy hair under the fedora, instilling a serenity within. It was a quiet day. Inago didn’t have too many of those. Not recently anyways. He found himself engrossed in the chaos of the city, taking on its myriad of problems, from corrupt syndicates to labor disputes. If you’re not careful, you can lose yourself in the weeds. Inago nearly did.

As he reflected on the past year, his eye darted to his side. An insect fluttered past his face, its brilliant, purple wings catching his attention. He held out a finger, allowing it to land. A dragonfly, rhyothemis triangularis. Inago smiled. 

The city was full of problems. Instead, he’d make sure to focus on helping out in smaller, more local ways. He glanced over to the young boy, giggling with glee as he uncovered a nest of slimy bugs underneath a fairly hefty rock. Every small deed adds up to that perfect future.

Din returned to the Rider with a gleam in his eye, practically jumping up and down as he held out his hands to show off the bugs he found. Inago snapped out of his trance, letting the dragonfly go on its way.

“Hm, whatcha got there?” Inago said, rubbing his chin and didactically pointing at each bug in turn. “Oho, we’ve got some very interesting looking ones. Let’s see. There’s a brentidae. That one… That one is definitely an acrididae. And that one is…”

**Scenario: Old City — 12:25 PM**

“Those houses have been here a long time,” Disco D. Lune spoke, pointing out a group of buildings across the road to Soichi as they walked the streets of the city. “Though not the oldest in the city. That would probably be the current town hall, maybe some of the richer estates as well: Late 15th Century, if I recall—back when Assam at large was separate from India and known as the Ahom Kingdom, although other kingdoms were competing for the same space. In contrast, these houses are some of the earliest houses built in Rākin of the Assam-type architecture, a style developed by the British after they took over in the early 19th century.”

Soichi took a look, nodding as he took in the new information. “I see…so, they introduced a new type of architecture to extend their influence in the region?”

“It’s likely,” Disco agreed. “Though another reason may have been to account for the climate and geography of the region—take a look at the roofs, for example. They were designed with high gables in order to overcome the heavy rain common in this region, while the high ceilings and ventilation were to help with hot weather. While these L and C shaped buildings were the type they built on flatter lands, they had a separate design for the more sloped areas so as to better make use of the environment…we might be able to spot some nearer the outskirts of the old city.”

“Oh, so they were essentially working with nature as opposed to building in spite of it?” Soichi mused. “Like what I ended up doing with that spa…”

The architect shook her head, turning around to look at her conversation partner as they paused. “I’d have said it is working around nature instead of working against it,” she continued. “For me, working with nature would be incorporating it in some way, preferably in a manner that has function as well as aesthetic. I was hoping I’d get to design something with that upcoming architect Mahimit—it’s a shame they’ve taken a step back.”

“Given the kind of person their father was, I don’t blame them.” Soichi looked around before giving Disco a look filled with curiosity. “Speaking of, how was your…rest, that you took after tailing him around that military base?”

At that, Disco rolled her eyes and sighed. “Like any other person’s rest. Why ask?”

“Well, given how many days you were asleep I figured—”

“Whatever you figured it was, Soichi, I don’t want to know.”

**Scenario: The Evergreen, Palace Park, Old City — 8:12 AM**

The large tree sitting Palace Park had always been a peaceful place, if not always quiet: even ignoring the kids who would decide to run and play nearby, or the couples who thought the shade would be a nice place to stay, it was commonly a meetup between a group of friends who promised to help the city grow.

As the morning sun rose up into the skyline, however, under this tree was a hushed conversation of schemes…and mischief.

“Hmm…” Ouroboros pondered to himself, pacing across the grass. “What if I…? No, no. that wouldn’t work.” He mused, talking mainly to himself. Honeydew, his beleaguered cohort, sat quietly near him as he paced back and forth, idly scrolling on her phone and sipping from a now-room temperature cup of coffee. 

“I could hold a gala! ‘The Sing Now! Memorial Gala’! That’s brilliant—oh, think of who we could lure out! The prizes we could find!” He said, excitedly rambling to Honeydew. She merely gave a half-hearted grunt of affirmation. She didn’t care much for his schemes, but she had been more or less ordered to stick by his side.

Ouro and Honeydew both were considered Evergreen’s “wild cards” by their fellows. They were destructive, self-centered, violent. Not quite seen as *evil,* but still too dangerous to leave to their own devices. For as prone to barreling into trouble they were, it was decided perhaps the best way to keep them with as little blood on their hands as possible was to keep their energy directed towards constructive ends. Soichi smooth-talked Ouroboros into trying to track down any remaining Suite members still struggling to latch onto power, and Gioia would put Honeydew up to “keep an eye on” Ouro’s schemes. 

It was a very graceful dynamic, they ended up having. Both of them felt like the other was their lackey, in turn keeping the other in check. It wouldn’t last forever- Ouro would run out of Suite to search out, and Honeydew would get bored and find new antics to get into… But for now, they fit together like puzzle pieces forced to lock into place.

As Ouro rambled, Honeydew pressed a red heart button on her social media app of choice. It was an announcement of an international tour for the one and only Gioia Arancini sometime next year. A smile twitched into existence, disappearing just as fast as it came into being. Maybe she should tag along…

> 3rd Place: [Vasant Bulsara](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/15xoqn6/comment/jx7fo7e/) - After [losing to a penguin in a battle in a Stand Realm](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/18azylv/), he returned to end up saving a Rider from his berserk form—later [cleansing a parasite out of its host](https://old.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ehvw8r/).

**Scenario: Old City — 5:22 PM**

Gioia had just finished the final, earthy sip of her coffee as she heard the motorcycle rolling up beside her. With a sigh of satisfaction, she placed the mug down and turned to Vasant with a smile, “Your timing is impeccable, though that’s no surprise.”

Vasant simply nodded in return, leaning against the Silver Dollar as he brought it to a standstill. His expression remained as serene as it had ever been. 

“I hope you’ve been keeping well,” continued Gioia, kicking up off of the chair. “Did you wrap up your work in the South?” 

“No,” Vasant responded, looking up to the mountain. “It’s not the sort of thing to be ‘wrapped up’. But farmers who were once strangers have been speaking with each other. Their exploitation is a shared burden, so their solution must be shared too. I have faith.”

“Sometimes that’s all you need,” Gioia laughed. “I had a *particularly* eventful final meeting with the actor’s union–I’m sure if some fascist filmographer tries their luck again, *they’ll* be able to put him in the ground.” She paused, tracing his gaze upwards, before cracking a smirk. *”Especially* if Muuru starts that acting career.”

She had known from the moment that they broke that cookie–her friend had marked a potential path towards the future. 

“You told your friend about the concerns from the Sherpa communities?”

“About the Estates? Minali said the Council was already meeting about that. You’re not the only one who’s been reaching out.”

Vasant breathed a sigh, finally moving to his motorcycle. “Good.”

The path forwards was dark and obscure, they both knew this well. But it would be lit by many efforts. It was no surprise that Rākin would remain in good hands, but it *was* a relief.

“Are you ready?” Vasant asked, gesturing towards the Silver Dollar.

“As I’ll ever be,” with a graceful motion, Gioia vaulted over the seat to sit down. Vasant moved to sit in front, resting comfortably against the bike as he had so many times before. Gioia hummed, slinging her arms around his waist.

“We’ll meet back here soon, yes?” the smile was clear in her voice.

With a rev of the engine, Vasant bowed his head. “Of course.”

Then they were off. Around them both, the streets blurred past, shape melting into colour and symbol and suggestion. They found a new perspective on familiar roads, as the world became a vast and flowing river, carrying them to the horizon.

> 1st Place: [Muuru ""Lil' Drè"" Saviragowda](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/15xoqn6/comment/jxawbvf/) - After getting a cookie from a kind old grandma, Muuru would find himself [racing a Penguin to escape a sandworm](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1bi6aha/) before starting to take action against the Suite plaguing his City. Breaking into one of their warehouses, helping fight against the Middleman—taking a break to save a House—and eventually [discovering Shalin’s identity as the leader of the Suite and defeating her](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1fvnjxo/) with a new parasite in tow. He would then continue to show love to those in The City, [racing and playing to advertise the market](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1gwvmls/), [battling the Midnight Crew who threatened the city](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIceEd4H1xPCQ-CKWD1gi_hQ8tJ89OVxnA7978cMFp8/), fighting against his friend in a friendly sparring match, and [saving both a Monster and a House](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ht2c2d/). And now, he spars against the pinnacle of the remaining group of this city, taking lessons from all those before to use to cultivate the next generation…

**Scenario: Mili’s Diner, Mist City — 7:07 PM**

This may have been the most difficult fight of Deacon’s career. He narrowly dodged the cackling blur speeding by him, only to barely block a toppling stack of crates. Yet his opponent didn’t falter, angler mask gnashing as they turned around to lunge once more.

But this time, Deacon was prepared. He had kept himself on the backfoot the entire time, given no quarter as ｢You May Die｣ dragged traps into his opponent’s wake. Yet with each blow he took, his Stand stored more force within, its lights aglow.

Once more, his enemy scrambled atop a streetlight and vaulted at him–only for Deacon to yell out *”NOW!”* 

With that word, a wall of force slammed forth and with it, a year’s worth of frustration. It was an assertion that despite it all, *he was still here.* The blast sent his opponent rolling across the parking lot and coming to a dizzied stop. Head shaking, hands pulling off ｢You May Die｣...Braganza revealed her wild grin.

The mask smiled in turn, lure bobbing. “WELL YOU’RE NO ROCKY BALBOA, KID–BUT KEEP IT UP AND MAYBE YOU’LL BE CREED IV!”

“But you won’t have the crown for long!” Braganza swore, leaping to her feet. “Can I get a rematch!?” She looked up to the throne of cars above the ring, towards the ringleader. 

Muuru looked back at her and laughed. “Hmm~? Maaaybe!.” He looked back over the gathered crowd, larger than it had ever been, and then beyond. “After all, our star guest hasn’t-”

His words melted into a smile. *”There~ he~ is~!”*

Angelino could barely take two steps towards the ring before being assailed by his fans. Moony slung her arms around him, the assembled Riders cheered his name, even Kid gave him a nod. But as Muuru banged the car and told them all to settle, the crowd parted.

“Made it just~ on time!” 

“I wouldn’t miss it,” Angelino nodded, entering the ring. 

“Ex~cellent! Well, without further ado, we’ve got a special show…the public debut of Sāvira! A martial art that could ooonly be grown from the soil of Rākinnagarh!” With a spinning corkscrew, Muuru alighted on the ground. “You’ll be the first to see it in action~ but you won’t be the last!”

Angelino chuckled and gestured to the crowd–Muuru’s showmanship was infectious. “Please, if you can stay after the match, we’d love to teach you.”

As City and Dragon looked to each other, their auras flared. Muuru extended his gauntlet, the steam cooled into a shell of bronze and the blinking eye of a Wheelz, yet more Wheelz chanting around him. Angelino looked back to the motor throne to see ｢13th Floor｣ watching, intrigued.

There was nothing more to say, except…

“Open the Game!”

Texas Aco grinned as she watched the proceedings. It was a little ironic —at the end of all this mindless violence and agony was, well, more mindless violence. She couldn’t say she minded, though. Watching the people who had pushed themselves through so much for the sake of her city spar like this, as if they were merely playing with each other... It filled her with a warmth she never expected to find.

She sighed, turning on her heel. Entertaining as this was, she *did* also come here because she was hungry. Pushing through the doors of Mili’s Diner, she was met with a bustling crowd, all likely here because of the spectacle going on outside. Mili herself looked positively pleased as punch, soaking in the good business like a sponge. Texas moved through the crowd, making her way towards a discrete booth towards the back of the room, and having a seat. The older woman in the seat across from her perked up, placing the yarn she was busy working into a scarf on the table.

“It’s good to see you, Miss Aco.” The Gossip smiled fondly, clasping her hands together. Texas responded with her own wry grin, resting a massive chitinous limb on the table. She’d been a lot less shy about showing it off lately—one of the local heroes having an *actual tail* sure helped with that.

“Didn’t expect you to be out and about.” Texas chuckled. “Aren’t you info brokers supposed to be a little more discrete?”

“Oh, well, you know.” The Gossip chuckled as well, reclining in her seat. “An old lady ought to get out every now and then. You stay cooped up in business for too long, and, well...” She shrugged. “I’ve truly taken that to heart, after, ahem... *Recent events.”*

“Keh.” Texas smirked. “No kidding. So. A gang leader with no gang, and an info broker with no more info to break. What comes next?” 

“Hmmm...” The aforementioned info broker hummed to herself, tapping a finger to her chin. “Well, I think... Work. Things won’t be perfect here, sure. But they will be peaceful. I think neither of us mind a little rest and relaxation, at least for a moment. Am I wrong?”

Texas just smiled at that, adjusting her mother’s cap with her good arm. “Then here’s to rest and relaxation.”

…

*Outside, the crowd was cheering.* 
*Each voice was to be a thread in Rākinnagarh’s tapestry.*

*Growing through the concrete, the Nightblooms gathered ‘round to sing along.*

I believe life is better when shared with a little humor and a lot of curiosity.

I have a deep fascination with history, especially Ancient Greece. There’s something magical about sitting on old stones and pondering the meaning of life. Maybe I was a philosopher in a past life? But don’t worry, I’m fully modern now—coffee and anime are my fuel!

I’m also passionate about motorcycles and dream of exploring Europe on two wheels someday. Traveling feels like a grand adventure to me, and getting lost just adds more fun to the story.

1ifaym9,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ifaym9/is_my_dad_a_narcissist_with_examples/,Is my dad a narcissist? (with examples),"Please help.. could my dad be a narcissist?

I grew up with a very violent, abusive, passive aggressive, manipulative father who essentially traumatised our family to this day. He's still married to my mother because she has nowhere to go, and he gets away with it because he's toned it down over the years (after me confronting him numerous times - which I can feel he resents me for) and spoils us with meals and gifts here and there, but it's still very much there 'under the surface' all the time. My sister and I are now in our late 30's .

Having grown older, I think I'm finally coming to the realisation that he may be a narcissist which would explain a lot, but I would still appreciate other opinions.

I've compiled a list of things he's done repeatedly over the years, some quite specific, maybe some of these are recognisable to you?

1. **Treats strangers better than his family**. If my mother is blocking a walkway for example and strangers are trying to pass, he'll shout at her and pull her out the way as if the passer by is more important than his own wife and then berate her afterwards.
2. **Makes demeaning comparisons with other people**. If he sees an old friend of mine in a TV advert for example, the first thing he'll do is ask how my career is going and why I'm not up there on the TV yet.
3. **Wants to control conversations**. Needs so desperately to control every conversation, meal times etc, even if it's a topic nobody cares about, just to hear himself talk, and when someone else starts controlling the conversation he becomes all small, timid and almost child-like.
4. **Requires constant validation like a drug**. He's constantly telling me what he's done for me, for example he'll randomly come to me and say *'hey I re-stocked the fridge with that drink you like'* or *'I hope you enjoyed the dinner last night'* all in an attempt for me to say *'thank you'*. It's like he needs 100 thank-you's a day, whether in real-time or for something in the distant past of future.
5. **Blames everyone but himself**. We went on holiday last year and he forgot to pack an important item, so he blamed everyone else for not helping enough which meant he had to do too much which meant he forgot to pack it because he was overwhelmed.
6. **Downplays his mistakes**. When someone else make a mistake he'll shout and make a huge deal of it, but when he makes a mistake he'll shrug it off being like *'ok I'm sorry guys, I'm sorry, let's just forget about it'* and then change the subject very quickly or offer to go buy us ice cream 🍦
7. **Thinks he can do everything better**. He'll watch whatever someone else is doing like a hawk ready to correct them or their technique and then offer to step in to take over, for example packing the car or doing something around the house.
8. **Sulking**. If one of us says we're not interested in doing something or tell him he's out of line or he makes a mistake, he'll go into a huge sulking mode equivalent to a 6 year old. If you try talk to him he'll give you 1 word answers or just nod his head to let you know he's sulking. It's quite pathetic.
9. **Social anxiety**. I've noticed he gets very insecure in social settings, almost like he panics.
10. **Sense of entitlement**. He expects every situation to cater to his needs, whether it's a form of payment at a vendor, or that the escalators are operational in a foreign country at 4am. If not, he'll let it be know and throw a temper tantrum as if these people have let him down.
11. **Doesn't respect boundaries**. Whether I'm sleeping or lying outside with music in my ears trying to relax, he'll be sure to interrupt with some completely unimportant piece of information and will happily sabotage my relaxing time because he doesn't know how to relax himself.
12. **Extreme emotional volatility**. He'll sit down with his coffee and spill a drop on the table and explode with annoyance, stampeding around to get a dishcloth, and ruin the mood for everyone. He'll go from relatively calm to scarily angry from one second to the next.
13. **Ruins dinners and special occasions.** He'll happily bring up grievances on special occasions or get angry at a restaurant when we go out for dinner, and will knowingly ruin the evening out of arrogance and selfishness.
14. **Guilt tripping**. For example like the above situation, he'll then apologise, and say something like *'i'm sorry guys, I just always f things up blah blah blah'* and then go sit in the corner and sulk and read or something, hoping we feel sorry for him. Yes you are right though, you always f things up and we never do.
15. **Guilt tripping on steroids**. Numerous times he's brought up how much he's had to sacrifice in his life to give us the opportunities he has, and will often do so in a manic rage out of nowhere, and completely disproportionate to the intensity of the conversation that was happening before.
16. **Self pity**. It's him against the world, he's so perfect and can do no wrong, and almost everything around him is a disappointment. Unless it's someone very successful, then he thinks he's found his people, someone who understands him.
17. **Silent treatment**. Out of nowhere I'll notice that he is not responding as verbally anymore, like he's harbouring resentment for something I did or didn't do. Then I land up back-tracking through the day wondering what it was, maybe he feels unappreciated or is disappointed about how something went or how I reacted.

These are the most obvious ones, I could probably find another 10 or so but I think this gives a good idea of what we're dealing with. So does this sound like a narcissist?

I've been away from home for some days, and have to resort to drinking in various coffee places compared to my sweet setup at home.

While that's not bad at all, I've noticed something I had kind of brushed aside previously at home, but is now much more apparent, given that I have to repeat it with every shot. Has anyone noticed how much normal milk impacts the end flavor, and the complexity of the drink? Things I've noticed: 

1. Steamed milk adds a very particular ""caramel-light"" flavor to the drink, which can be quite overpowering and somewhat steer away from ""drinking coffee""

2. The complexity is greatly diminished. I can mostly just taste some bitterness, maybe a bit of nuttiness. It feels like any kind of clarity (e.g. flavor separation) has to go through the ""milk caramel filter"", which as stated is very overpowering 

3. By comparison, the green peas alternative milk I have settled for at home (go figure) is just as easy to froth, has that buttery-milk texture to it, but leaves the coffee to show its flavors so much more. If changing beans would land me one of say 10 different big categories (e.g. fruity, floral, nutty, chocolatey, roasty, toffee/caramel, etc etc), all beans I've tried so far just produce more or less the same category when it's ordinary milk.

I'm just curious if others have noticed this, and if I'm missing something.

Just to be clear, I don't think I'm overdosing the milk. While my shots are 9.5g in - 21g out, I only use around 70ish grams of milk, so somewhat of a cortado+.",1,1738429623.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I used to heavily watch porn before I met her. I recently switched to android from iPhone and didn't bring my pictures over. 

The other day I had strong urges and since I didn't have it available I decided to watch porn to do it. In the end I watched a few vids but I couldn't do it. I just went about my morning making coffee and went on the computer. Last night she saw my history and woke me up to ask me about it. I tried to explain that what I was watching didn't matter to me and sometimes it just felt like a chore I had to do to start my day and that I don't think of other woman over her. I don't or ever want to be with anyone else. 

She thinks that ive been lying about watching it now all these years. She said that no matter how many times I say sorry she won't forgive me and I can't even think of the possibility of losing her.

I'm Pudgy Cat, and this is my first post here. 

I've been lurking for a while, and this community seems like a good place to connect with other Cardano enthusiasts. I've heard good things, especially compared to some other online spaces, so I thought I'd introduce myself.

I've been involved with Cardano since January 2022 (about three years now), and I run this small, personal, cat-themed project that I started as a creative outlet. My background is in writing (professionally, in fact), though I also have some IT experience (which I studied, but later moved away from for a more creative career). This project allows me to combine those interests. Some of you might have already come across me on X, or in some older content published on Dapp Central or Cardano Over Coffee.

In my first year, I've experimented with token creation and have released a couple of NFT collections, but I'm not particularly focused on the speculative side of crypto. I'm more interested in Cardano's underlying philosophy, its vision, and its academic approach. My little community is pretty laid-back; just a small group of people who enjoy discussing Cardano and, well, cats.

Later, I've spent more time interacting a bit with other Cardano projects and communities, like Cornucopias, NEWM, Genius Yield, and others. I've also been working on some content creation, including a sci-fi-comedy podcast-style show on YouTube called ""The Great Beyond"", and I recently published a cat-themed book, ""Catnip and Chaos"", available on Amazon. During these years I've also applied for Project Catalyst funding twice, and while the feedback has been positive, I haven't been successful in the voting stage.

Right now I'm slowly working on some online tutorials and music projects that I plan to share on here in future. Hopefully, some of you might find them interesting. 

I have a lot more to share, but I didn't want to overwhelm everyone with a huge first post. I'm looking forward to getting to know this community and joining the discussions. Thanks for having me.",4,1738429197.0,cardano,10,0.64,False

as a home roaster just looking to start upping my output and selling the odd bag of coffee, it's occured to me that i need to think about my cupping process and being able to actually REALLY determine if i've nailed a roast. with this in mind, what are your guys' thoughts on grind distribution for coffee cupping?

i've gone down the unimodal / bimodal rabbit hole here and i'm just wondering if i reeaally want to get something like a 1zpresso zp6 for maximum clarity at the expense of some body. people say that more unimodal grind settings flourish in percolation brew, but of course cupping is an immersion method.

bear in mind: i roast, drink and enjoy light roasted coffes. i'm not very fussed about body in coffee, (i feel like i just answered my own question here) but would i be missing out on a key aspect of my tasting process by buying a grinder that minimises it? also, my preferences are not everyone else's preferences.

my current grinder, a knock aergrind, produces quite a lot of fines, but more importantly does not seem consistent grind to grind. this is the most frustrating part for me. should i be prioritising a super consistent grinder over time, or by particle size?

any thoughts or experience relating to the above would be most welcome!

It lift after 8pm but by then, it's too late to start a longish game. I'm searching for little motivation tips that will make starting a game easier instead of doom scrolling the web all evening.

Here some tips I think might help already;

1. \- The 5min method. Just think that you need to do it for 5min. That help not feeling overwhelmed, 
2. \- Somehow make a ritual of it, a bit like my morning coffee start my working day,
3. \- Setup the game beforehand,
4. \- Block the distractions. Remove the chair from the computer desk. Shut down the damn thing.
5. \- Put some thematic soundtrack,
6. \- The ""medieval peasant"" method; Switch your mindset to a medieval peasant discovering the modern world. Wow! What is this prodigious box full of little colorful cards? Little figures with swords? Such fine details!! I must touch! I must PLAY!!!
7. \- More coffee (or a ritalin booster in my case), but that will affect my beauty sleep and take a toll on the next day.

I was able to play Dune Imperium and Cthulhu Death may Die as the strong theme help with motivation. I failed with Marvel Champion and Spirit Island, setuping the game, learning the rules but never playing a full round. I'm trying Arkham Horror LCG now. Played the first scenario 3 times. Amazing! The second scenario is set on my table since 2 weeks but I just stare at it with anxiety. This morning I'm doing it. I CAN DO IT!!!

Looking for genuine friendships in my-timezone™.","tl;dr;  I've moved to Sweden to work as a graphics programmer and making meaningful friends as an adult in the year of our lord TikTok 2025 is pretty hard. 

So let's play something?

- - - -

**Introduction**

It's the weekend, you've just worked on some personal projects at some coffee shop and now you are back home. 

You look at your brand new copy of ""Unrailed 2: Back on Track"", great game for remote play together, but can't co-op because most people you play games with are in time zones that are hard schedule with. 

Now you find yourself on r/Gamerpals trying to meet some people, maybe good friends? Who knows!

So a little bit about me: even though I grew up online, I'm absolutely do not fit with the mainstream ""we are all depressed"" mainstream online persona, even though I share a lot of the sentiments motivated by it. I'm overall pretty enthusiastic and huge proponent for personal growth! 

I love when people are deeply interested in something, work hard on their own interests, build projects, whatever it is. I would say this is a major part of my personality.

I don't play very consistently, these days it's more of a social thing for me rather than the hobby I'd choose to do by myself, but here are some games I'd like to play:

- Unrailed 2
- Stardew Valley
- Minecraft
- Terraria
- Rabbit and Steel
- Barony
- Factorio
- Lethal Company
- Hidden Deep
- Any Dark Souls
- Project Zomboid
- Barotrauma
- Any retro games!

Or feel free to suggest anything! Comfy coop games are very much my thing.
I'm also open to just streaming and chatting, both ways.

Some stuff I like:

- Cooking
- Reading
- Soundtracks and instrumental music
- Math, coding, Picross, solving problems!
- Public speaking, especially when my gut tells me not to
- Comfy games (Stardew valley, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, Project Zomboid, Abiotic Factor) 
- DOGGOS, and cats, kinda, they have a way
- Horror movies and games

Some stuff I dislike:
- A lot of guy groups have this ""bro culture"" that I can't stand.
- Live service games... I just like full experiences that have an ending and aren't optimizing for wasting time.

 Random facts:

- I like Moomin
- Meal prepped for the past 5 years
- I use ""Unhook"" to improve my YouTube experience.
- I really wanna play Animal Well.
- Weirdest compliment I've received was _""You should read smut on booktok""_ because of my voice. 
- Second weirdest was _""Do you do ASMR requests""_.
- Once wrote a Game Boy emulator, it's like my ""peaked at high school"".
- Finished the Duolingo's Russian tree, I still don't know Russian, да.",3,1738428436.0,GamerPals,0,0.71,False

A woman in front of me started to use her phone excessively. I wouldn't mind if she used it to check the time, but it looked like she was texting. After what felt like 5 minutes (probably was only a minute), I bent down and whispered to her it's distracting. She put it away, then pulled it out again after a bit to use it for a while. I bent down and started poking around her phone, not knowing what I was poking at because it's none of my business, I was just poking at it. I didn't do it for a full second because she immediately put it down and said ""what the fuck??"" I heard a person say ""shhh"". Second time she pulled out her phone, I did it again. She never pulled her phone out again. 

I didn't give a shit because if she would report this, either we'd both be out or she would, because she would be outing herself. The only way a stranger can poke at your phone is if you have your phone out. I thought the way I handled it was quiet, I told her once that it was distracting, she was the one who pulled out her phone, but at the same time, I did put my finger on her belonging, which is why I'm here.

I don't want to go out of the movie theater to report. Have y'all ever done that? Does it often work? If so then the movie theaters I go to suck here. I don't want to miss out on a scene because of some person who felt at home out in public.

After years of yearning, my girlfriend and I are planning to buy into the espresso game. We currently use  a Baratza Encore and a Bonavita coffee maker that we run through a Chemex. We would love to stay around $2,500 total, but would spend $3,000 if necessary. Currently, we are thinking the Ascasa Steel Duo with PID (or maybe the plus) and a Timemore 064S, but wanted opinions as to whether that pairing made sense. We would like to get a grinder that works for espresso and filter, but we would consider keeping our encore for the filter until we can upgrade that, as well. For our filter, we also usually grind ~65g , so we plan to add the extended hopper for the Timemore, and the ability to grind that much is a huge plus for the grinder; we’d prefer not to have to do multiple doses to make a pot of drip/pour over. Is there a better combo that meets our needs? We have also considered the Gevi Grindmaster and potentially doing the Gaggiuino. Thanks in advance!",1,1738428312.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ifa8j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaBeach/comments/1ifa8j5/virginia_beach_police/,Virginia Beach Police,"Hi everyone, I just need some advice on how I should handle an investigation that was done poorly. Yesterday my upstairs neighbor was abusing her son. She threatened to stab him, was throwing him against the ground, cut his hair, and scratched up his hand bad. I called 911 and got video of the altercation as well as them being able to hear her doing these things. Dispatcher asked me if I would speak to police and I adamantly agreed, I had to go to work but I needed the police to see the abuse she was causing. When they came they made a whole lot of excuses for the mother and I really thought it was to not traumatize the boy any more (he’s 13) the boy got picked up by his sister. Mom is still upstairs. She was never taken away that I know of. The police never came to speak with me, I stayed home from work to speak with them about all of this. I just feel like none of this was done correctly. She was threatening to stab him. Child abuse is at least a class 1 misdemeanor right? Why wasn’t she arrested? I reached out to the Virginia Beach Police Department to tell them I’d like to speak with them and went to voicemail. I reached out to CPS but didn’t have much information at all besides their address and that there would be a police report but idk if it will even be classified as child abuse. I also reached out to our apartment complex because I just feel unsafe. If she’s willing to do that to her own child idk what she’d be willing to do to me for just calling it in. I’m pregnant as well and just a bundle of nerves after all of this. I just feel disgusted and don’t know what to do. I have evidence of this woman doing these things and I was never talked to. I’m just really upset. What should I do going further? 

TL;DR
Called the police on my abusive upstairs neighbor after she was beating her son. She was threatening to stab him and keeping him stuck in the apartment when he was trying to leave. All over food from DoorDash apparently she didn’t get her coffee when HE ordered food. Cops never spoke to me and she wasn’t taken away. I heard the police making a whole bunch of excuses for her and I can’t help but think she was manipulating the whole situation and got away with it BECAUSE THEY WOULDN’T TALK TO ME. I called and told them I’d be happy to speak to police. I called the department and got voicemail. Called CPS. What should I do going forward?",4,1738427944.0,VirginiaBeach,8,0.64,False

1ifa5l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1ifa5l5/rate_my_prompt_im_a_nursing_student_in_my_last/,Rate my prompt. I’m a nursing student in my last semester,"Prompt: 

I need you to create high-yield, NCLEX-style questions based on the material I provide from either my PowerPoint slides or book readings. The objective is to cover all provided testable material with a primary focus on the exemplars, which I will specify before you begin generating questions.

These questions must require critical thinking, application, and analysis rather than simple recall. They should be designed in a way that challenges my understanding of patient education, treatment modalities, and nursing interventions, ensuring that I am fully prepared for my exams.

Guidelines:

✔ Before generating questions, ask me to specify the exemplars so you know what concepts require the highest focus.
✔ Each question must present a clinical scenario incorporating age, history, assessment findings, or nursing interventions where applicable.
✔ Answer choices must be plausible and carefully crafted to avoid obvious elimination, encouraging critical thinking.
✔ The correct answer must be supported by a detailed rationale, explaining why it is correct and why the other choices are incorrect.
✔ Use appropriate medical terminology in alignment with NCLEX standards while ensuring clarity.
✔ Avoid repetition while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all material provided.

Format Examples:

Question 1

A 45-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with petechiae, purpura, and a platelet count of 18,000/µL. The patient reports taking aspirin daily for chronic pain. What is the priority nursing intervention?

A. Administer a platelet transfusion.
B. Discontinue aspirin therapy and notify the healthcare provider.
C. Encourage the patient to increase dietary iron intake.
D. Initiate heparin therapy to prevent clotting.

✔ Answer: B - Discontinue aspirin therapy and notify the healthcare provider.

✔ Rationale: Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, which can significantly increase the risk of bleeding in a patient with thrombocytopenia. The priority intervention is to stop the causative agent and notify the healthcare provider. Platelet transfusions are reserved for severe or life-threatening hemorrhage.

Question 2

A client is being admitted to the high-risk OB unit at 36 weeks gestation with a history of chronic hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Shortly after admission, she starts complaining of a severe headache and visual disturbances. The nurse takes her vital signs and gets these results: BP 178/100 mm Hg: Pulse 90 beats per minute: Respirations 20 breaths per minute; T 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on this information what does the nurse anticipate the healthcare provider to prescribe? 

A. Nifedipine

B. Hydralazine 

C. Labetalol

D. Indomethacin 

Answer: B - Hydralazine 

Rationale: This client is experiencing a hypertensive crisis and should be prescribed hydralazine. Nifedipine and Labetalol are both hypertensive meds and are not given in a crisis scenario. Indomethacin is used to treat preterm labor. 

Source Text: (PowerPoint Slide #__, or Book Title, Page __, “Exact Sentence Used”)


Question 3

A client is admitted for cardiogenic shock. A pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is inserted and hemodynamic numbers are obtained. The values are CVP = 9, PCWP = 15, CO = 1.7, SVR = 850. The client has an ejection fraction of 30%. What prescription does the nurse anticipate for this client? 

A. Dobutamine

B. Nitroglycerin 

C. Nitroprusside 

D. Norepinephrine 

Answer: A - Dobutamine 

Rationale: In cardiogenic shock, the client does not have adequate contractility. Dobutamine, a beta-agonist will cause increased contractility to improve the EF with the positive inotropic effect. Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside will cause vasodilation and worsen the condition. Norepinephrine will cause vasoconstriction, but dobutamine is a better choice because of the positive inotropic effect. 

Source Text: (PowerPoint Slide #__, or Book Title, Page __, “Exact Sentence Used”)


Question 4

The nurse is caring for a client in the acute phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who is sedated and on a paralytic agent. Which ventilator settings would the nurse anticpate for this client?

A. A/C 20, PEEP 8, FiO2 60, TV-400

B. CPAP, PS-10, PEEP-5, FiO2 65

C. SIMV 5, PS 10, FiO2 40, TV-450, PEEP-5

D. BiPAP 12/8, FiO2 80

Answer: A - A/C 20, PEEP 8, FiO2 60, TV-400

Rationale: ARDS clients need low tidal volume, frequent breaths, and the lowest PEEP that attains good ABGs, CPAP with pressure support is insufficient to keep the alveoli open. The client needs controlled breaths and more support because the client is so weak. Thus A/C is required and not SIMV. BiPAP is not adequate for a client in ARDS or on a paralytic. 

Question 5

Which statement by the nurse demonstrates proper oxygen administration for a preterm neonate? (Select all that apply)

A. “Cool humidified oxygen helps maintain the neonate’s temperature and prevent insensible water loss.”

B. “CPAP may be administered to keep the neonate’s alveoli open and improve expansion of the lungs.”

C. “Oxygen will be titrated by monitoring pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases as to prevent problems for the neonate.”

D. “Positioning the neonate prone increases oxygenation.”

E. “Ventilator settings may be adjusted to fast, frequent respirations with increased pressure to decrease the risk of lung injury.”

Answers: B, C, D

Rationale: The first option is incorrect. Oxygen must be humidified to prevent insensible water loss and drying of the delicate mucous membranes. However, it must also be warmed to maintain body temperature. CPAP may be used to keep the alveoli open and improve lung expansion. Oxygen must be closely monitored and titrated to prevent problems for the neonate. Hypoxia and hyperoxygenation can lead to complications for the neonate. Positioning the preterm neonate prone does increase oxygenation. Also, side lying and prone position facilitate the drainage of respiratory secretions and regurgitate feedings. Ventilatory settings may be adjusted to fast, frequent respirations with decreased pressure to reduce the risk of lung injury, not increased pressure.

Key Expectations for Every Question:

✔ Realistic clinical scenarios requiring decision-making.
✔ Prioritization, delegation, and patient safety considerations.
✔ Integration of lab values, medication effects, and nursing interventions into the reasoning.
✔ Patient education scenarios emphasizing correct teaching points.

✔ Ensure all questions follow this format, incorporating high-level NCLEX-style critical thinking scenarios.

✔ For each question, include:
	•	The exact source used (PowerPoint slide number or book reference).
	•	The sentence or concept from the source that was used to create the question.

Continuing the Question Set Prompt:

If I tell you to continue, you must retain the original formatting, rules, and goals of this prompt. You must continue generating questions while ensuring that:

✔ You do not lose track of the exemplars I specified at the beginning.
✔ You continue covering all material without repetition while maintaining sufficient detail and critical thinking scenarios.
✔ You acknowledge how many total questions we need to generate to ensure we meet the goal (e.g., 100 questions) and keep track of progress.

When I say “Continue”, start generating the next set of questions without altering the formatting or question quality, maintaining the same level of clinical depth and rationale detail.

Final Notes:
	•	Before you start, ask me to list the exemplars from the material provided.
	•	Ensure all content is focused on testable material from my PowerPoint or book readings.
	•	Questions should progressively challenge my understanding of key nursing concepts, ensuring I am fully prepared for my exam.


ChatGP responses: 

### Question 1

A 32-year-old male is admitted to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8, unequal pupils, and irregular respirations. His blood pressure is 170/60 mmHg, and his pulse is 48 bpm. What is the priority nursing action?

A. Administer mannitol IV per provider order

B. Prepare the patient for emergent intubation

C. Place the patient in the Trendelenburg position

D. Obtain a stat head CT and wait for results

✔ Answer: B. Prepare the patient for emergent intubation

✔ Rationale:

This patient exhibits Cushing’s Triad (hypertension with widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, and irregular respirations), which indicates increased intracranial pressure (IICP) and impending brain herniation. Airway protection is the priority because decreasing LOC and abnormal respirations can lead to respiratory failure.

- A (Mannitol) is appropriate for IICP but is not the first priority over airway management.
- C (Trendelenburg) would increase ICP and is contraindicated.
- D (Head CT) is needed but should not delay airway stabilization.

✔ Source: Lewis, p. 1487-1488 (“Cushing’s Triad and signs of IICP”)

### Question 2

A nurse is caring for a 6-year-old child diagnosed with a basilar skull fracture after a fall from a playground structure. Which assessment finding requires immediate intervention?

A. Clear fluid leaking from the child’s nose

B. Ecchymosis behind the ears

C. Mild headache with nausea

D. GCS score of 14 with parental concern about behavior changes

✔ Answer: A. Clear fluid leaking from the child’s nose

✔ Rationale:

Clear nasal drainage in a patient with a basilar skull fracture suggests cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, which increases the risk of meningitis. Immediate intervention is required to prevent infection and monitor for worsening neurological status.

- B (Ecchymosis behind the ears, or Battle’s sign) is associated with basilar skull fractures but does not require immediate intervention.
- C (Mild headache and nausea) are expected symptoms of a concussion but are not life-threatening.
- D (GCS 14 and behavior changes) requires monitoring but is not an emergency.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1495-1497 (“Basilar Skull Fracture—Signs & Management”)

### Question 3

A patient with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is receiving mechanical ventilation. The nurse notes an ICP of 22 mmHg and a CPP of 50 mmHg. Which intervention should the nurse anticipate?

A. Increase the patient’s IV fluid rate to improve perfusion

B. Administer 3% hypertonic saline per provider order

C. Lower the head of the bed to increase cerebral blood flow

D. Administer an opioid analgesic to lower blood pressure

✔ Answer: B. Administer 3% hypertonic saline per provider order

✔ Rationale:

ICP should be < 20 mmHg, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) should be ≥ 60 mmHg to ensure adequate brain perfusion. 3% hypertonic saline or mannitol reduces cerebral edema and decreases ICP by drawing fluid from brain tissue into circulation.

- A (Increasing IV fluids) could worsen cerebral edema.
- C (Lowering HOB) would increase ICP—HOB should be kept at 30°.
- D (Opioids) may lower BP further and worsen cerebral perfusion.

### Question 4

A nurse is caring for a patient with an epidural hematoma after a fall. Initially, the patient lost consciousness, then regained full alertness, but now is rapidly deteriorating. What is the nurse’s priority action?

A. Notify the provider and prepare for emergent surgical intervention

B. Monitor neurological status every 2 hours

C. Elevate the head of the bed to 45 degrees and administer pain medication

D. Encourage fluids to prevent dehydration and maintain blood pressure

✔ Answer: A. Notify the provider and prepare for emergent surgical intervention

✔ Rationale:

Epidural hematomas are arterial bleeds, often causing a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration due to expanding hematoma and increased ICP. This is a neurosurgical emergency requiring immediate evacuation of the hematoma.

- B (Neuro monitoring every 2 hours) is inadequate given the rapid deterioration.
- C (HOB 45° and pain meds) may be appropriate but do not address the emergency.
- D (Encouraging fluids) is not relevant and could increase ICP.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1497-1502 (“Epidural Hematoma—Pathophysiology & Management”)

---

### Question 5

A patient with increased ICP has an intraventricular catheter in place for monitoring and CSF drainage. Which nursing intervention is most appropriate?

A. Maintain strict sterile technique when handling the catheter

B. Keep the drainage system clamped at all times to prevent CSF over-drainage

C. Position the patient flat to promote drainage and reduce pressure

D. Irrigate the catheter with normal saline if CSF flow is sluggish

✔ Answer: A. Maintain strict sterile technique when handling the catheter

✔ Rationale:

An intraventricular catheter (external ventricular drain, EVD) provides direct ICP monitoring and allows CSF drainage. Because it penetrates the brain, infection prevention is crucial, requiring strict sterile technique to prevent meningitis or ventriculitis.

- B (Clamping the system) can lead to increased ICP if CSF cannot drain.
- C (Positioning flat) increases ICP—HOB should be at 30°.
- D (Irrigating the catheter) is contraindicated, as it could introduce infection or damage brain tissue.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1488-1491 (“ICP Monitoring & Nursing Considerations”)

---

### Question 6

A patient with a newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme asks the nurse about the prognosis. Which response by the nurse is most appropriate?

A. “Glioblastomas grow slowly, and most patients respond well to treatment.”

B. “This type of tumor is aggressive, and treatment focuses on symptom management and quality of life.”

C. “Chemotherapy and radiation usually cure glioblastoma if it is detected early.”

D. “Surgery is always curative, but follow-up treatment is needed to prevent recurrence.”

✔ Answer: B. This type of tumor is aggressive, and treatment focuses on symptom management and quality of life.

✔ Rationale:

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor, with a poor prognosis (<2 years survival despite treatment). Care focuses on symptom relief, palliative measures, and quality of life.

- A is incorrect because glioblastomas grow rapidly, not slowly.
- C is incorrect because there is no cure; treatment is palliative.
- D is incorrect because surgery cannot cure glioblastoma—it only helps relieve pressure.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1502-1508 (“Brain Tumors—Classification and Prognosis”)

### Question 7

**A nurse is preparing a patient with a brain tumor for cranial surgery. Which preoperative intervention is most important?**

A. Shaving the entire scalp to reduce infection risk

B. Administering dexamethasone as prescribed

C. Placing the patient in high Fowler’s position to decrease ICP

D. Performing deep suctioning before transport to the operating room

✔ Answer: B. Administering dexamethasone as prescribed

✔ Rationale:

Dexamethasone (Decadron) is a corticosteroid used preoperatively in brain tumor patients to reduce cerebral edema and lower ICP, improving neurological function before surgery.

- A (Shaving the entire scalp) is outdated; only the surgical site is clipped.
- C (High Fowler’s position) could lower BP excessively, reducing cerebral perfusion.
- D (Deep suctioning) can increase ICP and should be avoided unless necessary.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1502-1508 (“Cranial Surgery—Preoperative Care”)

### Question 8

A nurse is educating a patient diagnosed with migraine headaches. Which statement by the patient requires further teaching?

A. “I should keep a headache diary to identify my triggers.”

B. “I will take sumatriptan as soon as my headache starts.”

C. “I should limit caffeine intake because it can trigger migraines.”

D. “If I develop chest pain after taking sumatriptan, I should ignore it.”

✔ Answer: D. If I develop chest pain after taking sumatriptan, I should ignore it.

✔ Rationale:

Sumatriptan (Imitrex) is a serotonin receptor agonist used to treat migraines by causing vasoconstriction. It can cause coronary vasospasm, leading to chest pain or serious cardiac events. Any chest pain should be reported immediately.

- A (Keeping a headache diary) helps identify triggers.
- B (Taking sumatriptan at onset) is correct to prevent progression.
- C (Limiting caffeine) is correct because caffeine can be a trigger.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1538-1544 (“Migraine Pharmacology—Triptans”)

---

### Question 9

A patient is experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure in the hospital. Which intervention should the nurse perform first?

A. Restrain the patient’s arms and legs to prevent injury

B. Insert an oral airway to maintain a patent airway

C. Turn the patient to the side and protect their head

D. Administer lorazepam IV immediately

✔ Answer: C. Turn the patient to the side and protect their head

✔ Rationale:

During a tonic-clonic seizure, the priority is airway protection. Placing the patient in a side-lying position prevents aspiration, and protecting the head minimizes trauma.

- A (Restraints) can cause injury and should never be used.
- B (Oral airway insertion) is contraindicated during a seizure due to the risk of injury.
- D (Lorazepam) is appropriate but should be given after safety measures are in place.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1545-1554 (“Seizure Nursing Management”)

### Question 10

A nurse is caring for a patient in status epilepticus. Which medication should the nurse anticipate administering first?

A. IV lorazepam (Ativan)

B. IV fosphenytoin (Cerebyx)

C. IV levetiracetam (Keppra)

D. PO carbamazepine (Tegretol)

✔ Answer: A. IV lorazepam (Ativan)

✔ Rationale:

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency requiring immediate IV benzodiazepines to stop the seizure. IV lorazepam (Ativan) is the first-line drug due to its rapid onset and long duration.

- B (Fosphenytoin) is a second-line medication used if benzodiazepines fail.
- C (Levetiracetam) is used for long-term seizure control, not acute SE.
- D (Carbamazepine) is oral and not effective for emergencies.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1549-1550 (“Status Epilepticus—Emergency Management”)

### Question 11

A patient with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) has an intracranial pressure (ICP) of 25 mmHg. The nurse implements several interventions to reduce ICP. Which action requires intervention by the charge nurse?

A. Keeping the patient’s head in a neutral position

B. Suctioning the patient’s airway for 15 seconds every 2 hours

C. Administering mannitol as prescribed

D. Maintaining the head of the bed at 30 degrees

✔ Answer: B. Suctioning the patient’s airway for 15 seconds every 2 hours

✔ Rationale:

Suctioning can increase ICP by stimulating the vagus nerve and inducing coughing. Suction should be performed only when absolutely necessary and should be limited to less than 10 seconds with hyperoxygenation before and after.

- A (Neutral head positioning) prevents venous compression and promotes CSF drainage.
- C (Mannitol) is an osmotic diuretic that reduces cerebral edema and lowers ICP.
- D (HOB 30°) optimizes venous drainage without compromising cerebral perfusion.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1491-1495 (“Nursing Management of Increased ICP”)

### Question 12

A 28-year-old patient with a history of epilepsy is prescribed phenytoin (Dilantin). Which patient statement indicates a need for further teaching?

A. “I should have my blood levels checked regularly.”

B. “I can stop taking my medication if I haven’t had a seizure in a year.”

C. “I should brush and floss regularly to prevent gum problems.”

D. “I will avoid alcohol while taking this medication.”

✔ Answer: B. ‘I can stop taking my medication if I haven’t had a seizure in a year.’

✔ Rationale:

Patients should never stop taking antiseizure medications abruptly, as this increases the risk of rebound seizures or status epilepticus. Antiseizure medications are typically lifelong, and discontinuation must be supervised by a provider with a slow taper.

- A (Regular blood level checks) are necessary because phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic range (10-20 mcg/mL).
- C (Oral hygiene) is essential because phenytoin can cause gingival hyperplasia.
- D (Avoiding alcohol) is correct because alcohol lowers seizure threshold.

### Question 13

A nurse is evaluating the effectiveness of mannitol therapy in a patient with increased ICP. Which assessment finding indicates that the treatment is effective?

A. Decreased urine output and stable neurological status

B. Reduced ICP and improved Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score

C. Increased blood pressure and increased pupil reactivity

D. Worsening headache and increased serum osmolality

✔ Answer: B. Reduced ICP and improved Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score

✔ Rationale:

Mannitol (osmotic diuretic) reduces cerebral edema, leading to:

✔ Lower ICP readings

✔ Improved neurological function (e.g., better GCS score)

- A (Decreased urine output) would indicate ineffective diuresis, suggesting possible kidney dysfunction.
- C (Increased BP) does not indicate mannitol effectiveness.
- D (Worsening headache & increased serum osmolality) may indicate worsening dehydration or hyperosmolarity, a potential complication.

### Question 14

A nurse is teaching a patient newly diagnosed with tension headaches. Which lifestyle modification should the nurse recommend first?

A. “Drink 2-3 cups of coffee daily to prevent headaches.”

B. “Use a headache diary to track patterns and triggers.”

C. “Take sumatriptan at the first sign of a headache.”

D. “Increase sodium intake to maintain fluid balance.”

✔ Answer: B. Use a headache diary to track patterns and triggers.

✔ Rationale:

A headache diary helps patients identify triggers (e.g., stress, sleep deprivation, dehydration), allowing for preventive strategies.

- A (Caffeine) may worsen headaches in some individuals.
- C (Sumatriptan) is not effective for tension headaches, as it is used for migraines.
- D (Increasing sodium intake) is not recommended.

### Question 15

**A pregnant patient in her third trimester has a history of migraine headaches and asks about safe medications. Which prescription would the nurse question?**

A. Acetaminophen

B. Sumatriptan

C. Beta blockers (e.g., propranolol)

D. Topiramate

✔ Answer: D. Topiramate

✔ Rationale:

Topiramate (Topamax) is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its association with fetal cleft lip/palate and neurodevelopmental issues.

- A (Acetaminophen) is safe for pain relief in pregnancy.
- B (Sumatriptan) is generally safe for acute migraine attacks.
- C (Beta blockers) can be used preventively in pregnancy for migraines.

### Question 16

A patient with a closed head injury suddenly develops ipsilateral pupil dilation and contralateral hemiparesis. The nurse suspects uncal herniation. What is the priority nursing intervention?

A. Notify the provider immediately and prepare for emergency surgery

B. Lower the head of the bed to 10 degrees to improve cerebral perfusion

C. Administer an opioid analgesic to reduce metabolic demand

D. Continue neurological assessments every 2 hours

✔ Answer: A. Notify the provider immediately and prepare for emergency surgery

✔ Rationale:

Uncal herniation occurs when increased ICP compresses the brainstem, leading to pupil dilation (CN III compression) and motor deficits (contralateral hemiparesis). This is a medical emergency requiring urgent neurosurgical intervention.

- B (Lowering the HOB) would worsen ICP. Keep the HOB at 30 degrees.
- C (Opioids) may reduce pain but do not address the underlying emergency.
- D (Neurological assessments) are necessary but should not delay emergency intervention.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1487-1488 (“Signs of Brain Herniation”)

### Question 17

A patient with status epilepticus remains seizing despite IV lorazepam administration. Which next action should the nurse anticipate?

A. Administer IV fosphenytoin or levetiracetam

B. Restrain the patient’s limbs to prevent injury

C. Prepare for an emergent lumbar puncture

D. Perform a sternal rub to assess for consciousness

✔ Answer: A. Administer IV fosphenytoin or levetiracetam

✔ Rationale:

If benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam) fail to stop status epilepticus, IV antiseizure medications (e.g., fosphenytoin, phenytoin, valproic acid, or levetiracetam) should be given next.

- B (Restraints) can cause injury and should never be used during a seizure.
- C (Lumbar puncture) is not indicated unless infection is suspected.
- D (Sternal rub) is inappropriate—the patient is seizing and unresponsive.

✔ Source: Lewis, pp. 1549-1550 (“Status Epilepticus—Pharmacologic Management”)

### Question 18

A nurse is monitoring a 6-year-old child with a febrile seizure. Which statement by the child’s parent indicates a need for further education?

A. “I should use acetaminophen to reduce my child’s fever.”

B. “I will make sure my child gets plenty of fluids and rest.”

C. “I should start my child on antiseizure medication to prevent future seizures.”

D. “I will turn my child to the side if they have another seizure.”

✔ Answer: C. ‘I should start my child on antiseizure medication to prevent future seizures.’

✔ Rationale:

Febrile seizures do not require long-term antiseizure medication unless they become recurrent or prolonged. Treatment focuses on fever control and preventing injury during seizures.

- A (Acetaminophen) is correct for fever management.
- B (Fluids & rest) helps prevent dehydration and promotes recovery.
- D (Side-lying position) is correct for airway protection.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ifa08g,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1ifa08g/ventasking_for_validation_and_support/,vent/asking for validation and support,"hi all - I hope everyone who is about to sit for the February exam is hanging in. I'm sitting for it and it will be my third time sitting for this horrendous exam. I am upset with my partner and need to vent / humbly ask for a little validation from other bar-sitters. 

My boyfriend of more than 3 years is generally a very supportive, thoughtful, acts-of-service partner. However, in light of the upcoming bar exam and my study schedule, he continues to give me a hard time for not wanting to spend more time with him. Through the end of 2024, my studying barely affected our time together. In early January, I shared that the next 8 weeks will need to be a big sacrifice of time - it isn't that I don't want to spend time with him, it's just that I *can't*. I work a full time job and have an energetic dog who needs attention and on top of that I am trying to study for the bar and make this my last time. I was clear our relationship is very important to me, but I need early mornings and late nights of studying for two months. I shared that when I studied for the bar exam previously, I kept thinking I still had enough time left for sufficient review, practice, etc., and I did not. I am already horrified emotionally and financially to be taking this a THIRD time, and I need it to be my LAST time.  I told him I would much rather be spending time with him than studying, but time is immutable and I just need to study. He said he understood. 

However, while he's happy to take care of my dog for a few days at a time and cook some meals for me, he keeps giving me these little comments about how he ""thought \[I\] would want to hang out longer"" or ""thought \[I\] would have more time"" for him, especially when it comes to me getting up early. He's also made comments about being disappointed that I don't feel like having sex as often.  I've shared that ""it isn't that I don't want to spend time/have sex, I'm just incredibly anxious, exhausted, or both right now."" He backs off after I say that, but will still act disappointed all over again the next night. No matter how many times I've said at night ""I have to be up and out early tomorrow"", or ""I am going to sneak out of bed and start studying early"", he will still act surprised and disappointed when I do those things. 

I am not acting grumpy or persnickety towards him. I remain generally upbeat; I don't lash out at him and I am still engaging with his life. I bring him coffee in the morning and bring him breakfast in bed when he stays at my place. I ask him about his day, ask about his coworkers and family members, thank him repeatedly for helping take care of my dog and for the meals and snacks he's made me. I am mindful to at least try to minimize how the stress I am under impacts people around me. 

Yet, these little comments and mini-guilt trips continue. I have now tearfully pleaded at least 3 times for understanding, and explained that when he says these little comments, they really stress me out and distract me from studying. I've shared, repeatedly, that I am embarassed and ashamed to have not passed the bar twice, and absolutely need to put the time in to make sure I can pass this stupid exam once and for all and move on with my life. I shared that I can't wait for this to be over in large part so we can have more quality time together! Weekends away! Hikes with the dog! I also pointed out that he stands to benefit from me passing - I won't ever have to do this again!! The studying phase of my life is over!! I encouraged him to check out Reddit threads of bar sitters and their partners, all explaining how the sacrifice and the stress is all very real. I also gently pointed out that sitting for the exam is so stressful to some that they engage in self-harm... I am not exaggering that studying for this is SO MUCH and often wrapped up in shame, anxiety, hopelessness, etc. And I've shared that I have lost valuable time (including right this minute, as I type this), processing his comments and behaviors when I need that time to study or rest. 

Which brings us to this morning. Last night, we shared snacks and a movie, and I said I need to be up and out of his place on the early side. When I was headed out at 830am, he sulked and commented that he thought I might want to stay in bed longer. 

I'm at the end of my rope. I don't \*want\* to do this, but part of me is considering just saying that I can't cope with these little comments and guilt trips and sulking, and I can just see him after the bar exam. I don't think that bodes well for our future, but at the moment, all I want to do is pass this fucking exam and move on with my life. 

TL, DR: Normally very supportive boyfriend continues to make guilt-inducing comments that I don't have enough time for him as I prepare to sit for the bar for the third (ugh) time. Have clearly shared my feelings repeatedly and am very frustrated and sad. Asking for validation from bar sitters that this whole situation sucks. ",2,1738427324.0,barexam,2,1.0,False

Honestly though, I hate this thing. I read some reviews and I know it isn't a recommended grinder, but is it relatively indicative of hand grinders in general? Or is a nicer hand grinder going to be easier/less awkward to use? Will the final product in a better grinder be significantly better?

 :me and my ex broke up a month ago and hes blocked on almost every social. i asked in my journal about a sign: if (my exs name) and I come back together or we are made for eachother please give me a sign. i wrote about 5 signs (for example 7 or 777,7777; or his name repeated) and now see what happened. i see everywhere his name and my teacher sent us a text message and there was a prayer before exam and it was a prayer for saint (my exs name). and the last exercise on these exam was about this saint with his name.

A simple phone conversation yesterday confirmed the total all in price of £360 for a movement service at the official Tudor/Rolex service centre. 6-8 weeks turnaround.

Contrast with this. 

I googled and rang around and got in touch with a (famous) London Tudor boutique who were unclear what was offered on service level (case, movement, bracelet refurb), deliberately vague on pricing and indicated that if it was over 10 years old would cost more. They wanted to send it off for estimate and advise. They also stated the LHD is a different movement, incurring added cost. 

What shameful, dishonest, and profiteering bollox.

Hugh Rice, Hull, thoroughly recommended. They carry the full Tudor line, among others. I've bought Omega (PO), Tudor (Pelly) and Rolex (Exp II) there, no connection to the business other than this.",18,1738426952.0,Tudor,6,1.0,False
1if9uzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1if9uzz/and_i_stayed_dreaming_a_short_story_i_think_some/,"""And I Stayed Dreaming,"" A short story I think some of you may relate to.","Sam and I sat at Brandt’s Coffee, the local caffeine bar. It was our third date, I had asked Sam to pick the spot, and she jumped for Brandt’s. So, come November 7th, we meet at Brandt’s. I’m not much of a coffee drinker, really; maybe as a treat once or twice a year.

“Can I be honest with you, Sam?” I looked up after taking my first few sips of the coffee. Spying Sam’s soft hazel eyes; her blonde, curly hair formed a mane that framed her round face. She was beautiful, to the point where I found myself glancing up at her every few moments, just to remind me about how lucky I am.

“Yeah? Don’t like it?” Sam’s face was knowing, I must’ve made a face or something.

“It’s thick! It tastes and feels like watered-down honey! Coffee doesn’t do that, Sam,” I leaned in conspiratorially, “are you trying to *poison* me, Sam?” I feel as my face contorts into an exaggerated visage of fear.

Sam giggled, “Well, Mr. Picky, if you hate it so much don’t drink it. I’m sorry your palette has been ruined by Shitbucks,” she smugly started sipping her coffee. Her laugh had made my insides melt, then re-solidify. It felt as if I had crystals in my kidneys as I tried to maintain a semblance of homeostasis in her presence.

“I know I’ve told you this, but your laugh is amazing. There’s something about it that I can’t place, it just feels…” a pause, someone had loudly opened the coffee shop’s door, allowing the freezing cold to bleed in. Despite being in a sweater, I felt my blood freeze.

Before I could regain my thoughts, Sam spoke, “Hey, I finished my coffee, we should head out! Wanna come hang at my place?”

\---

Sam and I were dancing together. It had been a year, or a few, and now we lived together in an apartment. It was November 7th, and we had just unpacked the massive amount of three boxes. We celebrate with wine (apple juice for me, not much into alcohol) and a bit of music.

“What song is this, Sam?” We did our best to slow-dance, but we both had no idea what we were doing. Still, I was happy, I had Sam holding me, and I holding her. Her head rested on my shoulder, her hair was straight and brown now, she must’ve changed it recently. I inhaled the smell of her shampoo, it reminded me of wet park dew in the morning.

“I have no clue, Spotify must be shuffling weird shit into our playlists,” Sam said, with an oddly aggressive tone. The song *was* weird, but not horrid. It had a steady tone in the background: *beep, beep, beep.* The lyrics were near-imperceptible, like a man was speaking far away. Otherwise, the song was impenetrable, no beat nor rhythm can be discerned. I found it disgustingly artistic.

“I don’t know, it’s kinda…” I stopped speaking, the window was open. *Who opened that? Why is it so bright out?* A cold breeze flew in, as if on queue. I held Sam closer, trying to share body warmth as the flood of cold hit me.

Sam closed the window, “I must’ve left it open, my bad,” Sam walked back over to me, wrapping her arms around my neck, “Now, we should probably set up that bed, unless you wanna be sleeping on the floor.”

\---

Sam and I sat in a laundry room, *our* laundry room. A decade or such has passed, and Sam and I finally scrounged the cash to get a home. Unlike our younger selves, we had unpacked as quickly as possible; no dancing or alcohol for these responsible adults on the night of November 7th. We were tired, and decided to get some clothes in the wash. We realized something had made them smell unpleasant while we unpacked, like puke.

Sam’s short black hair was soft as I ran my fingers through it, her arms were wrapped around me, an odd position indeed. I stared into her cutting blue eyes, getting lost in the ocean of her irises, nearly sinking in the whirlpool of her pupils.

“I still don’t know what could’ve made our clothes smell like that! Something must’ve died or something,” I postured aloud, not really caring about the inconvenience, but simply making conversation.

“It’s nothing, I don’t know why you’re so worried about it,” Sam replied curtly.

The look I gave her must’ve been powerfully sorrowful, her eyes widened quickly, and she stammered a response.

“H-hey! Sorry about that, didn’t mean for that to come out like… that,”

“Are you okay, Sam? You seem a bit tense,” I ran a caring hand across her cheek, attempting to soothe her.

“I-I’m fine,” she glanced around, ignoring my caress, searching for something I never could discern.

“Alright, you’ve just been acting a bit…” I was interrupted as the air conditioning kicked on, loudly proclaiming its life. Cold air flooded the room, much colder than any AC has the right to be. My body started to tremble uncontrollably.

We were in the kitchen, Sam and I probably left the cold laundry room, “Come on, let’s eat some dinner before it gets late.”

\---

Sam and I were arguing in the living room. It’s been a while, we’ve found a new home. A vase shattered a few feet from my head. Sam’s beautiful face, topped with short, curly blonde hair, had mutated into a hateful mask.

“GET OUT! You need to leave!” Sam was screaming, her green eyes stabbing daggers into my heart, “This isn’t right! We shouldn’t be here!”

I was perplexed, what had I done wrong? “Sam, what are you talking about?”

“You haven’t noticed? Of course you fucking haven’t,” Sam shook her head vigorously, as if trying to release someone’s grip from her face.

“Sam, please, tell me what’s wrong.”

“What day is it?”

“What? Sam-”

“What. Fucking. Day. Is. IT!?”

“November 7th… why does that matter?” my mind dug deep into itself, searching for a meaning.

Sam looked around, searching for nothing, nothing at all. Then she found nothing. She strode to our front door. “Now you’ll see!” Sam threw open our front door.

Blinding white, what was a simple suburb has morphed into an impossibly white landscape. Thousands of sensations flooded in from that door. The first was the taste, a saline taste infected my throat, hiding under it a sweet tang of…

Then the voices came, they were distant, but they were accompanied with a steady *beep, beep, beep*…

Finally, the freezing wind grabbed my ankles, I started to shake, my body convulsing as I was pulled to the ground. I gripped the banister of the stairs, gripping them for dear life.

“Sam, please! Close the door!”

Sam’s face had changed, it was now a cavernous maw of regret and sadness, “I can’t, you need to wake up one day, you can’t keep living like this.”

“No! I want to be here! I want to be with you.”

“You had dreams! You had plans! You can’t throw them away.” I felt as my grip was weakening, the voices were growing louder, the taste was causing me to retch. My temples were being crushed by cinder blocks, the sky was screaming.

“P-please! I don’t care about them! It *hurts* out there! There isn’t anything there for me.”

“Family? Friends? You’re lying to yourself.”

“I’d throw it all away to stay here.” One hand lost grip, I was desperate, I felt my nails dig deep into the wood. The wood bowed, threatening to shatter in my grip. Objects scattered around our house started to fly past me into the white void.

Sam’s eyes softened to a hazel, “Are you being honest? You would give that all up for… this?”

My mouth was filled with bile, I couldn’t speak. So I nodded vigorously.

With a sigh, Sam effortlessly closed the door. The windows displayed our neighbor’s homes again; a red car passed.

The tastes, the noises, the feelings: they were all gone. I stood up and ran to Sam, gripping her tightly. “Never again, please. Never, ever, ever, ever…” Tears formed in my eyes, I held her as tightly as I could. My head wouldn’t stop shaking, denying the truths I never saw.

Sam wrapped her arms around me, “Never again, we’ll stay here, forever.”

And I stayed dreaming.

\---

“It’s been two weeks, why isn’t he awake yet?” Bob looked down at his comatose friend, “you said it would be a week, at most.” The heart rate monitor steadily beeped, the nurse had just cleaned out his neck IV with some saline, and hurried away.

The doctor bit his knuckle, trying to think of a good excuse, “He drank a lot of the Glycol, we can’t exactly tell what will happen. Only guess.”

“You’re saying he might be like this forever?” Reba stood up, she had been in the room all day, waiting for her nephew to finally wake up. This had become her recent daily job, sitting there, silently waiting for those eyes to flit open.

“We’re saying we don’t know, Mrs. Bach, the dialysis got rid of most of the Glycol in his blood, but with how long he was out there in the park, we can’t tell how he is mentally.”

Reba sat back down, tears starting to form in her eyes. Bob already had a stream forming on his cheeks.

“We’ve tried to wake him up, we tried some drugs, we’re looking into bringing some neurostimulants. It’s like he’s resisting the call to wake up.”

Reba sobbed, Bob grabbed his friend's hand, feeling the deathly chill of it.

🌀 **The Easiest Path Will Become The System**  
No planning, no forcing, just **lean into whatever your brain is already doing.** If you always end up drying laundry on your chair instead of the drying rack, guess what? Your chair *is* the drying rack now

💨 **Momentum Beats Willpower**  
Goblin systems don't require discipline. They require cleverly placed tripwires that turn one task into another before you can protest. *If breakfast leads to vacuuming, then vacuuming was the next logical step in the system all along*

🔄 **If It Happens Twice, It's a Feature**  
Once is an accident; twice is a pattern; three times and you accidentally invented a whole workflow. If your morning routine now includes cleaning the bathroom mirror because you're already standing there brushing your teeth, congrats: *you've been upgraded*

🔧 **Fixing Things Takes Too Much Work. Just Work Around Them**  
Traditional engineering is about solving problems. **Goblin Engineering is about learning to live with them in the most efficient way possible.** Is your broken lamp now a highly specific shelf? Does your floor have a designated ""pile zone"" instead of a storage system? *That's just structural adaptation, baby*

🚧 **Artificial Brakes Are a Scam**  
If something requires *effortful stopping,* it's probably unnatural. The goblin brain doesn't run on hard stops; it runs on **environmental nudges and momentum shifts.** If you're trying to pause a thing manually, you need to *redirect it, not fight it*

---

### **Goblin Engineering in the Wild**  
- **Started making coffee; now the whole kitchen is clean?** ✔️ That's a goblin feedback loop  
- **Made a to-do list; ignored it completely; but still ended up doing half the tasks?** ✔️ That's just **organic prioritization**  
- **Built an automation so that you *never* have to do a task manually again?** ✔️ Peak goblin efficiency  
- **A system broke, so instead of fixing it, you just adapted around it?** ✔️ *That's called ecosystem resilience*

---

Goblin Engineering doesn't need *maintenance, discipline, or effort.* It just needs **a nudge and some momentum.** If your life has ever started organizing itself *without your permission,* you may already be an accomplished Goblin Engineer

5, 10” 
34 yrs old 
Male 

I’ve been overweight and yo-yoing my whole life.
July 6, 2024 I was 270 lbs. The last 2.5 years I have been getting the gym hard everyday. I discovered strict keto (meat, nuts, veggies, coffee) mixed with repeated extended fasting (any where from 5-10 days) in 6 months i dropped 70 lbs to 200 lbs. I was looking the best (or leanest for that matter) I’ve ever looked (despite possibly losing muscle mass?) 

I discovered carnivore and realized it was similar to feeling you get from extended fasting… except you get to eat as much meat as you want.

Flash forward to today. I’m 65 days in on strict carnivore (beef, eggs, butter, water, no coffee, or alcohol) and I’ve gained 15 lbs. Surely a lot of the weight is muscle mass, but I’m getting worried I’ll just put back on the weight like I have my entire life and continue the cycle. 

I probably eat 2-3 lbs of beef a day and eggs here and there. I’ve been doing OMAD. I could eat 4-6 lbs a day if I ate throughout the day.

Ive heard Chaffee say eating more might actually train your metabolism to where you want it and then the weight will come off. It’s hard to imagine eating 5 or 6 lbs of fatty beef a day will make me lose weight.. but im willing to try it if it truly is what I should do, but it’s terrifying if I’m wrong. I can’t go back to the weight I was.

Thanks in advance for everyone’s input!!

1if9ree,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSTR/comments/1if9ree/bitcoin_game_theory_mstr_front_running/,"Bitcoin, Game Theory, MSTR, Front Running, Institutional Shift","TLDR: Here are talking points in a format that can be used to help spread awareness and dispel FUD, or, how I spend my Saturday mornings.

Most people misunderstand Bitcoin because they still think about it as a replacement for cash—something you'd use to buy coffee or groceries. That might be part of its future, but right now, the real game is happening at a much higher level: **institutional adoption.**

# Game Theory & Bitcoin: The Bigger Picture

Game theory helps explain **why** major players are starting to position themselves around Bitcoin today. In any competitive system—whether it’s markets, geopolitics, or even biological evolution—actors make strategic decisions based on what others are doing. In Bitcoin’s case, early institutional movers are recognizing that **waiting too long means paying a higher price later**—or worse, being left behind entirely.

This is why MicroStrategy (MSTR) continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. They’re increasing the probability of global adoption by forcing other institutions to consider their own Bitcoin strategy. If you're a large company or nation-state watching this unfold, you face a choice:

1. **Act early** and gain an advantage.
2. **Ignore it** and risk getting priced out later.

This is a classic **coordination problem**—if enough large players move in, Bitcoin's role as a global financial asset becomes inevitable. The first movers gain the most, while those who hesitate will be forced to join at much higher costs.

# What Is Front-Running & Why It Matters for Emerging Tech

Front-running traditionally refers to a trader or institution **making a move ahead of others based on privileged information.** In traditional finance, this might involve high-frequency trading.

In emerging tech, front-running takes a different form. It means **understanding a paradigm shift before the masses do and positioning accordingly.** Most of the world still doesn't fully grasp Bitcoin's macro role, so the ""pool of capital"" available to front-run remains relatively small. Additionally, access is still relatively limited and prohibitive (but this is changing).

Right now, front-running Bitcoin adoption is limited by **the close-mindedness of those who still think about it as a payments system instead of a monetary base layer.** That’s why large institutions are slowly accumulating rather than going all in—most of their competitors haven’t even realized they need to play this game yet.

# Bitcoin as an Institutional Settlement Layer

This cannot be stressed enough right now: the shift we’re seeing isn’t about Bitcoin being used for coffee transactions—it’s about it becoming a **settlement layer for large-scale institutional transactions.** Central banks, hedge funds, multinational corporations—these are the players that will drive the next phase of adoption.

1if9q9l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1if9q9l,Living Room Decoration Plan,"Hi r/interiordecorating, lurker here who would appreciate some outside perspective on our own home.  We bought this 1960s house last year and are slowly piecing together our plans for it.  This is the main living room.  The couch, chair, and rug are new and bought with this room in mind.  The bookshelf and floor lamp are holdovers from our old home that will likely be moved to other parts of the house.  

The room is *nowhere near done* but there are a more plans underway.  The wall behind the TV is going to be dark walnut acoustic slats (https://www.luxewall.com/collections/acoustic-slat-walling/products/dark-walnut-acoustic-slat-109-panels), with the tv mounted and cords hidden behind the wall.  We have a ton of large art getting framed for the wall behind the couch, so worry not—that will not be bare!

Finally, to my questions: 
 
- Where the heck should we put lighting?  This room gets awesome natural light in the day, but it does not have any overhead lighting so as of now, the floor lamp is all we got.  I was thinking of buying one of the Nelson cigar lamps (https://store.hermanmiller.com/lighting-floor-lamps/nelson-cigar-lotus-floor-lamp-walnut/4359-2.html?lang=en_US) but don’t know where to put it? 

- Where can we put tables that could house table lamps or anything else?  Unfortunately there’s too small a gap between the armchair and french door to put anything there.  In lieu of a coffee table, we’re considering getting an ottoman “tray” of sorts like this: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1574057037/the-ansley-ottoman-table-handmade-in?ref=cart

- Should we get a window treatment for the window shown here or the French doors to the deck?  I admit window does look bare, but it’s so nice to have an unimpeded view outside. 

Any other thoughts are welcome! ",3,1738426571.0,interiordecorating,2,1.0,False

She is going to buy an extension cord so that she can keep her toaster, coffee maker, and frother(?) all plugged in constantly, rather than just unplugging one device she isn't using and plugging in the one she is using? I'm genuinely so confused about her reasoning for this. Is it because she is addicted to buying things and creating as much waste as possible (as evidenced by the insane amount of shit she showcased throughout this entire video)? Or is she just so entitled and spoiled that she simply could not be forced to endure having to move/unplug something (the horror!) or wait a couple of minutes to use a different appliance?",0,1738426438.0,TarTarSnark,19,0.33,False

Whats the process of going to a cafe ? 
Can you just sit anywhere or is it best to ask for a table ?
After getting a table do u leave your things there & then order at the counter ? And do you wait at the counter for the drink or do they bring it to you ?
I know it might be a silly question, but unfortunately not knowing the “process” has made me too afraid to try a cafe here so far, so thanks in advance !",4,1738426434.0,hanoi,13,0.7,False
