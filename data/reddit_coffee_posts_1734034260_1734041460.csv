Looking for an easy way to make frothy drinks at home? I recently tried out the Anteday Milk Frother and was impressed by its performance.

This handheld electric whisk is perfect for creating foamy milk for lattes, cappuccinos, and other coffee drinks. I found it simple to use - just press a button and the powerful motor whips up froth in seconds. The compact size fits nicely in my kitchen drawer too.

I liked that it works well with different types of milk. The frother also comes in handy for mixing up hot cocoa, matcha tea, and even whisking eggs. Clean-up is quick - I just run it under water and turn it on briefly.

While it's not quite as powerful as professional machines, this frother gets the job done for home use. The battery-powered design is convenient, though you'll need to replace batteries over time.

# Bottom Line

The Anteday Milk Frother is a great pick for making frothy drinks at home. Its easy operation and compact size make it a useful kitchen gadget.



# Milk Frother Overview: Transform Your Home Into a Cafe

I recently got my hands on this nifty little milk frother, and it's been a game-changer for my morning routine. The small blue device packs a punch with its 10,000 RPM motor. I've been whipping up lattes, cappuccinos, and even matcha green tea with ease. It's super simple to use - just press a button and watch the magic happen.

The frother works well with different types of milk. I've tried it with regular, almond, and oat milk. Clean-up is a breeze too. I just run it under water and give it a quick spin.

One thing to note: while it's great for drinks, it's not the best for beating eggs. I tried it once, and the results were just okay.

The compact size is a plus. It fits nicely in my kitchen drawer. For the price, it's a solid choice for home baristas. It won't replace a coffee shop, but it definitely ups my at-home coffee game.

# Powerful 10,000 RPM Motor: Quick Frothing Action

I was impressed by the speed of this frother. The 10,000 RPM motor packs a punch, creating foam in seconds. I found it easy to whip up creamy froth for my morning latte. The motor is strong enough to handle both cold and hot milk.

While it's powerful, the frother stays quiet. I could use it early without waking anyone up. The quick action saves time when I'm in a rush.

One downside is the motor can drain batteries fast with heavy use. But for occasional frothing, it works great. The speed makes it versatile for other drinks too. I've used it to mix protein shakes and blend bulletproof coffee.

# Versatile Drink Maker: Beyond Just Milk

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I could do with this little frother. It's not just for milk! I've used it to whip up some tasty matcha green tea lattes and even mix my protein shakes. The powerful motor makes quick work of blending drinks. I found it great for making cold foam for iced coffee too. It's easy to switch between hot and cold drinks.

One thing I liked was using it to mix hot cocoa. No more clumps of powder at the bottom of my mug. The frother dissolved everything smoothly. I also tried it for whisking a single egg for breakfast. It worked okay, but I wouldn't count on it for larger batches.

Clean-up is a breeze. I just run it under water and give it a quick spin. The compact size means it doesn't take up much space in my drawer. While it's not perfect for everything, I've found it to be a handy tool for many of my favorite drinks.

# Easy Operation and Maintenance: Convenience at its Best

I found this milk frother super simple to use. Just press the button and it's ready to go. Cleaning is a breeze too. I just run it under water and turn it on briefly. The handle wipes clean with a damp cloth. Storage is no hassle - it's small enough to fit in my kitchen drawer without taking up much space. I love how quick and easy it is to make frothy drinks at home now. The compact size and straightforward design make it perfect for everyday use. It's become a handy tool in my kitchen routine.

# Compact Size: Ideal for Every Kitchen

I love how this little frother fits perfectly in my kitchen drawer. It's so small and lightweight that I can easily tuck it away when not in use. The slim design means it doesn't take up much space at all. I've found it's great for apartments or small kitchens where counter space is limited. Even in a crowded drawer, I can always find room for this handy tool. Its portability is a big plus too - I've taken it on trips to froth milk in hotel rooms. The compact size doesn't compromise its power though. It still whips up foam quickly and effectively despite being so tiny.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this milk frother for a while now, and it's become a staple in my kitchen. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Powerful motor: The 10,000 RPM motor froths milk quickly and efficiently.
* Versatile: I've used it for various drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and even matcha.
* Easy to use: The one-button operation is simple and straightforward.
* Portable: Its compact size fits nicely in my kitchen drawer.
* Easy to clean: I can rinse it under running water and wipe the handle with a damp cloth.
* Good for more than milk: It works well for mixing hot cocoa and protein shakes too.

# Cons

* Button needs constant pressure: I have to hold the button down while using it.
* Not ideal for eggs: It struggles with beating multiple eggs at once.
* Durability concerns: Some users reported it stopped working after a short time.
* Noise level: While not extremely loud, it's not the quietest kitchen tool.
* Limited use for thick mixtures: It's best for liquids and light foams.

The Anteday frother is a handy tool for coffee lovers who want to make cafe-style drinks at home. It's fast, easy to use, and creates nice foam for various beverages. But it's not perfect for every kitchen task, and there are some worries about how long it lasts. For the price, though, it's a good option if you mainly want it for frothing milk and mixing drinks.

# Customer Reviews: Real Opinions From Verified Buyers

I checked out what buyers had to say about this milk frother. Many users liked how well it works for drinks. One person said it made great whipped cream fast. Another used it for a pumpkin frappe and was happy with the results. The frother seems to do a good job with coffee, hot cocoa, and protein shakes.

Some people found it easy to use and clean. The long wand helps keep the motor dry. A few noted it's pretty powerful for its small size.

Not everyone was totally satisfied though. One user said it wasn't strong enough for eggs. Another reported it stopped working after just a few uses.

Overall, most buyers seem pleased with this frother for making foamy drinks at home. It's not perfect, but many find it useful for their daily coffee or smoothie routines.

# Lifetime Warranty: Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed

I was impressed by Anteday's commitment to their customers. The milk frother comes with a lifetime warranty, which gave me peace of mind when I bought it. If any problems come up, I can contact them for help. They seem eager to make sure I'm happy with my purchase. This kind of support is rare for a small kitchen gadget. It shows the company believes in their product. I feel confident using my frother knowing I can get assistance if needed. The warranty adds value to an already useful tool.

# Conclusion

I'm really impressed with this milk frother. It's a handy little tool that's become part of my daily routine. The strong motor whips up creamy foam quickly and quietly. It's great for lattes, protein shakes, and even whipped cream. Clean-up is a breeze too. While it struggles a bit with larger tasks like beating multiple eggs, that's not its main purpose. The portable design and easy-to-use button make it convenient for home or travel. Despite a few reports of durability issues, my experience has been positive. For the price, this frother offers good value for anyone looking to enhance their beverages with a touch of frothy goodness.",1,1734041409.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

Almost always, savings resemble the effort of putting water into a bucket using just a teaspoon. You are trying hard yet you see little or no progress; sometimes progress may seem very slow. That’s because most people stick to the same old advice: give up your morning coffee, cut down on restaurant meals, and everything in between. That being said, it is time to move on to the other, more exotic aspects, of money-saving tips that work best if you want to get a fast solution.

I am 33 33-year-old male, who was just diagnosed with ADHD-C (Combined type). Now I understand why my life looks like it looks - DISASTER. No real career, no long-term hobbies/passions, no real friends. I always thought that I was just a lazy guy with hundreds of ""one-week interests"" but now I know that undiagnosed ADHD destroyed me and my life, my future...

Everything built so much that a year ago I was diagnosed with severe depression. I am already on a second drug - dulo xetine SNRI. The first one SSRI Escitalopram didn't help at all.

In my opinion, I am depressed because of my back pain problems and also because of the belief that I am a loser ( my life is ""destroyed"" with ADHD). I can't repair my life how I want, and I think it is mostly because of lack of motivation, attention problems, overthinking etc

I asked my psychiatrist about treatment for ADHD, and she replied that it is dangerous to treat depression while being depressed. Well, okay...

So now I am on SNRI, having therapy on which the doctor is preaching to me that I need to break ""the circle"" and I know NOW that the circle is caused by ADHD.

I tried some things like 852 Hz frequency which is helping me a little bit of calming my brain.  
I started drinking coffee but I do not see any consequences of caffeine (just more toilet visits)

(Also the original title was how do i understand and stuff but the automod didnt like that)

Weve dated for 5 months after meeting in a coffee shop. Ive done some things in the past and only stopped it recently because i was motivated by her to be a law abiding citizen, but i had and still have big plans that was a point of contention in our relationship. 

Around a week before thanksgiving i sent her a note of my grievences because i was unhappy with some things and reading all that made her rethink everything up to that point. We took some space for a week while she gathered her thoughts.

The day we decided to talk again we had a really long talk and during her space she came to the conclusion that we should break up because of some of my ambitions and wants and stuff, but the main reason was that she didnt want a relationship with anyone. She feels like she loses herself in one and that she cant grow if shes in one. 

I convinced her to stay to try until the new year to see if her positive feelings of our relationship outweighed the negative feelings of not wanting to be in a relationship and for the next 2 weeks weve enjoyed each others time and discussed and mostly rwsolved the other 2 problems because i thought those were the main problems.

Only today did i realize that the main problem was her just not wanting a relationship. We talked a lot and its basically like, she loves me, she loves what we have, and she doesnt want to lose me. Shes fine with kissing shes fine with the sex shes fine with cuddling etc, its just that the title of being in a relationship, and the expectations associated with it she dislikes.

Ive talking with her to try to find ig a compromise but i dont know what to do anymore and she encouraged me to post here if i felt like it.

I guess im looking for advice or new perspectives. If you have any thoughts on why this might be, what i should ask her, topics i should bring up, solutions maybe, or anything at all.

Ill answer any questions i get too because i really love this girl, like no other i have before, she makes me happy beyond words i have available to me and i want nothing less than to spend my life with her.

Anything and everything is appreciated

I’m an expectant father, excitedly awaiting the arrival of our second child, and I’m looking to connect with other men in a similar situation. Whether you’re about to become a dad for the first time or are expecting another, it’d be great to meet, share experiences, and support each other through this exciting stage of life.

I’d really appreciate the chance to enjoy some social activities like going for a walk or grabbing a coffee to chat about life in general, and fatherhood in particular. At the same time, I’d love to find a partner for light fitness activities like running, swimming, or even relaxing in the sauna afterward. Nothing overly intense—just a way to stay active and unwind while enjoying some good conversation.

I’m based in Vesterbro, close to Frederiksberg, so it’d be ideal to connect with others nearby. If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, drop me a message, and we’ll figure out a time and place to meet.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

","Today the Lindumbs are doubling down on their attempts to gaslight us into believing Caspergers can speak. They've taken a break from stuffing Greggs sausage rolls in his mouth to shove words in there instead. No he absolutely didn't say <insert word here>. Why do the brainless believe they can brainwash us so? Carol Gobderman barks out numbers for the kiddo to find on an advent calendar. Unsurprisingly, he can't find his arse with both hands. He literally cannot speak, you oafs.. what makes you think he knows what numbers are?! Disappointed Dad Dim (who is ""guh'id"" - that's 'gutted' to those of us with qualifications) even points out that FP is just closing his eyes and dissociating. I would too if I had Gobdilocks in my ear holes bleating ""Not that one, not that one, not that one"". 

Dim orders Gobby off to get his advent calendar too. No please, no thank you. This man is a pig, but he's certainly not welcome in The Oink Oink Crew. 

Apparently AmLegs is not like other children and ""wouldn't eat chocolate even if he could"". Well call me Mystic Meg gang, because I see starvation in this kid's future. Chocolate is one of the Lindumbs' five a day. Dim then coughs right in the poor boy's face... If the malnutrition doesn't get him, the Dimbonic plague will. 

We're back on the weather chat again. This woman is so fucking boring I don't even think my ADHD meds can stop me from going comatose listening to her. She's complaining about debris in the road after the storm, which apparently pops into existence out of thin air before she has time to break..... Again I find myself saying ""Maybe if you were looking at the road rather than rubber necking at Christmas lights you'd have seen it Gobshite"".

The power is off in The Shite House, and we're in a state of uncaffeinated emergency. ""What do people have when they can't drink tea or coffee?!"", cries Ms Starbuck herself. Even Dim doesn't know - ""orange juice"", he purports. These two make me feel like I'm being waterboarded... I suppose that would be coffeeboarded to them.

Poor wee Smidge is minding his own business on the kitchen table.. Presumably to get out of 'Bubump's' clammy reach. ""ARE YOU OK SMIDGE?!"" roars Andrew Lloyd Gobber, with levels of feline disrespect not seen since someone decided James Cordon was a good casting move for Cats in 2019.

Fumpeeeez is invited to pick which cereal he wants (he slaps both boxes continuously), and Gobsburys regales us with the merits of store-brand fruit and fibre... But she makes sure we know that she is definitely not sponsored by Tesco! Beam me up Gobby, what planet are you living on to think Tesco would want to sponsor you 😂. Her and Dim really think they're somebodies don't they. The only thing they're a good advert for is contraception. Not that they need it with Dim's dopey swimmers (`Dimmers`?). 

We're out at Costa now.. of course we are - Goblin has those souls from her weekend rituals to cash in, doesn't she! Dainty Dim is wearing a woman's jacket, and not a very flattering one at that. Doesn't the fashionista know that double breasted numbers aren't flattering if you live off a diet as beige as his coat?

Our Lord FunPeas was whisked off to a Christmas party. He met Santa, who I hoped he might confront about the commercialisation of crimbo and the diversion from the Peastian history of the holiday. Alas, he avoids eye contact and tries to crawl inside Dimberly's skin 👀... I think I smell some neurodivergence here. 

The Dimbles are hosting this year's G3 summit at the manor, with some of Great Yarmouth's finest minds debating the big issues of today's society, such as ""Do u sey San'a or Fahvur Crismus?"", and "" 'ow do u spel vallyuhnt?"". Just Stop Oil's latest initiate, Greta Fumpberg, has thrown himself face down on the floor protesting the astronomical number of braincells wasted in powering this conference. Gobzilla admits that those in attendance are ""not that smart""... Ladies and germs, I believe she might be gaining sentience.

After a hell lot of research from reddit and online sources, these are the thing I started doing that cured my severe itch :


- Stop eating sugars STRICTLY. They feed the fungus and helps them grow. (This is one of the major reasons for my cure)

- Eat healthy, no junks and try to not skip any meal, especially breakfast. Also try consuming fish oil capsules or any kind of immunity development thing.

- After showers, completely dry out the affected area, there should no water. Trim out the hair in the affected area if any as they trap moisture.

- Once done, use a dusting powder and apply it to the area if you are going out or to work.

For athelete's foot,

- Take a spray bottle (you can get it from plastic stores nearby). Fill it's 1/2 with vinegar and other half with Listerine.

- spray on the affected area daily and let it dry. Then apply dusting powder. Wash off when you go to shower later or better to let it dry and wash it off in the morning.

For jock itch,

- I used a combination of zalim lotion, itch guard and ketacozanole.

Btw keep a seperate towel to dry the affected area and wash it often with hot water.

Continue doing this for atleast a month and thank me later.

The main thing is completely cut off sugars. Don't even drink coffee or any shit that might contain sugar.

Also try using povidone iodine before applying the recommended lotions and creams before sleep and wash it off in the morning.",1,1734040812.0,DermatologyQuestions,1,0.99,False

I talked to multiple specialists and did everything I found recommended online and I saw basically no improvement, but two days ago I met with a genius at the Apple Store who gave me advice that seems to have actually worked that I wanted to share.

He went into the Siri settings and then to Apps, and then went into each individual app one by one and disabled “Learn from this App”. Apparently this is a new feature of apple intelligence where Siri monitors and learns from your activity on different apps to be able to give suggestions. The example he gave me was, if you have the Starbucks app (which I don’t but that’s neither here nor there) and you go and order the same coffee and the same time every day, Siri will “learn” that and start to prompt you when you’re near a Starbucks to see if you want to place your standard order or whatever.

I don’t use Siri much besides telling it to make phone calls so I had no problem turning off the learning feature for all of my apps. And since doing that for the past few days my battery life has improved very significantly, it’s now behaving basically like what I would expect from a new phone.

If you dislike public toilets for their filth and lack of privacy, consider using disabled toilets instead. They’re often much cleaner as they are seldom used, more spacious, and creepy dude free! 

In the UK, these toilets are typically locked, but the good news is that they all use a universal key system. You can purchase a RADAR key online for just a few pounds from eBay etc, giving you instant access nationwide. 

I have a job that requires a lot of travel and time spent out and about, which means public toilets in coffee shops, restaurants, and supermarkets often double as my workplace bathroom. Unfortunately, these are often unpleasant at best. Last year, I invested in a RADAR key, and it’s been an absolute game-changer—clean, spacious, and far more comfortable. Truly, luxury toileting!

15 Tips for First-Time Travelers:

1. Suica Card - A digital card that you can add to your Apple wallet
Mainly used for public transportation, but can be used at vending machines and convenience stores (konbinis) too
Add yen as necessary via Apple Pay with no fee. Start with 2,000 yen and see how it goes.
For public transport, you just hold your phone over the scanner as you enter, then again when you exit. That’s when you’re charged.
You do not need to pull it up on your phone. You do need your own, you can’t share one.

2. Use Google Maps. It was easy to follow for over 90% of the time. It’s also great for finding public restrooms.

3. The Tokyo station Shinkansen (bullet train) is about a 5-minute walk north of where Google Maps says to go. It’s in a large glass building that houses the Four Seasons Hotel. 

4. Use Google Translate to scan menus and items. It can also be used to have a conversation in real-time with someone who doesn’t speak English.

5. The calculator app on your iPhone has a “Conversion” mode that I used countless times to check prices. Very helpful for keeping a budget.

6. Use an eSim for internet access. Download Ubigi and buy a package for Japan. You can find a referral code for 20% off if you search on Reddit. You can activate it the day before you leave. For an iPhone, in settings, go to cellular. When you land, turn off your Cellular Data and turn on the Ubiji one. Turn OFF “Allow Cellular Data Switching”. I got the 10GB for 30 days package. I ended up using 8GB in 10 days. It ran up to almost 5GB after the first 2 days because photos were syncing to the cloud. In that same settings page, you can turn off cellular data for certain apps. Make sure to turn it off for photos. Using Google Maps, translate, chrome barely used any data.

7. Once you know when you want to take a train, book it! You can get a discount on “Green Car” Shinkansen (a more spacious car on the train) for booking a few days out. You’ll also ensure that you can sit next to your travel partner(s).

8. Book Shinkansens through the smartEX App. You can connect your Suica card to it for easy entry and exit at the stations. You should do this. If you don’t, you’ll have to pull up a QR code and when you try to scan it, your Suica card will pop up by default. You’ll have to ask the attendants to help you.

9. Train station attendants are great and super helpful. They helped me when my scan wasn’t working and pointed me in the right direction. Some may not speak English so have your google translate ready to go.

10. The GO app was great for taxis. It works exactly like Uber. I walked as much as possible, took public transit when I needed to, and only took taxis twice. Once from my Kyoto hotel to Arashiyama, then another time to make it to a store before it closed.

11. ChatGPT can be your pocket travel agent. It’s definitely not perfect, though. Ask for suggestions, do some quick research on your own, and then decide.

12. Walk on the left side, usually. There will be areas where the flow switches. Just keep an eye out for arrows on the ground and follow what everyone else is doing. Sidewalks are a bit more ambiguous. It seems sides get tossed aside when it’s busy.

13. Learn some Japanese! It’s rewarding and 99% of the time, it’s appreciated. I printed out a cheat sheet of basic phrases, and by the end of the trip, I was able to use them all without looking them up.

14. If someone in Japan speaks English well, tell them! They will deeply appreciate it.

15. I took this trip with my wife. Our favorite moments were the unexpected ones while walking from one place on the itinerary to another. Taking the time to walk through small neighborhoods and admire the homes, pop into a coffee shop, or watch a group of kids laugh with each other as they walk home from school was absolutely worth the steps. Those were authentic experiences.

Japan was truly wonderful to us. We loved the culture, the food, the transit, the bathrooms (even public ones), and of course the people. If I had to describe the people in one word, it would be considerate. 

This was our honeymoon. We saved 10K for it.
We used Hyatt points for the Tokyo and Kyoto hotels. Our flights from San Francisco were $1,150 each round trip. The second biggest expense was the hotel in Hakone. It costs about $1,000 for one night. We spent $811 on food, which is amazing to me. I thought it would be more.
The total spent on travel, food, and hotels came out to $5,400, including 40,000 Yen ($290).
I spent $50 on my Suica card and did some shopping. I bought sneakers from New Balance, a jacket at United Arrows, clothes at Uniqlo, a cardholder at Inden-Ya, towels at Imabari, jeans at Mototaro, Beats Pro at Yodobashi, some games at Bic Camera, and a few things at Donquijote.
The grand total for this 10-day trip was about $4,000 per person.

I’m not surprised that I get mistaken for a student, but I am getting slightly fed up with it, especially after an incident that happened today. Let me preface this by saying that I always wear my faculty badge with my building keys around my neck anytime I am in the halls as I need it to scan into different areas of the building, access classrooms, etc. I even dress professional daily (I dress like I work in a corporate office) even though staff has a relaxed dress code, and I can confidently say I dress more professional than the vast majority of the teachers in the district.

Today, as I was leaving the building with the rest of the team I was somewhat aggressively grabbed by the arm by a teacher who thought I was a student and she demanded to see my hall pass (faculty badge still very visible on my person). My co-worker then corrected her as they were right next to me when this occurred. I shook it off and kept walking but boy did it catch me off guard. 

I can normally laugh off being mistaken for a student, but the way she grabbed me was definitely uncalled for and felt almost diminishing?

I've got an estimated 12 week old kitten that we rescued over the road about a month ago. Lots of playful energy, really good at running around and climbing things, overall very agile. But she won't jump more than 6 inches, or at least she won't try. It's been convienent so far as we haven't had to worry about her getting onto our kitchen table or TV stand yet, but now that she's 12 weeks I'm starting to wonder if she'll ever try.

  
She DOES climb, and will climb up on any surface that she can get her claws into. She gets onto the couch and the bed by climbing up the side. She hops up onto only one of our kitchen chairs (the one that has a soft pad that she can sink claws onto and pull herself up).  She has a little kitten scratching post that's 18"" tall, and there's a bed on top that she likes to sleep on. I've watched her dig her claws into sides of the bed and pull herself up with a kitten-chin-up (which looked HARD so I would think she'd jump up if she could). I covered a cardboard box with carpet and put it beside the cat tree to help her get up/down, but she still climbs rather than jumps. 

  
she DOES hop down from things, like the couch and bed, and sometimes tries to jump down from our shoulders (but we dont let her because its too high) so I dont think she's scared of heights. 

and she will NOT get up on any surface that doesn't have traction/ material she can claw. For example, we have a coffee table that sits low to the ground, and she's sat on a box right next to it so that her head was at the coffee table height. She could have easily hopped onto it, but she won't because it's a wood surface so I think she thinks its slippery. 

  
Is this normal kitten development? I was expecting her trying to get up on stuff more by this age. ",2,1734039543.0,CatAdvice,2,1.0,False

Basically I am shitting my pants over here afraid that I am now going to have a roach problem! 
Is this one roach going to cause an infestation???

My house (North Texas):
-I keep the kitchen very clean. No open food, sanitize counters daily, sink and dishes washed multiple times a day. 
-All over very tidy
-vacuum multiple times a week including under furniture (two dogs, three cockatiels in home)
-I have roach poison tablets scattered everywhere because it keeps the giant roaches out during rainy season (I've been doing this for a while and it's kept all the bugs out)

I’m lucky to be diet controlled but as all of you know it’s still hard. Getting enough calories the right way to prevent a spike has taken a lot of planning and energy.

I’ve done my best to keep my chin up and roll with the punches and overall I think I’ve done a pretty good job but I feel like something broke in me today. 

One comfort I’ve been able to keep is one half caf latte every morning. We have a really nice espresso maker and it’s provided some comfort and consistency and doesn’t spike my blood sugar and is a nice way to start the day. I realize this is a luxury and we’re so fortunate to have such a nice machine in the first place. But 3 weeks ago our machine broke. I’ve done my best to cope, while our machine is in shop by either not having coffee or by running to the nearest coffee shop 20 mins away. 

But today I was too tired to get out of bed or eat until 11am, which means I didn’t eat and my whole schedule is off for the day and at one point I broke down and went to the coffee shop but it was only 5 degrees out which was brutal.  And after that I’ve felt too tired to make food, eat or track my blood sugar. I just feel broken, and again I realize that’s dramatic but fuck this is hard and losing the little luxury feels like a blow.

I feel like I need to ask my partner for help or support but I don’t even know what to ask for. We could get a regular coffee maker in the meantime to hold us over but drip coffee upsets my stomach. Do I ask him to help me make food and eat on a schedule? I feel overwhelmed and exhausted and I need help but I’m not even sure what to ask for at this point. What support has been the most helpful for you? How do I do what I need to for my baby when I’m mentally and physically exhausted?",1,1734039206.0,GestationalDiabetes,0,1.0,False

My bosses boss and I made a deal two months ago that they would only require me to open OR close for the two days after Christmas (Thursday and Friday). My direct manager will be out of town and normally it would just be me opening and her closing. Once we open, we can go home right after to work from home and then someone else will come to close. This is how we are doing it for other locations. 
Well….my other boss told me today that I have to open and close since we need to be there in case we get mail, we have a tour, clean coffee machine etc..

The thing is, they already told me I don’t have to open and close. I live 1 hr away from the location which means I’ll have to drive down to open, drive back home, drive back to close, drive back home. That’s 4hrs of driving. I’m better off just staying at the building which isn’t fair because everyone else has two people that can open and close.

Let me first say- sometimes, I do like watching aesthetic vids of other people doing regular day stuff and romanticizing it. I go in and out of phases where I enjoy it, obviously right now I don’t lol. But my gosh, I didn’t watch today or yesterdays because honestly, with her and the other book girlies, I can only listen to someone who is an influencer talk about “romanticizing their life” and “romanticizing a day doing nothing” so many times. 

This is a general point, but one day this trend is going to fall off, and then what will these booktubers do? Go into the “real world”? Or scramble to follow a trend. I’m saying this as someone who spends most days “doing nothing” (I have a really chill job) and sometimes trying to romanticize it, this shit is B O R I N G. Genuinely, it’s a privilege. But also, many of these influencer would benefit from doing engaging things. Taking classes at a community college, taking music lessons, charity, etc. Going back to school actually really helped my mental health to be able to engage in academic topics and not just consume media on my phone and tv. 

It’s good Steph has been able to relax for the last year since graduating. But yeah, if you’re vlogging everyday, how sustainable is it if you’re also doing nothing? How long will viewers, who most likely watch other influencers doing the same, stick around? Sometimes hanging with friends, going to coffee shops, but that’s it? 

Omg I sound like a hater. Sorry. As you can see, I have time “doing nothing” to come on here and post this 💀",3,1734039012.0,stephbohrersnark,0,1.0,False

Bitcoin users, we’ve all been there. You’ve sent a transaction—whether it’s paying for coffee, buying that digital collectible, or transferring funds to your buddy—and then you wait. And wait. And wait some more. Your transaction is stuck in the mempool, waiting for miners to give it the green light. Frustrating, right?

Well, let us introduce you to your new blockchain best friend: **Bitcoin TX Accelerate**! Say goodbye to delays and hello to blazing-fast confirmations. With Bitcoin TX Accelerate, your transactions will jump the queue and hit the blockchain at record speed. Ready to dive into the fast lane? Buckle up, because this is going to be a wild ride!

# Why Transactions Get Stuck in the First Place 🚦

Before we get to the fun part (hint: it’s Bitcoin TX Accelerate), let’s talk about why your transactions sometimes crawl slower than a snail on a lazy Sunday.

Bitcoin transactions are processed by miners, and miners prioritize transactions with higher fees. When the network gets congested—think Black Friday shopping but for Bitcoin—your transaction might sit in the mempool for hours or even days if your fee isn’t competitive. It’s like trying to grab a taxi in the rain when you’re not waving a crisp $100 bill.

For years, I treated writing like an exam I hadn’t studied for, staring at blank pages with the existential dread of a Shakespearean character. But one day, while sipping a questionably strong cup of coffee, I stumbled upon the secret to making peace with the craft: embracing the mess, the monotony, and the magic of the process itself.

  
First, let’s talk about the **blank page**, the cruel nemesis of aspiring scribes everywhere. I used to see it as a demand for perfection, a canvas I wasn’t qualified to sully. Then I realized: *It’s not blank—it’s empty, begging for life.* That mindset shift felt like stepping into a warm bath after a cold day. I stopped trying to write *well* and simply wrote. Typos? Welcome. Clichés? Pull up a chair. Over time, the act of putting down *anything* became less terrifying than putting down *nothing*.

  
Second, I learned that **writing is less about inspiration and more about perspiration** (as cliché as that sounds—don’t judge me). I used to wait for the muse, that elusive, ethereal creature who whispers brilliance in your ear. Spoiler: she rarely shows up on time, and when she does, she’s often tipsy. So, I set a schedule. I wrote when I was tired, bored, or downright grumpy. Some days, the words flowed like melted chocolate; other days, they dribbled out like ketchup from a stubborn bottle. Either way, I wrote.

  
Finally, I fell in love with revision. Oh, revision—once the bane of my existence, now my favorite writing partner. Editing showed me that writing doesn’t have to be perfect the first time—or the fifth. It’s like sculpting: you start with a block of marble (or, let’s be honest, a block of clay), and each draft chips away at the excess until something beautiful emerges.

Now, writing isn’t something I fear—it’s something I chase. I’ve stopped worrying about whether my work is “good enough” and started loving the process of getting there. Also I enjoyed practicing these exercises

1. The ""What If"" Game

Write a list of “What if” questions. Pick one and freewrite for 10 minutes. The sillier, the better.

2. Object Storytelling

Choose a random object near you (a coffee mug, a stapler, a shoe).Imagine its backstory. How did it end up here? What adventures has it been on? Write a short, whimsical tale.

3. Dialogue Only

Write a scene using only dialogue—no descriptions or actions. Example: Two socks argue in the laundry basket about who’s the favorite. This hones your ability to convey character and mood through words alone.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Brightening your smile can have a remarkable impact on your confidence and self-esteem. Many people turn to teeth whitening to enhance their appearance and create a more radiant smile. The transformation that occurs from before and after teeth whitening treatments can be striking, leading to various benefits beyond aesthetics.

### The Science of Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening works by breaking down stains and discoloration on the enamel. This can be achieved through several methods, such as professional dental treatments or at-home kits. Depending on the method used, you may experience different results. However, the primary goal remains the same—to restore your teeth's natural brightness.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Treatments

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method typically uses stronger bleaching agents to achieve noticeable results in just one session. Many people see significant changes immediately after their appointment.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits often contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide in lower concentrations. While they may take longer to show results, they provide a more gradual whitening effect.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These can help remove surface stains over time, but they usually don’t provide dramatic results compared to other methods.

### Before and After Transformations

One of the most compelling aspects of teeth whitening is the transformation that occurs. Many individuals notice a change not only in the color of their teeth but also in how they feel about themselves. Here’s what you can expect before and after a teeth whitening treatment:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### Before Treatment

- **Staining and Discoloration:** Many people struggle with yellow or stained teeth due to coffee, tea, smoking, or aging.
- **Confidence Levels:** Stained teeth can lead to self-consciousness, affecting personal and professional interactions.
- **Dental Health Assessment:** Prior to treatment, it's crucial to consult with a dentist to ensure your teeth and gums are healthy.

#### After Treatment

- **Whiter Teeth:** The most immediate change is the shade of your teeth. Many report a transformation of several shades lighter.
- **Boosted Confidence:** You'll likely feel more confident smiling, leading to increased social interactions and opportunities.
- **Improved Oral Hygiene Habits:** The desire to maintain your new smile often encourages better dental care routines.

### Real-Life Stories of Transformation

Many individuals have shared their positive experiences with teeth whitening. For instance, consider someone who had struggled with discolored teeth due to years of drinking red wine. After a professional whitening session, not only did they notice a significant aesthetic improvement, but they also reported feeling more willing to engage socially and smile freely.

Another story highlights a busy professional who opted for at-home whitening strips. After consistent use, they transformed their appearance just in time for a significant work presentation. The feedback they received was overwhelmingly positive, making them feel empowered in both their personal and professional life.

### Maintaining Your New Smile

To prolong the brightening effects of teeth whitening, it’s essential to adopt certain practices:

- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Keep visiting your dentist for routine cleanings and evaluations.
- **Mind Your Diet:** Reducing the intake of stain-causing foods and beverages can help maintain your results.
- **Use a Straw:** For drinks that can stain, using a straw can minimize contact with your teeth.

Ultimately, the impact of teeth whitening treatments is clear. The before and after transformations can dramatically enhance how you view yourself and how others perceive you. A brighter smile may just be the boost you need in your daily life, making it worth the effort to explore these treatments. Enjoy your journey to a more confident smile!

Natural vs. Professional Teeth Whitening Methods: What to Expect
----------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a dazzling smile, many people wonder about the best methods for teeth whitening. Situated at the crossroads of aesthetics and oral health, teeth whitening has become increasingly popular for both personal and professional reasons. You might be torn between opting for natural teeth whitening remedies or seeking professional treatments. Let’s explore what you can expect from both avenues.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Natural Teeth Whitening Methods

Natural teeth whitening methods are appealing to those who prefer a gentler approach. These methods typically utilize everyday ingredients that can enhance your smile without harsh chemicals. Here’s a look at some popular techniques:

- **Baking Soda:** Mixing baking soda with water forms a paste that can gently scrub away stains. Use it sparingly to avoid damaging your enamel.
- **Activated Charcoal:** This substance can absorb stains. Swishing it around in your mouth can lead to a whiter smile over time. Be cautious, though, as it can be messy.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** A diluted mixture can work as a mild bleach. Use it in moderation to keep your enamel safe.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Its acidity can help in removing stains. However, it’s essential to rinse later to avoid enamel erosion.
- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Crunchy fruits and vegetables can naturally scrub your teeth while providing essential nutrients, making them excellent for dental health.

While natural methods are generally safe, results can vary and may take longer to appear. The effectiveness of these remedies can rely on your initial tooth shade and the types of stains you have.

### Professional Teeth Whitening Methods

For those who want faster and more effective results, professional teeth whitening treatments are the way to go. These procedures are conducted by dental professionals and can yield impressive results. Common methods include:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This is the quickest way to whiten your teeth. Dentists use stronger hydrogen peroxide solutions, often combined with special lights to enhance whitening. You can expect significant results in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Dentists can provide customized trays and whitening gel to use at home. These kits allow you to gradually whiten your teeth over several days or weeks.
- **Laser Whitening:** This method involves applying a whitening agent to your teeth and exposing them to a laser for enhanced results. It’s an advanced technique that offers dramatic improvements.

Professional treatments tend to be more effective than natural methods, often resulting in multiple shades lighter within a single visit. They are particularly beneficial for deep stains and discoloration.

### What to Expect After Treatment

Regardless of the method you choose, understanding what to expect after teeth whitening can help guide your decision. After natural methods, you might notice gradual changes over weeks. This process is gentler on your teeth, but it requires consistency.

On the other hand, professional whitening treatments usually lead to immediate results. However, some people may experience temporary tooth sensitivity as a side effect. If this happens, it typically subsides within a few days. Make sure to follow your dentist's aftercare instructions for optimal results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Considering Your Options

Ultimately, your choice between natural and professional whitening methods should align with your goals, budget, and desired results. If you prefer a quick and dramatic change, professional treatments are likely the better option. Conversely, if you are looking for a cost-effective way and don’t mind slower results, natural methods can work well.

Before committing to any teeth whitening regimen, it’s advisable to consult with your dentist. They can help you understand the best option for your specific dental situation and provide guidance on maintaining your bright smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Remember, consistent oral hygiene practices, including brushing and flossing regularly, will help your teeth remain white, regardless of the method you choose.

Whether you lean towards natural or professional teeth whitening methods, both have their advantages and considerations. Choose what feels right for you, and enjoy the journey to a brighter smile!

### Conclusion

The journey of teeth whitening can lead to remarkable transformations that not only enhance your smile but also boost your confidence. Before and after results often showcase how a brighter, whiter smile can significantly change a person's appearance, making them feel more attractive and self-assured. Whether you choose natural methods like baking soda and activated charcoal or opt for professional treatments such as in-office bleaching or custom trays, the difference can be striking.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Understanding the pros and cons of each method is crucial for informed decision-making. Natural options tend to be gentler on the teeth and don't contain harsh chemicals, making them suitable for those with sensitive gums or enamel. However, professional methods often provide faster and more dramatic results, tailored to your specific dental needs. While natural remedies may take longer to show effects, in-office treatments can brighten your smile in just one visit.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of either approach relies on individual preferences, dental health, and the desired outcome. Assessing your needs, budget, and lifestyle can help you choose the right path. Remember, a brighter smile is often within reach through diligent care and the right whitening technique. Embracing the right approach can empower you to showcase a radiant smile, leaving a lasting impression on everyone you meet. Your journey towards a dazzling smile can start today—are you ready to shine?

I'm only 19, so maybe that makes this behavior more understandable, I don't know. There was a long period of time where I went without taking or stealing or even thinking about it (probably 5th grade-11th grade), but in the last few years I've started taking stuff again (I'll get back to what I mean by again later), at first it was just from stores very periodically, and it stayed that way for a while. And then last year, I had a roommate who I would always chief carts from, and I think I actually stole 2 carts from her throughout the whole year. But since this year, I've been now taking from places that I work. I'm not talking money, I would never take money. I take items, though, things, because it for some reason I don't see that as ""really stealing"" in the moment, even though I know I could definitely get in trouble and fired for what I'm doing. I did this during a summer job I had, I would just take desserts that weren't expired, and it was every so often. But sometimes when I did it, it would get bad, and I would take a lot of desserts (because I also have this issue where I **love** to steal gifts for people, so I was stealing desserts to bring home to my dad). Then, I went back to school, and during the school year I work at a popular coffee shop, and I can't stop myself from stealing the merchandise. It's gotten so bad, and I genuinely feel so guilty and anxious all the time. I've probably stolen around 12-15 things from them, which is absolutely insane and the cost adds up quick. I'm paranoid my managers are going to somehow find out, and eventually I'll get caught. That's bad enough right? No, I have 3 new roommates this year (and I actually really like them too). 2 of them are stoners, and my habit of stealing has gotten so bad. I listen for when they leave their rooms to go to the bathroom, so then I can sneak into their room while it's unlocked and I can chief their carts quickly. One time my roommate (who btw, I consider this girl my friend and I really like her and I'm terrified she's going to find out... I'm scared all of them will actually) left her door unlocked and went to work. I smoked a few bowls of her weed and also took some. I've also taken a cart from her and my other roommate before. Some may say I'm just a fiend, and that could definitely be true too, but I think I have some serious compulsion issues. I want this to stop so bad, I don't like being on edge like this and feeling like shit. I don't like the rush of it, I don't like the adrenaline that I feel and how shaky and paranoid I become when I'm sneaking around). There's plenty of other instances too but for now I think you all get the point.

  
And for what I meant by I started doing it ""again"", is I've realized that I used to steal when I was younger too. Not nearly as bad, but when I was a kid (younger than 5th grade) I would take things every so often (extremely periodically). I remember I once stole some kids Pokémon card that I thought was cool. And there was another time where I was at a friends house and I stole one of her rocks from her rock collection (we were weird kids like that). 

  
Anyways that's the post. I want advice, thoughts, comments... literally just anything. I don't know what I really need right now or how to fix this (because part of me wants to fix it but the other part loves it)

Edit: Also I don’t feel like I can go to my friends or family about this. I can’t go to my friends because I’ve stolen from a lot of them without them knowing. And for my family, I feel very guilty and shameful and I don’t want them to think of me like that",2,1734038442.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hcvq0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1hcvq0h/successful_2star_review_removed/,Successful 2-Star Review Removed ,"Sorry this is long-Hi all. I just wanted to put this out there for hosts. My husband is a the pro at handling Airbnb when difficult guests arrive. Or even before. We had these guests instant book with one review since 2019. We allowed it for we have a third party identity validation and rental agreement and security deposit in place using Property Management System connected to Airbnb via API so we are allowed these requirements. Our House Rules are quite factual and spells our property limitations and we allow horse tours/introductions and why we don’t allow children or pets except on a case by case basis. We aee no smoking anywhere but if guests send an inquiry to smoke we do have a locations way from the house with gravel decking that we will allow. These guests did none of that. What they did do was violate Airbnb before they arrived and my husband called opened a ticket to let them know. They noted the account. They did not register their grandchildren as they would not been able to book due to max capacity. They told us after the fact they were coming. In the House Rules it states if children are allowed they must be supervised. Under no circumstances can they be left alone with wild animals and livestock it’s a safety concern. 

The guest smoked non stop going outside every 35-45 minutes all day non stop. Ok fine but when the kids arrived with their mother all three adults went inside leaving them outside and all 3 under the age of 11. They climbed down the railings of a 5 foot raised concrete deck. Very dangerous for all three did it together. If any of them were hurt we all know what they would have done, cried it wasn’t safe and those individuals were not in the reservation. Husband called Airbnb to tell them he was going over to discuss the safety issues with 3 young children and called the guest to say he was coming because they didn’t communicate via the app. They kept calling him on his phone while he tried to drugs in the app. He politely discussed the risks and rules. They called me over via the app twice to help with the smart tv they could not work it or the coffee maker (Keurig) I even took them extra pods as they complained that those provided weren’t enough. They wanted cable it’s not provided in our area. I would like cable too but too back too rural. They finally told me they were checking out early and wanted me to come over so they could checkout. I said you have nothing to do get all your things and the door even locks itself. Leave the fireplace on and trash inside we will take care of it. She said I want to smoke inside but cannot. No you cannot they chose to leave that evening. Ok great. Today we got a 2 star review. The support rep was great polite and said oh you opened a ticket already in advance. Great. He went over the photos, they said they did not match the place. They said a lot of negative things about the property all listed in the description, about the space, House Rules. The rep said your rules are great and very clear. It’s clear the guest did not read or ignored and broke at least 4 rules. He said he and his supervisor would review the review and see if it’s retaliation for enforcement of your rules. He called back and said we removed the review as it is retaliatory. 

I’d offer him his method because it works. He has always been successful with this. He is polite firm and factual but his method of calling when rules are broken especially safety rules, I think it’s key. The guest mentioned her grandchildren wasn’t allowed to be kids. And they weren’t on the reservation. We said we did not mind but the a house rules apply. The guest read them she knew cameras where on the front porch as she mentioned them when she checkout and not being able to smoke inside. 

Next time you have situation whatever it is to many people, a pet not disclosed, smoking or whatever they try my husband’s method. I am never as successful as he. He has always been successful!  Let me know if you try and it works. He never calls after hours if he can help it. Daytime workers are more helpful. Although he has had success with weekend personal as well. 

So a positive post despite tricky guests.

My brother’s friend kept putting his foot on my mouth/face,"Hey yall, so I (20F) am very disturbed and upset about something that happened last night. Just to preface, I live in a townhome with my brother and 2 other people, and we all love to hang out together. My brother has a good friend (20M) who I’ll call Andy, who always joins us whenever we smoke/drink/hang out in general. 

This might sound self absorbed which is not my intention at all, but I have long suspected that Andy is into me, just based off of his behavior towards me (always leaning over my shoulder and looking at my phone, trying to get me to drink more when we’re all drinking, nudging me when he makes jokes abt me, etc.) 

This did not bother me before, and I sort of just brushed it off while of course remaining friendly, but I still never gave him any gesture/idea whatsoever that I was into him. 

Last night, my brother and I had a bunch of people over to drink together, including Andy, and somehow my brother, one of my other roommates, andy, and I all ended up in the kitchen after everyone else left. Me being my drunk self, I dropped to the floor (I think bc I was talking to my roommate about how bad finals week went) and lay there with my eyes closed bc my body felt tired. As my roommate was telling me to get up, I felt something being smeared on my mouth, and opened my eyes to Andy looking down at me with his bare FOOT on my FACE. I was horrified, and turned my head away yelling “I don’t have a foot fetish!” At this point, I remember my roommate saying something to Andy but I’m not sure what. Even after screaming in horror and yelling no, which my brother and roommate I’m assuming was jokingly, Andy continued to look at me and put his bare foot on my mouth/face. My head is blurry as to what happened after that, but I believe I eventually got up and forgot about it in my drunk state of mind. 

Fast forward to this morning, and I went downstairs to make a cup of coffee and get started cleaning the abominable mess that we all made the previous night. Immediately Andy, who had spent the night on the living room couch, gets up and joins me in the kitchen. I hoped that my brother and roommate would wake up and come downstairs so that andy and I wouldn’t be alone together in the kitchen, but this was not the case. While I washed the million dishes we dirtied that night, andy helped throw away all the trash we left lying around, occasionally trying to strike up conversation with me and asking me questions. I was irritable and disturbed by what had happened, and honestly so tired from a shitty week, that I responded to him with dry answers and sometimes pretended not to hear him, hoping he’d get the hint I just wanted to be alone. (Spoiler alert: he didn’t.) Once I finished the dishes I began to deep clean the kitchen (it was disgusting and everyone was about to be moving out for winter break), he offered to help, which I politely declined multiple times. At this point he just sits at the kitchen counter watching me clean and looking at his phone. I wished he would just go away, but I tried my best to ignore the fact that he was there. 

Anyways, I’ve been really short with my brother and roommate all morning/afternoon because this whole occurrence has been bothering me, and I want to say something to them about it but I’m almost positive they’ll see it as me overreacting. I thought it might be true that I am making a bigger deal out of this than it really is, but I’ve given it more thought, and each time I do the situation become more revolting to me considering what might have been going on in Andy’s head as he stared at me with his bare foot on my mouth/face and what twisted fetishes he might have been catering to. Everytime I think about it I want to cry, and it doesn’t help that I’ve been an extreme germaphobe my entire life. I’m very hurt that my brother just watched his friend violate my personal space like that, because he’s an amazing brother so I would expect him to look out for me in a situation like this. Also, before one of yall say it, I know that I should have just gotten up. But I was very drunk, and when I get drunk I become unconfrontational. I also DID turn away from Andy and yell no, which I think should have been enough. 
I’m really disappointed, because I can’t see myself ever feeling comfortable hanging out with my brother and roommate when Andy is around, which is sad because he’s there almost every time. I always try to see the good in people, but if I’m being honest, something has always made me feel a bit uncomfortable around Andy. I always find myself becoming irritable when he’s around, and i previously scolded myself for feeling this way, but now I can’t view him as anything but a creep. 

Sorry for making this an entire novel long, but I’m frustrated and feel bad for being short with my brother and roommate, but I don’t know what else to do. AIO?

tl;dr: when my roommate, brother, and his friend were all intoxicated,my brother’s friend continually put his bare foot on my face as I was lying on the ground and my brother and roommate saw but didn’t really do anything to stop it  ",1,1734038252.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I am bright and a hard worker. I am amazing in customer service. I thrive in a fast paced environment. I really love working as part of a team, and when I was working, it brought me a lot of joy and confidence. 

There is nothing I want to do more than work my ass off, rebuild my life, and get myself through my degree. 

This reddit post is my cry for help - a last resort after 100s of applications sent through seek, indeed, and handed out in person, have all been met with 100s of “no”s. 

There must be something I am doing wrong, I want nothing more than to work for a cafe or restaurant, or at a bar. Unfortunately yes - I don’t have prior experience, but I need to start working to get ex perience. 

I am sending cover letters in my applications and have handed out resumes too in person. I’ve been using seek and indeed to apply. I have full availability to work as well! 

What else should I be doing? Can anyone give me advice on what I should change or try next? I will be contacting an employment agency today and continuing this search. It just gets hard hearing no after no. Any and all advice is appreciated!

Advice? ,"Alright, so, I (24M) have been interested in a girl (24F) from school since I met her. So far, we've only been friends without discussion of dating. We've known each other for about a year but only recently starting making an effort to get to know each other better about two months ago. 

With this in mind, let's talk about the events of yesterday (12/11/24). Yesterday morning, she messaged a couple friends and I asking for help getting a ride places to get a new car. In her text, she included reasons why she was asking us, not other people, and I ignored most of this addional information as I only cared about her saying she needed help. As I was free all day, having a day off and not having any schoolwork to do, I was there to pick her up within an hour. 

For the first couple hours, we went to the bank, a coffee shop to do some research, and her place to do more research and for her to get paystubs. Within this time, she showed me in three ways that she was comfortable with/trusted me: she had me use the atm for her as she needed to get more money out after not getting enough out inside, she let me inside her place despite no one else being home, and she let me sit next to her on her bed while she was doing research after my attempts avoid invading her privacy by standing outside her bedroom. 

After research time, we went to visit a small time dealership. Something to note, without disclosing too much of her financial situation (to respect her privacy), she didn't have a lot going for her to get a respectable car loan. So, the small dealer wouldn't work with her without a cosigner (which she didn't have).

From there, we went to a bigger dealer in town for a better chance for her to get a car. She needed a car in the same day as her current one broke down. She knew she'd get ripped off at the bigger dealer but her circumstances pushed her to take the risk. 

At the big dealer, I sat with her for almost three hours in torture. Not due to the time we sat there, I was too happy about getting to spend time with her, but due to having to watch her jump numerous hurdles to get a loan with a car she wanted (something I've never had to do or experience). In this time, I offered help with the down payment and mentioned I felt bad watching her have to go through all this stuff. She finally accepted a little help with the down payment ($150) even though I was willing/able to help with more. 

Here's the detail that haunts me. So, after we paid the down payment, they walked printed out the papers and directed her to the signing room. As I already spent a few hours next to her, learning much of her finances and other details more suitable to learn in more serious relationships, I decided to let her do that part by herself to respect her adultness autonomy (perse). Well, due to inexperience of this process/a little ignorance, I didn't know that was when the interest rate would be discussed. It wasn't until we went to lunch (as she promised for helping out) I found out that her rate was 24%. Upon hearing this, part of me died and regretted letting her go in that room alone. 

So, here's the dilemma, do I cross a line and talk to her about returning the car? I was talking to a coworker and he said per the law in Ohio, she has three days to return the car under any circumstances. If I do this, I could stop her from having an interest rate that could potentially ruin her.
 But with her limited options, the only way I could help her get a better rate would be to cosign with her. My credit is really good and would help bring it down quite a bit I think. My gut says to help her as I do trust her, especially after she displayed trust in me and her being way too concerned about ""not taking advantage of me"" when I offered to help. But my brain says don't offer to cosign as I know it's always a bad idea to with people you don't know too well. 

Idk what to do. I want to help her out but with how early our friendship is and the situation, I keep going back and forth. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ",1,1734037901.0,relationship_advice,8,0.6,False

My housemate went on holiday tuesday morning leaving me alone for the week. I don't often get time alone so I planned my time around working a little each day then playing games for the rest of the day. About 12pm and several joints I was getting hungry and had an amazing idea. I was gonna make a massive homemade lasagne and eat it over the course of the week. 

At this point I had no idea what it would do to my body and if future me could talk to the me from tuesday, I would have warned him.


Day 1 Tuesday Morning.

So I get all the stuff and spend an hour or so making a massive, 7 layer lasagne with nearly a whole block of cheese, several tins of tomatoes and a layer of apple sauce in the middle to give it a sweet tang. It was enough to feed 10 peoole easily. It smelt so good.


Tuesday lunchtime. Portion 1

I fried some chips/ fries and garlic bread and sat down to eat it was amazing. I was so thrilled it turned out great.


Tuesdays evening. Portion 2

Still just as delicious, even better maybe after letting it sit for a few hours. Nothing brewing in my body yet,  it was the calm before the storm.


Tuesday Midnight. Portion 3.

I believe this was my first mistake. I had been smoking a few joints and watching AVGN on YouTube and all of sudden I remember that I made a massive lasagne, I tried to resist but my stoner brain only lasted about 5 minutes before I had more and cooked some midnight garlic bread to go with it . It still tasted good. After eating I noticed I was starting to get acid relax, I took an lanzoprazol and tried to sleep.


Wednesday morning. Portion 4

I woke up and my stomach was grumbling so I went and plated up another helping of lasagne. It tasted okay, not as delicious as my previous 3 helpings but I put that down to it being early and i had just woken up.

It's at this point my stomach acid kicked up again and I needed a shit really badly.

I ran to the toilet and had the runniest shit id had in a long time, it was almost painful. Now at this point you would normally go, hmmm maybe I should lay off the lasagne for a bit but it never occurred to me at the time that 4 meals of lasagne could produce such bad bowls. I felt better after so quickly forgot about it.


Wednesday lunchtime. Portion 5.

I know It might seem crazy but at about 2pm I was hungry. I had work to get on with but and didn't have the time to cook anything and nothing to grab quickly except lasagne. So back I went. At this point half the lasagne is gone and half remains.

This time the lasagne didn't taste that great. But I ate it cause i needed to have something to give ne some energy.

I realised at the point that my stomach felt weird, like painful and uncomfortable. I made myself some coffee and expected a poo but nothing came. Just a horrible feeling something wasn't right


Wednesday evening. Portion 6 - The final Portion.

After finishing work I looked at the remaining lasagne.
I know I thought, maybe it's cause I've had no salad or vegetables with it. That will make it taste better and give me some thing to sort my stomach out.

So I made some salad, more garlic bread and the final  portion. I knew immediately after eating it i had made a terrible mistake. My bowls started aching and making noises.

I ran to the toilet and as my arse hit the seat, a volcano of red hot shit erupted from my anus.

It was so painful, my arse was on fire. Some of the shit came out so violently that it somehow shot upwards, pebble dashing to toilet lid behind me. I don't even know how that's possible. Maybe shit collided with other bits of shit in motion and exploded Either way it was the worse toilet experience of my life.

Then came the smell, it was delayed almost, like I was in so much pain the universe said  ""let's give him a minute before we hit him with the smell""

It was like acid, this putred gas almost instantly made me feel sick. I wanted to run out of the toilet and seek fresh air but the shit was still exploding out of me. I had no choice but to hold my nose and  breath through my mouth which was  horrible. All I thought was, I'm getting this acidic shit smell in my mouth. 

After what seemed like 5 minutes of lava bursting out of me, It stopped but at what cost. My butthole was still on fire, its like someone was holding a lighter tomy anus. The smell was so bad I had to wipe quickly and escape this hell I had created, but my anus hurt so much every wipe was like dragging sandpaper over it. I winced with every wipe and was almost in tears and it was so messy it took a lot of wiping.

I stumbled put of the toilet, like a cowboy who's been on his horse for days. I couldn't sit down, all I could do was lie on my side in bed and try to get to sleep.


Thursday morning.

I woke up and I could instantly feel my anus burning. Before I'd even registered I was awake. Whats worse is that I needed another shit. I was terrified at this point. After yesterday I had toilet trauma. I knew there was still a portion of two inside me and it wasn't gonna be good.

It went just how you expect. It was another fowl smelling liquid shit that each strain felt like a knife in my anus, I held onto the towel rail and forced as much out as I could each push. I figured if I can get it all done quickly it wouldn't be so bad. It kinda worked but I think the damage was done at this point so I painfully cleaned myself and waddled to my desk and worked Standing up for the rest of the day.


Thursday lunchtime.

The constant pain subsided but I still had bad gas and every fart was agony. The smell was just as bad though. Something was still rotting inside me. At least I could sit  down to work now. I wasn't hungry and decided to fast for the day. I didn't dare put more food in me. 


Thursday evening

As I type this I'm lying in bed, on my side. I can feel the last of the lasagne on its way and I'm dreading going through this, even if it's one last time. My anus still burns when I fart and that is happening often. It's freezing cold but I need the window open to let the smell of my approaching shit out.

There's a lesson to be learned here. Don't under any circumstances eat nothing but lasagne and garlic bread for every meal for 2 days. Nothing good cam come from it.

TLDR: I ate nothing but lasagne for every meal for 2 days and now my anus is on fire constantly and I smell like a rotten skunk.",147,1734037679.0,tifu,148,0.76,False

Tide: The tide should reach nearly SEVEN feet. Combined with the swell, it ought to make things interesting.

COFFEE? At minimum, show up with a mug in hand. Those who are outdoor brewers, show us what you’ve got with camp stoves, hand grinders, fancy tea, whatever you’ve got. You don’t have to share, but it would be wonderful if you can share coffee/water/tea with others.

FOOD? Last time we did this, some participants arrived with pastries. Will it happen again?

SEATING: There isn’t any seating out there at the slough entrance. If you want to sit down and relax, bring your favorite camping chair.

BIKES? Walk-ins welcome. I am guessing that the lot will be closed to cars. 

RAIN or Mayhem: If the swells make the slough entrance too hazardous and/or, it is raining. Head west until you see bikes, coffee mugs, and hearty participants. Folks who do this stuff generally adapt to all conditions.

My cravings in poetry feel like a trap ""and"" a gateway to not stay insane or seek praise. 

Press on the memories of what I remember and how soft spoken I can be. I don't seek to give punishments for eternity.

I miss being there for my gremlins. My hobitses.

This last year has sucked in terms of internal turmoil. Something I want to make clear about this foil.

Because as I told you during that terrible night fight of a bottle about to be opened with a knife. One of the first stories I've told on here alone if you go far enough back in my posts this time. ""I hope to never understand having that much hate in my life.""

Or maybe you'd remember it more like this, verbatim ""do you understand what it's like to hold so much hate for someone?""...and this was my response-""...no, and I hope I never do..."" And then I left the room. The choices we've made have never been up to me. Only you. All I did was show you the routes that were available on our skew.

...I...will...never...hate you...I will always love you....it's true, and if I must die saying these as my last words? I'll ask this, when am I due?",2,1734037410.0,Poems,1,1.0,False

1hcva8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hcva8r/beneath_the_citys_skin/,Beneath the City’s Skin,"At dawn, Detective Marcus Harrell stepped around pooled rainwater behind the old shipping docks, the tang of rust and decay heavy in the air. Two victims lay sprawled beneath a sagging loading ramp, framed by the crumbling warehouse wall streaked with rust and mildew. The air reeked of damp wood and decay, mingling with the metallic tang of blood pooling around their mutilated bodies. Nearby, jagged shards of broken crates and twisted chains added to the scene’s desolation, as if the setting itself recoiled from the brutality on display. Each had been torn open, organs spilled like grotesque ornaments. A forensic tech took photographs in grim silence; no one was joking, no one was making small talk. These scenes had become too frequent.

Detective Sonia Alvarez crouched low, pulling a plastic sheet carefully over one victim’s hand. His fingernails were cracked, caked with blood and dirt. “He tried to fight back,” she said, voice quiet. “They usually do.” She released the sheet and stood, hugging her arms. “What could do this? The wounds... they’re all wrong. Not blades, not bullets. Something else.”

Marcus nodded. He’d seen all manner of cruelty in his twenty years, but this set of murders—four in a month—confounded them. Some of the gashes were too ragged, as though inflicted by talons rather than tools. He wanted to come up with a logical culprit: a deranged killer with custom weapons, maybe. But that didn’t explain the animalistic patterns, the sheer savagery.

Sonia’s gaze swept the scene. “We’re missing something,” she said. “None of these victims had reason to be here. They weren’t locals, had no known ties to the area, and their belongings suggest they were heading somewhere else entirely. Yet, they all ended up here, in this forgotten part of the city. Why?” Her tone sharpened. “All of them ended up in remote, neglected parts of the city, places where fewer eyes would notice.” She glanced at Marcus with unease. “There’s something unsettling about how they all came to be here.”

He said nothing, only turned to watch the hazy sky lighten over rooftops crowned with twisted metal. If it was a person, they were dealing with an unimaginably vicious psychopath. If it wasn’t a person… He pushed the thought aside. The team packed up, the crime scene tape fluttering weakly against a rising breeze.

Back at the precinct, Sonia pored over old case files. The department’s cramped archives smelled of mildew and old coffee, the stale air thick with dust motes swirling in the dim fluorescent light. Rows of leaning shelves groaned under the weight of forgotten files, their edges curled and stained with age. A faint rustling of paper and the occasional creak of wood punctuated the oppressive silence. Marcus stood behind her, shoulders tense, as she flipped through a folder of cold cases. She paused on an old photograph: a mutilated corpse found near the drainage canals six years back. The wounds looked eerily similar.

“I remember hearing rumors,” she said. “Back then, the detective in charge—Lopez, I think—claimed the killer wasn’t human. People rolled their eyes. Eventually, the murders stopped.”

Marcus leaned over her shoulder. “And now they’ve started again.” He scanned the reports: mention of footprints too large and misshapen to match any known animal, scattered sightings of something moving too fast for the witnesses to describe. He tapped the page. “All near damp areas: abandoned docks, flooded basements, old drainage tunnels.”

“Sounds like a habitat,” Sonia said grimly. “As if it needs these environments. Maybe it thrives in rot and moisture.”

Marcus suppressed a shiver. “We need leads,” he said. “Let’s talk to the patrol officers working the midnight shifts. Someone must have seen something.”

They corralled a few uniforms into the briefing room: Officer Daniels, nervous fingers tapping his belt, Officer Reyes, jaw clenched tight, and Officer Kim, arms folded, her mouth a thin line. These three had patrolled the neglected fringes of the city for months.

“We hear rumors,” Daniels said, barely above a whisper. His fingers fidgeted with his belt, his gaze darting to the floor. “Some folks sleeping rough say there’s something that crawls out of old sewer grates at night.” His voice trembled slightly, betraying the nervous energy he tried to suppress. At first, we thought it was just another drug-induced hallucination. But then we heard it ourselves.”

Reyes nodded. “Heard it behind that condemned train station. A scraping. A kind of growl, but… not a dog, not even close.” He swallowed. “We found deep scratches on a metal doorframe. No animal I know can carve steel like that.”

Kim just shook her head. “We shine a flashlight, it’s gone. No footprints in the mud—at least, none we can follow. Just weird impressions, like splayed claws.”

Sonia offered a reassuring nod. “Keep this quiet,” she said. “We’re on it.”

As they left, Marcus caught a glimpse of Daniels rubbing a small St. Christopher medal between his thumb and forefinger. The officers were on edge, and that said a lot. They saw enough human brutality to be inured to fear. Whatever lurked out there had them praying for daylight.

Night spread over the city. Sonia and Marcus followed a fresh tip—an anonymous caller claimed to have seen something hunched and massive slinking around an abandoned waterfront district. The buildings here leaned into each other, splintered wood and peeled paint reflecting faint moonlight. The smell of rot, oil, and salt water hung heavy.

They moved through cavernous halls piled with broken crates and chains that clanked when the wind stirred. Marcus stopped, heart thudding. A faint rasping sound echoed from the far end of a storage bay. The beam of his flashlight caught a shape. It unfurled, rising unnaturally tall, gaunt limbs corded with muscle under ashen skin. Red eyes flashed back at them.

Before Marcus could call out, the thing rushed forward with impossible speed. Sonia fired twice, the shots thunderous. Sparks danced off metal beams. The creature hissed, recoiling, but only for a second. Its head swiveled as if searching for weakness. It leapt sideways, clinging to a wall, then bounded overhead and vanished through a gap in the roof.

They sprinted outside, breathing hard, but it was gone. Marcus shone his light along the brick walls. “It reacted to the gunshots,” he said. “But it didn’t seem wounded.”

Sonia’s voice trembled slightly. “It’s something else. Not just an animal.” She glanced down at a damp patch near the building’s foundation. Moss and algae spread over broken pavement. “It’s drawn to places like this, nesting where rot and moisture pool.” She looked at him, eyes wide. “Maybe it needs these conditions to survive.”

Marcus wiped sweat from his brow. The encounter had shaken him deeply. “We need more firepower,” he said quietly. “And backup that believes what we saw.”

They drove back without speaking. The image of that figure—elongated limbs, hungry eyes—lodged in their minds like a barbed hook.

The next day, Captain Miller listened, arms crossed. “You want more men? More weapons? Based on what?”

Sonia passed him an evidence bag a splinter of material caught on her bullet casing, dark and fibrous, not quite hair, not quite hide. “Lab can’t identify it. It’s not human. Whatever this is, it resists bullets and moves faster than anything we’ve seen.”

Miller eyed them. “I can’t feed this story to the brass. But I’ll give you a few people and weapons. Be discreet. Make it count.”

They selected Daniels, Reyes, and Kim—they’d seen signs, they wouldn’t question the mission’s sincerity. Add two more veterans: O’Leary, who always kept a lucky coin in his vest pocket, and Fraser, who once cornered a sniper on a rooftop and talked him down. They were steady hands, each bringing their own quiet confidence and dread.

That night, armed with rifles and heavy flashlights, they returned to the waterfront. With no sign of the creature aboveground, Sonia and Marcus searched for access points to the underbelly of the city. Behind a stack of rotting pallets, they found a rusted hatch embedded in the concrete. With effort, they pried it open. A damp gust rushed out, carrying the scent of stagnant water and old earth.

They descended into darkness, flashlights slicing through the gloom. The corridor stretched into a maze of brickwork, dripping pipes, and moss-grown walls. Footsteps splashed in shallow puddles. They came upon a chamber where the floor had collapsed into a watery hollow. Bones littered the perimeter—human and animal. Twisted ribs and skulls scattered as if arranged by chaotic appetite.

Daniels gagged. Reyes’s jaw muscles twitched. Kim whispered a prayer. O’Leary palmed his lucky coin; Fraser squared his shoulders, muttering, “Sweet Mother Mary.”

In the silence, a scraping sound something was here. The flashlights swept around, catching a flash of movement in an alcove. The creature emerged, hissing softly. Its eyes glowed brighter now, limbs quivering. Marcus realized it looked leaner than before—perhaps the wounds from bullets had taken some toll. Good. Maybe they could finish it.

They focused their beams directly on it. The thing shrank from the glare, raising an arm to shield its face. Sonia fired, the bullet striking home. A thick, oily fluid oozed. It snarled, lunging forward. Fraser and O’Leary cut it off, their shots echoing. The creature veered, leaping onto a side ledge. Daniels aimed at its eyes, and it shrieked, rattled by the concentrated light and gunfire.

It roared—a sound of fury and desperation. Marcus advanced slowly, rifle steady. “Keep the lights on it!” he shouted. “It hates the light!” The creature tried to rush him, but slipped on wet stone, falling into the water with a splash. Another volley of bullets hammered into its flank. It writhed, scuttling over jagged debris.

Then it did something unexpected it reached for an overhead pipe trying to climb up and out. As it strained, Marcus glimpsed something behind it a mound of gelatinous sacs, half-submerged. Eggs. The realization stunned him. This wasn’t a random killing spree. It was feeding, preparing a nursery in the city’s veins. If they hadn’t come, an entire brood might have emerged. Suddenly, the creature let out a guttural roar and swung its limb with unexpected force, shattering a nearby overhead light. The chamber was momentarily plunged into flickering shadows, the creature using the dimness to dart closer. It slashed at a crumbling pipe, releasing a spray of scalding steam, forcing the team to scatter. The unexpected maneuver left them momentarily vulnerable.

Sonia saw it too. Her eyes hardened. “We need to kill it now!” She aimed at the cluster, and the creature screamed as if understanding her intent. It leapt down, barreling into Kim, who fired a shot into its chest. O’Leary rushed forward, shoving it back, only to take a slash across his shoulder. He cried out, stumbling, lucky coin clattering to the ground.

The creature snarled, but its strength was fading. Marcus and Reyes fired together, bullets ripping through sinew. It collapsed onto a protruding length of rebar. Sonia hesitated, then shot again. The creature’s shriek rattled the chamber, echoing down corridors. It thrashed, black fluid staining the water, growing weaker with each second.

As it died, a tremor shuddered through the tunnel system. Pipes groaned. A distant splash and rumble suggested some old masonry giving way. The officers exchanged nervous looks. Sonia stepped forward, shining her light on the creature’s face. Its eyes dimmed, lips curling back to reveal teeth like splintered bone. Marcus aimed at the egg clutch and fired. The sacs ruptured, their contents spilling into the murky pool. The creature let out a final rasping moan, as if mourning its brood, then fell limp.

A hush fell over them, broken only by the drip of water and O’Leary’s labored breathing. Daniels helped him wrap a makeshift bandage around his arm, his hands trembling slightly as he glanced repeatedly at his St. Christopher medal, now smudged with sweat and dirt. Kim shone her flashlight around, her lips moving in a whispered prayer as though clinging to it as a shield against the oppressive dread. “This… it was nesting,” she said softly. “Not just killing for sport.”

Reyes looked pale. “If we hadn’t found this place, what would’ve happened to the city?” He didn’t want the answer, and no one offered one. They stood there, rifles lowered, ears still ringing from gunshots.

Marcus felt no triumph, just a hollow relief. “Let’s get out of here,” he said, voice low.

They retraced their steps, careful over wet stone. Another distant rumble shivered through the old infrastructure. Perhaps killing the creature had disturbed something—cracks spidered along the walls. The city’s foundations had endured a century of neglect; maybe their firefight had shaken loose old secrets. Marcus wondered if somewhere deeper underground, there were more tunnels, more nests waiting. He forced the thought away.

Upstairs, dawn washed over the deserted waterfront. The officers emerged grim and silent, their faces etched with exhaustion and haunted by the night’s events. Daniels clutched his St. Christopher medal tightly, his lips moving in a barely audible prayer. Kim hesitated at the threshold, glancing back at the darkness below as if expecting something to follow. Reyes exhaled heavily, his clenched fists finally relaxing. Marcus looked at Sonia, whose gaze was fixed on the horizon, her jaw set but her eyes betraying a lingering unease. Each carried their own silent burden as they stepped into the light, unsure if the horrors they had witnessed were truly over. Miller wouldn’t get a neat explanation. They’d say it was a deranged killer holed up below, that they’d destroyed the lair and ended the threat. The truth would remain in that wet darkness, along with shattered eggs and a body that would be hard to explain.

They returned to the precinct. Sonia sat at her desk, fingers hovering over her report form. How do you describe something so alien, its motives both bestial and maternal? She settled on describing what they’d found: a disturbed predator feeding and nesting underground. But the words felt inadequate. Marcus drifted over, shoulder sore, watching her type. Neither said much.

Daniels paced by the coffee machine, still rattled but alive. Reyes leaned against a window, staring at the sunrise. Kim scribbled in her notebook, perhaps her own private record of what happened. O’Leary, arm bandaged, flipped his lucky coin over and over, wordless. Fraser sat hunched, his mind distant.

No one laughed or celebrated. They were relieved, yes, but changed. The city outside looked the same—cars honking, people heading to work—but they knew the fragile world beneath their feet, the hidden places thick with grime and secrets, had nearly birthed something monstrous.

In the following days, life returned to a tense normality. The murders stopped. Headlines credited the police with halting a serial killer. Captain Miller shook their hands, but never asked for the full truth. The mayor praised their “heroic efforts” on television, though he’d never understand the horrors below.

Sonia and Marcus met at a quiet bar near the station. They clinked their glasses in silence. The memory of the creature, that underground lair, and those eggs weighed heavily between them. There was no neat closure. They’d prevented a catastrophe, but now knew their city was layered with secrets that defied easy explanations.

Marcus eyed the condensation on his glass. “We stopped it. But… what if it wasn’t alone? What if something else slithers through the old pipes, just waiting?”

Sonia looked toward the window. Night had fallen. The streetlights hummed. “I don’t know,” she said softly. “I guess we keep watch.” She offered a faint, sad smile. They had done what they could, sealed one crack in the dam. But the darkness beneath the city’s skin lingered, as old and patient as the sewers themselves.

No formal coda would come. The world wouldn’t end tonight, but they understood how thin the veil truly was. Outside, sirens wailed far off. Life went on. Yet Sonia and Marcus knew, as they sipped their drinks in uneasy silence, that the foundations of the city were never as solid as everyone liked to pretend. Something had stirred, and even though it lay dead beneath the concrete, its presence had changed them, leaving a question echoing in their minds:

To be completely transparent some periods of time I do not work and he pays the bills. We can still afford things like eating out, Energy drinks/coffees , Concerts. 

We have been together for 11 years. During that time he has had an affair, multiple ones within a time period and basically continued to be unfaithful until he was caught. 

I have forgiven him and he says once he was caught he never did it again or wanted to and he will never do it again. He says he loves me and has never stopped loving me even during all of that and that it was about his own self esteem. That he will never leave me and I will have to make a choice to leave him if it ever comes to that. 

During the entire relationship he has given me maybe 4 gifts one year an xbox headset he wrapped in the Walmart bag and tossed under the tree..

This is after me crying every single holiday, asking him to gift me even things he can make or things that do not cost anything. well here we are again... 

Today he told me that if I am not happy I can find someone else. I am consistently getting that response when I bring up how unhappy I am. When I decide to say I want to leave he says he can't stop me and it's my choice. 

I can't tell if he will be upset or not.. He is really passionate and considerate sometimes which is why this is all so confusing to me because he genuinely acts like he cares sometimes.

We love FL and wouldn't want to live anywhere with a colder climate (unless it's a place elsewhere in the South that checks all of our other boxes). We lived in Chicago and NYC, which we left because of the madness during Covid and we would never move back to a city of that size. At the time we chose St. Augustine because of COL, ability to own a home, overall good public schools, proximity to the beach, walkable downtown, AND because we were told it's where a lot of young families live/relocate to. Turns out our island's median age is 55, and there are no baby classes withing 20 miles radius. It seems that during Covid more and more retirees flooded this area who were priced out of South FL. The young families are in the suburbs of Jax, like in Nocatee/Ponte Vedra, but we just couldn't live in total suburbia. We love all the outdoor activities (hiking, kayaking) and that we are able to walk to coffee shops, parks, the grocery, beach, etc. - but we were unsuccessful at making friends our age (we tried hard and only befriended older folks), and now that we realize that there aren't any group classes for babies to meet people (let alone other same-sex couples with kids), we started to seriously doubt our decision to move here. 

  
We started looking into parts of South Florida that are more inclusive for LGBT families and have lots of activities for young families but they are not walkable at all (Coral Springs, West Delray/Boca Raton). 

In the past we looked into these options and ruled them out for different reasons: Austin, Asheville, Madison. 

Open to any suggestions, especially in FL. We are okay with renting at first but would like to be able to buy a home eventually (max. 550k). 

PS. I am from Europe and can't wrap my head around the fact that Americans accept that they need to live in suburbia to have good public schools. I grew up in a large EU city where schools right downtown are excellent. ",0,1734037117.0,SameGrassButGreener,3,0.5,False

i had spilled an entire cup of coffee into the keyboard, so i removed all the keys to clean as much as i could (removing keys was the only option, as you have to rip the back off to access the board any other way).

the keyboard works fine now, but the first 3 F keys are not clicking in place correctly, unlike all the other buttons. the retainer clips are different than the other keys too, as they seem to sit interwoven into each other, instead of clicking into each other like the other clips do. i spent over an hour just getting one of those clips back into position, unlike all the other clips, so i don't understand how to reassemble it.

the clips and buttons are not broken, but the clips seem to be unique and correspond to the keys they attach to; all other clips seem identical to their similar keys.

does anyone know how to replace these keys? do i have to place the clips into the key first? every other key just clips into the retainer clips.

any advise would be greatly appreciated; i've had this keyboard for years, so i would rather try to fix it than replace it (or do irreversible damage like just trying to glue the cap to the rubber switch and just toss the clips).

Life changes have always been hard for me, but NEVER that bad. Usually the first day (sometimes the second) are really hard and then I start getting more positive. 

The only thing I can genuinely think about is killing myself. It feels like all the stuff that usually make me feel better aren’t doing it. I don’t wanna listen to music, ride my bike (these are the two things that absolutely never miss to make me feel better), don’t want to watch a movie. 

There’s nothing wrong with the job in itself, the boss is super nice, the place and appliances are amazing.

But i genuinely am scared that the anxiety I’m feeling right now are gonna make me do the act.

I’m terrified of just having to wake up tomorrow.
The only thing I wanna do is sleep and for time to stop. I don’t wanna see the sun.

We do this exercise with my therapist where I imagine a place where I’m completely free of any negative thoughts, it usually works really well. Now it’s just tears and death.

You might think it’s a little quick to get scared so fast, but the amount of pain I’m in right now is very concerning. 
Making coffee wish used to be the one thing that would make me want to stay alive, the thought doesn’t even make me feel the tiniest bit better. 

Any ideas on what I should do, I am very desperate for some answers, I’m not sure I’ll be able to handle this amount of pain for much longer. ",2,1734036561.0,bipolar2,1,1.0,False

I was the one kicking myself for losing my center and a two year relationship falling apart as I was flipping out because I wasn't getting the validation I wanted. Anyway, she reached out......

She had some issues with her business and a referral for construction work done I had given her from a friend, and basically, this referral doesn't finish the job and left her out like 5k. I read this as her not reaching out for anything romantic, told her I would make some calls to try and track the guy down and if I hear anything I will let her know. Obviously felt bad since it was my referral. Not cold, not happy to hear from her, but indifferent was my response. Sooooo

She started asking about me, etc. Still, I gave her minimal info, some mystery, and that everything was going great and asked about her and got back a neutral response. She kept the Convo going though. I figured ""what the hell"", gave her the old wine bottle and dinner at my place routine so we can catch up. 

She responded that she finally got into therapy (i had encouraged her to do this during our relationship), and she cares deeply about me, but she doesn't know if her ""heart/brain"" can handle coming to my place right now. But she wants to meet for coffee and hear about my life. 

Normally a coffee date I wouldn't take but.....at the breakup 3 months ago she wanted to meet in a public place and not her apartment because of all our memories there, and she was afraid she couldn't follow through with it. So I understand her connection to me, places, and memories. And her talking about how her heart and brain couldn't handle being at my place, along with her finally going into therapy, all sound like someone that is interested in seeing me, wants to see if there is anything more between us, but wants to take things super slow. I'm inclined to meet her for coffee only because of the therapy news and her admitting her heart and brain couldn't handle coming to my place. 

Am I out of my mind if I agree to this? If she just said ""no, let's meet for coffee"" I would do the corey routine of the take away about drinks and my place and when she's interested to come over.

Alright, let's talk about what you actually get with Azon Word Hunt Maker. This software is packed with features that make creating word search puzzles a breeze. Here's what caught my eye:

One of the coolest things about this software is its massive word database. We're talking over a million words at your fingertips. This means you can create puzzles on virtually any theme or topic you can think of.

Don't want to manually input words for your puzzles? No problem. Azon Word Hunt Maker can automatically generate words for your puzzles. This is a huge time-saver, especially if you're planning to create multiple books.

While I haven't explored all the customization options yet, the software does allow you to tweak your puzzles. You can likely adjust things like grid size, word placement, and difficulty level to suit your target audience.

# 5. Solution Generation

Every good puzzle book needs solutions, right? Azon Word Hunt Maker automatically generates solutions for each puzzle you create. This saves you from the headache of manually creating answer keys.

# Benefits of Azon Word Hunt Maker and Who Can Benefit from It

Now that we've covered the features, let's talk about why Azon Word Hunt Maker is such a game-changer and who can benefit from it.

# Time-Saving

The biggest benefit, hands down, is the time you'll save. Normally, creating a single word search puzzle can take up to 20 minutes or more. With Azon Word Hunt Maker, you can do it in seconds. If you're planning to create multiple puzzles for a book, this can save you hours, if not days, of work.

# No Design Skills Needed

You don't need to be a graphic designer to create professional-looking puzzles. The software does all the heavy lifting for you, generating clean, attractive puzzles that are ready to be included in your books.

# Variety and Flexibility

With its huge word database and customization options, you can create a wide variety of puzzles. This means you can target different niches or create themed books (like holiday puzzles, educational puzzles for kids, etc.).

# Passive Income Potential

Once you've created your puzzle book and listed it on Amazon, it can potentially generate passive income for you. People are always looking for new puzzle books, so there's a constant market.

So, who can benefit from Azon Word Hunt Maker? Here are a few groups that come to mind:

1. **Aspiring Authors**: If you've wanted to publish a book but weren't sure where to start, puzzle books can be a great entry point. 
2. **Teachers and Educators**: Create custom word searches for your students or even sell educational puzzle books.

This is the most straightforward approach. Use Azon Word Hunt Maker to create a collection of puzzles, design a cover, and publish your book on Amazon using their Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform. You can create themed books (like ""Christmas Word Searches"" or ""Animal Word Puzzles for Kids"") to target specific audiences.

# 2. Offer Custom Puzzle Creation Services

Businesses, schools, or event planners might want custom word searches for various purposes. You could offer your services to create these puzzles quickly and efficiently.

# 3. Create and Sell Digital Puzzle PDFs

Instead of physical books, you could create PDF collections of puzzles and sell them on platforms like Etsy or your own website.

# 4. Use Puzzles as Lead Magnets

If you have a blog or a business, you could create free puzzles to attract subscribers or customers. For example, a language learning website could offer themed word searches to engage their audience.

# 5. Sell the Software Itself

# How to Use Azon Word Hunt Maker

Now, let's talk about how to actually use this software. While I haven't had a chance to explore every single feature in depth, I can give you a general idea of how it works based on the information provided and my initial experience.

1. **Installation**: First, you'll need to install the software on your Windows PC. It works on Windows 7 and higher, so most modern PCs should be fine. 
2. **Launch the Software**: Once installed, open up Azon Word Hunt Maker. 
3. **Choose Your Settings**: You'll likely see options to set your puzzle parameters. This might include things like grid size, difficulty level, and theme. 
4. **Select or Input Words**: You can either manually input words for your puzzle or use the automatic word generation feature. 
5. **Generate the Puzzle**: Here's where the magic happens. With just a click of a button, the software will create your puzzle. 
6. **Generate the Solution**: Another click, and you've got the solution to go with your puzzle. 
7. **Export**: Once you're happy with your puzzle, you can export it in a format suitable for including in your book design. 
8. **Repeat**: Create as many puzzles as you need for your book or project. 

The interface is described as beginner-friendly and intuitive, so even if you're not tech-savvy, you should be able to figure it out pretty quickly.

Remember, the whole point of this software is to make the process quick and easy. So don't overthink it – just dive in and start creating!

# My Personal Experience as a Beta Tester

As a beta tester for Azon Word Hunt Maker, I've had the chance to play around with the software before its official launch. I've got to say, it's been a pretty eye-opening experience.

When I first heard about the concept, I was skeptical. I mean, how hard could it be to make word search puzzles, right? Boy, was I wrong! I tried creating a puzzle manually, and it took me nearly half an hour. That's when I really appreciated what Azon Word Hunt Maker could do.

I decided to create a small puzzle book as a test. I chose a theme – let's say, ""Fruits and Vegetables"" – and got to work. In less than an hour, I had created 20 different puzzles, complete with solutions. It would have taken me days to do this manually!

The automatic word generation was a lifesaver. I didn't have to rack my brain trying to come up with words that fit my theme. The software did it all for me. And the best part? The puzzles looked professional. They weren't just jumbled letters on a page – they were well-designed, clean, and ready to be put into a book.

I exported the puzzles, whipped up a simple cover using Canva, and uploaded everything to Amazon KDP. Within 24 hours, my book was live on Amazon. I set a modest price of $6.99, and to my surprise, I made my first sale within a week!

Now, I'm not saying everyone will have the same results. But this experience showed me the potential of Azon Word Hunt Maker. It's not just about creating puzzles – it's about opening up a whole new avenue for creating products to sell.

# Azon Word Hunt Maker Funnel / OTOs

Alright, let's talk about the pricing structure for Azon Word Hunt Maker. The creator has set up what's called a ""sales funnel"" with several options. Here's how it breaks down:

1. **Front-End (Reseller License)**: $9 + Dimesale 
   * This is the basic version of the software with reseller rights.
   * There's a ""scarcity"" element here – this price is only available for 3 days. After that, it jumps to $14.
2. **Pro Version (Including Resale Rights)**: $14 - $18 
   * This likely includes additional features or benefits over the basic version.
3. **Master Resale Rights (MRR)**: $16 - $22 
   * This allows you to not only use the software but also sell it and keep 100% of the profits.
4. **White Label Rights**: $26 - $32 
   * With this, you can rebrand the software as your own product.
5. **Extra App with Resale Rights + White Label**: $34 - $42 
   * This includes an additional application along with resale and white label rights.
6. **Extra Apps with Resale Rights + White Label**: $44 - $94 
   * Multiple additional applications with full rights.

It's worth noting that the creator mentions this funnel might be modified at any time, so these prices could change.

My take on this? The front-end offer at $9 is pretty reasonable if you just want to create puzzles for your own books. If you're thinking of selling the software itself, the MRR or White Label options might be worth considering. Just remember to factor in your marketing costs if you go that route.

# Pros and Cons of Azon Word Hunt Maker

Like any product, Azon Word Hunt Maker has its strengths and weaknesses. Here's my honest take on the pros and cons:

# Pros:

1. **Speed**: The ability to create puzzles in seconds is a huge time-saver. 
2. **Ease of Use**: The interface is described as beginner-friendly, making it accessible to almost anyone. 
3. **Large Word Database**: With over a million words available, you're unlikely to run out of content for your puzzles. 
4. **Automatic Solution Generation**: This saves you from having to create answer keys manually. 
5. **Versatility**: You can create puzzles for various purposes – books, marketing materials, educational resources, etc. 
6. **Resale Rights**: The option to sell the software itself opens up additional income opportunities. 
7. **Low Initial Investment**: The front-end price of $9 makes it accessible to most people. 

# Cons:

1. **Windows Only**: If you're a Mac user, you're out of luck unless you have a Windows emulator. 
2. **Limited Customization**: While the software offers some customization, it may not be as flexible as creating puzzles manually. 
3. **Potential Market Saturation**: If lots of people start using this to create puzzle books, the market could become crowded. 
4. **Dependence on Software**: If you rely solely on this for your puzzle creation, you might be in trouble if the software ever becomes unavailable. 
5. **Upsells**: While the initial price is low, the full suite of features and rights comes at a higher cost through upsells. 
6. **Learning Curve**: While it's described as easy to use, there may still be a learning curve for some users. 
7. **Limited to Word Searches**: If you want to create other types of puzzles, you'll need different software. 

# How Azon Word Hunt Maker Dominates the Competition

In the world of puzzle-making software, Azon Word Hunt Maker stands out in a few key ways:

1. **Speed**: Many competitors require multiple steps to create a puzzle. Azon Word Hunt Maker does it with one click. 
2. **Price Point**: At $9 for the basic version, it's more affordable than many alternatives. 
3. **Word Database**: The million-word database is larger than what many competitors offer. 
4. **Resale Rights**: Not many puzzle-making tools come with the option to resell the software itself. 
5. **Focus on Amazon**: While you can use the puzzles anywhere, it's specifically designed with Amazon sellers in mind. 
6. **Simplicity**: Many competitors try to do too much, resulting in complex interfaces. Azon Word Hunt Maker keeps it simple. 
7. **Instant Solutions**: The automatic generation of puzzle solutions is a feature not all competitors offer. 

While it may not have all the bells and whistles of some high-end puzzle software, Azon Word Hunt Maker hits the sweet spot of functionality, ease of use, and affordability that many users are looking for.

# Azon Word Hunt Maker Money-Back Policy

When it comes to the money-back guarantee, Azon Word Hunt Maker offers a 15-day refund policy. However, it's important to note that this isn't a no-questions-asked guarantee. Refunds are only offered for technical reasons – specifically, if there are technical issues that the support team can't resolve.

This policy suggests that the creator is confident in the product's functionality. They're essentially saying, ""If it doesn't work as described due to technical issues, we'll give you your money back."" However, if you simply change your mind or find that the software doesn't meet your specific needs, you might not be eligible for a refund.

My advice? Make sure you're comfortable with this policy before purchasing. If you're on the fence, you might want to start with the basic version rather than investing in the higher-tier options right away.

# Azon Word Hunt Maker Price

Let's break down the pricing structure for Azon Word Hunt Maker:

1. **Front-End (Basic Version)**: $9 
   * This is the entry-level price, available for the first 3 days of launch.
   * After 3 days, the price increases to $14.
2. **Pro Version**: $14 - $18 
3. **Master Resale Rights**: $16 - $22 
4. **White Label Rights**: $26 - $32 
5. **Extra App with RR + WL**: $34 - $42 
6. **Extra Apps with RR + WL**: $44 - $94 

The exact prices within these ranges may vary based on when you purchase and any promotions running at the time.

Is it worth it? Well, that depends on your goals. If you're just looking to create a few puzzle books, the $9 front-end offer could be a great deal. If you're planning to resell the software or create a large number of books, the higher-tier options might be worth considering.

Remember, the time you save could be worth more than the cost of the software. If it takes 20 minutes to create a puzzle manually, and you're planning to make a 100-puzzle book, that's over 33 hours of work. Suddenly, even the higher-priced options start to look like a bargain!

# Azon Word Hunt Maker Bundle Deal

While there isn't a specific ""bundle deal"" mentioned in the provided information, the sales funnel itself acts as a kind of bundle. As you move up the tiers, you get more features and rights.

For example, if you opt for the ""Extra Apps with RR + WL"" option at $44 - $94, you're essentially getting a bundle that includes:

1. The basic Azon Word Hunt Maker software
2. Additional applications (though we don't have details on what these are)
3. Resale Rights (RR) for all included software
4. White Label (WL) rights for all included software

This top-tier option could be considered the ""ultimate bundle"" for someone who wants to not only create puzzle books but also sell the software itself under their own brand.

If you're serious about making this a business, this top-tier option might be worth considering. However, for most users, the front-end offer or Pro version will likely be sufficient.

# Who Created Azon Word Hunt Maker?

Azon Word Hunt Maker was created by D. Duarte. 

# When is Azon Word Hunt Maker Launched?

Azon Word Hunt Maker is set to launch on December 12, 2024, at 10:00 EST. This is a future date as of my last update in April 2024, so it's possible that this information is part of a pre-launch campaign.

The launch date is significant for a couple of reasons:

1. **Early Bird Pricing**: The front-end offer of $9 is only available for the first 3 days after launch. If you're interested in the product, you'll want to make your purchase during this window to get the best price. 
2. **Potential Updates**: Software often undergoes final tweaks and improvements right up to launch. By the time December 12, 2024 rolls around, the product might have additional features or improvements. 
3. **Support Readiness**: The launch date is when full customer support should be available. If you have any issues or questions, you should be able to get help starting from this date. 

Remember, in the world of digital products, launch dates can sometimes shift. It's a good idea to keep an eye out for any updates or announcements as the stated launch date approaches.

# Azon Word Hunt Maker Support

When it comes to support for Azon Word Hunt Maker, here's what we know:

* **Support Email**: diego@dominateit.com
* **Response Time**: The creator promises to get back to you within 2-10 hours (Monday to Friday)

This level of support is pretty standard for this type of software. A few things to note:

1. The support is via email only. There's no mention of phone support or a live chat option. 
2. The response time is only guaranteed on weekdays. If you have an issue over the weekend, you might need to wait until Monday for a response. 
3. The 2-10 hour response time is relatively quick for email support. Many similar products have longer wait times. 

Remember, the 15-day refund policy is tied to technical issues that support can't resolve. So if you do run into any problems, make sure to contact support promptly and keep a record of your communications.

My advice? If you purchase the software, send a test email to support right away. This will help you confirm that the support email is working and give you an idea of their actual response times.

The Windows-only nature of the software is something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing it. Make sure you have a compatible system before buying.

# Azon Word Hunt Maker Bonuses

When you purchase Azon Word Hunt Maker, you're not just getting the software. The creator has included some bonuses to sweeten the deal:

* Training videos
* Marketing materials
* Additional software tools
* PLR (Private Label Rights) content related to puzzle creation or Amazon selling

The inclusion of bonuses adds value to the package and can provide additional ways to make use of the software or build a business around it.

Remember, bonuses can often be as valuable (or sometimes even more valuable) than the main product itself, especially if they provide strategies for marketing or monetizing the software.

3. You're looking for a web-based tool that you can access from any device.
4. You're not interested in creating puzzle books or using word searches in your business.

Ultimately, the decision comes down to your specific needs and goals. If you're intrigued by the idea of quickly creating word search puzzles, whether for books, marketing materials, or other purposes, Azon Word Hunt Maker could be a valuable tool in your arsenal.

The low entry price of $9 for the basic version makes it a relatively low-risk investment. Even if you only use it to create a few puzzle books, you could potentially recoup your investment quickly.

However, if you're on the fence, remember that the price goes up after the first three days of launch. So if you're seriously considering it, it might be worth grabbing it at the lower price point.

As with any tool, the real value comes from how you use it. If you combine Azon Word Hunt Maker with some creative marketing strategies and consistent effort, it could potentially become a nice little side hustle or even a full-fledged business.

1hcutop,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1hcutop/what_might_have_caused_this_print_failure/,What might have caused this print failure?,"I try to solve these problems on my own, through reading this sub-Reddit and other web sites, but this one has me confused.

I am printing this coffee cup sleeve in ABS, as I wanted it to be able to tolerate the higher temperatures as well as be a bit more UV-resistant in case it's left inside a car.

It started out printing great. Fantastic adhesion (using the Bambu Lab textured PEI plate) and it was going well. But the moment it started with overhangs, it seems like they started to get really brittle, and started to collapse. I was watching, didn't see anything like the extruder colliding or anything like that. The pieces that were sticking out in the pictures, after the failure, were also incredibly brittle. I expect them to generally break off, but these required almost no pressure at all.

Of course, once the overhangs started to collapse, it was game over, and with nothing to print on, started to spaghetti. I am going to try printing again, but I'm not holding out much hope. I also have green PETG that I might try it with too, though for the aforementioned reasons, I was hoping ABS would work.

I'm running a Bambu Lab X1C with the stock 0.4 mm nozzle. I might try the full pile of calibration tests too, if I can't sort it out. I ran the filament in my filament dryer overnight before this print too.

I'm open to suggestions. :) Much appreciated!

1hcuruy,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1hcuruy/advice_for_an_applicant/,Advice for an applicant,"Hello everyone,
On 10 Dec, I applied online for a Barista position at a Starbucks location that is walking distance from where I live ( takes about 15 mins ). Since I moved to US only a few months ago and don't have a license yet, my options for job applications are limited to locations where I can walk to.

So today I went to the location and realised that it was a drive-thru and not a dine-in ( maps said otherwise ). I wanted to talk to the store manager to ask if the position was actually available and if my application had been received. This might sound really stupid, but I wasn't sure where the entry to the building was or how to approach the employees, so I stood and waited till the drive thru was clear and approached the window. An employee there told me to call on Monday around 2 pm to get a hold of the Stores Manager. She also asked me not to stand in the drive thru as it was a safety hazard ( I really wouldn't have if I knew another way ). 

Someone who's been through this, can you please tell me what would be the most appropriate way to go about this ? Should I wait and call on Monday? Or should I try to contact before that in some other way? Also, will the process of application be updated online? 
I really would like to work as a Barista because I absolutely love coffee (an avid black coffee person here) and being currently unemployed really will make me appreciate the pay. Thanks.

1hcuq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantsInTheUK/comments/1hcuq2y/terrified_by_landlord/,Terrified by landlord ,"I had a fantastic experience during my one-month stay with this maniac. I needed a place short-term, of course, with no paperwork done whatsoever—but okay. The room was stinking of smoke (and I am a smoker), with the smallest fridge ever, shared by four people. Plus, the landlord cooked and listened to loud Arabic music until 1 or 2 a.m. I suffer from insomnia, so that wasn’t a problem.

One night, I was on my way to have a cigarette outside and got caught up in an odd conversation. I found out from a guy, who probably sleeps in the gym, that he is “single but still married.” NOT that I asked anything. By the way, the guy was constantly in tracksuit bottoms, with no T-shirt, presumably to show off his muscles 🤢.

I got texts from him almost every day: Have you used my milk? Return the shower curtain exactly where it was. How much washing have you done? The door wasn’t closed properly. He would also clean the sink aggressively. I ended up eating and drinking my coffee outside the house whenever possible. I felt on edge and ready to leave at any moment.

A week in, I started getting no-ID calls from 12 to 3 or 4 a.m. every night. The music got louder too. He would have conversations with other tenants about me, leaving his door open for me to hear. I reported the calls to the police. Needless to say, they were useless.

Honestly, I started videoing any time I moved out of the room because I was getting scared. On one occasion, he questioned whose laundry I was doing and threatened to charge me extra. (For reference, the room was advertised as bills included.)
One night, I decided to pick up one of the calls. The maniac was pretending to be making a call while asleep. “Oh baby, baby” — sexy pep talk 🤢🤮. I immediately dialed 999, and he hung up right after. By week four, the calls had become routine. I got fed up and casually mentioned to him, “Don’t be alarmed if the police stop by. Someone keeps ringing me, and they will take my statement.”
The calls stopped that evening. I WAS LUCKY and afraid to consider what would have happened if I hadn’t had an option to leave. Be careful!",3,1734035922.0,TenantsInTheUK,2,0.81,False

1hcuolu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hcuolu/is_my_husband_cheating_on_me/,Is my husband cheating on me? ,"I don’t know how to handle this. 

Last year I found a mobile phone in my husbands bag, I was instantly suspicious, I put the sim in my phone and got the phone number. 

He called me in a panic asking if I had been in his bag as the phone was on, I panicked, played dumb and said no, he started going oh it’s my work phone - he had never mentioned it before and I thought okay, fair enough. 

I never saw that phone again. 

After that, I looked up the number on WhatsApp, it had disappearing WhatsApp status. 
The photo has changed regularly, one of them was a picture of his back in a place I didn’t recognise, it felt off. I checked recently and it is a picture of him and his friend, and to be honest, it’s a really good photo of him.

I believe the sim is now an eSIM, because the other phone is never around, and he has since lost his job (the company closed down). I know he uses the number because a couple of the status photos are of things I recognise, such as a picture of the hospital sign when he dropped me there, a photo of a coffee and bacon sandwich, I know it’s him as he sent me the same picture. 

I know if I ask him, he will deny it, he will double down and deny it completely. 

The reason I am also suspicious is because I am chronically ill, I am in bed sick a lot, and a month or two ago he told me he was getting unhappy because we don’t have s*x anymore.

What do I do? I don’t know the pin to his phone so I don’t know how to check. 

My gut feeling is that it’s not innocent, but I don’t know what to do.

**Sip of a Celestial God:**


Crafted by means no creature alive or dead is aware of. 

Being filled with a liquid so precious, that innumerable souls have given of themselves freely in the pursuit of it. 

With a glow that can be felt more than seen & an aroma that can ensnare the dead and awaken Azathoth. 


The Sip, is said to be the physical representation of coronal mass ejections, solar storms & the volcanic rage of a dying core. 

The Sip, is also said to be filled to the brim with a liquid so pure, and so powerful, that it would turn the drinker into a DemiMortal of incredible power and unlimited energy.


There was once a being, held firmly in the grasp of a drug induced euphoria, that became the first recipient of The Sip. It is said; this individual once came across a band of traveling merchants that were being accosted on their way to hawk their wares.

The only recorded information about the situation is a single piece of paper with a single sentence:


*""in that moment, it was as if a cracked planets core had taken on a physical form.""*


To this day, only an extremely limited number of beings have heard of, let alone consumed The Sip...

1hculpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/1hculpq/chris_wrays_resignation_is_bad_for_kash_patel/,Chris Wray’s resignation is bad for Kash Patel,"There’s a lot of gnashing of teeth going on about Chris Wray’s announcement that he plans to resign at the end of Biden’s term. I think that consternation is misguided, and he is actually fucking over Kash Patel and Trump by resigning, rather than rolling over for them as everyone is claiming. 

I think it’s gotta be a given that the Republican Senate has to take at least one scalp out of the motley crew that Trump is nominating to Senate confirmed positions. Since our society has the memory of a goldfish, Matt Gaetz isn’t gonna count as that scalp, and Pete Hegseth looks like he’s been dosing their coffee with Love Potion No. 9 and may manage to squeak through somehow. This would put Kash Patel, IMO, at the top (bottom?) of the scalp-taking pecking order (Kennedy and Gabbard are both too high-profile for them to shoot down; Patel is an anonymous gremlin in comparison).

Were Wray to remain in office, Patel could be appointed to a non-confirmed position in the FBI, and when he is eventually fired and Patel’s nomination is rejected by the Senate, Trump could simply appoint him “acting” FBI director under the Federal Vacancies Act. However that provision requires that Patel be serving in the agency to which he is being appointed head of for 90 days before the vacancy exists.

By resigning before Patel is given a position in the FBI, Wray is going to require Trump to nominate Kash Patel to the Senate, see that nomination rejected, then nominate someone else who can get confirmed, then hire Patel to a lower level FBI role, then fire the guy he just got confirmed, and only then be able to appoint Patel as acting director.

A Filipino Engineer's Perspective","So, I’m sitting in my Seattle apartment, enjoying a cup of coffee, when I see the news about these drones flying around New Jersey.  It’s crazy, right?  I’ve always been fascinated by drones.  I even built a few myself back in the Philippines.  But these drones in New Jersey?  They’re big, and they’re mysterious.  They’re not the kind of drones you’d expect to see hovering over a military base.  

You see, my name is Ermenildo Valdez Castro, Jr.  Everyone calls me Ernie.  But back home, I’m known as Ermenildo Castro, or Ermenildo V Castro, depending on who you ask.  I’ve always been fascinated by technology, and I’ve always wanted to make a difference in the world. That’s why I worked at companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Zulily.  I’ve seen how technology can be used for good, but I’ve also seen how it can be used for bad.  

And that’s what makes these drones so scary.  They could be used for surveillance, for spying, or even for attacks.  It’s a real concern.  As a veteran engineer, I know the capabilities of drones.  These drones are not your typical hobbyist drone.  They’re big, they’re powerful, and they’re capable of a lot of damage.  

Now, Congressman Jeff Van Drew thinks these drones are from a mothership, maybe from Iran.  But the Pentagon says no way, man, there’s no mothership.  And Governor Murphy says we shouldn’t get all worked up about it.  He says, ‘Let’s not fear-monger.’  But you know what, Ernie Castro doesn’t fear-monger.  I’m a Filipino guy, I’ve seen my fair share of drama, but I also know when something’s not right.  

The Pentagon saying there’s no mothership?  It’s a bit fishy.  The drones are big, they’re powerful, they’re flying near military bases.  It’s not just a hobbyist drone, and I’m not saying there’s an Iranian mothership out there, but something’s not adding up.  And we need to get to the bottom of it.  This isn’t about being afraid, it’s about being informed.  It’s about understanding what’s happening.  We need to be careful, but we also need to be smart.  And that’s the Filipino way.  We’re always trying to find the balance, the right path.  And in this case, the right path is to stay informed and keep an eye on the sky.

I find I benefit a lot from having a structured schedule and planned activities throughout my days. For work, it’s not so bad. I have a general idea of what my day looks like and what I need to do. I rely a lot on deadline desperation, which is not ideal, but mostly works for me.

It’s the personal planning that I really struggle with.

Very rarely I’ll have days that I’m either in just the right mood or feeling desperate enough to schedule things out for myself. I’ll go into hyperfocus to plan a trip out of a need to get out or I’ll rely on signing up for a weekly activity so I only have to commit to it once. 

Planning a date with my boyfriend? Can’t do it. Going to coffee with friends? Only if they set it up. It’s starting to drive me nuts and impacts my relationships.

And those are the smaller plans. Life plans? Don’t even try. I just shut down. 

There are too many options, too many ways plans can fall through. Will I be up for it that day? Will I put in emotional effort only for another person to not be interested, making me feel worse? How do people even come up with things to do? Who even has the energy anyway?

If anyone has advice on how to plan life things, please help a lady out.

1hcuipe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BudgetAudiophile/comments/1hcuipe/my_personal_review_of_the_fosi_audio_mc331_hybrid/,My personal review of the Fosi Audio MC331 hybrid tube amplifier,"Disclaimer

I wrote this review as part of the Fosi Audio product tester program. I had the opportunity to try out the MC331 unit, provided by Fosi Audio with the expectation of sharing detailed and unbiased feedback. For transparency, I have no connections with Fosi Audio and I am writing this review purely for the enjoyment and information of fellow audio enthusiasts.

First Impressions

The MC331 arrived in a well-secured package, with all the parts resting neatly in their respective compartments.
Unboxing revealed the MC331 unit, a 24V power supply, a Bluetooth antenna, the remote control and a user manual. Assembling everything was straightforward: This was the first time I owned a vacuum tube product and I had no issues putting the tubes in their ports, as well as screwing in the protective tubes around them. I wore gloves when handling the tubes, in order not to get any stains on them.

Design, Features and Installation

The MC331 is a versatile 2-channel hybrid tube amplifier combined with a built-in DAC powered by two Texas Instruments TPA3255 chips and equipped with 5654W vacuum tubes. It offers a range of inputs including RCA, optical, USB, coaxial and Bluetooth, along with outputs for passive speakers, and a pre-out option for a subwoofer or additional amplifier.
The front of this compact device is quite pretty with an orange on/off volume knob that also serves for selecting inputs, bass and treble knobs, and an oldschool VU meter on the left that adds a little ""steampunk"" touch. I'm a visual person and I must say I enjoyed the orange glow it emanates in the dark.
One little issue I encountered were the very small binding port holes for the bare wire speaker cables. Now if you got the thin type they're fine, but the thicker type hardly fits in there, in this case I recommend banana plugs that go straight into the bigger ports. For review convenience I used those anyway and always had a flawless connection.
Connecting to different sound sources via cable or Bluetooth was easy and fast, the device was also immediately found by my desktop PCs via USB.

Performance and Sound

For my first listening session I took a little trip to the countryside where my trusted 90s system comprised of a Musical Fidelity B1 amp (a cult device for British Hifi enthusiasts) and my Mission 763 speakers are always waiting to bring joy to my ears. I was excited to find out how this little device would fare as part of my first Hifi system which I still hold dearly. I always found my Mission speakers to be perfectly well-rounded, so ideal speakers for testing in my opinion.
Going into the listening session I started out with some synthwave, perfectly aware that this might night be the most suitable music for a tube amp and the result was as expected: While the Fosi drove my speakers very confidently in general, the bass, although powerful, lacked the punch and precision needed to bring electronic music to life. I also thought the B1 delivered a little more crispness of the synths in direct comparison.
So after this admittedly unfair test I put on some music where the MC331 could really shine, and shine it did: First I put on some Johnny Cash and found his deep, resonant voice sounded rich and authentic, just right accompanied by the usual stripped-down instrumentation. Next I listened to various jazz songs and they revealed a smooth and natural tone, with nice detail and instrumental separation. 
While listening and playing around with the controls, I found a minor downside was the sensitivity of the treble and bass controls. Even small turns of the knob significantly affected the sound, making fine-tuning a bit of a challenge. However, once I found the ""sweet spot"" with the bass just slightly turned up, I found no need for further adjustments.
Next, I was interested in evaluating the Fosi's DAC/preamp qualities, so I changed up the setup a little: This time I connected an old DVD player with a digital coax out to the amp’s corresponding input, with the signal being fed into my B1 via pre-out and compared it to an old but solid Technics CD Player, also connected to the B1.
For an exact comparison I put Snoop Dogg's debut album in both players and did some extensive A/B testing. I included my mom as a second pair of ears this time and the result was interesting: While I really liked the smooth sound of the tubes wrapping Snoop’s trademark mellow voice and laid-back rap-style in a warm atmosphere, accompanied by the 70s-influenced funk synthesizers, my mom preferred the straightforward punch and directness that the Technics delivered. Now this proves that this is not a matter of good or bad, wrong or right, but of personal preference.

For my second listening session I decided to combine the Fosi with my modern speakers, namely the Rega Kyte. To me, they are the perfect all-round speakers for every day, balanced sound with no weakness. I compared the Fosi to the Rega io amp I usually pair them with.
I happened to drink my first coffee that day listening to some punk rock and I thought why not, let's give the tubes a shot at this. I would say the results were mixed, but enjoyable nonetheless: I felt it added a little grit and aggression to the driving guitars and angry vocals, though at the same time it might have added a little too much boominess to the bass and especially the kick drum, so I turned down the bass a little and was quite happy. A fun listen because of the overall energy and great dynamic range.
Then I decided to mix it up music-wise, and give the Fosi a chance to really excel, so I put on Miles Davis classic “Kind of Blue”. And what can I say, it delivered: Warmth and depth that makes the music feel immersive, with a wide and present soundstage. The subtle details of the brass, piano and drums really came to life and got me hooked. You know that moment when you start vibing and snapping your fingers with the rhythm? Then just melting away at the slower parts? I'm not a huge jazz listener usually, but here everything just came together. Just beautiful. I felt like the io was outperformed by a margin. 

Final Thoughts

The Fosi Audio MC331 hybrid tube amp really impresses with its warm, rich sound and beautiful vintage design. It's perfect for jazz, country and similar music, but I found it can also can bring a different vibe to diverse styles of music, from funk to punk. It might not be the top pick for electronic tunes because the bass isn't as snappy, but of course tube amps make up for this weakness with other strengths.

1hcufyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hcufyv/which_coffee_machine_to_buy/,Which coffee machine to buy?,"Hello,

I come with the following question - I'm looking for a coffee machine and I'm quite limited in terms of models (due to the fact that it's partly a gift card purchase) and I'm considering 3 models:

1. Siemens EQ.700 TP703R09, my favorite at the moment, but I was told it has very poor brewing unit
2. Nivona NIVO 8103, pretty but lacking in coffee types,  
3. Delonghi ECAM450.65.G.

They're all at a similar price (Nivona is a bit more expensive, but not by much). I know that these coffee machines are vastly different and Nivona only has 6 types of coffee, Siemens has a ceramic grinder and so on, but maybe any of you have some thoughts, especially on 1) and 3)?

Originally, I was thinking about Nivona, but I have doubts whether it's worth paying extra for it, since it has fewer coffees, no cold brew and at a higher price, rather poor screen compared to even much cheaper coffee machines - what is so extra in it that would justify the purchase? Can you add your own coffees to it? I looked in the manual and there's not much about the Own Coffee mode.

I'm also considering the Melitta Barista SE F830, but as a last resort, because even though I know it's a great coffee machine, I won't get any discount on it.

i had spilled an entire cup of coffee into the keyboard, so i removed all the keys to clean as much as i could (removing keys was the only option, as you have to rip the back off to access the board any other way). 

the keyboard works fine now, but the first 3 F keys are not clicking in place correctly, unlike all the other buttons. the retainer clips are different than the other keys too, as they seem to sit interwoven into each other, instead of clicking into each other like the other clips do. i spent over an hour just getting one of those clips back into position, unlike all the other clips, so i don't understand how to reassemble it. 

the clips and buttons are not broken, but the clips seem to be unique and correspond to the keys they attach to; all other clips seem identical to their similar keys. 

does anyone know how to replace these keys? do i have to place the clips into the key first? every other key just clips into the retainer clips.

  
any advise would be greatly appreciated; i've had this keyboard for years, so i would rather try to fix it than replace it (or do irreversible damage like just trying to glue the cap to the rubber switch and just toss the clips).

I've no idea if this is even the right sub for this, but i'm totally lost as to what's going on here. 

I'm a 38 year old guy, and i'm talking about a 32 year old woman. We met through work about 7 years ago. We dated a couple of times when we first me, i've always liked her and still do, but it sort of fizzled out and never went anywhere. We never slept with each other or had any sexual contact.

Anyway, that being said, she knows I still like her but I know it's not going to go anywhere other than friendship, we both know this and we've discussed it in the past a few years ago. That's fine with me, I'm more than happy to put any feelings aside and continue with a friendship. It's been a good one as such, we've never fallen out, make each other laugh and she's even told me several times that I'm on the same wavelength as her, and I'd be the first one she'd call if she was in a dire situation. She talks to me about work problems, things going on in her life etc and I do the same back with her.

We used to meet up for occasional coffee and a catchup, but I calculated it today and she hasn't seen me now for 3.5 years!

I know what you're thinking - She's too nice to bin you off, she's ghosting you, take the hint etc... Which I'll accept, however...

She stays in regular contact, and often is the one instigating it. If i've stepped away, and gone quiet for a couple of days, she'll text asking how I am and asks if I'm okay because I've gone quiet. She'll ring me regardless, usually one or twice a week on her way home from work for general chat and life updates. We're forever sending memes and funny things back and forth over social media. I'd go so far to say, that we have some sort of contact at least 4 or 5 days a week, and half the time she's the one that instigates it.

I've asked her a few times to meet up and catchup in person, she's either just ignored it for a couple of days then pretends I never asked, or she vaguely commits and ghosts me. She's done it today. I asked her yesterday if she fancied a coffee before Christmas, she replied saying she'll probably be able to do today, then blanked me all day (i never text her pushing the issue, thought i'd see if she reached out and she didn't).

Distance isn't an issue, she's not that busy, she's not got kids or a family or anything like that.

I totally understand, a woman will put distance between herself and a guy if she's not interested and I'll respect that, but we're good friends, speak all the time but for some reason she just will not commit to meeting up in person for some reason. Like I said, if I thought this was the case, I'd back away like I have done in the past, but then she's reaching out again checking in on me, messaging and calling me and essentially, being a good friend without ever seeing someone. I feel like a penpal and part of me just wants to cut off all contact because it's concerning me now, and this amount of time is excessive.

In terms of her relationship status, shes unmarried, she does have a boyfriend. I thought maybe he's some possessive jealous person who might get the wrong idea about me if she got seen with me, but she's only been with this guy for about 6 months. She was single for about 6 months before him, and before that she was with a guy for a couple of years who was fairly chill by all accounts. Even if she was somehow concerned this friendship would get in the way of her relationship or give the wrong impression, it doesn't explain the previous partner or the time period when she was single.

This is more friendship than relationship advice, but what's she playing at here and why? I'm wondering if im just some sort of emotional support sponge here and she's keeping me on tap for when she has a bad day, feeling down, or something goes wrong, but i've really no clue.

In my country (Chile) I really enjoy going out to places, I like bohemia and specialty coffee. I used to live in Valparaiso, so you can get an idea. I like live music shows, from classical and contemporary music to ska, punk, hardcore and black metal. No latin music, please lol.

Could you recommend any activities or places to meet people with similar tastes?

I would also like to know what is a not so expensive place to drink specialty coffee, since it is almost a daily activity for me.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else feels the same things I’ve been feeling lately. I’m going to turn 30 next year and I’m still a virgin. Personally, I don’t really care, I guess I’m more concerned about what other people think. I know I shouldn’t care about that either, but saying that is a lot easier than truly not giving a fuck.

As for why? All I can say is that it just hasn’t happened yet. I guess if I had to define my feelings about being a virgin it would just be a big shrug of my shoulders. The opportunity hasn’t really come up, and personally, I’ve never really been in a rush to get there. I’m generally a very laid back and chill kinda gal but I guess turning 30 is somewhat of a milestone and the fact that I still haven’t lost my v-card does kinda make me feel some typa way. I guess I’m wondering if anyone else can relate? I HATE dating and really the entire concept of it. Pretty much before every date I’ve ever been on, I’ve had full blown panic attacks. It’s just such a stress inducer ESPECIALLY when you’re a plus size woman. 

It’s also not that I haven’t had anyone interested, it’s just that typically I never get past the talking stage with a guy even if we’ve seen each other in person for coffee or something. I also have major trust issues which have recently gotten worse over the past two years due to my ex-best friend stabbing me in the back basically. I just don’t trust anyone, and truthfully, I guess that connection and bond you build with someone is just more important to me than most people. Not that I wouldn’t be open to casual sex, but with my anxiety surrounding stds, I do kinda feel like a monogamous relationship would probably be a better fit for me.

I also haven’t really felt the same attraction to the men that have shown interest in me and would potentially want to move past the talking stage, so at this point I’m really a virgin by choice simply because I just haven’t met anyone I’d be remotely interested in being intimate with, this is because of how much I hate the dating process. Can anybody relate to this? Just curious.

TLDR: I’ll be turning 30 next year and still haven’t lost my virginity. I have a bunch of mixed feelings about it.",3,1734034400.0,virgin,1,1.0,False
