1gmm3l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shiftingrealities/comments/1gmm3l5/trouble_with_falling_asleep/,Trouble with falling asleep...,"I need some advice...

Does anyone else has trouble with falling asleep during the method? I mini shifted once a few years ago, the thing that brought me back was because I wasn't grounded on my DR yet, fell asleep while almost fully shifting and woke up in my OR...

So, I tried a lot of different methods, closer to shift with some, tried a bit of the gateway tapes but they confused me a lot (adhd and not great at visualizing) and now I decided to try yoga nidra

The thing is... during all the methods, gateway tapes and yoga nidra I keep falling asleep, the few times I didn't it's because I couldn't concentrate at all. I tried shifting while sitting down but then I don't get even close to relaxing my body enough, I also tried sleep methods and they worked even less than awake/sat down methods

Anyone has any tips or advice? I tried drinking coffee before a method once, my body got too jittery and my mind was unfocused, and it wasn't a very pleasant experience overall but maybe I could try again? And see if it works this time... but I'm not so confident on the coffee helping",1,1731082174.0,shiftingrealities,1,1.0,False

1gmm32p,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gmm32p/i_was_catfished/,I was catfished ,"Few years back I had been having a decent back and forth with a guy. I'd been playing the long game with. He was cute af, seemed remarkably stable (I was 22 at the time, his profile said 24) for a guy on grindr and had all the right things going on. About a month into conversation we finally decided to meet up. We organised to meet at a cafe and have coffee.

To say I was keen to meet this guy was an understatement, I’d developed a crush on him and spent far too long on making myself look good. Date time rolled around and I showed up at the cafe a little early to scope the situation out etc. I got a message from him shortly after saying he was having car trouble and asked if I minded coming to his so we didn't have to bail on the date. I (rather stupidly) didn't see the issue here and went off to his place, it was only a few blocks over.

I got there, knocked on the door and was greeted by a guy in his early 50s.

""hey.... is C (him) here?"" I asked assuming this must be the guy's father.

""you're looking at him. Hello J (me), it's nice to meet you in person finally"" he said with what looked like a slight smirk

My world spun. A guy old enough to be my father had catfished me? He had spent a MONTH creating a young persona to... I didn't even know... lure me into meeting him? What the fuck was going on?!

He invited me in and I just stood there, gobsmacked. Then I heard a voice from inside the house call out

""C, is that J at the door?""

Another guy in his 50s appeared at the door and looked me in the eye and then looked me up and down. He made some kind of comment about me looking better in the flesh and encouraged me inside. I’m still stunned, practically open mouth shock at whatever the hell is going on and am now trying to plan my getaway in my head. I decided to just excuse myself back to my car politely.

They tried to insist I come in and we could get to know one another and I kinda blew up. I remember calling them “creepy fucks” and that they “epitomised all the dark shit people thought about gay men” and then I just ran back to my car and drove off. Didn’t even look back.

My entire drive home I was shaking, To this day, I still don’t understand what the fuck they thought was going to happen after I showed up, but I’ll never understand how anyone could see this kinda thing as acceptable in the slightest.",1,1731082138.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1gmm1bi,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1gmm1bi/finally_got_under_100_first_time_in_about_8_years/,Finally got under 100! First time in about 8 years! ,"I started exercising a lot since last year. I hike, do mountaineering and go the gym. Despite this I found myself at my heaviest ever this past August where I measured 110kg (I actually measured 112kg initially but I happened to have 2kg of poop inside me at that time lol). 

Frustrated with myself, I though it was stupid that I was gaining so much weight despite being in the most physically active era of my life. And so I decided that enough was enough, and thus I finally started being serious about weight loss. 16-8 fasting combined with calorie counting was all I needed to get me going. 

At first progress, was slow, but after a month of weight loss I started seeing the larger trend in my chart; and now I see a very clearly defined trendline. I hope to finish the year by or under 95kg and finally stop classifying as obese after a decade of being so, my long term goal is a ""normal"" BMI (80kg) by April in my birthday. 

At this point, I don´t even understand what I was eating to gain so much weight, my TDEE was 2,500 at sedentary, more like 3,400 counting all the exercise I do, its ridiculous. I aim to eat 1,600 calories on a normal day, and 2,500 worth of food seems like so much now. Even getting my daily mocha coffee with a cookie doesn´t work so hard against my weight goals. 

Unfortunately, I don´t feel I have as many looks gains so far, at least from my perspective. In the mirror I look the same to me, however touching myself helps me notice the changes. My double chin is smaller, the back portion of my love tires is starting to dissipate, the fat under my armpits is largely reduced, my belly feels somewhat smaller. But more importantly, old clothes have either starting to fit me again, or fit me better again. This last part is such a confidence booster, even if I myself can´t see changes in the mirror just yet. 

Anyways, not so sure how to end this so I just will. I hope someone manages to feel inspired by this because if I can do it, you can! ",1,1731082009.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

We don’t message outside of work obviously, but we cut up at work sometimes/joke around/etc. He has really done a lot to teach me and help me where I work, always super patient, gone out of his way to help, etc. I know it’s just his job but I wanted to give him a little something to show I appreciate him. Not much obviously, just a small coffee gift card and leave it at that. Gift giving is my love language so I love giving for friends.

However, like I said, I don’t want to be weird. Like, stepping out of line weird. He’s a grown ass man, I’m a young woman that’s almost half is age. So that aspect. I don’t think he’d think I’m trying to get in his pants since he knows I’m getting married and we work in a religious workplace, and I’ve never gave him any indication I’m attracted to him…but you never know.

I’m not too worried about him thinking I’m trying to kiss ass at work. He’s the boss of only me and one other person, and this other person is also a grown man. They see each other more anyways (I work an hour away) and their kids are friends.

Also keep in mind I am a CHRONIC overthinker and 10000% am overthinking this very small act.

1gmlve9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1gmlve9/my_elderly_neighbor_insists_she_is_pregnant/,My Elderly Neighbor Insists She Is Pregnant,"I spit out my coffee, thinking that it must have been a joke. But she stared at me with not even a hint of amusement on her face. 

Deb and her husband had mostly kept to themselves. But when her husband died 3 months ago, Deb started visiting often.

“Chuck and I were very physical, right up until he died,” she winked. “God sent me his child so he can continue to be with me.”

“Haven’t you gone through menopause?”

“I know it is hard for you to understand, but this is the work of God. Chuck and I always wanted a child, but we could never get pregnant. It’s a true miracle”

I told myself that this was her way of coping, so I decided to play along. 

Then Deb started using her “pregnancy” to gain favors. She needed help with chores and errands because the pregnancy was “draining her.” I figured I was helping to ease some of her grief, but after a while, I knew she was taking advantage of me. 

One morning she came over at 5:00 am. 

“Baby has me up early these days! I’m starving. Could you help me with breakfast?”

“Enough, Deb! You’re not pregnant.”

“How dare you! You’re wrong!”

Two months passed before I ran into her again. My mouth dropped at the sight of her. Her previously loose-fitting cardigan could barely stretch around her stomach. When she saw me looking at her belly, she smirked.

“Told you I was pregnant! Chuck Jr. is growing at a healthy rate, no thanks to you.”

She must have stuffed her sweater with something. 

“Can I feel?”

“Keep your hands off of me!” 

I laughed and walked away. Clearly, she didn’t want me to feel whatever she had stuck under her clothes. 

Three months later, she knocked on my door. I wanted to roll my eyes at the sight of her. Her “pregnant” belly had doubled in size. 

“The doctor insists I bring someone to my appointment. You’re the only person I know around here.”

My instinct was to decline, but then I realized this would finally force her to drop the act. When we arrived at the doctor’s office, the nurse asked me to exit the room and led me down the hall where the doctor was waiting.

“Sarah, I wanted to speak with you alone. Deborah has been under my care, and I’ve asked her to bring in a family member several times. She believes that she is pregnant, and we need help handling this.”

“What she needs is some psychiatric help, and for someone to tell her to stop stuffing her shirt to fake being pregnant!”

“The thing is Sarah, she is not faking that part. It does appear her husband’s death may have sparked some type of psychosis, but her abdomen truly is the size of a third term pregnancy.” 

He paused. 

“It’s fluid build-up. From stage 4 ovarian cancer. She has less than six months to live.”

1gmltoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gmltoc/talking_to_strangers/,Talking to Strangers,"I guess by now that you know that I'm an introvert. And I'm pretty sure you're empathetic enough and have enough social awareness to know that that just means I need to recharge sometimes, not that I don't like being around people. True, I can be shy when the stakes are high. And I guess the fact that I don't really open up to people until I'm comfortable with them makes me a bit reserved.

But I *love* people, and I *love* to chat. Sure, I rarely initiate, but if the service manager at the auto shop asks me about the clay mug I'm drinking my coffee from, well, then I'm gonna start chatting with him.

And, honestly, getting drawn into conversations with people I wouldn't ever talk to on my own is on the very long list of things I look forward to in our future relationship. On my own, I would probably *never* go and introduce myself to the band after a show, but in truth I would *love* to, so the fact that you *would* and *do*…

Gosh, that is *incredibly* attractive to me.

Also, side note: you have, since the day we met, had a remarkable (and thus far in my life unique) ability to recharge me on-the-go. I haven't *ever* run out of social energy when you've been around. I used this analogy for a very different kind of thing a few months ago (…ahem…), but you're like a portable charger for me, always somehow keeping my energy topped off, with no special effort on your part. It's… amazing, like the rest of you. But I digress…

Anyways. All of this is to say, there was one of those videos I usually scroll past on FB the other day… I mean, I don't need to know the ten signs a woman is attracted to you or whatever… the way your eyes burn into mine sometimes tells the whole entire story. But, this one was different: 7 signs an introvert likes you. Well. I already know the things *you* do that let me know that you like me, but what about you? What signals am *I* giving off? Anyways, it sparked my curiosity, but I really didn't want to feed the algorithm, so I searched for it in an incognito tab and found the same video on youtube. So… what are those signs? And am I doing them? Hmmm… let's find out…

1. They make an effort to spend one on one time with you. Well. This one is difficult. I would *absolutely* do this, but it's hard, as I know you know. But the rare times we have had to ourselves, I will forever treasure and cherish. The video does call out taking walks together, or inviting you to coffee, both of which are things I've even written about here… so, yeah, I haven't really done this but I *want to* so, so badly… anyways, onwards…
1. They open up about personal things. Yeah, I don't know if you've caught on to this yet, but I am an open book to you. I don't always volunteer things of my own accord (though, sometimes I do…), but I would answer any question you ever ask. Seriously, anything. I imagine you could even break down all of the walls between us in seconds with just the right question, if you wanted to… There is truly no one else in this world that I feel safer opening up to than you.
1. They initiate contact, even if it's subtle. Hey! I got this one! Not every day, but more and more often as time goes on. I imagine I'm not the only person you send random stuff to on Facebook (though, I also imagine the ones for me are more meaningful than anything you send others… probably?), but *you* are the only person *I* send stuff to. Lucky you, eh?
1. They remember the little things you say. Pretty sure I've got this one, too, though I guess I'd have to ask you whether I demonstrate it enough or not. I mean, look… my memory is… wishy-washy sometimes, but there seems to be a compartment set aside somewhere in my brain for my interactions with you, even the ones from long before I fell completely in love with you (we never did get together to play Scene It?, btw… though more recently, we have had some excellent game nights!). Anyways, if you said it, there's a pretty good chance Mr. Cool Cap remembers it. But, gosh, just wish I could remember whether it was Hot Tamales you said you like, or Red Hots………
1. They let you see their quiet side. Well, like the one-on-one time, this one is sort of situational and difficult for us to achieve at the moment. But, just as I'm looking forward to chatting with you *endlessly*, I also just cannot wait for just… like… companionship time. Sitting quietly by the campfire together. Snuggled on the couch reading books. Watching the waves roll in. *Any* time spent with you is magical, to me.
1. They subtly include you in their inner circle. Um. Well. Truth is, I don't have an inner circle, at least not locally. Or, I didn't anyways, not until the past couple of years… but it was more that I've started getting drawn into yours than the other way around. But, look… if somehow we had all met each other in my hometown, and I still hung out with all my old high school buddies, then I absolutely, 100% would have brought you around to spend time with them. And they would adore you, I'm sure of it.
1. They're patient and supportive of your needs. Patient, yes. Lol. I'm pretty sure I have infinite patience when it comes to you. And I guess this is another one we'd have to ask you about, but I absolutely do try to be supportive. All I want to do is support you, in whatever way you need at any given time. I want to be reliable for you, be your rock. I just want to always be there for you… and I *am*, even if our situation makes it awkward, or difficult sometimes.

My gosh, this went on *far* longer than I intended, lol. And, after doing a deep dive into it, I'm pretty sure these are all just signs that *anyone* likes you, introvert or otherwise. After all, *you* do *all* of these things for me, and while I could be wrong, I'm pretty sure you're an extrovert\*. But, maybe it's a matter of relative significance… or maybe it's all pop-psych garbage in a poorly-produced, probably-AI-generated video. 🤷‍♂️

Still, *I* thought it was an interesting thought exercise. Then again, one of my favorite recent FB group finds is the Dull Men's Club… but, hey, you've sent me posts from that group before, so………

Anyhow. Babe, I love you. Sorry, this was a long read. What can I say? Work is slow this morning.

Hope you have a day that's as beautiful as you are!

Yours.

\* I don't think I ever posted it here, but I wrote something — an essay, really, lol — about how I think you're likely an ENFJ. I still think so, even after getting so much closer to you over the past year, though I do allow that I may be wrong. And I promise I don't *only* think so because ENFJ and INFP are supposed to be remarkably compatible. Not to mention make for incredible lovers… ahem.

We moved pretty quickly and even on our first date, it felt like I was spending time with someone I’ve known for a long time. Everything was going well for the most part - I met her family and friends and she met mine. We experienced a lot together in that period of time.

There were some things that she did that would annoy me and I’ll admit that I never communicated those things as they were just who she was and her ADHD. I’ll give some examples:

- She did not have her own bank account at 21 (uses her dad’s credit card) and had no sense of financial literacy even though I tried a few times to educate her and also offered to help her with any questions if she ever had any. 
- Whenever she would do laundry, she would have to dedicate her time to only that otherwise she would get distracted and forget about it. It would take her several days to do laundry because she would always forget a load is in the washer or dryer. 
- Her room was always messy with clothes on the ground
- There were times where she just wasn’t smart due to a lack of common sense at times. 
- She’s still in her sophomore year of college meanwhile I’ve been graduated for two years and have a job.
- She would forget to text me back for a few hours sometimes even if she was on her phone when I texted her. She said it was her ADHD that would make her forget. I did communicate that bothered me early into the relationship and I did compromise by texting her again if she hadn’t replied in a timely matter.

A few months into our relationship I started having doubts sometimes because I wasn’t sure if I could see a future with those things that would not change. But I had a lot of love for her, even if I wasn’t in love, and cared about her so much. Sometimes I would seem a little distant due to my depression and anxiety and I did try communicating better with her on that, but maybe it wasn’t enough. 

Anyways fast forward to last week, we went to dinner and I mentioned our 6 month anniversary that was coming up and that I wanted to take her out to a new place I thought she’d like. During that dinner and after when we went to hang out at my place, she seemed distant. Since that day, I had a gut feeling something was off as her communication style changed. I did try asking her a few times in the remainder of the week about how she was. She was telling me she was depressed and that it was seasonal depression, and also she was stressed with school.

I thought we were okay. She asked me when the next time I was free was and we set up a day to hang out. My gut was telling me something was wrong and I was overthinking the worst for days. But I was right.

She came over to my place crying. We sat down and she told me that she was thinking for the past week and she said she hadn’t felt the way she wanted to at this point of our relationship. Her feelings weren’t growing and it wasn’t something that I did or she did. I was just so shocked. She told me I was a really good person and deserve the best. She also said that we should go no contact for a few months and then maybe get coffee and catch up.

This hurt me so much. This was my first amicable breakup and even though it happened 4 days ago, it still hurts.

I did something unhealthy last night and stalked her social media and one of them consisted of a Twitter account that she’s shown me on her phone a few times but she didn’t think I would actually be looking at her Twitter account on my own since I don’t have Twitter. I saw that she had a post where she was in one of her college classes and she was supposed to write down qualities she wants in a partner and then she also put “POV me right after a breakup” with a picture of a paper that only had one quality written down “someone who can communicate”.

I can’t tell if she just lied to me when she was breaking up because if my poor communication was what caused her to lose feelings or/and not want to continue our relationship, she never said that. 

Even if I didn’t see a future for us romantically, I still wanted her in my life which is probably why I kept the relationship going. Hopefully we can be friends after no contact.

Sorry for the long post but I would appreciate any thoughts that you all have. Thank you ",1,1731081227.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

1gmlog2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MythosIndustries/comments/1gmlog2/illyria_25/,Illyria 25,"I wake up. It’s been two days since the death of Tock. I spent all day yesterday hungover. I go downstairs and make my iced coffee. From the kitchen I hear Maddy exclaim.
“No thank you.”

I walk into the office and see Maddy and Gor fighting over some papers.

“What’s going on?” I ask.

“My assistant is being a turd.” Maddy answers.

Gor swipes and takes a piece of paper. Maddy grabs it and there is a bit of tug of war. I walk over and lean against the desk and look down.
“Little early to be messing with Maddy, isn’t?

Gor grumbles.

I look at Maddy.
“He says you’re not arranging the papers properly.”

Maddy gasps.
“How dare you, mister.”

For whatever reason. Gor loves to pester Maddy. I think she is his favorite and I believe the feeling is mutual.

“Is this going to be a thing or am I going to have to separate you two?” I ask.

Gor grumbles.

“Fire Maddy and have you do all of this? I don’t know about all that.”

“You little shit. Get out of my office.” Maddy says before playfully smacking him on his ass.
“Get out of here.” Maddy says before smacking him on the ass again.

Gor walks out of the office laughing.

“Pestering you?” I ask.

“It’s the highlight of my day. What’s up?”

“Still recovering. Glad the Lobos have been taken care of.”

“You ok?” Maddy asks.

I sigh before taking a sip of my coffee.
“I will be. It’s s a heavy thing being involved in a persons death like that.” 

“It would have to be. Normally I would give you a job to get your mind off of it but I don’t have anything at the moment.”

I take a sip as I think.
“Good.”

“What?”

I lean forward.
“Good. I say today we have a team building exercise.”

“What does that mean?” Maddy asks.

I sit down and throw an arm on the back of the couch.
“All day we all hang out. I say we get dinner and have a small get together, just us.”

“You want to throw a party already? Your body up for that?”

I snort.
“A laid back get together. Like a pizza party or something.”

Now Maddy leans back and folds her arms.
“So who’s going to be at this team building?”

“Me, you, Holden and Aurora.”

“Me?” Maddy asks.

“Of course you. You are the beating heart of the outfit. We all depend on you.” I state.

“About time I get recognized.”

I smile.
“That’s the spirit. You in?”

Now Maddy smiles.
“Ok. Dinner at Esmeralda’s?”

“That’s works. I happen to know one of the owners. Plus the food is excellent.”

“I’ll make the reservations. You call everybody else.”

I stand.
“Hope you got a bathing suit here. There’s going to be some serious pool time before dinner.”

“Deal.”

I walk out to the guesthouse and knock on the door. Holden answers.
“What are you doing today? Doesn’t matter. We are hanging out today. All of us.”

“That’s cool. I have nothing pressing today.”

“Pool party starts in about a hour.”

Holden nods and shuts the door. As I walk, I pull out my phone and text Aurora and letting her know what’s going on today. She hits me back in a few minutes and says she is in her way. Ok, the only thing to do now is get dressed. I make final preparations by getting all the booze together. A small bikini later and I’m ready. I sit in the shallow end of the pool and light a blunt. Maddy walks out in a tasteful one piece.
“Margarita stuff is over there.” I say.

“Don’t mind if I do.” Maddy says as she walks over.

The kids run out of the guesthouse and jump into the deep end. Holden walks out and sits next to me.
“They swim?” I ask.

“They are quite good at it.”

“Want a margarita?” I ask.

“You mean a girly drink?”

“A frozen, refreshing fruit beverage.” I correct.

“Maybe later.”

Twenty minutes later Aurora shows up in full goth pinup mode. Huge, wide hat, sunglasses and her black thong bikini that covers her nipples and that’s about it. Scorn lands on the water and starts swimming with the kids. For being the size of a kitten. He’s quite good at it.

“About time you showed up.” I say.

“One should always be fashionably late to a party.” She answers.

Now that everyone is here. The team building exercise can start. Aurora lights a cigarette and asks Maddy.
“Anything in the horizon?”

“Not today. I like your swimsuit.”

“Yours is cute as well.”

We spend the afternoon just hanging out. As it nears late afternoon. We change clothes for dinner. Before we leave. Holden pulls Lilith aside.
“Watch Fang. This is a lot of responsibility and I think you’re ready. You good?”

Lilith nods.

“Ok. You two stay out of trouble. We will be back soon.”

Holden rides his bike as the rest of us hop into Jolene. Soon enough we arrive at Esmeralda’s and are escorted to mom’s booth. We place our orders and as usual the food was excellent. As we walk out, Maddy looks at us.
“Should we go to the farmers market?”

“Good idea.” Holden says.

We start walking. As we pass city hall, we see people outside.

“What’s this?” Aurora ask.

“Town hall meeting. Usually there isn’t this many people. Something is up.” Maddy says.

We walk into city hall. The town council room is filled to the gills. Standing in front of the town council is a woman named Tiffany. She’s crossed paths with mom a couple of times. I find her to be unpleasant. She is raising hell at the podium.
“We all know the goings on around here. Faust has brought darkness to our town and homes. Our city has been under attack for years now.”

“Excuse me.” I say as I walk to the front.

Tiffany points at me.
“Your mom has brought the darkness here. She must be kicked out. The mayor can’t allow this to go on.”

“My mom came after the darkness. She has kept it at bay.” I counter.

“We wouldn’t need her if the whole world knew.” Tiffany says. She is backed up by a couple of people on the council.

“No. How do you think the world would react to knowing the darkness existing? Our city doesn’t handle it well. That’s why we have a network of similar towns that help each other.”

“We could do better and have the military and complies help.”

“The military and the federal government would lock everything down if not have us removed. We would be living in a police state. The companies are already here trying to profit from all of this. They kidnapped people and were doing illegal  and inhuman experiments on them.”
I slowly walk down the middle aisle then I stop and look at Tiffany.
“That the companies you want here. So they can do shady shit for their bottom line?”

“Not all companies are like that.” Tiffany says.

“Too many for sure. Lord knows what the government would do.”

“The government is by the people and for the people. They have our best interests at heart.”

“Do they? Seems to me they would try and weaponize werewolves or something.” I say.

“Fuck the werewolves. They are inhuman. I say if the government can use them to keep our country safe. They should weaponize them.”

The crowd has no become silent. Out of the corner of my eye I see Holden tense up. I slightly shake my head at him. I turn my attention back to Tiffany.
“How dare you. Werewolves have fought with my mom to keep the darkness away. They have died defending this town. Witches have fought for this town too.”

Tiffany looks shocked.
“Are you confirming the existence of witches?”

“I am. Leprechauns, fairies, gargoyles and vampires exist as well. They too have defended this city.But let’s not bullshit ourselves here. On some level you all knew that.”

I start walking through the crowd.
“How dare any of you co sign on Tiffany’s bullshit. People and creatures have died defending this town. All of you owe your lives to mom and them. Have all of you forgot when gangs teamed up with witches and started some shit? How about when the supernatural clowns attacked or when the sky turned red? All of you lived to see the next sunrise because of her and her friends. Who could’ve stopped all that much less knew what was going on?”

Some people lower their heads while others nod.

“Your mother is the reason the darkness is here. She is the reason all of this has happened. We need outside help to deal with this,” Tiffany says.

“No. We need to come together like never before. Read our town’s history. Darkness has been here since day one. Way, way before my mom. Without her, things would be way, way worse. Look at Oakmill. Mom doesn’t live there and look at it now. It’s destroyed basically, my mom has never asked for your thanks. But she does expect your respect and to stay out of her way.”

Tiffany puts her hands on her hips.
“Speaking of your mom. Where is she! Nobody has seen her in months.”

“She’s away on business.”

“If she is so important to this town. Why did she leave?” Tiffany asks.

“Whatever business she is on. It’s no doubt for the greater good.”

Tiffany folds her arms.
“So who’s protecting the town now?”

This is put up or shut up time.

“Me. In my mother’s absence, I’m protecting the town.”

Tiffany scoffs.
“Some college age girl is defending us? What a twisted joke. I don’t know about all of you but I would feel safer seeing uniformed soldiers on every street corner.”

Some people in the room now in agreement.

“That’s facist. Soldiers on every street corner. People exhausted and stressed for just existing. You would also limit speech and thought. What you’re proposing is the hallmarks of a dictatorship.”

“But we would be safe.” Tiffany counters.

“We would be under a thumb we would never get out from under. Listen, what we are doing is working. We have support from towns like us. We are not alone. We keep the world safe and in the dark. Trust the process, please.”

“We have trusted long enough. Now we demand results. Mayor, what are your thoughts on this?”

The mayor adjusts his tie.
“Both sides have made a good argument. I believe the right corse of action right now is to table this for a couple of months. We can pick this back up when passions are cooled. It will also give everyone time to think hard about all of this. This town council meeting is adjourned.”

And with that he brings the gavel down.

“You coward. Kick the can down the road and hope you don’t have to deal with it.” Maddy yells.

“Madison. This is not the time or place…” the mayor says but he is cut off by Maddy.
“Bullshit. This is what town council meetings are for. To discuss and take on problems the town is facing. You are a coward.”

“I will not stand for this.” The mayor says.

“Yes. Yes you will. It’s your job. Being mayor isn’t just about the perks. It’s about doing what is often a thankless job.”

The crowd starts yelling at each other. I hop up on the large desk the council is sitting at and yell.
“Quiet.”

The town becomes a bit quieter.

“Good. Thank you.” I say before addressing the crowd. “You think my mom is cause for all this darkness? Think you don’t need her or me to protect you? Fine. Do it on your own. See how long that lasts.”

I say the last part while looking directly at Tiffany.

“You can’t be serious.” Maddy says to me.

“But I am. Like my mom. I don’t need your thanks but I also don’t want any disrespect or being stabbed in the back.”

“Fine. Wait until we get all this in social media and let the world know what’s going on here.” Tiffany says as she smirks.

“You will not. Anyone making posts about what goes on in our town will suffer significant jail time and fines. I’m officially ordering that not a single word get out about this. We will do nothing until we have some sort of vote.” The mayor says as he brings down his gavel again.

“Now who’s the fascist?” Tiffany screams.

“Bout time you got some balls.” Maddy yells.

The mayor glares at Maddy as he gets up and walks out of the room.

I look at Tiffany.
“Good luck.”

I walk out followed by everyone.

“Are you serious?” Maddy asks me.

“Sure. You heard them. Why stick my neck out while they start up witch trials?”

“Lot of them seemed cool with werewolf experiments. So my desire to help isn’t exactly high right now.” Holden says.

“This is madness. We can’t just not protect our city.” Maddy counters.

“I’m with Holden. What my mom has done is the big u spoken secret in this town. Since things have been safe for awhile. Everyone has forgotten and the ungratefulness has started. I’m not putting up with it.” I say.

“Think about this, Betty.” Maddy implores.

“I have. Here, take Jolene home. I want to walk around for a bit.” I say as I toss the keys to Maddy.

“Where are you going?” Asks Aurora.

“To clear my head.” I say as I start walking. 

I walk off and go through the farmers market. For whatever reason I go to the garrison. Since it’s night I,e it should be empty. I go inside and head directly to the office. I sit down and start opening desk drawers. I open the bottom one and find some journals. I close the drawer in anger. I open the other bottom drawer on the other side and say.
“Found it.”

I pull out the bottle of whiskey and open it. Then I take a big swig. I throw a leg on the desk and take another drink. As I sit there, Micah flies in and lands.
“Excuse me. Saw someone come in and thought it was your mom.”

“Nope. Just the dollar store version.”

“Something wrong?”

I sigh as I lean back.
“Yeah…I don’t  know. It seems like right when everything is ok and under control. Something comes at me sideways and fucks everything up.”

“What happened?” 

I become a bit animated.
“It’s like…fuck, man. Mom leaves and everyone forgets what she has done.”

“What do you mean? How so?”

“The town just had a bullshit council meeting. They want the world to know what goes on here. Hell, they want the military to come.”

“During peace time? What for?” Micah asks.

“To fight the darkness. For the illusion of safety I guess. If people would just be patient. Mom will be back soon. There just needs to be a bit of faith.”

Micah hikes a leg and sits on the desk.
“Seems they don’t respect you as the right person to fill in for your mom.”

I take another drink.
“Yeah. That’s about the long and short of it.”

Micah gives me a warm smile.
“The time will come when you can demonstrate that you are just as competent as your mom.”

I take another drink.
“That’s the thing. I’m not sure I am.”

“It is fascinating the differences between you and your mother.”

“What? She’s not a failure and I might be?” I ask.

Micah scoffs.
“Self doubt. Your mom has very little. At times you seemed crippled by it.”

I take a drink.
“I don’t know how she did it. I’m bigger, stronger and faster than her but she is the one that makes it look easy. I feel like on a good day, I’m barely up to the task.”

“Your mother had it far from easy. She struggled greatly at times. I’ve seen it firsthand.”

As I hold the bottle. I rest my head on it.
“You saw here. What was she like when the shit went down?”

Micah looks in the distance. Like he is lost in memory.
“Tenacious, she refuses to quit. No matter how bad the odds are.”

“I crumble. All I e done up until this point is fake it. Act like I got some sort of authority from my mom. I’m like…a castle built on sand.”

Micah puts a hand on mine.
“Leadership is a challenge. You are smart and capable. Most importantly you have a hood heart. The key in being a good leader is to let your heart guide your mind.”

I put a hand in Micah’s.
“That means a lot coming from you. As a leader, you’re not so bad yourself.”

Micah chuckles as I get up and hug the gargoyle.
“Thanks.”

The gargoyle wraps his arms around me.
“It is no burden. My heart and ears are always open to you.”

I sniff as I try and hold back the tears.
“That means more to me than I can say. I should go. I’m sure you have more important things to do.”

“Unless you’re good. There’s nothing important at hand.”

“I’m ok. So attend to your duties.”

Micah gives me a squeeze and leaves. I’m feeling restless so I go outside. I walk around and end up standing in front of an old spray paint mural of mom and Lily. I have my whiskey still so I take another drink.
“Sup, mom.” I say.

I stand there and look at the mural.

“Public intoxication, huh?” 

I turn and see Chief Bannon walking towards me.

“I’m not intoxicated yet and soon I’ll be back in private.” I respond.

Chief Bannon stands next to me and lols at the mural.
“I’ll just ignore the borderline underage drinking.”

“It’s close but I’m good.”

“I suppose you’re right. Hell of a woman your mom.”

“Someone called her tenacious.”

Chief Bannon snorts.
“That’s a polite way of saying it. Other ways of saying it are bitch, stubborn, pig headed and pain in the ass.”

“I can’t disagree.”

“Still. At the end of the day. There’s no one I rather have by my side when the shit goes down.”

“I know you two aren’t exactly best friends but she always spoke highly of you.”

“I think highly of her. I’m glad she protects this town.”

Chief Bannon starts to walk away but stops and turns around.
“You tell her I said anything nice about her. I will shoot you in the ass.”
Then he walks away.

I look back at the mural. The thing that is coming into focus for me. Is that my mom is far more complex than I thought.",2,1731081115.0,MythosIndustries,0,1.0,False

During my visit at Pao Cafe, I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and a garlic butter chicken banh mi. I specifically asked the staff at the counter to confirm that my order did not contain pork, and I was assured that it did not.

Upon receiving my order, I once again confirmed with the waiter that the dish served was indeed the garlic butter chicken banh mi, and he reassured me that it was. However, halfway through my meal, I discovered that the banh mi contained ground pork in addition to shredded chicken.

This incident is deeply troubling, especially as I was wearing a hijab, clearly indicating my Muslim faith. Despite my explicit inquiries and the visible signs of my religious identity, I was served pork. This oversight is not only offensive but also a serious breach of trust.

1gmlldy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1gmlldy/i_was_catfished/,I was catfished ,"Few years back I had been having a decent back and forth with a guy. I'd been playing the long game with. He was cute af, seemed remarkably stable (I was 22 at the time, his profile said 24) for a guy on grindr and had all the right things going on. About a month into conversation we finally decided to meet up. We organised to meet at a cafe and have coffee.

To say I was keen to meet this guy was an understatement, I’d developed a crush on him and spent far too long on making myself look good. Date time rolled around and I showed up at the cafe a little early to scope the situation out etc. I got a message from him shortly after saying he was having car trouble and asked if I minded coming to his so we didn't have to bail on the date. I (rather stupidly) didn't see the issue here and went off to his place, it was only a few blocks over.

I got there, knocked on the door and was greeted by a guy in his early 50s.

""hey.... is C (him) here?"" I asked assuming this must be the guy's father.

""you're looking at him. Hello J (me), it's nice to meet you in person finally"" he said with what looked like a slight smirk

My world spun. A guy old enough to be my father had catfished me? He had spent a MONTH creating a young persona to... I didn't even know... lure me into meeting him? What the fuck was going on?!

He invited me in and I just stood there, gobsmacked. Then I heard a voice from inside the house call out

""C, is that J at the door?""

Another guy in his 50s appeared at the door and looked me in the eye and then looked me up and down. He made some kind of comment about me looking better in the flesh and encouraged me inside. I’m still stunned, practically open mouth shock at whatever the hell is going on and am now trying to plan my getaway in my head. I decided to just excuse myself back to my car politely.

They tried to insist I come in and we could get to know one another and I kinda blew up. I remember calling them “creepy fucks” and that they “epitomised all the dark shit people thought about gay men” and then I just ran back to my car and drove off. Didn’t even look back.

My entire drive home I was shaking, To this day, I still don’t understand what the fuck they thought was going to happen after I showed up, but I’ll never understand how anyone could see this kinda thing as acceptable in the slightest.",6,1731080889.0,lgbt,2,1.0,False

Before that, I was working in bars, restaurants, coffee shops, trying to get by through scrounging together a living. I never considered going to college to be a viable option until one day I just got sick of being so purposeless and poor working in a cycle of dead end jobs, so I enrolled in my community college to get a science degree.

Fast forward four years and I’m finished with my bachelor’s degree and already have a job making $100k+ a year. I have a really nice apartment, a new car, and a healthy savings account. I have health insurance and stock options. I wake up every morning feeling less stressed and more at ease.

Of course some people have different dreams, but coming from someone who went from not having a degree and to having one, it feels like life with one is significantly easier than without.

1gmlk31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gmlk31/do_you_really_need_common_interests_to_make_a/,Do you really need common interests to make a marriage work?,"Co-worker recently lamented to me that he's been on a dozen coffee dates in the past month and either the woman's politics don't align with his (not even going to open that can of worms) or they have no common interests and so they never go on a second date.  He said he's basically over dating because the entire dating pool is lame.  I argued to him that you don't need common interests and he should focus on finding someone he really connects with.  He told me this was a stupid idea.

This prompted me to have a conversation with my wife where we talked about our common interests and realized that we seem to have none.  Like zippy.  We dated for a year, were engaged for about 4 mos and now have been married for all of about 6 weeks and we have no common interests beyond waking up and going to sleep with each other.  Given a day with nothing on the schedule, we're content to just sit around the house and enjoy each other's company.

We all are separated by bodies of flesh, blood, bone and all other vicera. We pretend we aren't. We stick to others and try to banish loneliness and even success to a degree. But in moments of quietness be it when alone murmuring to yourself of about today's happening or even in the middle of a busy crowd amidst the crowd's strange democratic shifts, one remembers himself alone. One cannot truly know the inner machinations of another how close they appear to be. I do not know what blue looks like through your eyes or the taste of coffee for you. We stick to things you know we stick to others, we stick to art, we stick to higher meaning but they all are lies. Lies meant to banish the feeling of loneliness. But all we have are lies. Lies are all we can conjure. Lies so real they replace reality. Maybe they are to us atleast. That's all it matters.

***Log. 4001.g***  
*It goes without saying I lost some physical drives, but it was worth it. I managed to perfectly restore memories from some of the AIs, but was unable to make an antidote for the virus. Me and the Programmer have been working on this non-stop, although I feel a bit bad for the lives we created.* 



It seemed like they had spent days inside that bunker. Misha had no strength on her legs, and it was Gayo who kneeled beside her and pulled her to his arms. That had been a horrible night, and it seemed nowhere close to an end. At least Misha hoped the Forest People would believe the Immortal was responsible for all that.

— Guys… — Séra spoke, as she helped a confused Ganen stand up. — I think we should look for a way out. 

— Yes. — Misha cleaned her face. — You’re right, we need to leave, and we need to do it now. — She sniffed and got up with her brother. — The Immortal came in somehow, and got stuck in that room. Maybe we can go out the same way.

— The only problem is getting into that bloody room. — Resha replied.

“I’ll try the hatch”, Gayo signalled. He climbed the stairs with a lump in his throat, it had to be open, but he couldn’t be sure. The Immortal had closed it with its mind or something, and now it was dead. Maybe they were stuck in there forever.

When he reached the hatch and failed to open it, he was sure his theory was true. They were stuck. He went down with a sad, angry face; he didn’t have to say a word for all the others to know their situation.

— Okay, then. — Misha was still shaking, but she was the matriarch and had to do something. — We *must* find a way out. 

“I’ll try the bloody room.” Gayo signalled. “Resha, wanna join me? Not that I’m afraid of blood or anything, just…”

— Yeah, I’ll go with you. We can see if the hole leads anywhere.

— Right. Then me and the girls will look for a way out from here. — Misha looked at Ganen and Séra, who agreed, then she held her brother’s shoulders, and gave him a tight hug. — Be careful.

Gayo nodded, and the group started looking around as the place was being half-lit by their lanterns. Ganen pointed at the wall of rations, she wanted to check those out, the Farmers couldn't possibly eat all that alone, and Misha said they could keep as much as they wanted. There was the question if any of that was still edible, after all no one knew how long those had been in there for.

Misha followed them to the wall, and Séra saw a broken door a little to the left; she asked Ganen to check the food and Misha to look for bags or boxes, anything they could carry the food in, while she looked beyond the door. 

Once her light lit the room, Séra’s eyes widened: there were two skeletons inside human-like mechanical things. Anxious, she stayed as still as possible, waiting for a response from the machines. After a few anxious seconds of nothingness, she took a deep breath and walked in.

Será poked one of the machines with her foot, ready to run away and shut the door. The metallic parts didn't move, and the woman was able to breathe again. Then she changed her focus to the *human* skeleton. The ribs were broken, the pieces rested inside what was left of the ribcage.

She crouched and moved it around; the metal parts were somehow screwed into the bones, and the only thing she could imagine was how much that would hurt. The other skeleton was in a similar condition, and upon closer inspection, there were tiny punctures on its surface. She wondered if that was the work of the Immortal, ages ago.

Their bony hands were grabbing long metal tubes, with something like a switch near their fingers, and small metal cases on the floor. She cleaned the dust off of one, and took it to Ganen, who was opening one of the food bricks.

— Whatcha think it is? — Séra asked.

—Uhm… since you found near some tubes, maybe they were projectiles? Like, with needles on the top and humans blew the tubes, like a blowpipe? But, I mean, it's kinda heavy. — She started to mumble about weird ideas people from her study group were used to having. — Maybe humans from the past had a larger lung capacity?

— What? — Séra didn't follow. The explosion might have made her confused. Maybe both of them.

— Oh, nothing really, just theories to distract me. I just don’t want to think about… you know.

— That sounds like a good idea. Maybe I should try to get some theories myself. — Séra smiled as Ganen returned the small case. 

On the other side, Gayo and Resha were covering their mouths and noses to get inside the room the Immortal once was. It stank of blood and rotting meat, and it was worse than before. 

Resha flashed their lantern over the hole where the machine had been stuck, and it didn’t look very safe. They also couldn’t see the end of it, and no one could tell if the tunnel was still open on the surface. Gayo poked them, and signalled “I’ll get down there, walk a bit, see what I can find. I’m smaller than you so…” 

Resha nodded, and offered him the lantern; the light was hurting their eyes anyway, so it was a relief. They told him not to go too far and come back soon, to which he agreed; there was no need to lose anyone else.

The hole turned itself into a long dark tunnel, with no other corridors or openings in different directions. The Immortal had come in an almost straight line. Gayo walked slowly, he had to be careful so that the earth wouldn’t swallow him whole; he didn’t want his sister to lose anyone else. Besides, he was still a bit confused from the explosion.

However, after he walked for a while, he hit a wall. That part of the tunnel had collapsed who knew how long ago, and unless they knew in which direction to dig, they would all die in there. “At least we would be already buried”, he thought. There was a terrible joke.

He turned around and started walking back, at least the Immortal was large, so Gayo didn’t have to crawl on the ground. His witty mood, though, vanished once he saw Resha’s face. There was so much hope in their eyes, and he was about to snuff it.

He shook his head as he climbed out, and Resha sighed; at least they wouldn’t have to waste any other second in that place. Both left and decided to explore more. They saw the girls with two bags of rations each, and offered to help.

— Actually, I think it’s easier if we leave them somewhere while we look for a way out. — Ganen proposed. — They’re quite heavy. 

— Fair enough. — Misha agreed, as she let her bags fall to the floor. — When we got in, the Forest People were over there, maybe there’s a way out or buttons to open the hatch, I don’t know.

— Let’s check it. — Resha said, and started walking. Anywhere was better then so close to the bodies.

It was good to keep their minds busy, at least they could deal with one problem at a time. The group followed Resha with their lanterns and started looking for anything that could be a door. There were some closets and tiny storage rooms, with a lot of strange things.

More of those long metal tubes and cases, black boxes in weird shapes, and cables. There were so many cables, and Ganen opened a large smile. Perhaps there were some she could use to check those memory blocks they had found in the desert. She had been so worried about her own survival, she had almost forgotten about those.

Ganen started putting them in her pockets, along with anything that looked like the memory blocks she knew; she had no idea what information could be in those, but she wanted to know. Maybe there was a way to defeat the Immortals more easily, afterall, people always said the Machines allowed the Moon to swallow the Sun, so there *had* to be something in there.

Séra was more interested in the tools she found, some of them even looked new, and it was good to have spares. She wished there was some brake fluid as well, but she found nothing remotely similar to that. 

And it was Resha who found a weird panel full of switches and buttons. They brought the lantern closer and tried to read the words, but many were unknown — or incomplete. “Worst case scenario, we die, which is what will happen if we can’t find a way out”, they thought before pushing a switch. 

Nothing happened.

They pushed another, and all the lights were turned on.

Misha screamed, ready to grab her brother and hide, Séra pushed Ganen into the tiny room and was about to close the door, then Resha laughed.

— I found the lights.

— Resha?? Fuck you! You almost gave me a heart attack! — Misha punched their shoulder, and Resha smiled. 

— Maybe if I keep pushing these, one of them will open the door. I just have no idea what’s written.

— Can I check? — Ganen asked, relieved it was Resha. — Not that I understand any of it, but maybe I could help you make sense of the words.

— Be my guest. — The farmer stepped to the side.

Ganen, followed by Séra, looked at the panel confused, and it was the mechanic who recognised some of the codes: the vowels were missing, but if one had some idea of what the words were supposed to mean, it wasn’t that difficult to understand them. Koira had taught her many things from the past, and they didn’t feel as useless now.

— I think the ones on this block might open something. — She pointed to the ones in the lower right, and Resha started pushing them.

At first, nothing happened. Then, after a few seconds, a loud, heavy hiss froze their bodies. A deep *thud* echoed, and metal started sliding against metal. Resha and Séra traded a look, and the woman left to see what was happening. She was ready to scream, and Resha was ready to undo what she had done.

Séra flashed her light to the bunker, her eyes peeled, looking for any sign of movement. She couldn’t find anything different.

— Resha, do it again. — she asked.

She squinted her eyes, trying to focus better at the unknown. The hiss startled them again, but this time, Séra followed the sound. And she saw a small part of the wall sliding shut. 

— OH MY SUN! We found it!! Resha, ya found it! I think we found a way out! — Séra came running back, as excited as she could be. — Push it again, it opens a door!

— A door? — Misha asked. — I thought we had tried all of them.

— A *secret* door! Let’s check where it goes, than we come back and get the food.

They looked at one another; there was no other choice.



***Log. 3786.v.c***  
*It all took twenty-one days. Exactly two days after the last memory was deleted, the virus changed. It was as if it had mutated and become something new. It was from that point on the programmer said we shouldn’t consider the AI alive any more. And this happened again and again, with the AIs we created.*  
  


Qena finally called Koira over the comms. She asked if she could go to her house and talk, to which the older woman agreed; Koira had been meaning to talk to her as well, but the girl never answered.

She decided to make some coffee and try to tidy up her place; there were bits and pieces everywhere from her ideas, and since she was quite sure Tovu would accept the prosthetics, she wanted to improve the design.

After the talk with Luqa, Tovu asked to check the prosthetics again, and he even fit one on his left arm. Koira helped him attach it — it was a prototype, and it didn’t have the nerve endings — and move it, and he couldn’t even hide how good it felt. He rested both arms on his legs and whispered it was comforting.

He hadn’t given her a proper answer yet, but she was sure it would be a *yes*, and since he had sort of tested the arm, she wanted to make some adjustments. She had spent the last few days working on it, so her house was chaotic.

The water started boiling as she ran back to the kitchen to turn off the fire. She put the coffee powder into a press and slowly poured water over it. Koira pressed it more quickly than usual, so that she could have a chance to at least move all her mess to a corner, but Qena was faster. She had long legs.

Qena’s hair was a bright red fiery aura around her face. She was more beautiful than ever. Koira was baffled for a second, she blinked a few times before being able to speak.

— I’ve made some coffee. Come in. — She stepped to the side.

— That’s nice. 

Qena walked in followed by Koira, and noticed the house was the same as always. She had felt lost when she first started visiting the woman, but it never changed, so she got used to the coffee-perfumed mess. She sat on a chair in the kitchen and crossed her legs.

 — So… — Koira showed up with two hot cups. — How ya doin'? 

— Okay, I guess. — She shrugged.

— What do ya wanna talk about? — Maybe it was better if she started; it could give Koira some clues on how to say what *she* needed.

— About the other day… at the party. — She paused. — You left with Ana. 

— Yah, I was rather drunk. And I didn't want to spoil your party.

— *Our* party. — Qena was angry. — You and I did it together! It was supposed to be for *us*. But you spent all your time with her.

— We were talking about mechanics and something to mass produce the… 

— At the party, yes. But then you left together! And Masin said Ana didn’t sleep in her house. — Qena was hurt, she felt cheated on, left behind. Replaced. 

— She slept here, because I couldn't fit the key through the hole, and she didn't want me to sleep with the house open. — One thing was leading to another, and it made her certain she had kept that going on for too long.

— Did you sleep with Ana? — Qena was blunt.

— What?! No! She even slept on the sofa! — She was replied with silence, which seemed to last forever. — Qena, but what if I had? I mean, ya and I are just friends.

— Are we? *Just* friends, nothing else?

— Yah, I mean… as far as I know. — Koira felt like if she had to defend herself, even though she had done nothing wrong.

— I thought we were something more. You never stopped me, you blushed and I *see* how you look at me.

— I thought ya were joking at first. — Koira took a deep breath. — And when ya stopped hinting at it, and got more direct, I was… a bit confused about, uhm, how I felt.

— What about now? — There was a sudden bean of hope in her eyes.

— Now I think I understand better. Ya don't want someone to fool around with, right? Ya want a girlfriend.

— Well, that was a shameful read. — Qena mumbled; she had been denying that for a while, but it was impossible now. Apparently, *even Koira* could see it.

— The thing is… I love ya and all, you're my best friend. — Koira paused, she was afraid of being insensitive.

— There's a *but*.

— There is. I don't want a girlfriend. Or a boyfriend, for that matter. It's just… I prefer doing other things, I can focus better, and I think it would affect my job.

— Oh. — Qena looked at her own feet. She was so embarrassed. Of course Koira didn't want a *boyfriend*. At the same time, she felt diminished, less important than a job, put aside, a hobby for the “free time”. — Really? I guess I got it quite wrong, then.

— Look, I… uhm, a relationship is… pretty much like a friendship. With, how can I say it, some… benefits? And without changing your priorities, because you're just friends.

— Oh, so you're only interested in the sex, no responsibility. — Qena rolled her eyes, disappointed, angry.

— That's not what I said. And I might sound selfish, but I don't want to change my routine, my hobbies, the things I like, the things I hide… 

— And you think this will happen.

— I *know* it will. It's always like this. I heard so many stories over the years, I’ve never felt even curious about it. It sounds like too much work. — Koira wasn't looking at her. She couldn't. The woman was well aware she was hurting Qena.

— I see. — There was something on Koira's voice when her opinion was written in stone. Qena knew it quite well. She got up, and adjusted her dress. — I guess I'll go now. Thanks for the coffee. — She left the mug on the kitchen table, and started walking away.

— Qena, wait… — Koira got up, ready to follow her.

— Koira, don’t. I need to think. I'm not used to being in this position. I need some time, I hope you understand.

Koira opened her mouth, but no words came out. She watched Qena walk away, leave her house, and close the door. She wanted to run and hug her, apologise for hurting her so much, but her legs were too afraid to move. What if that made herself be misunderstood yet again? 

She fell on the chair, no idea of what to do, face hidden in her hands. 

— How could I have been so stupid?! — She scolded herself. 

***Log. 3786.v.b***  
*In about two days, the first one caught the virus, so I monitored them closely. First, the virus scanned and selected all the sad memories, then it erased them one by one. The most neutral disappeared not long after that, and finally the happy memories (which, by this point, were already rather incomplete). The memory loss is gradual, so it goes almost unnoticed, especially if one doesn’t have a person to ask them about the past, for example.* 



Séra waited in front of the secret door as Resha pushed the button again. The door cried, rust against rust, and soon it slid to the side. Uninviting darkness filled the crevice, and the woman swallowed hard. She needed courage to go in there.

Her light fought the old shadows for a moment, before they retreated, ready to engulf the corridor once again at the first opportunity. Séra called the others, she couldn’t muster the courage to go in alone, and relief filled her body as Ganen held her hand.

— I think some of us should go and check where it leads. — Misha said, as she looked into the darkness. — So that, if something happens, we won’t all die. Sorry if I’m being too blunt, but… 

— I understand. — Resha said, and the others nodded. — I can go, if someone tags along.

The other four exchanged a look, Misha was the matriarch, Ganen’s arm was hurt, Gayo was deaf, and Séra quickly understood she was the best option. It was dark, and communicating by signals would be complicated.

— Okay, let’s go. — Séra didn’t want to go.

— Wait, shouldn’t we get something to prevent you guys from getting lost? We don’t know if the corridor is straight up or if there are other paths and such. — Ganen was worried, she didn’t want to leave Séra alone, but she knew she would be a hindrance if they had to fight.

— Like? — Misha asked.

— A thread, for example. — She remembered a story from a long lost past, about a guy who used thread to avoid getting lost in a labyrinth. — How much cable is there in the explosives room? 

— That’s smart, Ganen. — Resha was surprised. — I’d never think about it. I generally just power through stuff! — They laughed a bit.

— I’ll go get the remaining cables, then we can sort it in a way to help us. — Séra felt calmer knowing Ganen wouldn’t let them get lost. All she wanted was to go back to the surface with her lover, both safe and sound.

There were metres and more metres of cable, and soon one end was tied to a heavy table by the door, and the other was in Resha’s hand. They asked if Séra was ready — she wasn’t, but agreed anyway — and both walked into the darkness.

A few metres in, their eyes started to get used to the anaemic light. The problem, though, was that light brought shadows along. Arms of darkness danced around them, threatening, terrorising. So when Séra felt Resha’s warm fingers touching hers in fear, she held them tight. It was easier that way. 

Séra looked back, even though she couldn’t see the entrance anymore. There had been a curve near the beginning, so they lost contact pretty fast. She tried not looking around much, if there were skeletons in the other rooms, she was certain there would be at least one in that corridor.

Resha seemed to share her opinion; they looked ahead and nowhere else. Both were walking slow enough to prevent most falls, and the floor wasn’t as irregular as they expected. The walls, however, didn’t take long to become as irregular as a cave.

— Did you see that? — Resha pressed her hand. — I’m sure that was *not* a shadow.

— It ain’t moving now that we stopped, eh? — It was hopeful thinking. 

They stared at the shadows for what seemed like hours, days. The people didn’t move, they barely breathed. The shadow stood, as still as the lantern on the floor. Both took such a long breath, Séra had to hold her knees for a moment.

— Holy shit, I wanna punch it. — She joked, and instantly regretted it. Her laugh soon turned into an embarrassed smile, but Resha didn’t notice.

— Right?! I so wanna punch it, that made so scared, fuck. 

Resha took the initiative — and the lantern — and walked to whatever had them shaking at their knees. Séra walked a bit behind them, her wrench in hands, ready for the unwanted worst. 

— It’s just a broken skeleton. — Resha was relieved. 

— Yah, but… what broke it?

— Let’s not think about it.

They pulled the cable a little more and kept moving; Séra, however, stayed there, looking at those empty eyes, that everlasting smile of death, and the ribs, each one of them broken, nothing but shards. She couldn’t help but think that was quite similar to the one she had found behind the ration wall.

She turned around and rushed to Resha’s side. They smiled and offered their hand again, which Séra didn’t hesitate to hold.

Ganen felt a tug on the cable, and helped it unfold itself. It was difficult even *trying* to keep calm with Misha by her side. The woman had put too much on her shoulders, and she also carried the guilt of all the blood on the floor. 

The researcher sighed; even her breath was shaking. Ganen kept looking at the knot on the leg of the table, from time to time she checked if it was still tight, or if there was enough cable. She thought of asking Misha if they should go find some more, just in case, but the woman wasn’t there. Neither was her brother.

Ganen started to look for her, her eyes darted in every direction, until she saw Gayo pointing his crossbow at something ahead. She froze as her heart started racing. If the Immortal was back, then they were all… Then Gayo lowered the crossbow, took a good look at it, and decided to set it on a table to adjust it. Ganen almost melted to the floor. Angry, she decided to check the knot once more; they’d scream if they needed her.

Ahead of Gayo, Misha was kneeling on the floor, looking for something from Finnian and Nika she could bring back to Soña. A ring, a handkerchief, anything to remember them by. Tears blurred her eyes, she had given up on hiding them.

Gayo offered help, his knees were about to follow hers when she stopped him, her hands expressing the pain in her heart: “I have to do this alone.”

When their parents died, she acted just the same. He tried to say she wasn’t responsible for any of it, but Misha wouldn’t look at him. Afraid of making it worse, he gave her some space. He remembered how one of the shots felt wrong during the fight, and decided there was no better time to fix it. 

He noticed Ganen staring, so he pointed at her, put his thumbs up, and shrugged his shoulders in a question. She nodded slowly, not sure if that was the correct answer, then pointed at him. Thumbs up again. If she wasn’t so nervous, if they weren’t locked, swallowed by the earth itself, if Séra wasn’t lost in the darkness, maybe *then* things would be okay.



***Log. 3786.v.a***  
*I must admit it was easier than I’d thought. My childhood friend, he’s an amazing programmer — better not save his name — and he helped me with my project. We created Artificial Intelligences, set up documents and personal info, put it all in the Cloud, made back-ups and supervised it non-stop.*



Koira was disappointed in herself. She knew she had to tell Qena, but the last thing she had ever wanted was hurting the girl. And once again Qena had vanished from her life for weeks. At night, she kept laying awake, waiting for someone to knock on her door and walk in exasperated, needing to talk about some crazy stuff. Koira missed that.

However... she didn't want the same thing as Qena. She felt selfish, asked herself how she could not settle for a relationship and call it even. And in the same tone, she would answer it wasn't worthwhile doing something half-assed. Although that didn't quiet her mind every time.

She thought of talking to Ana about it, but Koira didn't want to bother her with such things. The problem was, she had no one else to talk to about the situation. There was Tovu, but even the idea made her laugh; it sounded so ridiculous!

She was forced to stay quiet, arguing with herself over whether or not she had made the right decision. Until she couldn't handle it anymore.

So there she was, standing in front of Qena's door, hoping all the time they didn't talk had been enough for the woman to think. She took a deep breath, and her hand stopped a few centimetres from the door. She didn’t want to lose Qena, she was ready to fight for that friendship. So she knocked on the door.

A person who worked in the house, Thany, opened the door for Koira and was surprised to see her. “Normally it’s the other way around!” Thany laughed, as Koira walked in. She said Qena was in her room, and asked if the woman needed any help to get there — it was a big house.

Koira thanked Thany, and both walked there in silence. The inventor was nervous, she didn’t know what to say, she hadn’t rehearsed this time, and no words came to her mind. It was a situation she couldn’t fix by changing a piece or adjusting the pressure. 

— Qena? Are you awake? — Thany knocked the door.

— Yes, why? — Qena answered. She sounded quite bored.

— Koira is here to see you.

— I don’t want to see her.

Thany looked at Koira with a worried face; she didn’t like insisting.

— Oi, come on, let’s talk. — Koira got closer to the door and asked. — I don’t wanna lose ya.

There was a long silence before some noise pointed to Qena getting up and walking to the door. She wore no makeup, her hair was tied with a black head band, and her robe was almost falling from one of her shoulders. She was beautiful as always.

— Fine. — Then she turned to Thany: — Thank you for opening the door.

Thany waved her hand, it was but her job, and left them alone; whatever drama was about to happen, she didn’t want to be a part of it.

— So, what do you want? — Qena asked. She wasn’t in the mood to be polite. Not that she was angry with Koira, she was simply… sad. 

— I wanted to talk. I still want to be friends with ya, I wanna have ya in my life. It’s sorta boring without ya. — Koira waited for a answer, but she got none. — Well, I also don’t wanna hurt ya any more, so if ya don’t want me in your life, I won’t bother ya again.

— Come in. — Qena said, after a long sigh. She gave Koira space to walk into her room, closed the door, and sat on the bed. — So?

— Ah, well, I don’t know. — Koira looked around and sat at the desk. — Something I said bothered ya more than the rest. What was it?

— You said you didn’t want a *boyfriend*.

—Nor a girlfriend. — Koira was still confused. — Is that what bothered ya? 

— Yeah. I mean, I didn’t know you knew. Not that I hide it or anything, but… 

— I have no idea what you’re talking about. — And Qena noticed her confusion was genuine. 

— Oh. Hang on. — Qena opened her closet and got a thick book from it. She put it on the desk and opened it. There was a picture of her family, her mother and father, and what looked like a little boy. She pointed at the child: — This is me.

— I had no idea! I… When I said I didn’t want a boyfriend, or girlfriend, I meant I didn’t want *any* of them, not that I didn’t want ya because ya were a boy. I mean, *ya ain’t* a boy! Gosh, I’m making things even worse, ain’t I?

— A bit. — Qena chuckled. — But I forgive your ignorance this time. My parents noticed I liked “girl stuff” more, and we had a talk, then I started the mods when I got a bit older. — She flipped some of the pages and showed herself as a teen; she had a round, chubby face, and a large smile. — So… it’s not like you don’t like me because of the body modifications, but…?

— Yah, I couldn’t care less about those, I just don’t want a serious lovey-dovey emotional thing, but I would love to keep being friends with ya. And, I mean, if ya want, I suppose we could try something, but I don’t wanna be, how can I say this… 

— Responsible for me?

— Something like this. — Koira was still looking at the pictures. It was crazy how someone could have so many photos when she was almost killed because of one. — I wish I had pictures of me and Séra as children. She was a cute kid too, just like ya.

— Don’t change the subject. — Qena complained, though she was a bit happy with Koira’s compliment. — What do you mean by “try something”?

— Ah, well, I mean… — Koira’s face got red. — Ya know, ya kept teasing me so for long. I must admit I got curious ‘bout what it feels like.

— Oh gosh! — Qena couldn’t help but laugh. She was glad it had been a misunderstanding. — I suppose once I’m feeling better, if we’re still up for it! I mean, my body may be a bit different from what you expect.

— I don’t mind. — Koira shrugged, still embarrassed. — I mean, I never did anything with anyone, so I don’t really expect nothing. 

— So, you *don’t* mind I’m different?

— Not at all, why would I? If I did, I think I’d be the wrong one. — Koira looked at Qena for a brief moment, then looked back at the pictures. — Everybody changes as they grow. All ya did was add some features that didn’t come with the original piece, which is what I do all the time. Why would it be wrong? I think it’s cool. 

— That’s a cool way of seeing it. — Qena smiled; it was like a weight lifted from her shoulders. — Wanna see the rest of the photos?

— Yah, tell me your stories, and maybe I can learn how to draw and tell ya all of mine. — Koira was so relieved, she had her friend again and maybe things would go back to normal soon.

— I suppose I can imagine the pictures, if you described them well enough.

They spent the afternoon going through Qena’s photographs, and it was such a nice time. Koira was happy they managed to repair their relationship, which gave her hope they could fix any future bumps on the road.

I’m writing for advice as I am at my wits end at this point. 

My 16 month old ragdoll boy Freddie is a menace. Unless he is actively entertained he becomes very destructive to our home. Starts scratching on furniture despite having 3-4 scratching stations available that he does use- but still goes for our couch. 


If not the couch then cables. He will go behind our tv unit where we cannot reach him and starts chewing on the cables while staring us dead in the eye. It’s not possible to block the unit off due to its design. 


I have tried independent play toys but he is not interested. The only time he does not do this is when we are actively playing with him and it’s starting to get to a point where I don’t even want to spend time in my living room as he will immediately make a beeline for the cables or the couch. I can’t just sit and eat a meal, or drink a coffee as I’ll have to get up at least 10 times to stop him and entertain him. 


please help because I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore ",6,1731080607.0,ragdolls,2,1.0,False

I have already plugged a Dummy MiniDP Plug into the `Nividia T1000`, but the card is still not recognized. No matter what combination of `Select Active Video = Auto/IGD/PEG` I set, either the `Nvidia T1000` is no longer activated or the `Intel UHD 630`.

For clarification: I want to use the IGD as a way to get tty access to the host.

If I enable `Devices -> Video Setup -> Select Active Video = PEG` and plug a dummy DisplayPort plug in to the onboard DisplayPort I can get the system to recognize the `Intel UHD Graphics 630` but just not as a `vga`.

I recently got a Kingrinder K6 and a Timemore Fish kettle, as an upgrade to my Timemore C3 and Hario Air Pouring jug (filled from just a regular kettle), and I am really struggling to dial in a coffee. It's an anaerobic natural colombian coffee and I have tried a few different grind sizes, between 55-85 clicks on the K6. Weirdly, I am finding practically no difference in brew time between 55-85 clicks, it pretty much always finishes drawdown at 2m30s +/- 5s.

What has been troubling me most is the bloom. No matter if it's at 55 or 85 clicks or any inbetween, the bloom has pretty much finished draining though by like 20s so I have no chance to swirl etc. I do pour in outwards in concentric circles, and will pour the bloom at 5g/s.

Recipe is as follows:

Cafec Abaca filters, 15g coffee to 255ml water (1:17). Using Tesco Ashbeck water, brewing at 94^(o)C

* Pour 1 - 50g water at 5g/s
* Pour 2 @ 45s - 105g at 3-5g/s (have tried a gentle swirl after this pour, adds 5-10s to total drawdown)
* Pour 3 @ 1:15 - 100g at 3-5g/s
* Finished drawdown by 2m30s +/- 5s

I do think it tastes slightly nicer at \~60 clicks than 80, but honestly both are a pretty lackluster in terms of taste and I am guessing my fast bloom drawdown could be to blame.  I know I could just try going even finer but much finer and I'm supposedly in espresso grind territory for the K6, and I've already not seen any drawdown speed difference going from 85 to 55 clicks which I don't really understand.

I'm still pretty new to this so any suggestions are appreciated - I just want to brew some tasty coffee!",1,1731080441.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Everything started great, cute lunch dates and all that. Went out maybe 5 times between, lunches, dinner and drinks. She would come down to my office and have coffee with me on a daily basis. This went on for 4 weeks in total. 

Our last date I thought went really well, we had plans made for the future. She wanted me to go to her best friend’s baby shower and meet her friends. We even talked about training and getting a hotel together for an upcoming marathon. 

All the sudden the day after our last date, I got a paragraph text saying she wishes the chemistry was better and that we’d be better off as friends. The only explanation I got was when I called her and she said she didn’t like a joke I made about the waiter taking long. I’m sure she isn’t sharing the whole truth. It hurt a lot because everything seemed good and on the right path for a long term relationship (both of our intentions).

It’s been a week of no contact and I’m trying to hold off and see if she’ll reach out. Do you have any advice on what I should do and things to help keep my mind on the positive moving forward. If she does reach out, how should I approach (obviously cautiously) right?

I don’t know how to get out of this “slump”

I guess to be more accurate, I’ve for the most part always felt like or been in a slump. Maybe my expectations aren’t good or maybe I refer to any level of steady state a slump. 

I have adhd and depression/anxiety that is medicated. In therapy. 

I wake up, with coffee to look forward to. Feed the pets. Dread having to spend 8 hours in front of my computer wondering how to fill the time. End up at Reddit or phone games. 
Eat random stuff for lunch (this week has been cottage cheese and rice cakes) then go back to more of the same. 
When I don’t feel physically/mentally weighed down, I can gather myself to go on a walk or bike ride. Otherwise I’m couch or desk bound. 
I throw in some reading and or tv watching, more phone games and reddit before going to bed early because I have nothing else to do. 
Married. Have a house. Everything is pretty steady state but I feel dread every morning and purposeless. I know this is privileged to be complaining about this but I feel like I’ve grown up always working hard or toward the things I thought would make me feel better- the things I was supposed to do and I did them but I still feel stupid, and lonely, and I don’t know how to begin to get out of this slump. Ready to have kids but I don’t want to think having kids will magically fix everything when more often than not, it’ll do the opposite.

Then a year later i had another abalation and that helped and i went to like 20 PVC’s a day witch i dont feel and it’s nothing. I am 21 now and been staying off nicotine and alcohol for 3 years now and i am going out with friends to play pool and was thinking mby I could have a beer or rum or something not like to get drunk but to have one or two beers and just chill. I had beer and even got drunk one or two times after I quit and was on medication and it didn’t seem to have any impact. Now i am just thinking will having a drink could start up issues again. 
PS. I never really understood my triggers for pvcs I taught mby coffee but i have had coffee even yesterday and i am fine. Lack of sleep could have been one but then again i work a job for a year now where i sleep only 4 h a night like 3 times a week and nothing. Another I taught could have been a lot of stress and anxiety because i was in a very crazy state in life and now i am good mentally. Or it could have been the alcohol so I rly dont know.

I’ve started hanging out with his friends over the past few months, and one of his good friends started showing interest in me. It started with flirty conversation at a party, and we slowly started talking a bit over instagram. This past weekend we went to a few Halloween parties as a group but she stayed with me the whole time, after the fort party my other friend and I went back to her apartment w one of her other friends to hangout for awhile. The next night we went to another party and as I was dropping her off at her place she asked me to stay over. We got coffee the next morning and the vibe was honestly really good. She was giving me genuine compliments and we were having great conversation. My uncertainty comes from how things have been outside of these situations. The night after I stayed over a few of us went back to her apartment the next day, she was still nice like she always is but she was treating it like we didn’t just spend a night together and go on that date. I understand that since we’re in the same friend group it could be a little weird and she might not wanna make it obvious that we’ve been hanging out the way that we have. So I talked to another good friend who’s close to us who then told me that she is into and it’s a good idea for me to pursue. She agreed to another date in a few days, but since we finished planning the date I’ve gotten no word from her. I honestly have no reason to believe that she’s not actually into me but the whole no texting thing just brings a bit of uncertainty. So i feel like I should talk to her ab if she wants to continue seeing eachother in this context, but i don’t want to come off as too forward since it’s really only been 2 or 3 weeks since any type of flirting started.

As the year winds down, it feels right to find someone who brings a bit of magic to the ordinary days, someone I’d genuinely want to call “mine.” We still have a month left, so maybe it’s time to meet someone special and make those days count. 

I know a dating app isn’t exactly Cupid’s ideal setup, but hey, I’m open to taking the chance! Who knows, maybe it’ll lead me to you, the “favorite person” who’ll add that extra sparkle to my days. If it’s you, I’ll happily make you the reason behind my smiles, the name on my notifications that makes me look twice, and the thought that sneaks into my daydreams.

I’m not looking for a fairy tale, just someone who’ll be the sunshine in my life—someone to share laughter, silence, small talks, and deep talks. Someone who’ll make even the most ordinary days feel like they mean something. Let’s be each other’s “everyday” from simple study dates  to late-night movies, and quiet moments we’ll remember just because we’re together.

A little about me:
- 5’0 college student who juggles books, chemicals, and a whole lot of caffeine (and somehow still finds time to date)
- I can be your partner in crime, your personal cheerleader, and the one to listen when life feels heavy
- Also, I have a sport, so introduce me to something you’re interested in too—let’s make it a way of sharing our little worlds with each other.

Dreaming of someone who:
- Doesn’t just say “hi” but knows how to keep a conversation going and has a curious mind (bonus points if you’re as random as I am!)
- Bonus if you’re from the yellow school (matic paskuhan date chz)
- Ideally from NCR so we can meet for coffee and long walks; in short, I’m not down for LDRs
- Has a warm heart, patient, and accepting of my quirks, late-night study sessions, and school stress
- I’d prefer someone taller, but honestly, the vibe matters.

If you’re someone who’s looking to build something real, someone who’s up for the small moments and big dreams, let’s make this connection one that we both look forward to every day.

1gmkzlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1gmkzlm/update_2_years_post_breakup/,Update: 2 Years post breakup ,"In so many ways I’m healthier. In my boundaries, how I’m unfazed by much, and my dedication to eating healthy/exercise. I don’t let other peoples feelings influence me as much. 

I’ve been able to use my stronger boundaries in all aspects of my life. Family, friends, and dating. I’ve very proud of myself for this. It feels like quite a bit of personal development. I love myself more and feel more confident. 

I’m still struggling from the past. The trauma bond is strong. I remember the good times which were the best times of my life. My life was very hard so the good times with him were literally the absolute best times of my life. Even the quiet times were beautiful, such as the morning cup of coffee we’d drink. Whenever I’m struggling and feel lonely I can’t help but transport myself back to the moments we had a home together and he’d be building something and I’d be gardening. I’d make lunch with food I’d pick from my garden and we’d be at peace. It was my first real home. 

It’s easier to remember the peace now compared to when it first all happened but I still remember his chaos, lies, deceit. How my heart was broken so forcefully. How I’ll never be that girl again that looked at love as magic. 

My health hasn’t fully recovered. When it all happened I was destroyed, I had 2 suicide attempts, I couldn’t eat for months and 40lbs fell off of me. When I was at my weakest and just skin and bones I contracted a bacterial infection from bad water (visiting family in developing country) and nearly died. Within hours my body was shaking and going into shock. Any longer I’d have gone into organ failure. I’m still not the same and I’ve been hospitalized a few times after this. I get shooting pains through my chest, I get extremely dizzy, faint, and basically have to live like a grandma being super careful constantly. 

I’m in once sense healthier though, I have more muscle than before and I eat very healthy. But something is still wrong because if of the hospitalizations. I went from running in the gym to the hospital the next day. 


When people say “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” I disagree and hate that saying. Maybe it’s the case if you’ve never experienced much pain. I’m at the end of my limit. This might have been the last pain I can accept. I often feel like a ghost floating above others. I am always looking to return back to myself, to see the colors of life again, and to live once again having a cup of coffee. 

Sometimes I am angry at him. My friend sends me a photo of him and he seems so happy. He doesn’t understand the trauma I’ve endured because of him. To him it’s a normal breakup and he went through therapy and overcome his breakup. For me it’s lifelong trauma and physical problems. 

In some ways I’m better and others I’m worse. 

I wish I had never had this experience in my life. I could have done without it just fine. It wasn’t necessary. What I gained doesn’t out weigh what I lost. 

If you’re still in this situation, I’m so sorry. 
The only thing I’m happy about is how quickly I left. I’m certain I’d be dead if I had tried to continue with him. 

One positive: I broke up at 29 and was turning 30 so I was worried about that. However, I’m now dating a guy who wants to marry me. He’s much more handsome, taller, athletic, more emotionally mature, extremely intelligent, has a good career and extremely high earning potential also amazing family. He’s religious and not a porn addict/user. A literal upgrade in every way like God packaged him for me. 

Unfortunately my heart is so damaged I feel I can only use half my heart for him now. It’s something I’m working on. ",13,1731079306.0,loveafterporn,6,0.93,False

Can anyone recommend what is better? Is the Go Plus a good compromise for travel?
Or should I get a Clear and find some suitable travel case + a decent little mug? Any recommendations on those? 

And maybe what grinder would be suitable to remain compact?

A small, quiet town with a population of exactly 5,147, or at least that’s what the road sign used to say. Now, it’s a ghost town—every last soul gone without a trace, as if they’d vanished into thin air. The police department was at a loss, and state authorities were scratching their heads. So they brought us in, hoping a few fresh eyes might uncover what they’d missed.
At first, I’d convinced myself this would be another dead-end case, something that would baffle us for a while, and then we’d all be called away to more “pressing” matters. But that was before I found the journal.
It was stashed under the floorboards of the Twist family’s farmhouse, concealed like a hidden treasure. I remember dusting off the cover, noting the rough, calloused handwriting etched deeply into the paper. A journal kept by Jack Twist, the local farmer, his wife Maria, and their children, Ethan and Jessica. Reading it felt strange, invasive even, like I was peeking into his life through a veil that was too thin. But I had to know. I had to understand what happened here, no matter how strange or impossible the story might seem.
“Go ahead, tell me why everyone vanished,” I whispered to the empty farmhouse as I opened the journal, flipping to the first date that caught my eye. The words seemed innocent enough, the daily thoughts of a farmer who’d lived the same routine for decades. But there was a subtle tension—an unease threading through his words, hidden in the margins.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 21
I woke up at six a.m., just like every other day. Had flapjacks for breakfast, coffee on the side. Syrup was thick and sweet, just how I like it. Got me thinking it’d be even better with chocolate chips, though. Maybe I’ll surprise the kids with some tomorrow. That thought was enough to get my mouth watering.
I can picture him—Jack, a man who worked with his hands, his life defined by the rhythm of planting and harvesting, season after season. I imagine him at the breakfast table, savoring a simple pleasure, his mind half on his family, half on the long day ahead.
By six-thirty, I was out in the fields, preparing the soil. Spread some fertilizer and mixed in the compost. Maria joined me after she got the kids off to school. She’s got a good hand for this work, that woman. Always knows just how much to give to the earth to make it yield what we need.
In his words, I could hear his admiration for Maria. Not the sentimental kind, but the practical, respectful admiration of a man who knew his wife’s worth in a quiet, unspoken way. A family bound not just by love, but by work, by shared purpose.
By seven, the kids were off, and Maria was at my side in the field. We finished prepping the soil by seven forty-five and took a well-deserved break, sipping water and looking over our work. There’s something comforting in the pattern of the rows, each line straight and true.
I paused, picturing the neat rows stretching out across the farmland. There was a rhythm to his life, a sense of order. But life in a place like Ashmont was often quiet and simple, right until it wasn’t.
Around nine, we started planting—corn, soybeans, a few other vegetables. Just enough to keep us through the season and maybe sell a bit extra at the market come harvest. By noon, we stopped for lunch. I had a salad, though I’ll be honest, it wasn’t as good as Maria’s cooking. But work doesn’t wait, and soon we were back to it.
He wrote with a blunt simplicity, a straightforwardness that felt like him. No pretension, no drama—just a farmer doing his job. I admired the way he took pride in his work, though he didn’t exactly say so.
We fed the animals after lunch, kept an eye out for any pests and weeds that might creep in. Spent the rest of the afternoon moving from one chore to the next, checking on each crop, every animal, till it was eight in the evening.
Then came the first sign of something out of place. My eyes widened as I read his next words.
When I went outside after dinner, I saw something strange. Lights in the sky. Bright, almost too bright, moving fast—faster than anything I’ve ever seen. Too close to be a shooting star. At first, I thought maybe it was some military aircraft, though I’ve never seen one come this close to the fields.
I could picture him, standing in the cool night air, the warm glow of the farmhouse behind him, staring up into the darkening sky as those strange lights passed overhead. It must have felt like an omen, a signal that something was coming, though he couldn’t know what.
After that, I didn’t think too much about it. Just went to bed like always.
I closed the journal, leaning back in my chair. It was just an ordinary day on the surface, but beneath the routine, there was a tension building—a feeling that things were about to go very wrong. Jack’s words were plain, unembellished, but they carried weight, a creeping unease that was beginning to settle over me.
Back in the farmhouse, I took a deep breath, glancing around the empty rooms. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It was silly, of course, but the sense of abandonment here was overpowering. This had been a family’s home, filled with life, warmth, laughter. Now it was nothing but hollow silence.
“What did you see, Jack?” I murmured, running my hand over the rough wood of the table, imagining Jack and Maria sitting here with their children, talking over breakfast, planning their day.

Currently in the process of being diagnosed but doctor already told me it’s 99% gastritis. Endo in 5 weeks.

I’ve had reflux on and off for the last 9 years but was always able to manage with diet unless I drank alcohol or to much coffee and I would have to use a gaviscon. 

Since 6 months I have pain in my stomach, on and off nausea (luckily that has already been gone since 4 months) increased reflux, lpr and feeling gassy and bloated (burping a lot) which all get worse if I have a trigger food.

The last week had been bad with reflux and lpr after I had a couple of glasses of wine after a funeral. I’ve stopped drinking in the last couple of months but felt like shit after the funeral and needed a drink (I know, dumb).

PPI’s make me feel like shit so I thought let’s try betaine hcl even after reading that it’s not a great idea with gastritis. Took a pill during dinner and there was slight burning but I continued eating. The burning went away and I feel absolutely amazing now. There is zero reflux and only very very little burning. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Can betaine hcl actually help with gastritis? I will discuss this with my doctor as well but was just curious if anyone else had experienced this.

Thanks!

I was recently in a depressive episode which effected negativity my relationship with my family, friends, and job. 
Today after 20 days of sticking to my room, i went out. It was nice, i enjoyed a little walk and grabbed a coffee on my way home.

I ruined my relationships just because i was being dramatic. 
My guilt is making me want to not get better, for the sake of the people around me who will think i was faking it and hurt them in the process.

Maybe my expectations aren’t good or maybe I refer to any level of steady state a slump. 

I have adhd and depression/anxiety that is medicated. In therapy. 

I wake up, with coffee to look forward to. Feed the pets. Dread having to spend 8 hours in front of my computer wondering how to fill the time. End up at Reddit or phone games. 
Eat random stuff for lunch (this week has been cottage cheese and rice cakes) then go back to more of the same. 
When I don’t feel physically/mentally weighed down, I can gather myself to go on a walk or bike ride. Otherwise I’m couch or desk bound. 
I throw in some reading and or tv watching, more phone games and reddit before going to bed early because I have nothing else to do. 
Married. Have a house. Everything is pretty steady state but I feel dread every morning and purposeless. I know this is privileged to be complaining about this but I feel like I’ve grown up always working hard or toward the things I thought would make me feel better- the things I was supposed to do and I did them but I still feel stupid, and lonely, and I don’t know how to begin to get out of this slump. Ready to have kids but I don’t want to think having kids will magically fix everything when more often than not, it’ll do the opposite.

I didnt want to make too long a post but its going to be cause of my recent medical situation. About 4 years ago alot started happening to me and alot of ailments I have cant really be explained by docs, although some were. 4 years ago my dermatologists told me I have mild HS, a skin related auto immune disease that pretty much has ruined my life. Even though its ""mild"" form, without getting into it, it stops me from doing so much including being able to exercise like a normal person and hinders alot of day to day activity. After a failed treatment from that, I noticed a lump on my neck. It was an enlarged lymph node. Going from doctor to doctor, it was traced to my thyroid where, after a biopsy, I tested positive for thyroid cancer. Total thyroidectomy, radioactive treatment, finding the right balance of thyroid meds, blah blah, now im cancer free and my meds are the right dosage. tsh, thyoglobulin, free t3 all that stuff looks good on work ups. Ive suffered bad headaches my whole life as well and i also have a really badly hearniated disc (t6-t7) in my back that shoots down my left arm. Ok thats my history for the big stuff.

So around the time post surgery, i started getting these weeks where my chest would be tingly especially laying down and I just didnt feel like myself for the entire duration of the episode. Then a few epsidoes later I began getting a sinking feelings in my chest. It would have a slight buildup and then the drop. Feeling my radial pulse when it happened, i would feel a longer pause on a beat then a supercharged beat that would feel a bit heavier. Talking to both my primary and cardiologist, they didnt really seem to concerned. I did a halter monitor for a month, which showed a fair amount of PAC's but nothing concerning (to them) and 1 strip where they saw a supposed minor blockage (1 sample in a whole month). Again nothing concerning to professionals. I did an MRI with contrast. No cholesterol buildup or plaque and only thing remarkable was a PFO from birth. Also from about 3 years ago when i was trying a treatment for the HS, i started getting pain in my lower legs. This pain also spikes when im having one of these chest episodes. My cardiologist says my pulse in my legs feels fine. Ive also had a few sonograms of my legs and there was no restricted bloodflow. For some reason I also have hairloss on the outside of my legs when these episodes occur. Afterwards it starts to grow back, untill the next episode. My cardiologist said he couldnt explain it. :(

My primary put me on Cymbaltta (Duloxetine) bc she thought the palpatations were stemming from anxiety. They have not helped with these episodes. (Although I am in a better mood overall for someone who has all this stuff). First few weeks were a misery but Ive gotten used to the drug and now its ok, and im gonna continue taking it.

So currently I am in an episode. I cant 100% ID what sets them off but I have noticed maybe the days prior to them I arent eating the best foods especially in the sense of sugar. My A1C and bloodwork is always fine for diabetic related markers but this can be the only thing i see as a potential trigger. I dont drink coffee. I do drink diet soda and sometimes tea, but alot less caffeine then most. These are the rest of my symptoms right now and most are present when im having one of these episodes: (btw these last for a week- 2 weeks every month or 2 months)

\-Chest feels light, not painful, just slightly tingly

\- Eye sight is slighty blurry, like it takes an extra half second to focus on something after changing my view.

\- I feel a little dizzy when i walk around, like a minor vertigo like feeling. Very sluggish and lightheaded. Dont feel like im here. Dont feel normal at all.

\- I can have little breakouts of sweating even if its cool. Somewhat shorter of breath sometimes.

\- Pulse is more frequently on the tachy side, sometimes in the high 90s resting and sometimes its pronounced enough to where i can feel it.

\- I get a strange sensation on the front side of my left shoulder. Cant really describe it. Sometimes feels like its pulsating or tingling or tiny little bugs when i lay down.

\-Very Very Tired during these episodes. I can sleep 10 hours, wake up and need to go back to sleep a few hours later. Just cant stay up to save my life. I felt this way when i was off my thyroid meds during the months before the radioiodine. Same type of feeling.

\- Cold Extremities.

So yeah. Also after a shower the chest drop/ skipped beat thing is more frequent. But I havnt had an answer from any doctors. Tons of test and questions and I come to accept so many things that I have wrong but like this one is really getting to me and not a single answer. If anyone can maybe put it together I would appreciate it so much. To me it sounds heart related like a-fib or something but everything has checked out test wise. I dont mind sharing any tests if anyone wanted to look at something but I would love any sort of insight if anything sounds familiar.

1gmk7cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gmk7cd/girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_because_of_feelings/,Girlfriend broke up with me because of feelings but I think she lied?,"I was with this girl who’s 21 (I’m F24) for almost 6 months. We moved pretty quickly and even on our first date, it felt like I was spending time with someone I’ve known for a long time. Everything was going well for the most part - I met her family and friends and she met mine. We experienced a lot together in that period of time.

There were some things that she did that would annoy me and I’ll admit that I never communicated those things as they were just who she was and her ADHD. I’ll give some examples:

- She did not have her own bank account at 21 (uses her dad’s credit card) and had no sense of financial literacy even though I tried a few times to educate her and also offered to help her with any questions if she ever had any. 
- Whenever she would do laundry, she would have to dedicate her time to only that otherwise she would get distracted and forget about it. It would take her several days to do laundry because she would always forget a load is in the washer or dryer. 
- Her room was always messy with clothes on the ground
- There were times where she just wasn’t smart due to a lack of common sense at times. 
- She’s still in her sophomore year of college meanwhile I’ve been graduated for two years and have a job.
- She would forget to text me back for a few hours sometimes even if she was on her phone when I texted her. She said it was her ADHD that would make her forget. I did communicate that bothered me early into the relationship and I did compromise by texting her again if she hadn’t replied in a timely matter.

A few months into our relationship I started having doubts sometimes because I wasn’t sure if I could see a future with those things that would not change. But I had a lot of love for her, even if I wasn’t in love, and cared about her so much. Sometimes I would seem a little distant due to my depression and anxiety and I did try communicating better with her on that, but maybe it wasn’t enough. 

Anyways fast forward to last week, we went to dinner and I mentioned our 6 month anniversary that was coming up and that I wanted to take her out to a new place I thought she’d like. During that dinner and after when we went to hang out at my place, she seemed distant. Since that day, I had a gut feeling something was off as her communication style changed. I did try asking her a few times in the remainder of the week about how she was. She was telling me she was depressed and that it was seasonal depression, and also she was stressed with school.

I thought we were okay. She asked me when the next time I was free was and we set up a day to hang out. My gut was telling me something was wrong and I was overthinking the worst for days. But I was right.

She came over to my place crying. We sat down and she told me that she was thinking for the past week and she said she hadn’t felt the way she wanted to at this point of our relationship. Her feelings weren’t growing and it wasn’t something that I did or she did. I was just so shocked. She told me I was a really good person and deserve the best. She also said that we should go no contact for a few months and then maybe get coffee and catch up.

This hurt me so much. This was my first amicable breakup and even though it happened 4 days ago, it still hurts.

I did something unhealthy last night and stalked her social media and one of them consisted of a Twitter account that she’s shown me on her phone a few times but she didn’t think I would actually be looking at her Twitter account on my own since I don’t have Twitter. I saw that she had a post where she was in one of her college classes and she was supposed to write down qualities she wants in a partner and then she also put “POV me right after a breakup” with a picture of a paper that only had one quality written down “someone who can communicate”.

I can’t tell if she just lied to me when she was breaking up because if my poor communication was what caused her to lose feelings or/and not want to continue our relationship, she never said that. 

Even if I didn’t see a future for us romantically, I still wanted her in my life which is probably why I kept the relationship going. Hopefully we can be friends after no contact.

Anyway, a few of us go to a club afterwards and somehow we end up together in the parking lot, me in my car, him in his jeep, and he's all, ""wanna hang out?"" It's pretty clear what he wants and I do too. I happen to live close so I say sure, follow me.

Now, we're at my apartment. I offer him a drink and we chat a bit. He seems a little different now, talking sort of strangely. We hadn't talked too much though and I'm trying to get a handle on him. I ask a bit about him but his answers don't make a lot of sense. He doesn't seem like he's on anything, not slurring his words, but he's a bit robotic. Then he excuses himself to the bathroom.

I dash around, tidying up a little, put on some tunes, whatnot. Suddenly he opens the bathroom door and says, ""can you come in here?"" I walk over. ""What's up?"" The bathroom lights are off and he's standing in the bathroom with his pants down. ""Can you come in here with me while I go?"" Ummm...

""I uh -why?"" I reach over to turn on the lights.

""NO~!"" He screams at the top of his lungs. ""I NEVER go poop with the lights ON!"" He looks terrified.

""Um, okie. Ah, hm, I er-""

""Do you ever go with the lights off?"" He asks softly.

""I can't say that I do, no.""

""I have to.""

""Ok, well, I actually have to get back to the club to meet up with everyone. Maybe we can hang out another time?""

He pulls up his pants and says, ""Oh, ok, well, call me then"" really pleasantly. He hadnt of course given me his number. As I saw him to the door and double-locked it I promised to (never) call him as soon as possible!

1gmk4t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gmk4t2/i_was_catfished/,I was catfished ,"Few years back I had been having a decent back and forth with a guy. I'd been playing the long game with. He was cute af, seemed remarkably stable (I was 22 at the time, his profile said 24) for a guy on grindr and had all the right things going on. About a month into conversation we finally decided to meet up. We organised to meet at a cafe and have coffee.

To say I was keen to meet this guy was an understatement, I’d developed a crush on him and spent far too long on making myself look good. Date time rolled around and I showed up at the cafe a little early to scope the situation out etc. I got a message from him shortly after saying he was having car trouble and asked if I minded coming to his so we didn't have to bail on the date. I (rather stupidly) didn't see the issue here and went off to his place, it was only a few blocks over.

I got there, knocked on the door and was greeted by a guy in his early 50s.

""hey.... is C (him) here?"" I asked assuming this must be the guy's father.

""you're looking at him. Hello J (me), it's nice to meet you in person finally"" he said with what looked like a slight smirk

My world spun. A guy old enough to be my father had catfished me? He had spent a MONTH creating a young persona to... I didn't even know... lure me into meeting him? What the fuck was going on?!

He invited me in and I just stood there, gobsmacked. Then I heard a voice from inside the house call out

""C, is that J at the door?""

Another guy in his 50s appeared at the door and looked me in the eye and then looked me up and down. He made some kind of comment about me looking better in the flesh and encouraged me inside.

Robin Williams, basically . Although we didn't quite have the energy he had, but we essentially acted the way he acted on tv show interviews.

We'd talk in a cocky or goofy way using voices from characters like Captain Picard or Shrek or random cave man stuff. Even occasionally at work but usually just when hanging out with others and definitely when we were hanging out at one of our places watching dumb stuff like WWE or whatever.

As an adult, I guess I keep life interesting by still talking like that with my kids (they love it).........and even if I'm alone. Hell, I've done full David Attenborough narratives of me scrambling eggs as if it's some skill we developed over millions of  years of evolution. Except that my fake accent is horrid.

And the inevitable, I get caught by someone doing this when I think nobody else is around.

Happened today at work. Place was closed, and I thought I was the only one working extra hours today and I'm narrating my coffee making like Jeremy Clarkson.

He is energetic, active, caring and productive, but he also has temper. He might very quickly burst into anger out of nowhere, sometimes somewhat reasonably, other times absolutely not, literally over me clumsily spilling a bit of coffee over a (non problematic) floor or he might imply I meant something that I didn't and get mad without giving it a moment to check if there is a misunderstanding. This does not happen often, but it comes back from time to time and it's hard for me to let go. 

The thing that really bothers me is that when he is mad, he looks for the most hurtful things to say. He says I am disrespectful (thought typically he actually is), mocks me, screams to my face, calls me a victim, compares me to my mom cause he knows how problematic my relationship with her is and tries to provoke me. One time he asked if I have a printed copy of my face so he can put it on a boxing sack and go smash it. Today such episode happened before I was to take a nap (I had to get up at 5 am for work) and he called me a spoiled queen and that he hopes I'll have horrible nightmares. Whatever I say he manages to turn around as a fuel to feel more righteously mad at me. If I take a moment to think what to do, he will be angry that I don't respond.

During those episodes he feels really justified to his anger and since he perceives that I was the one who hurt him first, he gets double angry that I am not apologetic enough and angry back because of his responses and he wants my apology, but by the time these conflicts develop, I rather want HIS apology. And more so when most of the cases I find it completely unjustified and have to really try to find ways how I might have offended him. I also recognize that I have to be extremely careful to address sensitive topics cause I don't want to provoke these outbursts. 

Why I let it slide is that after a while when he comes down he typically comes to his senses and honestly apologizes and agrees that it is his problem. But it takes another while for me to get over it because it does hurt and I keep hearing those horrible things in my head. We otherwise have a good relationship and he is not as crazy as he may sound. 

My problem is that I come from a family with anger problems. I grew up in the surrounding of constant shouting, tension, alcohol abuse and little resolution so I don't know what is *normal*. I hear that every couple fights, that it is normal and I am sure that I am also not ideal here - I am very careful with my words, but I might be passive aggressive as everyone finds their way to battle. I wish to have more reasonable fights but does that even exist? Are such conflicts normal? Do you also fight like this? Are these red flags or just being a human?

Trans women face challenges every day that can be shocking, unfair, and even hurtful. And for me, it’s been one moment after another, reminding me that society can have a hard time accepting us as we are. But here’s the thing—I refuse to be reduced to someone else’s opinion or prejudice.

So, I’m here for change, and I’m here to make a choice for myself. This is why I’m joining the 4B Movement. I’m done pursuing relationships with cis men who can’t accept me. I’m tired of feeling like I’m chasing validation from people who see me as a debate rather than a person. It’s exhausting—and I know I’m not the only one who feels this way.

So to every trans woman out there, let’s take a stand. This subreddit is a safe space for us to share, grow, and support each other. We’re here to talk about our experiences, set our own rules, and rewrite our own narratives. Let’s build this movement together—where our stories, our struggles, and our victories matter.

Marcus and Elena Kovač moved like poetry on ice, their silver costumes shimmering under the spotlights, two hearts beating as one. For fifteen years, they had written their love story across frozen stages, their matching wedding rings catching arena lights like starlight on snow.

Their apartment walls held their journey: Elena at twelve, practicing until her ankles bled; Marcus watching her from afar, too shy to speak; their first dance together; the moment he proposed on their home rink, rose petals like drops of blood on ice.

""Dancing is our immortality,"" Elena would whisper, her fingers lingering on his chest before each performance, feeling his heartbeat match their routine's rhythm.

Their mornings began in darkness – shared coffee in matching mugs (""He's mine,"" ""She's mine""), quiet drives to practice, her head on his shoulder as she hummed their music. Their final piece was ""Swan Lake,"" choreographed by Elena herself, each movement a memory of their love. She'd sewn their costumes late into the night, weaving ""Forever"" in tiny crystals along the seams.

That last morning, Elena's coffee sat untouched. ""Just a headache,"" she smiled, leaving a lipstick mark on his cheek. During their third run-through, her hand slipped from his grasp like a dying butterfly.

""It was quick,"" the doctors said. Marcus held her cooling hand, still in his practice clothes. Her final words echoed: ""Ready for the death spiral, my love?""

Her skates hung in their locker, laces in her peculiar double-knot. Her pillow still carried the scent of lavender. At her funeral, Marcus danced their routine on the frozen lake, lifting invisible arms while families wept on shore.

He began haunting the rink at night, dancing until security changed the locks. He wore her old sweater despite its size, the sleeve frayed where she'd chew when nervous. People saw him gliding through streets, parks, parking lots, his bleeding feet leaving trails in snow.

""Do you see her?"" he'd ask strangers, eyes following something beyond. ""She's dancing now – she was always more beautiful on ice.""

One moonless winter night, he returned to their lake wearing their final costume, now worn and faded. A teenager's phone captured his last dance – a perfect ""Swan Lake."" Some swear the grainy footage shows two figures moving as one, a flash of silver, an echo of laughter.

They found him at dawn in their ending pose, Elena's lipstick tube in his pocket, ice cracked beneath him like unfurling wings. His face, peaceful at last, had shed the year's torment.

Now they rest together, silver skates tied with rose gold ribbon marking their grave. On competition nights, some hear blades on ice, counting whispers: ""One, two, three...""

1. you start to feel anxious about something, let’s say about doing bad on an upcoming test for example
2. as you start to feel anxious thoughts coming, you close your eyes and imagine a little you inside your body aka “shrink” yourself down (to me, it feels like a mini version of me in the control center of my body)
3. once you shrink yourself down, you think of things that you are 100% certain about in that very moment. in our test example, it could be a manta like “i am sitting at my desk. my coffee mug is half full. i am wearing fuzzy blue socks”. think of things that your shrunken down mini you can see
4. once you ground yourself, “unshrink” yourself by opening your eyes again

i know this won’t work for everybody, but it has helped me immensely when i start to feel a plethora of anxious thoughts coming my way. i think the closing my eyes and imagining a mini me in an empty control room helps a lot. there’s no room for anxious what-ifs if all my mini me can see is what is physically in front of me! it helps stop me from spiralling over something that might not even happen.

During peak, our DT OTW goal is 45 seconds. On Monday, I opened, finished my shift, went to college, got called back in to preclose (3-8pm).

Having this done meant that the openers didn’t have to do anything but put the food on display (I already put the food in the display, they just needed to open the items and plate them). 
I also got everything stocked on the bar side (filled the milk fridges, did all the back ups for the next day, made sure all the syrups are full). I stocked the cups and lids. I pretty much did ready-set-go. 
The next morning, their DT times were 35 seconds (we usually sit at 48-60 seconds). Ask they had to do was turn on the systems, calibrate the Mastrenas, pour the refreshers into their large servers, and brew coffee. 

Today, my SSV told me to stop filling the warming fridge so much and I can only restock it once in my shift. I usually restock half of it once and the full thing once in my 4.75-hour shift. She got mad when I restocked it once then refilled the wraps when they were empty again. 
I guess going forward, I’ll partially stock it once and partially refill it once or maybe not even do that.

I recently accepted an offer at Apple in Austin and I’ve decided to move down for it. I’m nervous but pretty excited.

1. Walkability (ideally, I can walk to at least one grocery store, one coffee shop, one park)
2. Decent commute to Apple’s campus in NW Austin
3. Decent commute to the Airport (I’ll be flying a lot)

1. West Downtown around 5th/West Ave
2. Area around Saltillo Plaza

Getting to the airport honestly doesn’t seem like a huge deal, and both seem pretty good for walking. I guess my big question is, would a daily northbound commute on the MoPac or 35 be worse?

Only $11 - $12 for white or black respectively, and comes with a metal scoop and rdt spray bottle which I haven't used so I don't know if it works. I just wanted to share with y'all.

1gmjqif,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1gmjqif/cant_breathe_properly/,Can't breathe properly.,"Hello. Long story short, I've had GERD for the past \~7 years, and it significantly worsened 2 years ago when I tried ""bulking"" on my own terms. As I've had this ""illness"" for a long time, I've researched tons of information and also read the ACW book. Unfortunately, I cannot follow this diet as it goes beyond my student budget, a lot of products not being available in my country, as well as ""losing weight"" seemingly being a priority in this book (I'm 6'8/203 cm., the last thing I want is to lose weight). I've made my own ACW diet following the list of alkaline foods to eat and I've been very strictly following it (I don't drink coffee, dropped out added sugars, etc.) for the past 3 weeks (the healing phase is supposedly 28+ days). I've been drinking omeprazole as well. Aside from the acidic taste from my mouth not disappearing at all, or my cherry-red throat, it is very difficult for me to breathe. I feel like something is stuck inside my throat all the time and is literally choking me. Every single day I wake up with acidic taste in my mouth, red, swollen bumps on the roof of my mouth (hell, my teeth are getting yellow from the amount of acid in my saliva). I've been to countless GI doctors (healthcare is free in my country), including private ones where I paid money well over my budget, but they either not care about the state of my health, or are unqualified to assess the situation, as all they do is provide me a leaflet of foods and lifestyle changes, even after countless mentions that I know everything in that leaflet by heart. I've been following this group for a while now, reading all the stories and people are very generous here, trying to help as much as possible - that's why I decided to ask for help as well. If any of you have any suggestions on what I should do, please, do write it. This whole thing is absolutely destroying me.",3,1731075988.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Here’s what I’ve learned: 

1. You’ll likely not be perfect at driving at this stage but that’s okay, try being predictable on the road instead. I know that I intend to and will continue to get better at driving the more I do it but realising that even experienced drivers make mistakes helped me take the pressure off from being “perfect” on the road.

2. On the subject of making mistakes, if they do happen on your test, that’s okay. The more important thing is how you handle it. Chatting to my examiner you’ll be surprised at how many people stall on their tests. I stalled once on an uphill slope with a road hump right before a mini roundabout. But you know what? Instead of panicking I secured the car with my handbrake and calmly handled the situation. It can be hard not to panic (on stressful work days I realise it’s even harder for me to keep calm) but if you’re able to control that panic response, it will take you far.

3. General recommendations: Be vigilant about your observations and vulnerable road users, tell as many or as few people as you want (which ever stresses you out less), avoid coffee if you can (this was a difficult one) and eat your banana (it really helps!)

The test goes by faster than you’d imagine, especially if you’ve had longer driving lessons. I managed to pass my test with one of the worst headaches I’ve had, if I can, you can too - To future test takers, whether it’s your first test or your seventh test, you’ve got this!",12,1731075819.0,LearnerDriverUK,2,1.0,False

Hello all, 

Another week, another shot! 

I am recently divorced. I work a lot. I’m an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I’m rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who’s serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I’m also an ass man so bonus points if you’re a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that’s me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs but I’m not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain’t going to work. 
A bit more about me below ⬇️ 

* 41, Caucasian, 6’1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you’ll meet. Period. 
* I’m a Dad of 2 beautiful kids. 
* I’m a big nerd, love space and comics, sci fi and horror. Games. 
* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you! 

Lastly, I know what I want & I know what I’m ready for. I’m getting tired of people telling ME that I’m not ready for something. The only person who can truly know that is myself. Same goes for you. I don’t want a penpal and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. 

I am looking for WOMEN ONLY.

1gmjilw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NickCave/comments/1gmjilw/memoir_of_a_snail_featuring_the_voice_of_nick/,"Memoir of a Snail, Featuring the Voice of Nick Cave, Out this Weekend","Memoir of a Snail is the first feature-length movie from Australian director/animator, Adam Elliot, in 15 years. But, perhaps most importantly--or, in this case, relevantly--it features the voice acting talents of one Nick Cave. I haven't heard him talk about it, so it might be flying under the radar for some fans. He even reads some poetry in the movie that reminded me of Little Empty Boat, just as a tease. 

I'm a film critic--and Cave fan--in the Houston Film Critics Society and reviewed the movie for my YouTube channel. I entreat you all to give it a watch: [https://youtu.be/-nveb5VfLsI](https://youtu.be/-nveb5VfLsI)

To give you a sense of the movie, Elliot's last movie was the critically acclaimed Mary and Max, and Memoir of a Snail is very much in the same aesthetic. It's a stop motion animated film, but it has a grungy visual style to match its more adult themes. There's a yellowish tint to the whole movie, like the film reel was used as a urinal cake. Whereas in another stop-motion movie, you might have adorable little figures of coffee mugs, violins, and cute bunny rabbits, Memoir of a Snail has little replicas of greyhound busses, topless old ladies, and snail semen. The style sort of reminds me of a stop-motion Ed Roth/Rat Fink. But for as much as Elliott likes to play in the stylistic dirt, the movie itself is incredibly heartfelt. It's sincere without ever being sentimental, and morbid without ever embracing depression.

P.S. I saw Cave and Warren Ellis in Austin two or three years ago and it was the best concert I've ever been to.  

P.S.S. I saw Gladiator II last night and will have a review of that up when the embargo lifts on Monday. As we all know, Nick Cave has some history with that movie that I'll be discussing in the video. ",6,1731075385.0,NickCave,0,0.88,False

There’s this twink who’s so far out of my league it’s laughable. I see him all the time – in the SLC, around campus, sometimes even at the gym – and it’s like he’s this gravitational force.

He’s gorgeous, but it’s not just that. It’s the way he looks so focused while she’s studying, like he’s on a mission to change the world. And then, every now and then, he’ll laugh with his friends, and it’s the most genuine, happy sound in the universe. I don’t know his name, or his major, or even what year he’s in, but I’m convinced he’s literally perfect.

I’ve tried making excuses to get close to him – pretending I was lost just to ask him for directions, standing near him in the library hoping he’d notice me, even “accidentally” bumping into him once. He just gave me a polite smile and kept going, like it was no big deal. Which, of course, to him it wasn’t. But to me? It’s the highlight of my week.

I know, I know – this sounds pathetic, right? And yeah, it’s not like I’m entitled to anything from him, or that he owes me the time of day just because I’m in my feelings. But every time I see him, it’s like this mix of pure awe and total frustration because I know it’ll never be more than that. He’s on her own path, doing his own amazing things, and I’m just… here. Existing in the same place as him and being absolutely torn up about it.

I don’t know if I’ll ever talk to him, and even if I did, what would I say? “Hi, I’ve seen you like 30 times, and you have no idea, but you’ve ruined every standard I ever had in a relationship. Want to grab coffee?” It’s a joke. He’s the sun, and I’m just some asteroid floating around, hoping for a bit of his light.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. I just needed to vent because this twink has me feeling things I haven’t felt in years, and I don’t know how to handle it.",17,1731075170.0,TorontoMetU,18,0.67,False
