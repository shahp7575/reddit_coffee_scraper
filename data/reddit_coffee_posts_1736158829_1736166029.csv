I’m blown away by my Pietro Grinder – it’s so precise and uniform that I can’t keep up! 😅 Right now, I can’t get my V60 brew time past 1:30. The results are super clean and juicy, but I feel like aiming for 2:00–2:30 would extract a bit more complexity.

I’m usually brewing at grind settings 5–8, sticking to 5–6 for funky naturals and 6.5–8 for washed coffees. Even with these adjustments, the flow rate is *super* fast. So far, I’ve tried both 1-pour and 2-pour techniques, but nothing seems to slow it down.

Has anyone else experienced this with the Pietro or other high-end grinders? Should I adjust the grind size even more, or are there other tricks to increase brew time without sacrificing clarity?",2,1736165341.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1huxkad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1huxkad/for_the_guys_long_asf/,For The Guys (long asf!!!),"So, I, (21f) have no idea wtf to do.

Long Story Short: I wanna know if guys actually have the ability to change their mindset?

Long Story: I was with my now ex for 2+ years before I broke up with him.  We have a baby together that was born 12/21, 2023. She is now a whole year old, but for over half of her life now we’ve been separated. Why??? Cause he could never manage to keep a job when he had one and it took him WELL over 6+ months of my pregnancy to get a job to provide for the incoming family.

I stressed and stressed over things like not being able to have our own place (we’ve literally couch hopped our entire relationship and have been homeless once), having no vehicle, (he had both the car I met him with repoed AS WELL AS the one I managed to save for, for us to have) and how he had lost his job halfway through my pregnancy.

With being diagnosed with BPD, and tons of pregnancy hormones, on top of all of this spiraling into the trenches, I was a major raging bitch. But at the end of the day, no matter what was said, I never- ever, let him go to sleep upset. I would always try to talk things out and explain through my scream fits and afterwards quietly, as to why I was so angry about not having everything right for us already. To me, everything made complete sense and I just could understand why he couldn’t kick it in gear like I could. Yet, he would never let me get a job while I was pregnant. I was stuck. Just hoping that he would and begging him to fix things for us.

Fast forward to after the baby is born, I continue to give him time to get a job and provide for us but he never manages. So I broke up with him and gave him time to get his stuff out. I always let him see the baby, and even provided multiple times for him to take care of her while there.

Even though I was still in contact every single day with him, I tried dating someone else after a couple weeks went by because some guy just ended up guy asked me out for coffee at work and only went on one date.

But I couldn’t stand being away from my ex, I pretty much bawled my eyes out to him 2 months after him being away and he came back so we can fix things. He was completely aware the whole time after the one guy that we were exclusive because I literally told him over the phone that I’m not even considering other people.

Well, turns out he was talking to a girl he had known in high school for a couple weeks before he moved back. He was talking about a life with this girl and her baby, as well as completely lying about me saying things like I physically abused him and my baby and that I’m some crazy baby momma that he just has contact with but she could never EVER talk to because I’d freak. She was in it DEEP with him, even talking about meeting my baby, but according to him it was nothing but a rebound and they never hooked up. Only met in person once. I found this out because she got suspicious and got in contact with me, finding out that it was all a lie.

Well, surprise! After hours of prying with information I already had for the next two days, he informed me that he cheated on me while I was 6 months pregnant; during those rage fits I told you about. He says it’s because of how personal he took them and the things I’d say. Which I can slightly understand. I wouldn’t want to be with someone who was acting like a psycho every day either. Especially if it’s being blamed on me, but I wouldn’t fucking cheat on them. I’d just leave.

But the one thing I absolutely can’t wrap my fucking head around about all of this, is how he can turn around and say that I’m all he wants; that I’m the love of his life; that I’m the most perfect girl in the world; that nobody looks better etc. etc. after all of this since we’re trying to see if this is worth saving.

Since I started finding out about things, he’s been completely honest, allows me on his phone 24/7(which was already okay but he still managed to cheat, yk?), and compliments me to high heavens. When I tell you that I could quite literally record him with a blindfold around his eyes and he’d be down on his knees saying every single bit of this is true, he would. But I’m to the point where I can’t tell if he’s be genuine or if he’s being a master manipulator to save his own ass and actually have a chance at the family he knows he fucked up with.

Idk. I have so many thoughts on this all and I’d just like another guy’s opinion. I don’t think it should matter much because it’s a matter of someone’s brain and not biology but what do I know??? I didn’t even know I was getting cheated on when he was coming home and kissing my belly after screwing a customer he met at his job.

I’m in mental anguish and turmoil over this and he’s getting to the point where he’s posting to Reddit about how I can’t seem to let things go yet it’s only been about two months (give or take) of him facing some consequences. I’m all about knowing you have to make love work for it to work, but I’m also stuck thinking ‘Do I really wanna be with the guy who cheated on me? Is he even being genuine about wanting me or us? Or does he just know that he doesn’t have a single thing to his name?’",1,1736165324.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1huxfs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1huxfs9/the_day_my_espresso_machine_became_my_archnemesis/,The Day My Espresso Machine Became My Arch-Nemesis,"Okay, so this happened a couple of weeks ago, and I’m still not over it. I’ve been trying to get my life together, and part of my “new me” routine is making coffee at home instead of spending half my paycheck at coffee shops. I bought this fancy espresso machine that makes lattes, cappuccinos, etc.

The first few days went great. I was frothing milk, making espresso shots, and feeling like I had my life together. But then came The Incident.

That morning, I was half-asleep and running late for work, so I decided to try a new recipe I’d seen online. It involved using the steam wand to heat the milk while the espresso brewed simultaneously. Multi-tasking! What could go wrong, right?

Apparently, everything.

I set up the milk pitcher under the wand, pressed a bunch of buttons on the machine, and stepped away to grab my travel mug. That’s when I heard this terrifying hissing noise. I turned around just in time to see the steam wand shooting milk everywhere. I panicked and rushed to fix it, but instead of turning it off, I somehow switched it to turbo mode.

Now, there’s hot milk spraying all over my kitchen, and I’m standing there, flailing like an idiot. I finally grab the pitcher to stop it, but it’s too hot, and I end up dropping it. The milk splashes all over the counter, the floor, and somehow the ceiling.

At this point, I’m covered in milk, my kitchen looks like a crime scene, and my espresso shot has overflowed and flooded the machine. In my panic, I tried to clean it up with paper towels, but they got stuck in the milk puddle and turned into this gross, soggy mess.

I was so late for work that I had to throw on a hoodie, grab a granola bar, and leave the milk disaster for later. When I got home, the kitchen still smelled like burnt milk, and I had to scrub the ceiling for an hour.

So yeah, my attempt to save money on coffee ended with me spending $50 on cleaning supplies and seriously questioning my life choices.",1,1736164871.0,stories,0,1.0,False

","Let’s get real for a second: Tom DeLonge’s time in blink-182 has been a mixed bag, but it’s abundantly clear that Matt Skiba brought a breath of fresh air that the band desperately needed. If you’re still clinging to the notion that Tom is the superior singer and songwriter, it’s time to face the harsh truth: you’re living in a nostalgic fantasy. 



First off, let’s talk about Skiba’s vocal abilities. While Tom’s voice has this whiny, nasally quality that some people might find charming, it often veers into the territory of nails on a chalkboard. Skiba, on the other hand, has a versatility that Tom just can’t touch. His vocals are more refined and powerful, and they bring a level of emotional depth that Tom’s lackluster delivery simply can’t achieve. If you prefer sound over substance, maybe you should consider whether you understand music at all.



When it comes to songwriting, let’s not kid ourselves—Skiba has a knack for crafting lyrics that resonate. While Tom’s lyrics can often feel juvenile and repetitive, Skiba’s contributions have added layers and complexity. “Bored to Death” is a prime example: it’s a thoughtful reflection on aging and disillusionment that Tom’s more simplistic, adolescent-themed songs can’t compete with. If you’re still holding on to those cringe-worthy “What’s My Age Again?” vibes, it’s time to grow up.



And let’s not forget the elephant in the room: Tom’s priorities. He’s off chasing UFOs and living in a sci-fi fantasy world, while blink-182 flounders. Seriously, does anyone think that’s a good look for a band that once defined a generation? If he’s more interested in aliens than in his own band, it’s time to hand over the reins. Blink-182 doesn’t need a frontman who’s more fascinated with extraterrestrial life than with producing quality music. The band deserves someone who’s fully committed, and Skiba has shown time and again that he’s in it for the long haul. What the fuck do you even call these last two projects?



To anyone who dares to disagree, are you seriously still stuck in the past? The glory days are over, and clinging to Tom’s misguided vision is only holding the band back. It’s like watching a car crash in slow motion—painful and embarrassing. If blink-182 wants to regain some semblance of relevance, they should consider giving Matt Skiba the full rights to the band. He’s the one who’s actually delivering quality music and keeping the spirit of blink-182 alive while Tom is busy playing intergalactic conspiracy theorist in between chugging beers and rushing through 'blink-182' sets.



Let’s face it: if you’re still rooting for Tom, you’re not just living in denial—you’re actively sabotaging the band’s potential.

________________________
The Olympics is the only time I ever feel sorry for white people. Every year, you see the lineup for the 100 metres—men, women, doesn’t matter. It’s always some smooth coffee with a few sprinkles of sugar, lost in the mixture. And then the race starts, and so does the racial segregation Malcolm X dreamed of.

But then you see that one sprinkle of sugar, refusing to dissolve. Sure, you know they’re not gonna win, but 5th place? Pfft, you’ll take that all day. You’re suddenly cheering, ’Come on, show ‘em how mediocre we can be!’ Because, let’s face it, a white guy coming 5th in the 100 metres? That’s the equivalent of a black guy making it to the end of a horror movie… set on a plantation

Hope you're all well.  I'm new to matcha and the first few days I had a cup in the morning I felt great.  Only had about 1/4 teaspoon as I have no other caffeine at all.  Upped this to the adviced 1/2-1 teaspoon and had a massive caffeine rush for a few hours.  I have never drunk coffee and the tea I previously drank was steeped so was a lot less caffeine.  I guessing I should go back to 1/4 teaspoon right and take it from there?  Really felt great but not buzzed the first few days so hoping to get back to that level.  Hope some of you veterans got a little lol from this. :D

Thanks in advance.

1hux5h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/1hux5h1/how_chemical_reactions_deplete_nutrients_in/,How chemical reactions deplete nutrients in plant-based drinks,"*A University of Copenhagen study of plant-based drinks reveals a common issue: they are lacking in proteins and essential amino acids compared to cow’s milk. The explanation lies in their extensive processing, causing chemical reactions that degrade protein quality in the product and, in some cases, produce new substances of concern.*

*In the study, researchers examined how chemical reactions during processing affect the nutritional quality of ten different plant-based drinks, comparing them with cow’s milk. The overall picture is clear. .. “We definitely need to consume more plant-based foods. But if you’re looking for proper nutrition and believe that plant-based drinks can replace cow’s milk, you’d be mistaken,” says Department of Food Science professor Marianne Nissen Lund, the study’s lead author.*   

*Long shelf life at the expense of nutrition: While milk is essentially a finished product when it comes out of a cow, oats, rice, and almonds require extensive processing during their conversion to a drinkable beverage. Moreover, each of the plant-based drinks tested underwent Ultra High Temperature (UHT) treatment, a process that is widely used for long-life milks around the world. In Denmark, milk is typically found only in the refrigerated sections of supermarkets and is low-pasteurized, meaning that it receives a much gentler heat treatment. UHT treatment triggers a so-called “Maillard reaction”, a chemical reaction between protein and sugar that occurs when food is fried or roasted at high temperatures. Among other things, this reaction impacts the nutritional quality of the proteins in a given product.*

*“Most plant-based drinks already have significantly less protein than cow’s milk. And the protein, which is present in low content, is then additionally modified when heat treated. This leads to the loss of some essential amino acids, which are incredibly important for us. While the nutritional contents of plant-based drinks vary greatly, most of them have relatively low nutritional quality,” explains the professor. For comparison, the UHT-treated cow’s milk used in the study contains 3.4 grams of protein per liter, whereas 8 of the 10 plant-based drinks analyzed contained between 0.4 and 1.1 grams of protein. The levels of essential amino acids were lower in all plant-based drinks. Furthermore, 7 out of 10 plant-based drinks contained more sugar than cow’s milk.*

*Besides reducing nutritional value, heat treatment also generates new compounds in plant-based drinks. One such compound measured by the researchers in four of the plant-based drinks made from almonds and oats is acrylamide, a carcinogen that is also found in bread, cookies, coffee beans and fried potatoes, including French fries. “We were surprised to find acrylamide because it isn’t typically found in liquid food. One likely source is the roasted almonds used in one of the products. The compound was measured at levels so low that it poses no danger. But, if you consume small amounts of this substance from various sources, it could add up to a level that does pose a health risk,” says Marianne Nissen Lund.*

2024. We had unofficially lived together before this due to me being a student and having my own studio, she would come up and stay with me for long periods of time. In March of 2024 she started a full time job in the city I lived in so we agreed she would secretly live in my studio with me (we had no problems or arguments despite it being such a small space). Fast forward to now, we are living in our own flat and we have started dog sitting.
Due to me being a student, l am home 3/5 (work) days of the week and when I do go in to University, it is only for a few hours (2-4).
Because of this, mixed with my partner working full time (she works in the office and from home) it has become an unspoken rule that I do most of the house work. I would like to emphasise that this doesn't bother me. I appreciate that we have different schedules so I am happy to do most of the work around the house, this includes washing the dishes, cooking, making lunch, and going out to do shopping (she doesn't drive yet). Along side this, when we have a dog, I am usually the one to walk it and feed it, which again, is no problem since my girlfriend is in work/is working at her desk.
Here is the problem, acts of service is my love language. So although I am happy and want to do these things for her, I find myself feeling like I don't have the same reciprocated. I do these things, not only to make our space nice and clean, but to make her life easier. In the mornings before work, I will pack her work bag, I would get up at half 6 and make her breakfast (although, not now since she has stopped having breakfast), and make her iced coffees when she's working from home. All of these things are things I love to do, so don't get me wrong I am not complaining! But I sometimes find myself wanting something back to maybe make my life easier too. I have brought this up to her and we discussed some possible ways she could do that, the only thing we could think of was her making breakfast for us both when she gets up in the morning. I agreed to this but also voiced my concerns since she is not a morning person so she will get up at the very last minute she possibly can (also partially due to her often struggling to fall asleep).
Since having that conversation a while ago, she has done it once or twice. I want to make it known that she is the most loving, caring person i've ever met so this is not because she is lazy or doesn't want to do things for me, when we spoke about it she got upset and said she feels awful that I feel like this and it's just because she's so tired from work all the time, which I can empathise with completely. It is also worth mentioning her job is at a law firm so not the easiest of jobs!

So l was wondering if I could get advice on how to feel a bit more taken care of myself without her doing strenuous tasks or chores atter a long day of work. Last little note, but she never fails to give cuddles and kisses and all that cutesy stuff which is another love language of mine so l don't feel completely neglected! She is a wonderful person and an amazing partner, I am just struggling with coming up with solutions.

In an effort to keep myself accountable, I will make regular posts on my journey.

I am 37M, 167cm, and about 70.2kg. I am a skinny fat with now a round belly which I am trying to get rid of. My lifestyle is very sedentary since I work in tech. And despite having a gym in my condo, I also have zero motivation to go get exercises.

Used to do slow carb, but god, I can’t stomach the legumes constantly (now I hate them). Besides, being able to do just 1-2 “cheat"" days a week to eat normally was torture (even though I wasn’t binge eating unhealthy food). For some reason, fasting is more natural to me and I used to fast 2-3 days on just a few dates and a couple bowls of watery lentil soup without any issues. So here I am.

I know I’m probably gonna get called out on doing dirty fasting, or for doing 24H instead of 36H. My goal is to increase to 36:12 gradually. And hopefully I will be able to do just purely water, tea, and coffee without any sweeteners soon.

So far:

* 70.2kg starting weight
* 12 hours into fasting
* Consumed 2 small bowls (Asian small bowl) of bone broth I cooked myself (just beef bones with a dash of Dashi, half onion and a couple garlic cloves)
* Drank 2 cups of Earl Grey and 1 cup of decaf coffee
* Took 6 capsules of psyllium husk (helps with filling the stomach since it’s all fiber)
* 1 small-sized cucumber (around 100gr)

Hope to keep this up and get to my target weight of 60kg in 2-3 months!",0,1736163155.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,0.5,False

&nbsp;

I dashed frantically, shouting and waving my arms, hoping the transit bus driver would spot me in the rearview mirror and wait for me to cover the thirty more feet to the door. But as expected, I was not so fortunate, and all my effort sprinting and acting like an escaped lunatic was for naught. As I approached the door of the transit bus, it pulled away, leaving me standing there. Rather than wait an hour for the next bus, I decided to walk home.

I made my way to the corner, and as the light changed, I began to cross the street. A number of people were on the opposite side with determined looks etched on their faces, as though they were on some life-or-death mission. As they passed, one of them shoulder-checked me rather than taking half a step to the side as they approached. I was not impressed and turned to give him a dirty look, but he was too focused on getting to his destination to notice.

Twenty minutes had passed, and I was leaving the downtown core, entering the neighborhood that came before mine. The day was overcast and dreary, and it had been raining off and on all day. I was hoping to get home before the next shower. My mood was finally starting to recover from the missed bus and the shoulder check when I heard a roar—the sound of a dump truck's tires tearing through a deep puddle I failed to notice by the roadside.

There was a fence on the other side of me, so there was nowhere to duck for cover. Before I knew it, I was bombarded with a four-foot-high wave of muddy, ice-cold water. Drenched to the skin, I stood there, gazing at the truck and its driver as they drove off, oblivious to my predicament. I felt irrationally angry, even though I knew there was no valid direction for my frustration. The cold, muddy water seemed to penetrate my very being. Slowly, I began walking forward again, anxious to get beyond the puddle before another vehicle came by.

To add insult, a chilly breeze chose that moment to torment me as I took one squishy step after another toward home, which was still a long way away.

""Hey! Young fella!"" I heard an old man's voice call out from behind me. I turned to see him standing in his front doorway, gesturing for me to come over. ""I saw what happened. C'mon then, let's get you dry before you catch your death.""

I was flabbergasted. Was this guy really inviting me—a muddy, drenched stranger—into his home? The breeze was picking up into a gust, and I was in no position to say no. Embarrassed to even be seen in such a state, I squelched my way to the old man's house.

As I got to his door, he said, ""There ya go. Don't worry 'bout the mud. The bathroom's at the end of the hall. I'll grab some towels for you. Go ahead and have yourself a shower.""

I blinked at him in disbelief before stammering, ""Th-thank you. You're most kind.""

""Don't sweat it, sonny. I know what it's like to have 'one of those days.'""

I smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude and understanding, and made my way slowly to the bathroom.

""You can use the robe that's in there. We'll put your clothes in the laundry when you're done.""

I felt overwhelmed by this man's generosity; it was beyond anything I had ever experienced.

""Thank you so much, mister,"" I said.

""The name's John. And what do I call you, young fella?"" he replied.

""Randy. It's a pleasure to meet you, John,"" I answered.

""Okay now, move along. You're dripping on my floor,"" he said with a smile.

I entered the bathroom at the end of the hall, ashamed of the mess I was leaving in my wake. I stripped off my wet, muddy clothes and stepped into the shower. After I was done, I dried off and put on the robe that was hanging on a hook on the back of the door. I heard a knock and John's voice saying, ""If you're decent, I have a bag for your clothes.""

I quickly emptied my pockets onto the counter, bundled my clothes, and opened the door to accept the garbage bag. I placed the clothes within and handed it back to John, who was holding a mop. Gingerly, I stepped over the muddy puddle where I had initially removed my clothes and made my way to the kitchen table. There were two cups of coffee waiting, their warm, inviting scent calling to me as I sat down and watched the vapors waft up toward me.

""By the look of you, I figured you're a black coffee kinda guy,"" he said from down the hall, where he had gone to mop up the last of the muddy water in the bathroom.

""You figured correctly. Thank you again, John. This is too kind.""

""Mah,"" he said. ""Don't worry about it. I've been there.""

A moment later, he returned to the kitchen and sat down across from me. There was a moment of awkward silence, driven by my still-awestruck frame of mind at John's kindness and compassion.

""So, Randy,"" he said finally, ""were you on your way home?""

""Yes,"" I replied. ""I work downtown.""

""Well, when your clothes are clean and dry, I'll give you a lift. It's lookin' to rain again soon.""

""That would be above and beyond. Thank you,"" I replied.

""Mah,"" he said again. ""Ain't nothin'. Besides, I got nothin' but time. You hungry? I've got wafer cookies.""

At this point, I felt it would be rude to say no, though I couldn't help but feel I was taking advantage.

""Uhm, sure. That sounds good.""

John stood up and got us both some cookies as I sipped away at my cup of joe. I've never enjoyed a cup of coffee so much, its warmth drawing the chill from my bones and disposition.

John and I spent the next hour talking. I learned that he was a former veteran. During our conversation, John showed me his war medals and pictures of his grandchildren and niece. I spoke of my own family and hobbies. It was just nice. I had never connected with a stranger so quickly before, and the generation gap posed no obstacle.

Once my clothes were dry, I changed into them, and John drove me home in his big brown '70s Oldsmobile—a car that somehow seemed to reflect his personality. After that day, I made it a point to stay in touch with John, and the next time we met, it was to thank him by treating him to a nice dinner at Moe's Diner.

I've never forgotten that day and all that this old timer did for me. I think something in me changed after that day. It just seems more natural to me now to extend a helping hand, even to people I don't know. I hope the change is permanent because I don't want to forget how good it felt to get a hand up when I really needed it.

I did take him to the vet when this started. It appeared to be a consequence of over breeding, mixed with the fact he was the runt and malnourished as a pup as such. Puppy mills need to be stopped. I've rescued ever since. Side bar. Sorry.

Omg he's seriously the sweetest ) there is options like amputation and a wheelchair but I was about 20 at the time now and I literally had zero dollars until my 30s. So being as the vet assured me it was painless, and the dog weighed 3lbs and rolled around with me in the sleeve of my sweaters (seriously , he was the size of a large coffee mug ) I figured no big deal he's a prince. He doesn't need to walk anywhere on his own. 

I proceeded to purchase a thermal bed and some dishes that could be in the bed and not spill and honestly the dog lived his best life with his weird crooked legs mmmk. 

Well fast forward to Victim being about 7. 7 years I've had my boy and about 3 he's had gimpy legs and him and I had it all figured out. He was a happy boy. 

Well my MIL who knows everything and makes all the decisions because we were clearly not smart enough ( to be clear her narcissistic meatball of a son was 26 years old so we weren't both kids and I'd been on my own a while ) thought the dog should be put down from day one and VICTIM was causing our relationship (her son and i) problems. It was not his verbal and mental abuse or his addiction issues . Nope it was Victims legs. Smart lady, go home.

Well one stormy night, the Narcissistic Meatball (NM) started yet another one of his organically curated gaslighting tantrums and I had had enough and fled to a friend's apartment. (Couldn't bring dog due to her apartment rules and me not knowing how long I needed to be there )

Two days later I called to say I need to come pick up Victim. The response to this day puts my heart in an absolute vice. "" My mom took care of Victim for you. You knew it was time and you just couldn't put him out of his misery"" 

Friends. I have recently started therapy and received a PTSD diagnosis that was solely stemmed from my parents and this family. I confronted her. Boy did I confront her. I asked where his collar was. Where was his ashes he was to be cremated WHEN HIS TIME CAME. 

She responds "" well I didn't know you'd want the collar and the ashes ""

He's just. Gone. Forever. From that day. My dog. My peace. My parental love replacement. 

This was in 2011. I left immediately. I am apparently still healing. 

My advice... The minute mommy dearest gets involved and he doesn't stand up for ANYTHING. It's a trap. GTFO NOW. Before they start deciding they get to play god as well. They WILL go that far.

1. The Stew Crew finally dropped their fake Christmas vlog which featured several sets of Christmas PJs, Evan racing thru Luke Chapter 2, the kids reciting their lines without looking at each other, side eyeing the wall of cameras and a subtitled rambling prayer from Layla that was anything but genuine. No one was overly excited to receive more crap and Evan said he just set up the camera and they went on with their day… sooo, what do they normally do? He also said he and Carlin don’t give each other gifts bc they can just go get what they want whenever. In Nashville we see the big Stewart family gift exchange and Evan recruited his Brother in law to film with the selfie stick so not one angle is missed. Zade finally had his speech evaluation at the Children’s Hospital and surprise, surprise… he needs some therapy. Carlin pretends to be choked up as she pukes out all of her child’s private medical business. The mini vlog is the hot new trend and Carlin films herself taking down her Christmas decorations with links for every storage product. The Stewarts spend NYE with the cult pastor and his chosen ones at his home. If learning about Zade’s speech therapy wasn’t intrusive enough now we learn that Carlin is potty training him. This is the longest the stew crew has stayed home in months and they are getting antsy so they load up and head to film inside of a movie theater. Because they are finally at home, Evan is able to edit and get out a second Vlog. We see them searching for new cars at a Cadillac dealership and back at Tesla where Carlin tells us she really loves the Tesla. Evan uses the wording “crashed the Tesla” so does that mean it was their fault?? In any case, they head off to the ATV resort for Gil‘s birthday where Carlin gives him a new iPhone and then falls all over herself explaining why she bought it and how she hopes daddy dearest will love it. They are promoting an app that helps you cancel unused memberships and then they also want you to sign up for a monthly grocery membership… Evan jumps on the latest TikTok trend with another odd/wrong reel featuring Layla. This time it’s the “we listen and we don’t judge” trend that forces Layla to admit she is naughty and Evan to admit he behaves like a 10-year-old. The crowd goes wild for the blatant exploitation. Carlin shares a clip from Gil‘s birthday party featuring her mom reading off the spacing between each of the 19 kids and I feel like that came straight from Reddit.

2. Katie Clark loves to film her children in the bathtub and she shows us baby Harvey in the tub at three months old. At three months, Harvey has a bigger digital footprint than most 40 year olds. She celebrates the new year by featuring a video looking back at 2024 — she says she is proud of herself because she grew an entire human… no one gives awards for that in this family. The Vlog for the week has Travis telling us they took the week off and filmed nothing in New Jersey… he is standing outside of his parents mansion as he tells us this so maybe the Clarks said no filming. Travis and Katie show us glimpses of Gil‘s 60th birthday party where we see Zach and Lawson raining praises on Gil. We also see Kelly asking Travis or Evan to lead them all in Christmas carols and she quickly throws Lawson in at the end. We see your subtle shade Kelly... both Travis and Haley are sick after the party. While scratching around for content, the Clarks find Hailey‘s lion Halloween costume, dress her in it and head to waffle house… They film the entire event. Travis jumps into the mini Vlog trend by sharing a day in the life. We see him zooming away from his family in his red Tesla, heading to Nashville where he laughs and plays all day with some other YouTube singers. He has a leisurely lunch and then heads home. How long is Katie going to allow these solo trips??

3. Josie Balka eases back onto social media after her entire family came down with the flu on Christmas night. She has a year-end review that reveals them purchasing land in May. We see the real estate closing and the entire family enjoying a picnic on the new property… Erin must be furious. Josie says the girls are suffering with ear infections after the flu and shows us Kelton’s cappuccino art… She does not mention her dad‘s birthday at all. Instead, she tells us she is going to start waking up before her kids, shows off her fancy new coffee machine, her workout with Carlin, her tradWife apron and her sourdough cinnamon rolls.  The mini Vlog is the way for influencers to attract new followers… Stories are for the followers you already have. Josie‘s mini Vlog shows her cleaning her house in one hour and holy hell is it a disaster. It looks like a Walmart and Amazon warehouse exploded. She is cleaning out cabinets and donating coffee mugs… Could that be a first step towards moving?

4. Alyssa Webster is persona non grata with the entire Bates clan. A few of her siblings recite Kelly Joe’s script about where Alyssa was for her dad‘s big birthday and Christmas with her family, but most of them don’t mention her at all. She is preparing for a trip by letting her niece do her nails and she shows off Allie playing with a toddler tracing toy. Later, we see the Websters on a plane with the girls in matching coats and Allie in charge of pushing Rhetts stroller. The Websters are going to MAGA country (D.C.)and can’t get there fast enough. On the weekly Vlog, we see John and Alyssa side-by-side with their sad faces on. John tells us that they are saying goodbye to their YouTube channel because they need to protect their children from… negative comments. They hem and haw and do a lot of doublespeak to basically say they won’t be on YouTube unless it’s for a special occasion, or there’s something they want to share… The video ends with the words “Like, Subscribe, Share” so something tells me they are just pouting and will be back. Alyssa posts her goodbye video and then heads to Instagram to exploit her children fully on their vacation. She shows pictures of them touring Washington and with Taliban Dan at his swearing in ceremony. For some reason, Alyssa is dressed in a mid 90s prom dress for this event and the girls are wearing old lady stockings —so some things never change. She does close down the commenting on the posts and their YouTube. The sad hat website is also gone… that may be the quickest failure in all of fundie land. Alyssa will be back because she craves the attention and she’s done this before, but it is entertaining to watch child exploiters have a temper tantrum and threaten to quit.

5. Whitney Bates is working hard for Bates Sisters  Boutique, even when no one else seems to be. She tries on a bunch of sweatsuits they are selling for $80-$100 each … never mind that the same suits are available on Amazon for 25 to 50 bucks. She also attends and promotes a new hot yoga class in the Knoxville area. Zach turns 36 years old and starts posting more to his Bates Kitchen account. On his stories, he tells us that his children were all sick after Gil’s big birthday event, and I am sensing a trend… Michael shows up on his cooking Vlog again, this time to make her easy lasagna. She is way cleaner and neater than him and seems pretty comfortable in front of the camera. Speaking of the camera… It is shaking all over the place and he must have Bradley back there working as his camera man. Michael’s secret ingredient for her lasagna is cottage cheese plus extra meat… Of course.

6. Lydia and Trace celebrate New Year’s Eve with her family. They have baked cheese and tons of fondue. In their weekly Vlog they are at Gil’s big birthday party. Trace interviews Jane Jane, who tells him she has not seen Jackson in a long time and it seems she forgot totally about Alyssa. He also corners Erin for an interview and she tells him she has cried buckets of tears because they can’t come home to Tennessee. She desperately throws out the idea that she and Trace could go together and purchase a piece of land… Trace giggles nervously through it. He also interviews Evan, who seems to be uncomfortable in the crowd. Evan complements his camera and Trace says it is nothing compared to Evan’s set up.  Evan talks to the camera and says people will see this party from about five different perspectives. What a fun time… Cameras constantly rolling and nothing to talk about except cameras.

7. After months of dry begging, the Paine family dodged homelessness, and finally have a place to live… In Florida. In a subdivision. On a golf course. It is a bona fide nightmare for Erin and her face shows it.  Erin films Chad frantically packing a moving truck with whoever they can scrape together to help… Anyone except her. Her job seems to be filming and giggling and whispering to herself that she will be OK. Chad clenches his jaw and explains to the camera that this is God’s will… It never seems to be God‘s will for this man to get a job and support his children. At the new house, the Paine kids go wild and instead of six children, it appears to be a dozen! They quickly spread out all over the new backyard, climbing like crazy in the orange tree and running all over the golf course. There is no HOA, but guaranteed there are neighbors that are shaking in their boots. Erin has to stay behind in Tennessee while Chad heads back to Florida to finish their monumental move. We see Gil setting up a bounce house inside of the big house to try and entertain Erin’s children. Later, she shows off her dad’s chalk art at his church. I was totally expecting the hidden picture in Gil’s chalk art to be a sign saying “go your ass home!”

8. Michael and Brandon have a new Vlog on YouTube recapping their Christmas break in Michigan and their trip to the ATV park for her dad‘s birthday and Christmas. It is obvious that these two are the worker bees for all of Kelly’s ideas. They tell us that while everyone else participates in Gil‘s birthday, they babysit all of the nieces and nephews. They decorate cookies, play games and run Brandon up and down a hill until he falls out. They announce that in the new year, they will switch from drawing animals and Bible stories to full on vlogging and plan to have a video every other week. Michael is ready to accept sponsorships and start making that sweet influencer money.

9. Tiffany Bates is celebrating her dad’s 70th birthday by sharing lots of pictures on social media. She also explains again how grateful she is for him and her mom being there for her after the birth of baby Will. She is a shade assassin by pointedly saying her parents and Lawson were the only three people there for her. She also points out that baby Will is named for her dad and capitalizes each letter of his middle name…DANIEL. There is no new Vlog from Lawson and Tiffany, but Lawson shows up in many of his siblings videos wearing skinny jeans and black boots at his dad‘s birthday party. He is in charge of heaping praises on Gil and points out that his dad should have charged more for his services through the years. We see Lawson holding baby Will opening his Christmas presents, but Tiffany is nowhere to be seen… not even right beside Esther, her best Bates friend. She is spotted standing behind Lawson as he films… could she have been at the party and just not feeling well?  She did spend the entirety of the holidays reminding everyone how last holiday season she was pregnant and no one knew it. Soon enough, they are back to their usual cringe selves, making reels showcasing Lawson as the studley husband and Tiffany as the airhead wife.

10. Kelly Jo is now a full fledged influencer. She tags and promotes the ATV resort that hosted Gil‘s 60th birthday. Apparently, the owners are members of their church and gave them the cabins in exchange for promotion. Kelly has a pat answer for her three missing children at the party… Jackson had to work, Josie‘s family was sick and Alyssa‘s family already had travel plans. It’s like a game of “two truths and a lie”… only it’s “two lies and a truth”. She also thanks her coparents, Brandon and Michael, for all of their help. KJ is busy promoting her kids Vlogs and thanks everyone who helped Erin’s family move… She is very happy they have good friends, because they dang sure do not have a mother who is coming to help.  Kelly also posts pictures showing that Warden gave JebJud a new bow now that he is healed from his shoulder surgery. Bets on how long until a new injury occurs?? 

Have a great week friends!

1huwvds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1huwvds/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting ,"We’ve been married 5 years and I’m tired of his on again off again love . We went on a friends (couples) trip to Japan . Night one he tells everyone how much he loves me and how I’m the best thing that happened to him . Everyone was so cute and happy for us . 

Post that , everyday he wakes up he needs 2 hours to himself where I’m not allowed to speak to him or ask any questions until he gets a coffee and smoke . We were travelling in a group and I obv had questions for what time we are heading out etc . He’d keep snapping at me each morning . I tried ignoring it and focusing on the good parts . 

When we went shopping he had the cash and he would just disappear into thin air and I’d have to wait for him to show him things I wanted to buy . And he would snappily pay and then disappear again . Mind you I shop sensibly . I was trying to be calm all through . 

Next came another restaurant where we were walking together somewhere it was really crowded and he just abandoned me in the middle of it all to get a photograph . When I said hello I was walking with you , he goes “I can’t do everything with you” . This is after I Gave him all the space in the world . I have anxiety and I stress a little in crowded places . 

Next we go to a mall and all our friends spread out with their partners. We walk into a high end store and to my dismay my card won’t work . It worked everywhere else with a tap but here it was asking for a pin . My husband goes and sits far away from me when I’m trying to connect to WiFi to then connect to my bank app to fix this. He watched me struggle doing this instead of just getting up and offering to pay or at least help me figure the pin . (FYI my phone didn’t have internet) I finally figured it out with WiFi and on the way out he says congrats you got it . And I was so pissed by this point I said why didn’t you help me figure and he goes “it’s not my problem you forgot your pin” 

I was so deeply saddened and i just couldn’t take this mean behaviour anymore . I literally had tears running down my face . And guess what all our friends saw. And he just left me in the mall again and walked out leaving me with the girls. 

When we finally spoke about this later in the room he says , I’m too sensitive and I “purposely” find reasons to feel bad about things and he can’t do “everything” with me and I should learn to suck it up and give him space every morning until he has his coffee  . 

We are back home now and I can’t even look at him anymore because all I remember from this holiday is the bad times .

1huwp65,https://i.redd.it/mbqefbmswcbe1.jpeg,Am I overreacting or is this normal ,"This is how my boyfriend texts the girl he used to flirt with. She called me a week ago, telling me how he's an awful guy who cheats, gaslights people, and is toxic. I told him about it because the girl is someone I used to talk with, and we followed each other and hung out. But she later saw pictures of me and my boyfriend and told me a bunch of terrible stuff about him. I questioned him about it, and he said she was lying. Suddenly, today he shows me this text saying he'll talk to her and ask why she said all those things about him.

I just don’t get how you can be all friendly with someone that said nasty stuff about and text them like this ?? I got mad at him and ask how he would feel if an ex DMs me like this ",0,1736161932.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.33,False
1huwodn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1huwodn/coffee_shop_man/,Coffee Shop Man,"I've been forcing myself to do things that make me uncomfortable and one of them is asking guys out in public. The last time I did this, I found out the guy is actually bi and we had a short but really amazing relationship. 

A few weeks ago, I was at a coffee shop and kept matching eyes with this one dude. The difficult thing is I live in Germany and staring just happens. It is no indication of attraction and people don't ""flirt"" here like they would in another country. 

Anyway, as he was leaving, my friends encouraged me to get his number and I did. I complimented his hair and asked where one can get a decent haircut in our city (genuinely curious) and we chatted it up and clicked. I assumed he'd never text me but he did and said he enjoyed meeting me.

Since then, we agreed to meet after new year for coffee and he sends voice messages like ""Hey, I'd love to get coffee. It's so nice to hear from you and I hope you had a good new year"" and with a packed schedule, he's still made some space for us to meet. 

If this isn't flirting, then I really don't know what is. But while I could be blunt and ask what his intentions are, I could get a friend out of this and that would be equally great to experience. So we'll see what happens 😅",8,1736161840.0,gaybros,2,1.0,False

1 - My name is Sean.

B - I’m 40 years old 🎉

3 - I’m Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world.

4 - I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

E - It’s not unusual to find me lost in a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them. In turn, if you are looking for a suggestion, i'm here to help.

F - I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

7 - I like to go to the gym. I've seen a few people post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I’m never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

Super long post ahead!

Happy new year all!  I love seeing these kind of posts, so I decided to keep all my perfume empties from 2023-2024 and do a post on them :)

A lot of these empties were already being used before 2023, so they weren't all new! I did go a bit crazy buying full bottles after using up some of these samples, but it was a period of time when I was financially able to do so.

This year will be a bit different and I'm on a strict no-buy until I sell off/use quite a bit of my collection, which is sitting at about 130 full bottles. This amount is far too much for me, I plan to get it down to 72 bottles (which is still huge but fits perfectly on my perfume shelves without ovwhelming me) and then trim down what I can from there.

**FULL BOTTLE EMPTIES**

**Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry** \- rich cherry+raspberry with a soft woody drydown. Repurchased. **4/5**

**SDJ Cheirosa '62** \- warm, sweet and sugary but there's other scents I much prefer. **3/5**

**Carolina Herrera Good Girl Blush** \- zesty, playful floral, I love this for spring days. Repurchased. **5/5**

**Marc Jacobs Daisy Love Eau So Sweet** \- soft raspberries dusted with sugar, but the dry down is straight baby powder. **2/5**

**Kate Spade New York** \- juicy strawberries at a summer picnic, smells more like tart strawberry than sugary ones. **3/5**

**Guerlain Mon Guerlain EDP** \- comforting, grown up lavender+vanilla. I'll repurchase this before winter. **5/5**

**Marc Jacobs Daisy Paradise** \- ambroxan but make it floral. Nice but nothing special. **3/5**

**Ariana Grande Cloud Pink** \- fruitier version of Cloud, nice but I'm so over this scent DNA! **3/5**

**Marc Jacobs Perfect** \- juicy green scent, I like it a lot but wish it had better longevity. Repurchased. **3/5**

**Marc Jacobs Perfect Intense** \- prefer this one, it's a powdery, nutty almond milk scent. Repurchased. **5/5**

**JPG La Belle Le Parfum** \- thicker version of the OG, it's a sweet baked pear crumble. **4/5**

**Elie Saab Girl Of Now** \- warm pistachio baked-goods, I have other scents I much prefer now. **3/5**

**SAMPLES/TRAVEL SPRAYS**

**Navitus Soir Exclusif** \- cozy, soft, powdery scent, its slightly masculine. FB purchased. **4/5**

**Navitus Siesta Drive** \- nice lemon scent but pulled too masculine on my skin. **3/5**

**Givenchy L'ange Noir** \- elegant, nutty iris, this scent made me realise I love iris scents! FB purchased. **5/5**

\*\*Van Cleef & Arpels Orchidee Vanille"""" - verrrry soft vanilla, nice but far too soft. \*\*2/5"" \*\*

**Kayali Wedding Silk Santal** \- fruity, sweet scent with standard kayali DNA. I adore a lot of Kayali scents so no hate, this one is just nothing special! FB (stupidly) purchased. **3/5**

\*\**Kayali Wedding Velvet Santal*\*\* - FB came in a duo with Silk, nice lavender scent but too masculine. I'll sell this one. **2/5**

**Maison Mataha Escapade Gourmande**  \- literally smells like granulated sugar, I really wasn't a fan of this one. **2/5**

**Caroline Herrera Good Girl Blush Elixir** \- a darker, patchouli-based version of the OG Blush, I'll stick to the brighter Original version. **2/5**

**Kayali Vanilla 28** \- syrupy brown sugar scent, I'm already on my 2nd FB. **5/5**

**Ellis Brooklyn Bee** \- cacao dusted over thick honey, I love this one. FB purchased. **5/5**

**Ellis Brooklyn Salt** \- salty, beachy floral, it ends up smelling very animalic-sweaty-musky on me. **2/5**

**Cacharel Yes I Am Delicious** \- light ginger-chocolate scent, kind of smells like chocolate milk powder. **2/5**

1huwlgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1huwlgs/my_parents_recently_divorced/,My parents recently divorced ,"After 30 years of relationship, starting as friends, getting married,having 2 children and moving to a different continent alone and together, my parents divorced in 2024.

The divorce was ""friendly"", or at least more friendly than the last years of the relationship. 

My mom and Dad, both did so many mistakes through the years they were together and both of them ar at fault of their relationship not working out.

However, as an adult and person working on on her mental health, I can see how my mom did my dad wrong for sooo many years, to the point that one could even justify the reactive responses of my dad. He never abused my mom physically, but would get super mad for ""no reason"" all of the sudden with whomever was around, and when my mom would try to calm him down, he would react even worst.

So apparently after all these years of thinking that my dad was the problem, it turns out to be that my mom was emotionally and mentally abusing my dad. Making him feel like he was crazy, that he was useless and that he was the worst dad and husband ever, on top of isolating him by talking bullshit about other people, making him mad about said people and then when he was already upset she would try to make them think that my dad just had a strong character.

While my dad always had the mindset that a partner problem has to be solved with your psrtner leaving people on the side, so no one ever knew that the person creating the problems was my mom.

Since my mom is gone he looks less tired and more happy. He is taking care of himself again and his living conditions have improved.

However he wishes to have someone to spend life with, but he doesn't know how to start. He spent almos 30 years with the same woman and he doesn't know how to start a conversation: fr he is so scared of making women uncomfortable.

He doesn't want to change how he is, because he says he is too old for it:

He loves to work, to come back home and watch series and movies. He loves to cook and try new recipes. Eat healthy and from time to time do exercise.
Maybe cleaning is not his favorit thing to do, but he tries his best to do general cleaning of the house at least once a week.
He loves to read, play chess and spending time and sharing with his family. 
He loves his daughters (me and my sister) and even though he ""doesn't agree"" with same sex marriage, he loves my wife too and is happy for us.

He always says that he doesn't want to change, but he loves having conversations about politics, religion, the world, mental health etc. and he might not agree but also would end up saying something like ""whatever, you can believe whatever you want"", and hebis always open to hear new arguments and points of view.

He is not religious or too spiritual,  but he never forgets that there is something more than just these bodies walking around.

I would really love for my dad to find someone that loves him and cares for him, someone he can grow old with.

He knows that right now he needs space and time to improve himself, learn another language maybe and save all the money he could never save when he was with my mom.

But he is really romantic and sometimes prepares 2 cups of coffee in the morning, forgetting that now he is alone.

Since the initial separation which lasted only a few days of him being in NICU (albeit with me in a chair at his side 99% of the time) I've strived to follow attachment parenting to a tee and the idea of having someone not family or my husband looking after him has led me to feel like I've failed.

The gang runs into him at Mario’s (after Tony “wins” a fight when his opponent trips on the way into the ring and knocks himself out). Struggling to remind him who they are, they decide to get him a job at the Sunshine Garage. (Setting up an epic running gag, Latka arrives late after getting lost and ending up in Harlem, where he learns some new slang, with many amazing payoffs.)

Jim comes to the garage to join the fold and drops either a tranquilizer or a Chiclet into Louie’s coffee, resulting in Louie drifting off on an old song and harmonizing with Jim, ultimately agreeing to offer him a job, because “everybody works at Moonlight Bay”.

This episode has some of the best writing and most career-defining performances of the whole series, but it’s probably most remembered for Jim’s DMV test:

Jim: psst! What does a yellow light mean?

Bobby: “Slow down.”

Jim: Okay. What… does… a… yellow… light… mean?

It shapes the character of your interiors, defines spaces, and reflects your personality. With the right furniture, you can transform an ordinary house into a warm and inviting home. Let’s explore how to elevate your space with carefully chosen pieces, whether you’re designing an indoor sanctuary or creating an outdoor retreat.

# 1. Creating a Cohesive Style with the Right Furniture

Your furniture choices play a vital role in defining the overall aesthetic of your home. Whether you lean toward modern minimalism, rustic charm, or timeless elegance, selecting the right pieces ensures a harmonious flow throughout your space.

* [Home Style Furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/)**:** Opt for pieces that blend comfort and design. For a cohesive look, coordinate materials, finishes, and color palettes. For example, pairing a sleek glass coffee table with soft, upholstered seating can create a contemporary yet inviting vibe.

**Pro Tip:** Searching for [home furniture near me](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) is a great way to discover local stores offering unique and stylish furniture that complements your aesthetic.

# 2. The Role of Statement Furniture in Elevating Interiors

Statement furniture pieces—such as a bold sofa, an intricately carved dining table, or a striking armchair—can elevate your home by adding personality and sophistication. These pieces often serve as focal points, drawing the eye and setting the tone for the room.

* **How to Style Statement Furniture:** Balance bold pieces with subtle decor. For example, if you have a vibrant velvet sofa, neutral walls and understated accents can let it shine without overwhelming the space.

# 3. Functional Furniture for Outdoor Spaces

Your outdoor areas deserve just as much attention as your interiors. The right furniture can transform your garden, patio, or balcony into an extension of your home. Whether you’re hosting a summer barbecue or enjoying a quiet evening outdoors, functional and stylish outdoor furniture makes all the difference.

* **Explore Outdoor Furniture Stores:** Look for durable, weather-resistant materials like teak, rattan, or aluminum to ensure longevity. Many [garden furniture store](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) offer versatile options, from modular seating to foldable dining sets, perfect for creating an outdoor haven.

**Styling Tip:** Add cushions and throws in vibrant hues to make outdoor spaces feel cozy and inviting.

# 4. Multi-Functional Furniture for Small Spaces

For compact homes, furniture that serves multiple purposes is essential. Pieces like storage ottomans, extendable dining tables, or sofa beds maximize functionality without compromising on style.

* **Home Style Furniture for Small Spaces:** Opt for lighter finishes and slim profiles to avoid overwhelming smaller rooms. Mirrors and glass furniture can also make spaces appear larger and more open.

# 5. The Importance of Quality Over Quantity

Investing in high-quality furniture not only enhances aesthetics but also ensures durability and comfort. While trends come and go, timeless pieces are worth the investment, as they can be styled in various ways to suit changing tastes.

* **Finding the Best Deals:** Searching home furniture near me or visiting reputable [outdoor furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) and garden furniture stores can help you discover quality pieces that balance style and practicality.

**How to Choose Furniture for Each Space**

1. **Living Room:** Prioritize comfort and functionality with a mix of seating options, a coffee table, and accent pieces. Add personality with cushions, rugs, and art.
2. **Dining Room:** Choose a dining table and chairs that reflect your lifestyle. For smaller spaces, consider round tables or extendable designs.
3. **Bedroom:** Focus on a comfortable bed as the centerpiece, complemented by nightstands and storage solutions.
4. **Outdoor Spaces:** Create a seamless connection between indoors and outdoors with stylish furniture from local garden furniture stores. Look for pieces that enhance relaxation and socializing.

**Elevate Your Space Today**

Furniture is the foundation of any home’s aesthetic. From luxurious indoor furnishings to practical outdoor setups, the right choices can elevate your space and create an environment that feels uniquely yours. Whether you’re searching for home furniture near me, exploring outdoor furniture stores, or browsing a garden furniture store, remember to choose pieces that reflect your style and meet your needs.

It reminds me that no goal is too small 🤍

I’m still quite new to journaling, despite being eager to keep one my entire life. For years, I struggled with it and I always felt like my life was too boring, so why bother? I was terrible at planning, organising and thinking ahead. In January 2023, I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I finally started journaling last year. I want to share this to show that it’s never too late start.
I think small steps should be acknowledged and celebrated and I feel that's reflected in my goals this year.

I am currently in a relationship for a year, it's been a roller coaster but we were able to make it through for a year, we don't live together because we both have our own apartments, but we manage to set up our time so we can still sleep together everynight. My child lives with me every other week prior to ""50/50"" garde partager with my ex husband who doesn't live far. So my boyfriend comes home to my apartment when I have my child with me, and I sleep over to his whenever I am free. 

I have abandonment issues and sadly, anxious attachment style. I precisely told my boyfriend about that matter, and he knows, It was bold of me, despite my introverted nature to ask him not to let me sleep alone or without him. And this is the case today. We don't live that far from each other but he is about to do piquet at work (working at 3-4am on call) and since the voirie where he is stationed is closer to his home, for the first time in our entire relationship, he wants to sleep alone in his place for a couple of  months while I am here on my own. I am not used to it and frankly gives me anxiety. It hurts me, I know it would be a big convenience to him, but we live in the same city, from my home, it will take him 20 minutes walk to his work station, I told him that I am willing to wake up early with him, make his coffee etc, but he's not so eager. By the way, we only get to be with each other at morning and evening because he goes home from work and spends his time gaming til night and then he comes over. Am I selfish? It will break me if we eventually do this. How can I cope? ",1,1736159469.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False
1huw3fs,https://i.redd.it/ldnf5l2epcbe1.jpeg,New portafilter or new machine? [€300],"New Portafilter or New Machine?

Hi all, 
As I’m getting more confident about espresso making I can’t help but feel that my parents’ Illy 1935 Anniversary espresso machine, while aesthetically appealing, doesn’t make the best coffee.

Flow rate, temperature and ratio seem to be ok, but the portafilter has these plasticky bits that I can’t remove and are hard to clean, I’m wondering if that is the problem.

I’ve been looking on here for a mention of the portafilter size because I think it’s non standard, but haven’t gotten around to measuring it yet because I don’t know how. Do you account for the width of the metal or just the diameter? 

My parents mostly use those paper capsules from Illy and pressurised baskets (yuck) whereas I have a little hand grinder with me and dose my shots, and that usually makes for decent coffee. However when I’m at their place I miss my Bambino, I’m wondering if instead of buying a portafilter I should just get them a better machine, something like the Barista Express would look good and be easy enough to use, though the little illy has some things going for it.

If you recall u/adamobrien03 [post about organizing start-up/business meet-ups in Cork](https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/17qx2cz/cork_startup_group/), we've partnered up. The monthly meet-ups now include a morning coffee session and an evening pub gathering.

Looking ahead to 2025 we plan to launch a monthly Show & Tell event. These sessions will feature 2-3 individuals (or accountable partners/groups) sharing their journeys, followed by a Q&A (not AMA). We aim to create a space for thoughtful reflection and meaningful discussions about personal and professional growth.

A little backstory: We started as two individuals working on separate projects, but we found value in holding each other accountable. This partnership kept us focused and motivated, and it has helped us stay on track and continue our journeys without giving up. And we think that helping people find their accountable counterparts and showing projects on Show&Tell will keep them motivated.
