**Section Three: Income**

Main Job Monthly Take Home: \~$7,000 after health insurance, retirement, taxes. This year I also received a 10% bonus after we reached a milestone. My spouse isn‚Äôt currently working and is a stay-at-home cat dad.

**Section Four: Travel Expenses**

Alright, to be honest, the last few years have been shit for me (emotionally) and so I didn‚Äôt police my spending whatsoever. My husband and I decided last year to stop fertility treatments and live that child free life. It was difficult to make that decision, but I do think it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for us in the here and now. So, 2024 has been more of ‚Äúfuck it, what else am I spending my money on?!‚Äù.

I decided I wanted to travel more, with or without my spouse. My spouse doesn‚Äôt love traveling, and we spend a lot of my vacation days already flying to visit his family out of state so when my mom asked if I would be interested in going on a trip with her, my spouse encouraged me to say yes and go with her.

When my mom asked where I wanted to go, my answer was immediately France. I absolutely love France ‚Äì this would be my 4^(th) visit, and my 3^(rd) with my mom. I speak some French and wanted desperately to go back. I would have been relatively happy with only Paris, but my mom wanted to see other parts of France as well. We  decided to do southern France this time around. I started planning it myself, but my mom seemed interested in doing a tour. I told her I‚Äôd only do a tour that had 3 hotels maximum and gave her a timeline of how long I could be away from work. She found one that went to Avignon and Nice and started in Paris. We planned to come in early, spend 5-6 days in Paris area ahead of time, and then join the group at the start of the tour to move on to the south of France.

As I go through, I‚Äôll note the full cost of things, and if I‚Äôm splitting the cost with my mom highlight that. I kept a shared google doc with my mom to track costs. Before we left, I got about $500 in euros (‚Ç¨450) - it was absolutely too much cash. My mom wanted about $400 worth and I wanted about $100 worth, and at the end of the trip I had to make sure we were paying for everything in cash so I wouldn‚Äôt be left with a significant amount of cash. I ended up with ‚Ç¨6 at the end so I call it good.

**Transportation**:

Flight: SFO-> Charles De Gaulle, and return was Nice-> SFO with a layover in Frankfurt. **Total cost: $1443.59**

**Accommodations**:

Only had to book 1 hotel, as the rest were organized and paid for through the tour company.

Paris Hotel, 4 nights: $1494 (half: **$747**)

**Pre-Vacation Spending**

Tour: 6 nights, three cities, including 1 optional add on tour: $4797 (Half: **$2397**)

Pre-Bookings:

Day trip to Champagne, plus train tickets: $845 (**half: $437.50**)

Caves du Louvre Wine Tasting, plus corkscrew souvenir: $108 (**half: $54**)

Catacombs tickets (must book in advance, but only 1 week in advance is allowed): $65 (half: **$32.50**)

New suitcase: My old suitcase works just fine but tends to allow me to get really close to the 50lb/23kg mark without even trying. I got a new ‚ÄúMedium Checked Bag‚Äù ($**94.99),** that was perfect. Fully packed on the way there my bag was 35lbs.

I also bought some odds and ends:

* Bluetooth transmitter/receiver, so I could watch movies on the screens on the airplanes **($22.99).** 
* Sling purse **($25.19)** and wallet **($20.88):** I don‚Äôt carry a purse or wallet in my day to day, so I decided to get one as my ‚Äúday bag‚Äù for the trip and a wallet that can carry all the euro coins. ¬†
* Chipolo one point key finder **($27.99**): I had seen some people online talk about using something like this to track their luggage. I bought one to try out and keep in my checked luggage. Probably wouldn‚Äôt buy it again as it wasn‚Äôt very useful. It needs access to the Google Find my Phone network, and I don‚Äôt think phones are allowed in many places in the airport workers areas, so it wasn‚Äôt very up to date. It probably would have worked great if my luggage was stuck at a layover, as I when I landed back in the states it was saying my luggage was last seen 10 hrs ago at my layover stop (but it was on my flight and I got it as I got off the plane).

**Section Five**: **Travel Diary**

**Day 1:**

Time to go to Paris! I was awake around 5 am to try and beat jetlag on the other end (spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt work for me because I can‚Äôt fall asleep on airplanes even with 2 sleeping pills), so I was awake around 5 am. Day started with one of my cats rolling around on top of me for pets while in bed, which I happily obliged. I think both cats were excited that someone was awake at 5 with them.

Got up, made some coffee and eggs, and sat down to finish reading my book. Our flight wasn‚Äôt until 4 pm, and I wanted to try and finish this book because I wasn‚Äôt going to bring a physical book with me, only my kindle. I already downloaded a bunch of books from the library for the trip. Managed to finish my book around 8 am, I made some lunch for myself, half of which I packed into a to go container to bring on my flight with me (solid choice, the food on the flight was very meh).

My parents live about 45 minutes away from us, and we‚Äôre on the way to the airport so my dad agreed to drive us to the airport. Dad picked me up around 11 am and we got to SFO 3 hours before our flight. We got some lunch at a restaurant **($30.25** with tip), and then went to a newsstand to get some snacks and a bottle of water ($**17.02**). We boarded our flight, and at the last minute, my mom saw that there was an empty aisle seat across from me, so she asked to be switched, so I had an empty seat next to me the whole flight which was awesome. Dozed some, watched some movies, ate some food, time traveled.

**Day total: $47.27**

**Day 2:**

Land at CDG around 10 am local time. By the time we get through immigration, customs, and get our bags, it was around 11am. I was fine with taking the train into the city, but my mom wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that, so we got a cab. Taxis from the airport have a set price into the city ($75 with small tip, half: **$37.50**), ‚Ç¨56 for Right Bank and ‚Ç¨64 for Left Bank. I gave our taxi driver the address (in French! I was very excited) and headed to our hotel. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready, so we stored our luggage at the hotel and walked to the Luxembourg Gardens, which were a few blocks away. We admired the Medici Fountain, walked through the gardens, and proceeded to get lost in the St-Germain-De-Pres area. We stopped for lunch, and the place was great. We had 2 glasses of wine each, some lunch, and by the time we were done our room was ready. Mom paid for lunch, and we headed back to the hotel. By the time I got in the room, the lack of sleep and the 2 Kir Royals were catching up to me. I promptly fell asleep for a nap and woke up around 6 pm feeling so much better. We both decided we didn‚Äôt care about dinner; I had a snack and fell back asleep around 9.

Step total: 6012

**Day Total: $37.50**

**Day 3:**

First full day! We got breakfast at the hotel (I love European breakfast. Give me all the rolls, cheese, and Nutella I can stuff in my mouth) and I fully caffeinated myself. I had picked our hotel because it was centrally located to what we wanted to do, and as such the first place we went to was only a few blocks away. Our first stop was to the Cluny Museum (Museum of the Middle Ages) ‚Äì mom paid the entrance fee.

There is a book called ‚ÄúThe Lady and the Unicorn‚Äù by Tracy Chevalier that my mom and I both read probably 20 years ago, which is about these 6 tapestries from the middle ages depicting a Lady and a Unicorn, with each tapestry representing one of the 5 senses, with the 6^(th) showing all. This book is historical fiction about the creation of the real tapestries, and ever since we read that book we‚Äôve wanted to see these tapestries which are at the Cluny Museum in Paris. I saw them when I was in Paris in 2008, but my mom never had. We made a beeline for the tapestries and spent at least 20 minutes sitting there reading about them and just soaking them in. After seeing most of the rest of the museum, I needed a break, so we went to the ‚ÄúCaf√© des Amis‚Äù at the museum (Friends of the museum caf√©), where I got a latte, and mom got a lemonade **($5.75**). We walked through the gift shop, and I picked up a needlepoint kit where you make a bookmark with the pattern from one of the tapestries, and a magnet **($18.74).**

We had about 2 hours until our next planned item, so we walked back to the hotel. On the way, we stopped at a Gibert Joseph (bookstore) to look for a book my husband had asked for. I picked up a French language version of Slaughterhouse 5 (Abbatoir 5) for him **($7.08**), and next door was a Monoprix (kind of like a city Target ‚Äì has groceries, household items, and maybe some clothing) to get Mom her Coke Zero. She bought some coke zero and snacks, and I picked up some snacks, an Oatly coffee drink, and an Oasis juice (I was obsessed with Oasis when I lived there in 2008) **($11.14**). My favorite thing in a foreign place is to go to the grocery store and buy snacks and drinks that you can‚Äôt find in the US.

After stopping at the hotel, our next ‚Äòevent‚Äô was across the river, but it was either a 20-minute walk or 20-minute combo of walking and the metro, so we decided to walk. It was probably the only sunny day of our time in Paris, and it was GORGEOUS. All the French people knew it too, they were out in droves.

Stop #2 of the day was at the Caves Du Louvre. Mom and I LOVE wine tasting, and I had found out you could wine taste in the Louvre Caves where the kings of France had kept wine. While tasting, we learned that it was the renovated caves for the family who had originally provided wine for Louis XIV. Mostly, the tour walked us through what the different wine regions of France are, how to read the label to see what kind of wine you are getting, and wine culture in France. We loved it! And the wine was excellent. Mom bought a bottle of wine that we had tasted, with the intention that we would drink it while on our trip (spoiler alert we did not ‚Äì it‚Äôs ok I thought this might happen and had packed a wine sleeve just in case).

We walked back to the hotel, and on the way went into a random brasserie and each had a glass of wine and dinner. I had chicken thigh and French fries, and my mom had a croque monsieur (grilled ham and cheese sandwich). Mom paid, saying she‚Äôd have me pay her half after the trip (another spoiler, of course she didn‚Äôt, I had to fight her to pay for some meals).

Step total: 9,350

**Day Total: $42.71**

**Day 4:**

Got up, once again had our European breakfast (loving it). Took the metro **($2.37**) to the Museum of Liberation of Paris today **(Free**) and honestly this museum is one of the best free museums I‚Äôve ever been to. The whole museum is about the occupation of Paris during WWII, and its subsequent liberation from the Nazis. It was excellent and did an amazing job walking through the timeline. Loved it, highly recommend it.

It‚Äôs also conveniently across the street from the Catacombs. I hadn‚Äôt done these when I was in Paris previously and was excited to do them. My mom is 71 and kept up with me no problem while walking but I didn‚Äôt realize she has a hard time with stairs, and if I had I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone to the Catacombs. You must walk down 200+ steps and then back up 200+ steps. I literally texted my sibling group chat that night saying ‚ÄúI think I killed mom‚Äù in regards to the stairs. She was a trooper and made it through!

We had timed tickets to the Catacombs and a little bit of time to waste beforehand. I got a Pain au Chocolate (Chocolate croissant) at a bakery **($1.50)** and my mom was impressed that I had the whole conversation in French. I was also excited that I could have these small conversations and not have people revert to English for me.

We went into the Catacombs (prepaid, $32.50 each) and started down the winding steps. The Catacombs in Paris are unique in that they weren‚Äôt started as a religious burial ground or hiding place like those in Rome; these were created by limestone quarries which then had to be filled in, and during the 18-19^(th) centuries the citizens of Paris wanted to move cemeteries out of the then-city limits. Very creepy, very cool, highly recommend but know there‚Äôs a lot of steps.

After we climbed up the stairs to the exit, we puttered around the gift shop (we love us a museum gift shop), we each bought a magnet (**$4.36**). We walked around the corner to a Franprix (small grocery store), where we got my mom a soda, and me some water and an Oasis ‚Äì mom paid. We were about a 20-minute walk from where I lived when I was a student in Paris, so we walked through a lovely neighborhood for about 20 minutes, and then through Parc Monsouris (Laughing Mouse Park) to get to Cit√© Universitaire, where I had lived. It‚Äôs a set of \~40 ‚Äúhouses‚Äù in the 14^(th) where students can live; some of the houses are attached to specific countries but¬† that doesn‚Äôt mean only students from those countries live there (for instance, I lived in the ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù house, but none of the staff were American, and there were students from all over the world living there). It was fun to be able to point out my room and see it hadn‚Äôt changed much on the outside at least. I texted pictures to a couple of the people I met on that study abroad trip that I still maintain contact with and reminisced some about that t ime!

We both bought 2 metro tickets **($4.75**) ¬†to use over the next few days. We got on the tram stop right outside the building. We transferred to the Metro at Place d‚ÄôItalie, and had a ‚Äòfun‚Äô experience getting through the turnstiles. First one ate one of my mom‚Äôs metro ticket because my mom didn‚Äôt go through fast enough (a little her fault, she kept waiting for it to tell her something and then she futzed with her bag too long before trying to go though). So, she bought another ticket, and I pushed her through the turnstile as soon as it pinged ok. I went next, and as I was going through the turnstile decided to not turn fully, so I was half in half out. Everyone around us was having an issue too so it wasn‚Äôt us! I wiggled through and was fine and felt ok since my ticket had at least been validated. Fun times on the Paris metro.

The whole point to this endeavor was because I wanted to go to a yarn store I found online (Une Maille a l‚ÄôEndroit). We took the metro a few stops, got off near the store, and I browsed while my mom sat and looked through catalogues. The person manning the till was very nice and spoke great English, which worked out well since my French doesn‚Äôt extend to my hobbies apparently. I bought three balls of fingering weight wool made in France **($27.99**) with the intention of knitting up a hat or some socks for me and my mom to commemorate this trip.

We walked about 25 minutes back to our hotel, and then got dinner at the pub next door to our hotel. My mom had 2 Aperol Spritzes and said they were the best she‚Äôs ever had (and maintained that through the whole trip), plus a hamburger. I had 2 beers and a chicken sandwich and it was a good meal to end the day. Mom paid for dinner (she recently learned how to use Apple Wallet and is now a force to be reckoned with when it comes to whipping out credit cards to pay).

**Day Total: $40.97**

**Day 5:**

Champagne day!

One thing my mom insisted upon when coming on this trip was that she wanted to go to Champagne, and she wanted to visit Veuve Clicquot. Veuve was the first Champagne house to be managed by a woman (officially), and she was allowed to because she was a widow (Veuve = widow). There are others from the time (late 18^(th) century) that were also managed by a woman, but she was the ‚Äòfirst‚Äô.

We chose to do a tour through France Intense. We found them on GetYourGuide, but I booked through their website as it was cheaper to do it through them. We prebooked the tour and our train tickets. We specifically chose them because they guaranteed we would go to Veuve Clicquot -there were a couple of slightly cheaper tours but they only said it was an option and may not happen.

We got up before the sun to catch our train to Reims. We took the metro to Gare de l‚ÄôEst, where we took the train to Reims (took about 45 minutes). There, we met our guide and the others on the tour with us (6 of us plus the guide). First stop was at Veuve Clicquot, where we went on a guided tour of the caves and had 4 tastings (more like full glasses ‚Äì it was a lot of champagne for 10AM). The tour was excellent and the guide at Veuve was very knowledgeable. After a gander through the gift shop, where I bought a tea towel and champagne stopper **($44.17**) and my mom bought an apron and a champagne stopper, we were on our way to the next stop. Our tour guide took us around the Notre Dame de Reims, which is where all the French kings were anointed. He then drove us to a small local restaurant for lunch (included in the tour) which of course, started with champagne. Afterwards, we were driven through the valley to a family-owned domain called Champagne Cordoin Didierlaurent. There, we were shown around their vineyards, the caves, and finally to taste. About an hour later we were dropped back off in Reims to await our train back to Paris. We gave a tip to our guide (‚Ç¨10**, my half $5.43**) and walked around the small downtown square area. We went into a bar to get a bathroom and a coke zero for mom and a beer for me and to waste the 2 hours we had before the train **($7.61).**

It was finally time to get our train back to Paris ‚Äì basically reversing our trip of the morning, we took the train into Gare de l‚ÄôEst, took the metro back to the area of our hotel and walked another 5 minutes from the station to our hotel. As we walked back, I was getting hungry but was in no mood for a sit-down dinner (it was around 9 pm). So, we wandered over to the familiar golden arches of McDonalds a block from our hotel (or, Macdo as the French call it) and ordered some food, made even easier by¬† the fact everything is a touch screen ordering system. I felt no shame and was very excited to see the differences between US and French McDonalds. You can get potato wedges instead of fries in France! Mom paid, and we ate it back in our hotel room, while my mom told me the Coke Zero from McDonalds isn‚Äôt as good as the stuff in the bottle.

After I came home I went to McDonalds one day and told my husband ‚ÄúFrench McDonalds is better‚Äù .

**Day 6**:

Today is the day our Guided tour starts! We had to be at our new hotel by 5 pm for a welcome drink and then dinner, but otherwise the day is ours.

We got going for the day, having our final breakfast in this hotel, packing our bags, and taking a cab to our new hotel in Le Marais (right side of the Seine) (**$8.15**). After dropping our bags, we walked about 20 minutes to get to the Pompidou where the modern art museum is. I had a Nutella crepe at a stand¬† **($4.89**) outside, and then my mom bought tickets to the main exhibit. I had been to the Pompidou once before, but in the interim I‚Äôve gained more appreciation for modern art and really enjoyed myself. The building itself is a fun work of art, where the pipes and the escalators etc are all on the outside of the building. I used to walk by the building almost every day when I was a student, because my study abroad office was only a few blocks away from it. The top floors of the museum have an excellent view of the main sights of the city.

After the Pompidou, I was ON A MISSION. I love the Olympics, and so I was on a mission to find some Olympics paraphernalia. I had a list from the official website of where some stores still were (jk they weren‚Äôt there but we didn‚Äôt know this yet!), so we walked by Hotel de Ville (town hall) where some signage was up but there was no store. There was another by the Louvre (***apparently***), which was a 20-minute walk further away from our hotel. My mom said she was up for it, so we went walking that way. We went by the Louvre, saw the Pyramid, and then wandered around the square that the store was supposed to be in to no avail. It was also starting to heavily pour in this time, so we asked around, but no one knew what we were talking about. We walked into a Franprix to get my mom some soda and then caught a cab back to our hotel (**my half - $4.50**).

We checked in with our tour guide, met the rest of the people on the tour (I was the youngest by at least 5 years, and there was probably only 4 of us under 50 on this tour), and then went for dinner (included in tour price) in the Latin Quarter.

**Day 7:**

Last day in Paris!

Day started with breakfast at the hotel, and this one had a much larger spread than the previous one. I had my usual coffee/bread/cheese, but also they put out cucumber and quinoa and tomatoes and I loved it.

The first order of the day was to go on a bus tour of sights in Paris. My mom and I originally had thought we might skip this, but we decided to go and I‚Äôm glad we did. We‚Äôve been to all these sights before, but we hadn‚Äôt seen any on this trip yet, and can you really say you‚Äôve been to Paris if you haven‚Äôt taken a picture in front of the Eiffel Tower? We were bussed around to see the Eiffel Tower, Pantheon, Louvre, Musee D‚ÄôOrsay, Pont Neuf, Les Invalides, and the Arc de Triomphe. We got out at the Eiffel Tower to take pictures, and then out at Les Invalides to take pictures and have a bathroom stop at a cafe (**$4.89** for a hot chocolate and a croissant so my mom could use the bathroom). We were let out at the Arc de Triomphe, and about half the group was going on to Versailles for an optional tour, but both my mom and I have been multiple times, so we skipped it. I tipped the local guide who gave us information on the bus tour (2 euros**, $2.17**), asked him if he knew anything about the Olympics stores (he didn‚Äôt), and we wandered around the Arc.

We didn‚Äôt want to go to the top of the Arc, so we walked around it and then started down the Champs Elysees. AND GUESS WHAT. Almost immediately we find a kiosk who has some Olympics stuff. I figured out later that a lot of the little kiosk sellers on the Champs Elysees have these items, and I could have saved about $10 by going further down, but I didn‚Äôt know that then and I was so happy to have found a place selling items. I end up buying a Phyrge (the mascot) and a Paris 2024 bag with the Olympics emblem (**$85.15**). We continued walking down the Champs Elysees and wandered into some more shops. I also bought a luggage tag with the Olympics swimming emblem on it **($14.17**) and my mom bought a magnet.

We buy one more metro ticket each **($2.36**) at the bottom of the Champs Elysees. There is a kitchen store that my mom really wants to go to called E.Dehillerin. Apparently it is THE kitchen store to go to for chefs, and Julia Child used to go there when she lived in Paris. My mom shops around and I encourage her to take her time, especially since I dragged her everywhere to find these Olympics things. My mom got a tote bag, a measuring cup, and a couple of bench/bowl scrapers with the logo on it, and I get some food tweezers and a bowl scraper **($10.81**). At this point, I‚Äôm getting hungry, so we go to a brasserie/caf√© across the street from the store. My mom literally only has a glass of Prosecco (lunch of champions apparently), and I have a sandwich and Kir Royal **($42.30**).

Notre Dame still isn‚Äôt open after the fire in 2019 (scheduled for Christmas services this December), but you can go sit outside of it and see the work they‚Äôve done. We walked to Notre Dame and checked out the work done and the pictures they have of the cleanup effort. ¬†We wandered into souvenir shops nearby and my mom ¬†buys a gargoyle magnet to replace one I bought her years ago, and I bought myself some ice cream from Amorino. It‚Äôs a chain that is all over now, but when I was a student it was cheap-ish place to get gelato when it was fucking hot out **($4.61**).

We walk back to the hotel, and on the way stop at the Place de la Bastille, and what do we find there but the Olympics rings and Paralympics Agitos! I was, again, SO EXCITED and took many photos. We stopped at a grocery store to get lunch for the next day (mom paid), and then I picked up some dinner for us (**$16.92**), and went back to our hotel to pack up to go to the south of France!

**Day 8:**

Let me tell you, taking a train with 32 Americans who have little to zero experience on public transit is one of the circles of hell.

Our next stop on the guided tour is Avignon ‚Äì¬† where the French popes lived in the 14^(th) century. We took the TGV train (high speed train) from Paris to Avignon, which only took about 2.5 hours versus 8+ hours on the bus. I‚Äôve always loved train travel in Europe and taking it makes me happy. We ate lunch on the train that we got from the store the night before, and as the train starts to slow down into Avignon my mom and I gather our stuff and we‚Äôre ready! Even with warning everyone, a solid amount of people seemed surprised that they must quickly get off the train; I could see our tour guide visibly anxious about this. Once we‚Äôre all off (and 1 person left a bag that our guide found before he left the train car), we get on our charter bus that takes us to the walled city of Avignon.

We get a guided tour of the Palace of the Popes, and I give our local guide a euro tip at the end **($1.09**). We then have a few hours to ourselves before moving on to the next thing. My mom and I wander around Avignon until we get to the edge of the walled city. As we walk back through the ‚Äúold town‚Äù, we stop in a fancy food shop, where my mom gets some anise cookies and olive oil, and I pick up some candy **($17.10**). We go to a souvenir shop where the salesperson there is hardcore trying to get us to buy SOMETHING lavender. I get some soaps and a magnet **($11.00**). In Avignon there is a bridge that crosses the Rhone River that is partially collapsed (Pont St Benezet). I saw it as we drove in and really wanted to go, but my mom didn‚Äôt. So, I left her in the square that was the tour group meeting point and I went up and down some stairs to see this bridge **($6.05**). I wandered around for a bit and then made my way back to where my mom was, who then told me all about how she managed to find the public bathrooms and make her way back without getting lost. I act like my mom is infirm or something, but she is a very capable person. I had just been the one ‚Äòin charge‚Äô of us for the last week or so, and I worried about leaving her to get lost in a foreign country.

After getting back on the bus, we are driven to a local family winery. We‚Äôre from a wine area in California, and as we drive around my mom excitedly says, ‚Äúit looks just like home!‚Äù, which it did. We had a tasting at this winery (pretty good wines, I liked them all). My mom buys a bottle of wine and a wine glass that says the name of the winery as I translate to the pourer that my mom is also a pourer at a winery, but in California.

We finally get to our hotel in Nimes around 7, and the tour group has dinner at the hotel restaurant, which apparently has a Michelin Star. We were given a set menu ‚Äì the food was very good, and when the woman across from me starts discussing the components of the dish I was very excited. When I go out with my husband we critique and breakdown all of our food, but my mom definitely doesn‚Äôt care and I had been missing that. The food was some of the best of the trip, and it was all delicious. ¬†

**Day 9:**

Up early again. This hotel has oat milk for coffee at breakfast!

The first thing we do is go to Pont du Gard, which is a Roman Aqueduct. I had learned about this in an architectural history class in college and was very excited to see it in person. Since we were there so early, we were some of the only people at the aqueduct and it was so lovely out. Our tour guide is taking people up to a viewing point, but I hate hiking, and my mom doesn‚Äôt want to do the steps, so we instead stay down at the aqueduct level. We are walking on the dirt and stones to get to the river when I start a slow descent into the mud (my last clean pair of jeans too), knees first. Mom being a mom, she whips out baby wipes from her Mary Poppins purse and helps me clean up, and I am finally able to get to the river and wash my jeans off. We visited the gift shop but skipped out on the museum. I bought a magnet and a bookmark (**$6.37**) and I think my mom got a magnet.

The tour then takes us to Arles, which is where Van Gogh spent a lot of time and where he painted ‚ÄúStarry Night Over the Rhone‚Äù (why yes, there are 2 starry night paintings, and no, I didn‚Äôt know that previously). We saw some Rhone River cruises and my mom started talking about how we should do that next trip. We have a walking tour of the city, and then have lunch at a caf√© where they immediately ask us if we want French or English menus. The Italian influence is obviously stronger in the south, and you can get things like pasta with pesto here. I pay (yay!) and give our waiter a ‚Ç¨2 tip because he was truly great **($49.34)**. I‚Äôm starting to realize we have too much cash and I‚Äôm trying to pay for everything in cash as we go along; my mom doesn‚Äôt understand why I keep trying to do so.

After Arles, we are taken to St Remy de Provence, where Van Gogh was a patient at the St Paul Asylum (the town of St Remy is the town in the Starry Night painting that everyone knows). It was interesting to see the asylum, but I wish we had more time, which is a common feeling I have when on this tour. ¬†Before heading back, we went to the gift shop, and I get a little pencil pouch with the sunflowers on them (**$7.92**)¬†

We got back to Nimes, and I wanted to see the Temple of Diana and the water fountains that are in the park near our hotel, but we don‚Äôt end up getting out until after the parks are closed. My mom wants to get some more soda, but as we leave the hotel we see one of the other members of the tour group who tells us all the grocery stores close at 7 in town. I check on google, find one open a few blocks from us, and decide to walk and see if google is correct (it is!). We get some snacks, some food for lunch tomorrow, and of course some Coke Zero (mom pays). My mom got very excited because she saw a bottle of wine from a winery in our town at this grocery store.

We sit in the hotel bar and have a drink each¬† ($**18.49)** and hang out with some of the people on our tour. Mom has an Aperol Spritz, and I have a very delicious cocktail with raspberries and gin in it so I‚Äôm a happy camper. I chat about cocktails and cocktails making with some of the people we‚Äôre drinking with (it was a pandemic hobby for me).

Step Total: 14,147

**Day total: $82.12**

**Day 10:**

Today we‚Äôre heading to Nice! It‚Äôs about a 3-hour bus ride to Nice, and we stop at a truck stop along the way. Mom and I had bought some food the night before, but there was also food available for purchase.

On the way, we stopped in Cannes for pictures at the theater where the film festival takes place. We then go to Grasse to the Fragonard perfume factory and get a tour. Honestly, looks like every other manufacturing floor I‚Äôve been on, but I also know I‚Äôve been on more than most. I perused some soaps to purchase, but nothing caught my fancy, so I left without buying anything.

Finally, we got to Nice! We drive along the Boulevard des Anglaises on the way to the hotel. One of the optional events was to go into Monaco and to the Monte Carlo casino this evening ‚Äì we chose not to as my mom doesn‚Äôt gamble, and I don‚Äôt care enough to pay money to go. We instead walked around Nice for the evening. We find a pop-up museum event where they are describing the WWII Liberation of the city of Nice (we have a type of thing we like to do lol) ‚Äì all the signs are in French, so my mom listens as I translate, or use google translate for the words I can‚Äôt figure out. We walk through the Old Town and along the promenade, and I get a scoop of ice cream for ‚Äúdinner‚Äù (**$4.60**).

We started walking back to our hotel, and stop at grocery store #6 (a franprix) to get what else? Coke zero. Plus, some chips! We intended to go to the store the next day to get some snacks (my husband‚Äôs favorite souvenir when I travel) and were told there is a hypermarche near our hotel, so I held off buying any souvenir snacks. When we get back to the hotel, we go to the rooftop bar to have some drinks **($30.45**). Mom has another Aperol Spritz, and concludes the one made at the pub in Paris was the best of the trip.

**Day 11:**

You can‚Äôt go to Nice without going to Monaco so today that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing! It‚Äôs our last day in France, I‚Äôm ready to head home, and I am on my final clean shirt.

After breakfast we walked about 10 minutes to the train station, passing the Carrefour hypermarche on the way there. Mom buys 2 round trip tickets to Monaco. Once we‚Äôre there, I manage to get confused about the exits and lead us entirely in the wrong direction, making my mom walk up about 50 steps. We then have a 25 minutes‚Äô walk to the ‚ÄúRock‚Äù area, where the Prince‚Äôs Palace is located. Let me tell you, Monaco is on a fucking cliff face, there‚Äôs nothing flat anywhere. We walk down this hill, and then immediately must walk up long steps to get to the top of the Rock. This day in Monaco is all for mom, she really wanted to see this, so I made sure to make it happen. There were some wrong turns but we made it though. Mom didn‚Äôt want to go into the Palace, so we walked around outside and then mom found the (drumroll please) GIFT SHOP! She‚Äôs so happy. She walks around for ages and gets a shot glass, a wine tumbler, a t-shirt, , and a magnet (also a coke zero). I don‚Äôt want anything but I‚Äôm happy to carry around the stuff as she shops. After leaving, we sit and watch the view for a while from a bench and it is truly gorgeous. No wonder it‚Äôs so expensive here.

We walked around the little square, I bought some gelato (**$5.98**), and we walked around a garden and saw the Princess Grace statue. We continued to marvel at the beautiful views of the Mediterranean as we wandered around. We start to walk back down the stairs and tried to get a taxi but none were coming by, so we commit ourselves to walking all the way back up to the train station‚Ä¶..which is when I figured out that I definitely brought us out of the wrong station exit and we walked up too many stairs. I find the lower entrance, bought a can of Oasis **($2.76**), and we waited for our train back to Nice.

After returning to Nice, we went into the Carrefour Hypermarche (seriously, this thing was larger that some US Walmarts). I spent a good 30 minutes walking up and down aisles, grabbing fun snacks for my husband and for friends **($32.33**). My mom again tries to pay with her Apple pay and I had to stop her so I can use our cash.

We had dinner with the tour group ‚Äì the people we sat with were fun and were the people we enjoyed hanging out with for most of the tour, but the food was very meh. One issue I had with the tour was that it wasn‚Äôt always obvious when we got the set menu what had red meat or not, as I try to avoid red meat. Apparently, Ravioli Ni√ßoise has ground beef in it.

After this, we head back to the hotel and finish packing!

Step Total: 13,881  
**Day Total: $41.07**

**Day 12:**

Going Home! I am very sad to leave France, but also happy to see my husband and cats again. We are awake at 4 am to get to the airport. We prearranged a taxi to the airport, and because it was so early it was ‚Ç¨50 for the 15-minute trip (my half - **$27.16**). We check in and try to get the airline employee to get us seats next to each other on our flights. They say there is nothing they can do so we just deal with it. Our first flight is Nice to Frankfurt, and then Frankfurt to SFO.

Pret a Manger finally opens around 5 am, so I get an iced coffee and a croissant ‚Äì the worker IMMEDIATELY changes to English when I order the iced coffee in French, which I found hilarious **($7.27**). Our flight boards around 6 am, and the first flight is relatively painless and I‚Äôm asleep quickly. It‚Äôs a short flight, and we land in Frankfurt around 8 am. We have a 2-hour layover in Frankfurt, and most of it is spent with us getting snacks **($4.65**), going through immigration, and hitting up the bathroom more than once.

Our flight is delayed by about an hour because they only have one jet bridge for boarding. I have a window seat and it‚Äôs one of the worst flights I‚Äôve been on. The couple next to me doesn‚Äôt speak any English (not that I expected them to), but it makes asking to get out to go to the bathroom and walk around that much harder and I‚Äôm primed to not be a bother. Every time I get up, they just stand there and wait for me to get back so I don‚Äôt feel like I can just wander around. Food is much better on this flight than our one to France, and finally 12 hours later we‚Äôre coming back into SFO! It‚Äôs fleet week, so our flight is slightly diverted but it affords me a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge as we fly in.

My husband picks us up at the airport - I am very excited to see my cats, and I don‚Äôt think they cared that I left or that I was back. My husband loves the snacks and gifts I bought him (the book and the food tweezers). He‚Äôs used the food tweezers so much since I gave them to him that he says they are the best souvenir I‚Äôve ever brought back.

**Day Total: $39.08**

**Final thoughts:**

I loved going to France, and I loved going to France with my mom. Some of the things on the tour I didn‚Äôt care about ‚Äì for instance, I wouldn‚Äôt have gone out of my way to go to a perfume factory or to where the Cannes film festival occurs. However, the flip side to that is that I wouldn‚Äôt have gone out of my way to see Arles or St Remy, which I did really enjoy. I think if I did another tour it would spend more time looking at tours and what they focus on ‚Äì I‚Äôd love one that really went into the local foods and wines, for example. Another part I did enjoy was having a little bit of break of being the one ‚Äúin charge‚Äù, making sure we were getting where we needed to be.

This trip cemented that one of my favorite things to do on a trip is to wander around, see local sights, and just take it all in. Looking back on previous trips, what I remember most is usually my neighborhood wanderings during the day and hanging out in bars in the evenings. Also, I still love France, I love Paris, and I will go back any time possible.",2,1732572449.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,0,1.0,False

I know these types of comparisons and questions have been beaten to death, but I could use some guidance for my situation:

I just bought the Vertuo Plus machine on the Black Friday deal Nespresso was having. I had my first cup yesterday of the Peppermint Twist, and while it was good I was definitely wired for the day with a minor headache afterwards. I like the flavors, but I could do without the high caffeine jitters.

I have a knack for getting decaf/half-caf Americanos from Starbucks (tall or grande), and I‚Äôm looking to try to replicate that at home. But if I wanted to get a larger pour into a 16 oz. travel tumbler, would I get 1 to 2 hot water flushes of the OL pod, then top it off with tea kettle water? Would something similar be possible with the Vertuo Plus pods?

I also know with the Essenza Mini I have the option to use third party pod manufacturers so I‚Äôm not tied into Nespresso‚Äôs decaf options. My wife doesn‚Äôt drink coffee (likes iced chai lattes), and my daughter likes hot chocolate, so I want to know if the third party pods that do chai or hot chocolate are any good or are they junk since they‚Äôre not specifically Nespresso?

It also helps that I found an Essenza Mini deal on Amazon for $115 instead of the $180 on Nespresso‚Äôs website. So I wouldn‚Äôt be paying any extra for the switch.

So there‚Äôs my dilemma:
Keep the Vertuo Plus and have the Nespresso half-decaf coffee pods, or get the Essenza Mini and put in a little more work for the Americanos and have more pod options?

Help me decide! TIA.",1,1732572339.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

My only solution to stopping eating so much sugar my brain cells are entirely fried is to stop eating all together, which ALSO fucks up my brain function.  

The obvious answer for someone like me would be to fix my eating disorder and deep dive into what foods to eat for optimal brain function but I don‚Äôt want that. I want to be the person who lives off a cup of coffee and an apple and still runs mental laps around everyone else. That‚Äôs all I want. 

Maybe when I run out of binge food I‚Äôll try restricting while making sure I‚Äôm getting enough electrolytes and water like I did back in highschool. 

I just wish my brain didn‚Äôt need food, that would make it a lot easier. I can not eat easily but I can‚Äôt control what I eat when I do. It‚Äôs nothing or everything and neither of thoes work.

","Hey,

  
Just wanted to share something wild I've been doing lately. I know the typical advice here is to never invest more than you're willing to lose, but hear me out:  
I've gone all in on $PEIRO. Yeah, you read that right. I've quit my job to promote this token. Before you think I've lost my mind, let me explain why I believe in this so much:  


* The Community: This isn't just about the token; it's about the people. I've been talking to my friends, family, even the guy at my local coffee shop about $PEIRO. There's a real sense of camaraderie and excitement.
* The Vision: $PEIRO isn't just another memecoin. It's got a real vision for growth, utility, and it's been getting some solid attention in the crypto space recently. They're rolling out some innovative features that could change how we think about digital assets.
* The Timing: Right now, it feels like the stars are aligning for $PEIRO. The market dip has made it a prime time for entry. It's like catching the last call at a bar before everyone realizes it's the best party in town.

I'm not here to convince you to go all in like me. I know that's not for everyone, and I'm probably a bit on the crazy side for doing it. But if you've got some spare crypto lying around, why not take a look?   


* Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. I'm just a guy who's betting big on something he believes in.

So, if you're curious, do your own research, but I genuinely think $PEIRO could be the next big thing. Let's make this an amazing ride together.  


Quit my job to shill $PEIRO, believe in the project, think it's a good time to buy. DYOR but I'm super bullish.

  
For those asking, yes, I've made contingency plans. I've got some savings, and I'm picking up freelance work. This isn't my first rodeo in crypto, but it's definitely the biggest bet I've placed.

My wife and I have been married for 40 years this year. For the past 20 years, since my daughter was born my wife has refused to be intimate with me. I have no knowledge of her having an affair and I sure as hell haven't either.  I have always been very sexual and she knew that when we married. When she cut me off she explained that she was asexual. And I have relied on porn for years since.

She is aware of not fulfilling or even attempting to fulfill my needs. i told her. She is now going to a sex counselor but after 20 years I have no hope of that working. She is my best friend (maybe my only friend, except for my lab) and about 10 years ago I tried to convince her that we needed to have an open marriage. She refused. She is not very verbal and I am very verbal.  I let the idea go.

A few nights ago i couldn't help but tell her that her lack of desire for me has ruined my life. I sometimes have small talk with an older woman or see an older woman at a coffee shop or the library and our eyes meet. I dont know if my desperation for love is obvious on my face, or not. But I do ""feel"" attraction sometimes on both sides.

When I got this job I noted that my coworkers aren't my cup of tea in general so I don't feel the need to share my personal life with them. I assume they are straight, ofc I can't know for sure. For so many years my whole friend group has consisted of queer people, I think I'm not used to straight people lmao.

Even though I don't really have the need to talk about my dating life (current girlfriend), a part of me just gets irritated when all of my coworkers talk about their boyfriends to me. They usually talk shit about them, stuff like their boyfriend not cleaning and looking after the home etc, which was a total culture shock to me tbh (not the cleaning / weaponized imcompetence). I could never talk shit about my girlfriend, let alone to someone I don't know... Shocks me!

I literally don't care about their boyfriends, though I'm kind and friendly to my coworkers. Part of me kind of wants to come out as lesbian to them so that... Maybe they would shut up about their boyfriends...? If they think that I don't relate to them (cuz I don't lol).

Hard to say. They haven't been homophobic (yet). They also talk shit about immigrants and disabled customers to me & to others.

 I REALLY want to come out to them rn. not because I want acceptance from them, but to idk... I'm having hard times putting it into words. For instance, I want them to stop venting about their boyfriends to me, thinking that I can relate to them, but I also want them to realize that minorities exist in your work place too, since they've catch them speak shit about minorities a lot.

Have you heard the good news? In 2 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠17, the apostle Paul writes to the church in Corinth: ‚ÄúAnyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!‚Äù

God created us and called us good, but we were born into a fallen world. A beautiful-yet-broken world. A stunning-yet-sinful world. A world where many would rather choose their own way instead of following and submitting to God. A world where others try to earn their own salvation, but fall painfully short.¬†

By the sheer grace of God, He has made a way for sinners through His Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus is the One who specializes in making all things new. 

Paul goes on to say in his letter:¬†

‚ÄúAnd all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠2 Corinthians‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠5‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠18‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NLT‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

To reconcile, by definition, means to ‚Äúmake peace‚Äù or to ‚Äúrestore a relationship.‚Äù

If you‚Äôve known the love, grace, forgiveness, and redemption of God, who‚Äîthrough Christ‚Äîreconciled you back to Himself, then you have everything you need to help others receive the same gift.

God has empowered you with the ministry of reconciliation‚Äîof restoring others back to Him. This reconciliation can happen anywhere: in coffee shops, in corporate offices, in classrooms, and in kitchens. You can remind a child about the grace that‚Äôs available to them when they make a mistake. You can remind an adult that they cannot sin so much or so badly they cannot receive the mercy of God.

Wherever people need God, He stands ready to be used by you.

God has entrusted and empowered you to shine His light, show His love, and help others be restored back into His arms.

PRAYER God, thank You for being the God who restores and brings peace. You are steady. You are good. I ask for Your strength to love and serve those around me. Help me share the healing and hope I have in You with others. In Jesus' name, Amen

She approached me first and after talking for a bit we noticed that we have a lot in common, I felt like we clicked. After the initial convo, she pretty much only talked to me and 2 other female friends while she was still there.

A while after, she asked me for the direction of my home saying that if we're headed in the same direction we could walk together, but unfortunately my home was in the opposite direction (I know I fumbled here, should've just went with her anyways üò≠). 

While she was preparing to leave I came up to her and asked her for her number, but after she put it in my phone she mentioned something along the lines of ""oh I'm kind of going through a situationship right now, but we can stay friends"" but after I said that I understand, she laughed and said that she was just joking, after which I gave her an awkward smile and said that I'll message her so we can organize something.

After this I went away for a bit and chilled with friends but I saw her go in the bathroom with a friend of hers for a while, and according to my friends her dad picked her up so she must've called him inside of there?  
Next day, I pop her a few texts apologizing for not sending a message sooner and asked her when she's free so we could grab coffee

Haven't herd from her yet, its been 4 days.

Neither of us were drunk that night, aside from her 'joke' at the end all of our other convos went pretty smooth. I've asked a bunch of my friends for advice but everyone gave different answers, I felt that she was showing genuine interest in me and I was showing interest in her as well so I don't really understand the ghost

I sent her a message on whatsapp and I got 2 gray checkmarks, which means she at the very least has the app installed on her phone, I was thinking of sending her a normal SMS as well but I have no idea if that's being annoying, creepy, or whatever

I don't really have a lot of experience in dating and so I don't know what the social norms are for these types of situations. Pretty much everyone here uses whatsapp, especially uni students such as us. I want to be respectful, but I can't help to think that she really was awesome

I'm ok with that but don't 100% trust him yet. I didn't find it a big deal as I'm friends with my high school sweetheart although we've never private messaged each other.  I also don't have a problem as long as there's open communication and I don't feel like he's hiding something.  Then I started snooping more (like everyday after he would go to bed I'd go through his computer history). I found out her husband very recently passed away after they started chatting, which again he didn't tell me about.   Tonight I found out that he ordered and had flowers and two gifts sent to her, spending $175 on her while bitching to me about me buying a coffee maker for $100.   I am just confused and unsure of how to go forward on this.  We've been having some issues but who doesn't after 37yrs together 35 yrs married.  Do I tell him I know even though I found out through snooping?  Can I get in legal trouble for going through his computer history?

The Ad Serving Platform team is thrilled to bring you this behind-the-scenes look at Reddit‚Äôs ad-serving system! Our team has the humble yet powerful job of keeping the ad magic running smoothly so that Reddit Ad‚Äôs various product teams can continue dazzling the world with endless possibilities.



Here‚Äôs what our team is responsible for:



* Ad Serving Infrastructure: We‚Äôre the architecture and operational excellence gurus, making sure our infrastructure is built like a skyscraper but flexible as a rubber band. Our system‚Äôs elasticity is crucial to our partner teams, allowing them to run their ad selection models with the reliability of your morning coffee.



* Ad Serving Platform: We own the platform that makes executing vertical teams‚Äô models as seamless as possible. Think of us as the tech world‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy button‚Äù for integrating new products, simplifying onboarding, and providing robust tools for debugging when things inevitably get too exciting.



Over the past few years, our team has tackled some mission-critical projects to ensure our system remains as scalable and reliable as the Reddit communities it supports. In this post, we‚Äôll share a few of the scaling challenges we‚Äôve encountered, plus a recent project where we boosted system availability while reducing infrastructure cost (yes, it is possible). We hope our journey gives you some fresh ideas and maybe a little inspiration for scaling your own systems.

# A brief history of Reddit Ad Serving

The functional requirements of Reddit‚Äôs Ad Serving system are refreshingly simple:



* Accept front-end requests and produce a curated set of ads.
* Incorporate various products to maximize advertisers‚Äô ROI while keeping users engaged and interested (instead of exasperated).



Like many backend systems, we began with a simple, single-service setup that handled all the ad selection tasks in a neat little package. But as our customer base (advertisers) began to grow like Reddit comment threads, scaling limitations hit fast. Those O(N) operations that once worked smoothly started feeling like they were running on yesterday‚Äôs Wi-Fi.



So, the next logical step? Sharding our customer base. This kicked off a series of redesign phases to keep our ad-serving system humming efficiently, no matter how much our business continues to climb.

# The challenges in scaling

With service architecture v2.1, we‚Äôre set up to handle some of the most resource-intensive operations‚Äîlike expensive targeting and complex modeling‚Äîin a separate, scalable service dedicated to a subset of advertisers. This way, we can scale these processes independently from the Ad Selector and other shards, giving our main systems some much-needed breathing room.



But scaling isn‚Äôt just about where we store and process our data. Sometimes, it‚Äôs about how seamlessly products are integrated into the request workflow. When a product starts playing a starring role in workflow orchestration, it‚Äôs all too easy to overlook the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù costs lurking in the background. Just like adding extra cheese to a pizza, a little overhead can be manageable‚Äîbut too much, and suddenly you‚Äôve got a system that‚Äôs weighed down and sluggish.



# Design and Redesign

# Select a single ad

The roles of Ad Selector and Ad Shards are clear and complementary:

* **Ad Selector**: Like a highly skilled traffic cop, Ad Selector validates and enriches incoming requests with extra context, sends them off to the individual shards, and then gathers all the responses to deliver the final ad lineup.
* **Ad Shards**: Each shard is a busy hive of activity, running a series of actions to choose local winners and executing a host of models from various teams to help identify the best ad candidates. Think of Ad Shards as the talent scouts of our system, making sure only the best ads make it to the spotlight.
* The challenges in scaling

With service architecture v2.1, we‚Äôre set up to handle some of the most resource-intensive operations‚Äîlike expensive targeting and complex modeling‚Äîin a separate, scalable service dedicated to a subset of advertisers. This way, we can scale these processes independently from the Ad Selector and other shards, giving our main systems some much-needed breathing room.

[The illustration above demonstrates how we select an ad to be displayed in a designated location. ](https://preview.redd.it/v7r2fd5z443e1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ee1fd9d58f180e5cbeb11113975a0f0d0b73b4)

# Select multiple ads

When it comes to filling multiple ad slots at once, things get a bit more complex:

* Not every ad is eligible for every slot.
* And not every ad performs equally well across all slots.

To ensure each slot maximizes advertiser ROI, we designed a specialized workflow that filters ads by eligibility for each position and scores them accurately during ranking. And here‚Äôs a key point: just because an ad doesn‚Äôt make the cut for one position doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs out of the game for another slot. After all, everyone deserves a second chance, especially ads!

The workflow looks something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/7bloxo87543e1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=6081e6420b496544ae044b53fa58df83652395a7

This design utilizes the majority of the code and workflow when the concept is initially formed. We simply provide slot specific context to each shard request, and let the filtering process respect each slot context, and job done.

# Identify the problem

While slot-specific processing gives ads more chances to be evaluated at the request level (great for business!), we noticed a big uptick in the load on our ad shard services. This increased load means our heavy models get invoked more frequently, putting a serious demand on our cluster‚Äôs resources.



When scaling issues come from all sides‚Äîmore DAUs, more advertisers, and stricter SLAs‚Äîit‚Äôs tempting to dive into code optimizations, compromise on latency to keep availability high, or even throw more infrastructure dollars at the problem, hoping it all smooths out eventually.



But here‚Äôs the thing: sometimes, no amount of extra infrastructure can fix the bottlenecks. Your cluster might hit its node scheduling limits, adding more shards could start backfiring on upstream services, and that delicate balance between latency and availability gets harder and harder to manage.



So, what do you do?



Well, we took a step back. Instead of throwing more resources at it, we analyzed our request workflow to see if it was as efficient as we assumed. And guess what? The opportunities for improvement were much bigger than we‚Äôd anticipated.

# The fix

Per-slot ad selection gives us precisely the right ads for each slot‚Äôs unique context, and that‚Äôs essential to the product. But here‚Äôs the twist: only a small slice of the actions in this selection process actually impact this ‚Äúprecision cut‚Äù in filtering out ineligible ads.

So, our solution? Trim out redundant operations that don‚Äôt influence outcomes or add any real business value at the per-slot level.

Here‚Äôs how we tackled it:

* **In the parallel ad sourcing stage** ‚Äì None of the candidate sources need slot-level information here. What really matters is user context‚Äîinterests, device type, that sort of thing. Slot-level specifics are just extra weight at this stage.
* **At the filtering level** ‚Äì Less than 5% of actions, like brand safety checks or negative keyword filtering, actually need to be slot-aware. These are tied to slot context only to ensure sensitive content doesn‚Äôt accidentally end up above or below certain posts.
* **In heavy model execution** ‚Äì Turns out, a different feature with much lower cardinality can get us the same results, letting us cut down on model invocations without losing accuracy. It‚Äôs like upgrading to a more efficient tool without sacrificing quality.
* **Finally, the ranking process** ‚Äì Here, slot-awareness is essential. Each candidate ad has different opportunities depending on the slot it‚Äôs aiming for, so we keep this step fully slot-aware to get the right ads in the right places.



By rewiring the execution pipeline this way, we‚Äôve brought the Adserver Shard pipeline‚Äôs workload down from O(N)‚Äîwhere¬† N¬† is the number of slots‚Äîto a sleek O(1). In doing so, we‚Äôve stripped away a hefty portion of the execution overhead, and significantly lightened the service‚Äôs networking and middleware load. It‚Äôs like switching from rush hour traffic to an express lane‚Äîsmoother, faster, and way less stressful on the system.

# How we did it

To implement this project, we divided it into two parts. We opted for this approach because our serving system is highly dynamic, with multiple teams continuously contributing to the codebase. This creates challenges in making progress while keeping the live system stable and avoiding discrepancies.

# Phase 1

In the first phase, we introduced new Thrift APIs for RPC calls to handle both global and slot-specific metadata. These requests were sent to AdServer Shards, where they were converted into multiple legacy requests and processed through the old pipeline in parallel.

Once the local auction results were gathered, they were parsed and merged into the new response API, minimizing changes to the shards and relying on the existing integration test suite.¬†

Additionally, in Ad-Selector, we introduced *stages* to logically organize request handling, with each stage returning a unique struct response. This allowed for independent unit testing. It also provided valuable analytics and diagnostics data around global auction results at each stage.Identify the problem

While slot-specific processing gives ads more chances to be evaluated at the request level (great for business!), we noticed a big uptick in the load on our ad shard services. This increased load means our heavy models get invoked more frequently, putting a serious demand on our cluster‚Äôs resources.

# Phase 2

In the second phase, we removed the looping logic and legacy requests in AdServer Shard, replacing them with a new pipeline that could select ad candidates and apply slot-specific filtering and ranking. This streamlined the process, eliminating unnecessary repetition of business logic.

https://preview.redd.it/auv5y7gj543e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8782a57e60ce0d0c910d0cf4d54153c1f506bf1b

# The result

  
The final results from this effort were truly exciting, with large-scale operational efficiency gains across our entire serving stack:

* QPS to the Adserver Shard pipeline dropped by about 50%, cutting network-in traffic by 50% and network-out by 35%.
* QPS to our heavy model inference server dropped by 42%, giving us valuable headroom before hitting cluster capacity.
* Availability increased significantly thanks to fewer operations required per request, reducing the chance of failures.



On the cost side:

* Resource allocation for Ad Selector dropped by 30%, primarily from needing fewer Adserver Shard connections and spending less time on long-tail requests.
* Shard costs dropped by nearly 50% thanks to a lighter workload.
* Inference server costs fell by around 35%, with additional savings from reduced storage layer lookups and lowered network overhead.



All told, this optimization translates to millions in annual infrastructure savings and a substantial boost in cluster capacity, which also unblocks compute power for other product developments.

# What we learned (and what we hope you'd learn from us)

Designing a scalable system is challenging, especially when it‚Äôs highly distributed with many moving parts. In a fast-paced engineering environment, we often focus heavily on techniques, tools, and the quickest route to achieving our business goals.



Hopefully, this post serves as a reminder that smart request pattern design is equally critical and can drive fundamental improvements across the system.

It was by far the hardest struggle I‚Äôve had in my adult life. I had a relatively quick divorce at around 8 months from having the news broke to the final documents being signed. It felt like 4 years. 

I remember going to get a coffee on my breaks every day at work, and reading this subreddit‚Äôs posts to commiserate and understand the best path forward. I would spend an hour plus on my 15 minute breaks because I just didn‚Äôt care anymore about my job or anything else really.  I thought I was a dead man, sadly through my own or someone else‚Äôs actions. I had given up on my life and no one I worked with or talked with every day wanted to darken their day by listening to me. This subreddit gave me hope at the best and a feeling of mutual understanding at the worst.

Reading other men‚Äôs stories and going to therapy weekly are the only two reasons I made it out alive, I am sure of that. PLEASE prioritize your mental health and find a therapist if it‚Äôs at all possible, while going through a divorce.  It‚Äôs such a huge part of why I am SO glad I made it through, and have found the path I was always supposed to be on.

Looking back now I can see that while married I was convinced it was something wonderful, but that I was really just coping. Now I am doing all of the things in my life I always had the potential to, but was held back by being married to the wrong person.  My job, relationships, family, fitness and every aspect of my life now is something I never thought could be as good as it is now.

The Product Information Summary helps us find products that support our well-being, including fiber supplement options. We can feel good about what we‚Äôre putting in our bodies! It‚Äôs non-GMO and made from natural ingredients, which means less concern about harmful additives finding their way into our system.

You sit down at home, drink your morning beverage, knowing that everything you‚Äôre ingesting is exactly what you paid for. That peace of mind is priceless. Dieticians extol the virtues of soluble fiber and detoxification as they relate to overall health. Their support provides an additional layer of trust.

When experts list the product‚Äôs benefits, such as improved intestinal health, it helps us make an informed decision. We all want to feel confident that what we purchase will add to our lives. The product's focus on detoxing the body helps achieve this goal, making it an intelligent addition to our daily routine.

A money-back guarantee takes the stress out of trying something new. If we‚Äôre not satisfied, we can get our money back. This type of assurance goes a long way to show the confidence the manufacturers have in the product. It acts like a safety net, giving us permission to roll the dice without the risk of a financial loss.

It‚Äôs also nice to know that the company stands behind its product.

# Reviews

I ended up trusting the product's safety and quality due to the expert support behind it. When professionals recommend something, I take their advice seriously. Their validation gave me the nudge I needed to try it out.

You don‚Äôt run into a product like this every day. It checks all the boxes for how safe and high quality it is, and it does so with confidence.

# Benefits and Potential Drawbacks

There are several benefits to using Product Information Summary, so it may be worth it to implement it. We love how it cleans the body from toxins. Imagine being lighter, more energetic, and generally healthier. It‚Äôs similar to wiping your slate clean. Plus, it helps digestion. If you‚Äôve ever experienced feeling sluggish or bloated after meals, this could be a true game-changer. You start to notice changes in how your body processes food. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôve hit the reset button on your health!

Some things may take a little getting used to. For example, you may need to drink more water than you typically do. That‚Äôs not a terrible thing, but it‚Äôs good to keep that in mind. Staying hydrated is imperative to help your body adjust to the effects the product has.

There may be a brief period where your body adjusts to the new routine. It's a bit like when you begin a new training program; your body just needs time to catch up.

In my experience, the benefits are absolutely tangible. You might be more awake, or perhaps your skin starts to glow. Remember, everyone‚Äôs different. Results may vary, depending on individual health conditions. For some, changes may be rapid and conspicuous. For others, it could take some additional time.

For the most part, people are noticing a really great change in how they feel overall. Now you know when I first tried it, I did have some initial discomfort. My body was figuring out what was going on, and it felt a little wonky at first. Those early bugs were nothing compared with the benefits I‚Äôve gained.

The feeling of well-being and all of these health improvements make it all worth it. Most people who've tried it agree that any temporary hurdles are small compared to the long-term gains.

# Proper Usage for Optimal Results

To get the most out of the fiber supplement information, take the prescribed dosage each day. Stick with this routine for a few weeks. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up by skipping days. Think about trying to build a house, taking a few days off whenever you want to. That is not going to hold up.

Consistency builds a strong foundation, and the same goes for your health. Over time, you‚Äôll start to see the benefits as they compound. We all know good things take time. Your health improvements won‚Äôt happen overnight, but they will happen.

Drinking plenty of water is equally important. You want to drink an extra 250 ml of water with each portion of your natural fiber sources. Picture this: you wouldn't drive a car without enough fuel, right? Your body works the same way.

Water makes your body absorb the product more effectively.‚Äù Plus, staying hydrated keeps you feeling great. So, when you take each portion, down that extra water. You‚Äôll feel the difference. Not only will it help the product work better, your overall well-being will improve.

The key to actually making a dent in your health and well-being is to use the product regularly. It‚Äôs sort of like brushing your teeth. You wouldn‚Äôt skip that, right? Doing it regularly keeps everything in control.

Before too long, you‚Äôll notice the changes: more energy, better mood, and general betterment. It‚Äôs the consistent use that makes the magic happen. Stick with this one, and you‚Äôll be glad that you did.

In reading reviews, I saw a lot of people saying the same thing. These tips will help you get the best results by sticking to the guidelines. Above all, consistency is key. It makes all the difference in the world.

When I skipped days, I didn't feel the same benefits. When I stayed on track, I felt great. My energy levels increased, and I felt more focused. It‚Äôs just like following the map to get where you‚Äôre going. You stay the course, and you will get where you want to go.

Mainly my eGFR, Creatinine, and iron.

In 2022 my eGFR was 98. In 2023 it was 96. This year it dropped to 81.

Creatinine went from a trend of .80 last year and in 2022, to .92 this year.

Iron was at 92 last year and if jumped to 150 this year. 

I am a 40F. I do not have diabetes. I‚Äôm not pre-diabetic either. My blood pressure is normal. I am 5 feet 0 inches, 128lbs, BMI 25. Which has all been steady the last two years. I do not smoke. I only drink alcohol moderately. I don‚Äôt drink soda regularly. I limit heavily processed foods. I walk about 6 miles a week. I do take NSAIDs only when needed (couple times a month for menstrual cramps).

I take a multivitamin every day. But that‚Äôs about it on regular supplements. I don‚Äôt take iron so I don‚Äôt understand the spike in iron. Melatonin I take when needed. I did take some about 2 days before test, just due to anxiety. I fasted for about 10 hours before the test. I only had black coffee and water that morning.

I haven‚Äôt made any major changes in my diet. Exercise has been the same the last couple years. 

I‚Äôm concerned about these jumps because there seems to be no explanation for them. Everything else checked out pretty much steady from years prior. 

I did schedule an appointment with my regular doctor but it‚Äôs not for another month. In the meantime, I‚Äôm just curious as to what this could be.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I (F, 32) met Joe (M, 29) in an art school providing night lessons.
I had a big crush on Joe two years ago. We were mostly friendly, working on art projects together with other friends of the school.
I hit a very rough patch mental health-wise one year ago, and it was enough for Joe to drift away. He also began to date Mina (22), a friend of a friend.
We were a whole group used to get drinks after class. When I saw Joe and Mina getting closer, I felt bad and envious, and talked about it to some mutual friends, thinking my secrets would be safe with them. 

Things got even more awkward between me and Joe. He was actively avoiding me, unless when working on art projects together when he had to. I had no clue why at the time and felt more and more isolated. 
Since he's a very polarizing individual in school, I got the feeling the whole group of friends we had turnt away from me. 
I can't really get over a crush unless I confess and gets told off, but the situation felt too vulnerable and difficult for me to dare say anything.

Interesting stuff happened this summer but I'll come back to that later in the post. 

Fast forward to this autumn, I finally gather the bravery to tell Joe my feelings. He rejects me as planned and tells me he got very cold because of things I said about Mina.
I was flabbergasted. I was obviously envious as said earlier but never thought anything bad about Mina. I think she's pretty, super clever and funny, globally a delight to be around.
I learnt our mutual friends had blabbered about my crush on Joe, had amplified and deformed something I said about Joe and Mina ""hooking up"" in front of me (it's a word really more nuanced in my birth language) and interpreted something I said against Joe at a party as something against Mina. I had told some stupid things too, like about their age difference.
I offered coffee to Mina first, to apologize, then to Joe, then to mutual friends to air every misunderstanding.

I feel better now but things are still very tense between me, Joe and Mina who I think are still keeping me at arm's length. 

Back to this summer.
I was globally feeling pretty over Joe at this point.
I had created a NSFW reddit account, for reasons.
I was searching for men in my area when, lo and behold, in a subreddit dedicated to it : nudes of Joe.
I'm 100% sure it's him, lots of pictures had almost all of his face. He commented on hundreds women's pictures too.
At first I thought this was a sign he and Mina were broken off, since the account's activity had stopped for a few months when they began to date. The new NSFW pictures were more recent.

As you know now, it's not the case. They're completely still together, and I really feel like this is cheating.
I obviously hate that, I hate men cheating, especially since I learnt this autumn that Mina has had really rough times with men. 
But I also don't want to be the one telling Mina. How in hell would that be received from the girl who had a crush on her boyfriend?

Anyway, I don't know what to do. I think Mina deserves better. I want to get back at Joe. I feel like a coward.

Do you have any advice so I could let her know without getting too involved? 

TL;DR : I saw my crush's NSFW reddit account. He's in an exclusive relationship but things are difficult between me and his girlfriend. I want her to know but don't want to be the one to tell her. ",2,1732569275.0,relationship_advice,9,0.67,False

I've money aside for one and can easily come up with the rest for the other if it's deemed worth it. I'd like to buy once, and not buy twice if the Impress won't meet my needs. Or is it just as good at everything, or is just the Express the best option.

Ascaso says this machine needs to be run on a 20A circuit, but my coffee bar is in my apartment living room and runs on a 15A circuit. My apartment is a rental, so upgrading the circuit is obviously off the table. I could move my machine to the kitchen, but I don't have the countertop space for it.

I know a couple people have reported that the machine runs fine on 15A circuits, since it only exceeds 15A at startup if you heat up both thermoblocks simultaneously.

I've been on a mission to find the perfect coffee machine for my home, and I thought I'd share my journey with you all. After months of research and testing different machines, I've finally found some great options that I think you'll love.

I used to spend way too much money at coffee shops every morning, and honestly, it was getting ridiculous. That's when I decided to invest in a good coffee machine for my home. Trust me, it's been a game-changer!

First things first ‚Äì what makes a coffee machine ""good""? For me, it comes down to a few key things:
- Ease of use (because who wants to struggle before their morning coffee?)
- Consistency in brewing
- Durability
- Value for money
- Clean-up time

I've found that automatic drip coffee makers are perfect for beginners and those who need their coffee quick. But if you're feeling fancy, espresso machines can bring that caf√© experience right to your kitchen.

One machine that really impressed me was this fantastic model I found on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine). It's got all the features you'd want in a home coffee maker, plus it's super easy to clean.

Here's what I've learned about choosing the right coffee machine:

1. Consider your coffee preferences
Do you like strong espresso or regular drip coffee? Some machines can do both, but they're usually pricier.

2. Think about capacity
If you're the only coffee drinker at home, a single-serve machine might be perfect. But if you're brewing for family or guests, you'll want something bigger.

3. Counter space matters
Some machines are pretty bulky, so measure your counter space before buying.

4. Extra features
Things like programmable brewing, temperature control, and built-in grinders are nice to have but remember they'll affect the price.

5. Maintenance requirements
Some machines need more attention than others. Make sure you're ready for the upkeep.

My personal recommendation? Check out this collection of top-rated coffee machines here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. There's something for every budget and preference.

Pro tip: Whatever machine you choose, always use filtered water and clean your machine regularly. It makes a huge difference in taste!

I've noticed that having a good coffee machine at home has actually helped me save money and time. Plus, there's something really satisfying about making your own perfect cup of coffee exactly how you like it.

Remember, the best coffee machine for you depends on your specific needs and preferences. Don't just go for the most expensive one thinking it'll be the best. Take your time, read reviews, and choose one that fits your lifestyle.

Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features. I'd love to help you find your perfect coffee companion!",1,1732568639.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1gztu6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1gztu6w/experiences_while_searching_for_a_bride/,Experiences While Searching for a Bride,"* **Bride 1** The bride's father mentioned that their daughter earns a modest amount compared to mine, and although I didn‚Äôt say or do anything to belittle them, from the very first conversation, they started justifying it. They implied that my higher earnings were simply due to years of experience, trying to downplay it. Their daughter‚Äôs degree was MCA from a private college compared to my degree from a reputed institution, and as far as I know, she wouldn‚Äôt even be eligible for many IT job roles. When it came to matching kundalis, the father claimed we had excellent compatibility (34 gunas), while our independent check (using the same birth details) showed only 12 gunas. He insisted a highly educated pandit had calculated it manually in just a couple of minutes. Having some understanding of the process, I know manual calculations take time, and such discrepancies raised doubts. He even sent a screenshot, which appeared to be a manipulated or cut piece of a generated document. The father then remarked that traditionally, it‚Äôs the bride‚Äôs side that needs to be cautious during marriage talks, not the groom‚Äôs, which felt like gaslighting. Overall, the interaction seemed suspicious and left a bad impression.
* **Bride 2** This bride‚Äôs father requested multiple photos of me and then commented on my appearance, saying I looked darker than expected. This was surprising, as no one in my life has ever said this before, whoever meets me have asked my origin as I look way too much Fair. Ironically, his daughter was short, overweight, and looked older than her stated age, but we refrained from making any such comments. They also had an unusual demand that I relocate to their preferred city, despite me having a well-constructed, independent home in my city and working from home. I had designed the home with privacy concerns in mind, including separate kitchens and spaces, even another house few km away , incase more privacy is required later, but they seemed fixated on relocation. When I mentioned my setup, they defensively exaggerated their own property holdings, which seemed improbable given their financial background. Their behavior over a phone call was strange too; the father seemed annoyed about even making the call, complaining unnecessarily. When my earnings were mentioned as a range, he accused me of lying, even though the range was clearly stated on the platform. Ironically, his profile also listed a salary range, but no accusations were made there. The bride‚Äôs academic qualifications‚ÄîBTech and an online MBA from a private institution‚Äîalso didn‚Äôt align with their lofty expectations. This mismatch felt disingenuous and staged.
* **Bride 3** This bride had completed a BTech from a mid-tier institution and an online MTech program in data science. She emphasized her work at a reputed company as a data scientist and stated her requirements for a groom: only from IITs/NITs/IIMs and only in the data science and CSE field. The irony was that her own qualifications didn‚Äôt align with the standards she was demanding. My educational and career background far exceeded hers, salary more than double of her, yet her attitude seemed dismissive and entitled. It felt hypocritical to demand qualities in a partner that didn‚Äôt match her own credentials.
* **Bride 4** This bride‚Äôs brother handled all communication, and when my father requested to speak to the bride‚Äôs father, the brother got defensive. He claimed their father was too old-fashioned to understand and too busy with court work to take a phone call. The brother insisted that he had complete authority and blamed us for not respecting their system. This was perplexing, as they were the ones being unresponsive and defensive. When pressed further, they shifted the blame onto us, accusing us of wasting time, even though it was their side that showed no willingness to communicate openly, also they seemed to be trying to rush the process.
* **Bride 5** This bride‚Äôs profile understated her salary significantly. When we connected, her family made unreasonable demands, such as sending a biodata late at night and asking me to travel to another city to meet her with no confirmation of interest. Eventually, they rejected the proposal the next morning, making it clear they were only collecting profiles without serious intent. Her qualifications‚Äîa private MTech‚Äîhad led to a good job during a recent industry boom. However, the way they misrepresented her background and wasted others‚Äô time was disrespectful and frustrating.
* **Bride 6** The bride shared her contact details along with her sister‚Äôs but kept her father entirely out of the discussions. She insisted I travel all the way to another city just to have a casual coffee conversation with her. This seemed unreasonable‚Äîwhy should I make such a significant effort without any confirmation of interest? If they were serious, the bride could have called, connected over chat, or even arranged a video call. Travel could then be considered if there was mutual interest, but all their requests felt one-sided. Additionally, the bride claimed to be two years younger than me, but upon checking, I noticed she had somehow completed her 10th and 12th-grade board exams a year before me. While this might suggest she was exceptionally smart, it didn‚Äôt seem likely given her qualifications (MCA) and professional background. With the same work experience as mine, her salary was half of mine, further raising doubts. It seemed she had misrepresented her age, and overall, the interaction felt like a waste of time rather than a serious effort.
* **General Observations** Many families seem to leave proposals in limbo without any closure or treat the process as a game of leverage. Some justify their behavior with manipulative tactics or unrealistic demands, and many seem to expect a partner who is vastly more accomplished or better-off than themselves.I believe in authenticity, natural appearances, and self-acceptance‚Äîqualities that one has to live with daily in a marriage. However, I‚Äôve noticed a lack of such values in many interactions, with people relying on filters, makeup, or inflated credentials to project a certain image.It‚Äôs frustrating to encounter so much entitlement, gaslighting, and belittling during this process. I firmly believe in mutual respect and equality in a relationship, and I don‚Äôt see why I should settle for a mismatch or tolerate manipulative behavior. While arranged marriages are inherently complex, basic respect and honesty shouldn‚Äôt be too much to ask.",2,1732568635.0,Arrangedmarriage,1,1.0,False

This review is a personal update on my experience with the Speediance Gym Monster 2.0. I want to be upfront: this is not a sponsored review, nor did I receive the product for free. I purchased it at full price via Amazon, and my goal is simply to share my honest feedback to help others make an informed decision. I‚Äôm also a U.S. Navy (AT) veteran residing in South Texas, and if you're skeptical, feel free to check my¬†[Reddit profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/14NSTL/)‚ÄîI‚Äôm a moderator of two communities and enjoy contributing genuine insights. You can find my¬†[original review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeedianceCommunity/comments/1gs7fhi/honest_review_my_experience_with_the_speedience/). I also use ChatGPT as a tool to edit and refine my writing for clarity, which some have mistaken for an AI-written review. I‚Äôve chosen to leave the structure and grammar polished because it looks clean and professional.

# Functionality and Usability Updates

**Unit Design and Setup**

The height and width of the unit work well for an average-height male in the U.S., and I‚Äôve had no trouble with the cable positioning. Each position is clearly labeled (e.g., L0 to L9), making it easy to follow instructions during workouts. It‚Äôs compact yet stable, with thoughtful engineering that supports a variety of exercises.

One standout feature is the sleep mode. Unlike concerns raised about the Gym Monster 1.0 being loud or needing to stay unplugged, the 2.0 can stay plugged in without issue. When you put it in sleep mode, it‚Äôs silent and wakes instantly when needed‚Äîno fuss.

**Power Requirements**

There‚Äôs no need for a 20-amp outlet, as some rumors suggest. A standard 15-amp household outlet works fine, provided the machine has a dedicated circuit. Avoid sharing the outlet with power-hungry appliances (e.g., coffee makers), as this could trip the breaker. For my setup, I‚Äôve run a fan on the same circuit with no issues, but I keep other high-draw devices unplugged.

**Display and Screen Features**

The display is bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. Even at the lowest brightness setting, it‚Äôs sufficient for day or night use. While the pixel density isn‚Äôt comparable to a 4K computer screen, it‚Äôs more than adequate for its purpose. You might notice individual pixels up close, but it‚Äôs irrelevant at a normal viewing distance.

**Audio and Bluetooth Functionality**

The system has a volume mixer for background music, voice, and sound effects, which is a nice touch. The Bluetooth ring pairs reliably, but the connection sound is excessively loud, and I haven't figured out how to adjust it. The ring works great as long as you wear it securely on a finger that suits your exercises, ensuring the button orientation avoids accidental presses that unload the weight.

# Accessories and Build Quality

The included accessories, such as the handles and rope, are of good quality and functional. I‚Äôve seen some users replace the rope with third-party options, but I find the provided one sufficient. The optional¬†[accessories organizer](https://www.speediance.com/collections/speediance-accessories/products/speediance-accessories-organizer)¬†is a worthwhile addition for keeping everything organized, though you can also use magnetic hooks for a cheaper alternative.

The platform is well-sized for stability, and the machine feels solid during use. The cables are upgraded to last twice as long as the 1.0 model.¬†[Replacements](https://www.speediance.com/collections/speediance-accessories/products/speediance-cable-replacement)¬†are reasonably priced, and Speediance allows users to perform repairs themselves‚Äîa rarity in fitness equipment.

# Connectivity and Subscription Insights

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity are excellent, even with my machine located far from the router. The antennas on the back of the 2.0 unit seem to help a lot. The machine also has unused USB-A and USB-C ports, which may be leveraged in future updates.

The subscription and warranty are tied to the unit itself, not the buyer. This means you retain the lifetime subscription (available at the time of this review) and warranty regardless of whether you purchase directly from Speediance or through a retailer like Amazon. The warranty starts when you power on the unit, not at the time of purchase, which is a thoughtful feature.

# Global Outlook and Competitor Analysis

**Company Operations and Transparency**

For those interested in learning more about Speediance‚Äôs operations and history as a company, their¬†[Alibaba page](https://speediance.en.alibaba.com/index.html)¬†provides an overview. It includes photos of the team, details on their R&D and production processes, as well as their certifications and participation in international exhibitions. This level of transparency helps build trust for those who might be skeptical about Speediance or concerned about their longevity in the competitive fitness market. The page serves as an excellent resource for anyone looking to better understand the company‚Äôs global presence and commitment to quality.

**Market Presence**

Speediance has a strong international presence, selling in 27 countries, which positions them uniquely against competitors like Tonal. Their strategy appears more sustainable, avoiding the overextension that impacted companies like Tonal during the COVID boom. Additionally, Speediance has ventured into commercial gym equipment with innovative machines that integrate their software and screen technology, setting them apart in the market.

**Economic Considerations**

Potential tariffs in the U.S. on materials like aluminum, motors, and chips could lead to price increases in the future. If you‚Äôre considering a purchase, it may be wise to buy soon to avoid these potential costs. This is, of course, speculative but worth considering for budget-conscious buyers.

**Upcoming Product: VeloNix Bike**

The¬†[VeloNix](https://www.speediance.com/pages/velonix), an upcoming fitness bike, looks promising with its all-aluminum die-cast frame and compact design. Based on feedback from the admin on Speediance‚Äôs Facebook group, it should be available on Amazon by mid-January. I plan to purchase it through Amazon for the reliable delivery experience and will provide a review once I‚Äôve had time to test it.

# Closing Thoughts

The Speediance Gym Monster 2.0 continues to impress me with its thoughtful design, functional upgrades, and reliable performance. Whether you‚Äôre upgrading from the 1.0 or purchasing your first smart gym system, this machine delivers value and quality.

1gztb0m,http://linkedin.com/in/blinor-kajtazi-b441b0233,üë®‚Äçüíª Frontend Vue Developer LFG (Looking for Growth),"Hey Redditors,

I‚Äôm a passionate Frontend Developer hailing from Kosovo‚Äîa small country with big dreams (and great coffee). I‚Äôve spent the last few years immersed in the world of Vue.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, building things that look great, work even better, and don‚Äôt break when you resize your browser (you‚Äôre welcome).

üí° Here‚Äôs why you might want to swipe right on me (metaphorically):
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve built user-friendly, responsive apps that balance clean design with smooth functionality. One highlight: bingoemcasa.com (yes, it‚Äôs as fun as it sounds).
	‚Ä¢	Worked on SaaS products where I tackled challenges like real-time tracking, inventory management, and making data dashboards that won‚Äôt put you to sleep.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not just about the frontend eye-candy‚ÄîI know my way around RESTful APIs, state management with Vuex, and writing clean, maintainable code.

üîß My toolkit includes:
	‚Ä¢	Tailwind CSS for styling that‚Äôs faster than my morning coffee.
	‚Ä¢	Figma to bridge the gap between design and code (because ‚Äúpixel-perfect‚Äù is a lifestyle).
	‚Ä¢	Git for version control (because chaos is for my laundry pile, not my projects).

But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI‚Äôm currently on the hunt for my next adventure. I‚Äôm looking for a remote Frontend Developer role where I can geek out over JavaScript, contribute to meaningful projects, and learn from a talented team.

üéØ Why you should care:
I‚Äôm not just looking for a job; I‚Äôm looking for a place where I can make a difference. I genuinely believe in creating user experiences that feel good‚Äîapps that people love coming back to. If your team values clean code, collaboration, and the occasional nerdy joke, we might just be a match.

üíå DM me if you‚Äôve got an opportunity‚Äîor even just advice! Check out my LinkedIn for more about me. If nothing else, I‚Äôll take a virtual high-five or some karma for putting myself out here.

Let‚Äôs build something awesome together.

1gztagg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gztagg/did_i_do_something_wrong/,Did I do something wrong,"Last week I (28m) approached a women (30f) that takes the same bus as me to get to our daily obligations (me to work, she to uni/college) and asked her out and for her phone number. She immediately said yes and we talked during the 10 minute bus drive, I wished her a nice day and we said that we will talk about times to meet up for a coffee or breakfast. She seemed genuinely happy that I asked her out and approached her and interested about my job. 

After not meeting her for the rest of last week, I texted her on Sunday and asked if she was still interested to meet up and when she had time, but instead of getting an answer she pretty much just ghosted me and I didn't even met her at the bus station. I'm not gonna lie this confuses me and it is kinda hard for me to cope and let go of this situation as I'm usually rather popular with women and this was the first time that I actively approached someone who I didn't knew. All my other relationships ""just happened"" as I got to know all my exes from school/ work/ friends. I don't wanna text her again as I feel like it would come off as needy/clingy and I don't wanna make her feel uncomfortable, as I'm already worried that she will start taking a different bus to get away from any awkward situation that could happen at the bus station. I already made up my mind and will not approach her if we meet again as ""no answer is a no as an answer"".

Did I do something wrong, by not texting her the same day? Was it wrong to say that I wanna invite her to coffee/breakfast? Is this some kind of ""hard to get shenanigans""?
Everyone always says ""the worst thing she can say is no"" but ngl her saying yes, having one short chat in the bus and then her ghosting me is 100% worse than a simple decline...",1,1732567341.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1gzt9nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1gzt9nk/pcos_improvement/,PCOS Improvement,"Hello! This is my first post ever on this app. I found out I had PCOS about two years ago (I am 25 now) when I went through a highly stressful 4 months. It felt like my symptoms sprung on me in an instant, and after that moment, I could never get rid of them. After researching it and finding out my mom also had/has PCOS, many moments from my childhood through my early 20s made sense. I would not say that I am in remission, but I finally have some peace, so I thought I would share what I have been doing. So many of you guys, and these posts have helped me, encouraged me, and made my silent emotions feel heard. Sometimes, you want to cry and live in your frustration because it's frustrating; sometimes, you need a new perspective that eliminates that frustration. I have found all of that on Reddit, so thank you!

Growing up, Me and my sister both struggled with dark hair on our upper lip and the back of our legs, and we always got cysts/razor burn on our thighs, no matter what we did. Couldn't help but notice none of our other friends had to deal with it. We also had dark discoloration on our armpits and legs. We got our periods at 13 and 14, but they were so sporadic until our 20's. Our mom said that it was normal because that is how she was, so that's all we knew. During my stressful period of life, I wasn't sleeping, had such high levels of anxiety, and developed hirsutism. My cycle was super painful and unpredictable, and I felt so inflamed; I also never used to get acne and was getting painful cysts all over my neck, receding hairline, and oily and scaly skin. Fast forward to now, I think I finally have a regimen working for me. I am only 1 month in with everything below, but to say the difference is drastic is an understatement.

I cut out most dairy products, I am not 100% disciplined because I love cheese and cappuccinos, but cutting out yogurt (which I used to have every day to hit my protein goals) has cut down on my bloating and jaw acne.

I have cut back on carbs but have not eliminated my sourdough bread, lol. However, I have made myself more aware of carbs and try to choose the right food accordingly.

Every morning, I have a shot of high-quality olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, and Ceylon cinnamon to help with inflammation and metabolism. Who knows if it's doing anything, but I enjoy it, so who cares?

I eat things like sardines, avocados, and sweet potatoes 2-3 times a week.

I try not to eat processed food, seed oils, and extra sugar. For example, If I choose not to add milk to my coffee, I will not add oat; I will have it black. Everyone can choose to do what they want, no judgement. I just didn't realize how many additives were in things, so either making my own oat milk or having it black has helped me stick with whole foods.

I do, however, enjoy the 80/20 mindset. Sometimes, a burger and fry, with a beer or G&T, with my husband at my favorite neighborhood bar is elite, and nothing compares. That's a date I never want to stop having. Sometimes, that oat milk at Starbucks hits differently. Balance.

I drink two cups of spearmint tea a day. I continue to read that everywhere and that it works for some and doesn't for others. In the last month, I noticed a REAL change by taking a spearmint supplement along with the spearmint tea. I also add two different tea bags to one cup. Example: This morning, I made some tea with one spearmint bag and one peppermint bag in 12oz of water, two teas, but I only had to drink one cup.

Also, I will have spearmint with raspberry (during my period), moringa, and/or green tea. I will do the same in the evening. I also take 2-3 capsules of a spearmint supplement, one in the morning and two at night. It's 400mg per capsule so that I may be taking too much, but so far, my skin has NEVER looked better; I am glowing. I also haven't had to shave or pluck every day. This cycle is my first time ovulating without a cyst on my jaw in about a year. After two weeks, I saw more improvement than in the past few months with only taking the spearmint tea 1-2 a day.

The other supplements I take are:

Inositol (Ovasital), prenatal (EUnatural), fish oil (I take a third of the suggested serving size), zinc (10mg), vitamin D (1000), Coq10, echinacea, saw palmetto, spearmint.

My cycles are now 30-33 days apart, and I have less unwanted hair growth and hair growing around my hairline, less acne, glowing skin, and no bloating. I am thrilled.

I also work out with kettlebells and do yoga/stretching. I have recently started running and run about 10 miles a week. I was so scared to work out and do cardio for so long because of cortisol and whatnot, but I have broken out of that. I used to hate running, but I read somewhere, ""If it's something you don't want to do, maybe that's the thing you really should do."" I probably botched the quote, but I have found such freedom and determination from running, which has helped my mood with PCOS. Do what makes you happy and what helps YOU!

I am unsure if this will help anybody or if you just need some encouragement while you scour Reddit, but remember to be kind to yourself. Life isn't fair, and if it were, we wouldn't be here, but we are stronger for it.

Like me, maybe you think Reddit isn‚Äôt the most romantic place to meet a soulmate, but here we are, trying our luck and hoping for the best. Maybe you‚Äôve posted here before, and I saw it, felt a spark, but nerves held me back. I‚Äôm still looking though, I have my fingers and everything else crossed that we‚Äôll come across each other one day.

I‚Äôm looking for my Morticia, someone passionate, daring, and as smitten as I am. I want that electric connection that makes the world think we‚Äôre crazy, when really, it‚Äôs just us, living in our little bubble of love and laughter. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm adventurous and unapologetically cheeky and hoping my soulmate shares my mischievous side, in and out of the bedroom. Maybe we‚Äôre more similar? Mind like a sewer? Bedroom drawer full of toys? Shopping wish lists full of potential fun and shenanigans? TMI? Possibly‚Ä¶ but why hide who I am, why not be myself and hopefully find my perfect match along the way.

I‚Äôm 28, based in the West Midlands (UK), and work full-time in the NHS which allows me to pay bills and my OF subscriptions (I‚Äôm not actually subscribed but I could be convinced‚Ä¶ maybe). I‚Äôm financially secure with a house and car, no strings or debts. I‚Äôve got a cuddly dad bod (which I‚Äôm working on), blue eyes, short brown hair and an occasional beard.

Personality wise, I‚Äôm a mix of rational and whimsical, ambitious and relaxed, logical and romantic. Call me an INTJ-T Aquarius who‚Äôs somehow both calm and mischievous. I‚Äôm an ambivert who loves cooking, baking, storytelling, and diving into Marvel, Doctor Who, or random YouTube rabbit holes. I like walks, board games, video games (Minecraft, Fallout, Assassin‚Äôs Creed), and music like Imagine Dragons or Lewis Capaldi. My sense of humour is a mix of dad jokes, innuendos, and sarcasm, I hope to find someone who can match me.

Food wise, I‚Äôm a sucker for roast dinners, pasta, and pizza, just keep the onions and olives far away, and we‚Äôre golden. For drinks I like Tea and hot chocolate, coffee and alcohol, not so much. I‚Äôm open to trying new things and finding joy in the little quirks.

I can be anxious, spacey, and mischievous, but I‚Äôm also caring, resourceful, and romantic. I dream of companionship, curiosity, and building a future, hopefully with my soulmate.

1gzt6fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gzt6fo/aita_for_suspecting_my_fiance/,AITA for suspecting my fiance?,"My fiance and I have lived happily together for 4 years now. We have what I could describe as a very beautiful relationship, with plenty of freedom for both and lots of trust. I'm 50 and she is 40.
We are both divorced from our previous spouses. I keep a distant but very cordial relationship with my ex-wife, because she is a senior partner in my company, and the mother of my now adult kids, who live independently. My fiance's ex-husband is drunk jerk who would not miss a chance to talk to her, just to keep having a presence in her life, but she has always seemed to be able to handle him, though I honestly see no reason for why she has to put up with that.
My work takes me away from home often, at least 10-12 days every month, sometimes a bit more. She is far more social than I am, and has lots of friends. I know when I'm away she goes out with them, and has even invited some to the house, for dinner or to have coffee, etc. That is somethig I'm totally cool with. I trust her and she is a mature adult who's never given me s reason not to trust her.
That is until a few months ago.
Something happened and I just can't quite figure out why I'm so uncomfortable with that.
Context: there's this guy I'll call A. He is an old friend of hers, predating me, and used to be best friends with her ex. They used to hang out a lot together and she says he is one of her best friends. She told me A has always had a thing for her, and apparently that was the reason why her ex-husband and A became distant while they were married, and stopped hanging out and eventalking to each other after some time, but she continued in touch with him regardless.
At first I did not tought much of it and simply considered A has good taste in women. I knew they chat often and she sees him now and then for lunch when she has to run errands in the city. I even met him a couple of times. Maybe it was just my insecurities, but I never liked him much. We men also know when another guy is up to something with our GF.
One day, like a year ago, I got home and she was out, doing something work related. I sat on our computer to do some work, and realized she had been using it herself, and left her Messenger open. We both have each other passwords on our cell phones, so it is not like I feel I need to spy or anything, but this day, something caught my eye: It was a conversation with A. A very long one. I felt terrible about reading something that was supposed to be private, but could not help myself and went on reading it. The guy was keeping the conversation on the hot side, and was also all about how beautiful she was, and how much he'd always felt for her, and how she made him hot, and called her my love, etc. It really pissed me off, especially because even though she was not encouraging him, she was not discouraging either. Her replies were only smiling and  blushed emojis, and giggly answers like ""Stop it.."" or ""You're terrible"" and things like that. It seemed to me that she was also enjoying being the focus of attention of A.
I left the conversation right were it was and closed the computer. Never mentioned anything, to her or to anybody. I think I convinced myself that some women may enjoy feeling beautiful and sexy, even desired by other men, and even though it seemed somewhat disrespectful to our relationship, I ended up just putting it aside.
And now the story:
We live in a small village, away from major shops and stores, so, when we have to go to the city, we take advantage and run lots of errands, often staying at a hotel or rental house for a day or two.
That time a few months ago, I was out on a work trip, and we both needed to do a lot of things in the city, so we rented an apartment for a couple of nights, and agreed she will arrive a day early with the car, do her shopping and then I will get to the place we rented the next day. She casually mentioned she was going to meet with A, and have lunch together on the day she was by herself. I wasn't quite happy with the idea, but did not oppose. Not that they haven't shared time together before. Besides, I will not be the one stopping my future wife from doing the things she loves or seeing the persons she cares for. Right? I even texted her during the night after she arrived to the apartment to see how shw was doing and asked her how the lunch went, and she said it was fine.
Anyway, I showed up next day, super tired but very much looking forward to see her. We started chatting about her day and her shopping, and turned out she pretty much didn't do any, so we had extra shopping to do together, which was odd but fine. 
I went to fix us some lunch and noticed an empty bottle of wine in the kitchen. I started joking saying that she sure had a fun night, and she slipped out that she and A had drank it all last night. That was not what she had told me, so I said: ""Oh, I didn't know he was here with you last night, I thought you guys were going to grab lunch someplace"".
I think she realized she had been caught, and she quickly said they had changed the plans because she was tired and thought perhaps it was better to just hang out in the house for a while, so he came over for dinner and brought a bottle of wine and they talked for a few hours. I honestly didn't like the idea of my fiance spending an evening alone with A in this house, but I prentended to be cool with it and just said:  ""I see, oh, it's OK"".
But then the interesting part. She suddenly started acting like super loving and extra sweet and touchy, and started giving me lots of explanations I was not asking for, and went on and on and on about how I knew she would never do anything that will risk our relationship and how much she loved me. It was just so much effort she put on that. It sounded just plain strange.
I did not ask her anything more. I didn't want to look like a jealous guy, and I also know she would stick to her story... Part of me wanted to find out more, especially because she is quite jealous about me meeting with my very few female friends from years ago. But on the other hand, I was also scared to know more.
My fiance and A became estranged after that day. I know they don't chat as often, and have not seen each other since that day. That also seems odd.
So... many months later, and with the wedding around the corner, I can't quite get this thing out of my head.
AITA for suspecting her?... Do you think something happened that night? Furthermore, do I want to know?...",3,1732567072.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False
1gzt65g,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gzt65g/am_i_crazy_to_pass_up_a_140k_fully_remote_job_in/,"Am I crazy to pass up a $140k fully remote job in my current field to pivot into industrial real estate? It would mean joining my best friend's brokerage team, working for little to no pay for 1-2 years, but with the potential for higher income and greater freedom down the road.","**Ok so I'm 29, with no kids, wife or mortgage wondering if I should shake things up... I have $50k in savings, $40k in retirement.**

Basically, **I've been in corporate analytics for 7 years now**. For the last 4 years, I've been fully remote and earning $100-120k total comp. This job was never something I really set out to do, but just kind of found myself in and kept going. The type of job where you sit in front of a screen all day, every day. My new boss sucks now and I need to get out ASAP , so I've been interviewing and weighing my options. However, **even when I had a great boss, I always found myself bored, unmotivated, and feeling like I was capable of more than being behind a screen all day. I also just can't stand the corporate atmosphere anymore.** It's not me at all. I'll save my rant on that for another post.

Long story short - my best friend I've known my entire life has been an **industrial real estate broker** for as long as I've been in my career and he absolutely loves it. Opposite of corporate atmosphere too, very entrepreneurial with freedom once you get established. After I vented to him about my situation, he told me to consider joining his team and learning the industry. Loves his boss, introduced us, **boss gave me the green light to join their team** if I choose to after we had a coffee chat. This **boss is a lifelong industry veteran who has earned over $30M in career commissions, and is looking for someone to help my friend for when he passes off his book of business and retires in 3-4 years**. My friend earns $150-250k a year now, but it took him (and everyone else in the industry I've talked to) about 3 years to break $100k which is where I'm at now. Would make only $0-50k the first 2 years most likely, living on a $40-50k draw (loaned salary you pay back). **Everything sounds great except that initial pay cut.** Industry is super interesting to me, working with best friend, super successful boss as a mentor who is also a nice guy, and a less corporate atmosphere where I can make my own schedule.

To make things more complicated, **I just got word that I should be receiving an offer for a job I've been interviewing for on the side, to stay fully remote but do exactly what I do now at a competitor for 20k more ($140k total)**. The guy who would be my boss there seems cool too, but the thought of continuing to settle for the same thing I haven't loved, and be complacent in return for comfort makes me a little sad.

Overall - my gut is telling me to turn down the job offer for what I do now, and take the leap into something that actually excites/motivates me. The long term seems more rewarding in industrial real estate because of the unlimited pay potential, autonomy, and ability to learn from someone great before they retire. I'm thankful for the years I've had in comfort, but I'm ready for more growth outside my comfort zone. The first few years will suck, but it seems worth it if I can stick it through.

**Am I crazy for leaning this way?** I do feel like I just reached a level of financial stability where I can start to live good, settle down with a girl soon and buy a house. However, I feel like I'll always think ""what-if"" and I've always felt capable of more than what I do now.

https://preview.redd.it/tr0hvtczy33e1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=4860f1ce4e9ea8f83c9b31dfc1415125ad6ef30e

The world of hospitality is changing, and it‚Äôs changing fast. With the rise of short-term rentals, the way we travel, the places we stay, and the experiences we seek are evolving. Gone are the days when hotels were the default option for every trip. Today, vacation rentals are taking over, creating a significant impact on traditional hospitality as we know it. But what‚Äôs fueling this shift, and how is it reshaping the travel landscape? Let‚Äôs dive into how short-term rentals are impacting traditional hospitality and why this change is about more than just accommodation options.

Want to learn more about Llivo's vision in reshaping the travel industry? Check out the¬†[Story of Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/p/story-of-llivo)¬†to discover how we‚Äôre creating a community-focused travel experience that truly connects people.

# 1. Redefining Guest Expectations

Travelers today are no longer content with just a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. They want to¬†*feel at home*, wherever they go. They crave personalized experiences that allow them to connect with a destination in an authentic way. Short-term rentals are meeting that demand head-on by offering a range of properties that cater to different tastes‚Äîfrom cozy apartments in the city center to rustic cabins in the mountains.

According to a 2024 report by Skift, 60% of travelers said they prefer vacation rentals over hotels because they offer a more personalized, immersive experience. Hotels, once the epitome of luxury and comfort, are now struggling to keep up with travelers' expectations for individuality and uniqueness.

At Llivo, we encourage our hosts to provide more than just a stay‚Äîwe encourage them to create experiences that speak to the heart of their guests. Imagine waking up in a sunlit room, with your host‚Äôs tips on the best local coffee spots waiting on the kitchen counter. It‚Äôs these human touches that are winning over travelers today.

To get started on your journey towards becoming an exceptional host, visit our¬†[Create Standout Listing](https://www.llivo.com/p/create-standout-listing)¬†page for insights on how to elevate your hosting game.

# 2. The Push for Unique Accommodation Options

*Variety is the spice of life*, and when it comes to accommodation, travelers want variety. Short-term rentals offer exactly that: the freedom to choose from a wide range of properties. Want to stay in a beachfront villa, a treehouse, or a quirky downtown loft? It‚Äôs all possible, and this flexibility is hard for traditional hotels to replicate. Hotels offer uniformity, which can be comforting, but it often lacks the uniqueness that many travelers seek.

Platforms like Llivo give hosts the ability to offer truly unique properties that cater to different needs and desires, creating an experience that‚Äôs memorable and one-of-a-kind. For travelers looking for something beyond cookie-cutter hotel rooms, short-term rentals are the clear choice.

Learn more about how Llivo is enabling hosts to provide diverse and unique accommodation options on our¬†[Guide to Listing](https://www.llivo.com/p/guide-to-listing)¬†page.

# 3. Cost and Value‚ÄîThe Transparency Factor

When it comes to cost, \*transparency matters. Traditional hotels often have hidden fees that can quickly add up: resort fees, parking charges, expensive room service‚Äîit‚Äôs all extra. Short-term rentals, by contrast, often provide \**cost transparency*¬†and value that‚Äôs unmatched, especially for groups and families. Having a full kitchen, multiple bedrooms, and living space makes vacation rentals an economical choice, giving travelers the ability to save on meals and enjoy their stay on their own terms.

A 2024 study by AirDNA highlighted that¬†*65% of vacation rental guests*¬†found their stay to be more affordable compared to hotels, particularly when traveling in groups. Llivo takes this transparency even further by offering a clear 12% service fee without any surprise add-ons, allowing guests to travel with peace of mind, knowing exactly what they‚Äôre paying for.

To explore how Llivo ensures transparency in pricing and helps guests make informed choices, visit our¬†[Boost Listing](https://www.llivo.com/p/boost-listing)¬†page.

# 4. The Shift Toward Hybrid Travel

The rise of¬†*remote work*¬†has reshaped travel in unimaginable ways. Hybrid travel‚Äîcombining business and leisure‚Äîhas become a dominant trend, and short-term rentals are at the heart of it. Hotels can be impersonal and rigid, whereas vacation rentals provide the amenities that make long-term stays and remote work both productive and enjoyable.

Imagine a host setting up a dedicated workspace in their rental or recommending the best co-working cafes nearby. Llivo supports hybrid travelers by ensuring hosts understand what remote workers need: reliable internet, peaceful surroundings, and inspiring environments. These are things that not only make a trip enjoyable but also make productivity easier to achieve.

# 5. Revenue Implications for Hotels

*Traditional hotels are feeling the pinch*. With the rise of short-term rentals, many hotels are finding it challenging to compete on price, uniqueness, and the personalized service offered by hosts. As a result, some hotels are experimenting with new concepts, such as apartment-style rooms or extended-stay offers. Yet, they face structural limitations‚Äîhotels are built to be hotels, and adapting to the short-term rental model isn‚Äôt always feasible.

Hosts on Llivo have flexibility that hotels can‚Äôt match. They can set dynamic pricing, offer discounts for extended stays, and adjust their offerings to meet traveler preferences‚Äîall while maintaining a personal touch. This adaptability is why short-term rentals continue to thrive, even as hotels scramble to evolve.

# 6. Health and Safety‚ÄîA New Priority

In a post-pandemic world,¬†*health and safety*¬†have taken center stage. Travelers are now hyper-aware of cleanliness standards, preferring private accommodations that minimize contact with strangers. Short-term rentals offer this safety advantage by providing entire homes or apartments, reducing the need for shared spaces like lobbies and elevators.

Llivo works with hosts to ensure strict adherence to health protocols, making sure that guests feel comfortable and safe. Additionally, by partnering with¬†*Stripe*¬†for secure transactions, Llivo provides a secure and smooth booking process, which adds another layer of confidence for guests choosing to book through our platform.

# 7. Building Emotional Connections

One of the most significant impacts of short-term rentals is the ability to¬†*foster emotional connections*. When travelers stay in a vacation rental, they often interact directly with the host‚Äîsomeone who knows the city inside and out, who can share hidden gems that only locals know about. This kind of connection isn‚Äôt possible in a traditional hotel setting, where interactions are typically limited to a polite front-desk exchange.

Imagine arriving at your vacation rental and finding a handwritten note from your host, welcoming you and suggesting a neighborhood bakery that makes the best fresh croissants. It‚Äôs these small yet meaningful gestures that turn a vacation into an unforgettable experience, and that‚Äôs the vision Llivo strives to realize for every guest.

# Final Words

Short-term rentals are reshaping the traditional hospitality landscape, offering more than just a place to sleep. They‚Äôre providing travelers with meaningful connections, unique experiences, flexibility, and value that hotels often struggle to match. Platforms like Llivo are at the forefront of this movement, redefining what it means to travel and creating opportunities for both guests and hosts to connect in new and impactful ways.

Interested in being part of this evolution? Whether you‚Äôre a traveler seeking more than a standard stay, or a host ready to provide incredible experiences, Llivo is your platform.

I‚Äôve been selling online for decades. Used to be Craigslist, have been using Marketplace exclusively for over a decade. I always bring buyers to my home for a few reasons:

1. People are flaky af, they don‚Äôt show up on time or at all, and I‚Äôm not going to be sitting in a parking lot somewhere waiting around. 

2. My home is secure in a high end neighborhood and covered with cameras, so I feel much safer here. 

3. It‚Äôs simply more convenient for me. 

I‚Äôve never had an issue with home sales. Never been robbed or threatened or scared. 

My girl just today after 5 years living here with me has decided she‚Äôs scared and doesn‚Äôt want strangers coming to our home. Thinks we should meet at a local coffee shop or something. Nothing has happened to prompt this other than I listed an item today and, as is typical, the person who said he was going to come get it no showed. 

She says ‚Äúnow he has our address.‚Äù So? Our address is publicly available same as everyone. People flake and no show all the time, it‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt try to meet people in public. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to rob us.

I can feel you in the distance, maybe lost, uncertain, doubting that we‚Äôll ever cross paths. Like me, maybe you think Reddit isn‚Äôt the most romantic place to meet a soulmate, but here we are, trying our luck and hoping for the best. Maybe you‚Äôve posted here before, and I saw it, felt a spark, but nerves held me back. I‚Äôm still looking though, I have my fingers and everything else crossed that we‚Äôll come across each other one day.

I‚Äôm looking for my Morticia, someone passionate, daring, and as smitten as I am. I want that electric connection that makes the world think we‚Äôre crazy, when really, it‚Äôs just us, living in our little bubble of love and laughter. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm adventurous and unapologetically cheeky and hoping my soulmate shares my mischievous side, in and out of the bedroom. Maybe we‚Äôre more similar? Mind like a sewer? Bedroom drawer full of toys? Shopping wish lists full of potential fun and shenanigans? TMI? Possibly‚Ä¶ but why hide who I am, why not be myself and hopefully find my perfect match along the way.

I‚Äôm 28, based in the West Midlands (UK), and work full-time in the NHS which allows me to pay bills and my OF subscriptions (I‚Äôm not actually subscribed but I could be convinced‚Ä¶ maybe). I‚Äôm financially secure with a house and car, no strings or debts. I‚Äôve got a cuddly dad bod (which I‚Äôm working on), blue eyes, short brown hair and an occasional beard.

Personality wise, I‚Äôm a mix of rational and whimsical, ambitious and relaxed, logical and romantic. Call me an INTJ-T Aquarius who‚Äôs somehow both calm and mischievous. I‚Äôm an ambivert who loves cooking, baking, storytelling, and diving into Marvel, Doctor Who, or random YouTube rabbit holes. I like walks, board games, video games (Minecraft, Fallout, Assassin‚Äôs Creed), and music like Imagine Dragons or Lewis Capaldi. My sense of humour is a mix of dad jokes, innuendos, and sarcasm, I hope to find someone who can match me.

Food wise, I‚Äôm a sucker for roast dinners, pasta, and pizza, just keep the onions and olives far away, and we‚Äôre golden. For drinks I like Tea and hot chocolate, coffee and alcohol, not so much. I‚Äôm open to trying new things and finding joy in the little quirks.

I can be anxious, spacey, and mischievous, but I‚Äôm also caring, resourceful, and romantic. I dream of companionship, curiosity, and building a future, hopefully with my soulmate. That future, for me, includes a life partner I can commit to fully, and children someday. I don‚Äôt have pets right now, but I love dogs and am open to other animals.

I'm 7 months pregnant with our daughter, and have always been interested in pagan Mythology, specifically from Mesopotamia. 

I've always wanted to name our child after a mythological god or goddess, and eventually settled on Ishtar, the goddess of love and war.

My husband was not super involved in choosing a name, he had been preparing our daughter's nursery, so I assumed it was my job to choose her a name. 

Yesterday I decided to tell him which name I picked as he was eating breakfast for work, and was super excited to do so!

My husband was absolutely shocked at the name, and I had assumed it was because he loved the name so much.

I explained why I chose the name Ishtar, and how it was a beautiful and strong symbolic name for our little girl.

He started mumbling, and I asked if he was ok; and then he suddenly yelled ""*my daughter will NOT BE A BOT!*""

He started to go on a rant like he was Charlie Kelly, and kept talking about bots, and then I realized he was talking about this game, Eve.

So I assured him that the name Ishtar had absolutely nothing to do with Eve, and that no one would think our daughter is a bot, but then he suddenly fell on the floor, and this was when I noted the scalding hot coffee and bits of cup in his feet...

Honestly he was being dramatic, but I finally caved in and told him that we could choose my second choice for a name, and called an ambulance to treat his wounds.

He was placed on a stretcher by paramedics, and then he asked me ""*What was the second choice for the name?,""* so I told him ""*Phoebe*""

He started screaming this animalistic deep guttural scream, so loudly that the neighbors were concerned and rushed out to check what was wrong. I accompanied him to the hospital, and they gave him some medicine to help him fall asleep.

I'm still in the hospital, in his room. He's sleeping at this moment. What did I do wrong?",13,1732566545.0,Eve,11,0.78,False

Hi! 3 weeks ago I accidentally spilled my coffee on my laptop and I took it to the service the same day. They opened it, cleaned it and changed my thermal tape cuz it was needed. They said everything is okay. However, ever since I got it there‚Äôs been a really weird static/sparking sound coming from its back. I noticed it‚Äôs mostly coming from the left side. Whenever my laptop is working more the sound is getting worse and it‚Äôs the worst when I turn the laptop different ways. It sounds awful. 

The thing is that ever since I got my laptop back everything is okay and is even working better bc it‚Äôs not getting overheated. Except for this sparking sound obviously. 

I have no idea if it‚Äôs static energy or if there are maybe some loosen parts left and the service kind of f*uck*d up. Still I‚Äôm going to a different service soon to get it checked but I just wanted to know beforehand.

Hey there. Ideally seeking someone to connect with on the physical and mental level. Would prefer ongoing if all goes well. This isn't something I've ever done but suffering from seasonal depression along with working second shift kind of makes the lack of intimacy even worse. I'm very laid back and friendly and would hope you are as well. More introverted but great with people one on one. Love coffee, anything outdoors, cuddling, reading and sex when it's with the right person. I don't smoke or drink and take good care of myself. I'm open to any race or body style as well as age. I'm 5'10"", green eyes, brown hair and more athletic myself and also caucasian if that matters to you.

After receiving an invitation to the wedding of my ex-boyfriend and my mom, I was shocked. If you don‚Äôt know what I am talking about, make sure to watch my last video (or read my previous post) about how I found out in the most crazy way that my then-boyfriend cheated on me with my mom, and I found them having sex in my hot tub. My father, sister, and I didn‚Äôt really know how to react to it. For the past few weeks, we talked about it almost every day. My father made his decision very clear; he wants nothing to do with it because it is the most crazy thing that could ever happen to him, and he will never forgive my mom for what she has done to all of us, which I get, but for me, she is still my mom‚Ä¶ She gave birth to me and my sister, and she will always be our mom. It is really hard to think about everything that happened, but I will have to move on.

My sister and I talked it through: should we go to the wedding or not? Should we maybe contact her before the wedding and see how it is going and if she knows what she has caused? We would really like our mom back. The crazy thing is that my ex-boyfriend, who is two years older than me, will be my stepdad‚Äîcrazy!

We talked it through and decided that we were going to call her and ask if she had time so we could come over and talk to her about everything. We wanted to call her, but we had already received a call from her. We picked up the phone, and it was my ex-boyfriend, or soon-to-be stepdad, on the line. He wanted to talk to me alone before talking to my little sister. I went into my bedroom and said that he could talk.

He first apologized for how everything had happened and said he was sorry that he fell in love with my mom. He did not want it to go like this, and he is still very much in love with me and has a hard time getting me out of his head. I actually started yelling and crying; hearing that made me furious. I told him it was very confusing and that he had ruined two families, and how he could do such a thing. He said that my mom was even hotter than I was and that she deserved more than my boring, ugly dad. I hung up the phone. I love my dad; how could someone say that?

A few days passed, and my sister and I decided to call my mom, and again my ex-boyfriend picked up. I asked him if he could pass the phone to my mom because we wanted to talk to her. He passed her the phone and said hello. My sister immediately started crying and said she missed her. My mom didn‚Äôt react like we thought she would; she said, ‚ÄúOh god, don‚Äôt be such a baby,‚Äù which did stop my sister from crying but not from shock. We asked her if she wanted to talk in person and where she was staying at the moment so we could visit her, or go somewhere in the area to get some coffee and talk. She said she was in Europe, so visiting would be kind of hard. We asked her when she was going to come back, but she did not know if she would be back in the US very soon. We asked if she would come back for us so we could talk this through because we want our mom back. She said she couldn‚Äôt but that we would talk soon and hung up the phone. It was really hard for my sister and me to feel unloved by her and that she had changed so much.

A few weeks passed, and the doorbell rang. I went to open the door, and it was my mom and my ex, and they asked if they could come in. My dad wasn‚Äôt home at the moment, so I let them in. They sat down on the couch, and our mom asked both of us to be her maids of honor. We were actually speechless because we hadn‚Äôt talked in weeks about the whole situation. We looked at each other, and I grabbed my mom‚Äôs hand and said, ‚ÄúCould we maybe talk first before saying yes or no?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúYes, but we have to make it quick. I want to be gone before your dad gets home.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said.

I first asked them to tell their side of the story because we didn‚Äôt know where to start. They said that when they picked us up from the airport that day, it was love at first sight, and that it was never the intention to steal my boyfriend. ‚ÄúI couldn't help it,‚Äù she said; ‚Äúevery time I saw him, my knees got weak, and I wanted to get on top of him.‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúWow, too much information, but thanks for being honest.‚Äù It was the same for him he said. ‚ÄúHe wants to have a family with her and have sex all the time because it was so passionate and romantic but also very crazy.‚Äù I asked out of anger if it was worth it to be homewreckers. They stayed calm and said that love comes first, and she said she hadn't been in love with my dad for years, but she could not be alone. She asked for our forgiveness and came back to the question of whether we wanted to be her maids of honor when she marries my ex. We said we would not be her maids of honor, but we would attend the wedding if that was okay with her because we want our mom back. She said it was okay and that she loves us.

A few months went by, and today was the day of the wedding. My sister and I had the most beautiful dresses, so we went by my dad's new place to show him and his new girlfriend, and to ask if he was okay because he was with my mom almost his entire life. He started to cry when we walked through the door and said we looked absolutely stunning. We asked if he was okay, and he said that he has two amazing daughters and a new girlfriend, and that he was going to be okay. We hugged him very tightly and jumped in the car to my mom's wedding.

Once we arrived, we went to the back room of the church to be with our mom and help her with the last touches. She looked absolutely stunning, but she had not finished her makeup yet, so we helped her. I cleaned up the room a little, and my little sister, who is amazing with makeup, helped her with eyeshadow and all those things I have no idea about. A little later, my ex-mother-in-law came in to bring her the bridal bouquet and a cup of tea. It was really weird seeing my ex-mother-in-law become my mom's mother-in-law; how crazy is that? We talked a little, and as I could feel and hear, she was not completely agreeing with all of it, but she has to support her son because she loves him so much, and he is her only son. I could understand that because that is what we do for our mom.

Once her makeup was done, we put some pins in her hair, and she was all ready and absolutely stunning. Now we were just waiting for her soon-to-be husband to get ready and get to the church. The wedding was supposed to start at 3 PM, and it was already 2:30 PM, but she couldn‚Äôt get in touch with him. She said he was probably on his way to the church right now and wasn‚Äôt looking at his phone. As minutes passed, she started to get worried. She had tried to call him and text him, but he didn‚Äôt answer. She walked to her future mother-in-law and asked if she could try and reach him, but there was no luck.

It was now five minutes before the service was supposed to start. Family and friends were all entering the church, but we were still waiting for the groom. In the distance, we heard police and ambulance sirens, but we did not think anything of it at first. Minutes passed, and it was now half an hour later. Police entered the church, looking for my mom and future parents-in-law, who were waiting with my mom. The police entered the back room and said, ‚ÄúHello, miss, unfortunately we have to tell you that there has been an accident, and your fianc√© has been shot in the head and died on the scene.‚Äù

My mom got on her knees and started crying and screaming; so did his parents. It was awful to see. I was too shocked to speak. How could this have happened? Who would do such a thing to him? A few minutes later, the police got a message, and they walked up to me, grabbed my arms, and said, ‚ÄúWe have a warrant to arrest you for the murder of your mom‚Äôs fianc√©. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney; if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.

Advice please!,"So I'm very recently engaged, and through a great act of serendipity we already have a date and venue for next October, huzzah! I'm already excited about planning and thinking about how to ask my besties to be my Best People, and could use suggestions on a meaningful gift or token to give with my ask.

The wedding is going to be a solid big party, but also fairly non-traditional. I think we're each only going to have 2-person bridal parties, both of mixed gender. I want to ask my best girl and guy friends to stand with me, and I've been in both of their weddings. I was a bridesmaid in my girlfriend's wedding about a million years ago (now godmother to her kids), and I was 'Best Person' for my guy friend when he got married 3 years ago (and enjoyed making a year and a half of Best Man jokes about myself a little too much üòÜ). We never quite landed on pleasing vocabulary, but it was very meaningful.

When my guy friend asked me to be his best.. person, lol, he did it very sweetly by asking me in person and giving a really cool customized gift, a drinking horn engraved with my name and ""Best Person 2021."" I'd really love to come up with something like that I can give to each of them when I formally ask them, which I'd like to do when I get to see each one in person (separately) around the holidays. Anything distinctly gendered doesn't work with this combo, and something super generic like a coffee mug is lame. And they're quite different people and while I'm close to both, they don't know each other well, so there's no obvious ""us"" thing. I guess they don't necessarily need to be the same item with only 2 people, so there's that. But I'd really love to gift something that's kind of special, kind of quirky, but also not completely useless.

Any suggestions that can be customized or engraved or something, that would feel right for the kind of people who think a personalized drinking horn is pretty ideal!? ",0,1732565983.0,weddingplanning,3,0.25,False

1gzspls,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1gzspls/west_end_retirement_homes_offering_memory_care/,"West end retirement homes offering memory care, but who also do a good job of supporting earlier stages of dementia","I feel like I‚Äôve toured just about every retirement home in the west end, and it feels like there‚Äôs a giant gap in care for residents with dementia. Or just a glaring conflict of interest? I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has some inside knowledge to share. 

I‚Äôm looking for something specific in retirement homes (not long term care at this stage) anywhere west of about Carlington/Westboro area, north of about Hunt Club (preferably north of Baseline). Kanata/Stittsville would be considered too (I‚Äôm supporting from Arnprior and need it to be easily accessible from there). Preferably somewhere that‚Äôs not so profit driven that they‚Äôre going to gouge residents for every tiny thing. 

Here‚Äôs my situation. My mom has Alzheimer‚Äôs, relatively early stages, but is starting to shift from simple memory loss to some distinct dementia behaviours and delusions. She still does her own laundry, makes her own bed, doesn‚Äôt need help with bathing/dressing, goes down for meals on her own, joins some activities, plays cards, walks over to the shops across the street to meet friends for coffee or buy odds and ends. But‚Ä¶ she also spends too much time sitting alone in her room feeling sad and lonely and anxious. She‚Äôs anxious all the time, doesn‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs there. Forgets that my dad died 13 years ago, so thinks he‚Äôs abandoned her. Forgets that she sold her house 8 months ago. Thinks people are stealing from her, hacking her phone, trying to get her money/house. Any time she can‚Äôt reach her daughters immediately she thinks something horrible has happened to us and often calls the police, etc. She‚Äôs super paranoid about health care, is resistant to care if not handled properly, and adamantly refuses any treatment/medication for mental health. 

Places that don‚Äôt offer memory care are pretty good at trying to support someone at this stage, because of course they want to keep you as long as possible. My Moms in one of these places now. But their staff aren‚Äôt really trained in handling the paranoia/anxiety/agitation/etc of people with dementia, since they don‚Äôt offer memory care. So incidents happen which could have easily been avoided. 

We‚Äôd like to move my mom somewhere where she can age in place, and not have to move later when she‚Äôs further along and exit seeking becomes a problem, for example. But when I talk to any of the places that offer memory care, it seems that if residents need any extra emotional support for their dementia, the only way they can get it is to move to the locked dementia floor and pay $8-10k/month for a bunch of services they don‚Äôt need, a total loss of personal freedom, and to be locked up with people who are much further along than they are, with activities dumbed down to match. That‚Äôs like, the worst thing in the world to do to someone with early stages of dementia. They will hate it and they will decline faster. But if you move in to one of their more independent floors, they basically tell you you‚Äôre on your own. There are no staff around and residents pretty much have to fend for themselves. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs zero effort to support this middle stage between complete independence and complete dependence. They want to protect themselves from liability as soon as there‚Äôs even a possibility of exit seeking somewhere in the future, and they want to push you into the highest possible price bracket (even if it‚Äôs for services you don‚Äôt need, and an environment that will actually be detrimental to your loved one‚Äôs rate of decline), by offering zero support on the more independent floors. 

So my question is, does anyone know of any retirement homes in the west end who do in fact offer a secure floor and good dementia care for later stages, but who *also* have dementia trained staff and some more emotional/social support available on their more independent floors? My mom‚Äôs doctor tells me assisted living is supposed to fill this space, but everywhere I‚Äôve toured, assisted living has been for people who need physical assistance with activities of daily living, which my mom doesn‚Äôt. They make a point to explain why this isn‚Äôt the right option for someone with dementia. So what‚Äôs the answer?",3,1732565934.0,ottawa,2,1.0,False

1gzsoz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThomasDowntheMine1983/comments/1gzsoz7/the_following_is_a_letter_from_tim_staffell_a/,"The following is a letter from Tim Staffell, a model maker from Thomas the Tank Engine, in response to his involvement with the Down the Mine pilot from 1983.
","In response to your inquiry regarding Tommy The Tank pilot. It‚Äôs worth bearing in mind a couple of things:

1. ¬† ¬† 	My memory is not that great after forty years

2. ¬† ¬† 	In spite of what Bob Gauld-Galliers (Art Director) suggests, it‚Äôs very unlikely that a print survived to the present day, and I‚Äôm not sure that it was ever transferred to tape, though even if it was, magnetic tape deteriorates almost as quickly as 35mm film stock.

3. ¬† ¬† 	It was an exercise in the logistics of shooting a series. A lot of mistakes were made, (noted elsewhere) ‚Äì and much of it remained a ‚Äòwork-in-progress‚Äô even though it was technically complete, as regards a presentation to the production company and the finance people.

¬†

Having said all that, my own recollections of it were pretty much as follows: The commission for the series depended on the pilot demonstrating technical and aesthetic competence. It must be judged a success on that criterion, but it was a difficult thing to film‚Ä¶ The engines were scratch-built (I think Tommy & Gordon), structure and motive power, and mechanical additions such as the eye mechanisms and the original smoke generator, and they behaved very erratically as a result. I recall that on some shots they had to be pulled along with fishing wire because the electric motors were temperamental; It‚Äôs been remarked elsewhere that the Gauge One rails were supplied by a company called tenmille products, (who are still trading -[ Tenmille Products Model Railway](http://www.tenmille.com/)) ‚Äì this is true for the pilot; The models of Annie & Clarabel were based on kits from the same company, with little vac-formed faces added by the Clearwater model team. It‚Äôs said that the rails rusted ‚Äì that‚Äôs not strictly true ‚Äì When we came to shoot the series proper, The Dendritic salt we used for snow corroded the electrical connections to the rails, and we had to replace everything with Marklin stainless steel. ‚Äì the brass rails did prove unreliable in the pilot, connectivity failed often, hence the fishing line.

The level of maintenance on the pilot engines was high. They were equipped with a smoke generator based on a 12V car cigarette lighter, with conventional studio smoke-machine oil dripped on the hot element before each shot ‚Äì but the heat proved to be sufficient to warp the ABS and Perspex of the engine bodies, so they could not be used for any length of time, a swift charging before a shot allowed a rather feeble smoke effect that sometimes emanated from gaps behind the eyes or at the side of the face-plug.. (the cool pumped TiCl4 of the final models solved all that)

I seem to recall that the main driving wheels were cast in metal-filled resin and turned on a lathe, which proved to be another imperfect solution to the required trouble-free mechanics. Rolling stock (such as Annie & Clarabel) came from tenmille products. Assembling a kit from them required a close attention to the geometry of the wheels and chassis; likewise laying down the track; sometimes one wheel would leave the track if the surface wasn‚Äôt level and the truck not accurately laid‚Ä¶ the whole process of building and shooting the pilot threw up pages of mods required to cover the shortcomings that came to light.

The eye mechanisms were improved considerably for the actual series. The space behind the eye in the body had to accommodate two little RC servos and a parallelogram arrangement to allow the eyes to be moved by means of a joystick on the remote control. During the pilot,they snagged repeatedly, smoke came out around them, and they were constantly being modified. Often, the eyes were set and locked in a particular direction. It wasn‚Äôt unheard of for the static from the power coupling on the track to affect the servos and make the eyes suddenly veer wildly off‚Ä¶

All of this, of course, is exactly as it should be‚Ä¶ the pilot episode solved most, if not all of the problems involved in shooting the series; Fortunately it was good enough to satisfy the money men, and we were funded for the series.

And in those early months we were under contract not to talk about it, or take pictures or remove anything from the set while the approval for the finance was sought. Consequently there are very few pictures of that time, and I certainly didn‚Äôt take any. It‚Äôs pretty standard practice for a commercial endeavour like that ‚Äì It‚Äôs worse today ‚Äì if you‚Äôre at Pinewood Studios and you take a picture of an Imperial Stormtrooper having a coffee during a break from Star Wars ‚Äì better not let anyone know you‚Äôve taken it! So I‚Äôm sorry to say I have no memorabilia of any sort from the show.

The fact that Down The Mine was reshot later is the best indicator of exactly how sub-standard the pilot actually turned out. If Bob Gauld-Galliers is right, and a serviceable print turns up at some point, it will be interesting to see where the failures are most noticeable.

I hope that this isn‚Äôt too disappointing as regards content. It really does represent the total of my fading memory of those days.

However, I‚Äôm sure you will be able to create a worthy project on the subject, and I wish you the very best.

Thanks for inquiring; Keep safe during these strange times

All the best

Tim Staffell

Now, on to my day. I hope you enjoy the read and acquire a little wisdom to boot! 

I was stretched out relaxing, in a nice post-coitus glow, as my bed mate busily braided my pubic hair. He is a young dandy immigrant from Thailand I met at the airport. I decided to take him into my employ as a housekeeper. I still am not quite sure of his name. But he is nubile and loyal. He has strict instructions to clean my private area of debris immediately after any sort of tryst in which I engage. Then he developed this oh so odd habit of braiding my hair down there. Frankly, I think it makes his job more difficult. But what do I know? I am not Asian. LOL! 

Anyway, let‚Äôs move forward and get to the point of this story, shall we? After I managed to pry my housekeeper off my loins, I put him up in his box and started getting on with my day. See, this was merely my morning encounter; perhaps the first of many for the day. 

The first thing I did was to initiate my self-cleaning regime. After such an encounter I must first wash my hands with soap and hot water exactly 4 times in order to remove the sin from my skin. Being that this is the pre-shower phase of my morning, I was still wearing my nighttime watch, a gorgeous IWC diver I picked up on a skin cruise in the Caribbean back in the spring. 

I am very careful to remove my timepiece PRIOR to washing my hands. It is not the water I fear, for I thoroughly trust the exquisite horological mastery that comes with Swiss watchmaking. Rather, it is the relatively radical movement with my wrists and hands that I fear. What I mean is that while there is nothing unusual with hand washing, the rapid back and forth, up and down, motions associated with this procedure (necessitated by it, even), is more stress than I am comfortable voluntarily subjecting the delicate mechanical movement to. Now obviously this will not itself damage the movement or cause excessive wear hastening a servicing. But, over time as you wash your hands during the course of my regimented 27 incremental daily washings, at 4 consecutive washings each, the accrued abnormal movement over, say, one year will become a factor in both timekeeping precision and wear. Therefore, I find that the best practice is to remove my watch prior to each hand cleaning.

Thereafter, I shower, preen, and primp. It usually takes me 2 hours minimum to complete both this and getting dressed for the day. Some days it may take longer depending on whether I need my Thai housekeeper to administer an enema to me (twice weekly, minimum, for wellness). 

Once ready for the day I leave my home, usually by 10:30 am. The first order of business is to have my chauffeur deliver me to my favorite cafe where I shall sip espresso for an hour as I peruse the latest news of the day (Hodinkee, WatchSeeker, Chrono24, etc‚Ä¶). By the time I am finished, the French pastry chef, Fr√©d√©rique, usually goes on break and joins me at my table for a chat. We have a right jaunty repartee over a variety of topics. Fr√©d√©rique is married to a morbidly obese Greek lass with 2 young children. But little do they know that he doubles as a trans lady nightclub singer at a seedy little dive bar on the south side of town called ‚ÄúThe Busted Cherry‚Äù. But I digress. 

After coffee I visit my favorite cigar lounge, called ‚ÄúSuck This!‚Äù. I love the Uber-masculine ambiance there!! I usually suck on a large Cuban for an hour or so as I sip Cabernet and gossip with the ‚Äúkept‚Äù men who are passing time as their wealthy significant others are toiling away in the salt mines. We all wear very nice and very expensive watches on our wrists (and other places‚Ä¶wink,wink!). We like to take group wrist shots and post them to the internet to memorialize our taste and sophistication. 

Now, let me be clear here. Most of these men at the cigar lounge are heterosexual men. But it rarely takes much coaxing to have them produce their cocks. In fact, for a time we practiced ‚ÄúDicks Out Monday‚Äù at the lounge where we all were required to have our member out and on full display as we smoked cigars. As luck would have it, eventually someone would get hard, then one thing would lead to another and ‚Ä¶ But Hans, the owner, was forced to put a stop to this after a Bible thumper wandered in one day for a cigar and found us all in mid-coitus engaging in an orgy. Hans had to pay a large fine imposed by the city for ‚Äúindecent conduct‚Äù and a whole lot of other trumped up charges. So now we have to keep our cocks holstered when on the premises. Of course, this does not mean that we cannot explore our prurient interests together. We just have to take it off the premises. There‚Äôs a men‚Äôs room in the Arby‚Äôs next door that has seen a LOT of action! 

By now it‚Äôs at least 2:00 pm and I am ready to go to work. This is where the rubber hits the dick, my friends! I have several ADs of several luxury watch brands I work with throughout the city. They know I am a flipper. But they do not care. I provide kickbacks and sexual favors, not to mention my  extortion racket. I have all of the ADs and their staffs under my thumb. Get out of line with me and maybe the Handy-Js stop happening. Or maybe your wife anonymously receives a photograph with my dick in your mouth. Plus, most of the sales reps cannot make ends meet without the 10% kickbacks I give them. The managers like this because it means they do not need to pay the sales reps as much to keep them there. See, it all works out for everybody. Nobody is hurt. Rolex and others get a steady stream of distribution of product, then we all get a cut. 

In order to perpetuate this system there must be a gray market accommodating prices way above retail. In order to have this opportunity the ADs keep up their bullshit about limited supply. They put you on a non-existent waitlist and then forget about you. They treat prospective purchasers like shit to encourage them to go gray and pay more. 

Let‚Äôs be clear here. Each individual luxury watch AD is usually an independently owned company. There are some self-dealing corporate stores out there, but most product is distributed through independently owned ADs. Now, Rolex does not just given them inventory to sell. Nope! The brand or a third party financier provide floor plan financing, like what is used by a car lot taking cars from the manufacturer. The Brand gets paid by the AD for the product upon sale, plus interest. The AD nets the retail price, minus the cost of product (paid to the manufacturer) and overhead. 

In reality, the AD makes relatively very little off each sale. In order to maintain distribution, the brand sometimes has to offer rebates and other bell-and-whistle incentives to the retailer. Yes, the AD nets a decent amount. But just how many watches do they have to sell in order to pay rent and keep their lights on? A lot! These ADs are not located in the hood. They are in high-rent districts. It‚Äôs a business and they have to make ends meet. 

I suspect that the brands know full well what is going on, and APPROVE of it. The floor plan financing assures they get paid. In order to maintain distribution they allow the ADs to profit a little by forcing customers into the gray market so they can get the additional revenue from the kickback. If you have ever run a business then you  know how tight budgets can be. These kickbacks keep many ADs liquid. 

My job as a ‚Äúflipper‚Äù is to facilitate. I am one of the middlemen. I supply the gray market. I take product out of a low-price market and put it into a higher price market, which generates more money off the same product.  I net money, and I take care of those who take care of me. 

Let‚Äôs be clear here. There are unscrupulous individuals out there who practice Enhanced Market Facilitation (which I prefer to ‚ÄúFlipper‚Äù) in secret. They buy retail from the Ad, sell high on the gray market, then pocket the net proceeds. This is tantamount to theft and it hurts the entire system. They fuck the AD. I, instead, take care of my ADs and they help me with product supply. 

Have you ever waited a year for a particular Rolex? Two years? Three years? Then when you finally get the call it is only to offer you a completely different watch that the one you are waiting for? Yes, there are VIPs out there who get priority over you. There are also the AD approved flippers, like myself, who get priority over you. You are essentially a nobody to them. I, on the other hand, will pay them full retail PLUS an additional 10% on the flip. Of course folks in this racket get priority over you. Selling to you is a LOSS for the AD. They are in business to net a profit, not to satisfy some schmucky trust fund kid. LOL!

So that is, in a nutshell, how my day goes. I usually get home around 9:00 pm, unless I am out schmoozing an AD or sales rep (in which case I may be gone all night). On a normal evening after work I arrive home, have a stiff toddy and receive my nightly hummer from my Thai servant. My groundskeeper lets him out of his box at 5:00pm everyday to feed him and let him go outside to do his peeps and poops. My maid, Helga, then gets him bathed so that he is immaculate when I arrive home. 

At this point I know you have something on your mind, to wit: How much do I earn? Well, I like to play it close to the vest on matters of money. Let‚Äôs just say that I‚Äôm comfortable. I will add that I do indulge my desires from time to time. For example, if I have a particularly good month I may splurge on the ‚ÄúGeraldo Experience‚Äù. This is where I pay a handsome sum to a gorgeous man named ‚ÄúGeraldo‚Äù to inject cocaine into my penis and then stomp on my nuts with his booted size 12 foot. 

So that is it. I hope you learned something about this business. More importantly, I hope I have dispelled some of the myths. It‚Äôs nothing personal to you when the AD never returns your phone calls and sells your desired piece out from under you. The truth is that the AD legitimately does not give s shit about you and what you want. I hope this heals any egos out there that have been wounded by an AD. Finally, please do not flip lux watches unless you take care of your AD. Not only is it the morally right thing to do, it will pay dividends to you in the future!

We're pretty sure the condoms weren't broken and I didn't have any precum or anything inside the condoms, but we were cuddling naked and our genitals did rub each other and im afraid that when my tip touched her vulva I might have gotten some pre cum there. I know its unlikely but she is currently 26 days late on her period, she has taken a test 15 days after intercourse which was negative but im worried it being a false negative since she took the test only an hour before her last pee and she drank coffee an hour before the test. 

I'm worried whether she is pregnant or there is a different more serious issue. Also for personal reasons she doesn't really want to take another test to verify.

Just curious about everyone's thoughts on the situation and whether or not I should be worried.",2,1732565631.0,amipregnant,4,1.0,False
1gzskwo,https://i.redd.it/4x0352s4v33e1.png,Tilt table test finally scheduled!,"My symptoms started last December after I had my son. 

I had a holter test done while in the hospital and another one in April/May this year. Then I didn't hear anything from cardiology until August when I saw/met the cardiologist for the FIRST AND ONLY TIME. 

In August I had an EKG done and an ultrasound(?) done on my heart to rule out anything, but she suspected POTS based on symptoms. I have 3 valves with mild regurgitation but they said it's normal. I have cut down on drinking and obviously don't use an ecig. At most 1 or 2 cups of coffee in a day, but symptoms kept persisting. 

I bothered them enough that they finally called today to schedule the tilt table when I sent them my HR from my watch. I'm still extremely annoyed with them because they mentioned again getting pre-approval from insurance but it's been over a month since the first time they mentioned they would call insurance. Picture included and that's pretty much every morning when I get out of bed. 

This process is extremely annoying!

1gzskc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1gzskc8/i_cant_understand_how_ill_ever_get_past_this/,I can't understand how I'll ever get past this ,"Three years ago, my dog was dropped off at the humane society at 13 years old. His family wanted him euthanized, and when the humane society refused because he was healthy besides treatable issues, they simply left him there. After much needed dental work and putting him on some medication to treat his arthritis and joint issues, he was put up for adoption, hoping for a family that would give him love in his retirement years. No one thought he would last much longer, but he was healthy enough to give him a chance. 

The first family that adopted him returned him promptly because he was afraid of their cat, and he wailed bloody murder in the humane society kennels causing stress for other animals, so he was placed in foster care. This is when we met him. 

His first meeting with my other dog was neutral - they didn't seem to enjoy or hate each other, which is apparently a good sign for two male dogs. My husband held him on his lap while I did the paperwork, and we took him home that night, determined to give this dog the best years of his life. 

I felt guilty for the full 30 days afterward, lamenting over whether we'd made a mistake and should return him while we still could. My other dog hated him at first, he was heavily resistant to crate training, he paced anxiously day and night, and he had near constant continence issues - not that he wasn't trained or couldn't hold it, but out of anxiety. That poor dog was going through an unimaginable transition and I felt I had to see it through even if it was hard, that that was the oath I'd made to him in bringing him home. I was ultimately confident that he wasn't doing or experiencing anything that wouldn't get better with the passage of time. 

This dog was also smelly, clumsy, and not very bright, and I say that in the most endearing sense. His nickname became Smelly Stinky, and we loved our Stinky Smelly. He ripped the worst farts you could possibly imagine, bumped into the coffee table so much we had to buy a soft ottoman to save his head, tripped over obstacles, and was easily startled. He also gave the best cuddles, loved to press his forehead into you for warmth, enjoyed sniffing new smells, chowed through every meal and every treat like it was his last, and had the most inquisitive nature. 

We have joked before that he was like Benjamin Button because he de-aged more the longer we had him. Through love and medical care, we helped him heal his ailments. He was more spry a year into him being with us than he was when we got him, a beautiful surprise after we thought we may only get a few months with him. No one thought he had so much life in him. But we believed in him and were determined to do everything in our power to never ever ever give up on him. As long as he was still engaged and interested in living his life, I was still passionate about giving him all the support he needed to do that. Medications, surgeries, exercise, sweaters, traction socks, diapers, food prep, anything he needed I would find a way to give him, if he wanted it. 

Two weeks ago Smelly Stinky hurt himself trying to get up after a fall. I thought his trouble walking over the next few days was a result of him getting hurt, but I know now that it's the other way around - that he had been slowing starting to struggle to walk already, and the fall was the turning point where we noticed something was different. 

It's been a steady and noticeable decline since then. Every day I've observed something specifically worse than the day before. On Monday, I knew for sure this was serious when I noticed his paws starting to knuckle, so I called the vet. They surprised me with how seriously they took that symptom, even telling me I might want to take him to urgent care since they couldn't get him in until Friday. I assured them he's always been a bit creaky, I didn't think he was dying or anything, I just wanted him to be seen. I had hope at that time he would be better by the time Friday rolled around and all the fuss was for nothing and it turned out that yes it actually was just him healing from the fall. 

I was wrong. By the end of the week, I was following him around the house in case he stumbled, I was holding him up so he could go potty outside, I was carrying him through half of our daily walks, I was supporting him so he could eat. And for the first half of the week he didn't mind all that. He was still excited to eat, walk, sniff, and snuggle - he just needed help to do it. But each day he tried less and less, and had less and less energy to enjoy his experiences. 

On Friday morning he stumbled next to me making breakfast and then just stayed put, laying on the floor waiting patiently for his meal to be ready. This is extremely uncharacteristic of him. He was interested in breakfast, but not excited by it, and in that moment I knew that the end was near. 

His caring vet confirmed for me at our appointment that he was experiencing neurological issues. Besides medications to make him more physically comfortable, there was no treatment. He would only get worse from here - slowly losing all mobility and eventually his breathing ability, and based on the rapid decline of the past two weeks, it would probably be soon, and it would likely be miserable. We could try to make him comfortable and medicated so that he didn't suffer through it, but even that that wasn't a guarantee. So, not the miracle cure I had hoped for, to say the least. 

They didn't push me either way, but assured me that it is better to give him a compassionate exit while he is still generally content with life than to wait until he is suffering. That it is better to say goodbye a day too early than a day too late. And I've heard from so many people they regret not doing it sooner. 

I promised a long time ago that as long as he was still engaged and interested in living his life, I was still passionate about giving him all the support he needed to do that, but he had shown me that day that he no longer was interested in fighting. I knew in my heart that the most supportive thing I could do for him at this time was help him go while it was still apathy, not misery. 

We returned that evening and just shy of 16 years of age we said goodbye to our very dear friend. 

It was absolutely fucking devastating, and still is. I don't wonder if I did the right thing. I know, logically, that I did. But emotionally I don't know how to cope with it having been my decision. I don't know how to reconcile that the reason he isn't here is because I chose for him not to be. I don't know how I'll ever get more than about thirty minutes without tears. I don't know how I'll ever not feel his absence. I don't know how that absence will ever not be physically painful. I know time heals. But right now I can't see past the mountain.

He was a wonderful, perfect, feisty little old man. His life was a miracle. And the fact that I got to exist on this planet at the same time as him, and that I got to be even a small part of his life, is one of the best and most heartbreaking things I will ever have the honor of experiencing. 

It's been a few days now and I can't understand how the world is still revolving. My husband has been a huge support and of course the loss has been hard for him but I think my inability to function has been extra taxing. I feel like I'm failing at work. I can't respond to texts and messages. My other dog is probably distressed by my distress. The dishes are piling. 

Everything I do feels like I'm forgetting him. Washing clothes, making dinner, watching a movie. It's all the first time I've done ""insert action"" since his passing. I'm so tired of crying, but I also feel guilty if I'm NOT crying. I don't WANT to forget him. I don't WANT to move on. I just want him to be back. 

I know it'll get better because it already is. I cry every 30 mins instead of every 5. But I still feel sick. Always.

I have a 6 year old female lab mix. She's approximately 75 lbs and not on any medication.

 A couple weeks ago while watching TV, she was laying under our coffee table and sat up and bumped her had on the table. Then she short of fell backwards awkwardly. She then got right up, but immediately became unsteady on her feet and just sat down and didn't move much. After about an hour I got her on a leash and got her to walk around the yard a bit. She walked very gingerly. Then came back in and laid down for another couple hours. When we went to bed she came with (she normally sleeps under our bed). When she crawled under the bed, she vomited. We got her back out and cleaned up. And she seemed ok otherwise. So we just watched her throughout the night. She didn't vomit again. The next day she refused to leave the bed, hiding underneath it. Around 2pm we had enough and just took her to an emergency vet, because we were so worried. At the vet, they did a battery of tests including a blood test and a sonogram on her organs. Nothing was off and they just gave her iv fluids and iv nausea medicine. By the next day she was back to normal. We assumed it was a 
 concussion of some sort, but the vet wasn't sure. Her eyes didn't lose focus or anything like that.

Now 3.5 weeks later this just happened again, though this time, she did not bump her head. She became unsteady on her feet. Laid down for a bit. Then went to bed. This morning she vomited under the bed and refused to leave. We just forced her out, and took her outside. She peed and had diarrhea. We got her to drink a lot of water. But now she's laying down again and not wanting to move much.

During the 3.5 weeks, between incidents, she was completely fine and back to normal.

The emergency vet was over $1000 last time, and if they are going to just give her fluids and nausea medicine, without IDing anything, I don't think it's worth that.

Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong?
