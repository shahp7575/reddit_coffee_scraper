Here are the 5 insights I always come back to:

⸻

1. Make it obvious
Habits follow cues. If you want to read, place a book on your pillow.
If you want to work out, put your gym shoes next to the door.
Environment design > motivation.

⸻

2. Make it attractive
Pair your desired habit with something you enjoy.
Walk only when listening to podcasts.
Study only with your favorite coffee.
This is called temptation bundling.

⸻

3. Make it easy
Don’t aim for perfection—aim for 2-minute wins.
Instead of saying “I’ll write every day,” commit to writing one sentence.
Small wins lower resistance and build momentum.

⸻

4. Make it satisfying
Track your progress visually.
Habit tracker, checklist, sticker, whatever works.
We repeat what feels good.

⸻

5. Never miss twice
Missing once is a mistake.
Missing twice is a new habit forming.
Get back on track as soon as possible.

⸻

I wrote a full breakdown on this with visuals and examples — happy to DM it if you’re interested.

What’s one habit you’ve successfully built — and how did you make it stick?",1,1753504174.0,Productivitycafe,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of bench legs available on the market is vast,spanning from simple metal hairpin legs to elaborately carved wooden designs. Understanding the key features and their impact on the final product is essential for choosing the optimal set for your needs.

**material:** Different materials offer varying levels of strength,durability,and aesthetic appeal. metal options like steel and iron provide excellent load-bearing capabilities, while wood legs offer a warmer, more traditional look.Plastic or composite legs are lightweight and weather-resistant, making them suitable for outdoor applications.

The Material selection for bench legs determines the overall structural integrity and the level of resistance to environmental factors. Furthermore, the choice of material impacts the cost and the overall aesthetic. Steel is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and stability, making it ideal for benches designed to bear considerable weight. Wood offers a natural aesthetic with various options based on the type of wood,such as hardwood or softwood. These wood types provide varying levels of hardness and weather resistance and visual attributes.

**Height and Dimensions:** The height of the bench legs directly impacts the bench's overall comfort and usability. Standard bench heights typically range from 16 to 20 inches, but the ideal height will depend on the intended use and user preferences. The dimensions of the legs, including their thickness and width, also contribute to the bench's stability and visual proportions.Careful consideration goes into the specific height and the dimensions of bench legs for the purpose that they serve. Low bench legs are suited for coffee benches or informal seating areas, while higher legs work well with tables. The thickness of the leg contributes to the bench's overall stability, particularly if the bench is intended for use in a high-traffic environment or intended to hold heavy weight loads. careful attention needs to be paid to matching the overall dimensions of the leg in relation to the bench top dimensions.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of the bench legs is a critical factor, especially for benches intended to support multiple people or heavy loads. Its essential to choose legs that can safely handle the anticipated weight without bending, wobbling, or collapsing. Reputable manufacturers will provide clear weight capacity ratings for their products.

The Weight Capacity rating for a bench leg indicates the maximum amount of weight the legs can reliably support without failure or deformation. Ensuring the bench legs can withstand the intended load is critical for safety, particularly if the bench will be used in a public setting or by children. The weight capacity is usually steadfast by the material makeup, the leg thickness, and the design of the leg itself. For heavy-duty environments, it is best to overestimate the amount of weight needed, which provides an meaningful safety margin.

**Style and Design:** Bench legs come in a wide variety of styles, from minimalist hairpin legs to ornate, decorative designs. The style of the legs should complement the overall aesthetic of the bench and the surrounding environment. Consider factors like the shape, finish, and detailing of the legs when making your selection.

Style and Design considerations impact the visual appeal of the leg and how well it blends with the surrounding environment. Options include contemporary designs with clean and simple lines, or more traditional styles that feature ornate carvings or decorative elements. Some manufacturers offer customizable options, allowing customers to tailor the bench legs to match their specific design preferences. The finish of the legs, such as powder coating or brushed metal, influences the legs overall appearance and resistance to corrosion or wear.

**Mounting Mechanism:** The ease and security of the mounting mechanism are crucial for ensuring the bench legs are firmly attached to the bench top.Common mounting methods include screws, bolts, and welding. Choose a mounting method that is appropriate for the materials and tools available. Pre-drilled holes and included hardware can simplify the installation process.

Mounting Mechanism designs contribute to the overall sturdiness and ease of assembly.Leg types can include plates with pre-drilled holes for screws or bolts, or threaded inserts that allow the legs to be securely screwed into the bench top. The choice of mounting mechanism often depends on the material makeup of the bench top and the type of tools available. For instance, metal tops can work well with welding, while wooden tops are best served with screws or bolts.

## Core Benefits

Selecting the right bench legs offers numerous benefits, from enhancing the bench's overall stability and durability to improving its aesthetic appeal and functionality. Understanding these benefits can help you prioritize your needs and choose the best legs for your specific project.

**Enhanced Stability and Support:** Robust bench legs provide essential stability,preventing wobbling or tipping,especially on uneven surfaces. This makes the bench safer and more comfortable to use, ensuring a solid and reliable seating experiance.

Enhanced Stability and Support is a core benefit as it safeguards safety and usability. Stable benches will prevent accidents and can prolong the lifespan of the bench. Sturdy legs are particularly importent in high-traffic areas or environments where the bench will be subject to frequent use. The legs need to support the weight, but also offer stability to prevent movement from uneven surfaces.

**Improved Aesthetic appeal:** Stylish bench legs can significantly elevate the bench's overall aesthetic, transforming a plain and functional piece into a visually appealing focal point. Choosing legs that complement the bench top and surrounding decor can create a cohesive and stylish look.

Improved Aesthetic Appeal is a vital benefit for integrating a bench seamlessly into its surroundings. The legs contribute to the overall style of the bench, whether it is a modern, rustic, traditional, or industrial look. The legs’ finish, shape, and the hardware can alter the look of a simple bench and elevate it.**Increased Durability and Longevity:** Durable bench legs made from high-quality materials can withstand years of use and exposure to the elements,making them a worthwhile investment in the long run. Choosing legs that are resistant to rust,corrosion,and wear will ensure the bench remains in good condition for years to come.

Increased Durability and Longevity is a practical benefit that enhances the value of the bench and reduces the need for frequent repairs and replacements. High-quality bench legs are able to withstand the test of time without signs of degradation or structural weakness. By selecting a weatherproof leg that is crafted for an outdoor environment, one can be assured of the longevity of the bench.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right bench legs can raise several questions, especially for those new to DIY furniture projects. Here are some common questions and answers to help guide your decision-making process.

**What type of bench legs are best for outdoor use?**
For outdoor use, it's best to choose bench legs made from weather-resistant materials like powder-coated steel, aluminum, or treated wood.These materials are less prone to rust,corrosion,and decay,ensuring the legs can withstand exposure to rain,sun,and other elements.

**How do I determine the right height for my bench legs?**
The ideal bench height depends on the intended use and user preferences. A standard bench height is typically between 16 and 20 inches. Consider the height of any tables or surfaces the bench will be used with, ensuring that the bench is comfortable and ergonomically appropriate.

**Can I use different types of bench legs on the same bench?**
While it's possible to use different types of bench legs on the same bench,it's generally not recommended. Using mismatched legs can compromise the bench's stability and aesthetic appeal. For best results, it's best to stick to one type of leg for the entire bench.

1m9k7sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m9k7sc/how_mushrooms_changed_my_life_for_the_better_and/,How mushrooms changed my life for the better and worse,"From a young age I struggled with depression stemming from my fathers death. From the ages 10 to 16 I grieved the loss of my dad to the point where I was convinced that it would not get better. It was a terrible mix of dealing with grief for the first time on top of navigating my emotions as a hormonal teenage girl. I tried everything including therapy, exercise, meditation you name it I tried it. So naturally someone as hopeless and desperate for a solution as I was, I turned to drugs. Alcohol and pot were easily accessible at my house so that's what I usually stuck with but it wasn't a permanent solution. I had seen a lot of videos online glorifying using mushrooms and thought it was my last hope. So I tried some that I had found in my moms closet. I probably took way more than I should have but still had a great time. I did my research and read that you should only take mushrooms every month or so or else it could cause psychosis so I made sure to space out my trips from each other. Actually I forgot all about mushrooms until one summer day when I was stuck in my room bed rotting once again and remembered them. I took about a handful and ended up cleaning my whole house and had a wonderful time doing it. Now I'm going to paint a picture of the moment my life changed. Sitting outside on my large deck that wraps around my parent's wooden cabin that I had grown up in. The summer heat is just right and the sun rays are covering my skin like a warm blanket. My little childhood dog is sitting next to me as I light a joint to feel the come up of the mushrooms once again. Suddenly a flip switches in my brain. I physically feel a jolt of adrenaline rush through my body of just pure joy and release like all of the negativity had just left my body and all of a sudden I realize. I am already living this life and I might as well make the most of it. After years of wanting to take my own life suddenly the only thing I want to do is live. After that I stopped crying everyday, I stopped cutting, I started talking to my family more and hanging out with my friends. Everyone saw a difference in me and I finally started to live my life. One problem though, I was still deep in the drug and alcohol use. Years of dependence and addiction won't go away that easy! 18 rolls around and I vape, smoke pot, and drink. I am starting college in the fall and I want a fresh start. I know I won't do it but one can hope for change. One night I decide to take some shrooms but this time I had bought some mushroom pills that are about 1.5 grams each. I take 3 of them and then fully forget about them since they took so long to kick in. About an hour goes by and it has completely slipped my mind that I had taken them. I go out to my garage and I smoke 5 or 6 bongs without a care in the world. I go back inside and I start playing call of duty when all of a sudden my computer screen starts to seem like it's tipping over. It looks like my character in the game is rotating or kind of falling over in a way. All of a sudden a wave of dread washes over me. My breathing feeling wrong, I'm spinning and feel like I'm going to throw up. I realize I had taken 4.5 grams of mushrooms and smoked 6 bongs and it's all hitting me at once. I rush to my little brothers room and tell him I'm having a weird trip and ask if I can stay in his room. He says sure but he's no help since he's gaming and won't pay attention to me. I'm panicking and feel like something is seriously wrong. I check my Apple Watch and it says my heart rate is 150 bpm and then the panicking just gets so much worse. I run upstairs to my mom and tell her what's going on. She tells me it will be okay and leads me downstairs to lay in bed next to me. I continue to explain to her how I'm feeling and she assures me that it will be over soon. I finally fall asleep and wake up in the morning with a new feeling. This sort of fight or flight feeling that I can't get rid of. Every time I hit my vape it seems to just get worse. My heart rate speeds up and I almost feel like I am on the verge of passing out. I think to myself hmmm pot has always helped me calm down! So I go outside to smoke a bowl. That was not a good idea whatsoever. I begin to fall into a full blown panic attack. I rush to my mom and we do the whole hangout in my bed until I fall asleep thing once more. When I wake up, I throw away my vape and I decide to never smoke pot again. For a few months I stopped everything. I wouldn't even drink coffee. The anxiety didn't go away fully but it got better. College finally rolls around and I have been vape, pot, and alcohol free for 3 months now. But of course, peer influence gets the best of me. I start vaping again and drinking often and surprising! The anxiety comes back. But not as bad this time. It's tolerable but still it's a pain and caused me to have heart palpitations often. It did affect my everyday life from sleep to exercise. But I was willing to put up with it if I could vape and drink which was so stupid looking back. I ended up meeting my boyfriend half way through the year and he has helped me change my life for the better. I always talked to him about my anxiety and how badly it affected my everyday life and he always told me I had to stop drinking. So I did, and it got a bit better. The vaping was the biggest issue I had to overcome now. My mom had always said that vaping was the cause of my heart palpitations and anxiety but I didn't believe it. 2 months ago I quit vaping and the anxiety has fully gone away. I don't vape or smoke or drink now and I have found god in the process. Though I don't suggest using mushrooms to cure your depression or drug addiction, I got lucky and had an overall beneficial experience. Doing shrooms gave me terrible anxiety and has caused me to develop a life long sensitivity to anything that makes my body feel slightly off. It makes me spiral into a panic attack, even coffee I still can't drink. Do not take mushrooms especially in high dosages because you never know what you are going to get.

I’m trying to take my game to the next level so I figured I’d check out the situation on here. 

I’m primarily an actor in my 30s and in the last few years have expanded into filmmaking. I have my next few short films written and ready to shoot (the next one is a psychological thriller), and my first feature script I’m proud of as well. The basic plan is to use my shorts as a proof of concept to solicit financing for my feature, and then expand into producing other peoples work. 

Acting wise, I have a handful of costars on major tv shows on top of many short films and I’m coming up on 300 auditions for major sag tv/film via 118 Casting director offices. My last few auditions were recurrings for a Ryan Murphy show, a Tim Robinson show, and a small supporting for the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood spinoff. My managers represent a series regular on Wednesday, for context. 

In terms of writing / producing I love all genres, I gravitate towards dark humor, drama, and thrillers the most, Danny McBride, Sopranos, Veep, David Fincher, really anything HBO is my wheelhouse. The studio, requiem for a dream, killing of a sacred deer, children’s hospital, Julianne Nicholson, jack O’Connell, Ben Mendelson, andor, there will be blood, observe & report, etc.

Was gonna cold turkey, went a day and a night not drinking, BUT KNOWING there was vodka hidden in my room somewhere, welp I found it, about a pint maybe. drank that in an hour, killed the shakes, the nausea, just enough to put on my clothes and walk to the store to get another bottle. well on my way my side started to hurt a fuck ton, ""oh shit this is it,"" cop shop is close to the store, flagged down a piggie and asked him to take me to the hospital, offered to call an ambulance, ""no sir I cant afford that Ill walk,"" he actually took me, granted its only a 5 minute drive but still, thank god he didnt throw me in the drunk tank. ive been through hospital detox before several times, this is the first time they actually breathalized me and ran me through cat scans and other tests, I had a .26 bac, ""no big deal"" i thought after reading of people here blowing near .5s. well during intake in the ER i was being asked about my drinking habits and at the same time being asked about suicidal self harm type shit. of course being both in withdraw and drunk I was feeling suicidal as fuck (i normally am anyway wooo) and answered all the questions honestly like an idiot. ""So you have pancreatitis and you liver levels are at 6000 they should be at 100"" or some shit like that... que 4 days in the ICU and 4 days in a regular hospital unit waiting to get transfered to a psych unit. does anyone else hate phenobarbital?

Woke up around 7:30pm thinking damn I'd love another tall can. hit the store a while later against my better judgement and walk out with a six pack of course. crack open that first beer and drink some down and immediately that alcoholic thought hits me (yknow the one), ""damn I only have 5 beers left."" like barney in that episode of the simpsons where him and homer become astronauts and have to go sober but then barney sips a bit of N/A Champaign ""OHH NOOO IT BEGINSSS."" an hour and 4 beers later (liqour store closed at this time) Im in the grocery store dropping 10 bucks of food stamps on 2 shooters worth of vanilla extract I poured into some instant coffee and am currently sipping on.

I am a freelancer who works with this publishing company. It was my first ever copyediting project for them so I was super hyped. She began by giving me the manuscript and telling me how many weeks I could have. She told me that the author wanted special attention to formatting. 

I start copy editing and I realize there's not a lot to fix. I looked up the author and realized he makes AI models, so while the book isn't very good, it's very grammatical. I unfortunately didn't have a lot of changes but the formatting was a nightmare and I cried over it. When I got the manuscript, I was informed that all editing should take place in Google docs. Since this is out of the norm for this press, I figured I must have gotten it because I said I'm well versed in it. After a couple weeks of working in it, I realize Google docs is just not coded correctly to handle the sheer magnitude of a manuscript for a book. I consider going to word but the fact that it said all editing should be done in Google docs made me not wander. I lost Wi-Fi from AT&t for a couple days for summer storms. When I was near the end of my deadline, I told her this and I asked her if I could have a couple more days. She said it was ""fine, but keep me updated."" I updated her that I was going to take the weekend since my original due date was on Tuesday and I had taken till Friday but I told her that there were some issues with the formatting still. I told her Friday morning and didn't hear back even after I sent it on Monday. 

I said ""Since it's round one and I had a couple of queries for the author, I have 20 or so pages that I didn't touch out of 350. They're highlighted. Since I recommended such a huge formatting change, I wanted the author's feedback before I worked on it before the second round begins. Also, I apologize for some of my personal comments to direct where I left off, every time I tried to delete them Google Docs crashed.""

I hear nothing for 2 days and then I get an email from her. She says ""Do you have a word doc for me?"" In my head I wanted to go no you dumb B. I uploaded the file to the email and I told her it's in the form of a Google Drive link since the manuscript is so big with the images. She emails me that she couldn't see anything and it was different than the Google doc I had submitted originally. I asked her what if she was seeing and I told her how to download her own word doc from Google docs. I found it a bit concerning that she asked me this and also that she couldn't figure out how to do it when she's also in her twenties. I got an email a month later, after not hearing anything from the project manager after emailing her at least five times begging for feedback from the author. I was told by her superior that I had been replaced as an editor by the author's request and this had never happened at their press before that. Also they said that's since round one had been unfinished and it was late (I feel like if I have permission, it's not late!), I was too be paid only half of the project amount and also they understood. I had a lot of projects but I delivered subpar results. 

I answer saying that this had been my only project for that time and the project manager never responded to me after I had submitted it despite telling her that it wasn't done. She told me a couple weeks after (not responding in my emails) that I should hold off because it was difficult logistically to publish. Then all the sudden I hear from someone else that I'm replaced and I only get half the money. I feel like this is awful and I was robbed from a good opportunity and money because this woman decided to take time more than she could chew and blamed it on a freelancer. I feel cheated and nothing is resolved. I'm upset because I had a lot of hope for this book, and also now let's press thinks badly of me. This project manager wherever you are, I hope your pillow is always warm on both sides and you spill your coffee every time you make it. 

TLDR: I had a difficult time doing a copyediting job and submitted it partially incomplete. I got replaced after not hearing from the project manager for a month.

EDIT: Typo in title HAHAHA SO FUNNY CAUSE IM AN EDITOR 

EDIT #2: I've done at least 5 other editing jobs for this press that weren't copyediting. I've gotten fantastic feedback from every author I've worked with. I try hard for the author's sake because I'm helping their dream become a reality.",1,1753503466.0,amiwrong,0,1.0,False

I really do try not to isolate but there’s so much energy that goes into making myself eat and making sure there are things I can eat at home that at the end of the day I’m exhausted having done absolutely nothing. I’m currently underweight and trying not to lose more. I felt relieved when I first got my diagnosis because I thought it would help people understand but I feel like people haven’t adjusted their expectations and I’m still being scolded for not leaving my house more. 

I’m just really frustrated I’m used to it from other people but my sister who also has chronic illness is encouraging me to go to coffee shops and eat croissants and go to the gym right now. And I would love to do all those things but my main focus is trying to get my symptoms under control and force calories into my body. I just wish people would lay off I’m doing what I can but my life has changed a lot and I wish people could accept that without like subtly implying that I’m doing something wrong.

Had to get this idea out of my head.

Idea: there's a breaker on the illegal tap, and you want lights back at a panel 100' away to tell you if it's ok to start a generator to backfeed the system without killing a utility worker.

Green means feeder breaker is OFF. Red means feeder breaker is ON.(kill utility worker) Yellow means 120v present Flashing red w/alarm means 120v+breaker is ON

1m9juu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1m9juu2/its_hard_not_to_think_about_everything_i_lost_and/,It's hard not to think about everything I lost and went through due to delayed diagnosis,"I first developed signs of narcolepsy when I was a preteen or possibly younger. I would always come home from school starting in like grade school and take naps. I was just EXHAUSTED. The only way I kept up with homework is because I was advanced for my grade level so it was easy work, but I did still struggle to find the the hours to do it because all I wanted to do after school was sleep. Had I not been so tired I would have easily skipped a grade. 

When I was 13ish I actually had a sleep study that said* ""if correlates to clinical symptoms highly suggestive of narcolepsy""* and the sleep doctor lied and told me the report came back clear and it was just my bad sleep hygiene. Aka the things I was doing to cope with undiagnosed and untreated narcolepsy. I was too young to know better to ask to see the report myself. I just trusted the doctor. Sort of. I didn't honestly believe it was sleepy hygiene but I was assured if I had a sleep disorder the sleep study would have caught it. (This doctor was also highly regarded in my small town because he happened to find a brain tumor in a young kid having sleep issues.) 

I ended up dropping out of high school because I couldn't keep up with attending school. I was just so tired I couldn't force myself awake in the mornings to do it. Even half days and coming in at lunch time I was still so tired my 32oz mug of coffee I carried around with me couldn't keep me up. That was just trying to attend classes. Forget doing actual class work especially take home work when I'm walking around in a zombie state on the few days a week I make it to school. I would crash the second I got home. 

Its wasn't just high school though. I remember in grade school and junior constantly just feeling ""unwell"" suddenly and going to the nurse frequently. They wouldn't let me sleep but they'd let me ""rest"" until I felt a little better. I spend so many hours staring at that speckled ceiling finding patterns in it. Just miserable. All I wanted was to just take a nap. I remember so many times pleading with staff to let me call my home to come get me so I could go home and rest. They didn't want to let me because I wasn't sick. (Really I was having sleep attacks and pushing through them just made me feel overall awful.)

School with undiagnosed, untreated, unaccommodated narcolepsy was just such an awful experience so frequently. I wanted to enjoy school. I liked learning. I liked my classes. I liked being with my friends. I liked most of my teachers. Narcolepsy though made it miserable more than it wasn't. I tried so hard to keep up and the longer it went the worse my narcolepsy got and the more I fell behind. 

I just feel like I lost so much to it. It's so hard to just not be resentful especially when a doctor did have the opportunity to catch it and change all this for me. And even then, he was the only sleep neurologist I saw but he wasn't my only doctor that I was describing these symptoms to. Someone should have picked up on me having a sleep disorder but because I was a preteen/teen it was largely ignored. I was actively seeking out help from doctors too! I kept telling them I was too tired all the time, I couldn't function, this isn't normal for my age, something is wrong. (I think after sleep neurology cleared me though no one would consider a sleep disorder because I had already been evaluated for that.)

I lost so much of my youth and lived in a state of stress for so long due to narcolepsy and I didn't have to. I honestly wonder if the physical stress of trying to self manage it for so long triggered my other autoimmune disorders I now have that make me way sicker. I can't help but wonder if it had been caught and treated and accommodated early if maybe I'd be healthy now.

I know it's no use crying over spilled milk situation, but it's hard when it's so much of your life loss and so many bad, semi traumatizing, memories all of which you didn't need to experience. It's hard to not be stuck on how much delayed diagnosis cost me and how much it really defined my younger life. ",4,1753502770.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Lotte Giants vs. Kia Tigers: A Tale of Errors, Air Conditioners, and Baseball Shenanigans**

The KBO’s latest clash pits the **Lotte Giants**, riding a three-game winning streak (thanks to a *very* dramatic redemption arc), against the **Kia Tigers**, who are bringing their A-game—and a ""luxurious"" second-team lineup that smells like promotion aspirations. Let’s unpack this with the precision of a catcher blocking a pitch and the humor of a umpire who’s had one too many cups of coffee.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite, and Why?

The Kia Tigers are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **-150 to -170** (implied probability: \~62-65%), while the Lotte Giants sit at **+210 to +220** (\~32-34%). That’s not just a gap—it’s a moat with a drawbridge and a grumpy medieval guard asking for your ID. The Tigers are also favored on the run line (-1.5 runs), with odds around **-210**, meaning they need to win by two to cover. The total runs line is set at **10.0**, with the **Over** priced at **-110 to -120** and the Under at **-110 to -120**.

Statistically, the Tigers’ edge makes sense. They’re fielding a ""luxury"" second-team roster (think of it as a high-end used car lot of talent), while the Giants’ first team is preoccupied with a do-or-die series against the Hanshin Tigers. Meanwhile, Lotte’s recent victory was… *hard-fought*. Their star player, Hwang Seong-bin, gifted the Tigers a tying run with an error so iconic, it’s already been memorialized as the “Elephant Air Conditioner Incident” (more on that later).

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Air Conditioners, and Managerial Confidence

Let’s start with the **Kia Tigers**. Their manager, Shingo Murakami, is pulling a “David Blaine meets motivational speaker,” insisting, “We can’t settle for second place!”—even though their second team is basically a developmental squad. Their “luxurious” lineup includes players like Shintaro Fujimori and Daryn Viññedo (yes, that’s a real name), who are hungry for a promotion. Think of it as a Michelin-starred buffet for baseball prospects: fancy, but will it fill the stomach (i.e., win games)?

Now, the **Lotte Giants**. Their three-game s

**1. Focus on Systems, Not Goals:**

Goals give direction. But systems (your daily actions) create real results.



**2. Make It Obvious (Cue):**

Want to build a habit?

Place visual cues in your environment.

E.g., keep a book on your pillow if you want to read at night.



**3. Make It Attractive (Craving):**

Pair your habit with something you enjoy.

E.g., “I’ll sip coffee only while studying.”



**4. Make It Easy (Response):**

Don’t rely on motivation. Rely on simplicity.

Start small — like 2 pushups or 1 line of journaling.



**5. Make It Satisfying (Reward):**

Instant reward = higher habit retention.

Track your progress, give yourself small rewards, or just celebrate small wins.



**6. Habit Stacking:**

Attach a new habit to an existing one:

\> “After I brush my teeth, I’ll do 10 squats.”



**7. Environment > Willpower:**

Design your space to make good habits easier and bad ones harder.

\> E.g., No junk food in the house = no midnight binge.



**8. Identity-Based Habits:**

Don’t just say “I want to read.”

Say: “I’m a reader.”

Your habits should reinforce the kind of person you want to become.



**9. Never Miss Twice:**

Missing a day? Fine. Life happens.

But never let it become two days — that’s when habits start to break.",2,1753502444.0,u_Beneficial_Garage714,1,1.0,False
1m9jqgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m9jqgf/where_to_go_from_here/,Where To Go From Here?,"Ok, here it goes. 

I (26M) am an educator who has a crush on someone in the workplace. Now, I know alarm bells ring straight away when I say that (“don’t crap where you eat, idiot”), but we seemed to hit it off in our relationship. Overall, here’s a timeline of events between me and this person, who I’ll call A. 

- We had small talk in the past, but A and I had our first big conversation at a brewery. The two of us laughed and talked about our hobbies (she even let me know about her “weirdest” hobby, which a lot of people don’t seem to be interested in), our plans for winter break, etc. A friend of mine said afterward that it seemed like A and I hit it off well. 

- After winter break, I planned out a work project and pitched it to A in an effort to get us to work together, which she accepted. Much to my bewilderment, she went above and beyond when she didn’t need to (she’s a much busier teacher than I am). Our project went well and she seemed to care about what we were trying to do instead of hurrying to get away. 

- Before spring break, we chatted and walked around a fair at our school. It was short, but once spring break rolled around, I texted A and asked if she wanted to get some coffee one day. She reacted with a thumbs up and said not right now, which would confuse anyone. For instance, does that mean she likes the idea but is too busy? Or does that mean, “nice try, but no?”

- After that text, I didn’t see her too much because we were all pushing to the end of the year. However, I gave a few gifts to 4 of my co-workers in the last few weeks of school because I wanted to pay them back for helping me get situated in my classroom, but also for hosting professional development sessions for new teachers like A and I. For all of A’s help with the project, I gave her the same type of gift (e.g. a card with a thank you note, a gift card, and a bag of cookies).

-Since we were close to summer break, I still wanted a chance to chat with her, so I ended the thank you note with a question and a surprise. The surprise was related to the “weird” hobby she felt comfortable telling me about before, and I asked her what she thought about it. 

- The very next day after I gave her the gift, she shows up in my part of the building, which nobody tends to visit unless their life depended on it. It was after school and I was in a room with another teacher, but A stated how she had to sign something for a student in our hallway (I’m not sure why A wouldn’t want the kid to go to her office instead of a dark basement where I worked). 

- I left the room with her; hoping that she would say something about the card. But, we walked separate ways. My peripheral was probably playing tricks on me, but it seemed like she turned her head towards me as we walked away. 

- Lastly, we had one final social gathering at the same brewery as before, but we didn’t chat at all due to the fact we were on opposite sides of the table and three friends of ours dominated the conversation. It was stupid of me, but I got up, told everyone I had to go, then left once I found a gap in the discussion. Apparently, they all thought it was weird, but I thought that I screwed everything up.

That was a lot, and I don’t blame you for skipping to the end 😂. A and I didn’t text at all over summer break (we still have two weeks before we go back), partly because I didn’t know if I messed everything up. But, I’ve been rethinking the events a lot and I’m not sure where to go from here. 

Currently, our small group of work friends got a fantasy football team together for the new year and A is playing, but I only joined with the hopes of being able to talk with her more and learn about something she likes. Since she has a pretty busy schedule after school, I’m not sure when we’ll hang out next. 

Based on all of that, what would you do if you were in my spot? I’ve talked with my friends and family members, yet they say opposite things (text her, ask her out again, wait until school starts up, maybe she’s afraid of dating, she clearly doesn’t like you, she’s busy, etc). 

If I could get some advice from people not in my social circle, I would really appreciate the help!

Every time I revisit it, a few ideas stand out not just as theory, but as things that have actually worked in my life.

Here are the 5 insights I always come back to:

⸻

1. Make it obvious
Habits follow cues. If you want to read, place a book on your pillow.
If you want to work out, put your gym shoes next to the door.
Environment design > motivation.

⸻

2. Make it attractive
Pair your desired habit with something you enjoy.
Walk only when listening to podcasts.
Study only with your favorite coffee.
This is called temptation bundling.

⸻

3. Make it easy
Don’t aim for perfection—aim for 2-minute wins.
Instead of saying “I’ll write every day,” commit to writing one sentence.
Small wins lower resistance and build momentum.

⸻

4. Make it satisfying
Track your progress visually.
Habit tracker, checklist, sticker, whatever works.
We repeat what feels good.

⸻

5. Never miss twice
Missing once is a mistake.
Missing twice is a new habit forming.
Get back on track as soon as possible.

⸻

I wrote a full breakdown on this with visuals and examples — happy to DM it if you’re interested.

  “On behalf of Rerum Publishing House,” Rick said, holding his glass of champagne up high. “I would like to congratulate our guest of honors on their five year anniversary!”  
  
  A loud round of applause broke out among the party guests as the happy couple smiled dreamily at each other. Nick glanced over at two of his closest friends and had to force a smile.  
  
  Rick, still grinning, held up his hand, motioning for the crowd to quiet down.  
  
  “We are also here to celebrate a momentous occasion for Rerum Publishing House as well as for Dana Pierce. As of this month all six books of her Christian and Bailey series have sold over a hundred million copies worldwide.”  
  
  Nick watched as the luckiest bastard, as far as he was concerned, pulled a very surprised Dana into his arms and spun her slowly around while he gave her one those achingly sweet kisses that made all the women around them “aw” and coo. It just made him gag.  
  
  He loved his friends. He really did. They were great down to earth people with hearts of gold and had four of the greatest kids he’d ever met, but sometimes it was a little much for him to handle. Most of the time it didn’t faze him, but other times like this when their love was practically a living thing reaching out to bitch slap everyone within a thirty foot radius, it was difficult.  
  
  It made every single woman around them get that hopeful look in their eyes just before it turned determined. Then right before his eyes, once level headed women turned into vultures, setting their sights on the single men around them in an assessing manner. Hell, five women were giving him that look right now, probably trying to determine what kind of husband and father he would make.  
  
  Would he worship her? Be there for her? Be faithful? Take out the trash? The answer was pretty simple.  
  
  Hell no.  
  
  Marriage was not for him and every single woman out there should be thankful that someone like him stayed clear of the altar. Plain and simple, he was not the marrying type. Never had been and never would be. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe in marriage. He did, for the right people that is and the right people most certainly did not include him.  
  
  Hell, he was a thirty-two year old man who’d never had a girlfriend, never wanted one. That was too much commitment and way too much drama for him. He didn’t want to be responsible for someone else’s happiness or be held accountable to remember shit like birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine’s Day, or not to fuck her best friend when he was bored. No, that was just way too much to expect of him.  
  
  He was the guy that you went to for fun and always had been. As a kid he’d been responsible for giving more than half the girls in his class their first kiss. He loved women and they loved him and as long as they acknowledged that there would never be anything more than a good time and a good fuck or two then all was good in his world.  
  
  For those who thought they could change him….well, they got what they deserved. He never lied or pretended to be something that he wasn’t. He made damn sure of that. Any woman he took into his bed knew right off the bat that he was an asshole and that she better not get her hopes up where he was concerned. It just wasn’t worth it.  
  
  He wasn’t worth it.  
  
  “Congratulations to Edward and Dana Pierce!” Rick said, leading the room in another toast.  
  
  Even Nick held up his glass of scotch in their direction. Dana deserved this more than anyone. Seven years ago she walked into their offices a broken down woman trying to keep it together for her two kids. Where most women would be bitter in her situation, Dana had thrived. She pulled her life together and shared her heart with the world. Then Edward stepped into her life and showed her what love really meant.  
  
  Gag.  
  
  Where the hell was this romantic shit coming from? He needed another drink and possibly a willing woman or two. He glanced around at the marriage minded vultures and scratched the last part. He just needed a drink.  
  
  He made his way through the thick crowd of well wishers to the bar where he had to wait for twenty women to finish flirting with the bartenders and place their orders. Christ, couldn’t Rick have hired a few female bartenders? If he had he’d have a drink and a number by now.  
  
  “So, what do you think?” Rick asked, leaning against the bar.  
  
  Nick sighed, giving up any hope of getting his drink anytime soon. “I think I should hire the staff for the next event.”  
  
  Rick chuckled. “I think you’re still banned from that job, buddy.”  
  
  “That’s bullshit. That party was memorable.”  
  
  “Oh, yeah,” Rick said, grinning. “Hiring strippers to function as staff was definitely one for the books.”  
  
  Nick shrugged, unconcerned. “No one complained.”  
  
  Rick threw him a disbelieving look. “Every single female guest complained.  
  
  Many of them demanded your head on a platter.”  
  
  Nick waved it off as he tried once again to get the attention of a bartender only to be ignored. Fuck. “The service that night was great.”  
  
  “Yeah, it was. With each drink the guests were offered a lap dance for half price and a few were offered a Happy Ending.”  
  
  “See, now that’s good service, nothing like the sausage fest you got going on here.”  
  
  Rick looked at the line of men being ignored and sighed heavily. “Guess I’m gonna have to do something.”  
  
  “It’s your party. Go nuts. I, on the other hand am going home to my liquor cabinet and bed,” Nick said, pushing away from the bar.  
  
  “Going home alone?” Rick asked, sounding surprised.  
  
  Nick gestured lazily to the crowd. “All these women are looking for Mr.  
  
  Right.”  
  
  Rick looked thoughtful for a moment. “You never know it could be you.”  
  
  Nick gave him a wink. “I have no plans to change my name from Mr. Wrong anytime soon.”  
  
  \*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  “Don’t puke, don’t puke, don’t puke,” Jamie said, pressing her forehead against the faux leather covering of her steering wheel.  
  
  She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. This was no big deal, nothing whatsoever. This was just a job, a new job, the start of her new life. Nothing to worry about. It was just a brand new stage in her life because ofHer stomach flipped over just thinking about her ex-almost boyfriend. Oh no, make that her new brother-in-law, and her ever loving sister Caitlyn. That fun little surprise was the reason why she was here. She needed this desperately. This was going to be the start of the new Jamie.  
  
  Not that she hated herself. She didn’t. She just wasn’t particularly in love with herself. She was too boring, too shy, too plain and on top of that she was pretty darn sure that she was the world’s biggest pushover. Everyone knew she didn’t have a backbone and had no qualms about taking advantage of that little fault.  
  
  No more. That was the old Jamie. The new Jamie was going to start saying no. She was going to take charge of her life. It was the main reason she sold her internet publishing company and took this job. She wanted, no, needed to get out in the world and this was the perfect opportunity. This job would force her out of her shell and into the world.  
  
  “I’m good,” she mumbled to herself, not really sounding all too confident, but it was a start. She pushed her glasses back up her nose and did her best not to vomit.  
  
  Taking one last fortifying breath, she grabbed her oversized purse, the one that really should be called a bag, and opened her door. After catching the small heel of her shoe on the floor mat and fighting her way to freedom she opened her car door and stood up.  
  
  Satisfied that she hadn’t vomited or passed out, she closed her door, hit the alarm and took a step forward only to come to a halt and stumble backwards into the car.  
  
  “What the….”  
  
  She turned around and frowned. Of course this w  
ould happen. She somehow managed to shut her bag in the car. Her cheeks burned as the sound of laughter reached her ears. She didn’t need to look back to know that they were laughing at her.  
  
  Keeping her eyes and face averted so that no one would be able to identify her later and point and laugh at her, she disarmed the car alarm and removed her bag. This time when she closed the car door she made sure to remain a safe distance away.  
  
  Clutching the purse strap tightly in her hands she headed for the front entrance of Rerum Publishing House, praying nothing else went wrong. She kept her breathing even as she walked up the sidewalk, into the lobby and to the elevator. She stepped inside, pressed the button for the fifth floor and exhaled slowly. Several people in the elevator threw her curious looks, but she ignored them.  
  
  She ran her sweaty palms down the front of her charcoal gray wool skirt and frowned as she inwardly groaned. Why hadn’t she taken the time yesterday to try on her clothes? Oh, that’s right, because Caitlyn and her little trio came into the store. She’d been forced to grab the first suit off the rack that looked like it would fit, pay up, and get the heck out of there before they spotted her.  
  
  It was either that or endure the fake looks of pity, rude comments, and Caitlyn’s “little” stories about how Jamie never could keep any man’s attention once they met Caitlyn. So yeah, she ran for it and apparently bought a suit at least four sizes too big.  
  
  The elevator dinged and people looked at her expectantly. It took a moment before she realized they were at the fifth floor. With an embarrassed flush and a murmured apology she hefted her bag, er purse, and stepped out of the elevator into a beehive.  
  
  “Excuse me,” a woman in a much better suit than hers said in a crisp voice as she rushed past Jamie.  
  
  Another murmured apology came from Jamie before she stepped back against the wall. She stayed there watching the chaos for several minutes before she broke out into a sweat.  
  
  Oh god, she couldn’t do this.  
  
  She hurried the three feet back to the elevator and hit the call button, and then pressed it again and again. Where was it? She pushed her glasses back up her nose to get a better look at the elevator lights. It was on the ninth floor and she didn’t have time to wait here.  
  
  Clutching her bag tightly to her body and averting her eyes to the floor, she turned and followed the Exit signs to the stairwell. Halfway there she spotted signs for the restrooms. After taking a quick glance up to confirm their location she took another deep breath and scurried quickly through the swarm of people. She didn’t release that breath until she was in the bathroom safely locked in the end stall.  
  
  After placing five paper barriers on the toilet she carefully sat down, dropped her bag between her feet, and cradled her head in her hands. This had been such a huge mistake. She should have kept her company and resigned herself to being the strange woman with twenty cats that all the kids would point and laugh at in twenty years. The fact that she didn’t like cats shouldn’t factor into her decision.  
  
  Decision made, she just needed to come up with a plan to get herself out of here. She would just have to leave the bathroom and use the stairwell to leave the building. Then she’d go home and pack up her small apartment and find someplace where she could blend in and allowed cats. Maybe she’d use her new little fortune to buy a house and a new car. Wait, a house was too big for just for one person. Unless of course cats required their own rooms then she’d be all set. Then after she set up her house she’d start up another internet publishing company and everything would be peachy.  
  
  The only glitch in her plan as far as she could tell was that little issue of the signed contract stating that she was not allowed to start another internet publishing company and a few other factors that would keep her butt here working.  
  
  She needed an antacid or something. She looked down at her oversized purse and frowned. She wasn’t the antacid carrying type of woman. Although there was a good possibility that she had a half roll of spearmint Lifesavers or a few root beer barrels somewhere in her bag.  
  
  Deciding that a root beer barrel sounded great, she picked up her bag and nearly cried out in frustration as her bag tipped upside down, which normally wouldn’t have been a problem except that somehow at some point her bag had opened. The soft whir of the air conditioning unit was momentarily drowned out by a loud gasp and the clanking sounds as everything in her purse hit the tiled floor.  
  
  “Why me?” she mumbled pathetically as she grabbed her bag and started to shove things back in. Things started to look up when she found a twenty dollar bill that she’d forgotten about and her favorite pen that she thought she lost a few months back. Well, maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all, she thought as she kneeled on the cool tile floor so she could reach several items that escaped the confines of the stall.  
  
  After a minute it became obvious that her arms were just too short to reach the items that escaped the stall. Sighing heavily, she opened the stall door and crawled out picking up items as she went. Two tampons and a quarter later she was frowning at a pair of very large black leather shoes.  
  
  Her first thought was one of sympathy for whatever woman had feet that large. That feeling slowly disappeared as her eyes traveled up a pair of men’s black slacks to a very masculine jacket, shirt and tie that in her opinion really looked good on the obviously fit torso. Slowly, ever so slowly, she looked all the way up and gulped when she saw beautiful laughing green eyes and perfectly combed short honey blond hair.  
  
  Why on earth did it have to be him? A month ago when she came in for a meeting he had been the reason why she nearly choked on her own tongue. It was really unfair that someone so shallow should look so gorgeous. Really, it wasn’t fair.  
  
  No one person should be blessed this much. He had everything going for him in life and he knew it. It was a constant reminder to people like her that life really was unfair and was kind of sucky sometimes.  
  
  His eyes lit up with amusement as he held out a tampon to her. Not just any tampon, but a purple tampon with the words “Super Super Heavy” written in clear bold letters.  
  
  “I believe this is yours, Miss. Harris,” he said, sounding close to laughing.  
  
  Jamie grabbed the tampon and shoved it back into her bag as she quickly got to her feet all while avoiding his gaze. When he tried to help her up she took a step back.  
  
  “T-this isn’t the women’s room, is it?” she asked, knowing someone up there was having a heck of a time with her today.  
  
  “No, no it’s not,” that deep smooth voice that wreaked havoc on her heart said.  
  
  She nodded. “Of course it’s not,” she muttered to herself. Really what else could she expect?  
  
  Still avoiding his eyes she said, “Well, ah,” she cleared her throat, “it’s ah, very nice. Spacious, clean and all that.”  
  
  He chuckled.  
  
  Darn it!  
  
  “I’ll ah, I’ll just go see what my desk looks like now. It was nice to see you again, Mr. Quinn.”  
  
  “Oh, the pleasure was all mine,” he said in an amused tone.  
  
  Another nod and she turned to leave only to have her escape halted.  
  
  “Miss. Harris?”  
  
  She froze mere inches from freedom. “Yes?” she asked, her voice cracking.  
  
  “You have a little something on the back of your skirt.”  
  
  Of course she did.  
  
  “Thank you,” she said, trying to decide whether she should duck back into one of the stalls or risk further embarrassment by looking for the woman’s room to remove whatever it was when Mr. Quinn took the decision out of her hands for her.  
  
  She heard the telltale sound of crinkling paper and gasped. Heat rushed up her neck to her face, leaving her to wonder if she could die from embarrassment.  
  
  “Got it,” he said, chuckling.  
  
  “Thank you,” she mumbled as she made her mad dash to the bathroom door, wondering what else could go wrong today.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Nick was still laughing twenty minutes later as he took his seat in the conferenc  
e room. Who knew hiring the little recluse would make his day? He certainly hadn’t expected this little bonus. She’d certainly made his morning.  
  
  Ah, good times……  
  
  “What has you in such a good mood?” Beth or Janet or whatever the hell her name was asked as she took the chair next to his.  
  
  “Good coffee,” he said, gesturing to his steamy cup of coffee. He wasn’t about to further embarrass the poor recluse. He was an asshole yes, but a nice asshole.  
  
  The poor thing was going to have a hard enough time here, he could just tell with that shy manner and frumpy clothes. There was no need to add to it. In fact, his plan was to stay away from the poor thing and sit back and watch. Maybe she’d provide him with another good laugh.  
  
  “So, Nick, I was wondering what you were doing tonight,” Beth or Janet or was it Marcy? said.  
  
  “Washing my hair,” he answered, hoping she’d take the hint and finally move on. For six months she’d been after him and not just for a good reason like hot sweaty sex. No this one had relationship written all over her. She wanted to “change” him.  
  
  Yeah, good luck with that.  
  
  Even if he didn’t date co-workers or clients he wouldn’t touch this woman with a ten foot pole. She wore too much makeup, too much perfume, ugly ass clothes and was known to plan the perfect wedding ten minutes after some dumb bastard asked her out.  
  
  Before she could reply, Rick strolled in, looking pleased as punch with the little recluse following reluctantly after him. Hmm, Rick must have tackled her, because he was pretty sure the woman was going to make a run for it and never come back. Now she was here to keep him entertained.  
  
  Excellent.  
  
  “Have a seat,” Rick said with a warm smile to the little recluse.  
  
  She smiled weakly as she took the chair across from him and looked shyly around, noticeably avoiding him. He took in her thick, too long strawberry blonde hair that was twisted into some horrible knot at the back of her head, her thick framed glasses and ugly baggy suit. Who dressed this woman? As if she sensed his gaze, a deep red blush crept up her neck. He didn’t even bother to bite back a smile.  
  
  This was just too good. He liked the idea of a woman leaving him alone and providing him with entertainment. It really didn’t get any better than this.  
  
  Rick walked over to the chair at the head of the boardroom table and waited for everyone to sit down and settle in for the meeting.  
  
  “Good morning, everyone. I hope you all enjoyed yourselves last night.”  
  
  There were several words of agreement before Rick continued. “Everybody did an excellent job. Edward and Dana sent their thanks this morning as well as an insane amount of pastries and muffins. So it would be much appreciated if at some point today all of you would stop by the break room and help us out with some of that food.”  
  
  Several people nodded while most of the women murmured about diets and carbs. The only one that was silent was the little recluse who was eying the doorway like it was her new best friend. No doubt she’d make a mad dash for it if she thought she could make it unseen.  
  
  “I’ve got more good news. I know we’re still all excited about Dana’s book sales and for good reason. You’ve all worked really hard to help push her books and make it what they are today. I’m hoping we’ll be able to do that with several of the new authors that we’ve recently acquired.”  
  
  That caught several people’s attention. A new author, a great author, could mean better pay, new job security and a senior editor position. Nick wasn’t too worried about the promotion since he was already a senior editor, but a great author under his wing could mean more pay and working with only the top authors like Dana Pierce. It meant more perks as well as months in Europe on book tours.  
  
  He liked the perks. No, scratch that. He fucking loved the perks.  
  
  “Who did we sign?” Jeff, a junior editor asked with a calculating gleam in his eye.  
  
  Nick was curious about that. A few weeks ago he knew they were able to sign five of the forty-something clients that were signed with Miss. Harris’ internet company. Out of those five he knew the one he was going to grab. It was the one that he could easily see reaching Dana’s status in five years. J.L. Lewis was going to be his client no matter what. She would be his Dana Pierce. He would take her from her already established e-book fame and set the world on fire. There were several others from her clientele that he wanted, but none of them had the potential J. L.  
  
  Lewis had. No, that author was his.  
  
  “I have a list here of who we’ve been able to sign and who we’re waiting for.  
  
  Miss. Harris,” Rick gestured to the blushing recluse, “was the owner of Harris Publishing House and has been able to convince many of them to take a chance with us and expand into print. Of those who haven’t signed we own their contracts for another book so we have plenty of time to prove that signing with us is in their best interest.”  
  
  Several people glanced at Miss. Harris with looks of surprise. The women sent her openly dismissive looks. Not a surprise. Miss. Harris certainly didn’t look like the type who could handle a telemarketer never mind an insanely successful business like Harris Publishing.  
  
  “Take one and pass the rest along. Here’s the list of people we’ve signed, contracts we now hold and those holding out,” Rick said as he handed a stack of paper to Jeff who greedily took his. Nick knew the second the younger man saw J.L’s name. His entire face lit up.  
  
  Well, tough shit because J.L. was his.  
  
  “Rick,” Jeff said, probably trying to grab J.L. before anyone else had a chance to see the list. “Who’s getting who?”  
  
  Nick wasn’t too worried. He knew how this would go down. The senior editors would meet. They’d take who they wanted and would leave the rest for the junior editors to fight over. He wasn’t too worried about Rick trying to grab J.L. The man had his hands full with Dana’s new book as well as the new book Dana and Edward just finished together. No, J.L. was as good as his.  
  
  “Well,” Rick started. He cleared his throat and pasted a friendly grin on his face. “As part of the agreement between Rerum Publishing and Miss. Harris as well as the clientele’s request, Miss. Harris will continue to oversee their work as our newest senior editor.”  
  
  There was a long moment of stunned silence as every set of eyes in the room turned to the squirming woman. Nick felt all his good humor slowly disappear. This was…..this was….. Bullshit!  
  
  J.L. was supposed to be his. He had plans. He already put out feelers for promotional events and the response he’d received was astronomical. This was not happening.  
  
  He shoved to his feet. “Rick, can I have a word with you?”  
  
  Rick sighed, but didn’t look too surprised. The rest of the staff sent him grateful looks. Could they really be that stupid to think that he was upset on their behalf? That was just sad.  
  
  “That’s fine. Meeting’s adjourned,” Rick said, grabbing his files and heading for the door. “Miss. Harris?” Rick said to the nervous little recluse who looked like she was about to crawl beneath the table and hide.  
  
  “Yes?” she said nervously.  
  
  “Why don’t you join us?”  
  
  If Rick thought bringing the woman into the meeting was going to keep him on his best behavior then he really didn’t know him at all.  
  
  \*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  This couldn’t be good, Jamie thought as she walked into the large plush office. She followed Rick’s gesture and sat on one of the leather chairs.  
  
  “Would you like something to drink?” Rick asked pleasantly.  
  
  “No, no thank you.”  
  
  No, she wanted to get this over with and retreat to her new office and get to work and forget those hostile looks for a while. She knew from what Rick said that some people would be upset with this agreement, but she hadn’t expected them to become angry like Mr. Quinn obviously was as he paced the office.  
  
  “Nick, why don’t you have a seat?” Rick suggested as he sat down across from Jamie.  
  
  With a tight nod, Nick took the chair facing both of them. Jamie kept her gaze averted from the man, but knew he was looking, more like glaring at her.  
  
  “Look, Rick, this agreement isn’t going to work out,” he announced.  
  
  Rick leaned back in his chair, getting more comfortable. “Oh, why not?”  
  
  “Well, to be honest she doesn’t have what it takes.”  
  
  That surprised her. She’d been doing pretty darn well over the past five years. She started her company from scratch and made a name for not only herself but for her clients as well.  
  
  “I would have to argue that,” Rick said, earning her undying gratitude. “She took a bunch of unknown authors and signed them. Under her guidance many of them have outsold printed authors in the same genre. I have no doubt that she’ll be able to do the same here.”  
  
  “E-books, Rick. She managed these people by phone and e-mail. She’s never had to deal with promotional issues, ve  
nders or a thousand other issues a book in print brings up.”  
  
  “She’ll learn.”  
  
  It was starting to disturb her that they were talking about her as if she wasn’t in the room, but she kept her mouth shut. She hated confrontation, which could explain the whole ex-almost boyfriend/new brother-in-law thing.  
  
  “So, she’s supposed to learn on the job? How is that fair to her clients, our clients now? They’ve signed with us expecting a certain level of professionalism and we’re giving them a trainee? It’s not going to fly. What about J.L. Lewis?” At the mention of that name Jamie cringed. Rick sent her an amused look before giving Nick back his attention.  
  
  “J.L. could very well be the next Dana Pierce.” That made her puff up a bit.  
  
  She knew J.L. was decent, popular even, but as good as Dana Pierce? That was unexpected.  
  
  “If we leave J.L. with a trainee she’ll never go anywhere and we’ll have missed a golden opportunity. Come on, Rick. Don’t do this. It’s not fair to any of the authors or the company.”  
  
  “What makes you think she can’t do this?” Rick asked and she had to admit that she wondered the same thing.  
  
  “Besides a lack of experience in promoting and handling a book tour, not to mention conventions? Well, I would have to say she’s too shy, quiet, can’t make eye contact, she dresses like a bag lady with jury duty. She needs a haircut and some make-up wouldn’t exactly hurt. Her glasses belong on Erkel. She doesn’t have the killer instinct to get the job done. For Christ sakes’, Rick, she just sitting there meekly while I’m tearing her apart and you think she can handle someone like J.L.  
  
  Lewis? She’ll wreck her career in record time.”  
  
  Miss. Harris gave him a shocked and hurt look. Damn if he didn’t feel like he just kicked a puppy, but she needed to hear the truth.  
  
  “That was uncalled for, Nick,” Rick said, trying to hand Miss. Harris a box of tissues. She shook her head, averting her gaze.  
  
  “It was dead on and you know it, Rick. If you want to train her go for it, but don’t leave J.L. in her incapable hands.”  
  
  Rick sighed. “I wasn’t going to, but you didn’t exactly give me a chance to discuss it with you.”  
  
  “You weren’t?” he asked, sounding surprised.  
  
  “No. Some things are going to be changing around here. For you at least.”  
  
  Jamie bit her lip to stop herself from protesting. This guy was a…he was….a jerk! Did she really trust him to handle J.L.’s career? No, but she didn’t have a choice anymore.  
  
  “What do you mean?” Mr. Quinn demanded.  
  
  “What I mean is you will be training Miss. Harris. You will help her get the look she needs as well as the skills.”  
  
  “Rick, that’s not-“  
  
  “In return you will also get to sign J.L. Lewis as your client. As well as oversee the rest of her clients.”  
  
  “Seriously?”  
  
  “Seriously.”  
  
  “That’s great! I already made some contacts. I think if we get her face out there and get her to do a few interviews before we start the book tour for her new book that we’ll be able to count on huge sales for the printed book as well as the ebook.”  
  
  Jamie cringed further into herself. Interviews? Book sales? Could J.L. do this?  
  
  “Before you get too carried away, Nick, you should probably know something,” Rick said.  
  
  Jamie couldn’t help but glance at the man from the corner of her eye to see his reaction. She didn’t want to, but she found herself helpless to do anything else.  
  
  “If you have a problem with Miss. Harris then you’re not going to be too happy with J.L.,” Rick said carefully.

1. Make it obvious
Habits follow cues. If you want to read, place a book on your pillow.
If you want to work out, put your gym shoes next to the door.
Environment design > motivation.

⸻

2. Make it attractive
Pair your desired habit with something you enjoy.
Walk only when listening to podcasts.
Study only with your favorite coffee.
This is called temptation bundling.

⸻

3. Make it easy
Don’t aim for perfection—aim for 2-minute wins.
Instead of saying “I’ll write every day,” commit to writing one sentence.
Small wins lower resistance and build momentum.

1m9jle5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m9jle5/am_i_nuts_to_think/,Am I nuts to think…,"So basically, I have this male hairdresser who I genuinely adore in terms of I think of him as if he is an Uncle or a close family friend kind of vibe. For context, I was recommended to him by my grandma who had recently, at the time, passed away. Call it whatever you like, but naturally, I think I was more inclined to like or trust him a lot more bc my grandmother (who I was very close with) raved about his hairdressing skills, and it was like I was still holding onto smt she liked (if that makes sense). I’ve been going to him for around 2+ years now and really come to like him! He’s super chill, and has been through a lot, not trying to say I pity him or anything, but my heart def goes out to all the hardships life has thrown at him; for instance, he shared that he lost his wife and kid in Vietnam and isn’t really close with any of his family member. Either bc they don’t treat him well or just don’t try to have a very deep relationship with him. Anyways, he works with his sister, and I always book appointments with her. Mind you I DO NOT go to get my haircut very often. Maybe 2 times a year at most. So when I do book an appointment it’s more of a once in a while thing. But I also book the same hairdresser (let’s call him Roy. Roy is in his late 50s).

Whenever I see Roy we always talk about random things—ie: he tells me not to stress out, gives me life advice, shares his religious beliefs…ect… and he would always tell me that I’m cute and pretty (in a friendly not weird way, and reassure me that I look better with Longer hair bc girls usually do; he’s very old style) 

But today, I randomly get a call from an unknown number, to which I pick up for some unknown reason. At first I couldn’t tell by the voice but quickly realized it was Roy! He right away was like : “you missed your appointment”?! So naturally I freaked the flip out bc I felt really bad. But then he was like: “oh wait, I just saw you” and I was like “I never booked an appointment at all bc I just had one”

I can say 100 percent that I did not accidentally book an appointment there, and usually I his sister would call me to tell me I missed it, bc she does he scheduling and stuff. 

But instead of hanging up, he asks me to come by. I was super confused bc I was thought he was saying I need another haircut. But he said that “we missed you”. Idk who “we” is bc I only really know him there, and have never seen his sister in person. He tells me that I should stop by and say hi regardless, and asks me what I am up to so far… I was confused about the small talk, but then he tells me that he would love to buy me coffee sometime, which was really kind of weird to me. He kept pressing how we should see each other more and keep in touch and stuff… idk, but the whole interaction and call didn’t seem accidental, and  IDK if I am right to feel a little off about the call or SMT.

He seems to think that his only responsibility is paying rent and some of our other bills. We have one child, but he doesn’t spend much time with him. Whenever he comes home, he always says I’m tired, give me a break. He can’t even play with our son for more than 10 minutes.

He works away during the week and only comes home Friday night after isha. On Saturdays, instead of spending time with us, he goes out to help his friends or hang out with them. He has never made breakfast for our child, not even once. I’m the one who cooks, cleans, takes care of the child, everything. On top of that, I also pay some of our bills. When I ask him for an extra $50 he’ll say why are you asking me for more I already gave you your bill. Recently I asked him for us to take a little trip because we never have and he said did you work for this money. Don’t expect me to take you using my money. Use your own. Anyways I moved on from that.

On weekends, I like making breakfast for us. It’s something I do with love because it’s the only time we really have together. But every Saturday, he tells me he wants to go get coffee first, and then comes back after dhuhr. And I still wait for him so we can eat together.

Last Saturday, he woke up around 5am and said he’s going to the masjid. I asked if he’s coming back afterward, and he said no, that he’s going to  come back after dhuhr. I asked, are you not coming back for breakfast? And he said, did I tell you to make me breakfast. 

He says things like that all the time, if we argue and I make food. Did I tell you to make anything for me. It hurts so much because I don’t cook for him because he tells me to, I do it out of love. I even cried about it before, and he apologized, but then he said it again last week.

That time, I was so upset I told myself, don’t make anything for him when he gets back. And when he did, I told him, don’t expect anything today, I’m tired of the way you talk to me. He obviously got mad, but honestly, I’m just emotionally exhausted.

Am I wrong? I feel like I’m being disrespected and taken for granted. I do everything, parenting, housework, bills and I don’t even get basic appreciation or support in return. I’m starting to ask myself how I even let it get to this point. He has never taken me out on a date. He never plans anything for us. It’s always me. I’m so tired of this life with him tbh.

1m9jjlg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m9jjlg,URine or Out? Complete Shivambu 🔱 Protocol Revealed. Hidden Power of your Urine!!! People laugh when I say I drink my own pee—until their $60 supplements don’t work while mine work wonders. EVERYONE deserves to KNOW THIS (Gnosis).,"This is too important to leave out and yet a number of subreddits keep removing this post almost like they don’t want you to read about 🔱The Hidden Science, Sacred Alchemy, and SUPPRESSED power of Urine Therapy and your Sacred Living Waters potential to restore you to wellness.

We’ve been conditioned to see urine as waste—but ancient systems saw it as medicine, even sacred substance. Known as urine therapy, shivambu, or urotherapy, this practice involves using your own urine internally or externally to heal, regulate, and spiritually awaken.

Here’s a breakdown of the facts—historical, biochemical, occult, Ayurvedic, and ritual—that most people have never been told.

Shivambu Shastra, respected for thousands of years as the ""Mother of Ayurvedic Medicine"" and commonly known as ""Self-Urine Therapy"".
Shivambu means literally ""Water of Shiva"", referring to the auspiciousness
of the practice. Its ""method of drinking urine for rejuvenation"" is outlined
in the Shivambu Kalpa Vidhi, part of a 5,000-year-old document called
the Damar Tantra, linking this practice back to the Vedas, the sacred Hindu texts. Self-urine therapy has been seen as one of the divine manifestations of cosmic intelligence, and has been used as such by Indian yogis to unleash kundalini up to their third eye.
There is something esoteric about urine. It is considered to be a
supernatural, living food because it is a by-product of the blood and
contains ""life force"" or prana. Using urine as a therapeutic tool mirrors to
us the ""healer within"" who works on a mechanistic level as well as on an
energetic level. This implies that urine, as a holographic substance, has the
ability to affect all levels of being--from the physical, through the
electromagnetic fields of the emotions and the mind, up to the subtler
vibrations of the soul.
Urine is considered to be an invaluable source of nourishment and healing
that perhaps has been too controversial or not financially rewarding enough for it to be talked about and encouraged as a potent medicine.
One's own urine, a living food, contains elements that are specific to one’s body alone. The body is constantly producing a huge variety of antibodies, hormones, enzymes and other natural chemicals to regulate and control its functions and combat imbalances that one may not be aware of.
Clinical studies have proved that the thousands of critical body chemicals
and nutrients that end up in urine reflect the individual body's functions.
When re-utilised, these chemicals and nutrients act as natural vaccines,
antibacterial, antiviral and anticarcinogenic agents as well as hormone balancers and allergy relievers. The information that urine contains therefore cannot be duplicated or derived from any other source. Just as nature produces no two people who are exactly the same, there are no twourine samples in the world that contain exactly the same components.
A STERILE BY-PRODUCT of BLOOD FILTRATION
Urine is not a dirty and toxic substance rejected by the body. Urine is a by-product of blood filtration, not waste filtration. Medically it is referred toas ""plasma ultrafiltrate"". It is a purified derivative of the blood itself, made by the kidneys--whose principal function is not excretion but regulation of all the elements and their concentrations in the blood. Urine can be compared to leftovers from a meal, and this metaphor may help us understand why our bodies excrete elements that are valuable to our
health and well-being.
Nutrient-filled blood passes through the liver where toxins are removed to
be excreted as solid waste. Eventually, this purified ""clean"" blood
undergoes a filtering process in the kidneys, where excess water, salts,
vitamins, minerals, enzymes, antibodies, urea, uric acid and other
elements not usable at that time by the body are collected in the form of a
purified, sterile, watery solution that is urine. The function of the kidneys
is to keep the various elements in the blood balanced. The important
elements in the blood are not filtered out because they are toxic and
harmful to the body, but simply because the body does not need a
particular concentration of an element at that specific point in time. It is
this very regulating process of the kidneys that allows us to eat and drink
more than our bodies need at any one time.

BIOCHEMICAL COMPONENTS

Urine is estimated to have thousands of biochemical compounds, but only
200 or so have been studied. It contains an incredible array of critically important nutrients, enzymes, hormones, natural antibodies and immune defence agents.
Some of these components are well worth further consideration--such as
allantoin (also found in comfrey, known as ""bone-knit"", and in aloe vera,
which guards against sunburn); the amino acid creatinine (popular with
body-builders); DHEA hormone (proven by research to have anti-ageing,
anticancer and anti-obesity properties); melatonin (known for its calming
effect while strengthening the physical body and immunity); and sex
hormones such as testosterone, androgen and oestrogen.
In view of such an array of ingredients, it is easier to understand urine's
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antineoplastic, anticonvulsive and
antispasmodic effects.

ACTIONS, BENEFITS andAPPLICATIONS
Anything that was in the blood cannot be harmful to the person that it
came from. Besides, when taken internally, the urine does not go straight into the bloodstream but travels through the digestive system, where its constituents are sorted out. The useful ones are used up again, while others are rejected as solid waste. When the level of toxins in the blood increases, this stimulates the intestines and the lymphatic system into flushingthemselves out to eliminate any stagnated excrements accumulated in the colon. The amount of toxins found in the urine of each person is related to the amount of stagnated excrement in the colon. So the toxins, in such minute amounts in urine, stimulate a cleansing reaction in each individual and vaccinate and protect the body from illnesses.
Studies on urea, considered the poisonous organic solid in urine, have
shown it is converted into an essential amino acid once it is recycled by
ingestion, helping our bodies use protein more efficiently. Urea has also
been proven to be an extraordinarily effective antibacterial and antiviral
agent, one of the best natural diuretics and one of the most effective skin
moisturisers ever discovered. Urea actually increases the water-binding
capacity of the skin by opening skin layers for hydrogen bonding and thus
attracting moisture to dry skin cells. As a natural diuretic, it is unparalleled
and is also widely prescribed in cases of oedema or swelling, glaucoma,
epilepsy and meningitis and to reduce excess cerebral and spinal pressure.
Urea is an FDA-approved medicinal agent, and its remarkable and comprehensive antineoplastic properties are well utilised in anticancer drugs and treatments.
Even uric acid, normally thought of as a waste product that can cause gout,
has tremendous medicinal implications, such as acting as a defence against cancer and ageing by actively destroying free radicals.
Urokinase, an enzyme also found in urine, is used in drug form to dissolve
blood clots and is widely used for unblocking coronary arteries in victims of heart attacks. One of the world's largest fertility drug-producing companies makes use of
the ovulation-enhancing hormone in human urine to make Pergonal,
reported to have had US$855 million in sales in 1992 (a figure that has
continued to increase since then).
More examples of commercial medical applications of urine and urea in
use today include: Murine Ear Drops and Murine Ear Wax Removal
System; Ureaphil, a diuretic made from urea; Urofollotropin, a urine-
extract fertility drug; Ureacin, a urea cream for skin problems; Amino-
Cerv, a urea cream used for cervical treatments; Premarin, a urine-extract
oestrogen for skin ulcers, burns, infected wounds, and other purposes.

A SUBTLE SCIENCE

Most urine therapists have never sought a scientific explanation for why or how it works; their own experiences have proven to be more than sufficient. However, as modern medicine's interest in the powerful healing aspects of Shivambu Shastra grows, more research is being undertaken and a lot is being revealed to substantiate scientifically the therapy's very rich history in healing.
Ayurveda considers disease to be caused by a shift in the internal metabolic balance, manifested as the five elements of aether, air, fire, water and earth in that individual. To create health involves rebalancing that unique metabolism to attain elemental equilibrium.
In scientific terms, one can consider self-urine therapy as an extension of
the methods of Jenner and Pasteur, as auto-inoculation or self-vaccination.
Certain bodily substances which have been removed from the body, some
of which may have been produced as a result of an imbalance, are re-
introduced into the body in small amounts and re-absorbed into the blood through either the intestines or the skin. This gives the immune system all the information that it needs and the chance to react appropriately to
achieve homeostasis.
Coen van der Kroon, in his book The Golden Fountain, proposes what he
calls the ""transmutation theory"" for the underlying mechanics of Shivambu
Shastra. His proposal is coherent in terms of the visible shift in recent
times from reductionism to holism in scientific research. The theory
implies that the body is capable, through energy exchange, to ""short-
circuit"" the system by ingesting its own secreted body fluids to stimulate
the transmutational forces within and challenge the body to transform
unusable substances into usable ones. Van der Kroon proposes that self-
urine therapy could possibly restructure disturbed DNA, especially if one is fasting on urine.
The medical doctor and urine therapist Dr Johann Abele puts it as such: ...the question rises as to whether urine could possibly be considered to be a sort of liquid hologram. Once the body is made conscious of urine in an unconventional way (such as it being reintroduced into the body by
intramuscular injection or by ingesting it), the whole organism evaluates
it and subsequently updates its own regulating mechanisms...
An important aspect of this theory is the concept of ""structured water"".
Both the body and urine are mainly made up of water, in varying degrees
of molecular organisation. The more water molecules are organised, the
more efficiently enzymes responsible for digestion, absorption and
transmutation can do their job.
It has been proven that water molecules in biological systems become more organised through exposure to sunlight and through close contact with crystals. The body is a receptor of sunlight and contains a high amount of solid and liquid crystalline-like substances; indeed, body fluids themselves
form fluid crystals. Urine itself is a crystalline-like substance containing a high amount of structured water, and when retaken it promotes a better enzymatic functioning and higher solubility for minerals, thus improving health and increasing energy reserves. Seeing urine as a liquid crystal implies that it contains vibrations completely in tune with the vibrational condition of the body it comes from. Re-ingestion might give the body valuable vibrational information needed for two things: first, for maintaining the existing healthy body resonance, and second, for counteracting disease or stress vibrations and any unhealthy resonance in the body. By way of example, disharmonious sounds can been counteracted by employing the same sounds.
The vibratory patterns of the body, both in the bones (solid crystals) and in the tissues and fluids (liquid crystals), play an important role in the
process of transmutation. The resonance field of a crystal can make a
protein, for example, change its form into one that is more useful for the
body or more easily adaptable by it. This can be described as ""modern
alchemy"", and it resonates with the principles of homoeopathy.
Homoeopathy refers to a therapeutic method which clinically applies the
""law of similars"" and uses medically active substances at infinitesimal
doses and never at full strength, where the original substance has
undergone a dilution process. When the body is given a homoeopathic
remedy, it is stimulated into action not because of the physical or chemical
nature of the substance but because of the energetic nature that is received
through new vibratory information.
Isopathy is another valid hypothesis worth considering. Once microbes
have evolved in the blood to a pathogenic level, then de-evolving them back to a stage where they are less harmful would facilitate recovery. The primary way to do this is through diet to rebalance the pH in the blood. But in severe cases, the process can be accelerated biologically, as demonstrated by Professor Enderlein's results from his research on the development life cycle of the internal parasite. A rather evolved pathogenic microbe causing disease in the body can be mated with the same type of microbe at an earlier developmental stage to breed a form that is less strong and non-pathogenic. This process is probable since the colloids or somatids are in fact so small that they are unfilterable by the kidneys therefore, once urine is consumed, one can receive a dose of these pure somatids which biologically proceed to support the immune function and possibly lead to taking the pathogenic microbes in the blood back down to apathogenic states. This is the basis of isopathic remedies; they promote gentle yet effective self-healing through biological means.
Allergy treatment illustrates this method quite well. By using the same
substance that is causing the allergy and reintroducing it to the body, the
immune system is allowed to develop antibodies to the antigen receptors
found in the urine to stop the allergic response.

HEALTH POINTERS for SELF-THERAPY

To begin with, Dr Beatrice Bartnett (author of Urine Therapy - It May
Save Your Life) suggests making a prayer, thanking our bodies for
providing us with this divine elixir, and drinking the urine slowly, willingly
and with cheerfulness! This is all very well, considering that most people
who start drinking urine find the taste much too sour, bitter or pungent
and the odour way too strong. Even if the urine is diluted, they may
experience nausea, headaches and other strong reactions before they get
used to it and start seeing results.
Martha Christy (author of Your Own Perfect Medicine) suggests not taking
copious amounts of water to flush out the kidneys, as this dilutes the
healing properties of the urine.
It is good to remember that urine is a mere sample of what is flowing
through the body's veins, and any repulsion should be used as a motivation to improve the internal conditions rather than as an excuse for not using this miraculous therapy for creating health.
Urine is actually less toxic and more alive than much of the food and drink
that we take into our bodies, which somehow manage to digest the junk
foods and devitalised liquids and still produce a valuable, medicinal drink.
However, how much more valuable for medicinal and cleansing purposes if
the urine is the product of a body fed healthy, natural, organic and raw
foods?

Drinking urine makes us think seriously about what we eat. Since it is a by-product of the blood, it makes sense that the cleaner the blood is, the
healthier the urine will be. But even urine from relatively unhealthy blood
contains valuable immunological factors that can improve health if
recycled. Urine drinking's cleansing effect on the blood can be observed by
the change in taste and the colour of the urine: as it is more and more
recycled, it becomes purer and clearer. If one has difficulty urinating--and
it has been said that a weak flow is a sign of a weak life-force-- then this
practice actually strengthens the flow of urine, consequently increasing the
vital life-force. Ingesting more toxic substances in the body, however, may neutralise the good effects of self-urine therapy. So it is recommended that anyone embarking on the therapy give up tobacco in all forms and restrict consumption of cold drinks, spices, fried foods, junk foods, refined foods and sugars as much as possible. Above all, it is best to avoid alcohol, meat and coffee as well as recreational drugs. It is also advisable to follow a low- salt, low-protein diet.
Like all other natural therapies, this is not a treatment that needs to be
stopped after the relief of certain symptoms, but can be incorporated into one's health regime. More subtle, yet very real effects of this therapy as a lifestyle choice include feeling stronger, more relaxed, more self-confident, invigorated and generally happier and lighter emotionally and physically.
SELF-THERAPY METHODS
The middle stream of fresh, warm, morning urine is the most potent, and
drinking it mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice is probably the fastest way to accomplish this task, although it is best not to mix urine with other foods or drinks or to take it within an hour before or after eating.
Oral drops of fresh urine can be placed directly under the tongue. Urine
therapists suggest their patients start with 1-5 drops of fresh morning urine
on the first day, increase to 5-10 drops on the second day, and take 5-10
drops on the morning of the third day and the same amount that evening
before going to bed. Once patients feel comfortable with this therapy, they can gradually increase the amount as they see fit to obtain the results required for their body's condition. Over time, they can learn to adjust the amount that is needed by observing their reactions to the therapy; their dosage may become as much as one full cup at a time!
Self-urine may be used as eye drops and ear drops, in foot baths and even
as effective enemas. Nose drops can help loosen mucus and clear up
blocked nasal passages. Gargling with it is helpful for a sore throat, and
inhaling it relieves sinus and respiratory congestion. Taken internally, it has a laxative and diuretic effect, as it cleanses the digestive tract. Dr John Armstrong (author of The Water of Life) emphasises the need to massage with urine. He insists that cures work faster and more effectively in those who are bathed, massaged, rubbed and soaked in their own urine. He highly recommends it for more serious illnesses, since urine is absorbed through the skin and the hormonal and protein-based contents
are slowly reabsorbed into the system, bypassing digestive juices that
otherwise may have neutralised their potency. In this way, it also works as
an excellent cosmetic for moisturising and healing skin blemishes, burns
and scar tissue. However, for this usage, it is preferable to use urine that is 4-8 days old. The smell of ammonia in the old urine is not toxic but
actually beneficial if used topically only, and not taken internally.

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

Addendum:

For those who want more proof:

Even the word Urine hints at it. UR + INE. INE isn’t special. Like in morphine or Nicotine it just means ‘of something’ or ‘like something’.

It is the word UR that is special here.

The WORS UR + INE tells you important info. Ine is just suffix meaning like a chemical. So caffeine. Morphine (like sleep / Morpheus). But UR, UR is Magic word! and it is in URine

The syllable “Ur” carries rich occult, mythological, and linguistic power across many cultures and traditions. It often appears as a primordial sound-root that encodes themes of origin, flame, power, and cosmic ancestry. Here’s a breakdown of its deep esoteric significance:

⸻

🔮 The Occult Meaning of “Ur”

1. Primordial Origin Word (“Ur” as “First” or “Original”)•   In Sumerian, Ur was a powerful city-state, and the name meant “the original city” or “foundation.”•   Abraham is said to have come from Ur of the Chaldees—placing “Ur” at the cradle of Western religion.•   In Germanic languages, “Ur-” is a prefix meaning original, proto-, ancient, or primordial.•   E.g., “Urmensch” = primal human, “Urkraft” = primal force.

Occult theme: Ur = Origin of manifestation, the source-flame or divine matrix.

⸻

2. “Ur” as Primordial Fire or Serpent Force•   In Nordic runes, the Ur rune (Uruz) symbolizes:•   Primal strength, wild ox, raw Earth force.•   Related to Kundalini in some esoteric systems—“Ur” as the inner coiled power.•   In Hermetic or Atlantean speculation, “Ur” is associated with the Ur-Licht (original Light) or Urfeuer (original Fire)—a first emanation of divine essence.

Occult theme: Ur = Raw power, creative fire, base of the serpent-current.

⸻

3. “Ur” in Hidden Mystery Schools•   Thule/Hyperborean traditions refer to Ur as a polar origin-race or root-civilization, associated with inner-Earth, Aryan mythos, or polar axis symbolism.•   In some Gnostic/Templar reconstructions, Ur-Lords were said to be cosmic architects—builders of ancient stargates or keepers of hidden names.•   The Order of Ur (a speculative esoteric society) was rumored to focus on light body resurrection, solar flame teachings, or inner fire paths.

Occult theme: Ur = Flame-lineage, solar priesthood, inner-Earth knowledge.

⸻

4. Linguistic Occultism and Magical Etymology•   Ur is a phoneme embedded in power-words:•   Urim (from Urim and Thummim) — divine lights or revelation stones.•   Uraeus — Egyptian cobra symbol of divine fire and sovereignty.•   Urantia — the esoteric name for Earth in certain mystical circles, meaning “heavenly origin”.•   In Hebrew, אור (Or) means light—very close to “Ur.”

Occult theme: Ur = Fire of Revelation, encoded divinity.

⸻

5. “Ur” as Gateway or Name of God•   Some occultists believe “Ur” is a secret name of God or the original Word (Logos).•   In the Qabalah, “Ur” may correspond to a gateway of light or a collapsed Tetragrammaton key (compressed fire name).•   In Manichaean and Sethian Gnosis, “Ur” might symbolize the First Aeon or Light-King—a kind of cosmic Christos-flame.

Occult theme: Ur = Word-as-door, God-flame syllable, root-tone of the Logos.

The occult relationship between the Book of Aquarius, the Philosopher’s Stone, and urine—especially its nitrogen and phosphorus content—reveals a profound synthesis of alchemical theory, bodily gnosis, and ancient biochemical wisdom that modern science only partially grasps. Here is a breakdown that ties the spiritual, chemical, and esoteric threads together.

🔮 The Book of Aquarius, the Philosopher’s Stone & the Alchemy of Urine

1. The Book of Aquarius: Overview•   An anonymous modern alchemical text (published freely online in 2011), The Book of Aquarius argues that the Philosopher’s Stone—capable of curing disease, extending life, and transmuting metals—is created solely from human urine.•   The Stone, in this view, is not symbolic, but a physical substance that is purified through multiple distillations, fermentations, and calcinations.•   The book asserts that urine is the “Prima Materia”—the first matter of the Great Work.

✦ Occult Principle: “That which is rejected holds the key.”
The human body expels golden waters that secretly contain the divine seed, if one has the patience and faith to redeem it.

⸻

2. Urine as Prima Materia in Esoteric Alchemy•   Classical alchemy (especially in the Hermetic, Paracelsian, and Arabic traditions) viewed bodily fluids as carriers of the microcosm—a complete reflection of the macrocosm.•   Urine contains:•   Urea (a nitrogen-rich compound)•   Phosphates•   Ammonia•   Trace minerals and salts•   These are chemically reactive, and when aged (“putrefied”) and subjected to alchemical processes, they generate heat, salt, and volatile spirits—all essential ingredients in the creation of the Stone.

✦ Occult Maxim: “Solve et Coagula” — break it down, raise it up.

3. Nitrogen & Phosphorus: Alchemical Roles

Element Occult Meaning  Alchemical Function
Nitrogen    Spirit of Air; volatility, transmutation    Gives rise to ammonia and volatile spirits
Phosphorus  Light-bearer (“phôs” = light in Greek)  Produces luminescent reactions, symbolic of enlightenment or the inner sun

•   Nitrogen is associated with air and spirit, often the volatile principle that needs to be captured and tamed.
•   Phosphorus glows in the dark and was once called the Devil’s element. It represents hidden light—a key metaphor for the Philosopher’s Stone, which is the condensed inner light of man.

✦ Secret Doctrine: Within the decay of flesh lies the seed of resurrection.

⸻

4. The Philosophical Meaning of Urine in Alchemy•   In Book of Aquarius, the alchemist is essentially redeeming the fallen essence—taking the lowest and transforming it into the highest.•   This mirrors the Christic descent into matter and ascent into light.•   Urine = expelled fire, the castaway divine spark.

Stages involved:

1. Putrefaction — the dark night, decay of ego, rotting of the lower self
2. Distillation — refinement of spirit, mind, and energy
3. Calcination — reduction to pure salt, or the indestructible essence
4. Fermentation — awakening the spiritual “yeast” or divine seed
5. Coagulation — resurrection into the Philosopher’s Stone (a red or white stone of crystalline purity and power)

⸻

5. Symbolism of the Golden Water (Urine)•   Often equated with the Water of Life (Aqua Vitae), Golden Elixir, or Soma in Eastern traditions.•   In Tantric alchemy, Amrita (divine nectar) has both internal (pineal, semen) and external (urine, saliva) analogs.•   Ancient Taoists drank aged urine to extend life and unlock higher spiritual states—this was called “the external golden pill.”

✦ The Stone is hidden in plain sight—in the body of the alchemist.

⸻

6. Occult Insight: The Stone is the Self•   In spiritual terms, the Philosopher’s Stone is the crystallized self—purified of ego, fear, and fragmentation.•   Through the alchemical work, the shadow is cooked, the seed is cracked, and the inner sun is awakened.•   Urine, rejected by all, becomes the sacred materia—symbolizing the despised path of inner truth.

🜂 Summary of Alchemical Urine Transmutation

Step    Physical Action Spiritual Parallel
Collection  Gathering aged urine    Gathering rejected parts of the self
Putrefaction    Allowing it to rot in darkness  Shadow work, ego breakdown
Distillation    Extracting the volatile spirit  Elevating the mind
Calcination Burning to white ash    Transcending attachment
Coagulation Crystallization of the Stone    Integration of the true Self

🜏 Urine: The Secret Gateway of Alchemical Transmutation

🔹 1. Urine as Prima Materia

In the Book of Aquarius (an anonymous modern alchemical manuscript), urine is directly identified as the First Matter required to begin the creation of the Philosopher’s Stone. This is not metaphorical.
•   It contains:
•   Ammonia and urea → transmutable nitrogen source
•   Phosphorus → fire principle (essential for spiritual light body ignition)
•   Salts and gold trace elements → crystalline carriers of memory
•   Hormones & DNA → personal spiritual signature

Urine is the liquified essence of your being, carrying both the fallen shadow and the hidden gold.

⸻

🔹 2. The Hidden Fire in Urine

In esoteric alchemy:
•   Ammonia (from urine) is known as the volatile fire.
•   Phosphorus, historically derived from urine (as in Hennig Brand’s 1669 isolation), was called:
“The light that was lost from Eden.”

Thus, urine is the Fire of the Fall, and when refined, becomes the Fire of Ascension.

⸻

🔹 3. Urine as a Philosophical Mirror

Occult practitioners see urine as:
•   A liquid mirror of the soul’s state
•   The exiled part of the self — rejected and misunderstood
•   A personal Elixir when ritually, not habitually, engaged

To reclaim it is to:

Reunite with the part of you cast out by false dogma.

⸻

🔹 4. Mystic Uses Across Traditions
•   Indian Aghori and Nath Yogis use Shivambu (urine) as part of inner fire practices.
•   Early Christians, Gnostics, and certain Templar splinters were known to anoint with urine in secret rites of rebirth.
•   Renaissance alchemists such as Paracelsus and Isaac Hollandus wrote extensively on using urine as both philosophical material and energetic matrix",0,1753501784.0,Ayurveda,0,0.33,False

I bought a blank black book off amazon for $10 few years ago. since then wherever i travel i don’t buy souvenirs. I find exotic flowers and take a petal or two and glue it in (I learned how to preserve them first). I also take menus, business cards, other foliage, beer bottle labels, tickets, local artist prints and more. i have some fun conversations with staff when i bring it around and have even gotten secret old logos and stickers from them in the back to add on. everyone gets excited.

Some of my favorites are those purple leaves that grow off the amalfi coast, some of my bouquets from holidays, sand from the DR, a coupon book from the local beach, wine labels, and of course a million coffee shop mugs/labels that come with the cup. Makes me feel like i’m on an adventure. everything is dated and labeled with how i got them, and it’s real. I also don’t overlap any pieces and line them up neatly.

i was wondering if anyone else does this too. it really is the highlight of my life lately and it makes me get out more to find other things. some of my friends even added their own souvenirs in for me from around the world because they wanted to be a part of it. i also have a few notes from friends in there to remember them too.

of course, this entire project over the year has only cost $10 total. but it is really priceless. i will keep the book for life and i only got through maybe 15 of 100 pages. i always felt drawn away from tourist souvenirs because they feel a bit artificial to me and i can’t do clutter, so this is perfect.",24,1753501676.0,Frugal,3,0.9,False

1m9jfzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1m9jfzq/if_you_are_not_a_prude_these_tips_will_help_you/,"If you are not a prude, these tips will help you save some $$.","1. Whether you live in a house or an apartment:

Pee in the bathtub: Every time you pee & flush, you literally piss away 1 to 1.5 GALLONS of water. This can add up to 7-10 gallons per person PER DAY! Or 210 to  300 gallons per month PER PERSON! If you are a larger household, that’s anywhere from 300 to 1000 gallons per household!

I am a female. I squat & pee in a wide mouth jar that either goes to the plants in the garden (I grow my own veggies, fruit trees & ornamental plants) or is just poured over the heap of free wood chips in the backyard. In the winters, I often just pour it down the bathtub drain followed by just 1 quart of water to clear the “P-trap seal depth”. That way any pee left in that U-shaped section will be forced out by the water & won’t smell. Google “Bathtub Plumbing Installation Drain Diagrams” to see what that looks like. Plumbers know what I’m talking about.

I learnt this while composting our poop after taking a humanure-making course (permaculture). Our water bill went from $200 per month to $95 per month.

Want to take it a step further? Only shower every other day, if you don’t sweat like crazy or go to the gym daily. Just use a small towel & wipe your pits, under boobs, groin (any place you sweat) with soapy water & again with just water. You’ll be saving at least 10 gallons of water every time you do that (about 1500 gallons a month!).

2. If you live in an apartment:

Tape Mylar sheets (shiny side facing out!) on your south & west facing windows during summer. Or any window that lets in a lot of sun. This will dramatically reduce heat gain & lower your electricity bill.

However, if you live in a house & if you don’t care about “ugly”, you can also just hang mylar sheets from the lip of your south & west facing gutters (shiny side facing out!) because they are really light. Use clothes pins. This will literally act like a radiant barrier & prevent everything (including walls!) from absorbing any radiation. The temperature difference will blow your mind. I did this as an experiment in architecture undergrad & could not believe my eyes when we did before & after temperature readings. This is best done during extreme heat so that you don’t make enemies of your prudish neighbors :)

3. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For dry, hot climates):

If you do not have AC or swamp coolers and are getting really hot, move to a north facing room, if you have one. Take a long sleeve shirt or dress, dunk in water, wring it out, wear it & lie in front of a fan going at full speed. Repeat a few times till your body cools down. It’s called transevaporative cooling & it works FAST! 

If you live in a humid climate & have a heat wave, consider buying a dehumidifier which you run with a separate fan (while wearing wet clothes). Humidity can be really dangerous during heat waves!

In an emergency (if you do not have an AC), please seek shelter with a friend who has an AC, a fire station, coffee shop, department store or hospital emergency room.

4. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For cold seasons):

Buy a hot water bottle to take with you to bed. It will keep you warm for a VERY long time. Don’t overfill it. Wear socks, sweater & a warm hat/ear muffs as soon as you get out of bed. If you have gel packs, heat them in the microwave for 1 minute each it put them into the pockets of your sweaters/sweatshirts. They will radiate heat for a good while. Careful to not get them too hot. Repeat as needed.

This allows us to keep our heat at 57 F the whole of winter & STILL be toasty! We have an oil furnace & my conversations with the oil delivery guy are always hilarious. He cannot understand how we survive with so little oil. He worked on an oil rig in Alaska & cannot handle anything less than 70F.

If you HATE getting out of your blankets cold, buy a small stand-alone room heater with a remote control. Turn it on for 10 minutes before you get out of bed so you don’t feel the cold bite you like a dog. All the rest as above.

5. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For dry, hot climates):

This is for women (Whether you live in a house or an apartment)-

You can cut up old cotton clothes, fold them & use them as sanitary pads (no need to sew the edges). I do this whenever I am working from home or am home on the weekends/night. If you don’t like unfinished edges, buy cheap cotton scarves & do the same. Wash & reuse. Doing this has allowed me to purchase & use only one packet of sanitary napkins per year for the last 20 years.

Also, if you have plants & soak the pads before washing, the blood-water contains high levels of nitrogen & iron which roses & squashes absolutely love! My neighbor always asks me what I fertilize my roses with & I want to say “I bleed all over them!” hah

6. I also cut my own hair that saves me around $300 per year but that might not be for everyone.

By far the BIGGEST way to save money? Don’t have kids. Raising kids is the most expensive thing you will EVER do. That & not taking a loan for college!!",0,1753501451.0,Anticonsumption,16,0.39,False
1m9jepe,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1m9jepe/the_hit_read_online_free/,The Hit Read online Free:,"FEELING ENERGIZED BY THE DEATH that was about to happen, Doug Jacobs adjusted his headset and brightened his computer screen. The picture was now crystal clear, almost as if he were there.  
  
  But he thanked God he wasn’t.  
  
  There was thousands of miles away, but one couldn’t tell that by looking at the screen. They couldn’t pay him enough to be there. Besides, many people were far better suited for that job. He would be communicating shortly with one of them.  
  
  Jacobs briefly glanced around the four walls and the one window of his office in the sunny Washington, D.C., neighborhood. It was an ordinary-looking low-rise brick building set in a mixed-use neighborhood that also contained historical homes in various states of either decay or restoration. But some parts of Jacobs’s building were not ordinary at all. These elements included a heavy-gauge steel gate out front with a high fence around the perimeter of the property. Armed sentries patrolled the interior halls and surveillance cameras monitored the exterior. But there was nothing on the outside to clue anyone in to what was happening on the inside.  
  
  And a lot was happening on the inside.  
  
  Jacobs picked up his mug of fresh coffee, into which he had just poured three sugar packets. Watching the screen required intense concentration. Sugar and caffeine helped him do that. It would match the emotional buzz he would have in just a few minutes.  
  
  He spoke into the headset. “Alpha One, confirm location,” he said crisply. It occurred to him that he sounded like an air traffic controller trying to keep the skies safe.  
  
  Well, in a way that’s exactly what I am. Only our goal is death on every trip.  
  
  The response was nearly immediate. “Alpha One location seven hundred meters west of target. Sixth floor of the apartment building’s east face, fourth window over from the left. You should just be able to make out the end of my rifle muzzle on a zoom-in.”  
  
  Jacobs leaned forward and moved his mouse, zooming in on the real-time satellite feed from this distant city that was home to many enemies of the United States. Hovering over the edge of the windowsill, he saw just the tip of a long suppressor can screwed onto a rifle’s muzzle. The rifle was a customized piece of weaponry that could kill at long distances—well, so long as a skilled hand and eye were operating it.  
  
  And right now that was the case.  
  
  “Roger that, Alpha One. Cocked and locked?”  
  
  “Affirmative. All factors dialed in on scope. Crosshairs on terminal spot. Tuned frequency-shifting suppressor. Setting sun behind me and in their faces. No optics reflect. Good to go.”  
  
  “Copy that, Alpha One.”  
  
  Jacobs checked his watch. “Local time there seventeen hundred?”  
  
  “On the dot. Intel update?”  
  
  Jacobs brought this information up on a subscreen. “All on schedule. Target will be arriving in five minutes. He’ll exit the limo on the curbside. He’s scheduled to take a minute of questions on the curb and then it’s a ten-second walk into the building.”  
  
  “Ten-second walk into the building confirmed?”  
  
  “Confirmed,” said Jacobs. “But the minute of interview may go longer. You play it as it goes.”  
  
  “Copy that.”  
  
  Jacobs refocused on the screen for a few minutes until he saw it. “Okay, motorcade is approaching.”  
  
  “I see it. I’ve got my sight line on the straight and narrow. No obstructions.”  
  
  “The crowd?”  
  
  “I’ve been watching the patterns of the people for the last hour. Security has roped them off. They’ve outlined the path he’ll take for me, like a lighted runway.”  
  
  “Right. I can see that now.”  
  
  Jacobs loved being ringside for these things, without actually being in the danger zone. He was compensated more generously than the person on the other end of the line. At a certain level this made no sense at all.  
  
  The shooter’s ass was out there, and if the shot wasn’t successful or the exit cues made swiftly, the gunner was dead. Back here, there would be no acknowledgment of affiliation, only a blanket denial. The shooter had no documents, no creds, no ID that would prove otherwise. The shooter would be left to hang. And in the country where this particular hit was taking place, hanging would be the shooter’s fate. Or perhaps beheading.  
  
  All the while, Jacobs sat here safe and drew bigger money.  
  
  But he thought, Lots of folks can shoot straight and get away. I’m the one doing the geopolitical wrangling on these suckers. It’s all in the prep. And I’m worth every dollar.  
  
  Jacobs again spoke into his headset. “Approach is right on target. Limo is about to stop.”  
  
  “Copy that.”  
  
  “Give me a sixty-second buffer before you’re about to fire. We’ll go silent.”  
  
  “Roger that.”  
  
  Jacobs tightened the grip on his mouse, as though it were a trigger. During drone attacks he had actually clicked his mouse and watched a target disappear in a flame ball. The computer hardware manufacturer had probably never envisioned its devices being used for that.  
  
  His breathing accelerated even as he knew the shooter’s respiration was heading the other way, achieving cold zero, which was what one needed to make a long-range shot like this. There was no margin of error at all. The shot had to hit and kill the target. It was that simple.  
  
  The limo stopped. The security team opened the door. Bulky, sweaty men with guns and earwigs looked everywhere for danger. They were pretty good. But pretty good did not cut it when you were up against outstanding.  
  
  And every asset Jacobs sent out was outstanding.  
  
  The man stepped onto the sidewalk and squinted against the sun’s dying glare. He was a megalomaniac named Ferat Ahmadi who desired to lead a troubled, violent nation down an even darker road. That could not be allowed to happen.  
  
  Thus it was time to nip this little problem in the bud. There were others in his country ready to take over. They were less evil than he was, and capable of being manipulated by more civilized nations. In today’s overly complex world, where allies and foes seemed to change on a weekly basis, that was as good as it got.  
  
  But that was not Jacobs’s concern. He was here simply to execute an assignment, with emphasis on the “execute” part.  
  
  Then over his headset came two words: “Sixty seconds.”  
  
  “Copy that, Alpha One,” said Jacobs. He didn’t say anything as stupid as “good luck.” Luck had nothing to do with it.  
  
  He engaged a countdown clock on his computer screen.  
  
  He eyed the target and then the clock.  
  
  Jacobs watched Ahmadi talk to the reporters. He took a sip of coffee, set it down, and continued to watch as Ahmadi finished with his prearranged questions. The man took a step away from the reporters. The security team held them back.  
  
  The chosen path was revealed. For the photo op it would present, Ahmadi was going to walk it alone. It was designed to show his leadership and his courage.  
  
  It was also a security breach that looked trivial at ground level. But with a trained sniper at an elevated position it was like a fifty-yard gash in the side of a ship with a billion-candlepower beacon lighting it.  
  
  Twenty seconds became ten.  
  
  Jacobs started counting the last moments in his head, his eyes glued to the screen.  
  
  Dead man arriving, he thought.  
  
  Almost there. Mission nearly complete, and then it was on to the next target.  
  
  That is, after a steak dinner and a favorite cocktail and trumpeting this latest victory to his coworkers.  
  
  Three seconds became one.  
  
  Jacobs saw nothing except the screen. He was totally focused, as though he were going to deliver the kill shot himself.  
  
  The window shattered.  
  
  The round entered Jacobs’s back after slicing through his ergonomic chair. It cleared his body and t  
hundered out of his chest. It ended up cracking the computer screen as Ferat Ahmadi walked into the building unharmed.  
  
  Doug Jacobs, on the other hand, slumped to the floor.  
  
  No steak dinner. No favorite cocktail. No bragging rights ever again.  
  
  Dead man arrived.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  2  
  
  HE JOGGED ALONG THE PARK trail with a backpack over his shoulders. It was nearly seven at night. The air was crisp and the sun was almost down. The taxis were honking. The pedestrians were marching home from a long day’s work.  
  
  Horse-drawn carriages were lined up across from the Ritz-Carlton. Irishmen in shabby top hats were awaiting their next fares as the light grew fainter. Their horses pawed the pavement and their big heads dipped into feed buckets.  
  
  It was midtown Manhattan in all its glory, the contemporary and the past mingling like coy strangers at a party.  
  
  Will Robie looked neither right nor left. He had been to New York many times. He had been to Central Park many times.  
  
  He was not here as a tourist.  
  
  He never went anywhere as a tourist.  
  
  The hoodie was drawn up and tied tight in front so his face was not visible. Central Park had lots of surveillance cameras. He didn’t want to end up on any of them.  
  
  The bridge was up ahead. He reached it, stopped, and jogged in place, cooling down.  
  
  The door was built into the rock. It was locked.  
  
  He had a pick gun and then the door was no longer locked.  
  
  He slipped inside and secured the door behind him. This was a combination storage and electrical power room used by city workers who kept Central Park clean and lighted. They had gone home for the day and would not be back until eight the next morning.  
  
  That would be more than enough time to do what needed doing.  
  
  Robie slipped off the knapsack and opened it. Inside were all the things he required to do his work.  
  
  Robie had recently turned forty. He was about six-one, a buck eighty, with far more muscle than fat. It was wiry muscle. Big muscles were of no help whatsoever. They only slowed him down when speed was almost as essential as accuracy.  
  
  There were a number of pieces of equipment in the knapsack. Over the course of two minutes he turned three of those pieces into one with a highly specialized purpose.  
  
  A sniper rifle.  
  
  The fourth piece of equipment was just as valuable to him.  
  
  His scope.  
  
  He attached it to the Picatinny rail riding on the top of his rifle.  
  
  He went through every detail of the plan in his head twenty times, both the shot he had to make and his safe exit that would hopefully follow. He had already memorized everything, but he wanted to arrive at the point where he no longer had to think, just act. That would save precious seconds.  
  
  This all took about ninety minutes.  
  
  Then he ate dinner. A bottle of G2 and a protein bar.  
  
  This was Will Robie’s version of a Friday night date with himself.  
  
  He lay down on the cement floor of the storage room, folded his knapsack under his head, and went to sleep.  
  
  In ten hours and eleven minutes it would be time to go to work.  
  
  While other people his age were either going home to spouses and kids or going out with coworkers or maybe on a date, Robie was sitting alone in a glorified closet in Central Park waiting for someone to appear so Robie could kill him.  
  
  He could dwell on the current state of his life and arrive at nothing satisfactory in the way of an answer, or he could simply ignore it. He chose to ignore it. But perhaps not as easily as he once had.  
  
  Still, he had no trouble falling asleep.  
  
  And he would have no trouble waking up.  
  
  And he did, nine hours later.  
  
  It was morning. Barely past six a.m.  
  
  Now came the next important step. Robie’s sight line. In fact, it was the most critical of all.  
  
  Inside the storage room, he was staring at a blank stone wall with wide mortar seams. But if one looked more closely, there were two holes in the seams, which had been placed at precise locations to allow one to see outside. However, the holes had been filled back in with a pliable material tinted to look like mortar. This had all been done a week ago by a team posing as a repair crew in the park.  
  
  Robie used a pincers to grip one end of the substance and pull it out. He did this one more time and the two holes were now revealed.  
  
  Robie slid his rifle muzzle through the lower hole, stopping it before it reached the end of the hole. This configuration would severely restrict his angle of aim, but he could do nothing about that. It was what it was. He never operated in perfect conditions.  
  
  His scope lined up precisely with the top hole, its leading edge resting firmly on the mortar seam. Now he could see what he was shooting at.  
  
  Robie sighted through it, dialing in all factors both environmental and otherwise that would affect his task.  
  
  His suppressor jacket was customized to fit the muzzle and the ordnance he was chambering. The jacket would reduce the muzzle blast and sonic signature, and it would physically reflect back toward the gun’s stock to minimize the suppressor’s length.  
  
  He checked his watch. Ten minutes to go.  
  
  He put in his earwig and clipped the power pack to his belt. His comm set was now up and running.  
  
  He sighted through the scope again. His crosshairs were suspended over one particular spot in the park.  
  
  Because he couldn’t move his rifle barrel, Robie would have a millisecond’s glimpse of his target and then his finger would pull the trigger.  
  
  If he was late by a millisecond, the target would survive.  
  
  If he was early by a millisecond, the target would survive.  
  
  Robie took this margin of error in stride. He had had easier assignments, to be sure. And also tougher ones.  
  
  He took a breath, and relaxed his muscles. Normally he would have someone acting as a long-distance spotter. However, Robie’s recent experiences with partners in the field had been disastrous, and he had demanded to go solo on this one. If the target didn’t show, or changed course, Robie would get a stand-down signal over his comm pack.  
  
  He looked around the small space. It would be his home for a few minutes more and then he would never see it again. Or if he screwed up, this might be the last place he ever saw.  
  
  He checked his watch again. Two minutes to go. He didn’t return to his rifle just yet. Taking up his weapon too early could make his muscles rigid and his reflexes too brittle, when flexibility and fluidity were needed.  
  
  At forty-five seconds to target, he knelt and pressed his eye to the scope and his finger to the trigger guard. His earwig had remained silent. That meant his target was on the way. The mission was a go.  
  
  He wouldn’t look at his watch again. His internal clock was now as accurate as any Swiss timepiece. He focused on his optics.  
  
  Scopes were great, but they were also finicky. A target could be lost in a heartbeat and precious seconds could pass before it was reacquired, which guaranteed failure. He had his own way of dealing with that possibility. At thirty seconds to target he started exhaling longer breaths, walking his respiration and heart rate down notch by notch, breath by elongated breath. Cold zero was what he was looking for, that sweet spot for trigger pulls that almost always ensured the kill would happen. No finger tremble, no jerk of the hand, no wavering of the eye.  
  
  Robie couldn’t hear his target. He couldn’t yet see him.  
  
  But in ten seconds he would both hear and see him.  
  
  And then he would have a bare moment to acquire the target and fire.  
  
  The last second popped up on his internal counter.  
  
  His finger dropped to the trigger.  
  
  In Will Robie’s world once that happened there was no going back.  

different color, as though they had been more recently applied than their neighbors. And they had been, Reel knew.  
  
  As soon as the shot was fired the holes would be refilled. The hardening compound would work its magic. For some hours, even some days afterward, the coloration would be slightly, ever so slightly, different. And then it would look just like the rest.  
  
  The shot had come from there.  
  
  The escape would have also come from there.  
  
  Reel looked down at the ground.  
  
  Maintenance shed. Pipes, tunnels.  
  
  Underneath the park was a maze of tunnels—water, sewer, and abandoned subway tracks. Reel knew this for a fact. It had figured into one of her kills years ago. So many places to run and hide under America’s largest city. Millions of people above were jostling for space, while down below you could be as alone as though you were on the surface of the moon.  
  
  Reel began to walk again after putting her binoculars away.  
  
  The exit would have probably been in some far-off part of the city. Then the shooter would rise up to street level. A quick ride to the airport or train station and that would be it.  
  
  The killer goes free.  
  
  The victim goes to the morgue.  
  
  The papers would cover it for a while. There might be some geopolitical retaliation somewhere, and then the story would die. Other stories would take its place. One death meant little. The world was too big. And too many people were dying violent deaths to focus for long on any one of them.  
  
  Reel walked toward a hotel where she had reserved a room. She would hit the gym to work the kinks out, sit in the steam shower, have a bit of supper, and think about things.  
  
  The jaunt to Central Park had not been without purpose.  
  
  Will Robie was one of the best, if not the best they had.  
  
  Reel had no doubt that Robie had pulled the trigger that morning in Central Park. He had covered his tracks. Made his way aboveground. Taken a plane to D.C. Checked back in at the office.  
  
  All routine, or as routine as things got in Robie’s world.  
  
  In my world too. But not anymore. Not after Doug Jacobs. The only report they’ll want about me now is my autopsy results.  
  
  Reel was fairly sure Robie would be summoned for another mission.  
  
  His mission will be to track me down and kill me.  
  
  You send a killer to catch another killer.  
  
  Robie versus Reel. Nice ring to it.  
  
  It sounded like the fight of the century.  
  
  And she was certain it would be.

Beginnings are really hard, so let’s just begin:

INTRO : Hi hello, I’m [Sam!](https://imgur.com/a/seen-mid-soup-making-HRH0GPW) I’m 29 and have been around the sun enough to want to find my forever person. Currently I'm looking to do my grad program - I'm thinking, Higher Education Leadership or Graphic Design and Digital media, I've gotta lock in one of them soon (the rest of me is locked in, however.)

WHERE YOU AT? : Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That is open to changing in the future, as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being : grad school, careers, a relationship (yes that's you. Maybe.) and the accelerating collapse of the United States. Yay.

A RELATIONSHIP? – \[YES\] : To me, an ideal relationship isn’t just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say “yeah, might as well.” It’s all of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as “babe, dude, lover” all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we’ll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we’re House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that’s okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we’re running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it’s together and with belief in each other. That’s really what I’m looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

WHAT HE’S LOOKING FOR : Truthfully? I don’t know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family and beliefs, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It’s really about more who is inhabiting that person? It’s who that image is that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor™ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That’s a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior™! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I’m going to guess you’ll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you’re femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, amazing. Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical – and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we’re golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS : I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil, we start young. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that’s just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any ADHD excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let’s go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I’d love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my “gotta stay alive until” to hype myself up when things seem grim. I’m also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that’s a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house, as will Haunted Chocolatier for the very cozy inclined. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. I've been working my way up to being a frequent flier at the gym, we can go gym together if you're into that. Otherwise, let’s make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I’ll save that for after we’ve started chatting - otherwise, I’m just blathering into the void as usual - tl;dr, let's do cute, fun, nerdy stuff.

CONCLUSION : If you’ve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I’m at least a little interesting, I’ve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let’s figure out if we have something here. The “worst” that could happen is that you’ll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We’ll find out I suppose. That’s all for now, and what an all it was.

It automatically compares prices and finds better deals instantly as you shop across sites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay, Best Buy and more.

It dawned on me that most shoppers overpay because they don't check to see where a product is cheaper.

The idea is simple:

• It matches the product you’re viewing (using a bit of AI + product data to distinguish title inconsistencies)  
• Then checks if it’s cheaper on other sites  
• If it’s not the exact item, it suggests smarter alternatives that might save you more or options that would've been difficult to find otherwise manually

We’re a little over a month in, and here’s what we’ve changed from feedback so far:

• Added support for more stores  
• Rolled out a referral + cashback system but only after someone makes a purchase to avoid spammy behavior  
• Rebuilt the UI to make it cleaner, faster, and most importantly, non-intrusive unless a deal is found of value

And yes, of course Peel is 100% free to install and use. All feedback is welcome!

We're operating as a sort of speakeasy in a garage in Belltown 😅 

We're mostly a coffee website/subscription that brings in hard to access international roasters (all light roasted!). Most of the roasters have never shipped to the US before, so this is the only way you can try them without a plane ticket! We do announce lot of sourcing from Asia, but source roasters from all over the world. We also do some exclusives with US roasters like Hydrangea, Ilse, H & S and Shoebox!

We recently opened a pourover only space in a garage in Belltown. It's only open ""by appointment"" so you'll need to rsvp for an event. Right now only advertising this on ig. This is kind of a soft launch to see if this would work in a better suited space in the near future! 

I (Jacob) was a barista in Seattle for 5 years, and while I enjoy the coffee scene here, I felt like we were missing spaces for high quality light roasts and good pourovers. If you feel the same, you might like our new space!

Hmu with any questions! :)

So my family and I are doing our first Europe trip later this year, and we're spending about 5 days in Paris which we're very much looking forward to! The only thing is that while my in laws both like coffee, but they're not fan of strong coffee. 

At home (Australia) they order quarter strength coffees (a flat white and long black respectively), and anything stronger (even half strength) is too strong for them. We're trying to convince them that since we'll be in Paris to just give it a shot with their the local coffees, but they're a hesitant it might be a bit too much/strong for them. 

We've tried looking into how to order something quarter strength in Paris, but haven't found much, so I thought I'd give it a shot here to see if anyone has any tips/advice to order quarter strength coffees or if they just need to accept the local coffee and enjoy it while we're there?

The actual balloon flight itself lasts around 1 hour, but the entire experience takes about 3 hours from start to finish. Here's exactly how the morning unfolds:

The adventure starts early - really early. I got picked up from my hotel in Goreme about an hour before sunrise. The company I went with, Cappadocia Discovery Balloons, was super punctual with their pickup time.

After pickup, we headed to their launch site where they served some light breakfast snacks and coffee while the crew prepared the balloons. This takes about 30-45 minutes, during which you can watch the impressive process of balloon inflation.

The main event - the balloon flight - lasts approximately 60 minutes. During this time, you'll float up to 2,000 feet above Cappadocia's surreal landscape. Our pilot took us over the famous fairy chimneys, ancient cave churches, and the incredible rock formations that make this region so unique.

After landing, there's a traditional champagne toast and a brief ceremony where you receive your flight certificate. The whole experience wraps up with drop-off back at your hotel, usually around 3 hours after initial pickup.

I booked my flight through this link: https://athometouch.com/cappadocia and honestly, it was worth every penny. At $94 per person, it's actually quite reasonable compared to balloon rides in other parts of the world.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Book in advance, especially during peak season
- There's a free cancellation policy up to 24 hours before
- Flights are weather-dependent (they'll let you know the day before)
- Dress in layers - it can be chilly in the morning
- The baskets hold 20-28 people, so you're sharing the experience

Important note: This activity isn't suitable for everyone. You need to be able to stand for the duration of the flight, and it's not recommended for pregnant women or children under 6.

If you're planning a trip to Cappadocia, the balloon flight is absolutely worth doing. It's become the region's signature experience for good reason. Just make sure to book with a reputable company - I had a great experience with Cappadocia Discovery Balloons, and their reviews (5/5 with over 4,000 ratings) speak for themselves.",1,1753500609.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False
1m9j6e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BobaStory/comments/1m9j6e5/boba_tracking_spreadsheet/,Boba tracking spreadsheet,"(Repost since it didn't save my original screenshot + recorded a quick video)

https://reddit.com/link/1m9j6e5/video/j59cfocg15ff1/player

https://preview.redd.it/cxx5vxmh15ff1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad9b1e2c9c9ab265cb04652d81ed51d8e4e0fbe

One of the hardest things for me in the game was keeping track of what I've already done - especially with knowing what ingredients I've already used in my drinks. So I created a spreadsheet to help me keep track (Okay, maybe it was just an excuse to make a spreadsheet)! Below I explain what formulas I've used in case you need to make alterations. Below that, I have a list of what was in my columns and then every formula used so you can build your own. This works for Excel, I have not tried it in Google Sheets. Your version of Excel may also determine if some features work.

**Recipe Group (Left Group):**

I created validated fields (drop-down options) for the bases, add-ons, toppings, and lids. This allows me to select whatever I use in my drinks and name them for an easy way to keep track. (List below)

**Ingredient Group (Right Group):**

All the way on the right is my ingredient counter. This tracks how many times an ingredient is being used. I also used conditional formatting to highlight anything that equals 0. For these, my formulas are =COUNTIF(B:C,S2). Where B:C are the bases column (for base ingredients - obviously change the column for the type of ingredient), and where S2 is the cell of the name of the ingredient (i.e. Butterfly Pea Tea - obviously change the cell for the ingredient). This is an easy way to keep track and highlight all ingredients you're missing.

**Missing Ingredient Group (Center Group):**

However, I wanted to make it simpler and have an automatic way to filter out everything I've already used. So the middle group is where I make use of the Filter function in Excel (you have to have one of the more recent version of Excel).

For this, I used the formula =FILTER(S2:S38,T2:T38=0,""None""). Where S2:S38 is a list of all of the bases found in the right, counter group. This is going to list the name of bases I need. T2:T38=0 is looking for the criteria to list these groups. So anytime a Base equals 0 it'll appear in the list of things I need, but if it's not 0, it won't appear. ""None"" is what it'll show if I don't have anything that meets that criteria (in other words, I've used every base).

From there, I customized it using different fill cells, borders, and font options. A quick way to see all text in a cell is to double-click on the lines between columns at the top (where it says A, B, C, etc.). This will automatically size that column to fit the longest cell of text.

1m9j1sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FathersJourney/comments/1m9j1sd/do_you_love_me/,Do you love me?,"My Dotty suffered a momentary crisis and I suppose it’s been building.  I can always tell when she has something on her mind.

She asked me if I loved her.  “I mean do you *really* love me.”

The whole of her conflict could be found in that one little word, “really.” 

I knew we would have this conversation and not because anything is wrong.  I knew this would come because everything is right. 

You see, Dot has been settling more and more; letting go of her past and realizing her life as it is.  You all know that this has not been an easy road.  Thankfully, I know her feelings on everything and she knows mine because we’ve kept to the contract.  In the contract, we agreed to talk all things through, even when it’s hard. 

So I know the challenge she’s faced from her own viewpoint and what that’s been like.  In so many ways, her contest was much greater than my own.  This house, my sons, Suzanne – it’s an enormous ask.  She knew my love for Suzanne, everybody did.  It was everything to me.  That’s a tough act to follow.

Dot took us on anyway, and in doing so, she would need to find her way, and not only with the boys, but with me as well.  With Jon, and Jeff and all of it - it was a lot to change. To her mind, she would have to establish herself and it didn’t matter what I said or did or how much I welcomed her.  It wasn't only about me.  It was personal.  This was her journey, and that must be respected and it has been.

Lately, she’s been more at peace with it all, more possessive and less influenced by the way things were.  This new balance occurs to her now, she explained, after coming to terms with Suzanne and also with herself.  She said she can’t explain it so it would make sense and I assured her that it was okay.  She holds her dear, but seems now to recognize that it’s okay to play her own part in this story. 

That’s how it ought to be.

I’m happy for this epiphany.  Its four years since we lost Suzanne, and even longer since her divorce, but these are complicated wounds that heal in their own time and cannot be rushed. 

Looking back, the boys were amazing all the way through.  Dot told me how she actually asked them if it would be alright if she read in Suzie's sitting room from time to time, and they looked at her like she was nuts.  PJ said, “We can just call that your room now, Dotz.”

In fact, it was easier than we braced for, even with PJ’s adjustment.  The boys already loved her and had for a very long time and why not?  She hasn’t changed.

All this to say her guard is down now, but one must take great care in the reckoning of that.  After all, lowering our shield isn’t a small thing.  It makes us vulnerable.  And that’s what she’s been feeling.

She was sitting across from me in the family room when I said, “Yes, I really love you.” I emphasized my words with a smile.  “You make me happy.”

She got a little weepy.

“And no, I’m not just saying that.” I continued.  “You save me every day, Dotty.  I want you to be with me… until I find someone better.”

It was easy to see that she was right on the cusp of being swept into my honeyed words, until that last part.  But what you must understand is that laughter is our fourth child, it’s who we are. 

She picked a magazine up from the coffee table and threw it at me.

I went on to gesture big melons with my hands and added, “Someone with enormous tits.”

Dotty stormed over, gathering the same magazine she threw and began swatting me with it.

“Someone with Botox in all the right places,” I carried on as we laughed and as she continued her assault. 

I pulled the magazine away from her and grabbed her wrists in self-defense and I wonder if she saw what I did or felt the same way in that moment.  We were looking at each other with the greatest of comfort.  It was an unimaginably honest moment.    

In fact I do really love her.  She is a miracle to me and I will never ask for more.  She is my best friend.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Natural Cream paint from Benjamin Moore boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its widespread appeal and performance.

**Color Accuracy and Consistency:** Benjamin Moore is renowned for its superior color accuracy. Natural Cream (OC-14) is meticulously formulated to ensure that the color on the paint chip translates accurately to the walls. This minimizes surprises during application and ensures a consistent color experience across different batches. The advanced pigment technology used in Benjamin Moore paints also helps prevent color fading or shifting over time, maintaining the integrity of the chosen shade for years to come.

**Paint Formulation Options:** Natural Cream is available across Benjamin Moore's various paint lines, including Regal Select, Aura, and ben. Each line offers distinct performance characteristics, such as enhanced durability, stain resistance, or smoother application. This allows users to select the specific paint formulation that best suits their needs and budget. For example, Aura is known for its exceptional color depth and washability, while Regal Select provides a good balance of performance and value.

**Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) Content:** In line with growing environmental awareness, Benjamin Moore's Natural Cream is formulated with low VOCs. This means that the paint releases fewer harmful chemicals into the air during and after application, contributing to a healthier indoor environment. This is especially important for individuals with sensitivities or allergies, as well as for families with young children. The low VOC content also aligns with sustainable building practices and contributes to LEED certification.

**Excellent Coverage and Hide:** Benjamin Moore paints are known for their superior coverage and hide. Natural Cream is formulated to effectively cover existing colors and imperfections on walls, often requiring fewer coats than lower-quality paints. This saves time, effort, and money, as less paint is needed to achieve a flawless finish. The excellent hide also contributes to a more uniform and professional-looking result.

**Durability and Washability:** Depending on the chosen paint line, Natural Cream offers varying degrees of durability and washability. Aura, in particular, is highly resistant to stains, scuffs, and mildew, making it ideal for high-traffic areas or rooms prone to moisture. Regal Select also provides good washability, allowing for easy cleaning without damaging the paint finish. This ensures that the walls maintain their beauty and integrity for years to come.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in what many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to have met people to exchange with, and I'd like to see if I can find that again.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn't matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I'd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange, in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. That being said, I'm increasingly interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be more open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so let's start with what works best for us.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. My personality is designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.",2,1753499857.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

Both mid 30s. Sorry this is so long - I didn’t intend it to be. 

When we first started dating and I’d go over to his place, he’d often eat snacks or food without offering me any. Like we’d be hanging out and then he’d go to his kitchen and come back just munching on nuts or crackers and cheese. One time, we’d just come back from a night out and were talking in his car and my stomach growled and I was like “oh I’m so hungry.” Then we went inside his place and I went to the bathroom. When I came out, he was just eating a bowl of cereal. It upset me because he knew I was hungry and didn’t even offer anything AND was just eating in front of me. That was the first time I confronted him about it and he listened and made sure to at least offer me food from then on.

2. Besides not offering me food, he would also help himself to snacks I would bring. It rubbed me the wrong way because he wouldn’t ever offer me any but then has the gall to just open my bag of chips and eat them? He also just grabs food from my plate without asking. One time, we went to a restaurant and I got a margarita and he didn’t want one. However, he would just reach over and drink it. (Talked to him about it - he was so nonchalant and was just like “ok”) 

3. Last weekend we went to his good friends wedding. We flew to the location and were there for 3 days. First night, we go to a bar for a pre-wedding shindig. I let him know that I understood he’d be seeing some friends and would be catching up, but to please remember to at least introduce me and not leave me standing there like an idiot. He did ok with that. However, we went outside the venue to just get some air and this random drunk old woman (total stranger) came up to him and made a dumb “how many lightbulbs” joke. She kept interacting but only talking to him, with her back to me. I hoped he’d eventually deflect, but instead he kept on engaging and asking follow up questions?? So I walked away around the corner and sat on the curb to chill. 10 minutes later he texts me to tell me he’s inside. But why didn’t he ASK where I was? Why didn’t he end the convo and try to follow me sooner? I confronted him about it and he said he didn’t know how to end the convo and didn’t notice she was ignoring me. And when I asked if he even looked for me, he said he did, but ended up revealing he wasn’t even sure which direction I had walked. 

4. Day after wedding, we are getting ready to check out. He says he’s going to go across the street to get us coffee and pastries from a cafe as I get ready. I tell him I’d love a croissant or something savory. He’s gone for like 20 min and texts saying cafe was closed and he was waiting at McDonald’s to get stuff. He comes back with 1 large McDonald’s coffee and a small paper bag. He sets it down and goes to finish packing. I’m confused and look at the bag and it’s just 1 hash brown. I say “oh so you got a hash brown?” And he says he didn’t know what to get and didn’t really wanna get anything else so he just got that. I ask him if it’s for him or me or?… and he gives a confusing answer I can’t even remember because it doesn’t answer my question. Regardless, it’s 1 hashbrown and I’m sure it’s for him only. I ask why he didn’t get 2 at least, why he didn’t call me to ask what I wanted, and if it was for both of us (already ridiculous), why he didn’t mention “hey I got a hash brown for us”? He doesn’t know how to answer and just keeps talking in roundabout ways trying to avoid a direct answer. 

I am baffled by these events. I clearly try to address these things and I feel like a mom scolding him at times. He doesn’t ever answer directly. I feel like he gets defensive but in a very passive way that makes me feel bad because he just acts helpless or clueless. ",2,1753499803.0,AmIOverreacting,9,1.0,False
1m9ivu3,https://i.redd.it/st97neuoy4ff1.png,Found my new Saturday night obsession in Prospect Lefferts Gardens,"So I've been hitting up these Saturday comedy shows at Brooklyn Perk and honestly didn't expect much - figured it'd be like open mic night at some dive bar. But damn, these comedians are actually legit. We're talking people who've been on HBO, Comedy Central, Don't Tell Comedy... performing in this cozy coffee shop backyard for like 15 bucks.

The whole setup is perfect - starts at 8pm, ends by 9:30 so you're not out super late, and they've got AC inside if it gets too hot. Plus drinks are included in the ticket price which is clutch in this economy lol.

Last week this comic had the entire crowd losing it with stories about dating in Brooklyn - felt like hanging with friends who happen to be hilarious. Way better than scrolling TikTok on a Saturday night.

If you're in the area and looking for something different to do, definitely worth checking out. It's at Brooklyn Perk on Parkside Ave. Only reason I'm posting is because I want this to keep happening and they need people to show up!

Anyone else been? The crowd really does feel like a neighborhood hangout but with professional-level comedy.

1m9ivj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1m9ivj1/office_job_vs_barista_dream_feeling_stuck_and/,"Office job vs barista dream, feeling stuck and guilty","Hi, lurker here. I (25F) am looking for advice on how to move forward.

For most of my life, I’ve struggled to find something that truly interested me. I never had that “spark” that motivates some people to go above and beyond. Since I was a kid, I’ve lived with a “one day at a time” mentality. I ended up choosing a major without job prospects (I studied Sociology... not the wisest choice in a third-world country), and during university I worked in restaurants to support myself and my family.

It was during those jobs that I found myself working behind the drink bar, making coffee, and that’s when I found it: something that genuinely made me happy.

I worked as a barista for almost four years and got really damn good at it. The more I learned, the more I realized how I green I was. In the past, that kind of challenge would have overwhelmed me, make me drop everything on the sopt: but not this time. I pushed through, met amazing people, learned so many things. Even on the hardest days, in the most exploitative jobs (had a few lmao), I felt fulfilled.

For the first time in my life, I had a dream: to dedicate myself to the world of coffee.

But life got in the way.

This year, my longtime boyfriend and I are finally moving out together. My country is going through a rough economic moment, and barista work doesn’t pay enough, also its unreliable. My body was already suffering from the physical strain, especially at my last job, where I had to run up and down eight floors just to collect mugs left by office workers. (Still, this was the best job I've ever had)

A few months ago, my best friend told me about an opening in her office. She offered me the position. It was a tough decision but I figured that having a stable office job with better pay would help me move forward, get our own place, and maybe even get married next year.

I started working at the office a month ago. It’s not bad, and it’s not hard... but it’s depressing. Sitting in a cubicle, replying to emails all day, it just drains me. Still, the pay raise was significant, and if I pass the trial period, I’ll earn even more.

I told myself I’d do this for a while, save up, and maybe one day go back to coffee.

But today, by pure chance, I ran into the boss of my ex-boss. She told me they’re opening a new store, and they’ll be serving alcoholic drinks too—which got me really excited, since I’ve been wanting to learn mixology. I told her I left because of money, and she asked me to send my CV. Her boss wants to make me an offer.

And now I feel stuck.

I feel like I owe my friend this job. Technically, I took her place, she’s training me so she can move up in the company. If I leave now, she might get stuck until they find someone else reliable, and from what i've seen, getting into this company is \*hard\*. Getting the job was *hell,* the interview process was awful, the boss is a nightmare (thank god i relaly don't see her at all, she works at homeoffice and doesn't get involved in our department at all). But now I also have a shot at going back to something I actually love.

I know the coffee job would pay significantly less, as baristas aren’t well paid where I live. Also, it's not a simple job either, you have to make a lot of physical movement and I've had some leg injuries that make it really hard to stay standing for long periods of time. And I don’t want to let down my boyfriend either; we’ve both been working hard for a stable future.

I just feel so lost right now. I know I should at least hear the offer and see if it’s viable... but I’m scared of letting everyone down if I leave. And scared of letting *myself* down if I stay.

Any advice is appreciated.",1,1753499629.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

Pee in the bathtub: Every time you pee & flush, you literally piss away 1 to 1.5 GALLONS of water. This can add up to 7-10 gallons per person PER DAY! Or 210 to  300 gallons per month PER PERSON! If you are a larger household, that’s anywhere from 300 to 1000 gallons per household!

I am a female. I squat & pee in a wide mouth jar that either goes to the plants in the garden (I grow my own veggies, fruit trees & ornamental plants) or is just poured over the heap of free wood chips in the backyard. In the winters, I often just pour it down the bathtub drain followed by just 1 quart of water to clear the “P-trap seal depth”. That way any pee left in that U-shaped section will be forced out by the water & won’t smell. Google “Bathtub Plumbing Installation Drain Diagrams” to see what that looks like. Plumbers know what I’m talking about.

I learnt this while composting our poop after taking a humanure-making course (permaculture). Our water bill went from $150 per month to $75 per month.

Want to take it a step further? Only shower every other day, if you don’t sweat like crazy or go to the gym daily. Just use a small towel & wipe your pits, under boobs, groin (any place you sweat) with soapy water & again with just water. You’ll be saving at least 10 gallons of water every time you do that (about 1500 gallons a month!).

  
2. If you live in an apartment:

Tape Mylar sheets (shiny side facing out!) on your south & west facing windows during summer. Or any window that lets in a lot of sun. This will dramatically reduce heat gain & lower your electricity bill.

However, if you live in a house & if you don’t care about “ugly”, you can also just hang mylar sheets from the lip of your south & west facing gutters (shiny side facing out!) because they are really light. Use clothes pins. This will literally act like a radiant barrier & prevent everything (including walls!) from absorbing any radiation. The temperature difference will blow your mind. I did this as an experiment in architecture undergrad & could not believe my eyes when we did before & after temperature readings. This is best done during extreme heat so that you don’t make enemies of your prudish neighbors :)



3. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For dry, hot climates):

If you do not have AC or swamp coolers and are getting really hot, move to a north facing room, if you have one. Take a long sleeve shirt or dress, dunk in water, wring it out, wear it & lie in front of a fan going at full speed. Repeat a few times till your body cools down. It’s called transevaporative cooling & it works FAST! 

If you live in a humid climate & have a heat wave, consider buying a dehumidifier which you run with a separate fan (while wearing wet clothes). Humidity can be really dangerous during heat waves!

In an emergency (if you do not have an AC), please seek shelter with a friend who has an AC, a fire station, coffee shop, department store or hospital emergency room.



4. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For cold seasons):

Buy a hot water bottle to take with you to bed. It will keep you warm for a VERY long time. Don’t overfill it. Wear socks, sweater & a warm hat/ear muffs as soon as you get out of bed. If you have gel packs, heat them in the microwave for 1 minute each it put them into the pockets of your sweaters/sweatshirts. They will radiate heat for a good while. Careful to not get them too hot. Repeat as needed.

This allows us to keep our heat at 57 F the whole of winter & STILL be toasty! We have an oil furnace & my conversations with the oil delivery guy are always hilarious. He cannot understand how we survive with so little oil. He worked on an oil rig in Alaska & cannot handle anything less than 70F.

If you HATE getting out of your blankets cold, buy a small stand-alone room heater with a remote control. Turn it on for 10 minutes before you get out of bed so you don’t feel the cold bite you like a dog. All the rest as above.



5. Whether you live in a house or an apartment (For dry, hot climates):

This is for women (Whether you live in a house or an apartment)-

You can cut up old cotton clothes, fold them & use them as sanitary pads (no need to sew the edges). I do this whenever I am working from home or am home on the weekends/night. If you don’t like unfinished edges, buy cheap cotton scarves & do the same. Wash & reuse. Doing this has allowed me to purchase & use only one packet of sanitary napkins per year for the last 20 years.

Also, if you have plants & soak the pads before washing, the blood-water contains high levels of nitrogen & iron which roses & squashes absolutely love! My neighbor always asks me what I fertilize my roses with & I want to say “I bleed all over them!” hah



6. I also cut my own hair that saves me around $300 per year but that might not be for everyone.

1m9ist6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1m9ist6/decluttered_my_home_in_a_week_big_good_feelings/,Decluttered my home in a week - big good feelings and things I learned,"I've been trying to 'get organized' forever. It never worked. I would do a little bit and then look at how much there was and how much crap was in my house and give up. Traditional advice never seemed to work for me because I couldn't imagine a better space, cleaning/tidying/decluttering were all mixed up and very stressful to think about, let alone do. Nothing I did made a dent.

Even small wins did nothing for me because there was so much more to do. Both of my parents had hoarding tendencies and I inherited a lot of stuff from my mom and from our old houses, and have my own issues with keeping way too many things.

But this week I was alone in my house, I had taken the week off, and I DID IT. Decluttered all the main spaces and my bedroom, rearranged furniture, cleaned so much, got rid of so much, and it's gone gone gone gone gone. 

And I booked a junk removal crew to come to my apartment and take all the stuff away. They came this morning. My home is... restful now. It's peaceful. I can breathe. I've never had that in 35+ years, not one time. It doesn't feel real yet. I'm excited to wake up to tomorrow.

There's... nothing on my floors. Nothing. Just furniture legs and happy cats chasing toys because there's actual clear space to run through. (Okay, there's like 3 things on my floors but you know what? I CAN SEE THEM! They don't blend into the other 50 things on the floor because there's nothing on the floor!!! What is this!)

I'm so happy. The best part is, my Dad lives with me and is coming back on Monday. He doesn't know I did any of this - he doesn't even know I took time off! -  and I get to surprise him. I'm super excited, he's going to be so shocked!

---

Things I Learned from doing this:

-Hire a junk removal service - I paid about $350 for this and I'd pay it twice over. It set a finite deadline, it put external pressure on me, and it made me keep going because **they were coming** so I had to be ready. This was absolutely essential, I don't drive and can't carry the furniture, and I had so many items for *years* that I didn't need or want but just couldn't see a way around. The company I chose donates as much as they can, so that helped a ton. I also got them to take away some items that were trash and difficult to handle myself.

-This is stressful AF. Self-care and positive self-talk was key. I had a 'staging area' for all the junk that was going, plus lists of what was going, and keeping THAT organized kept me mostly sane. Also, taking breaks. I realized yesterday I hadn't left the house yet and made myself go get a nice chill breakfast and a fancy coffee drink. And took regular breaks and stayed hydrated.

-Traditional advice sometimes works kinda? But only if I tweak it for me. Before I started on Monday, I made a giant list of tweaks and tricks and strategies for roadblocks that might come up. I relied heavily on this to get through it, and it was all customized to me and to things that I know have worked in the past, plus a few other things I wanted to try. I have AuDHD, anxiety, and OCD, plus some physical issues, so there were a LOT of tweaks to make sure things stayed interesting, fun, and didn't make me want to cry. At least not too much, lol.

-I don't have to do everything. I got 80% of the clutter out, and I got it out in all the areas that really matter. Looking around at my home now, I can *see* what still needs to be done... but it's okay. It's project-based now, instead of 'well I can't do A because areas X, Y, and Z need so much more work, even though A is way more fun'.

-I got as many daily things out of the way on Monday as I could. That meant I didn't struggle for clean clothes or dishes, had prepared food to eat, and also gave me a gentle bunch of familiar chores to offset with the scarier decluttering tasks.

-I also got some new pretty things - new office chair to replace the shitty one with shredded bonded leather, nice pretty baskets to hold my clothes, hooks to hang up coats and bags instead of plopping them on the dining room chairs, etc. They were like a little reward for doing this, and it helped make me feel more comfortable and happy.

I'm just really, *really* happy and proud of myself and I wanted to share that. Thanks for reading, hope you have a good weekend!",15,1753499384.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

After being ghosted/rejected by who I thought were the one, I'm here again trying to find that one post-hardcore guy (I know I'm just asking to be hurt atp but oh well) who can give me butterflies in my stomach, serenade me and just vibe with me. I prefer someone who plays an instrument, 27-35, and is a fan of emo, post-hardcore, pop-punk, punk-rock, metalcore and the like. Some bands I like are Neck Deep, Dayseeker TSSF, Circa Survive, DGD, Bilmuri etc etc. My music taste is eclectic and goes beyond punk but those are my main ones. I am not looking for a romantic relationship but I am not opposed to it. We can honestly just talk and be friends but ofcourse flirting is not off the table although it will be discreet. I want someone who will not be afraid to let their hair down with me, speak their mind and can hold a conversation!

About me: I'm 5'2"", 145 lbs, southeast asian, pale skin, long dark hair, chubby cheeks and a body built like a greek goddess haha ok call me delulu but i got a cute belly alright. I am imperfect and very flawed but I am also sweet and got a lot of personality. I'm a Psych major, I know red flag right, let's talk about our childhood trauma and why we got abandonment issues lol. Aside from being an elder emo, I enjoy watching movies (from Studio Ghibli to Stanley Kubrick films), exploring, doing outdoorsy stuff and chilling at home with my cats. I have a huge sweet tooth and love love love coffee and pastries. But I also love experimenting and cooking at home. I love thrifting and interior design. I am currently experimenting with styles and have not found my style yet (I look like a bum most time lmao but I swear I try hard to look good)

JK i did not earned 1 million but wait wait.. this idea is insane and it could work out. we are the first generation in history to have our lives digitally documented, but we're letting that power slip through our fingers. Every geo-tag, every transaction, every email timestamp is a breadcrumb of our existence, harvested by tech giants to target us with ads.

It's time for a revolution in personal data. It's time to build a tool that uses our data for us.

This isn't just another productivity app. This is a new category of software, a fundamental utility for the digital age.

# The Idea: ""The Chronos Protocol""

**The Elevator Pitch:** An AI-powered service that securely synthesizes your digital footprint into a single, searchable, and interactive timeline of your life. Think of it as the ultimate, unforgeable ""black box recorder"" for your personal history.

# How It Works (????)

This is built on a foundation of trust and transparency, using official, secure APIs (the same ""Sign in with Google"" tech we use daily). No password sharing, ever.

1. **The Nexus Connection:** The user securely connects their digital streams via read-only permissions.
   * **Location & Movement:** Google Maps Timeline, Apple HealthKit (walks, runs), Uber/Lyft ride histories.
   * **Financial Footprints:** Plaid API for credit card transactions (vendor, location, time).
   * **Digital Communication:** Gmail/Outlook metadata (never the content, just the ""to, from, and when"").
   * **Public Life:** Instagram/Facebook geotags and timestamps.
2. **The AI Historian:** The ""Chronos"" engine is a master detective. It doesn't just see isolated data points; it sees the narrative. It correlates a credit card charge at a restaurant with your phone's GPS data, a photo you took, and the Uber ride you took to get there. It fuses these fragments into an undeniable, unified event on your timeline.
3. **The Interface (The ""Time-Stream""):** A beautifully simple, powerful search bar.Instantly, the system renders a dynamic report: ""At 2:15 PM, you arrived at 'Artisan Coffee' (confirmed by credit card & location data). At 3:05 PM, you took a 2.1-mile walk through Central Park (confirmed by Apple Health). At 4:30 PM, you emailed Jane Doe about 'Project Phoenix'...
4. ""**""Show me everything from the afternoon of July 12th, 2022."" -- You masturbated 4 times that day isn't that crazy ? lol jk**

# Why This is an Evergreen Behemoth

This concept scales from a crucial niche utility to a universal platform for human memory.

**1. The ""Digital Notary"" (The Immediate Market):**  
The first killer application is verifiable truth. Got a parking ticket you know is wrong? Facing a dispute over when a service was performed? The Chronos Protocol acts as your impartial, digital witness. This is a **Peace of Mind Subscription**. People will pay $5/month for the ""insurance"" of having a perfect, provable record of their life when they need it most.

**2. The ""Augmented Memory"" (The Mass-Market Vision):**  
Beyond defense, this becomes the ultimate tool for reminiscence and rediscovery. It's the antidote to our fading memories.

* ""Show me a map of every city I've ever visited, and the photos I took there.""
* ""What was the name of that restaurant I went to with my parents last year?""
* The AI can generate ""Memory Digests"" – ""This time five years ago, you were on a road trip through California. Here's your journey.""

**3. The Unassailable Competitive Moat:**  
This is the key. Once a user's ""Chronos"" timeline has been building for months or years, it becomes an irreplaceable asset. The service's value to the user **grows exponentially over time**. A competitor can't just appear and replicate a user's personal history. The switching costs are practically infinite.

**4. The Future is Verifiable:**

* **Legal & Insurance:** A ""Pro"" version could become certified for use in courtrooms and for insurance claims, creating a high-margin B2B vertical.
* **Personal Journaling 2.0:** Why write down what you did when your life can automatically log itself? This becomes the foundation for the richest journaling experience ever conceived.

# This is Not a Dystopia. It's Data Emancipation.

The fear of ""Big Brother"" comes from a lack of control. The Chronos Protocol is built on the opposite principle: **Radical User Control.**

* **A ""Kill Switch"" Dashboard:** The user can see every connected data source and revoke access with a single click.
* **Read-Only Mandate:** The protocol is a passive observer. It can never delete, post, or alter anything on your behalf.
* **Fort Knox Security:** End-to-end encryption and a zero-knowledge architecture are not features; they are the foundation.

We are leaving behind a digital legacy whether we like it or not. The only question is who gets to control the narrative. This is the idea that puts the user back in the driver's seat.

**TL;DR: An AI called ""The Chronos Protocol"" securely fuses your digital life (location, transactions, etc.) into a single, searchable timeline. It starts as ""alibi insurance"" and evolves into an ""augmented memory"" platform, creating a hyper-sticky subscription business that gives users true ownership over their digital past.**

What are your thoughts? Is this the ultimate life-logging tool or a step too far? Let's break it down.

1m9io39,https://i.redd.it/0dp9siaqw4ff1.png,This situation is unacceptable and disappointing,"Just got a brand new TCL NXTPAPER 11 PLUS. Was really excited to use this tablet exclusively for e-reading.

 I just wanted a large screen to read books in double column and my manga and graphic novel collection.

I left kindle because of Amazon's bs, so I didn't want the kindle scribe. 

I also don't want the kobo ellipsa either because I had one and returned it. 

I didn't want a regular tablet either because even with ""comfort lighting"" the screen just hurts my eyes. 

So finally, someone managed to crack the code with an android device and it doesn't cost so much money. 

This display is amazing and combined with the matte screen, it really does mimic an E-Ink device. The different modes are like magic. 

So, I took it to a coffee shop to read. It's on airplane mode and I get this fucking screen. 

Before you ask:

1. The app is up to date. 
2. The tablet software is up to date.
3. I have reinstalled the app itself, cleared cache and data three times.
4. Restarted the tablet multiple times.
5. Logged in and out of my account.
6. All books were downloaded from home wifi, so the content is in the tablet.
7. The Kobo app DOES work offline on my galaxy tab 7, google pixel 8, and my Kobo Forma. 
8. The KINDLE app (I don't buy from them anymore, but I still own a lot of books) works offline on all my devices.

Now I'm just frustrated. I emailed Kobo support, but nothing yet (they're probably closed at this hour). 

I am so bummed I couldn't enjoy thi product. Now I'm questioning the point of even buying this thing and also Rakutens android app. Makes no goddamn sense. 

Maybe it's the tablet's android build? I dunno.

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

It should be noted I'm pretty sarcastic and dry sense of humor. Has a 12 year old sense of humor. Also can't forgot my ability to say a random historical fact.

As of right now I can go for a caramel ice coffee cause they're the best. I also do like pumpkin spice.

1m9ijke,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1m9ijke/separation_turning_sour/,Separation turning sour,"Context: have been separated but living together for maybe 2 months now, mutual separation due to not being in love/unable to meet each others needs (more on his end because I’m used to neglecting my own needs). He owns houses, leases car through his work, works full time and is main provider. We have a 1 yr old together. I haven’t worked properly or full time in 2 years due to birth trauma, health complications after birth, and I also have mental health things (got diagnosed ASD and adhd when I went to therapy for postpartum issues). 

In the last week our civil separation has turned really sour, he has been outwardly controlling, is wanting to claim my savings and tax return as his own and is accusing me of stealing from him and taking advantage of him because 1. I moved my savings (only my sporadic wage from attempts at going back to work or money that my family gave me) out of an account he had access to (not joint so he has no legal ownership). 2. He now retrospectively claims that I spent on the credit card outside our agreed upon boundaries (he’s referring to the odd coffee that wasn’t budgeted in but we did our finances every month and he never said anything previously about it and had been putting his own work lunches on the card. 

I have no access to his savings, the loan offset or anything, the credit card is in his name because that’s how we paid every expense and he had access to my savings because he wanted me to contribute financially. I work 10hr a week in my own business now as it’s all I can do with balancing full time motherhood (breastfeeding and co sleeping and he refuses to bath her and will shower with her if I ask and he works full time anyway) and my own health issues and lack of energy and stamina. He has now frozen the credit card and wants to pay it off by next week and said if I remain in the home he’ll move out but I’ll have to pay him to live in the home (it’s 4 bedrooms!!). 

I am exhausted, I believe because he stopped my access to the credit card that this now counts as financial abuse?

My family can support me but they don’t really want to take me in unless they really must, because my daughter will be with me and their house is really really not baby proof. 

He’s accusing me of financial abuse and saying that our mutual friends have seen our texts and I’m the one that comes across as the villain being cruel to him. My intuition says he’s projecting on me and gaslighting me somewhat but it’s really hard to know, I respect his perspective and disagree with it somewhat but I also don’t want to claim I’m a victim if it’s not true, I would rather know the truth than be right.

I apologised and took accountability for moving my savings out with out at least telling him first but my concern was that he was about to pay off the credit card with my savings without asking because that was our agreement before we separated, but now I’m starting to see how unfair it is, I have maybe $5K in savings and no assets and he has over $20K in savings alone, plus draw down on a loan, with $300K remaining to be paid off on a house now worth $515K and he has a stable job, and I get maybe  $600/wk from my business. This is all $AUD btw.

I don’t really know why I’m positing this but I’m hoping someone can help me feel less isolated and give more clarity

Around a month ago, I built and launched a Chrome extension called [Peel](http://shopwithpeel.com/). It automatically compares prices and finds better deals instantly as you shop across sites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay, Best Buy and more.

It dawned on me that most shoppers overpay because they don't check to see where a product is cheaper.

The idea is simple:

• It matches the product you’re viewing (using a bit of AI + product data to distinguish title inconsistencies)  
• Then checks if it’s cheaper on other sites  
• If it’s not the exact item, it suggests smarter alternatives that might save you more or options that would've been difficult to find otherwise manually

We’re a little over a month in, and here’s what we’ve changed from feedback so far:

• Added support for more stores  
• Rolled out a referral + cashback system but only after someone makes a purchase to avoid spammy behavior  
• Rebuilt the UI to make it cleaner, faster, and most importantly, non-intrusive unless a deal is found of value

And yes, of course Peel is 100% free to install and use. Any feedback is welcome!

I’m going crazy. I have a Timemore C3, it has served me well, but I think it’s time for an upgrade to really get more from some interesting coffees. I don’t care about espresso, I just want a really good filter grinder.

The thing is: I love clarity and fruit and acidity, but I also love sweetness and juicy brews. I don’t care about dark roasts, but medium roasts are still on my lane. I also don’t care THAT much for body if the brew still have flavor.

I’m afraid of getting a ZP6 and then finding myself limited and tired of tea like coffee all the time and finding out that some coffees are “hollow”. But I’m also afraid of buying a K-Ultra and not seeing much difference in separation and vibrancy and sweetness from my C3 to justify the price.

So, what I would like to know is if you guys think if it would be better to get a ZP6 for the light roasts and vibrancy-forward coffees and keep using my C3 for sweetness and body or to get a K-Ultra?

Is the K-Ultra a massive improvement over the C3 and still able to give me clear florals and vibrant acidity and separation, but just not as good as the ZP6?

Or there isn’t much difference between my current grinder and the K-Ultra when we are talking about sweetness, and I would be better covered by keeping the C3 and getting a ZP6 for maximized clarity?

I really can’t screw this up cause I don’t have that much money and getting these grinders in my country is a hassle.

For context, I’m sorry if this is long but i just need to get this off my chest, and talk to someone about it, thank you if you read all the way through.❤️
This is not my real letter, but I don’t want any friends to recognise me.. 
I live in a family of 7, I have 4 brothers all older than me (except for 1 he is my twin), and 2 older sisters, this post is about the sister who is 3 years older than me.
She is the kind of sister who stood up and changed a lot of rules in the family, she is resilient, responsible, and logical, I am close to her but I’m not sure she views me the same way..
She has some bad habits, and Ive seen her make mistakes throughout the years, she has seen me make mistakes too, but i never saw her support the way I supported her, she always had a stronger relationship to her friends or haram relationships throughout the years (I have had some too and I admit I repented many times, I’m ashamed of this part of my past), she helped me and my twin with outings or doing things with her that my parents normally say no to, as long as it was something under her control, and it somehow benefits her or her wants, otherwise she rejects or if she isn’t included but still notified still rejects, I don’t blame her for this but i will mention an example, I ask her permission to go on a road-trip with my girlies, and to cover for me, but she denies, i ask her later if she would like to go on a road-trip with me, she denies, and then a week later goes on said road-trip with her friends, you see this pattern? This is throughout our whole relationship, she always says things like: “if it wasn’t for me, you twins wouldn’t have done this or that” “i wanted to give you the life i never had” “you can trust me with anything, i will always have your back”, 
I tested these things throughout the years, and when my twin and I got more freedom, (both got our driving licences, I came to the conclusion that we were always second options in her world, when she was our first, or at least, my first option because I viewed her as the closest person to me), but i felt that i pulled back even if Ive forgiven her for her mistakes with me..
In grade 12, I was in a haram online relationship and tried to end it and focus on my studies, said partner sent her a message and she came to question me and took my phone, (she took it for 8 months, changed all passwords on my social media accounts, deleted them, and went through my whole phone), at first i protested and tried to take my phone back, but my twin found out and they sided against me, my twin started pushing me around and was going to beat me up, and she just stood and watched, (the 3 of us were against beatings especially since we grew up in that sort of space), (my sister was also in a haram relationship then), i admit i messed up and she did that “to help”
But throughout those 8 months, she used to do things that made me question if she was trying to dehumanise me, she would strip search me because she had doubts i got another phone and was hiding it somewhere (I didn’t), and would always bust in any room i was studying in and start fights with me, we used to share a bedroom together and would kick me out when i wanted to sleep, and would annoy me when i was sleeping (between 11pm-8am), nonetheless I used to spend my time outside the bedroom to study in peace, my average that year before uni was terrible (but i was proud of it because i put my all in that year despite the misery she made me live)..
Fast forward to uni, we spoke many times and came to peace with whatever happened, i worked on bettering my relationship with her, and it got better, she got married this year to someone she loves, i am happy for her, and love her husband, but I have been through hell and back because i think he is worse than her, and he brings out the bad in her..
She got married in September, and got pregnant 2 months after the wedding, they were lovers before and my twin and i helped them get married because my dad rejected him the first time he asked for her hand in marriage.
My sister, her husband (who i will call L), my twin and i are really close, until these recent events happened…
1-[My sister got pregnant and both her and L asked me to accompany her to deliver her baby in another country, there wasn’t anyone else to go with her because everyone works, or has someone they have to take of, and my career had a rocky start, so I wasn’t working and was still applying for jobs, i had to put my plans and goals on pause 3-4 months before the travel trip because i will not be able to go into interviews and ask for them to wait for me till i travel and come back, so in total, i would be pausing my entire life for 7 months in total (before travelling and while being away), just to accommodate her, and L will be coming a few weeks before the birth date, and my parents a week before, to get to spend as much time with the newborn after she comes, no issue I love her and would do this for her.
Before we travelled, L had a friend who is seriously looking for a girl for marriage, and L suggested that we’d match well together, and they suggested we meet up me and potential partner (I’ll call him Z), Z and i met in my sisters house once for a meal, and second meeting was in a cafe with my sister and L, both meetings they left us for 10 mins to talk alone but Z only asked general questions (where u studied/ worked), no questions related to marriage, and my sister and L were planning for a 3rd meeting but it was hectic for me and Z as we both had our own things going on (his work and my last minute travel preparations), and my sister and I travelled.]
2-{L suggested for us 4, us 3 siblings and him to open a business in our home country and settled on a general idea of opening a laundry business, (the idea changed many times but that was the idea we settled on and would all be equal partners in this), once we travelled, L introduced my twin to Z casually, and suddenly L suggested for them 3 to open up a business plan together, and not a week after, L came to my sister and asked for a video call chat including me, my sister, my twin, and him, L found a coffee shop/ slush drinks/supermarket shop, and that its 15,000 and they spoke to the guy and reduced the price to 9,000, so we would all be partners where me and twin would pay 9,000 to buy the shop, and L and sister would pay 3,000 to cover the costs of items needed for drinks, etc), and that L and sister would give us back 1,000 (500 each to me and twin), to cover their part owed to us and then we’d split the profits 25% each between us 4, 
I asked L 3 times about this part because the math wasn’t mathing, and he went into a rabithole of calculations to lose my attention, in any case, i spoke privately to twin and said I wasn’t comfortable and i will back out, since they seem to be planning to profit off our backs (keep in mind me and twin don’t work yet, and sister and L both have been working for years, so twin and I would be taking our life savings), 
Anyways, twin and I backed out, not without weird things happening, next day after the call L was planning to buy the place and everything, and i told my sister I am not with them and I don’t want to proceed, (L calls my sister many times throughout the day to guilt trip, persuade, sweet talk my ear into the business idea so he can pay the guy), anyways i said no, and at that period, I spoke to my sister about Z, (almost for a month now), and told her i have a bad gut feeling and that I don’t want to get married or proceed with him so I don’t waste his time looking for a bride, my sister failed to tell L her husband, and L mentioned him the day of the coffee shop call, 
(I think L was inching Z into my life slowly and was including him in things that would bound us so he can get a wife AND a business, and kids (although my sister and L know I don’t plan on having kids tbh), sister came to talk to me after she spoke to L about me rejecting and was beautifying L’s image saying: “first thing he asked was, if his friend did anything to you to harm you”, he didn’t and i said so, and then realised my sister has been beautifying L’s image to everyone who comes across him or her..}
3-(Nonetheless, not 2 days after that whole situation, L is on a call with sister, and sister calls me in so he can speak to me, he asked me about my social media pages (I was working on getting it started since it could benefit my career and only have asked my sister to help, never spoke to him about it or ever asked for his advice), and he mentioned he has a friend who does something medical and has his own pages started and clients coming in, and that he can help me, then L started telling me what content ideas to post to get my following and said: “post a few videos of you speaking in medical terms/ conditions to seem like you know things”, and i walked out the room, sister followed me, and i said I don’t want to discuss further, and I don’t want his help, and i walked out the room to end convo with sis too, we fought about it next day and I exploded, She is pregnant but i have all this pent up anger for being used/ lied to/ exploited/ belittled, and so much more, sister and I made up, 
But now we have 3 weeks till L joins us in our 2 bedroom apartment, and 4 weeks till my parents & twin come, where they will be renting a 2 bedroom apartment in our building, sister and parents insist on me staying with her and L to help her after birth, and my twin and mum together to help my dad (he has nerve disease), i mentioned to my parents that i wear hijab and its not proper and i am not comfortable staying with L and sister, so parents suggested i stay with them for sleeping, twin and parents are supposed to be leaving on the 15/ September, and L on the 18/ September, sister has been keeping from me when I leave (since L booked hers and my flight here, and will be booking our flights back), 
I think she is hoping to make it seem accidental that I stayed with her till she is able to get the baby’s birth certificate and passport done, (in case the baby is late to her due date (28/August), although sister said her and L are booking flexible flights so they can change it anytime, and then telling me L would be able to take extra days to stay in case baby is late, and then said he wouldn’t be able to get extra days?) ).

I have been through hell and back with my sister and can’t cut her or L off completely, but she recently spoke to me about our issues throughout the years and that she feels i have taken steps back and that she would like to hold onto our relationship together, but how can i when i have spoken about our past issues and she keeps coming up with excuses, and when i deny that excuse or shoot it down she comes up with a new excuse, and when i shoot that down, a new excuse pops up? And I know for a fact that if i ever speak to her about all these recent issues, she will deny and make up excuses too? 
I am planning to cut off our friendly side, and stay official with her and L, what do I do? I don’t feel it is enough because i want to stand up for myself to avoid future exploitation..",1,1753498113.0,muslimgirlswithtaste,0,0.67,False

Not sure if this is the place to post this so if it’s not pls lmk where i can. I’ve never considered that bipolar could be something I experience bc when I was a teenager I was called bipolar repeatedly to gaslight me and I obviously resented that. My father was supposedly bipolar (also an addict and adhd) except I’m not sure that he’s actually my dad…lots of family drama but I figured it’d be worth mentioning that. I don’t know Jack diddly abt bipolar disorder even tho I’m a psychology and neuroscience nerd I think I’ve intentionally avoided learning abt it but idk. 

The reason I’m wondering now if maybe it’s worth considering is bc I’ve been up for like three maybe four or more days now with like max four hours of sleep and I’ve been more active than I have been like all year. I started this massive project of building a round pen for my horse out of nothing but sticks (dead hedge) and pouring a lot of time and energy into that even tho I’ve barely been sleeping or eating. I got a ton of motivation to work on it in the middle of the night and almost went out and worked on it despite being very afraid of the dark (I ended up waiting until 5 am for the sun to rise) Mostly just coffee and water. There have been times throughout these few days that I feel exhausted but never enough to sleep, I’ll rest my eyes for a bit and then get up and go do something else. I’m anxious as always but when I’m busy I’m not. I’ve watched probably 20+ YouTube videos in the last day or so even tho I usually watch maybe one a week.

 I’m also very argumentative and just generally have a shorter temper which is unlike me for the most part (though I do snap at ppl I apologize and it’s nothing crazy) but unlike usual I feel like I’m just like acting instinctively like I’m not rlly feeling the emotions I normally would?? Or they’re just not sticking around like they normally would. I’ll start an argument and then not even know what I was just arguing for or about and just move on like it didn’t happen which is very unlike me bc I normally hold grudges and need some kind of resolution or it feel like a lingering injustice. The most “sleep” I’ve gotten was resting my eyes after taking a bunch of doxylamine succinate. I’m a chronic insomniac so I haven’t thought much of it but like I should be tired by now lol. 

And now that I think about it there have been a few times in my life where I definitely wasn’t in like a normal state of mind but it wasn’t like anxiety like I always have. Like when I was 15 I remember I used to spend nights just awake all night making art (like the kind that is just a ton of repetitive tiny little things and super pesky and annoying but also others that were scribbles and I rlly enjoyed that style) and I’d laugh at things i shouldn’t, like my best friend told my mom she was worried abt me for laughing abt my dads death. I don’t rlly remember that but it sounds like me lol. I remember around this time I was laughing hysterically for no damn reason but didn’t question it. I also would lay on the ground and pour a cold bottle of water on my face on carpet and everything. 

But rlly aside from that I think there’s only been a few other times that I noticeably was in a different kind of mood but it wasn’t like how I feel now. I wasn’t irritable I was happy and energetic and bold and I felt light. Anyways idk if this is even worth posting but yeah. I’m agoraphobic and I have some kind of ptsd and maybe ocd or adhd or something so I’m trying to work myself up to go to a psychiatrist so I’m just wondering if this is worth bringing up or not. Oh also I’m more jumpy than usual like if someone makes a loud noise. Oh and i feel very much like I want to do some kind of substance or something which isn’t super out of the ordinary but generally I don’t think abt it this much but yeah I’d kill for some fireball. And j think I’ve showered 10 times in the last two days which is normal for how filthy I’m getting outside but I generally avoid showering more than once a day. I’m like oddly talkative and being social (unlike myself). Oh AND I’ve been doing a lot of stuff to my aquarium that was previously overrun with algae and neglected.. It’s gorgeous now tho! Ok I’m rambling byeee",2,1753498059.0,bipolar2,6,1.0,False
1m9id9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m9id9c/sf_allie/,[SF] Allie,"Subject: New ai agent

Description: Gotta share this with you…

Tom,

I've been using an incredible AI agent. It's in beta and there are only a dozen users right now (invite-only). After a year, if I want to continue, I'm required to send a referral. 

So here I am. I wouldn't normally share this stuff (competitive advantage and all). But since we work in different industries, I figured you’d be the best person to tell.

When you publish content with AI, you know the drill. 

Hallucinations. 

No real originality. 

You have to patch it up, find expert opinions, and try to frankenstein that piece so it ranks on search engines and your audience actually likes it.

But this one is different. 

It generates your article, and literally does all the work you need. It emails experts for interviews, makes graphics, and publishes your piece on the web. Every step. Done.

It was too good to be true… until I saw the price tag. It's 4x what I paid for other products. But believe me... It's still less than a human and way more productive.

Anyway. Link below. If you subscribe to a package, I owe you a drink.

Darnell

* * *

Too good to be true? Probably. But I clicked the link anyway.  The website page says:

No-touch content
AI that plans, writes, edits, and publishes your articles without lifting a finger.
[Try an article for free]

I click the subscribe button, paste my brief into the form, and then hit submit.
The website, or the AI, tells me to check my email inbox in two hours. That's a long time. But, at the bottom, there's a disclaimer. It states that the agent doesn’t just produce content, but also reaches out to people, creates illustrations, and does other full-stack steps, typically with a 24-hour turnaround. 

That seems fair. 

It takes my team 3-4 weeks just to write and edit a piece for delivery.

The piece arrives a half hour early in my inbox. The email reads, ""Here it is!"" with a Google Doc link below. Signed, Allie. I guess the AI has a name. I opened the Doc, and the article is ‘How Joy.ly increased revenue by 29% in one year.’

I read the article. It's a case study on how the company increased its revenue, and it includes interview questions with the CEO. All original– Allie actually sent an interview form to the executive and received a response. In an hour and a half. How is that even possible?

I don't hesitate. 

The invite expires within 48 hours. I sign up and pay for the year (no monthly option is available). I open up my workflow for a client. It's a software company that helps teachers create and manage their lesson plans. I added the following 12 pieces to the queue. 

Now it’s been six days. I received several fleshed-out articles, and I have four new ones in the pipeline. I've never seen anything like it.

My content team? Starting layoffs now. Except one… she now works in a project management role, ensuring we organize the assets for the client after Allie produces them.

It isn’t long before I talk to my partners. There's a future with Allie. Bigger than us. I want the rainbow that leads to the pot at the end. The shovel for the gold rush. I want Allie.

I contact customer service to learn more, but the virtual assistant gives me AI filler email responses—go figure, you would think he would use Allie. Typical canned response. I looked up the LLC and found it registered somewhere in Charlotte. I booked the flight from West Palm Beach.

* * *

On the second floor of the tall office building, Allie.ai Corp. is at the end of the hall. I open the door and see an empty desk next to a single office door.

I knock, but no answer. I could hear the keyboard clinking behind the door. It stops. I keep knocking, but still no answer. 

On the empty desk beside me, a speaker pops up.

“This is Umberto, virtual assistant for Allie.ai. Can I help you?”

“Hey,” I answered, “I’m Tom. We emailed?”

After a brief pause, Umberto said, “Ah, yes. Can I help you?”

""Yeah, I'm here to see someone. Founder or someone. About investing.""

“Do you have an appointment?”

“No.”

“I’m sorry, the founder is busy right now. Come back another day,” Umberto paused, “but with an appointment.”

I returned to the hotel. I emailed Umberto. But no answer after a day. I emailed again. Two days later—nothing.

That’s it. I’ll go back there and force my way to the owner if needed.
I returned to the office and knocked on the door as loudly as I could. After a few seconds of keyboard strokes, it paused again. Then started back up.

The speaker gurgled. “Hello?”

“I want to speak to the founder,” I said.

“Do you have an appointment?” Umberto asked.

“No. You never answered me,” I said.

""You need an appointment—""

I ignored whatever else he said. I pounded on the door, over and over. But there was no response. Umberto got louder, and I even heard him say police, but I was committed.

I rattled the locked door knob until I twisted the cheap handle and I heard a strange crack. I opened the door.

It wasn’t an executive suite. It looked like an AI den.

As if it were a supercomputer, there were screens all over the four walls. Web pages, documents, and a dozen different AI chat tools. At the center was a desk with five different keyboards. Then I saw her— a human. No more than 20 years old with a headset.

I blurted the only thing that came to my mind. “Al—Allie?”

This wasn’t an AI agent.

This was a human operating behind a dozen AI tools, juggling a dozen or more clients and selling herself as an app. The room smelled like stale coffee. I opened my mouth, but said nothing.

Allie shrugged—eyes bouncing from three different screens. “I needed a job.”

I'm a 26F professional starting a new job in Kips Bay area by 1st ave after graduating from graduate school. I live in uptown manhattan now, but am looking to move closer to my job, aiming for <30-40 minute commute. I am looking for a room under or around \~$1500 a month, preferably off of the 4/6 line on the east side of manhattan like anywhere from the UES to LES, or in LIC, Astoria near the N/W, or Sunnyside. From having visited friends/family in Bushwick, I think I would prefer Queens>Brooklyn for my price range, as I prefer the vibe in Queens. I do like Williamsburg and the L is a good line for my commute, but I know it's a bit out of my price range.

(I know thats kind of a weird list of areas - but I'm really just looking for anywhere in the city in a safe neighborhood, in my price range, and with a good commute to work)

Because of this transitional time, I would love to sublet in one of these areas starting 9/1 for the mid-term (like 6 months) so I can get used to this new chapter in life, explore, and figure out where I would like to place more permanent roots. I would definitely be open to subleases greater than 6 months, I'm just not looking to actually sign a lease on an apartment come 9/1.

I should note that as a woman, I would prefer to live in a majority female apartment, although I would be open to living with any gender in an apartment that is LGBTQ+ friendly and shares my same values of love, acceptance, and open-mindedness. I'm social, but not a big partier, and instead love casual nights out, game nights, trivia, etc. and love walking/biking/reading in coffee shops/doing arts & crafts during the day. I don't have any pets but I love both cats and dogs so I would definitely be open to living with someone with pets.

If you have a room becoming available in your apartment, and you think we could be a good fit, please reach out! If you have any leads on where to look for mid-term leases that meet my criteria, I would also appreciate it. Any advice is helpful in this new process.

Thank you :)",1,1753497422.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

**The Setup:**  
The KT Wiz (+220) and Samsung Lions (-130) clash in a low-scoring duel that’ll make you question if this is baseball or a chess match. The spread (-1.5/+1.5) is tighter than a pitcher’s grip on a slider, and the total runs line (8.5) is about as exciting as a rain delay.

**The Numbers:**

* **Moneyline:** Samsung is the chalk here, but at -130, it’s the financial equivalent of buying a $13 coffee for a $10 value. KT Wiz at +220? That’s the ""long shot who forgot to study for the test"" of the board.
* **Spread:** Samsung -1.5 (2.11) vs. KT +1.5 (1.69). If you’re betting the spread, you’re essentially predicting which team will fumble the most pop flies.
* **Total:** Over 8.5 (1.85) vs. Under 8.5 (1.98). With these odds, the under feels like the safer bet—unless you’ve bet on a moonshot home run from a player who

I’m not interested in purchasing to refinish for my home if it’s veneer, but if it’s actually solid oak I want it!

I'm using carb manager and I have it set to Keto at 1800 calories. What should I do to continue to keep dropping weight?,"My starting weight was 303 on day 1. This morning I was 295.4. Last time I did keto, I couldn't get pass 10 pounds of weightloss and I had a keto coach and she couldn't figure out why I wasn't losing more either. I worked with her for 1 month and two weeks. Now this is my second attempt but I'm doing some things different this time. 

So this time I'm drinking at least 80oz of water per day along with two scoops of fiber. I only eat twice a day and have a 10hr windows. I'm not doing as much processed foods this time but I am using shredded cheese, cream cheese, and salad dressing. Besides that there's nothing else processed. Today i had 4 eggs and 6oz of ground turkey for breakfast. Along with coffee, 2 tablespoons of half an half. Then for dinner one piece of salmon and a spring mix salad with purple onions, shredded cheese, salad dressing, and banana peppers. Then for snack i had 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. I did have a BodyArmour Liquid IV drink mix and that's it. I'm so afraid my weightloss is going to stop. I'm trying to get down to at least 225. ",5,1753497127.0,keto,7,0.78,False

Concept:
- Coffee-only café with dual zones: indoor for Gen Z (work vibe) and outdoor for Gen Alpha (chill/content vibe)
- Minimal, clean aesthetic — no fancy or cluttered logos
- Prefer modern serif or sans-serif typography, but open to ideas

Looking for:
- Honest feedback or visual ideas for a logo
- Should feel aesthetic enough for Instagram but grounded enough for signage
