1pxdz0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1pxdz0i/aio_or_was_this_group_dynamic_genuinely_harmful/,AIO or was this group dynamic genuinely harmful? (Looking for outside perspective),"I’m looking for some outside perspective on a situation that has been weighing on me for weeks. I’ll try to keep this as factual and concise as possible.

I’m in a relationship with someone I care about deeply. We went through a difficult phase recently but worked on our communication and things between us improved. Shortly after that, his close friend group (including his best friend and roommates) became noticeably cold toward me.

Concrete behaviors:

	•	Not saying hello or acknowledging me

	•	Avoiding eye contact

	•	Refusing help without explanation

	•	Dismissive responses (e.g., no “thank you” when I brought food)

	•	Leaving rooms without saying goodbye

	•	Making me feel invisible in shared spaces

This shift was abrupt. A month earlier, interactions were normal and friendly.

I tried to assume it wasn’t personal and continued being polite and kind, bringing things about the bakery ect., but the behavior intensified. During this time, I was already emotionally vulnerable (family crisis, holidays, isolation), which made the impact worse.

My partner eventually noticed and acknowledged that their behavior was not okay. He spoke directly to his best friend during Christmas, explained that their behavior hurt him because it hurt me, and asked him to send me a message to apologize. His friend said he would- but never did. My partner followed up multiple times; the messages were not opened, or non-answered, then completely avoided.

Later, the friend said:

	•	He had no malice toward me

	•	He “respects me because I’m his friend’s girlfriend”

	•	He wouldn’t go for coffee or have a relationship with me independently

	•	He perceived me as someone who “always wants to explain or be right” (my partner defended me, explaining I’m autistic/ADHD and that this isn’t intentional)

So essentially: no apology, no direct communication, and a framing that shifted focus to my personality rather than the behavior.

My partner has since acknowledged:

	•	The silence and avoidance were not okay

	•	His friend’s lack of response is a choice

	•	The group is very closed and conflict-avoidant

	•	He fears losing them because they’re his primary social support

	•	He understands why I need distance and supports that boundary

	•	He wants to build something with me, even though he still believes their actions weren’t intentionally meant to hurt me (but were immature and protective of him)

Where I’m struggling:

	•	The exclusion felt like social punishment rather than a misunderstanding

	•	Any “nice intentions” toward me are communicated through my partner, never directly

	•	I feel pressured to re-enter the group without any repair

	•	The silence feels like accountability avoidance

	•	I’ve developed anxiety/rumination from the prolonged uncertainty

**Am I overreacting due to stress, or responding proportionately to exclusion?**

I’m especially interested in perspectives from people who’ve experienced group dynamics, social exclusion, or boundary-setting in relationships.

1pxdyh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pxdyh4/disappearances_in_a_strange_town_short_story/,Disappearances in a strange town - [short story],"PART ONE.

Out of all the places I've went to over the years, this has to be one of the strangest. It always feels like the people here always know something you don't, even if the knowledge is foolish. Most of them are old tales of ghosts that spread from a child's bedroom at a sleepover and were eventually told by grandparents beside a campfire.

Like the story of Jacob Miller who was ten years old in 1996 who was woken up late at night by the sound of rustling outside, he thought it was a raccoon or possum so he went to check his window and all he saw was a ""messy looking face"", before he could even react it was gone. 

Or the story of Heather Morgan who was thirteen in 1994 who went camping with her family in the local Falls Forest, her older sister who was sixteen, was acting odd all day, apparently she'd stare aimlessly into the distance like she saw something nobody else could. The next day when morning came, her sister was nowhere to be found, but her coat and shoes were left in her tent. even after the police searched and searched for her, they found nothing.

So many stories surrounding this town, most of them made up ghost stories. Some I believe to be connected to disappearances that have occurred within the last 11 years. Fiction and reality is a strange blur in this town, but not for me.

I'm a detective, been one for what feels like most of my life, the year is 1999 and the streetlights outside my motel room are dim, much like the people in this town. Minds full of dreams of ghouls and spirits wandering the world, meanwhile my mind is full of the faces found on missing person posters.

Speaking of dreams, it's getting late and I've got an early day tomorrow.

PART TWO.

It's currently December, snow hasn't fallen yet. I see Christmas decorations in the windows of family homes and local stores. This town is old and claustrophobicly small, it feels like everyone knows everyone here. It's early morning, I leave my cramped motel room and lock the door behind me as I walk towards my old 1993 chevrolet caprice that's been worn down over the years, much like myself.

As I begin to unlock my car a man on the second floor of the motel waves to me as if he knows me. I'd say he was in his fortys, a couple years older than myself. 

""mornin friend"" 
He said with a carefree tone as he yelled down at me, he had the look of a man who's only ever known the good in others.

""mornin'."" 
I say with no enthusiasm for this to become a conversation 

""You best be careful on the roads, startin' to get icy now"" 
He said with a laugh before he continued,
""Meant to be snowing by the end of the week"" 

""Thanks for tellin' me."" 
I said with a wave as I got into my car, shutting the door and lighting up a cigarette before starting the engine.

The drive into town took no more than twenty minutes, the motel sat near the edge of town, with the forest that surrounded the town all around it. Driving on winding roads surrounded by looming trees. No wonder it's so easy for people to disappear here, or to be taken without a trace. Everyone here seems to think the disappearances are paranormal, some think it's long dead friends calling to the living, some think it's an evil spirit tempting people away and back into nature.

I think neither, I think it's some godforsaken lunatic who's been killing people. I know no bodies have been found, nor a trace of them. But I feel it, I know it. Even when for lack of a better word, they've fallen off the face of the earth. 

I'm going to talk to a man today, he's the grandad of a boy that went missing eight months ago I don't know the details yet but I will soon.

I park outside the mans house, I toss my cigarette before walking up the steps to the front door and ring the bell, a short elderly man opens it. He looks like the stereotypical grandpa. in his seventies I'd say.

""Thanks for meeting me so early Mr Greyshore""
I said to the man as I shook his hand

""Ah don't thank me, better early than late.""
He said as we sat down at the livingroom table

I took a breath ""could you describe to me what happened? On the nineteenth of April?""

Mr Greyshore looked down slightly before looking back at me, he inhaled deeply before replying 

""Of course, it was a normal day. Until it happened. My grandson was staying here for the night while his father was busy with work. Young Hunter was playing on his games in the evening, I don't understand all that stuff"" he said with a small chuckle

""I had a dog you see, Benny was his name. I could swear Hunter loved that dog even more than myself. All at a sudden I heard Hunter screaming that the dogs gone, I said he must be hiding but thats when I heard him barking from outside. I thought I was hearing things for a second, because the last time I saw Benny he was upstairs. He couldn't of gotten outside without me or Hunter seeing him""
Mr Greyshore placed his palm on his forehead as he sighed, with a deep look of regret on his face, as if every tragedy was upon his shoulders, weighing him down.

""Mr Greyshore, what happened next?"" 
I said in a low gentle tone

""Yes, sorry"" he cleared his through before continuing 

""Hunter ran down the stairs, asked me if I heard Benny too, I said yes of course and told him to wait inside while I go fetch him. He wanted to come with me course, but I made sure he stayed inside and waited. So I locked the backdoor behind me as I stepped outside, before going out into the woods""

Mr Greyshore glanced to the window, it looked like he saw something for a split second, before he turned back to me and continued talking

""It was dark, darkest I've ever seen it. I yelled Benny's name over and over. He didn't come, I looked all over for him, tried to keep going but the darkness just kept growing, and Benny wasn't barking. So I went home, thought maybe he'd find his way back, I wasn't too worried, strong old dog. Besides, not been a bear nor stag in those woods for decades, so I didn't need to worry about him getting attacked by something""

Poor man, he was trying so hard to avoid speaking of the conclusion to that day. I could see it in his eyes so clearly, but I sadly couldn't allow that.

""What happened when you came home Mr Greyshore?"" 

took a deep breath, before speaking ""when I came back, I saw-""
He stuttered, his voice was shaky as he continued ""the backdoor, it was wide open. I ran inside as fast as I could, shouted for Hunter, I looked everywhere in my house and-"" 
Mr Greyshore was barely holding himself together at this point, yet even so. He continued on ""he was gone, just like all the others. No trace or anything! Just fuckin' gone!"" He was starting to shout, as tears formed in his eyes.

""It's not your fault, Mr Greyshore. Nothing that's happened here, is your fault.""
I was never good at comforting the grieving, but I had to try.

I stood up from the chair, I began to walk to the frontdoor as I turned to the man and said ""if there's anything you need, or anything else that comes to light, please call me.""

I opened the front door before Mr Greyshore spoke again ""there was something"" he said without facing me ""it was left beside the backdoor about a week before Hunter went missing, a sculpture. I didn't know what it was. I just thought it was Hunter trying to be funny, maybe he saw something online. That's what I thought at the time at least.""

""Could you describe it?"" 
I asked quizzically 

""It was twigs, few of them all tied together with some kinda twine to form a pyramid. In the middle of it, there was a small piece of antler dangling from the tip of the pyramid""

""And what did you do with it?""

Mr Greyshore looked up at me, his face pale ""I destroyed it. Anytime I'd look at it, I'd get this feeling, this dark sense emanating from it, like it was something dangerous and connected to something much darker than even that forest at night."" 

""Take care of yourself, Mr Greyshore. Thank you for all of this, you've been a big help"" 

As I turned to go out the door, he spoke again. ""Don't go out into the woods at night.""

As I lit another cigarette, I thought to myself. Poor Mr Greyshore, he'd rather believe in supernatural lunacy and have an ounce of hope, than face the tragic reality, his grandson was kidnapped and was most likely dead. I don't know why children are being taken.

But I know this: there is nothing supernatural in this town.

PART THREE

This town, it's miles away from any city. It's an old rural town, a small one. Got a church, school and everything else you'd expect, from what I can tell It's the kind of place people go to raise a family, the kind of place I would've liked to raise my own family, I see parents and their kids following them down the street, only thing that's followed me in my life is tragedy. 

Every case in recent years it seems as if the local police in this town do the bare minimum, it's almost as if they expect that the kids will never be found. They do searches all over town, even in the woods and find nothing, they check cctv that only ever records grainy imaged of the streets at night, they talk to the grieving parents who know nothing but the fact that they want their child home and safe. It feels like the local police have become desensitised to it all, beaten down year by year, cold case by cold case until they've lost all hope of finding them.

It's like they think these kids have just ceased to exist.

I drive down the road, to the house of a girl who went missing around a month ago. There's two kids bikes leant against the front of the house next to the front door, one of which will most likely never be ridden again. You'd never expect such a horror had ever occurred at their house, a normal house with a normal family, undeservingly stricken with the most horrific of tragedies. I'm welcomed in by the mother of the two children, she looked dishevelled to say the least, yet still had the strength to keep himself together.

""Thanks for comin' detective"" 

""No, thank you for agreeing to this, Mrs Nichols""
I say as she leads me into the living room, she motions towards the arm chair across from the couch. She sat on the couch which had a small coffee table infront of it.

""I'm sorry my husband isn't here, he's out working. I've just started clearin' out the attic with my boy for the first time in years. Even if it's just trying to keep myself busy.""
Mrs Nichols said with a forced, shortlived laugh

""Don't worry about it. I know this is tough subject, but could you tell me everything you remember leading up to your daughter's disappearance?. On the seventh of November""

Mrs Nichols sat on the couch silently for a moment, composing herself before answering

""Yes. Yes, of course""

""Normal day, normal everythin' I guess until the end of it. The kids wanted to do an 'all nighter' as they called it, they'd been beggin' us for weeks about it, watch a film downstairs, eat popcorn and tell scary stories. Me and my husband finally decided to let them. We shouldn't of let them now that I look back on it.""
Mrs Nichols took a shaky breath, before continuing 

""She wouldn't of ran away, I'm tellin' you she wouldn't. Even if we left the doors unlocked, she wouldn't of been able to reach the door handles.""
Mrs Nichols began to cry, before inhaling deeply and continuing 

""My boy told me what he saw that night, haunts us all, probably will haunt us till we die. He told us he went to the bathroom, then when he went back into the livingroom, it was complete silence except for the static on the TV. He told me he thought she was playing hide and seek at first, then he realized the backdoor was wide open. I remember his scream, screamed for us saying she was taken by a monster. My husband ran outside while I called the police. Nobody found a damn trace of her, nothin!.""
Mrs Nichols fell silent, as tears began to fall down her face

""I'm sorry. If it's any consolation to you, I know what you're going through""

""You have a child?""
She asked in a somber tone

""Used to, yes""

""I'm so sorry""
She said softly

""Don't be, not your fault nor mine. Just some idiot who decided to drive home drunk out of his mind. I was at work when it happened, My wife was driving our son home from preschool one moment, then the next moment they were..""
I paused, before clearing my throat and continuing 

""Sorry, got off topic for a moment there. Anyway, is there anything else you know? Anything you've seen?"" 

""No, nothin'""

""Mom!!"" 
A voice shouted from upstairs, Mrs Nichols son Jamie

""Yes honey?!""
Mrs Nichols shouted back 

""What's this?
Jamie yelled before he started to come down the stairs 

""What's what?""
Mrs Nichols asked 

""This weird stick thing?"" 
Jamie said as he entered the living room, holding exactly what Mr Greyshore said he found before his grandson disappeared. It was just like he described, sticks in the shape of a pyramid, held together by twine. The same twine that connected to a piece of antler that was hanging from the top of the pyramid.

I was speechless, completely and utterly speechless. I was trying to come up with something to say before Mrs Nichols spoke 

""Maybe it's the old owners and we only just found it?"" Mrs Nichols said with a tinge of concern in her voice as Jamie put the stick pyramid down on the coffee table before running up the stairs again

""Something just like that found in someone else's home too, the home of a man who's grandson went missing eight months ago"" I paused for a moment ""don't touch it, I'll have someone come by and take it into evidence""

Mrs Nichols looked confused for a second before her eyes widened, realising what this meant. 

Someone is putting these in people's homes, most likely the person responsible for all the disappearances in the town. But how? They'd have to break in then get all the way up into the attic, it made no sense. Why'd they go through all the effort just for that?.

I still don't know why yet, but I know for certain now that there has to be someone doing all of this. I'm going to catch them, so that no other children are ripped away from their families.

FINAL PART.

I've been investigating for months now and I've made almost no progress. Nothing about this case makes any sense, honestly I'm starting to feel like maybe there's something wrong with me. Sometimes when I'm alone, in my motel room or driving my car, I feel like I'm not truly alone, like someone is watching me.
I'm having odd nightmares too. 
I see a door in a dark empty almost liminal room. I know this place, it's my old home from when my wife was alive.
One second the door is closed and in the next, it's wide open as darkness seeps in, it consumes me before trees and branches come into view through the shadows. 

Sometimes I wish I could be like the people here, if I was than maybe I could chalk it up to the universe giving me some kind of sign. But I can't do that, I wish I could dream of a fantastical reason for all the horrors in my life, but then I'd become lost in them. Drifting from one delusion to another in an infinite loop.

My boss called me, he's getting agitated by the lack of progress I've made in this case. He told me he's going to pull me off the case and put someone else onto if I don't find something quick. As if they'll find anything I haven't already found. Not even search dogs can get a trace of them. No footprints, no dna no nothing. It's like these kids have just been wiped from existence. 

It was around 1AM, it was starting to snow outside and I was smoking a cigarette as a read through police reports from old disappearances in the area, trying to connect them to the newer ones as I heard something at the door. Scratching like an animal trying to get in, maybe a raccoon or something. I got up as I put the cigarette into the ashtray before opening the door. It was a small brown dog, before I could check it's collar for a name tag or even get a decent look at the dog, it ran off around the back of the motel, before stopping to look back at me periodically, as if it wanted me to follow it. So I did, hoping I could get him inside incase it was someone's lost dog, hoping I could bring it home to its family, not disimilar to what I yearned to do for the families that live in this town, even though I knew it was impossible.

I walked towards to the dog, before it ran towards the forest. So I ran after it, I knew it was a mistake to go into that forest at night, yet I did it anyway. I chased it, deeper and deeper into the forest. Then I lost sight of it before it started to bark, over and over again it barked as I tried to find it, I followed the noise deeper into the forest, after a while I realized I had lost track of where I was, I could barely see anything. The snow was falling faster. 

Then I noticed something else, the barking sounded wrong somehow. One bark, a pause then two quick barks before repeating itself. Over and over again in that exact order, like it was a recording of a dog barking and it was set on loop. Something was terribly wrong here.

I turned around to run but then I saw a tree larger than any other that sat in the middle of a small clearing. It towered over the surrounding trees and its leafless branches gave it an almost skeletal appearance. The peak of the trunk split into two large branches that reached out to each side, while many smaller branches sprouted from atop them.

Then the barking stopped instantly, as if someone was flicking a switch. I walked towards the large tree, closer and closer as the snow started to swallow up the grass. As I got closer, I saw the dog curled up at the foot of the tree. It was dead and deep into decomposition. I could see part of its skull through its matted furr, I knelt down to check for a name tag, it had one.
The dogs name was Benny, it was Mr Greyshores dog.

I reach for my phone before I heard the crunch of snow being stepped on behind me. I quickly turn around and all I could see in the darkness was what looked to be a girl with long unkempt hair that went down past her waist, she started to move towards me but it was wrong, she was getting closer to me but she wasn't taking any steps, like a statue being pushed forward.

I ran as fast as I could, all I knew in that moment was that I had to get out of there, I knew there was nothing but the unexplainable in those woods. It took a while but I made myself back to the motel and got on the phone to the local police, I told them that there's a young girl in the forest that needs help, I also told them about the dog. They told me that they'd look into it and send people out there to look.

Then I called my boss, I tried explaining everything to him but he wouldn't listen to a word except for the part where I ran away from a supposed missing girl who was lost in a forest.
He told me I'm going to assist the local police in their search before I'm suspended for gross dereliction of duty.

We searched all over town and all around the forest for over a week straight. I even searched where I believed the large tree to be, I looked all over that area yet the tree, the dog and the girl were gone. Like every other search for a missing person, we found absolutely nothing.

I was fired after a weeks long suspension, I desperately tried explaining to my boss and anyone that would listen for even a minute that something wasn't right in that forest, I suppose they just assumed I had gone mad and brushed me off as deluded, so I was fired. My investigation meant nothing in the end.

That town, it's not normal. It's not right, it's not just disappearances it's something else, something I could never hope to explain or rationalise.

All I know is that you should never go into that forest. Not because you'll be kidnapped or murdered by some degenerate lunatic, but because there is something much worse in those woods. Like all the cases surrounding that place, it is something that will never be solved.",1,1766883889.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False
1pxdy14,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1pxdy14/warning_religious_themes_working_on_a_story_that/,WARNING : Religious themes. Working on a story that I can hopefully publish someday. Honest feed back greatly appreciated.,"“Good Afternoon, Blake”, Vivian said, as she took the seat closest to the hearth. “Hopefully you are feeling a little better today.”



“Feeling better?” Blake said incredulously. “Is this you trying to be hospitable?”



She looked at him pensively, then placed her purse and bible on the table before crossing her legs. “I get it Blake, it's one of those–”



“Why are you talking to me like you know me?” he interrupted, tapping his finger testily. “I know you don’t care sister, so don't pretend like you do. Let’s just do our time and go our separate ways.”







Vivian took a moment to close her eyes and take in a deep breath. This was going to be hard. The anger and self-loathing was palpable and emanated from the man like a furnace.



When she reopened her eyes, she took the time to assess the poor soul in front of her. He was a young man but a young man in age alone. Years of stress, excessive smoking, and all around poor self-maintenance gave him a disheveled look and a demeanor of one well beyond his years. His face, at one point, could have even been considered handsome by some; with his short dark hair and steel grey eyes, but in its current state it was a sunken and hopeless mess. Framing a face that was twisted with anger.



“‘Doing our time and going our separate ways’,” Vivian repeated, in a by-the-numbers tone, “What exactly do you mean by that?”



Blake raised an eyebrow and gave her a mocking look. “You think I’m here for the Sunday service and complimentary brunch?” He took a sip from his mug. “I'm here for the one thing worth being here for. And by his

grace you all are ready and willing to just divvy it out no questions asked.”



“Our financial aid.” Vivian said, nodding her head slowly in realization and disappointment.



“No strings attached.”



“There are strings, Mr. Blake.” Vivian replied calmly, hands clasped on her knees and leaning forward in her chair. “I don't know who took it upon themselves to make these wild claims but it would be my pleasure to explain it to you correctly.”



Blake paused in his seat; porcelain mug halfway to his lips. “You can’t fool me,” he muttered before emptying his cup. “I’ll go over your head and talk to Pastor whatever-his-name is if you won’t help me. Everyone knows you all are a bunch of bleeding hearts.”



“It’s a little early to be drinking isn’t it?” Vivian replied placidly, eyeing the now empty mug. “Something tells me there was more than just coffee in that cup.”



That made him chuckle.



“Why does that matter? Will it disqualify me?”



“Well I’m just getting to know you. This isn’t an interview or anything, just think of it as step one in the process of receiving our financial support.”



Blake sat up a little straighter in his chair, glaring at his empty cup as though it were some kind of troublesome family member.



“Yeah, I may have had a little pick me up this morning…or three.”



“Do you do that often?”



“For f\*cks sake woman, do you want my driver’s license as well?”



“No, I just want you to answer the question, truthfully.” Drunk or not, there was no world in which Vivian was going to let this heathen push her around. He was the one with his hand out. She would make sure he knew that.



“Yeah, I’d say so.”



“See that wasn’t so hard was it?” Vivian said, moving on. “Now if you don’t mind could you tell me a little about yourself Mr. Blake? Where you’re from, work history, marital status – if any – whatever you feel comfortable telling me.”



Blake gave another amused chuckle. “Not much to tell. Typical poverty upbringing across the bay from a place you wouldn’t even know. When I was of age I joined the military, did my contract years, got out and now enjoy civilian life where I take work whenever I can…or can't. I’ve never been married and have no kids.”



“Current employment?”



“Currently, none.”



“Current family situation?



“Just a sister.”



“Was that the woman I saw you with the other day?”



Blake’s eyes grew puzzled, “The other day?”



“Yes, last week-end during service – the pretty brunette you came in with?”



Blakes face scrutinized the table-top while his mouth curled into a frown. “I don’t remember anything that happened here last weekend.” he said; more as a question than a statement.



He wasn’t feigning ignorance either, that was for sure. Had he really been *that* drunk?



Vivian marveled at how an event between two people could be recollected in such vastly different ways. She would never forget what happened last Sunday for quite some time. While for Blake, on the other hand, it was nothing more than a drunken haze.



“You know what, it’s not that important,” Vivian said, shaking her head. “Do you and your sister live together?”



“We share an apartment downtown. Best we can do while money is low.”



“Is she employed?”



“She waitresses. Also, downtown.”



“Would you be opposed to helping the church out with community service for a couple of hours, say every other week?”. And there it was. The question that repelled almost fifty percent of their would-be attendee’s. Effort. Most people wanted to use as little of it as possible.



“Ah for fucks sake.” Blake grunted.



“God helps those who help themselves Mr. Blake,” Vivian said, plainly “And also those who help others when they can.”



Blakes chest heaved with an internal struggle before he breathed out a heavy sigh and said. “Sure, fine.”



“What about attending Sunday service, at least three times per month?”



“Sure,” he replied through gritted teeth.

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Duet Night Abyss, One Step from Eden, and Rune Factory 4. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

33F Hi, this will be my last post here for a while, as I want to take a breather here for a while and a break. However, I'm looking for unwell depressed introverted alternative friends that love Nintendo games and completing Fall Guys events. 

Yeah, before messaging me you should listen to Sleep Token Emergence and Caramel right now as those are my favorite songs. Location can be worldwide or U.S. like me. 

Well, I thought for my last post here on this subreddit for a while before I'd take a break from posting, that I never went through the things of why I'm looking to chat with people online only and that I've the same hobbies as me. 

Yeah, speaking of my music style, do I dye my hair and do I stick with the same color of hair dye?

My hair is dyed dark red at the roots and my ends dark brown. Yeah, I've been dying my hair this hair color for this whole year of 2025, as dark reds and browns are what is in my style of what I want to dye my hair color right now.

Yeah, this month though I decided to dye my hair dark maroon black and dark brown on my ends, obviously I'm HATING this color combo, because you can barely see the dark maroon color and the color is fading not in a pretty shade as I would've wanted.

Yeah, in January 2026 I'm going to find a red velvet hair dye and go back to my usual dark brown hair dye that I use for my ends.

Am I doing anything for the New Year? 

No, maybe just ordering Chinese food or just getting me McDonald's and maybe buying a new Final Fantasy game, I've been missing playing Final Fantasy Zodiac Age and the game is lost, have been looking for the game for a while and I can't find the Final Fantasy game.

Well I'm not going to do anything but sit on my bed like a couch, try to complete the winter event on Fall Guys and maybe do a fast food order on McDonald's 🤣

What is your favorite Chinese take out?

What's your favorite and least favorite mobile order? Last thing you might ask is why won't you see anyone in person that you text on Reddit/Discord? Weird?

Not weird, I'm too broke being on SSI and the rules that I live in my state. I've to be responsible to pay for the plane ticket as I'm not allowed for others to pay for my plane ticket without getting my SSI in jeopardy and I could have my SSI check revoked.

The only thing I've money for every single month is paying my host home half of rent until I get my own government funding apartment that I've already applied for/got approved (just on a waiting list.) bills, whatever food stamps doesn't cover, band merchandise and video games 🤣

Yeah, I even have 1 online friend that I've been with for years and even told me that the reason why they never saw me for those 5 years is the lack of funds there isn't enough left over each month for a plane ticket.

Well, I'm not going to unfriend my online friend because of financial issues.

Yeah, I've been removed from online friendship status because I'm too broke and I didn't want any changes with me being too broke.

Yeah, sorry but I'm not going to throw away an online friendship that I've been with for years because my friend told me that they still can't afford a plane ticket. 

Why would I throw an online friendship away that we've been online friends for years, because my online friend still cannot afford a plane ticket? 

Yeah, I can say that I've been dumped as online friendships because I'm too broke and the shock factor that SSI at least in my state will not let others pay for my plane ticket without harming my only source of income.

However, let's end this on a positive note. If you don't know how to start your chat requests because you're too shy then maybe you can tell me your favorite pizza topping and least favorite pizza topping? 

Yeah, you can also tell me your favorite sandwich topping and least favorite pizza toppings? Yeah, you can even let me know your favorite 🎄 or New Year's dish and even your favorite seasonal dish.

How do you enjoy your coffee? Favorite type of pasta dish, favorite energy drink and snacks when video gaming?

Yeah, for me I normally get Mcdonald's iced French vanilla coffee or caramel iced coffee twice a week. Starbucks I'd sometimes only buy something from Starbucks every week and a half or two because it's pricey because I love to have the iced teas and a nice VERY sweet frappe with one of their sandwiches. 

Coffee at the house?

No, not often unless instant and I will be brewing a nice caffeine or caffeine tea every single day.

If that doesn't work you can let me know what games you're looking forward to next year in 2026 and what game you're currently playing right now.

Just let me know your favorite hobbies, interests and you can even give me a mini-bio packed of what you're into right now and you don't have to worry about being basic. Yeah, as long as you don't say hi/hello then you're fine. 

Yeah, let's just text about life, your hobbies, interests, I want to know what makes you happy and just as much as I'm happy when you tickle my Vessel brain. Yeah, I'm looking forward to messaging you and if you're in your 20s, that's fine. ",1,1766883676.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,4,1.0,False
1pxdvjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSpreadContent/comments/1pxdvjl/customizable_mobile_food_trailer_musthaves/,"Customizable Mobile Food Trailer Must-Haves: Storage, Power, and Safety","If you're diving into the world of mobile food service, building your dream setup starts with understanding the essentials. A well-outfitted mobile food trailer isn't just about flashy designs or trendy menus—it's about functionality, efficiency, and safety. To truly thrive on the road, every inch of your trailer must be thoughtfully designed with a few must-haves in mind: smart storage, reliable power, and foolproof safety.

**1. Smart Storage Solutions**  
In a compact mobile food environment, storage can make or break your workflow. That’s why maximizing vertical and horizontal space is crucial. Shelving units, under-counter cabinets, and magnetic storage for utensils help reduce clutter. Stainless steel work tables with integrated shelves offer both prep space and convenient access to ingredients or tools. Plus, dry and cold storage compartments should be clearly separated to comply with health regulations and maintain food quality. Think of your trailer as a tiny house—everything needs a place, and every place needs a purpose.

**2. Reliable Power Supply**  
From refrigerators to fryers and lighting to POS systems, your trailer's operations hinge on a consistent power source. Investing in a well-organized electrical system, including backup power options like generators or battery packs, keeps everything running smoothly even during unexpected outages. If you're using multiple appliances at once, ensure your power system can handle the load to avoid mid-service breakdowns. Also, consider energy-efficient appliances to reduce strain on your setup while lowering operational costs.

**3. Top-Notch Safety Features**  
Safety is non-negotiable when working in a fast-paced, high-heat environment. Fire suppression systems, proper ventilation hoods, non-slip flooring, and clearly marked emergency exits are vital components. Easily accessible fire extinguishers and first-aid kits should be within reach at all times. Also, proper lighting not only enhances visibility for cooking but ensures customers and staff stay safe during night operations.

At the heart of every successful operation is a well-equipped **customizable mobile food trailer**. When you build with intention—focusing on efficient storage, dependable power, and essential safety—you create a space that not only meets regulations but also supports your creativity and passion. Whether you're crafting street tacos or artisan coffee, the right trailer setup makes the entire experience more enjoyable and sustainable.

So take the time to design it right the first time—your future self (and your hungry customers) will thank you.",1,1766883668.0,TheSpreadContent,0,1.0,False

1pxduji,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1pxduji/paris_trip_report_december/,Paris Trip Report (December),"First, thank you to everyone who posts here and helps make travel a little easier.

We recently stayed in Paris for a week. We’re two adults and were there just before Christmas, leaving on the 21st. We stayed just north of the Marais. It was a whirlwind of a trip and an easy 9/10. Honestly, it might be hard to go back anytime soon because the bar is very high.

**Food**  
**Early June** – Fantastic. An Icelandic team was cooking when we visited.  
**Clamato** – Great seafood. Average service. Terrible pacing (everything arrived at once).  
**Orson** – Amazing food. Terrible pacing (way too slow).  
**Dalmata** – Meh. Better pizza elsewhere.  
**Dumbo** – Nuggets, cheeseburgers, fries. Lovely. Perfectly smashed burgers.  
**Ladurée** – Had to go for the macarons.  
**Bistro des Tournelles** – Perfect. Get the mushrooms and the fries.  
**Rori Rori** – Great vibe, fantastic pizza, lovely drinks.  
**Rojo** – Dark, moody, fun place for an evening out. Great bar staff.

**Bakeries**  
**Alexine** – Great pastries.  
**Croûton** – Solid choice for pastries and sandwiches.  
**Mamiche** – Awesome pastries and sandwiches. Good early for the best selection.  
**Cédric Grolet Café** – The hazelnut pizza cookie is so good.  
**Tout Autour du Pain** – Lovely “local spot” vibe.

**Coffee**  
**Motors Coffe**e – Great beans, rough service.  
**The Stray Bean** – Perfect stop before Versailles.  
**Tanat** – Great beans, lovely service.  
**Telescope** – Lovely service and great Aeropress technique.  
**KB Coffee** – Perfect place to sit outside, sip good coffee, and people-watch.  
**Dreamin’ Man** – Lovely local spot with a great team serving pour-overs.  
**Café Nuances** – Great beans, but the space was a bit intense; I couldn’t have stayed more than five minutes without a headache.

**Wine Bar**  
**Monsieur Henri** – We ended a few nights here. At first, we were concerned by the lack of patrons, but as natural wine lovers, this quickly became a highlight. The owner introduced guests to each other, and we met some amazing people who invited us to their own establishments or out to dinner. It felt almost movie-like in how warm and welcoming everyone was.

**Museums**  
**Musée d’Orsay** – My favourite of the trip.  
**Louvre** – Just wow. Hard to describe.  
**Musée National Picasso-Paris** – Loved the current exhibition.  
**Musée de la Libération de Paris** – A must if you’re into WWII.  
**Château de Versailles** – So glad we went. What a place.

**Markets**  
**Tuileries Garden Christmas Market** – Great for sipping hot wine and wandering for 30–60 minutes.  
**Notre-Dame Christmas Market** – Just outside ND; the raclette baguette was one of the best bites of the trip. I could’ve eaten three.  
**Eiffel Tower Christmas Market** – Just avoid.

We walked roughly 20–25 km per day and took the metro when needed. While busy, the metro served us well. Foot and bike traffic reminded me of Copenhagen — scooters and bikes zip in and out quickly, which can feel overwhelming if you’re not watching both directions.

The people we met were amazing. We never experienced the “rude” vibe that people sometimes talk about. The sights were everything and more, though the Eiffel Tower and Champs-Élysées were the low point simply due to the crowds. Being constantly bumped into can be unnerving.

I didn’t try to make a “perfect ADHD planner” because I don’t think that exists. ADHD is too personal. I just tried to make something that feels gentler on messy, low-energy days, instead of demanding or guilt-inducing.  
That’s why it includes things like **mood-based pages**, **reset / ADHD rescue pages**, **prefilled example pages**, a **dopamine menu**, gentle quotes, small challenges, and even a little illustrated index so you don’t get lost.

I’m sharing this mostly because finishing it felt like a win. My sleep schedule can finally recover.

If you try it, I’d genuinely love your feedback. I’m still learning, and I want to keep making this as ADHD-friendly as possible.

1pxdt77,https://www.reddit.com/r/ranvooofficial/comments/1pxdt77/brushing_teeth_before_bed_a_gentle_massage_for/,Brushing Teeth Before Bed: A Gentle Massage for Your Teeth and a Release from Fatigue,"After a long day of rushing around, we remember to take a warm bath for our bodies and play soothing music for our minds, yet we often overlook that the ""little friends"" in our mouths also need a gentle ""relaxation ritual."" Many people regard brushing teeth at night as a mandatory health task, forgetting that it is essentially a healing moment for ourselves—taking a few minutes to give our teeth a deep massage, relieving the day's fatigue through gentle cleaning, and allowing both body and mind to fall asleep peacefully with a fresh feeling.

You may not realize it, but just like our shoulders, necks, waists, and backs, our teeth are silently ""carrying a heavy load"" during the day. The repeated effort of chewing three meals a day, and the residue from snacks, coffee, and strong tea, keep our teeth and gums in a constant state of ""tension."" The food debris hidden between the teeth and in the gum grooves is like dust on our shoulders—it not only breeds bacteria but also leaves an subtle sense of ""discomfort"" in the mouth, a fatigue so faint that it's easily overlooked. Brushing teeth at night is precisely the key to ""unburdening"" the teeth: when the toothbrush glides gently over the tooth surfaces, removing every trace of residue with foam, it's like a masseuse easing the soreness in our shoulders and neck, soothing the teeth from their tense state.

This sense of relaxation from the ""tooth massage"" also spreads throughout the body through the senses. Imagine: after a day's work, you stand under warm lighting, squeeze out toothpaste with a faint pleasant fragrance, and let the toothbrush move slowly in your mouth—gliding over the smooth surfaces of your front teeth, reaching the hard-to-clean crevices of your back teeth, and brushing gently along the gum line. The coolness of the toothpaste dispels the stuffiness in your mouth, and the slight vibration of the toothbrush carries a comforting power. At this moment, you don't have to think about work trivialities or worry about life's troubles; you just need to focus on this simple act of cleaning. This focus itself is a form of ""mindful relaxation,"" allowing tense nerves to calm down gradually and letting the day's fatigue be washed away along with the foam.

More importantly, this ""relaxation ritual"" prepared for the teeth also clears the way for sleep. If you don't brush your teeth before bed, the residue in your mouth will breed bacteria, which not only causes morning bad breath but also leaves the mouth in an invisible state of ""discomfort"" at night. This subtle discomfort quietly affects sleep quality, making it difficult to enter deep sleep. In contrast, a mouth that has been gently cleaned and massaged will have a fresh texture and a faint fragrance, making swallowing feel effortless. When the mouth is comfortable, the relaxation of the body and mind becomes more complete—falling asleep becomes easier, and sleep quality improves subtly. This is the ""hidden benefit"" that brushing teeth at night brings to the body.

Some people say, ""If I don't eat at night, I don't need to brush my teeth."" This is actually a misunderstanding of ""relaxing for oneself."" Even without eating, the plaque and oral secretions accumulated during the day still leave the teeth in a ""burdened"" state—just as we need to stretch and relax at night even if we haven't done heavy work. Others replace brushing teeth with chewing gum or mouthwash, forgetting that they cannot replace the ""massage feeling"" of a toothbrush. Chewing gum can only clean the surface simply, and mouthwash can only bring temporary coolness. Only the physical friction of a toothbrush can truly provide deep relief to the teeth and gums—a sense of relaxation that no other method can match.

To maximize the ""relaxation effect"" of brushing teeth at night, the key lies in ""slowness"" and ""gentleness."" There's no need to pursue ""the harder you brush, the cleaner it gets""; instead, brush as gently as you would for a massage. Choose a soft-bristled toothbrush, pair it with mild fluoride toothpaste, and use the ""Bass method""—hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the tooth surface, and slowly clean every surface of each tooth for 2-3 minutes. After brushing, use dental floss to gently clean between the teeth, like the finishing touch of a ""deep SPA"" for your teeth. If possible, rinse your mouth with warm water to make the soothing feeling in your mouth last longer. Remember, these few minutes are entirely yours—no need to rush, just enjoy this cleaning ritual made for yourself.

In the end, brushing teeth at night is never a ""task"" but an expression of self-love. It's not about pleasing anyone or simply preventing illness; it's about giving your tired self a little comfort with a gentle tooth massage at the end of the day. When you turn brushing teeth from something ""you have to do"" into something ""you want to do,"" from a ""health obligation"" into a ""relaxation ritual,"" you'll find that these short few minutes can heal both body and mind. Tonight, slow down, give your teeth a sincere massage, and bid farewell to the tired day in freshness and relaxation.",1,1766883492.0,ranvooofficial,0,1.0,False

1pxdr5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pxdr5d/disappearances_in_a_strange_town_short_story/,Disappearances in a strange town - [Short story],"PART ONE.

Out of all the places I've went to over the years, this has to be one of the strangest. It always feels like the people here always know something you don't, even if the knowledge is foolish. Most of them are old tales of ghosts that spread from a child's bedroom at a sleepover and were eventually told by grandparents beside a campfire.

Like the story of Jacob Miller who was ten years old in 1996 who was woken up late at night by the sound of rustling outside, he thought it was a raccoon or possum so he went to check his window and all he saw was a ""messy looking face"", before he could even react it was gone. 

Or the story of Heather Morgan who was thirteen in 1994 who went camping with her family in the local Falls Forest, her older sister who was sixteen, was acting odd all day, apparently she'd stare aimlessly into the distance like she saw something nobody else could. The next day when morning came, her sister was nowhere to be found, but her coat and shoes were left in her tent. even after the police searched and searched for her, they found nothing.

So many stories surrounding this town, most of them made up ghost stories. Some I believe to be connected to disappearances that have occurred within the last 11 years. Fiction and reality is a strange blur in this town, but not for me.

I'm a detective, been one for what feels like most of my life, the year is 1999 and the streetlights outside my motel room are dim, much like the people in this town. Minds full of dreams of ghouls and spirits wandering the world, meanwhile my mind is full of the faces found on missing person posters.

Speaking of dreams, it's getting late and I've got an early day tomorrow.

PART TWO.

It's currently December, snow hasn't fallen yet. I see Christmas decorations in the windows of family homes and local stores. This town is old and claustrophobicly small, it feels like everyone knows everyone here. It's early morning, I leave my cramped motel room and lock the door behind me as I walk towards my old 1993 chevrolet caprice that's been worn down over the years, much like myself.

As I begin to unlock my car a man on the second floor of the motel waves to me as if he knows me. I'd say he was in his fortys, a couple years older than myself. 

""mornin friend"" 
He said with a carefree tone as he yelled down at me, he had the look of a man who's only ever known the good in others.

""mornin'."" 
I say with no enthusiasm for this to become a conversation 

""You best be careful on the roads, startin' to get icy now"" 
He said with a laugh before he continued,
""Meant to be snowing by the end of the week"" 

""Thanks for tellin' me."" 
I said with a wave as I got into my car, shutting the door and lighting up a cigarette before starting the engine.

The drive into town took no more than twenty minutes, the motel sat near the edge of town, with the forest that surrounded the town all around it. Driving on winding roads surrounded by looming trees. No wonder it's so easy for people to disappear here, or to be taken without a trace. Everyone here seems to think the disappearances are paranormal, some think it's long dead friends calling to the living, some think it's an evil spirit tempting people away and back into nature.

I think neither, I think it's some godforsaken lunatic who's been killing people. I know no bodies have been found, nor a trace of them. But I feel it, I know it. Even when for lack of a better word, they've fallen off the face of the earth. 

I'm going to talk to a man today, he's the grandad of a boy that went missing eight months ago I don't know the details yet but I will soon.

I park outside the mans house, I toss my cigarette before walking up the steps to the front door and ring the bell, a short elderly man opens it. He looks like the stereotypical grandpa. in his seventies I'd say.

""Thanks for meeting me so early Mr Greyshore""
I said to the man as I shook his hand

""Ah don't thank me, better early than late.""
He said as we sat down at the livingroom table

I took a breath ""could you describe to me what happened? On the nineteenth of April?""

Mr Greyshore looked down slightly before looking back at me, he inhaled deeply before replying 

""Of course, it was a normal day. Until it happened. My grandson was staying here for the night while his father was busy with work. Young Hunter was playing on his games in the evening, I don't understand all that stuff"" he said with a small chuckle

""I had a dog you see, Benny was his name. I could swear Hunter loved that dog even more than myself. All at a sudden I heard Hunter screaming that the dogs gone, I said he must be hiding but thats when I heard him barking from outside. I thought I was hearing things for a second, because the last time I saw Benny he was upstairs. He couldn't of gotten outside without me or Hunter seeing him""
Mr Greyshore placed his palm on his forehead as he sighed, with a deep look of regret on his face, as if every tragedy was upon his shoulders, weighing him down.

""Mr Greyshore, what happened next?"" 
I said in a low gentle tone

""Yes, sorry"" he cleared his through before continuing 

""Hunter ran down the stairs, asked me if I heard Benny too, I said yes of course and told him to wait inside while I go fetch him. He wanted to come with me course, but I made sure he stayed inside and waited. So I locked the backdoor behind me as I stepped outside, before going out into the woods""

Mr Greyshore glanced to the window, it looked like he saw something for a split second, before he turned back to me and continued talking

""It was dark, darkest I've ever seen it. I yelled Benny's name over and over. He didn't come, I looked all over for him, tried to keep going but the darkness just kept growing, and Benny wasn't barking. So I went home, thought maybe he'd find his way back, I wasn't too worried, strong old dog. Besides, not been a bear nor stag in those woods for decades, so I didn't need to worry about him getting attacked by something""

Poor man, he was trying so hard to avoid speaking of the conclusion to that day. I could see it in his eyes so clearly, but I sadly couldn't allow that.

""What happened when you came home Mr Greyshore?"" 

took a deep breath, before speaking ""when I came back, I saw-""
He stuttered, his voice was shaky as he continued ""the backdoor, it was wide open. I ran inside as fast as I could, shouted for Hunter, I looked everywhere in my house and-"" 
Mr Greyshore was barely holding himself together at this point, yet even so. He continued on ""he was gone, just like all the others. No trace or anything! Just fuckin' gone!"" He was starting to shout, as tears formed in his eyes.

""It's not your fault, Mr Greyshore. Nothing that's happened here, is your fault.""
I was never good at comforting the grieving, but I had to try.

I stood up from the chair, I began to walk to the frontdoor as I turned to the man and said ""if there's anything you need, or anything else that comes to light, please call me.""

I opened the front door before Mr Greyshore spoke again ""there was something"" he said without facing me ""it was left beside the backdoor about a week before Hunter went missing, a sculpture. I didn't know what it was. I just thought it was Hunter trying to be funny, maybe he saw something online. That's what I thought at the time at least.""

""Could you describe it?"" 
I asked quizzically 

""It was twigs, few of them all tied together with some kinda twine to form a pyramid. In the middle of it, there was a small piece of antler dangling from the tip of the pyramid""

""And what did you do with it?""

Mr Greyshore looked up at me, his face pale ""I destroyed it. Anytime I'd look at it, I'd get this feeling, this dark sense emanating from it, like it was something dangerous and connected to something much darker than even that forest at night."" 

""Take care of yourself, Mr Greyshore. Thank you for all of this, you've been a big help"" 

As I turned to go out the door, he spoke again. ""Don't go out into the woods at night.""

As I lit another cigarette, I thought to myself. Poor Mr Greyshore, he'd rather believe in supernatural lunacy and have an ounce of hope, than face the tragic reality, his grandson was kidnapped and was most likely dead. I don't know why children are being taken.

But I know this: there is nothing supernatural in this town.

PART THREE

This town, it's miles away from any city. It's an old rural town, a small one. Got a church, school and everything else you'd expect, from what I can tell It's the kind of place people go to raise a family, the kind of place I would've liked to raise my own family, I see parents and their kids following them down the street, only thing that's followed me in my life is tragedy. 

Every case in recent years it seems as if the local police in this town do the bare minimum, it's almost as if they expect that the kids will never be found. They do searches all over town, even in the woods and find nothing, they check cctv that only ever records grainy imaged of the streets at night, they talk to the grieving parents who know nothing but the fact that they want their child home and safe. It feels like the local police have become desensitised to it all, beaten down year by year, cold case by cold case until they've lost all hope of finding them.

It's like they think these kids have just ceased to exist.

I drive down the road, to the house of a girl who went missing around a month ago. There's two kids bikes leant against the front of the house next to the front door, one of which will most likely never be ridden again. You'd never expect such a horror had ever occurred at their house, a normal house with a normal family, undeservingly stricken with the most horrific of tragedies. I'm welcomed in by the mother of the two children, she looked dishevelled to say the least, yet still had the strength to keep himself together.

""Thanks for comin' detective"" 

""No, thank you for agreeing to this, Mrs Nichols""
I say as she leads me into the living room, she motions towards the arm chair across from the couch. She sat on the couch which had a small coffee table infront of it.

""I'm sorry my husband isn't here, he's out working. I've just started clearin' out the attic with my boy for the first time in years. Even if it's just trying to keep myself busy.""
Mrs Nichols said with a forced, shortlived laugh

""Don't worry about it. I know this is tough subject, but could you tell me everything you remember leading up to your daughter's disappearance?. On the seventh of November""

Mrs Nichols sat on the couch silently for a moment, composing herself before answering

""Yes. Yes, of course""

""Normal day, normal everythin' I guess until the end of it. The kids wanted to do an 'all nighter' as they called it, they'd been beggin' us for weeks about it, watch a film downstairs, eat popcorn and tell scary stories. Me and my husband finally decided to let them. We shouldn't of let them now that I look back on it.""
Mrs Nichols took a shaky breath, before continuing 

""She wouldn't of ran away, I'm tellin' you she wouldn't. Even if we left the doors unlocked, she wouldn't of been able to reach the door handles.""
Mrs Nichols began to cry, before inhaling deeply and continuing 

""My boy told me what he saw that night, haunts us all, probably will haunt us till we die. He told us he went to the bathroom, then when he went back into the livingroom, it was complete silence except for the static on the TV. He told me he thought she was playing hide and seek at first, then he realized the backdoor was wide open. I remember his scream, screamed for us saying she was taken by a monster. My husband ran outside while I called the police. Nobody found a damn trace of her, nothin!.""
Mrs Nichols fell silent, as tears began to fall down her face

""I'm sorry. If it's any consolation to you, I know what you're going through""

""You have a child?""
She asked in a somber tone

""Used to, yes""

""I'm so sorry""
She said softly

""Don't be, not your fault nor mine. Just some idiot who decided to drive home drunk out of his mind. I was at work when it happened, My wife was driving our son home from preschool one moment, then the next moment they were..""
I paused, before clearing my throat and continuing 

""Sorry, got off topic for a moment there. Anyway, is there anything else you know? Anything you've seen?"" 

""No, nothin'""

""Mom!!"" 
A voice shouted from upstairs, Mrs Nichols son Jamie

""Yes honey?!""
Mrs Nichols shouted back 

""What's this?
Jamie yelled before he started to come down the stairs 

""What's what?""
Mrs Nichols asked 

""This weird stick thing?"" 
Jamie said as he entered the living room, holding exactly what Mr Greyshore said he found before his grandson disappeared. It was just like he described, sticks in the shape of a pyramid, held together by twine. The same twine that connected to a piece of antler that was hanging from the top of the pyramid.

I was speechless, completely and utterly speechless. I was trying to come up with something to say before Mrs Nichols spoke 

""Maybe it's the old owners and we only just found it?"" Mrs Nichols said with a tinge of concern in her voice as Jamie put the stick pyramid down on the coffee table before running up the stairs again

""Something just like that found in someone else's home too, the home of a man who's grandson went missing eight months ago"" I paused for a moment ""don't touch it, I'll have someone come by and take it into evidence""

Mrs Nichols looked confused for a second before her eyes widened, realising what this meant. 

Someone is putting these in people's homes, most likely the person responsible for all the disappearances in the town. But how? They'd have to break in then get all the way up into the attic, it made no sense. Why'd they go through all the effort just for that?.

I still don't know why yet, but I know for certain now that there has to be someone doing all of this. I'm going to catch them, so that no other children are ripped away from their families.

FINAL PART.

I've been investigating for months now and I've made almost no progress. Nothing about this case makes any sense, honestly I'm starting to feel like maybe there's something wrong with me. Sometimes when I'm alone, in my motel room or driving my car, I feel like I'm not truly alone, like someone is watching me.
I'm having odd nightmares too. 
I see a door in a dark empty almost liminal room. I know this place, it's my old home from when my wife was alive.
One second the door is closed and in the next, it's wide open as darkness seeps in, it consumes me before trees and branches come into view through the shadows. 

Sometimes I wish I could be like the people here, if I was than maybe I could chalk it up to the universe giving me some kind of sign. But I can't do that, I wish I could dream of a fantastical reason for all the horrors in my life, but then I'd become lost in them. Drifting from one delusion to another in an infinite loop.

My boss called me, he's getting agitated by the lack of progress I've made in this case. He told me he's going to pull me off the case and put someone else onto if I don't find something quick. As if they'll find anything I haven't already found. Not even search dogs can get a trace of them. No footprints, no dna no nothing. It's like these kids have just been wiped from existence. 

It was around 1AM, it was starting to snow outside and I was smoking a cigarette as a read through police reports from old disappearances in the area, trying to connect them to the newer ones as I heard something at the door. Scratching like an animal trying to get in, maybe a raccoon or something. I got up as I put the cigarette into the ashtray before opening the door. It was a small brown dog, before I could check it's collar for a name tag or even get a decent look at the dog, it ran off around the back of the motel, before stopping to look back at me periodically, as if it wanted me to follow it. So I did, hoping I could get him inside incase it was someone's lost dog, hoping I could bring it home to its family, not disimilar to what I yearned to do for the families that live in this town, even though I knew it was impossible.

I walked towards to the dog, before it ran towards the forest. So I ran after it, I knew it was a mistake to go into that forest at night, yet I did it anyway. I chased it, deeper and deeper into the forest. Then I lost sight of it before it started to bark, over and over again it barked as I tried to find it, I followed the noise deeper into the forest, after a while I realized I had lost track of where I was, I could barely see anything. The snow was falling faster. 

Then I noticed something else, the barking sounded wrong somehow. One bark, a pause then two quick barks before repeating itself. Over and over again in that exact order, like it was a recording of a dog barking and it was set on loop. Something was terribly wrong here.

I turned around to run but then I saw a tree larger than any other that sat in the middle of a small clearing. It towered over the surrounding trees and its leafless branches gave it an almost skeletal appearance. The peak of the trunk split into two large branches that reached out to each side, while many smaller branches sprouted from atop them.

Then the barking stopped instantly, as if someone was flicking a switch. I walked towards the large tree, closer and closer as the snow started to swallow up the grass. As I got closer, I saw the dog curled up at the foot of the tree. It was dead and deep into decomposition. I could see part of its skull through its matted furr, I knelt down to check for a name tag, it had one.
The dogs name was Benny, it was Mr Greyshores dog.

I reach for my phone before I heard the crunch of snow being stepped on behind me. I quickly turn around and all I could see in the darkness was what looked to be a girl with long unkempt hair that went down past her waist, she started to move towards me but it was wrong, she was getting closer to me but she wasn't taking any steps, like a statue being pushed forward.

I ran as fast as I could, all I knew in that moment was that I had to get out of there, I knew there was nothing but the unexplainable in those woods. It took a while but I made myself back to the motel and got on the phone to the local police, I told them that there's a young girl in the forest that needs help, I also told them about the dog. They told me that they'd look into it and send people out there to look.

Then I called my boss, I tried explaining everything to him but he wouldn't listen to a word except for the part where I ran away from a supposed missing girl who was lost in a forest.
He told me I'm going to assist the local police in their search before I'm suspended for gross dereliction of duty.

We searched all over town and all around the forest for over a week straight. I even searched where I believed the large tree to be, I looked all over that area yet the tree, the dog and the girl were gone. Like every other search for a missing person, we found absolutely nothing.

I was fired after a weeks long suspension, I desperately tried explaining to my boss and anyone that would listen for even a minute that something wasn't right in that forest, I suppose they just assumed I had gone mad and brushed me off as deluded, so I was fired. My investigation meant nothing in the end.

That town, it's not normal. It's not right, it's not just disappearances it's something else, something I could never hope to explain or rationalise.

All I know is that you should never go into that forest. Not because you'll be kidnapped or murdered by some degenerate lunatic, but because there is something much worse in those woods. Like all the cases surrounding that place, it is something that will never be solved.",2,1766883333.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

\*\*This is written on a burner acc but PM if you have any questions

Before you read my application I think it's important to include some details. One of which is that my dream school (you'll see later in the post) had no acceptances from my school in more than half a decade lol... I come from a relatively under resourced but well-off region in Canada as well. Usually 1-2 people out of 150+ graduates go to an Ivy/T10 university.

I began my college journey back in 9th grade when I saw college admissions influencers on social media who were anxiety-baiting me. College applications were genuinely all I could think about sometimes. I would spend hours camped out in coffee shops writing my university essays too. Now seeing where I am at, it's insane to remember how I used to doomscroll this subreddit. Don't compare me to yourself or others because my context is different from yours. Hope you enjoy and this is somewhat helpful.

**Letters of Recommendation**

LOR #1: AP Human Geo Teacher (12/10) - I have known this teacher for 10+ years since she is one of my friend's moms. She taught me for 2 years of highschool and is the sponsor teacher of a club I run. I know she wrote me a strong letter and heard snippets from her.

LOR #2: Social Studies Teacher (12/10) - This LOR was well written and my teacher was also very articulate too. He told me he wrote phrases such as ""\_\_\_\_ is the most capable student I have met in over a decade of teaching""

Optional LOR #3: While this was only submitted to Stanford, I used a LOR written by a professor there. While I don't know the contents of the letter, I know it was very likely related to the paper I wrote as well. It really helped with my narrative and his support was highly beneficial too.

**Interviews**

Stanford: I thought the interview went horrible -- I was asked questions that I had not prepared for eg. which month did you win this award? It was not the traditional questions I was used to leading me to believe that I screwed it all up. What's more was that I arrived late because of tech issues. I profusely apologized but I truly believed I was doomed. I cried to my mom about it as well.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: I thought my personal statement was strong. I had always been a relatively decent writer and able to convey my thoughts. Personally, I think part of the reason I got in was because I had a through narrative — through my personal statement, ecs, and awards in general with relation to my intended major. (I did also have a essay counselor too).

Common App Supplementals: I thought I did quite well on the supplementals, I strangely had a lot of fun writing them as well when I wasn't busy and burnt out. Personally I thought my application had a very obvious theme and highlighted my strengths well and my supplementals were just an addition to it.

UK Personal Statement: I wrote these very quickly partially due to how the nature of the essays are meant to me (UK unis want very literal and explicit essays) so it was quickly done. They weren't bad per se but they weren't phenomenal in my opinion.

**Decisions:**

*Pending Decisions:*

*Canada:*

* McGill University
* University of Toronto

*UK:*

* London School of Economics
* University of Edinburgh
* UCL (withdrawn since I didn't want to take their entrance exam...)

*US:*

* >!Stanford (REA)!<

**COMITTED:** >!**STANFORD!!🌲❤️**!<

**Additional Information:**

I had done an InitialView interview because I'm international to prove my English fluency (despite speaking at a native level lol). I don't know if it had much impact but I sent it to almost all the universities I was applying to as well.

Feel free to ask me any questions. I'm going to continue to update this post with my decisions as they roll in. I'd love to hear any of your predictions as well. Good luck to everyone else who is in the application process.

**Advice:**

* I think for me the most important part was being myself and showing my narrative. If my extra-curriculars were not explicitly related to my major/theme I would write about them in my supplementals for example. I think this was important because everything was intentional.
* In addition, make sure to read the page every university has about what they look for in a student. I learned about how Stanford searches for intellectual vitatlity and it made a huge difference in my application.
* When writing your supplementals, don't be a bot. I remember writing about Buzzfeed quizzes, going on dates with my friends, capsizing while kayaking, etc. I was very personal and showed that side of me too.
* Nothing is ever that deep as well. I thought I was screwed applying to such important universities with two 4s and some grades in the low 90s. It wasn't that important in the end and worth stressing about.

I feel resentful because I am always the sole initiator of dates, and he has postponed a simple 2-hour date request for over 3 months. He says that because we see each other at home all day, he doesn't feel the need to go out and feels pressured when I ask. How do we find a balance so I have the quality time I need with him and he gets his alone time?

Me (33F) and my boyfriend (36M) have been together for five years and living together for the last two. 
During the relationship we always spent most of our time together staying at home, doing parallel play which we both like and sometimes playing games or watching films. I was always, almost exclusively, the one to suggest any other kind of date, asking him to go grab a coffee/beer or go for a walk or to the cinema. Sometimes we did, but most of the time his reaction would be either to say yes and then postpone/forget it for weeks/months, or to have an argument with me about how he feels pressured. As time went by, I started getting annoyed by this pattern of me being the sole initiator, him never planning anything and getting upset at me for asking for more time together. 

The problem right now is I have started feeling resentment because for the last three months I am waiting for a date he promised me (go to play pool for 1-2 hours, my idea). During these three months I brought it up once every two weeks at first, then I started bringing it up more frequently, I told him this situation made me sad and angry more than once. First few times his response was that I was right and we would do it soon. Then he started acting irritated when I brought it up and asked him again. Then we started having arguments every time and he said he needs his alone time and his space, he doesn't feel the need to go outside for any activities with me since we live together and sees me in the house all day and isn't interested in these activities anyway and then he usually shuts down and doesn't want to talk about it anymore.  

Some relevant info: this is the only thing I have asked him to do together outside the house these last few months. Money is not an issue for this particular date. It is true that he doesn't like going out, doesn't do it alone or with other people instead of me. Both of us are currently unemployed and spend all our time together at home but we are struggling to keep a common sleeping schedule and when he is not asleep he games. 

I guess this is all the relevant information, I can provide more context in the comments for anyone who takes the time to read this as its already long. I apologise for errors, english is not my first language. Obligatory: I really love this man, I have thought about marriage, kids, we both have, I am planning the next years with him. Aside this particular issue that makes me feel unappreciated and disrespected, our relationship is mostly wonderful, without arguments, same worldviews and beliefs, we laugh together and we support each other. I do not want to break up, I want to find a middle ground. ",2,1766882997.0,relationships,6,1.0,False

You start by changing your relationship to it.
Here’s how people learn to love (or at least stop hating) something they once couldn’t stand:
1. Stop telling yourself you hate it
Every time you repeat “I hate this,” your brain tightens.
Try swapping it for: “I don’t enjoy this yet, but it serves me.”
Language changes resistance.
2. Attach it to a bigger why
People don’t love the task—they love what it unlocks.
Ask: What does this allow me to have later?
Freedom, money, confidence, peace, options.
When the why is clear, the hate softens.
3. Make it smaller than your emotions
We hate things that feel overwhelming.
Break it down until it feels almost silly:
5 minutes
one page
one email
one step
Momentum changes mood.
4. Redesign the experience
You’re not hating the task—you’re hating how you do it.
Music on
Timer set
Reward after
Different environment
Same task, different nervous system response.
5. Detach your identity from it
You’re not “bad at it” or “lazy.”
It’s just a skill you haven’t practiced enough yet.
Hate often comes from shame, not the task itself.
6. Do it imperfectly on purpose
Perfection creates resentment.
Give yourself permission to do it badly. Progress beats pressure.
7. Pair it with something you enjoy
Coffee, a podcast, a candle, fresh air.
Your brain starts associating the task with comfort instead of threat.
8. Notice who you become by doing it
Confidence grows from keeping promises to yourself.
You may never love the task—but you’ll love who you are when you do it.
9. Thank yourself after
This sounds small, but it rewires self-trust.
A quiet “I did that even though it was hard” matters.
10. Accept that love sometimes looks like discipline
Not everything you love feels good in the moment.
Sometimes love is showing up anyway—because future you deserves it.",1,1766882994.0,u_TheHabitcatalyst,0,1.0,False

1pxdl0f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxdl0f,How to grind acceptable espresso with Kitchenaid burr grinder KCG8433,"So I’ve been easing into coffee culture for a while and now I’m getting into the espresso world. I have a budget friendly setup with a Breville Bambino and the Kitchenaid burr grinder. I knew it probably wasn’t going to work well making espresso with this grinder but I’ve modified it to get good enough shots with a non pressure basket for now until I get a dedicated espresso grinder. I’m here to show the internet what I did so when someone else goes through this it’s easy for them. I’ll start by saying if you’re  getting into exclusively espresso I wouldn’t buy this grinder and I’m sure everyone here would agree with that. But overall I like this grinder a lot for my filtered coffee. It’s super quiet looks good and does a great job for the price. 


Step 1- Empty your bean hopper scooping the beans that have also already gotten through to the burr chamber. Put the hopper back on and run your machine until you can hear that it’s empty. 

Step 2- Remove the top Burr by lifting the thing metal piece, turning it then lifting up. When you remove this you’ll notice it has an internal adjustment on the side. Move that all the way to 1 which is the finest (You may need to adjust this later depending on your setup). 

Step 3- You’ll then see the bottom burr attached with one nut. It’s a 10mm and it’s reverse threaded so loosen that and be careful there are 2 washers below that but you don’t want to lose. So remove all of that and you’ll be able to slide the bottom burr off. 

Step 4- Below the bottom burr you’ll see a spoked distributor. You’ll just pull up on that and it’ll come right out. This is the piece you will be modifying for a finer grind. 

Step 5- Use some foil tape, regular kitchen foil even a soda can and we’re gonna make a shim (a thin piece to move the bottom burr closer to the top burr) for the top of the distributor. I chose to use foil tape and I only used one piece because it’s relatively thick. I used the bottom burr cutting a circle around that with an Xacto knife. Then cut a square out of the middle to account for the bolt and lock that goes through the distributor. 

Step 6- stick on whatever you’re using as a shim put it all back together and dial in that grind! With my setup it’s a grind setting of 60 time of 16.8 for 18g and it’s working well for now. 

I would say this is temporary until you get a nicer grinder because it doesn’t fix the inconsistency of this conical burr grinder. But overall it makes an acceptable shot and will get you through until you want to upgrade!

I was given 10 days 30mg Elvanse and 10 days 50mg to try. I started with 30mg and felt good, first few days were slightly euphoric and then it settled down and it was fine but towards my 8th day it became what felt like completely ineffective (this also happened to be when I started my period  which was heavier and longer than usual), during this stage I upped my dose to 50mg to try which seemed more effective until my 6th day where I woke up with a vestibular migraine which I’ve never had before - I do usually get normal vision loss migraines just before or during my periods but never anything like this. I had extreme dizziness and vertigo and it took me an entire week to recover in which I didn’t take any meds, I don’t know if this was because of the elvanse or because of my period and the fact I’ve always suffered with low iron (it probably didn’t help that I was trying to limit vitamin C to prevent interactions with elvanse). When I felt better I started on 30mg again and felt good but I’m not sure if it was just because I was starting again but then I had to take a break so I could drink during Christmas Eve - Boxing Day. I’ve restarted on 50mg as I don’t have anymore 30mg and I’m waiting to receive 40mg, today I felt slightly wired but really productive and the crash made me irritable and I threw up. I always get gagging attacks when taking Elvanse for some reason?! My head feels tender and pressurised again and I’m scared I’ll experience a vestibular migraine.

I’m awaiting 40mg to try but I’m scared my menstrual cycle is going to affect the efficiency of trialling these meds again and it’s stressing me out how little time you get for titration! Do the symptoms I’m experiencing suggest that 50mg is too much for me or is it just really bad timing that I’ve tried it, should I continue or drop back down? I’ve see some people split the pill and lower the dose that way which is what I’d have to do whilst waiting for the pharmacy to become active again after Christmas. But the main question is how did you know which dose was too little and which dose was too much?

FYI I’ve never struggled with sleeping on either doses, I take my meds around 10am every day as I find it doesn’t last me until the evening and I need to be most productive after work as a priority! I never drink coffee so don’t have any caffeine withdrawal, I have always struggled with binge eating but Elvanse has stopped it so I don’t really want to try any other medications but if somebody has experienced similar symptoms and tried something which helps better I am open to hearing suggestions. I have started taking vitamin D, iron and magnesium supplements. With only 1 appointment left I want to make sure I request something useful to try and want to make the most of my last titration weeks. Has anybody ever had to pay for a longer titration on the right to choose path and was it worth it? What would people recommend I do going forward?

When I felt better I started on 30mg again and felt good but I’m not sure if it was just because I was starting again but then I had to take a break so I could drink during Christmas Eve - Boxing Day. I’ve restarted on 50mg as I don’t have anymore 30mg and I’m waiting to receive 40mg, today I felt slightly wired but really productive and the crash made me irritable and I threw up. I always get gagging attacks when taking Elvanse for some reason?! My head feels tender and pressurised again and I’m scared I’ll experience a vestibular migraine. 

I’m awaiting 40mg to try but I’m scared my menstrual cycle is going to affect the efficiency of trialling these meds again and it’s stressing me out how little time you get for titration! Do the symptoms I’m experiencing suggest that 50mg is too much for me or is it just really bad timing that I’ve tried it, should I continue or drop back down? I’ve see some people split the pill and lower the dose that way which is what I’d have to do whilst waiting for the pharmacy to become active again after Christmas. But the main question is how did you know which dose was too little and which dose was too much? 

FYI I’ve never struggled with sleeping on either doses, I take my meds around 10am every day as I find it doesn’t last me until the evening and I need to be most productive after work as a priority! I never drink coffee so don’t have any caffeine withdrawal, I have always struggled with binge eating but Elvanse has stopped it so I don’t really want to try any other medications but if somebody has experienced similar symptoms and tried something which helps better I am open to hearing suggestions. I have started taking vitamin D, iron and magnesium supplements. With only 1 appointment left I want to make sure I request something useful to try and want to make the most of my last titration weeks. Has anybody ever had to pay for a longer titration on the right to choose path and was it worth it? What would people recommend I do going forward? 

Any answers to what seems to be a lot of questions would be appreciated, please help a very hormonal girl out 😭✌🏼",1,1766882641.0,ADHDUK,5,0.99,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

1pxdey8,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1pxdey8/90_days/,90 DAYS!!!,"I can hardly believe it. 90 days smoke-free today! I decided three months ago to finally stop smoking cigarettes (after 26 years of smoking 1-2 packs daily), and also decided to stop smoking mj (after 33 years of daily smoking). This is not my first attempt at quitting, but I feel like this is definitely my last. I truly believe this time there is no going back.  
Everyone has their methods, but for me the only way I have ever successfully quit anything I was addicted to, is cold turkey (23 years sober from alcohol and other drugs).  
The first few weeks/first month was extremely difficult. For me, the mental addiction is every bit as strong as the physical addiction. One thing that helped me get through it was reading every day about where my body/lungs were in the healing process. Knowing that my lungs are healing, is still helping me. At this point, I'm no longer having cravings or thinking about it nonstop. In fact, I barely think about it at all anymore except occasionally when it dawns on me and pops in my head and I'm like, ""Oh shit, I finally fucking quit killing myself with cigarettes!"". 
Another thing that has been very helpful is my little exercise routine I started. Nothing super strenuous, but it is something I have dedicated myself to doing every day, no matter if I feel like it or not. Just 10-30 minutes of walking or jogging (5 mins if I'm really tired, because something is better than nothing), 40-50 crunches, and 3 different exercises with some light hand weights.  
This sub was also instrumental in helping me through all those early stages of quitting. I'm thankful to all of you for the tips and for sharing your experiences and struggles. This is a very good support system. 
To anyone out there still struggling to quit, or in the very early stages; don't give up. You CAN do it! It sucks in the beginning, there's no way around that. But I just kept sticking with it, fighting through the mental and physical cravings. Drinking tall glasses of water, taking slow deep breaths, and going for brief walks also helped.  
For some, the desire for cigarettes/nicotine/the very act of inhaling smoke itself, may never fully go away, but I think with time it becomes minimal. Honestly, I'm ""only"" three months in and it's no longer consuming my every waking thought. Last night I dreamt I smoked cigarettes and woke up disgusted, not craving a cigarette. I can now watch TV shows or movies with people smoking and it's not a trigger. And triggers are huge when stopping anything you're addicted to. Especially with cigs; every damn thing was a trigger for me (sitting outside, talking on the phone, eating a meal, drinking coffee... everything!).  
But I stuck with it, and here I am; 90 DAYS SMOKE-FREE!! 🎉🚫🚬  
Wishing you all the best in your journey to be smoke-free!",2,1766882380.0,quittingsmoking,1,1.0,False

We’re both the most quiet and reserved people in the group and I think we kinda bonded over that, we also have a lot of similar interests. A month ago I asked him if he wanted to get coffee and he said yes and seemed enthusiastic about it too. we had a great time, we talked for a couple hours and he also paid for my coffee; I was going to pay since I was the one who invited him, but he just paid as I was grabbing cash out of my wallet. after that we went for a walk and stopped at a bookstore. He was looking for something new to read and he bought a book I recommended him. He also walked me part of the way home even though it’s out of his way (we live in opposite directions.) and I asked if I could hug him and he said yes.

Last weekend the school I work at had a band concert for Christmas so I asked him if he’d like to go and again, he said yes. We went to dinner after, earlier he had asked me if I ate yet and I said I hadn’t and said I wanted to treat him to dinner but then he got flustered saying I don’t have to. When we finished eating he grabbed the check and paid before I could say anything and then he walked me home again. A few days later I texted him that I had a great time with him and would love to get dinner again. We’re going tomorrow. I’m thinking about straight up telling him about my feelings but I keep going back and forth on it. I really like him and don’t want to mess this up.

I have one potential second round interview at a mid level firm but in preparation for that not going my way, should I start looking for AR roles as my first post grad job, get my CPA as fast as I can, and then reapply for PA firms a year into said AR role?

I’ll lead off with saying she was looking for a “life partner” or “long term relationship”. I thought she was cool and maybe I’m in the wrong here. I’ve not met her yet. But we have been very interested in each other and speaking romantically to some degree. Like when we started talking I deleted my hinge bc I was all about her … and I told her that. So it’s progressing the way these types of relationship progress. We’ve had a lot of phone calls and texts and stuff. But long story short she showed me this outfit she got for Xmas, and it’s pretty aggressive and sexy etc.. and she’s like I’m not wasting a Friday night. I’m going out to dinner by myself. And in my head I’m like “Jesus a woman looking that good alone at a restaurant on a Friday night, won’t stay alone very long “ and I said to her “Jesus you look really great you’re gonna get snatched up out there lol” hoping that she would be like “oh know it’s been established I’m very interested in you don’t worry about that lol” but no that obviously wasn’t the case. So anyway she goes out does her thing I send her like a selfie or video or something and she’s just radio silent the entire night. And we had plans to hang out THIS SUNDAY. So morning comes around… I’m depressed af I sleep into until 3pm nc I was just like what the f*** ever… might as well depression sleep the day away. She texts me in the am. Sending me a screenshot of her friend or whatever saying “oh with the ice blah blah blah blah, can we hang out Sunday and work on that thing” or whatever. So she asked me to reschedule to TODAY. But I woke up at 3pm . So it was much too late obviously. And also why are you trying to reschedule plans this early into a relationship atmosphere? I should stress that we ARE (so I had thought) romantically interested in one another. So we were supposed to go roller skating and get coffee together and she’s like sent me a video of her in her rollerskates like twerking and shit saying “I def still have the skills” and I’m just sitting here like “dude you left me in silence last night, with the worst of thoughts and made me feel like I wasted my time on some woman who wasn’t ready to settle down, and NOW YOURE TRYING TO RESCHEDULE OUR plans” I didn’t say that but those are my inner thoughts. I’m 36 years old old. She’s 33z we are both ADULTS IN OUR 30s I thought this party BS would be behind us… I’m just depressed because I really really really liked this woman and it seemed like she had accepted me for me. But I’m not the kind of person for my own mental well being that benefits from being left in the dark all night after you say you’re going solo out for dinner. And then ignore me the entire evening. I guess I’m not looking for something like that. Evening like a basic text responding to me saying “oh funny” or “oh yeah I had a good time, now I’m just at home chillingly something. I literally only send her a selfie , and a video of me saying something just basic lol but the lack of care. I just want to know the other person values what the same things that I do… communication. Basic respect. As far as I’m concerned it’s just a HORRENDOUS first impression.  I might have picked the wrong person…. And I guess that’s on me.. but I just get so lonely like all I do is work.. that I’m a glass half full kind of guy and just want to find a respectful person who is my best friend and enjoy spending time with… so she just texted me asking “are you alive 😂” and I just don’t know what to say… I just don’t think I’ll text her again. I don’t feel good about the whole thing… don’t get me wrong guys. I’m not a prude, I’m not a controlling person I’m not angry in any way in relationships. But communication is so important to me. I’m mentally not always the most tip top shape. My mind thinks the absolute worst. And I’m starting therapy. Although my mind does think that way I don’t voice these things to the other person I don’t send crazy texts or abusive weird words lol I just internalize my thoughts.. idk … I got out of a safe 8 year relationship that was full of trust and respect. And it ended mutually/amicably we are still very good friends. So I guess I mistook that for assuming that modern dating and women are all kind of good natured.. but I also might be making a mountain out of a molehill… please don’t tear me apart too much in the comments i promise I mean nothing but well.

1pxd7bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/loanoriginators/comments/1pxd7bm/how_to_get_out_of_being_a_mortgage_loan_officer/,How to get out of being a mortgage loan officer?,"Hi, My background is 25+ years in the financial services industry. Started in retail banking, spent 13 years doing Bank Secrecy Act and regulatory compliance. Was bored with that and jumped on a mortgage loan officer position at a credit union. This was in 2020, the height of the low low rates. It was a whirlwind, made a ton of money and learned quickly how to get a mortgage thru to close. Move to present, I’m in FL and the market is different. It’s a constant grind to get deals and I just HATE the thought of cold calling realtors, the fake shmoozing, the coffee and lunch dates that I pay for. Only to have every other MLO vying for the same realtors and offering lunch and learns which I have no interest in doing as I feel realtors should stay in their lane and leave the loan process to us. I don’t ask them to do a lunch and learn for me on how to sell houses. I just view it as another way to get a free lunch at my expense. I have done extensive social media with no return on investment. The issue is I’m a great MLO on the back end, I have a very high close rate, I know the guidelines due to my compliance background and my customers love me.  I also have a college degree. 
I have tried to leave and find another bank job doing my “old stuff” compliance with no luck. I know I would miss the flexibility of my current job, but it comes with constant worry of when my next pay will come (I’m 100% commission). It would be nice to have steady pay and health insurance. I have spent the past four years hoping the market will turn and nothing. Is it impossible to leave this industry once you’re in it?  I am not interested in being an LOA or processor because those are all pay per file as well. I would have to find a super successful LO to keep me afloat. Anyone else feeling lost in this mortgage world? Anyone leave this and go to something totally different and love it??? ",3,1766881786.0,loanoriginators,3,1.0,False

I really miss you. I hope you are doing well and are suceeding in life with whatever you are doing. I look forward to hearing all about your life once we can reunite. 

I hope you have some good book recommendations for me. I can't believe I was able to actually sit down and read and enjoy books again. It's so hard for my brain to focus on them and I read but find myself having to constantly reread what I just read.

I look forward to being able to love you whole heartedly and show you all the love I have to offer. I got some massage oil warmers a few months back when I thought you may be pregnant for taking care of you. I want you to know, I absolutely intend to give you daily massages still. It's something I enjoy doing. I love physical touch. That's my number one love language. 

Some things I imagine are us cuddled up together drinking coffees and enjoying books or anime together. I imagine us camping even in the winter snuggled up by a nice warm fire. I imagine us going for cruises in our cars listening to music. I imagine seeing you driving my car and us taking turns on the racetrack by the Lake and see who can get the better track time. It would be such a scenic drive and weekend getaway. I imagine us sharing nice cooked meals and experimenting with new recipes on date nights. One of the first recipes I want to try making is real ramen. I imagine me learning how to make some fire ass food on a charcoal grill while you are inside prepping some sides or snuggling up to me on our patio furniture. I just gotta make sure I get a temperature thermometer to make sure I cook it evenly with varient heat lol. It will all be worth it. 

I love you Hanna. No matter how much I don't want to wait to see you and I want to see you now, you are definitely worth waiting for. I love you with all my heart.

We have started talking about meeting family and him meeting my child(7). He was in a relationship with a woman with a child previously. 

Today my daughter had a playdate in my home with her best friend. This kid is amazing, listens well and I love her and her family dearly. Her mom and I joke we share custody because the girls are always together. They even look the same.

I mentioned to my partner the girls were playing and he said he didnt sign up for 2 kids. And if we ever lived together he was not okay with ""strangers kids"" sleeping over or people over, really at all. 

I like my peace and I dont want people over all the time. But I do enjoy occasionally having a friend over for coffee and I enjoy my daughter's friend. Her mom and I always do something small but special for them. And they always listen and play in her room. 

And I always dreamed of being able to occasionally host bbqs and small get togethers.  He has made it clear he is not ever going to compromise on this issue. And I asked him plainly ""what now?""

He said he honestly didnt know.

I thought We were both feeling that we had finally found our person and would have happiness.  Occasionally having family and friends over doesnt feel like asking too much. I'm feeling so broken and checked out over this and haven't heard from him since the conversation (4 hours ago)

1pxd1t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pxd1t7/sfthe_keene_lattice/,[SF]The Keene Lattice,"Maggie didn’t notice the time until the building went quiet.

The campus physics lab had emptied hours ago, leaving her alone with the hum of the chilled water loop and the faint tick of cooling metal heat sinks. The containment rig sat in the center of the test bay, a ribbed steel frame wrapped with coils and sensor nodes, cables spilling out across the concrete floor.

“Last one,” she muttered, rubbing at the crust in her eyes as she keyed in the sequence.

Field geometry model, stable. Power draw, at the upper limit but within tolerance. Error margins flickered amber, then settled green. On the monitor, her equations stacked over the CAD model of the device.

She armed the test. The relay bank clacked in the control cabinet as capacitors came online.

“Come on,” she said. “Just give me thirty seconds.”

The countdown hit zero. The rig shivered as current slammed into the coils. Air pressure in the room shifted. The fluorescent tubes above buzzed louder, light warping at the edges of her vision.

Lines bent subtly inward, as if the room were trying to fold around an invisible point. A pen she’d left on the cart near the frame rolled uphill.

Then the breaker tripped.

The world snapped back into place as every light in the lab went out. The hum died, leaving a sharp, ringing silence. Somewhere in the building, a transformer let out a muffled thud.

“Shit.”

Emergency strips along the floor flicked to life, bathing everything in dim amber. Maggie sat there a moment, hands still resting on the key pads heart racing. She pushed back from the console, the chair’s wheels squeaking in the quiet.

On the tablet beside the monitor, the last readings froze mid‑spike. The power draw had leapt far beyond projected values in the final fraction of a second.

The final result of her experiment was a building‑wide power outage and a more than likely irate facilities manager in the morning. She shut down what she could manually, checking the rig for heat or damage, then grabbed her bag.

By the time she stumbled back to her cramped office, the clock on her monitor read 4:17 a.m.

She curled up on the dusty old couch beneath the whiteboard, still dense with integrals and diagrams, set her phone alarm for two hours, and drifted off

The alarm buzzed against her skull. Maggie sat up too fast and the room tilted, her eyes gummy, her neck screaming in protest from being smashed against the arm of the couch. Yesterday’s clothes were wrinkled and smelled faintly of coolant.

She splashed water on her face in the bathroom down the hall, then followed habit more than thought down to the ground floor café, guided by the scent of burned coffee and baked sugar.

The line was mercifully short. She tugged her hair into a loose knot, blinking at the chalkboard menu without taking any of it in.

“Rough night?”

The voice came from just behind her. Maggie looked back. The man behind her, one hand stuffed in the pocket of his work jacket, the other wrapped around a to‑go cup. He had a few days’ worth of stubble softening a strong jaw, dark circles under his eyes that mirrored her own, and a maintenance badge clipped to his chest: BEN HART, FACILITIES.

“Power techs love you physicist grad students.” he added. “Keeps us employed.”

Maggie winced. “That bad?”

“Campus grid logged a spike big enough to trip half the building,” Ben said. “Security report says ‘possible equipment malfunction in sublevel lab three.’”

“That’s… oddly specific.”

He shrugged. “They write it like that when they don’t want to blame anyone.”

She huffed a laugh despite herself. “I prefer ‘historic breakthrough’ on the form, personally.”

“You the historic breakthrough?”

“I was trying to be.” She shifted the strap of her bag. “Containment fields.”

“Like force fields?” Ben said. “Or like lasers and things?”

“No.” Maggie said. ""More like the stabilization of gravitational rifts. I have a theory that if you can essentially capture a black hole it can be studied closer. If I could just get the electricity in this facility to behave on my behalf I might stand a chance at completing my experiment in conjunction with a particle collider one day.”

He caught the flicker of irritation in her voice, not at him but seemingly at her work. He didn’t press, just nodded toward the counter.

“Tell you what, Dr. Historic Breakthrough, I’ll buy your coffee as an apology on behalf of the power grid.”

“You don’t have to.”

“I kind of do,” he said. “The guy who runs the breaker room was swearing about ‘those damn science projects’ at five a.m. There may have also been some name calling. Buying coffee for the culprit feels like balancing karma.”

""Name calling? Like what kind of name calling.""

""The kind that would upset my mother if I repeated it.""

The barista glanced up, waiting. Maggie sighed.

“Fine. Large black coffee and a dozen donut holes.”

The next few weeks blurred into a rhythm: days split between the lab and her office; nights that stretched a little too long; text messages from Ben that lured her out of the building with promises of real food.

He’d swing by the lab at odd hours under the pretense of checking the breaker panel. Sometimes he actually did. Other times he leaned in the doorway, watching her coax the new, reinforced rig through its startup sequence.

“Explain it to me like I’m an idiot,” he said once, arms folded, gaze on the coils.

“You’re not an idiot.” Maggie replied

“Flattery noted. I still don’t know what I’m looking at.”

She tapped a schematic on the screen. “Think of it as a net. You throw it over a region of space so that certain things, fields, forces, particles have to behave inside it. They can’t propagate the way they want to. It’s not a wall. More like… rules that only apply in there.”

“And last time, the rules blew a fuse.”

“Last time, I underestimated how much juice the rules needed.” she said. “I fixed it.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You sure?”

“No,” she admitted, and he smiled.

Later that night they grabbed beers at the dive bar four blocks from campus. He told stories about growing up in a town where the tallest building was the grain silo. She talked about the first time she saw a pair of iron filings dance inside a prototype field, how it felt like watching gravity forget itself.

On one of those nights, he walked her home through a slow drizzle, hands shoved deep in his pockets, shoulders hunched.

“So,” he said. “You gonna blow the lights again tonight?”

“I upgraded the power regulation,” she replied. “In theory, no but I know who to call if I do.”

“In theory.” He smirked.

The email came on a Thursday afternoon.

DR. MAGGIE KEENE – FUNDING OPPORTUNITY / COLLABORATION REQUEST.

The sender’s address resolved to a research foundation she’d never heard of, with a website full of stock photos and vague mission statements about “advanced energy solutions” and “environmental containment technologies.” The message itself was flattering without being specific, full of references to her thesis work and recent preprint.

At the bottom, a note: A representative will be in touch and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss your work in person.

She almost deleted it. She knew what it was like to deal with corporations. Then she looked at her current budget spreadsheet, at the highlighted red cells under EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT, and sighed.

The liaison showed up precisely at 10 a.m. the following Tuesday: mid‑forties, well‑cut suit, an institutional smile that never quite reached his eyes.

“Call me Harris,” he said, shaking her hand. “Your paper on localized field stability made the rounds in our organization. We’re very interested in what you’re doing here.”

“Your organization is…?”

“A private consortium,” he said easily. “We support research that has direct practical applications. Containment, particularly, is a field of… growing interest.”

He walked the perimeter of the rig, hands clasped behind his back, gaze lingering on the coils, the reinforced breaker panels, the new grounding straps.

“You’ve achieved impressive results on a minimal budget,” Harris said. “But this kind of work shouldn’t be constrained by institutional politics and grant cycles. Imagine what you could do with a dedicated lab. Clean power. Custom hardware. A team.”

“And the strings?” Maggie asked.

He turned suddenly toward her. His face changed, but remained the same. As if he had dropped a vail. There was a change in his voice too. It seemed sharper. More to a point.

“I knew you were a smart girl Maggie."" He replied. ""You see, some of my colleagues said this meeting was pointless. That a poor grad student such as yourself would beg for funding, but I said 'No, Maggie's a smart girl'. You asked about strings so here it is, ours are simple, you pursue your research. With any success we get first access to your designs. You of course still maintain all credit and can do what you will with your creation... after we get a look at it first.”

“And if I say no?”

“Then you keep fighting with university procurement for another year,” he said. “By then, someone else may have solved the same problems you’re facing. Less elegantly, of course.”

He met her eyes, and something flickered there: not threat, exactly, but a sense of inevitability.

“We’re offering you time and tools, Miss Keene,” he said. “What you do with them is up to you.”

Two years later, the rig she’d built with their money hummed like a living thing.

It no longer resembled the cobbled‑together frame in the campus basement. This one sat in a private facility an hour outside the city, where the walls were thick, the air always a little too clean, and security badges changed colors every three months.

They called it a containment lattice in internal memos, which made her want to crawl out of her skin. Just another thing that aggravated her about working there. If she was the one working the long hours and putting in all the hard work it was only fair that she get to name the device, but since she hadn’t, containment lattice it was.

She'd found a way to shape the field so it wrapped around irregular boundaries without collapsing, hugging surfaces no geometry textbook knew about. She’d watched test objects disappear inside and reappear unchanged, watched sensors report values that shouldn’t have been possible. Every new demo, a knock out of the park.

Harris approached her after one of these demos which just so happened to be in front of the board of executives.

""My my, you've come a long way Maggie."" He said. ""I have a request for you.""

""Oh yeah, what's that?"" She replied, her nervous system always lit up around Harris. Always on edge when he was nearby.

""What would you think about designing a Lite version of your containment lattice?"" Harris went on. ""We were thinking of something small and portable. Potentially for firefighter or maybe environmental use.""

“You’re not an environmental agency,” Maggie said.

“We contract with people who are,” he replied. “Your device can protect communities from dangerous conditions. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?”

Her skepticism showed on her face and in the quiet spaces of her mind when some of the data from “off‑site demonstrations” came back heavily redacted.

Still, she agreed.

 About a year later she had a refined and portable unit. She brought in Harris for a demonstration. As her team ran things in the lab she was in the observation deck with Harris.

""By trimming power requirements, and integrating a collapsible frame we've managed to get pretty close to what you were asking for."" Maggie explained.

The demo went off without a hitch: a simulated spillover from the particle collider, the lattice deployed, contaminants held in a shimmering, barely visible shell. A literal pocket held device now capable of containing a black hole.

Her team applauded. Harris shook her hand.

“Congratulations Miss Keene. You’ve done it again. I was thinking since we are fast accelerating out of the prototype range, have you thought of a name for your device yet?” He asked.

“The Keene Lattice.” Maggie replied.

On the drive back into the city, traffic thick with late‑day commuters, her phone sat heavy in her pocket. She kept touching it, checking the time, feeling a tight sensation building in her chest.

She let herself into the apartment she now shared with Ben just as the orange of late evening sky slanted through the blinds. He stood in the tiny kitchen, sleeves rolled up, chopping vegetables with more enthusiasm than skill. A pan hissed on the stove.

“You’re early,” he said, glancing up. “Did the universe tear itself in half and they let you go home on time for once?”

“Funny,” she said.

She crossed the room and kissed him with a heavy enthusiasm.

“Wow,” he said. “Either the demo went really well or you did tear a hole in space.”

“It went well.”

“Then why do you look like that?”

“Because,” she said, pulling back to pull a blue stick out of her purse. She put it on the counter beside him. “I’m pregnant.”

He stared at her.

The knife clattered onto the cutting board. For a second, the only sound was the pan on the stove.

Then his face broke open into a grin she’d never seen on him before, wide and bright and utterly unguarded.

“Are you serious?” he asked.

She nodded, sudden tears burning at the corners of her eyes. He grabbed her and lifted her off the ground, spinning her once in the cramped kitchen, laughing into her shoulder.

They talked that night until the food went cold: about names and rooms and what they’d tell their families about it, cribs and how they’d manage her insane hours.

At some point, the conversation drifted, like it always did, to the news murmuring from the muted TV in the corner.

“Did you see that thing about the Canadian town?” Ben asked, gesturing at the scrolling headlines. “Coldwater, I think? The whole place was evacuated. Underground gas leak or something.”

She glanced over. The banner read: COASTAL COMMUNITY CLEARED AFTER “SUBSURFACE EVENT.”

“That’s not exactly how gas leaks are usually worded,” she said.

Maggie’s phone buzzed on the table.

She picked it up, saw it was a message and the sender made stomach tighten.

HARRIS – SECURE.

Ben watched her expression shift. “Work?”

“Yeah.” Her voice came out thinner than she wanted. She thumbed the text  icons.

“It’s Keene, go ahead.”

“We need you back in,” he said. “There’s a deployment scheduled, and the field teams require instruction on the portable lattice. This one is time‑sensitive.”

He did not say where.

Maggie looked at Ben. He was already reaching to turn the stove off, the question in his eyes familiar: How bad? How long?

“I just got home,” she typed into the phone. “Can’t someone else—?”

Before she could finish her message Harris texted again.

“We need you now, I’ll explain more when you arrive.” Harris said. “We’ll have a car at your building in 10 minutes.”

Maggie stared at the screen for a moment.

Ben leaned his hip against the counter, studying her.

“I’ll pack you some food dear.”

She managed a small, strained smile. “I love you Ben.”

The car arrived outside just when it was supposed to. Maggie got in. Saw a brawny man in a suit in the driver seat.

“So where are we going?” Maggie asked.

“Classified, ma’am,” He replied. “I’m to drop you off at the executive helipad from there you’ll be with Harris.”

She sat in silence for the entirety of the car ride. Except when she would gasp at sudden movements the driver was making to get through traffic. The possibilities of what was so important and why it had to ruin her news with Ben. It only made sense it had to do with that gas leak in Nova Scotia. It was the perfect opportunity for another “offsite demonstration”. Maybe this time they wanted to take her with them. Maybe she’d finally get to see what her work was being used for.

When they arrived at the executive helipad Maggie wasn’t met with Harris, just another brawny man, this one bearded and tattooed  just about every visible place she could see.

“Where’s Harris?” Maggie asked.

“Waiting at the Hangar,” He replied. “He’ll explain more when we get there. It’s about a 20 minute flight from here.”

Maggie made her way to the idling helicopter hair blowing all around. 

The tall brawny man walking beside her bent her down so that she wasn’t standing straight up walking into the blades. When they got inside the man buckled her in, then himself. .

He handed her a head set and keyed in on his as the helicopter took off.

“Is this your first time flying?” He asked.

“How could you tell?” She replied without hitting the push-to-talk.

He mimed hitting the button to her so she knew what to do.

She keyed in this time.

“How could you tell?”

“Lucky guess.” He responded

“So what’s this about?” Asked

“Harris hasn’t told you yet?” He responded. “You’re gonna be teaching a monkey how to use that new device of yours to help with that gas leak in Canada.” 

“I’m sorry, did you say a monkey?” She replied frantically.

“Yep,” he said. “And I'm the monkey. Names Christopher Hale nice to meet you Dr. Keene.”

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes within you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.

There's a girl at uni I've been interested in for several months. I got to know her through a project we both worked on over a weekend together on at the beginning of the semester. I started noticing later that she would always look at me at the library and I started noticing her back and acknowledging her with a smile and sustained eye contact. I once noticed that she was looking at me from afar when I was walking with another female friend and when I turned she looked quickly away. I would talk to her a couple of times for 5-10 min and I would always notice that she did not seem in a rush to leave anywhere and I would eventually end the conversation due to nervousness. Another time, I accidentally walked past her without seeing her, while she stopped and said hello. I just noticed it was her right after, and then I started noticing that she started ignoring me while fully knowing I was there. I got the opportunity to apologize to her a couple of days after that since we both take the same bus home and she appreciated it while almost tearing up but everything went back to normal and we had a 15 min conversation on the bus home in which she seemed very happy when we parted ways after the apology. 

After months of this mutual acknowledgement and smalltalk (where she would share things with me in confidence), I finally asked her out for coffee via text at the beginning of this month. She responded after 20 hours saying she would be at uni on Saturday and that we could for sure go get coffee. The message seemed genuinely enthusiastic. 

I then followed up and suggested a specific time but she just never responded nor «read» the message. 

Monday I came to campus and saw her spending the whole day with a different guy (eating together, walking around). She tried to acknowledge me like nothing was wrong by constantly smiling in my direction but I just kept my gaze away from her direction. She spend multiple days around uni with this guy alone that week. 

I felt completely devastated and started not looking at her when she would pass in hallways/library. When she noticed this she got up shortly after and left the library much earlier than she usually does and went to study outside which is something she never does. 

A week later I briefly smiled at her while passing and she smiled back, but a couple of days later I once again did not acknowledge her due to nervousness when she was with her friend and she whispered something to her friend immediately after I passed by. Two days after that, she added me on LinkedIn and viewed my profile out of nowhere. 

I have no idea what to read from all of this, I really cannot move on without any closure. It’s keeping me from focusing on the holidays and everything else in my life and it’s almost been a month since she just never replied. ",1,1766881077.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

Some notes:

i refer to the crying child as Evan in this because that's just the name i prefer for him.

I also went with the theory that Michael was the one we play as in the game, mainly because i thought i'd be interesting narratively. 

This is only 3 scenes from it, and if i decide to fully complete it i do have an idea for a full movie script.

I didn't give Mrs. Afton a name, mainly because there is no reason to yet, but she might get one later on. If y'all have any good names for her i'd love to hear them.

I've been looking at those ones that have space for a coffee station in the middle along with cabinets and drawers. It would ideally go in space where the pink arrow is!

My question is though, most of the cabinets I find seem to be deeper than 10 inches, so would it be weird if the cabinet stuck out past that wall a bit? Most of the ones I find are 15-16 inches or so. We also have our water purifer where the blue rectangle is on the kitchen island, so I'm wondering if having the cabinet stick out from the wall will make it uncomfortable to access the water purifier.

1pxcv9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pxcv9j/aita_m27_for_being_quietly_upset_with_my/,AITA [M27] for being quietly upset with my girlfriend [F29] for her Christmas gifts and overall conduct,"My partner and I have been together since April this year. She's 29 and this has been her first proper relationship, whilst I've been through a couple of them before. She was very excited to share it and fulfil her fantasy of a romantic Christmas with me and to help her do that I said I'd spend Christmas day with her family rather than mine. Though I offered the invitation for her to spend boxing day with my family, but she declined preferring to spend it with hers. 

Before Christmas, we agreed that we would do a little 'couples Christmas stocking' to each other the week before in private, and a main present on Christmas day. 

Also in the run up, as I have a large family, I said to her that she didn't need to buy them all individual presents and that if maybe she helped contribute a few pounds to each I'd put her name on them as a shared gift. She agreed to this. Each present I got my main family members was between about £30-£50, she contributed £5 to four of them, so £20 total. 

In return however, she said quite strongly that I should get each member of her family individual presents, and ended up spending about £20 on each of them. Between 5 presents that was just over £100 spent on her family. 

For our Christmas couple stocking. I got her:
-A replica version of a cuddly toy we got on holiday together so she could have her own version
-A gift set of her favoute hair products 
-Her favourite box of Lindt chocolates
-Her favourite makeup but in a Wicked special collaboration, which she loves too 

Overall, my side went down really well with her but in return I got:
-A grey toothbrush holder
-A grey fitted sheet for my bed
-A cutlery set 
-A gift card for a coffee shop chain I don't use
-A novelty checkbook with little couples vouchers in

I was a little disappointed by this because with the exception of the checkbook, all the presents felt very arbitrary and uninspired and didn't reflect anything of what I know she knows I like or am interested in. We'd had a really nice day out and I didn't want to upset her so I thanked her for them and moved on without revealing to her I was upset a bit by it. I figured that whatever she had got me Christmas day would salvage it. 

Now, it's worth pointing out here, I know the monetary value in of itself isn't important, but I also felt that these gifts lacked any genuine sentiment or emotion to them. It's also worth saying as I know people will ask, we earn both good wages for our age. She actually earns slightly more than me. Neither if us are in financial difficulties and aren't usually that frugal or constrained. 

On Christmas day, I got her a new makeup box which she had been saying she needed a new one for months and again, she really liked it. I got her a nice one and it wasn't particularly cheap but I wanted to make her first Christmas with me a nice one. In return, I got... Two Christmas tree ornaments worth £2.99 each (the prices were still on). There was nothing unique or novelty about them they were just... Two Christmas decorations. That was it, no other surprises or shocks. My main Christmas present in its entirety. By contrast, she had spent well over £100 on her own brother with very targeted thoughtful presents related to his interests. I was completely heartbroken by it, even though I feel I shouldn't be, but I have lots of well known hobbies and interests and even a small thing a little bit attached to any of them would have meant a lot. But... I don't even own my own Christmas tree! So she's literally had to keep my main Christmas present for her own tree. 

In the couple of days since, I'm just left a bit hurt and very confused. I don't want to ruin her Christmas and an sure she meant well by them but I'm just baffled about how and why she came to the gifts she did and why they felt like such mundane things to get your partner on their first Christmas with you. I feel guilty admitting it but I do feel that the whole nature of this all has dented a bit how I feel about the relationship and am not sure if I should try and mention how I feel about it after new year but don't want to seem materialistic or petty in her eyes for being unfrateful",5,1766880856.0,AITAH,19,1.0,False

I grab my phone to call a locksmith… dead. Fine, I try the landline… and somehow it’s a toaster now.

So I figure, screw it, I’ll climb out the window. And right there? My neighbor’s holding a live goat in a tuxedo. The goat just stares at me like it knows what’s up. I ask about my keys, and the neighbor goes, “Oh yeah, they’re in the freezer… but you have to knock three times and hum the national anthem backwards.”

So I do it. Three knocks, backwards humming, open the freezer, and there’s… a single key. The keychain says it belongs to the Post Office. I try it anyway. Door opens… and I’m in the post office. Employees start scanning me and I get a tracking number.

Then my dog shows up, wearing sunglasses, riding a unicycle. It steals my tracking slip and pedals off. I’m stuck there forever, apparently. They finally let me leave, but I get back to my living room… and it’s underwater. Fish are swimming in the chandelier, my couch is a boat, and my cat is the captain. I have all my keys, but none of them work.

So I’m sitting in my underwater living room thinking, “Okay, this can’t get any weirder…” and the chandelier fish start singing “Happy Birthday.” I didn’t even know it was my birthday.

Then my cat shouts “Delivery!” and a pizza lands on my couch. But it’s alive. One slice opens, a tiny robot pops out, and it’s like, “Your taxes are due. From 1987.”

I try to read the audit form, but the ink is invisible unless I wore sunglasses made of pickles. Luckily, my unicyclist dog has a pair. I submit it, and suddenly the post office goats show up, now in judges’ robes, stamping everything. All fine… until they start fighting over who eats the robot pizza slice.

Then the living room folds in on itself, gravity stops working, and I float through the ceiling into a portal. I see myself in another dimension: same house, same keys, same cat—but everyone’s wearing socks on their ears. A booming voice tells me I’m late… again.

Then my couch-boat turns into a submarine, I’m swept into a coffee ocean, fish swimming in caffeine typing on tiny laptops yelling “Deadline!” Somehow, I get back to my kitchen. Pizza gone, goats gone, cat napping, dog licking its paw. Everything seems fine… except now my keys are tiny sentient creatures whispering about auditing my fridge.

And that’s when it hits me—I’ve been late on my taxes… in three alternate dimensions.",1,1766880744.0,OneTimeIDreamt,0,1.0,False

# Discover Local Coffee Roasters: Freshness in Every Cup

Tired of stale, mass-produced coffee? The secret to a truly exceptional cup lies closer than you think: your neighborhood coffee roaster. These local artisans transform green beans into aromatic perfection, bringing unparalleled freshness and unique flavor profiles right to your doorstep.

You'll find a diverse range of origins, roast levels, and even signature blends tailored to specific palates.

*   **Unmatched Freshness:** Experience coffee at its peak, usually roasted within days, not months, of your purchase.
*   **Unique Flavor Profiles:** Explore distinct tastes from carefully sourced beans and expert roasting techniques.

So when I scrolled past a throwaway comment — *“Playfina actually pays”* — my first reaction was an actual *snort*. Yeah, sure. Next you’ll tell me water’s wet and my coffee’s cold.

But it was 3 PM on a Tuesday. The kettle was boiled. My to-do list was judging me. So—purely as a stress test—I tossed in **$50**, loaded *Gates of Olympus*, and spun with zero expectations. Like feeding $5 into a pub machine just to hear the clatter.

Then the screen did something weird.

🔸 Spin 3: Scatter.  
🔸 Bonus round triggers—**80x**.  
🔸 Mid-free spins: *another* scatter lands—re-trigger. **+150x**.  
🔸 Multipliers start stacking—25×… 54×… 89×…  
🔸 Final cascade: **210x total**.

Balance blinked: **$11,300 AUD**.

No fanfare. No fireworks. Just that quiet, eerie silence when your brain hasn’t caught up yet.

I didn’t celebrate. Didn’t screenshot. Didn’t even move.  
My hand hovered over *Withdraw* like it was wired to a tripwire.  
*“Here it comes,”* I thought. *“The pop-up. ‘Please verify your birth certificate and maternal dental records.’”*

I waited. Refreshed. Checked email. Made another coffee.

An hour passed.

Nothing.

So I clicked **Withdraw → Litecoin → Confirm**—and braced for the usual aftermath: the email loop, the support ticket, the “we’ll contact you shortly” black hole.

Instead?  
✅ **31 minutes later** — *ping*.  
✅ Full $11,300.  
✅ No ID recheck.  
✅ No “congratulations — now wait 5 business days”.  
✅ Just cold, clean, irreversible crypto in my wallet.

That wasn’t the moment I got excited.  
That was the moment I got *curious*.

So I kept playing. Not chasing the high—just testing the *reliability*.

Since then:  
🔹 $872 on *Fire in the Hole* → withdrawn in 26 mins  
🔹 $3,200 tournament win → cleared same night  
🔹 $420 free spin promo → paid out in full (yes, really)  
🔹 92 Bonus Crabs claimed — all delivered, no fine print

What makes Playfina different isn’t the wins. It’s the *absence of sabotage*.

* Games don’t lag after you hit a bonus
* The UI doesn’t change every promo cycle
* Support replies in <90 seconds and *remembers your name*
* Withdrawals feel like a feature, not a negotiation

Other casinos *perform* trust.  
Playfina *is* trust — quiet, consistent, and utterly boring in the best possible way.

I don’t play there because I think I’ll win big.  
I play there because when I *do* win — big or small — I *know* it’ll land.  
No drama. No delay. No disappearing act.

Small, bootstrapped operation currently run by one guy and a growing collection of hobbies that rotate based on the season. Financially stable but lacking in work-life balance and someone to share meals with. Looking to scale.

---

**About the Role:**

We are hiring for the position of *Life Partner*. This is a long-term, permanent role with the possibility of eventual co-habitation, shared Netflix passwords, and building a life that doesn't suck.

This is a remote-friendly position. Location flexible. I'm based in Gurugram and haven't had a reason to move apart from the AQI and the fact that I already invested in a house here. But *you* could be my reason to move.

---

**The Founder:**

30M. Atheist. If caste matters to you for whatever reason, I come from a Hindu Jat family. It doesn't define much about me other than the gotras I need to avoid (so I don't accidentally end up in a romantic relationship with a super distant tribal cousin).

Left leaning. Feminist. Occasionally funny if you like puns and dry humor.

I work remotely in digital marketing for an LA-based agency. Earning around **30 to 35 LPA** from the agency alone, or more depending on how much freelance work I'm willing to take on.

**Hobbies include:** growing mushrooms at home, 3D printing things I convince myself I need, building IoT gadgets, street photography, long motorcycle rides with no destination (a skill I picked up at 26 because why not), and accumulating half-finished woodworking projects. I once played the bagpipes. We don't need to get into that.

**Personality-wise:** calm to a fault, especially in arguments. I don't yell, I don't say things I'll regret, and I'll actually admit when I'm wrong. I'd rather understand your side than win the fight. I talk a lot when comfortable, prefer depth over breadth in relationships, and value my peace more than most things.

**Ideal Sunday:** wake up late, coffee made the slow way, read in bed, tinker with something, and end the day at a quiet cafe with someone whose company feels effortless.

---

**Role Requirements:**

- Curious and opinionated (agreeing on everything is boring)
- Career-oriented or at least passionate about something (~12 LPA or above, because I'm not looking for a dependent, I'm looking for a partner)
- Plans on working long term unless we both hit our FIRE number and retire to a beach house somewhere
- Socio-politically liberal and not apolitical or lazy about it
- Can hold a conversation and a disagreement without it becoming a fight
- Finds my hobbies endearing rather than concerning

---

**Nice to Have:**

- Laughs at bad jokes
- Enjoys comfortable silence
- Doesn't need constant plans to feel like the relationship is working
- Can explain her own weird interests at length without apologizing for them

---

**Dealbreakers (About Me, Not You):**

*Putting these upfront so you can self-select:*

- I'm an atheist. Not the preachy kind, but I won't pretend to believe in things I don't.
- I don't care about astrology, kundli matching, or rituals that exist only because ""that's how it's always been.""
- I'm not in a rush. I'd rather find the right person slowly than the wrong one quickly.
- On kids: honestly unsure. Leaning towards maybe eventually, but not anytime soon.

---

**Compensation & Benefits:**

- A partner who actually listens
- Calm presence during life's inevitable chaos
- Dad jokes (unlimited PTO on these, unfortunately)
- Someone who will take really good photos of you
- Motorcycle rides if you're into that
- Freshly brewed coffee on most mornings
- A life that's peaceful, not boring

---

**How to Apply:**

DM me. Tell me something about yourself that a resume wouldn't cover. If we click, I'll share my number and we can take it from there.

*No cover letter required. Typos forgiven. Bots and scammers will be reported to HR (me).*

A lil back story. 
My stepdad had a major heart attack in 2021 and has since recovered. He now only has half hands and feet and has become frail due to a lack of everything other than coffee and cigarettes. 
My son who technically has no relation to him because he isn't even my dad he's my step dad. He's been a round since the 80s and I still don't call him dad he's john. 
Anyways Christmas day we arrive for Christmas dinner and everything is fine we hand out the gifts we brought for my gma and gpa ( mind you they can't even be bothered to get anything for the grandchildren) they are now 6 and 11. 
I usually buy gits for the boys from them because I already know there's nothing. I do understand they don't go out and couldn't handle being in malls ect but there is Amazon ect. So I'm not coming up with excuses for them I do think is b.s they can't even get the boys something, anything. It don't matter it's the thought that counts.
Anyways dinner was good, our time  was good. The 11 year old was already wanting to leave and we were gradually preparing our exit. ( Can't just eat and go) Our 6 year old was getting ancy and wasn't really doing much other then sitting in Mom's lap and wanting to leave. 
Then gpa starts with the you better listen to me and calm down yada yada. My son didn't even really know what was happening then he jumps up and moves his old and frail body across the room and places his hand on my son's head squeezes a bit then puts his hand on his mouth forcefully ( gpa is not a strong man at all but still) almost in a slap like I mean business and you better listen to me kind of way .. this cause him to cry and mom to stand up and take our son and walk out the door leaving me to kind of gather up our things and follow behind... 
I know we are not the ah in this at all I do know gpa stepdad is the ah. 
But I'm not sure how to proceed from this. 
Our son doesn't want to see him ever again and I know mom is just done. We are supposed to have them over for roast on newyears eve and I just don't know what to do. I spoke to him briefly yesterday in the phone and he said he was bothered by this and owes me and my wife an apology... But he didn't even mention our son, today u went there to get a glove my son left behind and gpa didn't even mention it.... I feel like we try to hard for this relationship and they can't even be bothered to get the kids anything at all and now this... I get it clearly the old man is a grump nowadays but really? Now what? Should we just forfeit or cards and quit playing this game? I dunno

1pxcq9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pxcq9r/i_dont_know_whether_to/,I don't know whether to...,"... kill myself now, or wait it out, and more than likely kill myself later.

See, my spouse (married in 2019, together since 2013) suddenly changed one night. Literally like a switch flipped. Laughing, playful, joking... then suddenly, their face darkened. They told me to leave them alone. Then, they attempted suicide. I saved their life.

It's only gotten worse.

Eventually, they told me, ""I don't know if I don't love you because I'm depressed, or if I'm depressed because I don't love you."" I'm not sure how to take that as anything but ""I tried to kill myself because we're together."" Rationally, I know it's more likely the chicken before the egg... they feel this way because they're depressed... but, it's hard to keep rational. I have mental health issues myself. Have since I was probably 8 years old. So, rational is hard to hold onto.

And rational doesn't fix anything. Not when things constantly escalate, more and more.

They blew all of our money. I made a separate bank account when I learned where, exactly, all the money was going. I was basically working to pay for their online affairs. To pay for their gifts to sex workers. It wasn't just their money they were spending on these people, it was mine, too. So I stopped them being able to spend my money. And, they finally stopped spending. I guess their income was for bills, and mine was for... that.

So, I had to start from 0. It was going fine enough. I still contributed a lot more than they realized to household expenses, which didn't click for them until they assumed I had $10k stashed away and I laughed. ""I pay the utilities. I buy the groceries. I buy all other random household odds and ends. And, I monitor your account. I see when you won't be able to cover a bill, and I transfer you money. You're shy $16? I send you $30.""

I don't think I transfer funds to protect them. I think it's to protect me. I don't want to lose everything before I'm ready for new things. Financially ready, anyway. I don't think I'll ever be emotionally ready.

Soon enough, I came home from work early, and there was someone in our home. Candles lit. Fireplace burning even though it was 65°f outside. Takeout on the table. And all evidence of me living there removed from the common areas. I was erased. So, that's when I talked to a lawyer. Told them what I want, what I have. Sounds like my divorce terms are reasonable, a judge would likely agree, and if spouse contested, I have enough evidence of infidelity and financial misuse to get my way whether they want me to or not. Basically, lawyer said it would behoove spouse to be amicable, because I'll get what I want no matter how it goes. I told my spouse this. The following day, they said the love me. Wouldn't let go. In our sleep, they were attached to me. For about a week, anyway.

I was going to start house hunting after the new year.

Then, my credit crashed. Turns out, my student loan was transferred to another creditor. They sent four letters to the permanent address I had listed... spouse's parents. Who have decided in the midst of all this, that I am the bad guy, and failed to inform me of multiple letters coming in to inform me of my loans being transferred. It had been in forbearance off and on, none of which I'd ever applied for, just automatically applied. So I didn't blink when the payments weren't coming out. Until I saw my credit drop 180 points for 90 days failure to pay.

I spent hours figuring out what was going on, what happened, how do I fix this? Figured everything out. Paid the balance and then some. But it doesn't matter. The damage is done.

So now, I can't buy a house in the first quarter of 2026. When i first told spouse I intend to leave, they said to take my time. They need time too, to get their own finances in a safe place. I didn't want to take my time. I don't feel safe anymore.

But now, now I have to take my time. I have to wait at least 12 months from the 90 late report if I want to buy a house. I can't even rent an apartment right now, thanks to this mess. For student loans my parents coerced me into taking out, when I never wanted to be in debt for school. For loans my spouse's family managed to weaponize against me.

Yeah, I should have updated my permanent address when we bought our home... that's on me. But I never thought they would burn the mail related to my loans when it came in, and never tell me. They always dropped our mail off at our house until everyone turned against me for... no reason.

It really is no reason. I've spent all year thinking about every possible bad thing I did, anything I did that could have been perceived that way. So much looking inward. But it wasn't me. It's just a toxic family I married into. A family who, no matter what, their blood can do no wrong, and it's always the outsiders who are the problem.

So now, I'm trapped. I'm stuck. The most recent escalation was 11 days before Christmas. They locked me out of the house with no shoes and no jacket, in my pyjamas, in 18°f. I'd gone out there because they'd taken my phone from me, took it outside, and pretended to shoot it with a rifle. While I desperately searched in the dark for pieces, hoping to recover the SIM or SD cards, they went back in, and locked the doors. All the doors. They eventually let me in. Gave me my phone back. That was when they ripped all the curtains down, ripping the rods out of the walls, and flipped the coffee table over. Shattering glass everywhere. I retreated to the bathroom to get away. I lost consciousness. Smacked my face. They broke into the bathroom, found me on the floor and covered in blood. Suddenly, they were caring again. Got me to the hospital. Kissed me when I was released. Was attached to me in our sleep.

But I can't do this back and forth. I can't wait until 2027 to get out. So, do I kill myself sometime in 2026? Do I hold on until 2027 and hope they don't kill me before then? I think I'm very likely to kill myself eventually anyway. Maybe a few months, a few years, into starting my new life. So why put it off? If not for holding onto this foolish hope that things will go back to how they were before I can leave.

I wake up often, thinking it's all just been a nightmare. But then the reality creeps in. This is real. This is happening.

And I don't think I'm going to live to see 2027. I don't think I want to, anyway.",1,1766880485.0,TrueOffMyChest,8,0.57,False

I (38 m) have been a sobbing mess and crying almost every day for the past week as I process all the emotions and my own lived experiences of being in the closet, fears of coming out and not being accepted, and longing for connection and the freedom to be myself. I felt I needed to post here as no one else around me has watched the show or read the books and needed to share with others who would understand why I’m so emotional. 

Thankfully, my lovely fiancé has been so supportive and helped me as I cry uncontrollably and babble about everything going through my mind and helping me process and put into words things I have never said out loud before.

I’ve had so many moments where I’ve had to remind myself that this is fiction and there are so many elements of these characters lives that we do not see. The parts that are “boring”, “every day”, “humdrum”… groceries, laundry, commuting, making a coffee, sitting in airports, quiet dinners alone… We only see the passionate moments, the “highlights”, the intense moments.

We also don’t see the months and weeks these characters spend apart, lonely and longing for connection with each other. Having to hide their sadness and depression from their teammates and people around them.

I’ve also had to be very intentional in reminding myself that my life is exactly what 18 yo me would have never even believed was possible. That I have an amazing partner, a home, friends, safe spaces, and the ability to be myself without fear. I’ve also been very intentional in showing and telling my partner how much I love him, being affectionate and also open when I’m feeling upset.

This show and the books have consumed me in a way I was not expecting and it’s going to take time for me to recover. I really hope I’m not the only one feeling this way and anyone else who is feeling this way is taking care of themselves.",13,1766880452.0,heatedrivalry,2,1.0,False

1pxcooc,https://i.redd.it/tmkeg0fb6u9g1.png,"The 20-Byte ""Heist"": Why Calling AI an ""Art Thief"" is Nonsense","The outrage over AI image generation ""stealing"" art is an emotional reaction divorced from technical reality. The truth is, calling an AI model an ""art thief"" is as absurd as calling a human memory a copy machine.

Let's break down the sheer impossibility of the claim. The widely-used SDXL image model was trained on approximately 400 million images. Yet, the entire model—its ""knowledge""—only requires about 8GB of storage for its weights.

To do the math: 8,000 megabytes divided by 400 million images. That breaks down to an average of **20 bytes** of data stored per image in the model's structure.

Twenty bytes.

To put that in perspective, the paragraph you just read is over ten times that size. A single, low-resolution JPEG of a coffee mug is orders of magnitude larger. Twenty bytes is less information than this sentence.

When you train a large language model, it doesn't save a thumbnail of every image it sees. Instead, it extracts ultra-condensed statistical patterns—the deep structure of ""what makes a wave a wave,"" or ""the common elements of a dramatic portrait."" The resulting AI is a brilliant, complex statistical abstraction machine, not a data storage locker full of purloined JPEGs.

To accuse the AI of ""stealing"" art based on 20 bytes of abstraction is to fundamentally misunderstand what machine learning is and how it functions. It's not a pirate with a hard drive full of unauthorized files; it's a highly compressed, emergent statistical *understanding* of human visual culture.

Next thing we knew he was a vegetable and got sent back to the US where he later died. What had befallen him is anyone's guess, but a former NK intelligence officer who had colleagues dealing with Warmbier was reasonably confident he had been drugged/poisoned so he couldn't disclose the conditions he witnessed in the NK prison system and thereby (further) ruin NK's international reputation.

Meanwhile, Australian student and former Pyongyang resident Alek Sigley was arrested for a couple of things including posting a tank toy on Instagram, threatened with death, but ultimately merely expelled from university and deported from NK, with a chief officer saying they didn't hate him but just his ""crimes"", and that, if he spoke good of NK going forward, perhaps they could see each other over coffee in Pyongyang one day.

Radically different outcomes, so what do you reckon were the factors?

I for one think Sigley had the crucial advantage of being fluent in Korean and knowing the culture, having spent significant time in NK and even operated a tour agency. This might've facilitated dialogue and contributed to de-escalating the officers' anger, perhaps even instilling a level of respect from them (they did essentially state they held no ill-will towards him, which I'm inclined to believe seeing as they could easily have done a Warmbier 2.0). In addition, the Swedish embassy, rather than hysterical US politicians, were involved in getting him out of custody; the Swedish embassy was the only western embassy for many years and thus has a relatively solid understanding of how NK functions.

(This is a long post, so I suppose it's only for those who like to read and are ready for detailed story/background information.)

Back in the summer of 2023, I was in the backyard playing fetch with the dog when a guy with the most intoxicating smile and blue eyes messaged me on Scruff. It turned out he lived in the city and was in my suburb for a party at a coworker's house. I was very impressed by how clever he was. As he was talking to me about possibly meeting, it eventually occurred to me that he seemed to be angling toward a hookup. At age 39, I just wasn't that interested in a hookup and was gently steering toward something more substantial to see if he'd entertain the idea. He seemed game, and we ended up FaceTime-ing when he got home from the party. We quickly bonded over the fact that we were both playing the new Zelda game, he had been a band and choir kid through the end of HS and I currently give private instrumental lessons, we had a very natural back-and-forth to our conversation, and we seemed to have promising sexual chemistry. He commented that I was very easy to talk to, and he was very physically attracted to me. I made sure to check with him that he was okay with the fact that I was 39 and about to be 40 in a couple weeks, since he was 29 and I was used to guys sometimes just looking at my pictures and not actually looking at my age. He said he was well aware of the age difference, that it was no problem at all, and that he wanted a date the next day, if possible.

I was excited about a date, and I had forgotten that feeling. The last time I had dated someone was about 13 years prior in 2010. After that didn't work out, I had spent my late 20's and my 30's building my career (usually working long days, 7 days a week), as well as staying on top of my fitness and trying to keep my physical health high. I was so used to not being interested in dating anyone that it was genuinely shocking to be so into this guy. At age 39, I was experienced enough to know that there was a difference between attraction over FaceTime and attraction in real life, so I told myself to not let myself get too giddy until 1) we had met in person and he could decide if he was still physically attracted to me, and 2) he proved that he was interested in something real and not just casual sex.

We met at an awesome independent coffee shop by his place the next day. I was totally mesmerized by him -- not only did he have that wicked smile and deep blue eyes, but I loved the curly hair from the Jewish half of his heritage, his cute ""slight dad bod,"" and the brilliant way he was able to discuss music. Eventually, we went back to his place and talked some more. I wasn't planning on anything sexual for the first date, but he convinced me to play ""strip Mario Kart,"" and we ended up having some incredibly hot sex. In the back of my mind, I thought, ""Well, this guy's incredible, but we'll see if this was just an ornate hookup or if he is seeing this as something more. He sent me an album he wanted me to listen to on my drive home, and I dutifully listened. After he got home from whatever he had going on after our date, he sent me a surprisingly long text message explaining why he had sent that album to me. Essentially, this man had hung onto several key things I had said during our date about what I like about music and how I listen to it, and he sent me something that he thought would both push me to explore in a new direction and appeal to some of the facets of music that I already enjoy. This man had officially made it through my defenses and I was all-in.

Over about 6 weeks, we shared and discussed several albums. A lot of his music was on the more alternative/emotional side. (He introduced me to Phoebe Bridgers and the other members of the boygenius collective.) We talked almost every day, and I liked hearing him rant about his frustrations at work and celebrate being acknowledged for doing his job well. I also distinctly remember on maybe our 3rd date, he asked me what I considered to be 2 very major questions: 1) What were my thoughts on raising kids, and 2) What were my thoughts on open relationships. I answered honestly, and he said he agreed with me. It really seemed like this guy was very genuinely into me. Then came our 6th date around the 6-week mark.

Everything started well and normal. He wanted to show me the photo editing work he had done for his parents over Labor Day Weekend. We went out to dinner and grabbed ice cream afterward. (I felt guilty about this because I had a half marathon coming up in 2 weeks, but I told myself to just go with it because this guy was so awesome and that is what mattered.) We then went back to his place, watched some TV with his hand down the back of my pants, helped his neighbor move a couch into her place, then went back inside his apartment and started making out. He suggested we move to the bedroom. I noticed he wasn't getting hard, so I tried to get him there. After a little bit, he said, ""I don't think it's gonna happen tonight."" I was a little surprised because I had come to know him as a perpetually horny guy, and in the past, the few times that had happened to a guy, he was always quick to offer up some kind of explanation. (i.e. ""I got off earlier today."" ""I've been stressed."" ""I take medication that can affect this."") Silence. I didn't want to bring more attention to the matter by talking about it, so I just laid next to him. I hoped that it would prove that I was all good with not having sex and that I was happy to just be with him, hopefully keeping him from feeling like he had let me down. (To be clear, I was absolutely not let down.)

He asked me to text him when I got home, so I did. When I didn't hear anything from him by the next morning, I felt like something was up. I texted him toward the end of the work day to ask how the day had been. He said it had been a busy day, but not stressful, and he wanted to know if he could call me around 7:00. My heart sank. ""90% chance he wants to end things, 10% chance that he wants to apologize for the awkward way the previous night ended,""I thought to myself. When he finally called, he said, ""So I don't know what happened last night, but something was missing. And I don't know what, but...you're such a great guy, and you deserve to have someone who can give you everything you want and everything you deserve to have."" Not only did I feel completely deflated, but I was caught off-guard. I was expecting to hear, ""I've met someone else,"" ""I'm just not ready for a relationship,"" or something along those lines. I was \*not\* expecting a vague reference to the previous night and then vague reasoning for ending things. I appreciated his attempt to be kind, responsible, and thoughtful, but after 6 weeks and a lot of sex on our previous dates, having a night that ended like that from a guy who had once texted me ""I think it's going to be some time before I'm not hard around you 24/7"" and had called me gorgeous 2 or 3 days before our final date was absolutely perplexing.

The confusion eventually turned to feeling like all my insecurities had been exposed and dialed up to 10. I became hyper-fixated on my physical imperfections, and I couldn't believe that yet another guy--one who felt like the best connection I had ever found, after a 13-year drought--had failed to make it past the 6-week mark, but it wasn't the usual ""we had a normal date, and then he ended things a bit after it"" scenario. The last thing I had experienced with him was him not getting hard. I began questioning whether or not all the compliments he had given me about my appearance and how much he was into me, in general, were even real. It was like I was witnessing my ability to trust people go down the drain in real time. I couldn't believe \*this\* was the way things were ending with this guy.

In the time since, I've slowly done some healing. (Watching YouTube videos by some good therapists was helpful, and Esther Perel's podcast should be regular listening for nearly all adults.) Each month gets better for me than the last, and that is good news. But I have never heard of such an out-of-left-field, dysfunctional end to dating happening to any of my friends. As a man, I think it's terrible form to let things happen like that. At best, he was embarrassed about not getting hard and was willing to throw everything away over it. At worst, he suddenly couldn't deal with my physical imperfections to the point that he, a total horn dog, couldn't get hard around me. I just think it was really irresponsible of him to open the door for a guy's mind to run wild like that. I think the age gap just opened the door for that to be an even bigger wallop for me. It took me a while to realize that the blow to my ego was another major factor for me. I'm used to being the guy that resists dating anybody--the guy everyone knows to be perpetually single. I finally found someone I wanted, and it's like we were just cruising along up in the sky, only for the plane to get shot down for now apparent reason.

I started adding the gym on top of my running routine at the start of 2024. It's certainly transformed my body some, and that has given me somewhat of a confidence boost. But no matter how many guys compliment my appearance, it's hard for me to take those compliments seriously anymore. Nonetheless, I'm glad that the gym gave me a positive goal to focus on. Self-improvement is a great way to deal with the emotional fallout of a relationship not working out, regardless of how far along things got.

Anyway, thanks for reading my tediously long TED Talk of a post. If anyone has had similar experiences with gay men or has come up with good coping strategies, I'm happy to hear them. I know people talk about the arrested development of gay men, their delayed emotional development, etc., but if this is going to be gay dating in modern times, it seems pretty unsustainable to me.",4,1766880022.0,AskGaybrosOver30,14,0.7,False
1pxcie6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1pxcie6/the_one_that_didnt_get_hard_then_got_away/,"The One That Didn't Get Hard, Then Got Away","I went through a difficult ""end to dating"" just over 2 years ago, and I'm curious if anybody here has had a situation like this happen and how they dealt with it. (This is a long post, so I suppose it's only for those who like to read and are ready for detailed story/background information.)

Back in the summer of 2023, I was in the backyard playing fetch with the dog when a guy with the most intoxicating smile and blue eyes messaged me on Scruff. It turned out he lived in the city and was in my suburb for a party at a coworker's house. I was very impressed by how clever he was. As he was talking to me about possibly meeting, it eventually occurred to me that he seemed to be angling toward a hookup. At age 39, I just wasn't that interested in a hookup and was gently steering toward something more substantial to see if he'd entertain the idea. He seemed game, and we ended up FaceTime-ing when he got home from the party. We quickly bonded over the fact that we were both playing the new Zelda game, he had been a band and choir kid through the end of HS and I currently give private instrumental lessons, we had a very natural back-and-forth to our conversation, and we seemed to have promising sexual chemistry. He commented that I was very easy to talk to, and he was very physically attracted to me. I made sure to check with him that he was okay with the fact that I was 39 and about to be 40 in a couple weeks, since he was 29 and I was used to guys sometimes just looking at my pictures and not actually looking at my age. He said he was well aware of the age difference, that it was no problem at all, and that he wanted a date the next day, if possible.

I was excited about a date, and I had forgotten that feeling. The last time I had dated someone was about 13 years prior in 2010. After that didn't work out, I had spent my late 20's and my 30's building my career (usually working long days, 7 days a week), as well as staying on top of my fitness and trying to keep my physical health high. I was so used to not being interested in dating anyone that it was genuinely shocking to be so into this guy. At age 39, I was experienced enough to know that there was a difference between attraction over FaceTime and attraction in real life, so I told myself to not let myself get too giddy until 1) we had met in person and he could decide if he was still physically attracted to me, and 2) he proved that he was interested in something real and not just casual sex.

We met at an awesome independent coffee shop by his place the next day. I was totally mesmerized by him -- not only did he have that wicked smile and deep blue eyes, but I loved the curly hair from the Jewish half of his heritage, his cute ""slight dad bod,"" and the brilliant way he was able to discuss music. Eventually, we went back to his place and talked some more. I wasn't planning on anything sexual for the first date, but he convinced me to play ""strip Mario Kart,"" and we ended up having some incredibly hot sex. In the back of my mind, I thought, ""Well, this guy's incredible, but we'll see if this was just an ornate hookup or if he is seeing this as something more. He sent me an album he wanted me to listen to on my drive home, and I dutifully listened. After he got home from whatever he had going on after our date, he sent me a surprisingly long text message explaining why he had sent that album to me. Essentially, this man had hung onto several key things I had said during our date about what I like about music and how I listen to it, and he sent me something that he thought would both push me to explore in a new direction and appeal to some of the facets of music that I already enjoy. This man had officially made it through my defenses and I was all-in.

Over about 6 weeks, we shared and discussed several albums. A lot of his music was on the more alternative/emotional side. (He introduced me to Phoebe Bridgers and the other members of the boygenius collective.) We talked almost every day, and I liked hearing him rant about his frustrations at work and celebrate being acknowledged for doing his job well. I also distinctly remember on maybe our 3rd date, he asked me what I considered to be 2 very major questions: 1) What were my thoughts on raising kids, and 2) What were my thoughts on open relationships. I answered honestly, and he said he agreed with me. It really seemed like this guy was very genuinely into me. Then came our 6th date around the 6-week mark.

Everything started well and normal. He wanted to show me the photo editing work he had done for his parents over Labor Day Weekend. We went out to dinner and grabbed ice cream afterward. (I felt guilty about this because I had a half marathon coming up in 2 weeks, but I told myself to just go with it because this guy was so awesome and that is what mattered.) We then went back to his place, watched some TV with his hand down the back of my pants, helped his neighbor move a couch into her place, then went back inside his apartment and started making out. He suggested we move to the bedroom. I noticed he wasn't getting hard, so I tried to get him there. After a little bit, he said, ""I don't think it's gonna happen tonight."" I was a little surprised because I had come to know him as a perpetually horny guy, and in the past, the few times that had happened to a guy, he was always quick to offer up some kind of explanation. (i.e. ""I got off earlier today."" ""I've been stressed."" ""I take medication that can affect this."") Silence. I didn't want to bring more attention to the matter by talking about it, so I just laid next to him. I hoped that it would prove that I was all good with not having sex and that I was happy to just be with him, hopefully keeping him from feeling like he had let me down. (To be clear, I was absolutely not let down.)

He asked me to text him when I got home, so I did. When I didn't hear anything from him by the next morning, I felt like something was up. I texted him toward the end of the work day to ask how the day had been. He said it had been a busy day, but not stressful, and he wanted to know if he could call me around 7:00. My heart sank. ""90% chance he wants to end things, 10% chance that he wants to apologize for the awkward way the previous night ended,""I thought to myself. When he finally called, he said, ""So I don't know what happened last night, but something was missing. And I don't know what, but...you're such a great guy, and you deserve to have someone who can give you everything you want and everything you deserve to have."" Not only did I feel completely deflated, but I was caught off-guard. I was expecting to hear, ""I've met someone else,"" ""I'm just not ready for a relationship,"" or something along those lines. I was \*not\* expecting a vague reference to the previous night and then vague reasoning for ending things. I appreciated his attempt to be kind, responsible, and thoughtful, but after 6 weeks and a lot of sex on our previous dates, having a night that ended like that from a guy who had once texted me ""I think it's going to be some time before I'm not hard around you 24/7"" and had called me gorgeous 2 or 3 days before our final date was absolutely perplexing.

The confusion eventually turned to feeling like all my insecurities had been exposed and dialed up to 10. I became hyper-fixated on my physical imperfections, and I couldn't believe that yet another guy--one who felt like the best connection I had ever found, after a 13-year drought--had failed to make it past the 6-week mark, but it wasn't the usual ""we had a normal date, and then he ended things a bit after it"" scenario. The last thing I had experienced with him was him not getting hard. I began questioning whether or not all the compliments he had given me about my appearance and how much he was into me, in general, were even real. It was like I was witnessing my ability to trust people go down the drain in real time. I couldn't believe \*this\* was the way things were ending with this guy.

1pxcey4,https://i.redd.it/8no973a54u9g1.png,"The 20-Byte ""Heist"": Why Calling AI an ""Art Thief"" is Nonsense","The outrage over AI image generation ""stealing"" art is an emotional reaction divorced from technical reality. The truth is, calling an AI model an ""art thief"" is as absurd as calling a human memory a copy machine.

Let's break down the sheer impossibility of the claim. The widely-used SDXL image model was trained on approximately 400 million images. Yet, the entire model—its ""knowledge""—only requires about 8GB of storage for its weights.

To do the math: 8,000 megabytes divided by 400 million images. That breaks down to an average of **20 bytes** of data stored per image in the model's structure.

Twenty bytes.

To put that in perspective, the paragraph you just read is over ten times that size. A single, low-resolution JPEG of a coffee mug is orders of magnitude larger. Twenty bytes is less information than this sentence.

When you train a large language model, it doesn't save a thumbnail of every image it sees. Instead, it extracts ultra-condensed statistical patterns—the deep structure of ""what makes a wave a wave,"" or ""the common elements of a dramatic portrait."" The resulting AI is a brilliant, complex statistical abstraction machine, not a data storage locker full of purloined JPEGs.

To accuse the AI of ""stealing"" art based on 20 bytes of abstraction is to fundamentally misunderstand what machine learning is and how it functions. It's not a pirate with a hard drive full of unauthorized files; it's a highly compressed, emergent statistical *understanding* of human visual culture. The real bad guy here is hyperbole, not the algorithm.

I studied for about \~2 weeks primarily using nursehub subscription and quizlet. I will say tho that i alr semi studied for this exam over the summer but I didn’t end up taking it then.

**A&p (100%)**\- I did the nursehub lessons and the 10 practice quizzes at the end. They were pretty similar to the exam and helpful for sure, but the quizlets were super helpful bc they had word for word questions from the exam. I will say I took a&p 1&2 a couple months ago so this information was mostly a refresh for me.

[ https://quizlet.com/1065213298/hesi-a2-anatomy-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/1065213298/hesi-a2-anatomy-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)

Every single question on the first link was on my exam. And the 2nd link had a lot of them too. Thanks to these I recognized single question. Other helpful quizlets: [ https://quizlet.com/902181887/hesi-a2-anatomy-physiology-2024-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/902181887/hesi-a2-anatomy-physiology-2024-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)

There were no pictures and nothing about the specific parts of the bones like Nursehub did in the lessons (ex. Humerus, femur, ulna, etc)

**Biology (96%)**\- I just look bio this past semester so it was pretty fresh on my mind. I did the 10 practice tests in nursehub and also used quizlet. Again, nursehub was helpful for understanding concepts but I found a quizlet with word for word questions which was great.

[ https://quizlet.com/1063737839/hesi-biology-2-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/1063737839/hesi-biology-2-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)

There was a question about the healing vitamin, and pretty sure the answer was vitamin e NOT A (I got that one wrong). Know that strep throat is caused by bacteria, know hypertonic/hypotonic and water moving out/in the cell, there were 2 questions abt the microscope (one was stage and other was stage clips), nothing on photosynthesis,

**Chemistry (100%)**\- I also just took chem this past semester so it wasn’t too bad for me. Used nursehub 10 practice quizzes and quizlets, but I think the quizlets better prepared me personally.

There was 2 molar mass questions with elements Fe, Cu, O, S, N, (I think one was Cu(NO3)2? And Fe2(SO4)3 was 399.1 g/mol) so memorize those atomic masses from the periodic table. There was a question about Calcium chloride and sodium carbonate and what precipitate it makes (know how to turn the written formula into molecules and predict the products (CaCl2 + Na2CO3 -> CaCO3 + NaCl) answer was CaCO3. Know m1v1=m2v2 for one question that was like “1L of 3.60M h2so4 stack, find volume for 12M stack” (answer was 0.300L). Know acids change litmus paper blue to red, bases red to blue. And equal amounts of OH- and H+ need to be added to neutralize the base. Didn’t have any half life questions or anything about nuclear radioactivity.

**Math (96%)**\- a lot of fractions, proportions, and conversions (gallon man saved me), percentages, oz in a pint, converting from fractions to percentages to decimals, etc. nursehub 5 practice exams were really helpful

⁠A farmer has 240 acres at $188.99 per acre. If he cultivates 60 bushels  per acre, with $5.67 per bushel, how much revenue will he generate? Answer was $36,290.40 I think.

I didn’t get any Roman numerals but I had like 3 military time questions

**Grammar (98%)**\- only did the nursehub lessons and the practice tests at the end. I would say it was pretty helpful. Just make sure you read the questions carefully. Know lie/lay, who/whom, it’s/its, bad/badly, good/well, continuously/continually etc. There was a question about mail formatting so know that (Mr. John Ryan, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, DC 20003). Didn’t get anything on predicate nominative/adjective or direct/indirect objects

I also didn’t use this but after taking the exam this seems helpful and has some questions straight from the test

**Vocab (96%)**\- I only used nursehubs practice tests and I definitely should have branched out. Had to make a few of educated guesses bc I didn’t know any of the words in the answer choices (guessing game strong tho 😛😛) words like efface, avid, credulous, cast, plaudit, lampoon (I literally thought this was a made up word bro). Use multiple resources for this section!!

**Reading (88%)**\- my lowest score 🥲 I used nursehub practice quizzes and quizlet. Passages I had: the water cycle, Golden Gate Bridge, voices, coffee, circus, exams, food, game of bridge, getting a good nights sleep, one dollar bill, phobias, factories, Amazon rainforest, healthcare. For this section ESPECIALLY be mindful abt quizlets/studuco bc I found many of them to have incorrect answers. I was just second guessing a lot of my answers and I think reading the passages beforehand on quizlet messed my head up. I would say nursehub is a good tool, but make sure you evaluate your weaknesses (ex. Finding the main idea, making conclusions) and utilize nursehub/other study resources to work on that. Also don’t assume: use the information they give you to get to your answer.

As for actually taking the exam, you get 4 hours total and you can choose the order you take the sections. You can take breaks but your time keeps running. And you can’t go back once you’ve answered a question. I took my harder sections first (personally- was reading, grammar, vocab), then the easier stuff (math, a&p, chem, bio) bc I didn’t want my brain to be fried then still have to use a bunch of brain power yk? It took me 3 and 1/2 hours but I also am a slower test taker. It does tell you your score as you finish each section which was alittle nerve racking but 🤷‍♀️

**My takeaways**\- quizlets were really helpful for knowing exactly what type of questions I was going to see but PLEASE BE MINDFUL a lot of them have mistakes including (some) of the ones I put links for. For something more objective like the science subjects it was pretty easy to notice those mistakes/search them up, but I found it harder to know if the subjective reading quizlets contained any mistakes but just be aware. Don’t trust every quizlet you see with all your heart. NURSEHUB was great, even tho the quizlets helped with knowing the questions, I still think I would have done great without them bc nursehub’s practice exams AND the rationales explaining each question (⭐️⭐️⭐️) were super helpful for understanding concepts.

The first morning I was the same jolly fellow, I think, to my sons and wife. But privately my brain and I had a few testy conversations.

I made a resolution last New Year’s Eve to give up coffee. I only did it because my family had dared me. They are not kill-joys – they said my consumption was excessive and “bad for my health”. The word addiction was bandied about. I thought that was a bit much, maybe there was the odd cup or two that I didn’t need but, overall, I was in control. I could stop any time.

“You will put the coffee bean wholesale market in freefall,” said my son, Andy. The other son, Sam, said my eyes twinkled when I had a cup in hand, but was positive that going cold turkey would be a good move. “What will ignite you now?” my wife Alice asked. “It’s your conversation starter.”

They all agreed I couldn’t stop. I will show them, I thought.

My family may have gotten me in a weak moment; laced by once-a-year champagne. Perhaps excessive pride and trust in my mental faculties *may* have contributed. The next morning I was the same jolly fellow, I think, to my sons and wife but privately my brain and I had a few conversations. Something like “... you are going to give up coffee, really?” We kept that to ourselves as we watched my family all enjoying large coffees at breakfast. That was mean, I thought.

Prior to my resolution, I drank as much coffee as I could. My day would start with an engine-starting strong espresso and then a strong latte with breakfast. Mid-morning I would have an espresso; then another with lunch, and a latte with dinner. If I was out with friends or family and was asked if I wanted a cup, I would quickly accept the kind offer. I was having five or six cups a day; sometimes more, sometimes less.

Experts often advise [no more than about five cups a day](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/nutrition/ask-the-expert/how-much-caffeine), but I wasn’t convinced I was suffering negative effects from all that coffee. I’ve always been a poor sleeper anyway. Some people say too much coffee can make you a bit hyped up, yet I’ve always been a helter-skelter sort of guy. My sons often say there isn’t a moment I wouldn’t be doing something at speed: going up the ladder to check tiles on the roof, cleaning the garage, walking around the block four times at pace, speed reading the paper etc. I just make good use of my time. Chit-chat with the neighbours was quick, my mind buzzing, what’s next?

If you subconsciously label coffee’s effects as anxiety, you might reinforce the trauma.Credit: iStock

I love coffee. The smell is intoxicating, almost better than the taste. That first sip. It delights the mouth and leaves you with an “all is good with the world feeling,” however long that lasts.

The first week was difficult. Drinking anything is just a habit I told my family, but my body had more to say about this. The headaches started and became worse as the days dragged on. And they did drag on. A day without coffee seemed like more than 24 hours. I was taking more paracetamol than ever before, I became quite insular, and I was even bad-tempered some of the time. Moi? Andy said I whinged about everything.

A 32-year study of more than 47,000 women has found a link between drinking coffee and healthy ageing.Credit: Getty

I began making my opinion known about everything: politics, grocery prices, the driving habits of others, the parking habits of those who reverse into car spaces. A neighbour whistling was driving me bonkers. In a fog I may have said that Tim Winton and Richard Flanagan couldn’t write and that AI wasn’t too bad. The house needed repairs that I didn’t have the time or drive to do.

On January 20, Alice and I were out walking along the local strip. I was hoping I could ignore the cafes full of people happily conversing with a simmering latte or a magic to hand. I wanted my life back – to be part of this coffee culture – while Sam and Andy had told me that morning that living at home had become a nightmare and they wanted their lives back. But I had my pride.

We walked past two cafes but it was the third, Kat’s, that got me. A friend waved me over to his street side table to discuss the latest cricket news. I failed to hear a word he said. A beautiful aroma was wafting through the takeaway window and I may have begun to drool. The sirens had won. I approached the counter and the girl seemed to understand perfectly, welcoming me with “What can I get you?” in a caring way. I reckoned she had seen all this before in the days after New Year’s Eve. Shaky souls seeking release from their demons.

My voice quivering, I delivered the wonderful sentence I’d been waiting 20 days and 20 nights for.

*“Could I have double-shot latte, please? Large, three-quarter full.”*

The aftermath was better than any perceived failure of not meeting my commitment. Bliss.

I had failed with my resolution but realised that I needed to start listening to health advice if I was to see 70. I’ve since scaled back to three espressos a day and the family seem pleased. Perhaps my experience was the breakthrough I needed.

No more resolutions for me, though. If you have one, I wish you all the best. Just don’t even think about giving up coffee.

I stayed quiet at first, thinking ""You don't even know this guy's target language.""  Then the woman suggested he listen to reggaeton.  So that answered that question. But still, I didn't have a sense of his learning preference or even how motivated he actually was.  

Then he told her, ""Well, I have been watching things like Sesame Street.""  Well, was the ticket.  I turned around and said, ""Sorry to be nosy but I have to say you might want to try Dreaming Spanish .com.  I've been using it for 3 years and I went to Mexico in April.  Had a great time.""  I explained it's like watching videos that are easier than Sesame Street but more engaging because they are designed for grown ups.  He looked psyched, took out his phone and typed it in right away.

Are there any good apps that don't charge you a ton of money for character recognition or to look up meanings?

I have an old installation of kanji recognizer, and jisho app. The former lets you draw kanji, but it won't let you do searches by character or reading because they're ""premium features."" Ewww, capitalism.

Jisho doesn't let me draw, but it has a decent dictionary that lets you search if you type the word. So you can draw in the other app and then laboriously copy paste into the other. Together the two apps let you look up most words for free. It's just a pain needing to use two of them! 

I couldn't get split screen to work with the two apps! It would be easier to keep them on the same acreen. On a newer Samsung phone I can open nearly any app in a separate window. Maybe I can't because I'm still on an old version of Android that only lets you open certain apps (mostly Samsung ones?)

I like to study in coffee shops, but I am afraid to connect this device to public wifi because its so old and far behind in security patches. Since I found a good deal on a newer phone too I might use that one as my kanji dictionary if it's more convenient....

My Samsung Note 3 still has a good battery and even if it's slower I think maybe I could at least carry it as a backup? The screen is perfectly fine and clear and it still has the screen protector! I'm glad they had that folding plastic faux-leather case that has gone out of fashion since it kept it from being scratched.

I can't believe that I paid over $150 for an electronic Japanese dictionary back when those were a thing that was much harder to use to look things up with than this! I'm sure people have tried doing this before so feed me suggestions and tips.

Seriously, I hate e-waste and i'm open to suggestions to give it a second life! At least tell me how to use this thing as a better learning tool! I'm behind the curve on using phones for learning!

Last week our assistant manager quit out of nowhere with no notice, we are already short staffed. Our Assistant manager called me and told me she was going to our managers boss and telling her everything that was going wrong. My other coworker, (21F, also a shift lead) was also there listening. After hanging up with my old assistant manager. The idea of me and my other coworker going to our managers boss was also brought up. So we decided to make a list on everything going wrong. I, thought it wouldn’t go anywhere so i told my coworker i wasn’t going to the boss but helped write a few things down on the list before giving it over.
My coworker and I made a few jokes about one of us being assistant manager. But then she had to go outside to talk to her mom on the phone about taking a shift on her requested days off. When she came back in, she said she couldn’t and to tell our manager that. But then her mom brought up how my coworker could be general manager ( with no experience.) That she should go to our managers boss and it’d do good. 
Personally, my coworker isn’t the best at her job. She rarely works and when she does, it’s half assed. 
So i went and told my manager about my coworker contacting my managers boss because id rather die than even have the thought of having my coworker be the boss. My manager said she’d talk to her, and everything. But now they talked, and my coworker is deflecting it back on me. I know i did help write part of the list but that’s because i thought we were just talking about things we didn’t like that were done a certain way. I don’t expect her to go to our managers boss with it. Now my manager is giving me the cold shoulder and i feel as if i have to own up to something i generally don’t think is wrong. I didn’t go to our managers boss, i didn’t even expect my coworker to go to hr or our managers boss. But now i feel like im the asshole for not telling my boss i helped write the list.

Sometimes he’d open my office door and talk to me, lingers thru . But when I invite him to work with me in a bigger area, barely comes. Prior to this he opened up about a personal matter . And shortly after I went to check on him and to let him know I’m all ears basically. 

when it’s just the two of us, he behaves this way hovering, smiling, bringing snacks, lingering, even making long eye contact.

He kissed me for the first time after our second date (restaurant that he boooked and chosed, followed by some drinks in bars).

We’ve kissed multiple times since, hug often, and our dates have included dinners, an escape room, a jazz concert, and movie nights, where we just snuggles for hours. 

We exchanged books as birthday gifts and have had open, meaningful conversations about relationships, red and green flags (his being communication and mine overthinking), and our personal values (loyalty, honesty).

He’s an introvert and not very good at texting outside of our dates. I usually initiate conversations and plan when we see each other, though he’s always responsive and suggests alternative days if he’s unavailable. He never cancelled or else. Even if his texting is slow, he is always consistent. 

On our last date (last weekend before the holidays), I went to his place for dinner. 

He cooked (made sure he cooked food that respects my diatery restrictions), I brought dessert and drink, and we had some great discussions, he shared some big thing with his work (stressful week for him), past relationships (both moved in quite fast with our ex's), and life in our thirties. 

We ended up watched a movie (the third of a sequel we both like, and we had watched the previous two together at my place during previous dates), cuddled the entire time, and eventually made out for a good 5 minutes. As it got late, he asked me if I wanted to spend the night, and we cuddled throughout the night and morning, and we did not have sex.
He offered to make a coffee in the morning, which I refused, hugged him and went home (I was travelling to my family the next day).

After I got home, I texted him to thank him for the night; he read it but didn’t reply. 

The day I was travelling (the next day) I send him a picture of me at the airport, and he replied wishing me a safe flight. 

We both didn't text each other since (5 days) as we were both with our families (I was in a different country. 

I feel like there’s real chemistry and emotional connection between us, and I see potential.
However I really in my head and have a hard time understanding if I'm imagining things. 

I am also unsure whether I should wait for him to reach out and make plans when I’m back, since I don’t want to always be the one initiating and carrying the relationship forward.

I early on mentioned I wanted to take things slow and he also shared being more an introvert. After our 4th date, I texted him saying that I enjoyed what was going on between us and that on my end I didn't feel like talking with anyone else. To which he replied ""being totally fine with taking time to figure things out"". 
Also, before our last date - I had mentioned that we didn't need to act like teenagers regarding kissing etc (I'm always a bit shy, I don't know why), to which he agreed to hype things up, and was being casual because I had mentioned wanting to take things slow.

My mother always worries about me since my face is tense and dry, too. She always tells me that my face has the tension of an adult and that I should be more carefree. Sometimes when anxiety hits me, I deal with it by tensing all my muscles and clenching my fists, since it really works. But then I don't want to live like this, I really want to be able to just live in peace without this much tension and lack of carefree.

I sometimes look at people who are just so calm, peaceful to be around, and have a strong sense of security, and I really do wish to be like that.

Maybe it is just my life that is so stressful since I have lots of responsibilities. Maybe I am the problem for seeking a vague sense of peace and focusing on myself this much. But I really am at a loss for solutions and even understanding what I am feeling.

So far, I have tried to engage in meditations, incorporate even breathing in my everyday life since I notice that whenever I feel anxious, my breathing tends to stop, creating a feeling, and replace every single negative thought I get with a positive one. I also experimented a bit with stoicism.

But all of this feels so tiring, and I am still tense. I do not know if I have to persevere through my new routine for long-term benefits. Or if I am better off not caring about how I am feeling. Or if I should instead just ""let go"" even though it worsens my anxiety.

Hope my post is clear. And it could also be that I drink 400mg of coffee every day, not that this is in any way negotiable.

1pxbmu3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxbmu3,ISO Stanley lid,"Hello all!

I’m looking for a new lid for this mug. I bought it probably 10 years ago, and the item numbers I’m about to list have changed due to mine being older. When I search the number on the lid it comes up with something entirely different that won’t fit. The number on the bottom of the cup does bring up the same cup but with a different lid. At some point the little black seal on the inside part got lost and now dumps coffee out, which prompted the search. 

Lid number: 30-01213

Cup number: 20-00717

Here’s catch number 1: It seems that a more recent version of this cap has been recalled, but my numbers don’t match up to the ones listed under the recall so I can’t get a new lid for free under the recall.

Catch number 2: my husband only likes this exact lid, and doesn’t mind the safety concerns. If anyone can find something even remotely similar (he doesn’t like flip open lids or the slide lids) that would be amazing!

1pxbma2,https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/1pxbma2/my_brother_hates_networking_events/,My brother hates networking events.,"My brother is a Senior Associate  and the pressure to start generating his own book of business has been stressing him out for a year. He is a great attorney but he absolutely hates the sales aspect: the bar mixers, the cold emails, the forced coffees with people who will never refer a file.

I am a software engineer, so I looked at his problem as a data issue.

I realized that waiting for an RFP is a losing game. He needed to find the General Counsels who were about to need outside counsel, before they even posted a job opening or called a firm.

So I wrote a script to do the digging for him.

It monitors a specific set of distress signals, things like specific regulatory keywords in earnings call transcripts, WARN notices, and even C-suite departures in his target sector. It filters out the noise and just flags the companies showing actual pre-litigation symptoms.

Instead of sending a generic checking in email, he reaches out with ""I saw X happened, here is how we handled that for a similar client.""

He has been using it for about three months and actually landed a substantive meeting with a GC last week purely off a signal the script caught.

I am currently just running this locally for him, but I am curious: do other practice groups have specific early warning signals like this? I am trying to see if the logic holds up for things like M&A or Restructuring. I am not trying to turn this into a SaaS (**I'm not selling**). I am just curious to see if the filter works outside of his specific niche.

1pxblz1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxblz1,Ferritin supplement recommendation,"I am here for a while know and I read that a lot of people are asking for supplement recommendations or saying that they took supplements but ferritin didn’t increase or only increase a little bit over several months. 
Some people also said that infusion is the only solution to increase.

So when I got older my doctor gave me „ferro Sanol duodenal“ and 2023 he gave me the highest dosage possible for my weight and I had to take 100mg iron two times a day so 200mg iron every day till the next appointment. 
He also gave a second pill to take too if the stomach isn’t taking it well (I can’t remember the name but I didn’t take it).

To be honest I didn’t take anything until a few weeks before the next appointment because I didn’t want to but my mother told me the doctor said I would have to get infusion if I don’t do that so I was afraid. So a few weeks before the doctors appointment I took 3 pills a day out of fear. You are also not allowed to drink coffee or black tea (my favourite tea) the whole time but I still did it once a day. 

The few weeks were already enough to raise my ferritin from 4 to 48 ng/ml. So my ferritin got more than 10 times higher! 
My hemoglobin raised from 9.5 g/dl to 11.2 g/dl.
MCV, MCH, MCHC and hematokrit raised too. 
I still wasn’t in the normal range but if you take into consideration that I only did it for a short time it’s still good. So with longer time I could increase even more. (I included pictures)

A lot of people are saying that supplements don’t work or ferritin only raises a little bit after 6 months, but it’s not true. I think it also depends on if it’s medication prescribed and from the pharmacy instead of the things you get at the supermarket or drugstore. 
The body definitely CAN absorb iron from supplements and I also read that iron absorption INCREASES when the body is iron deficient.

1pxbiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1pxbiet/this_is_the_3rd_time_ive_sworn_i_heard_my_husband/,"This is the 3rd time I’ve sworn I heard my husband coming home, and it’s not him","Hi everyone, I’m wondering if any of you have experienced something similar and have any advice. About a week ago, I was meditating getting ready to do spellwork, when I heard keys jingling, the front door opening, and then footsteps around the house. I assumed it was my husband coming back from the gym, and called out to him when I noticed he didn’t come to say hello to me. I got no response. I thought it was weird, but didn’t think much of it. He ended up coming home about an hour later.

Then the very next day, it happened again, this time while I was working—keys jingling, door opening, footsteps around the house. I called out, no response. He came home about an hour later.

I told him about it, and he kind of jokingly asked if that meant he was going to die. I said no, it doesn’t work like that and we laughed it off. It didn’t happen again until today (about an hour ago). I was laying in bed, not asleep, just resting — when the SAME thing happened— keys jingling, door opening, footsteps around the house. This time I hesitated to call out because I had a feeling I’d get no response again. But still, I decided to after a while, and of course, no response. He just came home a few minutes ago. (This only happens when I’m here alone.)

The thing is, it doesn’t scare me. I know very well it could be a spirit, but it doesn’t at all feel malicious so I just let it be. It’s probably also important to mention that I’m a medium, and have had spirit and paranormal activity all my life, but since really focusing on my witchcraft and learning how to use my gifts, it’s been significantly less — probably because of my home protections + I’m simply no longer without proper training and basically being an “open door”with no boundaries. I know how to properly work and communicate with spirits now.

But while I was laying in bed, I suddenly remembered why my husband probably reacted that way when I first told him about this. His father died when he was young, and the night before his death, his mom thought she heard the front door opening while he was out working night shift, then heard a bunch of noise in the kitchen — like pots falling over, cabinets opening, etc. But when she called out, her husband wasn’t home. He came home the next morning from his shift and passed away after drinking a cup of coffee on their kitchen floor. They said it was heart failure. I have made contact with his father once during a mediumship session my husband asked me to do, and we definitely confirmed it was him, but I ended up being under trance for over 2 hours and couldn’t decipher the last message I got, so I closed the session, went to bed, and woke up with a terrible migraine the next morning. I haven’t heard from him since and my husband never has in his life other than through me.

So even though I wasn’t scared at all at first, that memory made me anxious. I said a prayer to Archangel Michael and petitioned him to protect my husband while he came home, and sure enough he did come home safely. But now I’m just confused on where to go and what to do from here.

My first thought was divination, but I’m honestly kind of nervous to divine on this. I don’t want my anxious mind or this memory of his father to blur my judgment of the cards, and possibly just worsen my anxiety.",5,1766877210.0,witchcraft,3,1.0,False
