He takes my breath away.

I eat less and give him my food, my chocolate, coffee, cake because I love the way he eats it. I love the way he enjoys it. It’s like I get to feed happiness.

Our conversations are endless. He roasts me, I roast him right back. We challenge each other, tease each other, care for each other in the weirdest, most unexpected ways. It's fun and exciting and warm and intense all at once.

He holds a place for me in the metro line because I walk slow. He carries my stuff in his bag without even blinking. He defended me in front of everyone, even when the one being rude to me was his Best Friend.

And he tells me things… things he hasn't even told that 1 best friend. Little secrets. Random thoughts. I hold them like fragile little treasures.

He doesn’t look like the men you'd see on magazine covers. But God, he is so beautiful to me. Even if the most “perfect” looking man stood next to him, I’d still only be able to look at him. His tiny eyes, that smirk he holds it’s all I ever want to see.

But here's the thing nothing will ever happen.

There’s no hope. Not even a sliver.

And yet… I’m still here. Willingly walking toward a heartbreak, just for the privilege of spending time with him. I know how this story ends. I know it's reckless and maybe even a little pathetic. But I’ve never felt this way for anyone before.

So yeah… God help me.

Fateful decisions

I sat in my truck,, my eyes lost in that thousand yard stare  that had become the normal end of a day for me when there wasn’t really enough time or energy for the next thing on that ever growing to do list.   So much of that energy was being consumed in that ever raging battle going on between my ears,  one that left me with little hope, little rest and little enthusiasm for much of anything else.   Of late it seemed like these mental shut downs were coming earlier and earlier in the day.   Maybe it was the heat, maybe it was the lack of sleep, but it was far too early in the evening to be staring vacantly at the windshield in front of me and still somehow managing not to see anything at all.    

It had been about two months since I had cracked my egg…..those first weeks of euphoria and joy that it might be actually possible to exist as some version of me that I actually liked had soon faded, washed away by the river of tears that telling my partner had unleashed.   The storm cloud unleashed by that revelation had swept into our relationship with it a cold and harsh truth.    That nothing is that simple or easy.   That as much as I might want this…..nobody else in my life would and I would be faced with the hard choice of risking losing everything that I loved……for what?   A dream that I didn’t even know if it could actually come true?   Sure it seemed like it could come true for others, but how certain could I be that it would for me?   How sure could I be that it would be worth whatever it cost?   This was the firefight that raged in my head as I sat there…….mostly avoiding going back to a house that was feeling less like home with each passing day.  

Once the river of tears had subsided, my partner had set into the issue with the usual methodical approach she used to deal with nearly everything in life.  She began to do her research online and then quickly decreed that both of us needed to be in counseling.   Our conversations began to feel more like interrogations than the relaxing banter of two partners once the work was done.   I wasn’t doing particularly well with the questioning .  Part of it was a retreat into the familiar emotions of self-loathing and shame that had surrounded by existence for the last thirty years of my life….part of it was feeling like I was being crammed into boxes courtesy of  whatever the latest google search  had yielded for her.   I was beginning to feel like so much of the online narrative didn’t really fit me at all.    No..I didn’t want to paint my nails, or have her do my makeup, or have my ears pierced……the last thing I wanted to do was look at the mirror and see a guy in drag staring back at me…..that had always been the thing that had gutted me to core on those times when I had cross dressed….the thing that had filled me with far more shame than the fact I had tried on women’s clothing.   I simply wanted to exist as I was….but as a woman…..or at least as close as I could get.   I just sure I wasn’t sure I would survive that attempt.

  It had already become fairly clear that our relationship wouldn’t, she had quickly moved to the position she loved me….but our relationship was over if I decided to transition.   Her body language suggested that our relationship was already over…those small touches of intimacy, those gentle windows into the kindness our souls hold for each other had all but disappeared from our day to day interactions.   At night when I wrapped my arm around her, she no longer snuggled into it…but lay still and motionless until I finally withdrew it and she could get herself wiggled into a more comfortable position to fall asleep.   This was the death of a relationship in real-time, the slow painful business of watching the most beautiful thing in my life dry up and whither in front of my very eyes….knowing all too well that I was the poison responsible.    My words, my thoughts, my wishes and desires…..my very existence.   In that one conversation I had shattered the illusion of the person she thought she shared her life with, right now she was heart-broke and angry at the world ….and somehow I completely understood.     And hated myself for it.

She had been able to find a counselor fairly easily, for me it had been much more difficult.   Some of that difficulty was the fact we lived in a fairly rural area, some of the difficulty was the fact that I had a healthy fear of the vicious natures of small town rumor mills.   At the time the VA was being a little more generous regarding this topic, and I had reached out to them with a request for counseling……but like nearly everything else with the VA it was a lengthy wait to do anything…including even being contacted back sometimes.   Eventually I had been able to find a counselor in a city an hour away, but so far those conversations had been far from productive or helpful…..it seemed like she wanted to talk about anything but why I had sought counseling in the first place.   It was becoming apparent that she thought her job was to convince me to be happy with the body I had without trying to change it.   I was supposed to practice saying positive affirmations in the mirror.   All of it rang so hallow and flat.   I’d spent thirty years of my life (the portion I could actually remember) hating my body and knowing exactly why and how I wished it was different.  It hadn’t gone away in all that time.   These weren’t things you could change with diet or exercise.  There was a chance that maybe they could with HRT.    I was hoping to either get access to HRT and help navigating the social difficulties that would surely entail……or get slapped upside the head hard enough with reality that I quit wanting this.     Neither seemed to be happening or even likely to happen at all…certainly not a recommendation for hrt…...all we seemed to be doing was wasting time.  Time I didn’t really have.   In between sessions I would listen to clips on you tube or podcasts while going about my daily tasks.     When I had used the term dysphoria, that revealed to my counselor I had been trying to do research on my own on the internet.  She became indignant and told me that I needed to quit trying to look things up on the internet, that doing so wasn’t going to help anything.   I decided I was tired of wasting my time visiting with her once a week.   My partner decided that was a sign I wasn’t even trying anymore.   Our home had taken on a sense of living death….one that hasn’t quite happened yet….but one everybody knows is inevitable…..but doesn’t really want to talk about.    That was what I was trying to avoid as I sat here in my truck not yet going home….that and all of the guilt and sorrow and self-hatred that came with it.  

It was getting harder and harder to turn that key over each night.   Everything seemed to so impossible….why was it that what my heart wanted more than anything else in the world…..had to be this?   Had to be something that so much of society considered morally and physically disgusting…an insult against the God who had created me…..A lie.   Everything about the society and culture I lived in told me that I should get over this nonsense and quit thinking about these things.    Everything about the society and culture I lived in told me I was an awful person for the fact I was thinking about these things.   Inwardly I knew…..I probably wouldn’t….I hadn’t managed to quit thinking about these kind of things in the thirty years I could remember…..it’s just, things had gotten so much worse since I had found out that I actually could do anything about it. 

I’d always lived those voices in the back of my head…..at least as long as I could remember….the ones that told me that I should just punch out and let that time card flutter to the floor….that the world really didn’t need me in it,  that the world would be better off without me in it,  that the people I cared about would be better off too….all I ever managed to do was drag them down……all I was capable was making them as miserable as I was..   Those voices had been pretty loud the last several weeks, morphing from their normal good morning hello waiting to be drowned out by coffee into a constant cacophony that left me feeling so exhausted and defeated.   So far in life I had managed to weather their call out mostly out of duty….there was also was one more task that needed done first……I didn’t want to force somebody else to have to pick up the mess of unfinished tasks and projects I was responsible for…..didn’t want to force somebody I knew to have to clean up the mess of a successful suicide.  I wasn’t sure how many times I had heard that admonition that suicide was for those who were too selfish to care about all the pain they would leave for everybody else in their lives.   In some ways I knew that was true….I’d seen the way it left deep scars in families that lasted for generations,   known personally the way the suicide of one of the soldiers I had served with had left me with the sorrow of senseless waste and the guilt of wishing I had reached out, the guilt of thinking maybe, if I had been a better friend I would have known he was even struggling.   I didn’t want to leave that for my family…didn’t want to leave the trauma of having to find my body or have to identify it….I’d done enough hard things in life to know it was pretty hard to un-see bodies.   I didn’t want to do that to them.   The voices called out….”Do you really think any of that is worse than having a grown-a@@ kid who decides to become trans?”   There was a whole host of slurs that came with that one that seemed to be despised at a whole different level.   My family was fairly religious,  I wasn’t sure which was worse…..to have a kid who offed themselves because they were failure versus spending the rest of their lives listening to the whole town talk about what a failure that kid was…..and how much they had failed as Christians in teaching said kid how to live  his life.  

   I didn’t know…..just that I was tired of this battle…tired of the same voices every night…tired of the same problems that never went away.     Tired of feeling dead inside…..that spark of hope that had come with finding out that being transgender was a thing some people survived had run smack dab into some fairly serious questions of whether I would.    I wasn’t so sure….I was already struggling….I’d always struggled…..what made me think I was strong enough to make that journey?   What made me think that journey would be worth the costs?   The alienation?  The scorn?   The choice to be something it seemed that so much of society completely despised?   By now I had given this idea of an alternate me a name…..Everything about the culture and society I lived told me I should kill her….to bury her so deep she could never came back….never threaten to ruin my life again.    Somehow that felt just as heavy as the idea of taking my own life……Maybe heavier.   I actually wanted to be her….I’m not sure I had ever wanted to be me.   

A few days later I blew out the candle on my birthday cake.   Forty years….without a whole lot to show for it….at least not a whole lot I was particularly proud of.   Someone wise cracked….”Make a wish.”   And for the first birthday in my life….I actually did.   I wished I could actually do this…..and then I pinched out the candle because it was one of those annoying ones that kept coming back to life and I didn’t really want to cover the top of the cake in spit.  

A week later I started hrt…there was a certain amount of fear and apprehension as I let the pills dissolve under my tongue….I was trying to DIY with grey market materials I was able to obtain without a prescription…definitely not a route I would recommend.  There were reasonable questions of whether the pills I had obtained actually had the levels of estradiol and progesterone claimed to be in them or whether there was anything else in them that might kill me or otherwise ruin my life.  It was a risk.  I wasn’t sure why I was okay with taking it.   Was I desperate?   Just reckless by nature?   I wasn’t sure, only that I hoped this path led in the direction I wanted to go.  

In truth it only sort of did, sublingual delivery would be an incredibly ineffective route for me….I would spend the first two years of my journey self-dosing at levels well below where they needed to before I finally started working with an endocrinologist.  Doing HRT has been so much effective since.   The decision to start HRT without being upfront about it with my partner or seeking her approval would be the final blow to our relationship,  one that destroyed what little grace or trust she was still willing to extend me.   Of all the regrets that have come with this path…that is one of the heaviest….Her rejection and departure would end up stinging far less than the knowledge that she deserved far more respect and truth than I gave her and that I truly do deserve her contempt….not for being trans but for the ways I failed to live up to the basic tenets of relationships….honesty, communication, care and compassion.   That weight, and the weight of watching her heart break will be mind to carry for a long time……..a long, long time.  

Whether I survive this journey will always be  “still to be seen.”   Everything about life is uncertain, I have lived a life that has taught me far too well that tomorrow has never been promised….that each day that comes is a privilege and a blessing….an opportunity we make daily get to make a choice in how we spend.  That each time we make it to nightfall with the same number of friends and loved ones as we began the day with is a luxury….a luxury that somewhere, somebody won’t receive.   In truth, for me, those voices never went away…..but they have at least quieted down…..content to simply exchange morning greetings or poke their head in during rough patches.   Eventually I was able to get that counseling from the VA,  During one of those sessions I told my therapist that suicidal ideation and I were like old friends…neither of us really scare each other anymore… we might talk to each other fairly frequently but  both of us know I won’t actually do anything.   She didn’t seem to think that was nearly as humorous or as amusing as I did.   All the same, I’ve learned that so much of making through it…is simply hanging on….one day at a time....and if you can’t believe that things could ever get better for you….then you hang on to try to protect the people you care about…and when even that fails….for spite and stubbornness………..and believe it or not, sometimes it really does get better.  

For me, it would get better.  It took a while, it took some work, but somewhere along the way I learned that I could be a person worth liking, that even …..even if I was trans, that I could be kind and considerate, that I could still make people laugh, that I could hold my head high, that my-self-worth and relationships with other could be determined by my character and conduct and not just a label or whatever stereotypes people might have associated with that label.   There is so much in life I’m not particularly proud of, but there are also things to be proud of.   I will include in that small list, the storms I have weathered, maybe not the fact those storms existed,  there was certainly room for improvement in the way I weathered most of them, some of them were of my own making….but I’m still here, still trying to learn and grow, still trying to learn how to become a better person, still hoping I can help make the world a better place, even if I’m not always sure what exactly looks like.  Maybe some of that is just privilege or luck, but I’m starting to understand is a heck of a blessing.  And somewhere along the way,  I’ve discovered I’m capable of still having some really good days, that life really is worth living.  ",8,1751810128.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

1lt1qox,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1lt1qox/honest_review_of_msc_magnificia/,Honest review of MSC Magnificia,"MSC Magnifica Review

Hello everyone, we are a mid thirties  (American) couple that did a 7 day cruise on the MSC Magnifica that started out of Naples, IT. We boarded a week ago and disembarked today. For those that are unfamiliar, this ship has passengers embarking and disembarking at various ports on the ship for the duration of the trip. This provides a variety of benefits and setbacks depending on the topic. 

What you can expect is an honest transparent review from a couple who has been on 3 cruises together from varying cruise lines.

Boarding and check-in

The boarding process was rather simple but left you wanting more in some ways. The process was rather uneventful, but it did seem like a budget version of check-in compared to other cruise experiences (royal & celebrity). There were an over abundance of staff for the amount of folks boarding the ship for check in and the overall process from walking into the terminal and walking on board was about 20 minutes. A perk of offset embarkations for sure!

Once we walked onto the ship, you are bombarded with all the usual suspects. Drink package sales, restaurant sales, etc. Overall, it was a weird boarding process as we were the only ones boarding and it felt like we booked on an empty ship. Once we cleared security, we had no idea where to go and no one was there to direct us on next steps. 

A quick note, the cruise was very prompt on all port times excluding the final day. The crowds were not able to disembark until 20 minutes after the posted time and there were a lot of stressed folks crowded and gathering near exits worried about meeting their excursions and other timetables.

Balcony Room

Once we got to our room, we unpacked into our balcony room on the 10th floor. The room was similar to a traditional cruise balcony room minus a few things. 

1. The bed was very hard and unrelenting. If we were staying more than a week, we probably would buy a topper or something. I routinely woke up with back aches requiring stretching. (Not out of shape).
2. The pillows were very thin and it is recommended to bring your own or ask for more pillows if you prefer fluffy ones.
3. The air conditioner seemed to stop working on one of the nights and it was very warm in the room. We had a technician come to the room and stated it’s hot all over and other rooms are experiencing similar issues. The temperature was 11 degrees (F) over the average. He adjusted the flow and it seemed to be better within a hour.

Food

Let me start with some information concerning my wife. She has celiac disease which requires her diet to be gluten free. 

There are a total of 4 dining options available to all of the guests. I can speak to 3 of them as a higher cruise status was required to eat at one of the restaurants.

Buffet

The buffet was available almost 24 hours a day. It closed at 02:30 daily. We used the buffet mostly for breakfast and after dinner hours. For some occasions, we saw the dinner options at the buffet were the same as the included restaurant option. 

PROS: They had fruits, yogurts, bread, and main dish options.

CONS: 
- The coffee was below average. It is a cup you would drink because it was the only  option. 
- The absolute biggest complaint: the after hours menu included zero gluten free options. They only offered packaged bread after asking 3 workers. It was definitely a friction point during this cruise. 

Main Dining Room 

PROS: The restaurant staff was an absolute highlight. (Shoutout to Rayzon, Edwin, and Felix) They were absolutely courteous and welcoming. The lead waiter worked with my wife directly for her gluten allergy and ensured it came out of the gluten free kitchen. 

CONS: We had lunch on the last day with different staff members, and my wife ordered the GF soup. It was later discovered they gave her the wrong soup and there was a scare that she was gluten’d. She is not expecting any typical symptoms yet as this happened today.

The food overall and by and large was subpar (both menus). This was certainly a frustrating point for us expecting fresh ingredients and food options from the Mediterranean region. There were only a couple of dishes that we would say were good. Furthermore, the only coffee they had available was instant coffee. This was even a conversation point with other guests who asked us our thoughts. 

Oriental restaurant

The signs stated it was going to be renovated to a different type of restaurant at the end of the year. We were late to a dinner, and decided to check out this restaurant. The glaring initial indicator is we were the only ones in the restaurant. We love Asian cuisines and wanted to try it out. We are familiar what to avoid due to gluten such as soy sauces, eel glazes, etc. When we asked the staff, they were unaware and uncertain and it created a ton of confusion. One of the cooks came out and stated a few things have gluten that normally do not (sushi rice for instance). We reached a point of unease with the restaurant and just left to go to the main restaurant.

Amenities and Entertainment 

We attended a few shows and we were pleased by 2 of the 3. The “live from…” and movie musicals shows were quite good and would recommend them. The Lady Gaga show on the other hand… perhaps find something else to do.

We spent quite a bit of time in the card room . There isn’t much of a selection other than traditional playing cards and a couple of 500 piece puzzles. Other ships have had dominos, checkers, chess, etc. 

The pool area was an appropriate size for the ship, but the outdoor pool itself didn’t have enough space and often felt way overcrowded.

Outdoor seating

During the day it was very hard if not impossible to find anywhere to sit around the pool areas. 

But most upsetting of all was that the crew put away all of the outdoor folding chairs and closed the pools/hot tubs by 8:30pm every night. This is very early during the summer months when you may enjoy an evening seat on the cooling deck. Or a hot-tub soak after a busy day of excursions. This was very disappointing each night and compared to some of the other ships we have been on.

We had a total of 6 spa treatments ranging from Deep Tissue massage, Bali massage, facials, hair treatments, and manicure. The spa staff was exceedingly polite and would recommend their treatments again! They had a sale pop up on the 5th day that we wished we had been offered at the start of the trip. Definitely suggest waiting g till you’re on board to pay and book spa treatments as they run deals daily. After each treatment, they tried to sell their brand of products. This is pretty usual compared to the other ships.

Conclusion

Overall, we would consider this to be a below average experience for cruise riding. There were many conversations with other cruise passengers and even staff from 3 different sections (not naming to protect identities) that they couldn’t wait to have their contract end or get a contract with another cruise line. It seems that this review is in line with other cruises and even some staff.

We spent a good amount of money to travel to Italy and enjoy this vacation. We walk away happy that we got to spend some quality time, but we felt our money could have been better spent elsewhere. MSC leaves a “budget friendly” taste in our mouth and would rank this option ahead of carnival but nowhere near a luxury or premium cruise line brand. If you just want a wallet-friendly way to hop Mediterranean ports and can overlook some rough edges, MSC could work.

Hope this helps and safe journeys wherever you may go!",1,1751809868.0,MSCCruises,0,1.0,False

I met my best friend in 8th grade. We're in our mid 30s now. Our friendship over the years had been carried equally we both were always there for one another. My friend is a mom as am I, but she had more kids. I have 2, she now has 5. She has a busy life beacuse of them I know this, which is why our friendship went from going on friend dates and coffee nights to her never coming to my house and instead me only going to hers with always Starbucks in hand. Our conversations for the last 2 yrs I could barley get a word in edgewise with her.  Literally she would interrupt me taking a deep breath. It felt like some sort of wall was forming.The last conversation we had, she brought up something very negative when I was in a really good mood and I asked her if we could change the subject, she got alittle upset it seemed like. That was the last time we spoke, 1 yr ago. She hasnt responded to my texts or phone calls. Her family says everything is ok and she hasn't mentioned to them why. She has ghosted me. Should I go knock on her door? Like you see ""Go check on your friends"" if shes depressed and not telling me? Ive asked her and put myself way out there. I just dont feel like i should have to force her into making contact. Idk. Any advice is appreciated. The not having closure is really hurting me.",1,1751809728.0,AITAH,6,0.6,False

Sweet and fruity without being too funky. This works well as filter and as espresso. It's not as boozy as the regular Ombligon but it still has some of its characteristics. It tastes like a good quality single origin chocolate with fruity notes. I know loads of you see chocolate and run away but this one genuinely tastes like good chocolate.

1lt1no0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1lt1no0/people_upset_over_video_games_being_priced_at_80/,People upset over video games being priced at $80 are incredibly out of touch and are the biggest reasons for the horrific pay and insane workload game developers suffer,"Whenever the discussion of video game pricing is brought up, people treat it like it's a war crime if any game developer deviates from the $60 price point everyone is accustomed to. There was outrage and threats of boycotts when Nintendo announced games on the Switch 2 could be priced at $80.

But in reality, games have been priced at $60 for almost 20 years now and are way, WAY overdue for a price increase.

$60 in 2006 would be at minimum $90 in todays money and yet gamers think they should be getting better quality games while paying comparatively less money for the games, there's a complete disconnect.

And the effects of this price point being held absolutely hamper the gaming industry. The people working on the games are paid less and have insane workloads and crunch to try and force out games despite having lower staff numbers than they otherwise would if games were properly priced.

Additionally, all of the things gamers love to cry about such as microtransactions and battle passes have risen to prominence partially due to greed, but also because game developers need a way to make extra money given their cost bases have grown exponentially while the price of games has been stuck at $60 forever.

It is incredibly ironic that the people most upset about games moving up from $60 are the same ones who would also be outraged at game developers being laid off or worked too hard, or crying over a game implementing a battle pass.

The value you get from good games is obscene. Lets say you put 100 hours into a $60 game, you've basically paid $0.60 per hour of entertainment. When you consider people pay $15 for a movie ticket that gets them 2 hours of entertainment or $5 for a coffee, the value proposition is wild.

If you are an adult and a price increase of $20 makes or breaks your ability to purchase a game, you likely have bigger issues you need to confront before devoting hours into gaming.

By keeping games priced at $60 for the last 20 years we have managed to:

* Artificially deflate game developer salaries
* Forced game developers into working unreasonable hours to meet near impossible deadlines
* Encouraged dogshit practices like microtransactions and battle passes
* Made game developers less able to take risks on games because the number of copies they need to sell to be successfully is way higher when you can only sell for $60
* Helped contribute to mass layoffs in the gaming industry as companies grapple with escalating cost bases and no relief in the form of rising prices

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

And no, I don't work for a game developer or hold stock in a games development company. I'm a casual gamer (sports games primarily).",3,1751809634.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,8,0.6,False

I have some fixed days I need to be in Boston. The idea is to visit Washington DC first, head to Boston at some point and then fly back from NYC.

  
Current schedule:

|Date|Location|
|:-|:-|
|Oct 19 – Oct 22 (3 full days)|Washington DC|
|Oct 23 – Oct 26 (3 full days)|Boston|
|Oct 27 – Oct 31 (no time to myself)|Boston and NYC (incl transfer)|
|Oct 31 – Nov 3|NYC|

I will not be able to use the time from Oct 27 - 31 for sightseeing. Because of that I need to balance Washington DC and Boston from Oct 19 to 26.



My biggest questions:

* What city would you prioritize? Currently I have 3 full days in both of them, any other recommendations?
* How would you get from Washington to Boston? Some say the train ride is beautiful, others say it's not that great and to just fly...? 

  
What I like to do: (preferably) walk, find a local coffee shop to sit and soak in the city. Learn a bit about the history without spending days in museums. I also like the outdoors, though of course I know this trip will not be a Rocky Mountain adventure.  
Also: I've been to the US quite a few times (mostly South and Mid West) so I usually have an easy time getting around, orientation etc.

In the breville the water output was a down spout you just put the cup underneath and got a clean stream.

I’ve hauled freight up and down the northern border for the better part of twelve years. It’s quiet work, mostly. A lot of long nights, empty highways, and hours to think.

Before this, I was in logistics for the Army. Got deployed twice. Desert heat, endless paperwork, a thousand moving parts to make sure convoys got from point A to point B without turning into headlines. After I mustered out, this felt like the natural fit. Hauling timber instead of tanks. Paper bills instead of orders. Still moving things. Still useful.

I typically drove at night. Less traffic, fewer distractions. My route from Thunder Bay to Duluth had become second nature, winding through forested backroads and long stretches of blacktop so straight they felt like they’d split the earth in two. I’d stop for gas, keep the CB on low, sip strong coffee, and let the world slip by.

Most nights were uneventful. That’s what I liked about it. Predictable. Solitary. I’ve always been a skeptic by nature. Grew up practical. Never put much stock in ghost stories or campfire nonsense.

Then came the job last October.

I crossed the border late, around 11:30 PM. It was drizzling, and the customs guy looked at me longer than normal. Young kid. Had to ask twice for my paperwork like his head was somewhere else.

“Got a lot of lumber in there,” he said, peering past me into the darkness.

“Yeah,” I replied. “Same shipment type as last week.”

He nodded, but didn’t move. “You hear anything back there, you don’t stop. You understand?”

I blinked. “What?”

He shook his head, like shaking off a thought. “Drive safe, sir.”

I chalked it up to a bad night. Maybe he’d seen some weird moose on the road or had a fight with his girlfriend. I drove off, tires humming on wet pavement.

A couple hours into Minnesota, the road dipped into a thick stretch of forest. Pines rising like walls on both sides. The heater in my cab was on full blast, but I felt cold. Not a breeze-through-the-window kind of cold, more like the kind that creeps inside your bones.

That’s when I heard the whispering.

It was faint. Like someone mumbling just beneath the sound of the engine. I turned off the radio. Nothing. But the whispering didn’t stop.

I cracked the window, thinking maybe it was wind. Trees brushing against each other. Nothing out there but darkness.

I shook my head. Just tired. I’d been pushing too hard. The road was hypnotic, and fatigue could play tricks.

Then the CB crackled.

Not static. Not a voice either. Something… in between. Like someone trying to talk through a throat full of gravel. Words half-formed and warped, broken and backward. I turned the volume down, then off.

Still, the whispers continued.

In my rearview mirror, something moved.

Just for a second. A flicker. A silhouette darting past the trailer. But when I turned to look directly, nothing. Just the steady rhythm of my own headlights and the long black ribbon of the road.

I pulled into a rest stop sometime past 2:00 AM. Place was deserted. One broken vending machine buzzing near the bathroom and a flickering overhead light that made the shadows twitch. I stepped out, the cold slapping me awake.

The trailer was quiet. I circled it slowly, boots crunching over gravel.

That’s when I saw the marks.

Claw-like gouges along one side of the lumber stack. Four deep scratches on a plank near the top, too high for any animal I know. The wood splintered outward, like something had been trying to get out. Or in.

I didn’t like the way my skin prickled. I chalked it up to vandalism. Maybe someone screwed with the load in Canada and I hadn’t noticed. Maybe it was just old damage from a forklift.

I climbed back into the cab, started her up, and glanced once more into the rear window.

That’s when I saw it.

A pale hand, impossibly long, thin, almost skeletal, slithered back between the gaps in the lumber. Just for a split second. A blink. The hand pulled back and vanished into the darkness.

I slammed the brakes. Jumped out with my flashlight. But when I searched the trailer, there was nothing. No movement. No signs. Just cold air and the faint smell of wet wood.

I told myself it was a hallucination. Lack of sleep. Brain hiccups.

But my hands didn’t stop shaking.

I considered stopping in the next town, but dispatch was on my ass about delivery times. Said I was already behind. No room in the schedule for ghost stories.

So I kept driving.

The road narrowed, coiling like a snake through the hills. No streetlights. No signs. The forest leaned close on both sides like it was listening.

Then, the truck jerked hard to the right.

The engine sputtered. Dashboard lights blinked like a dying Christmas tree. I swore and yanked the wheel, guiding the rig onto the shoulder as the whole thing rumbled to a stop. Silence swallowed me.

I tried the ignition. Nothing. Dead.

I popped the hood, climbed out. The engine looked fine. No leaks, no smoke. But something smelled… wrong. Like old rot. Like something wet and alive had crawled into the machinery.

Behind me, the trailer groaned.

I turned.

The tarp covering the lumber was moving. Not from wind. It rippled in rhythmic waves, like something underneath was breathing.

Then it *tore*.

Figures pulled themselves free from the lumber pile. Twisted things, all limbs and splinters, like dead trees warped into the shape of men. Their skin was bark and sinew, mottled with knots. Eyes glowed faint green, like swamp lights. Their mouths didn’t open, but I heard them, deep inside my skull, whispering.

I ran.

I scrambled into the cab, slammed the door, locked it, shaking so hard I dropped my wrench.

The creatures swarmed the truck.

One climbed the hood, its hand cracking the windshield with a single strike. Another dragged claws along the side door, leaving deep gouges in the metal.

I reached under the passenger seat. There, inside the old metal box I never thought I’d need, was my emergency satellite phone.

I called for help. My voice was hoarse, barely coherent. I gave my location, screamed that I was under attack. The dispatcher’s voice crackled, then the line went dead.

A creature shattered the passenger window.

I swung the wrench.

The blow connected. It screamed, a sound that pierced straight through the marrow. The others paused, pulled back. I didn’t wait. I kicked open the door and ran.

Behind me, they tore into the truck. I heard metal scream, glass pop. Then the whole cab groaned and flipped onto its side with a sickening crunch.

I hit the ditch hard. Everything spun. I don’t remember much after that.

When the highway patrol found me hours later, I was walking barefoot down the center of the road. Covered in blood and mud. I couldn’t say my name. Couldn’t say anything except, “The things… in the wood.”

They said it was a freak accident. Said my truck died and the load shifted, caused the crash. Said I must’ve hit my head, hallucinated the rest.

But I saw the lumber. Saw how it twisted. How some planks had warped into almost-human shapes. Limbs. Faces. Eyes frozen mid-scream.

The investigating officer didn’t say anything. But he didn’t look right either. Like he’d seen it too.

They called it trauma. Told me to rest. Said I’d probably never drive again.

And they were right.

I never went back on the road.

But I still hear the whispers.

Sometimes, when the wind moves through the trees outside my window, I swear I can still see those eyes, glowing faint in the dark.

Waiting.

1lt1e4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lt1e4i/why_review_the_keurig_kduo_gen_2_coffee_maker_for/,Why Review the Keurig K-Duo Gen 2 Coffee Maker for Your Home?,"Testing the Keurig 5000378536 K-Duo Hot & Iced Single Serve & Carafe Coffee Maker has been a game-changer in my morning routine. This versatile brewer doesn't just look good on my countertop; it functions beautifully, blending both single-serve convenience with the capability to brew full carafes. Whether it’s a solo morning boost with a K-Cup or coffee grounds for a weekend brunch crowd, this machine seems geared to handle it all. My routine has never felt this flexible—or caffeinated.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design of this coffee maker caught my attention instantly. At 12.9""D x 11.1""W x 12.7""H, it fits snugly in a corner of my kitchen without hogging counter space. The sleek black finish gives it a modern, stylish appearance that compliments my appliances. Built with a single removable water reservoir that serves both the single-serve and carafe sections, it’s not just practical—it’s smart. I’ve had lesser machines and trust me, the shared tank is a time-saver. Minimal refills and easy access are wins in my book.

**Performance and Versatility**  
The brewing options are where this machine truly shines. The MultiStream Technology is a noticeable upgrade; it extracts the flavor and aroma evenly, whether I’m brewing coffee hot or enjoying their Brew Over Ice feature for iced drinks. My personal favorite is the Strong Brew function for a more robust kick, while my mom swears by the Extra Hot feature for a piping-hot cup. Add the programmable Auto Brew carafe, which I tested by setting it the night before hosting brunch, and you’ve got a coffee maker that feels like a personal barista.

[Find the best price for Keurig 5000378536 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d8lxrhq8/)  

**Good Points**  
- Compact design with dual functionality (single-serve and carafe brewing).  
- Advanced MultiStream Technology for fully saturated coffee grounds.  
- Multiple brew sizes with both hot and cold options.  
- Strong Brew and Extra Hot features cater to varied preferences.  

**Usability and Control**  
The intuitive front-facing control panel is a nice touch. I’ve owned coffee makers with cryptic interfaces, and this one is refreshingly straightforward. From selecting my desired cup size (6, 8, 10, or 12oz) to pouring 6, 8, 10, or 12 cups into the carafe, the interface made it easy to customize my brew. The Pause & Pour feature is something I didn’t even know I needed—brewing halts for 20 seconds, so I can sneak in a quick pour during a busy morning rush. For someone who multitasks as much as me, this function is a lifesaver.

**Drawbacks**  
- The glass carafe, while designed to minimize dripping, could benefit from a more robust design as it feels a tad fragile.  
- Although compact, the machine could be challenging in tighter spaces due to its height.  
- Cleaning the removable parts isn’t tough, but I noticed smaller nooks require an extra scrub.  

**Programming and Advanced Features**  
Being able to set my brew time up to 24 hours in advance is a game-changer for busy mornings. I loved how I could program the machine the night before; waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee hits differently. Additionally, the one 72oz reservoir makes the entire brewing process incredibly seamless, especially if you drink as much coffee as I do. No excessive refills, and refitting the tank after washing was a breeze.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, a competitor that also offers dual brewing, the Keurig machine felt sleeker and more user-friendly. Hamilton Beach's manual settings require more effort, whereas the Keurig’s front-facing controls are much more straightforward. The Ninja DualBrew Pro might have slightly more customization options, but it sacrifices some ease of use when transitioning between modes. If convenience and a modern design matter to you, the Keurig holds its ground impressively well in this crowded market.

**Value for Money**  
This coffee maker punches well above its weight in value. While I’ve seen competitors offering similar features, they often overshot my budget. The affordability of this brewer without compromising functions like strong coffee and iced brewing feels like a solid win. I’m always looking to blend quality with reasonable pricing, and this machine strikes a commendable balance. It feels like a smart investment into my day-to-day caffeine adventures.

1lt18mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalLifeHacks/comments/1lt18mg/can_lactose_intolerance_cause_bloating_that_was/,Can lactose intolerance cause bloating? That was my main symptom,"When people talk about **lactose intolerance**, they often focus on dramatic symptoms like stomach cramps or rushing to the bathroom. But for me, it wasn’t like that. It was the constant **bloating** that slowly wore me down, and I had no idea dairy was the cause.

If you’re dealing with that tight, uncomfortable belly feeling after meals and you’re not sure why, this might sound familiar.

**Yes, lactose intolerance can definitely cause bloating**

Here’s what I didn’t know: when your body can’t break down **lactose** (the sugar in dairy), it just sits in your gut. Undigested. Then it starts to ferment, which produces **gas**. That gas builds up and causes bloating, pressure, and that awkward “I look five months pregnant” feeling, even if you barely ate.

I’d feel it after cereal, mac and cheese, or even just cream in my coffee. But I never linked it to dairy because the reaction wasn’t immediate or extreme. Just slow, steady discomfort, every single day.

**I cut dairy for a while - and the bloating vanished**

That’s when I realized something was up. No dairy? No bloat. I tested it again by having some yogurt. Bloat was back. It was a clear pattern.

But let’s be honest, cutting dairy completely is hard. It’s in everything. I didn’t want to live without pizza or lattes forever, so I started trying enzyme supplements to help break down the lactose.

Most of the ones I tried at first were weak. I still felt bloated after eating, even when I took two or three pills.

Then I found **DairyPill**.

**Why DairyPill made a difference**

What stood out immediately is that each **DairyPill** has 18,000 FCC units of lactase enzyme - that’s up to **6X stronger** than the average pill at the drugstore.

I take **just one** before my first bite of anything with dairy, and I don’t bloat. I can eat ice cream, creamy pasta, and even grilled cheese without feeling tight or sluggish afterward.

It was the first time I could enjoy dairy without regret, and without carrying around stretchy pants.

Here’s the link I used to get mine:  
[**Official DairyPill Site**](https://getdairypill.com/offer-01/?lpid=1059&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1059&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1059&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1059&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

[**DairyPill Real-User Breakdown**](https://getdairypill.com/listicle/?lpid=2614&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1059&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1059&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2614&oid=1059&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

**How I use it**

I keep the **Key Pod** it comes with on my keychain so I always have some with me. Whether I’m out for pizza or grabbing dessert, I don’t have to worry about bloating anymore. One pill. That’s it.

**If bloating is your main issue, dairy might be the hidden culprit**

It took me a long time to figure that out. My reaction wasn’t “bad enough” to seem like a food intolerance, but it *was* affecting my comfort, my energy, and honestly, my confidence.

Now I can enjoy dairy again without feeling like I have to change into sweatpants after every meal.

If bloating is something you’re fighting often, and nothing else seems to explain it, try looking at your dairy intake. And if cutting it isn’t realistic, **DairyPill** gave me an option that worked, without giving up the foods I love.

Anyone else here deal with bloating as your main symptom? Curious to hear how others figured it out.",1,1751808451.0,NaturalLifeHacks,0,1.0,False

When we get married it’s customary to invite family over to your home. I cannot be expected to ask everyone to take their shoes off but she insists that this rule must be followed.

For context when we have friends over I always ask for them to take their shoes off out of respect for her wishes, but in this one instance it’s difficult for me to ask that of my aunts or uncles. We’re also both the children of immigrants (born and raised in the USA) and while we both love the cultures we come from we most definitely are Americanized. The real reason for taking shoes off is cleanliness not so much cultural norms but she uses it as a reason to support her argument. AITAH for asking to make this one exception?

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the job market has changed but our attitudes haven’t.

**1) Degrees ≠ Jobs Anymore**

Many grads are stuck in limbo….waiting for a public sector post or underpaid in the private sector. And the ‘office job or nothing’ mindset only makes it worse.

**2) Meanwhile, Skilled Trades Are Booming**

Skilled workers like *electricians, bakers, mechanics, plumbers and coffee brewers* are thriving….here and regionally. They’re multi-skilled…technical work, people skills, managing time and often running their own business.

There are freelance technicians and cafe owners pulling in $4–5k/month, quietly and sustainably.

They’re not ‘just baristas’ or ‘tukang servis aircond’….They’re entrepreneurs, specialists and some earn more than mid-tier civil servants.

**3) The Problem? Social Perception**

Our culture still sees skilled work as something you do if you ‘fail academically’….That’s wrong! and dangerous. Because while we chase status, we’re importing skills we should be training locally.

You know what’s actually ‘low value’? Four years in university, thousands in costs (if you’re paying), and no job to show for it….when someone else spent 6 months learning how to fix aircons and now runs their own business.

**4) What Needs to Change**

- Parents and schools need to stop shaming vocational paths.
- Youth should explore skill-based careers that actually pay.
- Brunei needs to rebrand TVET …..not as a backup, but as a respected, viable choice.
- Respect all work. Because the people who build, repair, and create are the ones who actually keep society running.

It’s time we stop chasing job titles and start chasing value. If you’re a good *baker, mechanic, barista, or plumber* ….you don’t need anyone’s approval. Your skill is your status.

Recently, I've been obsessed with cold brew coffee concentrate. It's perfect for those hot summer days when you need a refreshing caffeine kick. Let me share my process for making this delicious drink.

First, you'll need coarsely ground coffee beans. The grind size is crucial - too fine, and you'll end up with a bitter, over-extracted brew. I usually use a 1:4 ratio of coffee to water, but you can adjust this to your taste.

Next, combine the coffee grounds and cold water in a large container. Stir gently to make sure all the grounds are wet. Cover the container and let it sit at room temperature for 12-24 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger your concentrate will be.

After steeping, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth or a paper filter. This removes all the grounds, leaving you with a smooth, rich concentrate.

Store your cold brew concentrate in the fridge. It'll keep for up to two weeks, but in my house, it never lasts that long!

When you're ready to drink, dilute the concentrate with water or milk to your preferred strength. I like mine with a 1:1 ratio of concentrate to water, poured over ice. It's incredibly smooth and less acidic than regular iced coffee.

If you're serious about your cold brew, investing in a good iced coffee maker can make the process even easier. I've found some great options at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. These specialized brewers take the guesswork out of ratios and filtering, giving you perfect cold brew every time.

One thing I love about cold brew concentrate is its versatility. You can use it in cocktails, bake with it, or even make coffee popsicles. The possibilities are endless!

For those busy mornings when I don't have time to make a fresh batch, having a reliable iced coffee maker is a game-changer. Check out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers - you might find your new favorite kitchen gadget.

Making cold brew coffee concentrate at home is a simple process that yields delicious results. With a little patience and the right equipment, you'll be enjoying smooth, refreshing cold brew in no time. Happy brewing!",1,1751807710.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Every morning feels like a mini heartbreak all over again.

We weren’t perfect. We had our issues, communication, timing, maybe just growing in different directions. But I loved them deeply, and I really believed we’d figure it out together. They were my person, or at least I thought they were.

Now it’s just,  silence. And the worst part? They seem fine. Meanwhile, I’m doing everything I can just to make it through the day without crying in public.

I’m not looking for pity. I just needed to say this somewhere. To people who get it. People who know what it’s like to lose not just a partner, but the future you imagined with them.

If you’ve been here, at this stage where it feels like you’re just holding yourself together with coffee and podcasts and late-night walks,  how did you start to feel like *you* again?

1lt0us1,https://i.redd.it/cvgiqmrq69bf1.jpeg,"Cat vomiting and refusing wet food, vets perplexed","Hi everyone, I have a 1year 8month old male (neutered) rescue kitty who has the vets at a loss as to what’s wrong with him.

He’s been picky about his wet food recently, not finishing and scratching around his bowl etc., but perfectly happy to eat dry food.

On Friday morning he vomited, then again Saturday afternoon, and again Sunday around 4am. It’s always undigested food, no coffee grain texture or blood.

We’ve been to the vet and from what they can tell there’s no obstruction or foreign body, and his liver, stomach and bladder feel fine. They gave him an anti-vomiting injection, told me to monitor and offer small amounts of a sensitive cat food, and return to the vet if he vomits again.

He’s refusing all wet food (even tuna water and chicken broth) but happy to eat his dry food, and seems hungry for more.

The vet suggested he may have eaten something outside (e.g. we have horsetail growing in the garden which I’ve been trying to get rid of and is toxic) but this doesn’t explain him being super picky about his wet food over the last month.

Each day I usually feed: 
-2x Untamed chicken in gravy 
-20g Hills Science Plan adult chicken biscuits
 
Untamed claims to be hypoallergenic, so even though the vet suggested potential allergies I’m not sure this fits.

His brother is now also refusing to eat but there’s nothing wrong with him.

We had a similar situation about a year ago - vomiting, wet food refusal etc., which resolved after a couple of days of anti-emetics and gabapentin. Bloods came back normal and no foreign bodies detected. Vet suggested a fish allergy so we have been feeding exclusively chicken.

I’m going crazy here wondering if there is something chronic that is being missed. Is it worth paying for an ultrasound even if the vomiting stops? Any advice in the meantime?

Kitty pictured for your viewing pleasure (his name is Sergio). Thanks!

1lt0sq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1lt0sq0/truma_dump_and_seeking_advice/,Truma dump and seeking advice,"When I was a child, my life felt like a nightmare I couldn’t escape. My father was an alcoholic and abusive, so I was sent to a school hostel in grade 2 to get away from him. The hostel should have been a refuge, but it became another battlefield. I was small and quiet, so the older boys bullied me constantly. Then one day, when I was about seven (grade 2) and a group of seniors in grade 8 cornered me in a deserted classroom. They grabbed me and slit the back of my neck. I remember the cold rush of fear as blood poured out – my neck was hanging off. Terrified and stunned, I somehow ran to the school nurse, clutching my mangled neck. The nurse rushed me to the hospital, and I survived emergency surgery that day. No one ever found out who did it – I suspect the attackers (or someone helping them) bribed the school. I never told anyone what happened, not even my family, out of fear.

After I healed, we changed schools. I thought a new place might mean peace, but the bullying followed me. I’d make up excuses and skip school just to avoid it. My skin disease improved at that next school, but the taunting never stopped. At home, we weren’t actually wealthy like people assumed. My father did receive a pension of about 400,000 rupees (4 lakh) every two months, but he was completely financially illiterate. He lost most of it very quickly, partly because he was naive and partly because he took out loans for relatives who never paid him back. My mother and three sisters couldn’t help manage it either. Soon, all our money was gone and the loans piled up. By the time I was in grade 6, the pension would arrive and be gone in just two weeks – most of it drained by debt payments, bills, and Dad’s drinking.

I spent a lot of my afternoons hiding in my sister’s clothing shop instead of going home. My eldest sister had a clothing store, and I felt safer there. Home was a terrifying place – I didn’t know what Dad might do when he was drunk. Meanwhile, my parents were on the verge of divorce. My mother had already left because of my father’s abuse, and she moved out of our house. During lockdown (when I was in grade 6), my middle sister and I were living together, and my youngest sister stayed in the shop’s warehouse. My eldest sister, who had moved to the USA, helped arrange for our father to go to rehab. For a while, it seemed like things might change: Dad went to rehab and we even moved to a new apartment for a fresh start.

But it only got worse. Dad seemed fine when he first left rehab, but by mid-COVID he relapsed completely. We still had 1.6 million rupees saved, but within three months he drank it all away. He spent our savings on alcohol, gambling, and reckless projects. He even started building a second story on our house for no clear reason, and then left it unfinished. He brought strange, drunk friends home at all hours. We ended up taking out more loans just to cover daily expenses. It felt like a repeat of the past: by grade 8, despite a new house and new school, Dad’s alcoholism haunted every part of our lives again.

I tried to keep living my life. In grade 8, I went back to school and started trying to socialize more. I joined the gym and learned to talk to people through online games. I grew tall and strong, and for the first time I had some friends who weren’t bullies. But one day a boy who had bullied me before pulled me into an empty classroom and beat me up badly. I just cowered and let it happen. Nothing I did could make them stop coming after me.

In grade 9 I went on an overnight school trip to Pokhara with my classmates. I was scared because the older kids were drunk on the bus ride. They forced me into a room with them. They poured an entire jar of instant coffee powder into my drink and made me gulp it down so I couldn’t sleep. They mocked me all night, and told me things like “kill yourself” and “cut your arm.” I cried myself to sleep that night. When we got home, I started wearing long sleeves every day to hide bruises and self-harm scars. I just retreated into myself completely.

At home, Dad managed to stay out of rehab for a while, and for a moment it looked like we might have a normal life. One day I caught him smoking, and he fell to his knees, begging me for forgiveness and promising to never drink again. I wanted to believe him. I finished my school leaving exams (SEE) with an A grade after struggling earlier. I even excelled in swimming – I’m a national-level swimmer – and I started feeling a bit better about myself. We paid off some loans with the pension and thought maybe things were turning around.

Then Dad got scammed. He invested a lot of money in a fraudulent business deal. The people who took the investment vanished, and even the family lawyer was involved. One day Dad was working far away to try to recover money; he got hurt while building on that big project. I was sixteen by then and we had a scooter, so I and my sister followed his bus to bring him back home 100 km through flooded roads. He was completely drunk at 6 AM, and when he came home injured he nearly went crazy with rage if we woke him. The next day I had an exam for my A-levels (11th grade) and I couldn’t sleep at all from worry. We had to send him to rehab a third time right after that, hoping to save him.

That rehab stint was the worst. Dad was taking too many pills and still drinking on top of them. He smoked, ate junk, and when he got drunk he verbally and physically abused us – often in front of my younger sisters and me. We had to escape our own home at times. Finally, in grade 11, I snapped. I took Dad to rehab myself (dropping him off at the gate in an ambulance, actually) and said, “I’m done, I can’t handle this anymore.” As soon as he left, I crashed. I stopped eating and only used my phone, lying in bed 23 hours a day. I gained a lot of weight and sank deep into depression.

In all this chaos, life took one final tragic turn: after Dad left rehab for the last time, we were hopeful he was getting better. He even apologized to me and helped me focus on my swimming. But after the 45-day mourning period (puja) passed, Dad’s health collapsed. He died in my arms one night at home. I watched my mother and sisters cry; I held my mother and my other sisters tightly as we realized our world had ended. I cremated him myself. In those last moments, my dad smiled at me, and I held his hand and massaged his feet like I never had a chance to in life. I can’t explain it – it was like he finally trusted me and was at peace. It was the hardest, most surreal moment of my life.

When the flames covered him, I felt incredible guilt. I blamed myself for years – “Did I send him to rehab too many times? Did I fail him?” But he was the one who suffered from alcohol and poor health; he would have died eventually, I think. Still, I kept those feelings inside. After it was over, a strange thing happened: my suicidal thoughts vanished for a while. Maybe because I had to be strong for my family, or because I felt I had to live on for my dad’s sake. But now, more than a year later, those dark thoughts are creeping back.

Now I’m 17, finishing my last year of A-levels, and everything is still a mess. Our family has huge financial problems: we have five big loans that we struggle to pay, and four young women (my mom and 3 sisters) depending on a pension. That pension is only 400,000 rupees every two months, and 80% of it goes straight to loan payments. By the middle of each month, we have nothing left – we literally run out of money. We don’t have jobs or income besides that pension; none of us has worked a day except my eldest sister who ran the clothing business (and even that is barely breaking even because of COVID). My plan was to renovate the house Dad started (finish that second floor) and rent it out for passive income. Then sell off the pieces of land and small houses we own scattered around, use that as a down payment on a proper new family home, and take a new mortgage on it while paying it off with the rent from the old house. But right now it feels impossible.

My younger sister (only a couple years older than me) has taken on a lot: she manages our finances and handles the daily stuff, but she’s overwhelmed. My middle sister is religious and always “busy with work” that she never explains to us, and my mother stays out of things too. My eldest sister got married and moved to the USA, and whenever she comes she starts arguments that just set us back emotionally. She even told our dad off the last time we visited him in rehab, and when he died, she didn’t come back – she only sent her husband. I held my breath watching everyone else weep; I didn’t even want to burden her more than she already is.

I feel completely alone in making these plans. I want to force things to change: to get back that 10 million rupees someone still owes my dad, to restore any inheritance that was ours, to finish the house and finally have an income so we can break free of these loans. But none of the plans move forward. I don’t know how or where to start. My grandfather (Dad’s father) died leaving land and money, but since he had two wives and many children, nobody knows what was left or who is supposed to get what. One of my dad’s brothers cheated him out of our house back then. My relatives say I should have inherited a lot, but I don’t even know what the law says or what I’m entitled to. The lawyer who handled my father’s affairs turned out to be a crook too – he took all our original documents and ran off. We have no proof of anything.

I’m writing all of this raw, painful truth because I have to find some way out. I feel like if I don’t solve this, I can’t ever be happy – maybe I can’t even live. I know it sounds desperate, but I am desperate. I want this nightmare to end. I need advice. How do I fix our house and use it for rent? How can I combine those five loans into one with lower interest? How do I sell our assets smartly and buy a new house? Most of all, how do I find out and claim the inheritance that’s rightfully mine? I need a lawyer, but I don’t even know where to look. And I can’t afford one on my own.

I’m pouring out my heart here hoping someone can help. I want this to sound real so people understand how badly I need guidance. It’s like every day I’m suffocating from all these problems, and if nothing changes, I don’t know if I’ll survive it all.

I am terrified of doing something I can’t undo. Please, if you have any advice – financial planning, legal steps, emotional support – I will hang onto every word. I just need a path forward before I lose the will to keep fighting",6,1751807217.0,NepalSocial,7,1.0,False

• them working in the same company and getting stuck after a test run gone wrong

• being recruited (squid game style) at random, to test out a new video game.

But after episode 5, I now officially love the idea that they’re all just normal people with no direct relation to C&A at all and just got dragged into the game at chance after. With their only thing in common is finding the building abandoned and putting on the headset.

That would also explain why there are only six people at present time where the show is taking place. The older the building got, the less likely it was for someone to stumble upon the game. (But not impossible.) —Yes, abstraction exists. But for thousands those things to be in the cellar, it had to be a very continuous incident. Which I doubt. Unless mentally unstable from the start, no person can just lose their shit that quickly (I think. And I hope…)

So I definitely believe it took years until they all lost it—saved for Kinger and probably a few other members. And everyone else with him is the newest “batch” of victims for another round of uncounted years.

.

.

.

So the title only has three characters because it was technically hinted how Zooble, Pomni, and Ragatha wound up in the C&A building.

**Pomni and Zooble:** Exploring abandoned buildings; probably found the headset while snooping around.

**Ragatha:** Worked real estate; must’ve been trying to sell the building, but took a peak at some rooms beforehand.

While it wasn’t explicitly stated, Pomni kinda answered how she ended up in the circus by telling her little thrill-seeking hobby.

The other three (Kinger, Gangle, and Jax) never shared anything other than a small backstory. (Jax didn’t share anything at all)…

 …

So while it’s still unconfirmed, let’s just share some theories and headcanons with no proof, as we wait.

**Gangle:** I assume she was dared by her coworkers or college mates that still kept in touch after she dropped out, to join in on a ghost hunting adventure as an after-work activity.

She was peer pressured into doing spooky stuff like chanting and drawing on the wall. And unluckily got dared to put on a weird headset.

**Jax:** I kinda made a whole post of that already; just a rebelling teen who ran away and became a hobo just to prove a point.

**Kinger:** As cliche as it sounds, I like to think he and his wife met at a bakery or coffee shop that was teared down and replaced with the C&A building the day after he proposed.

He and his wife come back to it years later, after the company flunked and thought it would be silly and youthful to explore the area and found a couple of headsets that they found interesting. Because… old people love trying to see what the appeal is for younger kids and these new devices.",2,1751807162.0,theamazingdigitalciru,0,1.0,False

I held my breath watching everyone else weep; I didn’t even want to burden her more than she already is.

I feel completely alone in making these plans. I want to force things to change: to get back that 10 million rupees someone still owes my dad, to restore any inheritance that was ours, to finish the house and finally have an income so we can break free of these loans. But none of the plans move forward. I don’t know how or where to start. My grandfather (Dad’s father) died leaving land and money, but since he had two wives and many children, nobody knows what was left or who is supposed to get what. One of my dad’s brothers cheated him out of our house back then. My relatives say I should have inherited a lot, but I don’t even know what the law says or what I’m entitled to. The lawyer who handled my father’s affairs turned out to be a crook too – he took all our original documents and ran off. We have no proof of anything.

I’m writing all of this raw, painful truth because I have to find some way out. I feel like if I don’t solve this, I can’t ever be happy – maybe I can’t even live. I know it sounds desperate, but I am desperate. I want this nightmare to end. I need advice. How do I fix our house and use it for rent? How can I combine those five loans into one with lower interest? How do I sell our assets smartly and buy a new house? Most of all, how do I find out and claim the inheritance that’s rightfully mine? I need a lawyer, but I don’t even know where to look. And I can’t afford one on my own.

I’m pouring out my heart here hoping someone can help. I want this to sound real so people understand how badly I need guidance. It’s like every day I’m suffocating from all these problems, and if nothing changes, I don’t know if I’ll survive it all.

I am terrified of doing something I can’t undo. Please, if you have any advice – financial planning, legal steps, emotional support – I will hang onto every word. I just need a path forward before I lose the will to keep fighting",2,1751806979.0,NepalSocial,2,1.0,False

1lt0nun,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1lt0nun/money_advice_partner_with_adhd/,Money advice - partner with ADHD,"Looking for some advice about money in an ADHD/autism relationship. Myself and my partner have been together for 6 years and lived together for 5 years. We split bills 50/50. He works full time, I work part time and also get PIP so we have the same income every month. 

Every month, my partner owes me money and it keeps increasing. As of right now, he owes me almost £800 which is significant. This comes from living above his means (buying coffee and lunch at work all the time, PC repayments, Steam games, etc). Every month he promises it won’t happen again, that he understands, that this has been the wake up he needs to get a handle on things. But it doesn’t change! His impulse control goes out the window and he just goes back to the same behaviours again and again.

For reference, he has an official ADHD diagnosis and I have an official autism diagnosis (undiagnosed but potential ADHD for me too). 

How do I get things to change here? He is unmedicated as he’s only just been diagnosed, so maybe meds would help. But is there anything I can do to help with his impulse/self control with spending, so I’m not lending him hundreds of pounds every month? I’m trying to save for a house and have been saving for years and years - I’m getting close to the amount for a deposit on a house for us both but he can’t contribute anything.

Hello folks,

I’m new here—and new to the espresso hobby as well! My wife recently gifted me a De’Longhi EC900M after my old coffee machine gave out.

This is my first time using a proper espresso machine, and I’ve been diving into YouTube videos and guides to learn more about the process of making great espresso.

I have a quick question for the group: I’m thinking of trying a bottomless portafilter with this machine. Can anyone recommend one that fits the EC900M specifically?

There’s a lot of information out there—reviews, videos, etc.—but the feedback seems all over the place when it comes to quality, fit, and compatibility. The Normcore 51mm seems to be a leading contender, but I’d love to hear from people who actually own the EC900M and have tried different brands.

Thanks so much—I look forward to learning from you all!

I think I have found the ideal spacing for terrain block support. Placing a grid of blocks spaced 6x8 apart only has one block of overlap per pillar, and leaves a perfect space in the center of each formation for a final set of pillars.

Building rows or columns of platforms between the pillars is enough support for construction, and they can be removed once the layer is built.

The heights are customizable, but I am going with 2,2,3,3,3,3, top. The top layer will be for Mangroves/Blueberries/Coffee, and the pillars being terrain will irrigate the entire box from that pond.

1lt0gu3,https://v.redd.it/nehldk0g39bf1,A Sagittarius and a Libra Walk Into a Café... and Venus Was Watching ... Which other zodiac you can relate to this ?,"A Sagittarius and a Libra Walk Into a Café... and Venus Was Watching 🌸

Today, I watched something that melted my heart and stirred my soul—a moment that felt like Venus herself scripted it.

A young boy, full of Sagittarian charm and innocence, sat across a radiant Libra girl, sipping cold coffee. A bit of cream lingered on her upper lip, and he didn’t laugh—he smiled. Gently, he pointed it out, and when she wiped it off, he said something that could light up anyone’s chart:

> “I just saw the prettiest girl on Earth. Don’t look now, she’s getting a lot of stares.”



Curious, she turned—and saw her reflection in the mirror behind her.

It wasn’t just a compliment. It was a moment of pure Venusian magic. ✨

This… this is what happens when Venus transits through your chart—especially when it touches your 1st or 7th house. Love isn’t always loud. Sometimes, it’s a quiet smile, a gentle truth, and a mirror that finally shows you what others see.

As a Sagittarius, I’ve always believed love should be free, playful, and deeply felt. But watching this Libra-Sag moment reminded me: love also lives in stillness, in presence, in reflection.

Have you ever experienced something like this during a Venus transit?

Drop your birth chart placements below—especially if you're a Libra or Sagittarius—and let’s talk about how love has surprised you.

[Poland]","We're moving out to our first house and our apartment will be either set up for long term rental or AirBnb

It was set up for a remote work family of 2 (so its a single bedroon + main room + home offce, with a bathroom and a place to do laundry). I have a TV in each, tons of game consoles (I work in QA so i needed to have these), plan to have a subscription in each room for all streaming services etc.

My home office has 3 pricey screens, with great cable management, so you just plug in and have everything set up to work (+ i plan to leave out some mini pcs for someone who just wants to drop in to do some work).

We also have a high model coffee machine (jura), high models of everything in the kitchen, hue lights in the whole place, wifi 7 internet with all the rooms having ethernet outlets etc etc etc.

Now my question is: does it make sense to do it? 99% of airbnbs i stayed in was barebones (cheapest coffee makers, cheapest tvs etc), and I just wonder if this will justify bumping the price a little bit to make it more ""premium"" and aim for someone who looks to work remotely (rather than someone who is just looking for a place to stay for a family of 6, because of 3 rooms I have).

INT. APARTMENT 4A – NIGHT

(The gang sits around the coffee table, eating takeout and arguing about comic book logistics.)

HOWARD
I’m telling you, The Thing would beat the Hulk in a straight-up fist fight.

RAJ
No way. Hulk’s power literally grows with his anger.

PENNY
So does mine, and I still can’t lift the couch.

(A loud pop is heard from the kitchen. Everyone glances briefly. Smoke begins curling up behind the stove.)

LEONARD

RAJ
I thought it was space foil. It looked futuristic!

(A low whoosh — flames flicker up from behind the microwave. Nobody moves.)

AMY
Do we still have those marshmallows from game night?

(The fire catches a paper towel roll. It bursts into flame. The fire alarm starts screaming. Sheldon stands immediately.)

SHELDON
Okay. Fire. That’s real fire. That is not a metaphor or an opportunity for snacks. That is actual, lethal combustion.

PENNY
We’ve had worse movie nights.

(A chunk of burning plastic explodes. Amy takes a step back — slips, hits her head on the table, and drops out cold.)

RAJ
Amy’s out!

AUDIENCE: Laughter

HOWARD
She probably just fainted from excitement.

LEONARD
Sheldon, where’s the extinguisher?

SHELDON
Behind the fire.

(The curtain catches. Leonard reaches to pull it down and gets hit with a falling rod. He slumps beside Amy.)

HOWARD
Okay, two down.

(Just then, the door swings open. Through a haze of smoke: Stephen Hawking enters in his motorized wheelchair.)

AUDIENCE: WILD APPLAUSE

STEPHEN HAWKING (via voice box)
Hello, Sheldon. I believe you owe me a chess rematch—

(A flaming beam immediately crashes from the ceiling onto the chair. Sparks fly. The voice module lets out a static whine. He slumps.)

SHELDON
That’s it. Stephen Hawking just got taken out by my kitchen. I hope you’re all proud of yourselves.

(The flames rage. Smoke billows. No one else moves. Penny casually eats a dumpling.)

PENNY
So… Hulk still wins, right?

Boyfriend admitted about 3 weeks ago he went to his ex girlfriends house to collect certificates about a month or so ago. He let out he saw her by mistake, i questioned why didn't he just ask her to post them? He says he feels guilty about it, he had a chat and a coffee with her and a hug goodbye, he said he feels guilty and gross and feels like he cheated. 
I said well you didn't have sex with her or kiss her he said no he didn't. 
I wasnt angry a little hurt by it  but I didn't get angry or cry about it. Just told him next time to communicate with me. 
Since his meeting with her i had noticed he was a bit off, not much sex, a bit distant.

The weekend just passed we had a weekend break together a small holiday. Everything seemed fine we were happy... 
On the Monday he kissed me goodbye said loves me, when he went to work that morning and I went to work and left his house.

All of Monday I didnt get any texts from him which was unusual. So at about 4pm I gave him a text saying hope his day is going well and love him and miss him... No reply.
At 10pm I called him as I had not heard from him, he wasnt talking much i asked if he is ok anything wrong and he said he doesn't know, feels a bit sunstroke, not feeling too well needs space. I asked if he is breaking up with me and he said ""its proberbly for the best""
I cried and tried to communicate and asked if we can work this out what have I done wrong he said I didn't do anything wrong and he needs space he is stressed from work, not feeling too well and feels himself going down a dark hole right nonow.

I cried and cried and told him I will give him space and said hope you feel better soon, bye. I didn't ask for a time frame to connect and discuss anything again.

That was 6 days ago. I've not contacted him. I've not heard from him. 
He hasn't blocked me on social media or whatapp or xbox.

We both have items at each others houses.

As hard as it is I have come to the conclusion I don't want to reach out first. And why should I? He has explaining to do.
If its something I have done such as be too  clingy, relationships should be about communication not bottle it up?

This is not like him at all. We have never had an argument, we have been together for just over a year. 
He has never done anything like this before...

I feel so lost and confused. I just want him to come back and talk this out with me and continue our relationship as before. ",1,1751805788.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

Wow, what a terrible place if you are at all into respecting the lakes and the mountains. The smell of vapes all the way up, rubbish, people throwing their half eaten sandwiches and other wasted food on the floor at the summit, all kinds of terrible footwear and clothing choices - even someone in pyjamas and plimsolls in the pouring rain. 

I really feel for the people who go litter picking and choose to look after it. We brought down some rubbish we saw but my goodness it's a dire experience if you love the lakes. 

I also don't think the National Trust help selling disposable coffee cups at the start of the walk much as I appreciate all they do. 

On a positive, the route involving Ling Mell and the corridor route up was beautiful. We didn't see a single person on Ling Mell. Thoroughly recommend it as a way up (or down) avoiding the zombie hordes.

In her mid-twenties (28), she lives in a cramped studio strewn with notebooks, half-built characters, discarded drafts and finished mugs of coffee. She wears red squiggly lines as a badge of creativity. The glare of her laptop is both her canvas and her persecutor: every new page is a challenge, and every email notification a verdict from the masses. From dawn until she finally sleeps—Ari seeks external confirmation. A single encouraging comment can lift her spirits for days, whilst an empty thread plunges her into self-doubt; a downvote can be figurative and literal death.

Impostor syndrome drives her little 1,000cc Stephen King engine-like heart. Though her shelves hold yet-to-be-acclaimed novels, she believes herself a pro. She only posts snippets to improve her prose and to prove she belongs. Praise feels like currency—proof that the true artists have not yet found her. Scrolling through the Reddit feed, she compares engagement metrics and envies threads that draw more attention than hers.

my husband and I don’t have much help besides my mom and she is easily overwhelmed with our 4 kids. I was an only child so she has never taken care of that many kids before which is understandable. she’s also on the older side and a very anxious person in general so having that many needs to tend to you and responsibility overwhelms her. I totally get it but I also find myself frustrated that she can’t watch them for an hour so my husband and I can go get dinner or get coffee alone. all of our kids are on the young side ranging from 7,5,3, and 1 so it’s A LOT. 

we could hire a babysitter but we are on a very tight budget so it’s hard to justify paying someone to watch them and then paying to go out to dinner too. it adds up! 

we mainly do date nights at home. all of our kids are great about being in bed by 7:30 so we have a lot of time alone in the evening to do things together which is amazing so I can’t really complain too much. I guess it would just be nice to get out during the day alone to do something different but it is a season so trying to remember that.

But I know that if I sleep during the day, I won't sleep at night (and I already have sleep issues at night anyway).

I don't want to use energy drinks, I used to have neighbors that work in the ER and while I already never had interest in them, their stories definitely scared me away. Coffee also doesn't help, which is apparently common with ADHD? Taking a nap doesn't help, walking around, exercising, eating something, drinking water or cold milk, splashing something cold in my face... Nothing seems to help. Nothing will get me some energy.

Hey folks! Let’s face it, the world is racing ahead, and if we aren’t keeping up with the pace of AI, we might as well be left standing at the starting line with a bowl of stale popcorn. 🍿💨 

Remember back in the day when we thought “I’ll just learn it later”? Well, later has a funny way of turning into “Oh no, I missed the boat!” 🚢 There’s no time like the present to start upskilling, especially with AI transforming the job landscape faster than I can finish my morning coffee. ☕️

Here are a few thoughts to chew on:

- **AI isn’t just a buzzword anymore** - It’s here, it’s now, and it’s reshaping industries. If you’re not adapting, there’s a good chance you’ll miss out on some serious moolah. Just imagine your competitors upskilling while you’re still searching for that elusive ‘AI for Dummies’ book. Isn’t that a little bone-chilling? 

- **Cool tools are popping up everywhere** - You’ve got platforms like Jasper and Writesonic making content creation a breeze, but they are only as good as the human behind the screen who knows how to harness their full potential. If you master these tools, that's how you can really work smarter, not harder!

- **Networking with fellow learners** - Surrounding yourself with like-minded people sharing tips and tricks is totally underrated. If you’ve got questions, shout out! Chances are, someone else is thinking the same thing. Remember that time Bob asked how to handle that gnarly prompt, and we all benefited from it? Community wins, my friends. 🎉

My first full day off since the move.

I didn't care what time it was-I needed caffeine, gas, and something to convince me I still existed. Something to tether me to the moment. To prove I hadn't quietly vanished while the town wasn't looking.

That was reason enough to grab my keys and get out of the house before the walls decided to blink again. Before the air grew heavy with that low, watching stillness that always settled right before the lights flickered.

The gas station appeared slowly, rising from the mist like it had been waiting.

It slouched at the edge of the treeline, almost ashamed to still be standing. A squat, tired thing-boards swollen with rot, paint peeled back in curling strips like dead skin. Every corner of it looked half-surrendered to the forest around it. The roof dipped in the center, heavy with moss and soft decay, and the gutters sagged under the weight of old leaves and older nests.

The door was warped, its glass smeared with the fingerprints of people who had come and go. Someone had spray-painted over the station's name years ago. The remnants of the letters were still visible beneath the grime-Bray's, maybe. Or Ray's. Or something else entirely. No one bothered to clean it off.

A single gas pump stood out front like a monument to better times. It was rusted through in places, the numbers on the display too sun-faded to read clearly. The handle hung crooked, the hose stiff and sun-bleached, wrapped once in silver duct tape that fluttered slightly in the windless air. A half-melted air freshener shaped like a tree dangled from the pump, spinning slowly.

Behind it, the building's front window stared out like a dead eye. Dust and mildew caked the glass, but behind it, I could still make out the red glow of a neon sign.

OPEN, it read.
Blink.
Pause.
Blink.

Each pulse slower than the last, like it was dying and didn't want anyone to notice.

The place looked like it hadn't been cleaned since before I was born. It smelled like stale fuel, wet concrete, and something sweet underneath it all-like rotting fruit tucked somewhere behind the walls.

No cars.
No sound.
No birds.

I pulled into the lot.
The gravel popped under my tires like bones snapping, sharp and dry. The sound echoed longer than it should have, swallowed slowly by the trees pressing in at the edges of the lot.

I parked beneath a flickering light that buzzed faintly overhead-though I couldn't tell if it was still trying to stay on or give up entirely. The fog hugged the car as I opened the door, thick and damp, clinging to my jacket like something reluctant to let go.

Inside, the station smelled like everything else in Whistlemoore:
Old.

Like burnt coffee. Dust. And that strange, bitter chemical tang that settled in your throat and stayed behind your teeth, like you'd chewed on copper. The kind of smell that made you wonder if something had died here once-and if it ever really left.

A battered AM radio buzzed low under the counter, nearly lost beneath the hum of the lights. Voices drifted in and out of the static, rising and falling like someone whispering through a blizzard. I couldn't tell if they were speaking English, or if they were speaking at all.

I moved past a crooked aisle, the shelves half-empty and randomly stocked. A single row of cold drinks buzzed weakly at the back wall. I grabbed a bottle of cold brew-a brand I never saw before-and turned toward the counter.

That's when I saw it.

A faded corkboard hung beside the exit, its frame bowed from years of damp and heat. The thumbtacks clinging to it stuck out like tiny rusted teeth, their edges stained and biting into brittle corners.

A few weathered papers still clung to it, stubborn and yellowed:

Lost dog.
Used lawnmower-cheap.
Piano lessons. Ask for Mabel.

The ink had bled from time and moisture, the kind of decay you couldn't fake. They looked as if no one had touched them in years-maybe longer.

Then-

One flyer. Older than the rest.
Its corners brittle, curling upward like burnt paper left too close to flame.

MISSING PERSON

The photo was black and white.
A girl-maybe twenty.
Wide, dark eyes that seemed to watch even in stillness.
Faint freckles scattered across pale cheeks.
Hair tousled and wind-blown, framing a face frozen in time, yet too vivid to forget.

> Name: Eliza Mayfield
Last seen: June 14, 2005
Age at disappearance: 20
Last known location: Wren Hollow, Missouri
Contact local authorities with any information

I stared, unable to look away. Something twisted low in my stomach-not fear exactly, not yet. More like a pressure. A warning.

Wren Hollow.

That wasn't Whistlemoore.
That wasn't even this state.

""What's that doing here?"" I muttered.

The clerk looked up, slowly. ""Hmm?""

""This poster."" I stepped aside so he could see it clearly. ""Eliza Mayfield. She's from Missouri. Why's it pinned up here?""

He glanced over, eyes dull and unbothered, like he was being asked about the weather. For a moment, he looked at the corkboard as though he'd never noticed it before-like he was seeing it through someone else's eyes.

His brow furrowed faintly. Then he shrugged.

""Been there since before I started.""
Another shrug. Too casual. ""Folks leave things sometimes.""

I turned away from the corkboard slowly, drink still gripped in my hand. I hadn't even realized how tightly I was holding it.

The clerk behind the counter was younger than I'd expected-sixteen, maybe, with that awkward lankiness some teenagers never grow out of. His face was smooth but pale, like he didn't see sunlight often. His hair hung long over his eyes, dark and stringy, as if it hadn't been washed in days.

He wore a heavy green hoodie, sleeves pushed up to the elbows, revealing pale wrists with ink smudges and faint reddish marks-scratches or scars, I couldn't tell. His name tag read ""Toby"", though the corner had cracked and curled inward.

Despite his age, he didn't fidget. He didn't glance at his phone. He just stood there, still as stone, eyes on me-not curious, not bored. Just... watching. As if he were waiting to see if I noticed something I wasn't supposed to.

I set the drink on the counter

""Can I get twenty on pump one?""

He nodded once.
No smile. No eye contact.
Just a small, stiff movement-precise, practiced-as he reached for the terminal and tapped a few keys. Each motion felt strangely mechanical, like muscle memory playing out without thought or intent.

""Cash?"" he asked, voice low and gravel-soft. Almost monotone, like it belonged to a throat that didn't use it often.

I slid the bill across the counter. He took it without looking at me.

The machine chirped once. The drawer opened, then shut again in a soft, dull clack. Nothing unusual. Nothing loud.

But then-
The register lit up.

Not green, not blue.
Not any of the colors that meant ""paid"" or ""done"" or ""go.""

Red.

A thin band of crimson light flared silently across the surface of the register.

It wasn't bright, but it was unnervingly clean-sharp around the edges, like the last breath of a coal. It cast a faint hue across Toby's face, washing his skin in something that wasn't quite warmth. The shadows under his eyes deepened. His face looked momentarily hollow. Waxen.

That color.

That exact color.

Since moving to Whistlemoore, it had come to mean one thing-and one thing only.

It wasn't confirmation.
It wasn't success.
It wasn't a receipt or a thank-you.

It meant something had been taken.
And something unseen had accepted.

I didn't say anything. I didn't move. I wasn't sure I could.

The light faded almost immediately. Gone like it had never been.

Toby didn't seem to notice. Or maybe he'd seen it too many times to care.

He tore off the receipt and slid it across the counter toward me. The paper was warm.

""You're good,"" he said, voice still soft, still detached.

I took the receipt with slow fingers, glass bottle tucked beneath my arm. My skin prickled where the red light had touched.

And for the first time in a long time, I wished I hadn't paid at all.

At the grocery store, the register only lit up red when a transaction went through. No paper money. No receipts. Just the color red, glowing like an ember every time something changed hands.

And every time it did, I swore I could feel the air shift. Like the town had taken something from them-and given something back.

I stared at the light now, heart pounding. My fingers itched to snatch the card back before the glow faded. Too late.

""Is... is it supposed to be red?"" I asked quietly.

Toby didn't even look up. ""Means it worked.""

He said it like it was obvious. Like it was nothing.

But it wasn't nothing.

I stood there, staring at the spot where the red light had been, like it might come back if I blinked wrong.

My chest was tight. I hadn't even realized I'd stopped breathing until I forced in a sharp breath-and it didn't help. The air in the station tasted wrong. Flat, like stale paper and copper pennies.

The memory of the register at the grocery store flashed in my mind, uninvited:
That low mechanical beep, the pulse of red light, and the way the whole place seemed to hold still after every accepted payment-as if the town was listening. Taking note.

That same shade had just lit up here.

But then-

My hand touched my pocket.
I'd used cash.

A crumpled twenty I'd pulled out of habit. I remembered flattening it against the edge of the counter. I'd even hesitated, thinking for a second that cash wasn't accepted here either. But Toby had taken it. No hesitation. No mention of the rules that governed the grocery store. No silent judgment.

It was just a twenty-dollar bill.
It wasn't a deal.

I swallowed hard, trying to chase the thought away. My tongue felt too big for my mouth.

I shook my head, jaw clenched. It had to be something else. A broken setting. A wiring issue. Old tech spitting out glitches.

It wasn't the same. It couldn't be the same.

I gripped the bottle tighter and glanced at Toby again.

He was still behind the counter-but he wasn't moving now. Just standing there, arms limp at his sides, gaze fixed not on me, but slightly past my shoulder, like he was watching something I couldn't see. Like something had just walked in behind me.

My pulse jumped, and I spun to look-

Nothing. Just the corkboard. The flyers. The dirty glass door.

And outside, the fog pressed tighter than before, thick and pearled against the window like a breath held too long.

I turned back. Toby blinked slowly and reached under the counter again, as if nothing had happened.

I told myself to move. I needed to move.

""You good?"" I asked, my voice quieter than I expected.

He didn't answer right away. His hand came up slowly and rested on the edge of the counter.

His face didn't change. His tone didn't shift. But the silence that followed was wrong. Thick and heavy, like something had settled over the room that wasn't here when I came in.

I took the bottle and nodded stiffly. ""Thanks.""

I forced myself to move, walking around to the pump like I'd done a thousand times before in other towns, other lives. The nozzle was old, heavy, the kind with a cracked handle and faded warning stickers. I slid it into the tank and flipped the lever.

The pump wheezed, coughed, then rumbled to life with a sound like an animal clearing its throat. The numbers rolled slow on the display, old-school and mechanical. $1.10... $1.45... $2.05...

While it filled, I popped the lid on my drink and took a long, deep swig.

The cold brew was sharper than I expected. Bitter, almost sour. Probably expired. Probably the last bottle they had. But I didn't care.

I chugged half of it without thinking.

And just like that-
The fog didn't seem so close.

The caffeine hit with a strange clarity, like my thoughts straightened their spines. My breath fogged out in front of me and felt like mine again. My nerves were still on edge, but I could at least breathe.

I leaned against the car, bottle still in hand, and let my head fall back against the roof. The metal was cool, grounding.

From here, I could take in the full sight of the station.

It was worse than I'd noticed from inside.

The white paint had peeled away in long ribbons, exposing swollen wood beneath. The walls leaned unevenly, like the whole building had started sinking and no one bothered to fix it. Moss curled along the lower edges. One of the windows had been duct-taped from the inside. A neon sign once advertising ICE now read just I_E, the missing letter long burned out.

Above it all, the roof sagged like a tired exhale. The light above the door flickered, then stuttered off completely, leaving the glass dark.

The place looked less like a business and more like the idea of a business. Something left behind in a hurry. Or something that never quite belonged in the first place.

The pump ticked past $17. I watched it idly, forcing myself to relax, to let my spine soften against the car. Let my thoughts wander. Let them forget.

The pump clicked off with a dull clunk, the numbers freezing just past twenty.

I lingered a second longer, the empty bottle still in my hand, the caffeine crackling faintly in my bloodstream like tiny sparks under skin. Then I shook myself, straightened up, and moved to hang the handle back on its cradle. It slipped into place with a mechanical thunk, the nozzle crusted in old, dried fuel and rust around the edges.

I got back into the car and shut the door behind me. The click of it closing felt too loud. Like it had ended something.

The engine started on the first try this time.

I exhaled.

Everything was fine.

Just a weird morning. Just a strange gas station. Just caffeine and fog and a face on a poster I'd never seen before.

I pulled out slowly, tires crunching over gravel, and eased back onto the main road leading toward town. Fog hugged the trees on both sides, but the visibility had improved just enough to make out the shapes beyond it.

And that's when I noticed them.

Houses.

Not far-off cabins or distant farmhouses, but homes. Ordinary, suburban structures-white fences, sagging porches, windows dim behind drawn curtains. They weren't there before. I was sure of it. I'd taken this same road half a dozen times and seen nothing but endless forest.

There was a narrow two-story with a child's swing hanging from a dead branch in the yard.
A yellow ranch-style house with lace curtains and a broken rocking chair turned toward the road.
A small brick cottage with a line of pale laundry pinned up-but nothing stirred in the windless air.

People lived here. Or used to.

I gripped the wheel tighter. Slowed down slightly.

A man stood on a porch a few houses down, wearing a long coat despite the chill. He didn't wave. Didn't move. Just stared as I passed. His features were hard to make out through the fog, but his posture was deliberate. Like he wanted me to see him. Like he was waiting for something else.

Two streets down, a woman in a long nightgown stood on her front lawn barefoot, arms at her sides. Her hair was wet. Her eyes followed my car without blinking.

I looked away quickly.

I hadn't seen these people before. Not once.

And Whistlemoore wasn't a place where you missed things. There wasn't enough of it to miss.

The further I drove, the more it felt like I was passing through a neighborhood I'd never been allowed to see until now. As if the town was slowly unfolding itself. Stretching. Waking up.

The houses grew farther apart as I drove, swallowed again by the trees and the heavy veil of fog. I kept glancing at the rearview mirror, half-expecting those silent neighbors to still be watching from their porches, their windows, their lawns.

But the road behind me was empty.

I exhaled. My knuckles ached from how tight I was gripping the wheel.

I turned a corner I knew well-a sharp bend just before the woods parted into a clearing-and that's when I saw it.

I tapped the brakes. Slowed. Then stopped completely in the middle of the road.

There, just off the shoulder in the trees, was a house.
Not just any house.

My house.

Not the one I rented from Mrs. Shirley.
Not one of the creeping Victorian ghosts in town.
The house I grew up in.

Back in Dalemar Ridge. Two states away. Long gone.

It was just... there.

Squatting between the trees like it had always belonged. The same cracked white siding. The faded green shutters. The crooked satellite dish that never worked. Even the rusted basketball hoop still bolted over the garage door. My father had promised to fix it the summer before everything fell apart.

I blinked. Hard. Once. Twice.

Still there.

Nestled in a patch of clearing that hadn't existed five minutes ago.

My hands trembled on the wheel. For a long moment, I didn't breathe.

This isn't real.
It can't be real.
I hadn't seen that house in over ten years. Not since the fire.

The curtains in the front window swayed gently, though there was no breeze.
The porch light flickered once.
Then again.

Like someone was home.

I slowly reached down and put the car in park, engine idling. My foot stayed planted, heavy on the brake.

I wasn't sure how long I stared. The world around me had gone completely silent. Not even the fog dared move.

I told myself I was imagining it.
I told myself it was a trick of memory, of caffeine and fear and fog.

I eased my foot off the brake and let the car crawl forward.

The gravel under the tires no longer crunched-it whispered, soft and brittle, like bones under snow. My heart thudded slow and wrong, slightly out of sync with the hum of the engine. Ahead, the clearing opened like a held breath. Still. Waiting.
The world had paused for something.

And there it was.
My old driveway.

Exactly as I remembered it-
Cracked concrete veined with moss.
Pine needles strewn in the seams like confetti after a funeral.
The faint slope to the left where my bike used to wobble.

I turned in without thinking. My hands knew the motion before I gave the command. My body remembered this path in a way my mind hadn't dared to in years.

And then-
The house.

Closer now. And real in the worst possible way.

The screen door hung crooked, half-open, the way it always had. The third porch step sagged slightly in the middle-dipped in the shape of my childhood.
The garden hose lay coiled beside the garage, in its usual tangled mess, split halfway down where I'd run it over with my bike when I was seven.

Unchanged.

Untouched.

As if time hadn't passed at all.

And that was what terrified me.

I let the car come to a full stop. Engine idling. One hand clenched on the wheel, the other hovering just above my lap, useless.

I blinked.

And the house was gone.

No warning.
No flicker.
No sound.
No sigh of wood or whisper of wind.

Just absence.

The clearing was still there, framed by trees that seemed to lean in a little more now, like they were hiding something. But the house-

Vanished.

No cracked siding.
No porch swing.
No broken garage light.

Only damp soil. A few crushed plants. Scattered pine needles and a sag in the ground where the driveway might have once been-if anything had ever stood there at all.

My headlights cut across the clearing in two silent beams. They found nothing but fog and stillness.

I blinked again-slower this time.

Still nothing.

I hadn't imagined it.
I knew the feel of that porch step under my foot. The warped siding. The smell of the damp basement that never quite dried.
I knew that house.
And for a moment, it had known me back.

My hands clutched the wheel tighter, blood pulsing against my palms.
I stared forward until my eyes stung and the cold of the air settled into my spine.

Something moved.

Just a flicker-barely more than a breath against the edge of my vision.

I froze. My foot hovered over the gas.

In the rearview mirror, a figure stood in the center of the road-back where the trees loomed thick and too quiet, where the air felt stretched thin.

A silhouette.
Still. Unmoving.
Watching.

The fog curled around its legs like it belonged there, like the forest had grown it instead of letting it walk in.

I leaned closer to the glass, heart hammering out of rhythm, eyes squinting against the murk. My breath fogged the window.

Tall. Thick frame.
One shoulder slouched slightly, like he'd been caught mid-turn.
His jacket-a dark corduroy, dull and soft-looking, like something older than memory.

The posture stopped my heart cold.

I knew that stance.

That stillness.

Mr. Stantsman.

It looked like him-down to the subtle slope of his spine, the quiet angle of his head tilted just enough to feel wrong.

My boss.

The man who moved like silence was something sacred.
Who never asked questions, only stared a beat too long.
Who smelled faintly of old paper and cold metal, even in summer.

Now he stood on a dark road, beneath trees I didn't recognize-his eyes locked to the back of my car.

I whispered his name. Just to hear it.
Just to see if the sound made any sense anymore.

It didn't.

My hand trembled as I rubbed at my eyes with my sleeve. I blinked again, harder, like I could push the image out of existence.

When I looked up-

He was gone.

No footsteps.
No motion.
No parting in the fog to show he'd ever been there.

Just emptiness.

A hollow space that suddenly felt far too close.

I sat there, hands rigid on the wheel, lips parted like I'd been about to speak. But nothing came out.
Not even breath.

My stomach turned over-once, slow and deep, like the world had shifted underneath me.

I didn't remember starting the engine.
But the key turned.
The car moved.

I didn't check the mirror again.

I kept the car steady, creeping down Whistlemoore's narrow roads like I was afraid the town might shift beneath me if I moved too fast.
It felt like it could.

The pavement blurred beneath the tires, soft with fog, slick with something that looked like dew but clung too thick. The air pressed in around the windshield-dense and damp-fog curling like smoke across the glass, as though something just outside wanted to be seen... but not clearly.

The streetlamps lining the road were of no help.

They flickered erratically, casting light that seemed to bend wrong angles across the street-long, unnatural shadows that jittered when I wasn't looking straight at them. Some lamps pulsed like heartbeats, others dimmed into near nothing, then surged back with a sickly gold hue that turned the road the color of old parchment.

The fog had grown teeth.
It licked at the car windows in slow spirals.
And it was getting harder to tell where the town ended and something else began.

My hands wouldn't leave the wheel. I was gripping it like it was the only thing tethering me to solid ground. My pulse throbbed in my wrists, sharp and quick, out of rhythm with the low idle hum of the engine.

Everything in me felt wound too tight.
Like I was driving inside a held breath.

I didn't mean to take the long way home.

But the streets kept looping.
Storefronts I didn't remember appeared and vanished again. Houses shifted slightly between blinks-curtains that hadn't been drawn now covered the windows. A porch light that had been dead flickered on as I passed.

And then-
the playground.

I didn't remember a playground on this side of town.

It rose up suddenly from the fog-a hunched silhouette of rusted metal and sagging plastic, nestled behind a crumbling chain-link fence. The swings moved. Just slightly. Not from wind.

I turned onto my street like it might vanish if I didn't claim it fast enough-like if I blinked, Whistlemoore would rearrange itself again, and I'd be swallowed whole.

My porch light flickered weakly ahead, barely piercing the fog. It pulsed once, twice, then steadied into a sickly yellow glow. As I pulled into the cracked gravel drive, it sputtered again-like it had seen me, then reconsidered.

I sat for a beat too long.

Hands still clenched on the wheel.

Headlights casting their beams across the yard-warped steps, choked weeds, the faint outline of my front door leaning slightly to the left like it didn't want to be found.

I moved fast.

Keys in hand. Jacket clenched tight around me like a second skin. The wind hadn't moved all night, but the air shifted around me-thick and slow, like I was walking through breath not my own.

The gravel shifted beneath my boots, crunching sharp, too loud, like it echoed into some place I couldn't see.

Up the steps-
One, two, skip the third.
Key in the lock.
Twist.
Click.
Open.

I didn't hesitate.

I slammed the door behind me like something might follow, like the air itself needed to be kept out. I locked all three bolts in practiced succession-top to bottom-and yanked the little chain across with a snap that rang too loud in the silence.

My breathing came hard now. Quick, shallow.
The kind that only shows up when you're trying to pretend you're calm.

My jacket hung crooked on my shoulders, one sleeve twisted and inside-out. I didn't fix it.

I kicked off my shoes without looking, nearly tripping over the welcome mat that hadn't been welcome in years, and hurried down the narrow hallway like something unseen might still be right behind me.

Bedroom.

Door shut.

Click.

Safe.

The moment I hit the bed, it felt like something in me unspooled-like all the breath I hadn't taken in the last hour suddenly came rushing back. The sheets were cold, but grounding. The weight of the blanket familiar. The bed sagged just enough on the left side-same as always. My head sank into the pillow like I'd never left it.

The ceiling above me was cracked in the corner, spiderweb lines that had been there since I moved in.
They hadn't moved.
They hadn't grown.

The one floorboard near the dresser let out a soft groan, but that was normal. It always had.
That was safe.

The shadows in here didn't move.

I curled inward, clutching the blanket up to my chin like a shield.

I was home.
I had locked the door.
I was in my bed.

Safe.

...Right?

It went better than I had expected, and a week later (july 4) i was able to spend the holiday with friends who have a view of a few fireworks displays in south Seattle.

it was not without problems -- one of the things I've apparently been masking off from myself is how bad my balance and stamina are. 

I had a few instances of dissociation but nothing like a panic attack.  At this point, I think it's likely to be more manageable than I had initially feared.

I want to just leave a few breadcrumbs -- significant things that I believe helped contribute to this:

1) Med review/med change -- I'd been on the same dosages of the same things the entire time I've been isolating, so like 2019 to present.  In my case, venlafaxine/effexor seems to have been causing anxiety.

2) New therapist -- not sure I'm going to stick with this person once the program I'm in ends, but he's been insightful and helpful.

3) An intense outpatient program (IOP) that involves group therapy sessions of 90 minutes at least 8 times a week.  

I don't know whether it's dropping the venlafaxine or interacting with other people with a broad variety of issues that has helped facilitate the progress i've made.   

Anyone reading this might benefit from a med review, but I'm not advocating for that so much as being open-minded and asking your pharm guy /psychiatrist a ton of questions. 

I do think most people who haven't experienced an IOP might want to consider it - but if you're in the US make double damned sure that you speak to your insurance company's people yourself over whether or not its covered and to what extent you might have to go out of pocket to get into it.


I'm not trying to give advice other than talk to your MH providers about it and be open to trying things out.    

I still have a huge amount of anxiety about going out and wlll still use any excuse i can to support *not* going. But I've also found that things weren't as bad for me as I anticipate they would be.  One of the things I was terrified of happening actually did happen -- I fell down on the floor in a coffee shop and needed help from people to get my balance back.

The thing about it is that it happened, but was not the complete and total disaster  I was afraid would result.   I had a moment, nice people helped me and that was it.",3,1751804595.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Dubai Marina for over a year now — and I thought it might help others if I shared some real-life pros and cons of the area, especially for people who are thinking about moving here or just arrived.

Here’s my quick honest breakdown:

**✅ Pros:**

* Everything is walkable — Marina Walk, gyms, cafes, supermarkets
* Metro + tram combo is super convenient (yes, car-free life is doable)
* Great vibe in winter — you feel like you’re on holiday all the time
* Tons of dining options, both local favorites and fancier places
* Buildings with good maintenance feel like 5-star hotels

**❌ Cons:**

* Traffic and noise on weekends, especially near Marina Mall
* Some older towers have very high service charges (and weak A/C in summer)
* Can feel too touristy during high season (Dec–Feb)
* Gym memberships and coffee runs add up fast if you’re not careful

If anyone's considering moving here, or already here and still figuring it out — happy to answer questions about:

* Real rent prices
* Best buildings (from my experience and friends)
* How safe it really feels
* Grocery, delivery life without a car
* Remote work setup tips

1lszvic,https://www.reddit.com/r/FordExplorerEV/comments/1lszvic/range_with_caravan/,Range with caravan,"I just have to get this off my chest. I have a lot to complain about my Ford. But that's mainly the software and the operation and such. Not the hardware.

I just got back from 2 weeks with the caravan to the GP of Austria. And that all went very easily and beyond expectations. Because I'm a bit older and I'm no longer 'driving to the south of France in one go with the diesel'. After 200km everything starts to creak and squeak and that's not the caravan or the car.

On the way back I thought I'd try to push it to the limit. And the conditions were perfect. Not perfect for speeding up, but perfect for testing the range with a caravan. It was hot and very busy. The average speed was therefore lower than usual. Sometimes traffic jams, but generally an average of 85kmh. I'm only allowed to drive 80 in Germany, but I drive with the fastest freight traffic. On the way there it was usually around 94, now only 85.

It was from a campsite called ‘Hohe Wand’ near Vienna, to a campsite along the motorway near Wurzburg over a distance of 635 km. The navigation had recommended a detour because of a traffic jam that took me straight through Linz and Passau. That was not nice and does not make it any more efficient.

I started those 635 km with 83% and after only s 1 (One, Uno, Eins, Une, Één) charging stop to 93%, which I needed much more than the Ford, I arrived in Wurzburg with 15%. That 93% was therefore unnecessary long.

I needed that charging time myself for coffee, sandwiches, toilet, and a short sit.

Two stints of well over 300 km with plenty of leeway. In theory I could have driven 400 km that day under those conditions with a f\*kking caravan!",1,1751804411.0,FordExplorerEV,0,1.0,False

**My girlfriend is turning 21 and wants me (21M) to throw her a party. How do I break the news that no one will show up?**



Birthdays have always been hard on my girlfriend. She's had a few parties as a child where no one showed up, and since moving states in the middle of high school she hasn't made close friends.

Here at college, she tries hard to make friends. She talks well to people on a superficial basis but doesn't have any real friends. She's never been invited to a college party and has often missed out on many typical activities.

We've been together for 3 years, since freshman orientation. I don't have friends but I'm happy that way. I like keeping to myself if I'm not spending time with her. Since she's naturally extroverted, she spends her free time with me, or at club meetings trying to connect to people.

She's asked if I could put together a small party so I invited some acquaintances, my roommates, etc. everyone said no. I gave the invites well in advance too. I don't know how to break the news to my girlfriend, she's been so excited. She thought providing free food and drink would be a great way to make friends. But people don't want to come for even that. What can I do?

tl;dr: My friendly but friendless girlfriend wanted me to throw a 21st birthday party for her, but no one accepted. How do I still make this a special day? How do I tell her without crushing her?



**Comments**



**\[deleted\]**

*Why do all these people you know (friends, roommates, etc) dislike her enough not to come? If she is extroverted, what's going wrong with how she interacts with people to make them not want to be around her?*

>OOP: I don't know. She can be a bit silly and goofy, but I like that about her. She doesn't cause drama, she's a good listener, has a good sense of humor. She's extroverted but tends to be shy around new people. She also tends to act pretty differently depending on the person. I do that too to an extent. Honestly I don't know why people are all declining. I've never been invited to a party but I'd go to support someone.

**\[deleted\]**

*Why don't you ask them?*

>OOP: They all make BS excuses about being busy. Some of these people I know are not busy that day. I don't think they want to insult her to my face.

**huntgather**

*They probably don't actually dislike her. They're probably basically neutral about her and are surprised that they're invited to her party. Did you tell them that it's a small party? People will attend big parties even if they're not super close to the host, but a small party basically says ""close friends only."" They may even feel that you were mistaken in inviting them if they think it's a small party for her best friends.*

*Edit: Recently a woman invited me and a few of my friends to her birthday party. We weren't close with her and definitely wouldn't have gone to her apartment for drinks because it would feel weird since, again, we weren't close. BUT. Her party was a karaoke party, which is something my friends and I like to do anyway. So we showed up and had a great time with her. Is there anything that your acquaintances love to do that you could build your party around instead of drinking?*



**Update - 1 day later**



I logged into facebook at like 2 AM last night and my girlfriend has posted a message on the party event wall saying the party was cancelled. She saw the no-shows before I could let her know about it.

I called her and suggested some other activities we could do, things like amusement parks or concerts or taking a cooking class. I thought she'd like all those ideas.

""No thank you.""

We were kinda quiet over the phone, until she asked me in a really small voice if I could come over.

We met outside her dorm at like 3 in the morning. She was crying, as I expected. But it was just watery eyes, not full on sobs how she usually cries.

""It's okay,"" she said. ""Some people aren't meant to have friends.""

I told her she was exaggerating, that she just needs to look in different places, etc. She shook her head. ""No, I'm done.""

This morning at breakfast we passed a lot of mutual acquaintances. Usually my girlfriend smiles and says hello. Today she just kept her eyes on the pavement, not looking at anyone. She barely ate. But other than that she seemed like her normal self with me, talking and laughing. She just wouldn't look at anyone else.

She told me how she's going to use this extra time to get better in her classes, to work on her jewelry and maybe open an etsy shop. To read more books.

I asked her if this is really what she wanted.

""No, but life doesn't always give you what you want. I didn't want to be an engineer. I didn't want to live in a basement alone. I didn't want to hate college and wish every day that I could drop out. But you make the best of it.""

Her voice was breaking as she said this, but she didn't cry. She left the breakfast table after that and said she wanted to be alone.

Where the hell do I go from here? Her actual birthday is tomorrow (we were throwing the party a week later) and she insists she doesn't want to do anything. Is it bad that part of me sort of agreed with her, that some people aren't meant to make friends? I don't think I am, but obviously she wants friends and it's making her miserable.

tl;dr: Girlfriend canceled party, said she didn't want to do anything for her birthday, and announced that she's given up on finding friends. She isn't going back to any of her clubs or activities, and is going to focus on her studies and hobbies this coming year. Her actual 21st birthday is tomorrow. Where do I go from here?

EDIT: I am sitting with her in her dorm room right now. She's on the bed reading, I'm on the couch minding my own business, just being near her. She is okay.



**Comments**



**relathrow404**

I've read the entirety of your other thread and your comments here, and I have a few thoughts that I hope you won't take personally. You seem to truly care for your girlfriend and I think you're a great boyfriend to her. That being said...

Neither of you seem to understand social interactions, and you seem to be reinforcing each other's misunderstandings. You wrote that she skips from group to group events but ""hasn't even been able to get a girl to go for coffee with her."" That's understandable. You would have to meet up in a group setting a few times in college to be memorable and comfortable enough for a one-on-one invite. I feel like she fails on getting the one-on-one invite and she feels as though she's doing something wrong, and you feel as though she's doing something wrong, when in reality she's approaching the situation incorrectly to begin with.

If she wants to make friends, she should sign up for book clubs, knitting circles, jewelry making groups, and go to them continuously. Go to [www.meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) and find some groups for her in your area. They will usually have a good mix of college kids and older in a college town, giving her exposure to people in all stages of life and -- more importantly -- social spectrums. These are people who want to make friends.

Frankly, the fact that you aren't interested in friends is holding her back, though that's not your fault. She wants to be social and has entered into a cycle of not having friends -> getting desperate -> alienating people through desperation -> not having friends. You may feel as though she should ""just give up,"" but if she picks up on that, it's only going to make her worse. She is clearly a social person.

I have a feeling that you not wanting friends ""as a personal choice,"" and focusing solely on work and your girlfriend, is deterring many people who know you two as a couple. They probably see you as cold and/or emotionless, even if you don't mean to be that way. It is unusual to be disinterested in friendship, especially after so long. You've had roommates for three or four years in college, get along reasonably well with them, and yet have never been interested in them as friends; of course they won't come to your girlfriend's party! I wouldn't want to either. I would feel weirded out by even being asked.

If you want to help your girlfriend, you may just have to step outside of your own social comfort zone a little and at least try to be a little friendlier. Couples tend to meet people together, and if you're coming off as aloof and not needing human interaction ""by choice,"" you're going to run people off away from her.

Edit: By the way, I don't mean to put the onus on you to change. If she was here asking for advice, I would be focusing on her. But she's already gotten some great advice from other people here, and I wanted to comment on some things that were sticking out to me in your replies.



**Update - 2 days later**



""Short update here. I stayed with my girlfriend for a while last night. She just read a book and didn't talk much. I cuddled her a bit, but she mostly wanted space.

This morning, I came to her room with flowers and a gift. She accepted the flowers with a smile. She told me she wanted to go home to her parents this weekend. I was pretty sad about that, I wanted to make her feel loved and special. But she said she needed to get off campus for a bit, so I said okay. I took her to the bus stop, said goodbye, and now here I am.

She did love the present though. It was a book she'd been wanting for a while.

Hopefully she'll feel better when she comes back.

tl;dr Girlfriend went home for her birthday.""



**Comments**



**AdmanUK**

*You have done the right thing so far, so very well done, you are a hell of a guy. One thing though, you might want to ring ahead and tell her parents what happened. I know she seems okay but you don't go from the level of sadness she has had over the last few days to 'okay' that quickly. Might be best if they keep an eye on her.*

>OOP: She's already home by now (it's not very far) and they're likely celebrating her birthday. I don't really want to put a damper on things, she obviously wants to move on.

**AdmanUK**

*Ah fair enough then. Still, credit to you, you are an awesome boyfriend and a great human being. I know everyone is feeling for your girlfriend right now (including myself) but you have been through hell too. I've been in similar situations and I know how helpless and useless you feel but you are doing all the right things. Top human marks for you.*

>OOP: Thanks, I appreciate it.

**aliceinborderland**

*Remember what people said in your last update...maybe just a quick call to be sure she arrived safely, nothing more needed.*

>OOP: She called me once she got there, she's fine.



**Update - 2 months later**



Anyway, the school year is in full swing and she cries all the time. At least three times a week, if not more. She feels like she's taking advantage of my kindness so she tries not to cry in front of me. She's completely abandoned the search to find friends, and doesn't go out except for food, class, etc. There are happy moments too, and she'll still go out with me, but she just seems fragmented over all.

She actually did pursue therapy at our university, because she felt like she really needed someone to talk to that wasn't me. They informed her that all the spots they had were full and that unless she was a suicide risk they didn't have room. Heartless, right? It really made her feel bad, but she didn't want to lie and say she was a suicide risk.

She feels lonelier than ever. There's no doubt in my mind that she's depressed. She pours all her energy into schoolwork and hasn't really touched her hobbies much, either.

She can't afford therapy other than the university, and they won't give it to her. Is there any way she can get the help she needs?

tl;dr: My girlfriend's depression is getting worse, she tried to get therapy and was informed that she couldn't. Is there anything she/we can do?



**Comments**



**\[deleted\]**

*Lastly, and this might be difficult to hear - but she needs to stop placing so much of a priority on people liking her and wanting to hang out with her. I learned long ago that some people just won't like you - and that's perfectly OK. Nothing at all you can do about it. She should pursue her interests, join clubs, etc. When she begins appearing more confident and well-adjusted, friendships will naturally follow.*

*DING DING DING KNOCKOUT*

>OOP: That's what she's been doing for the last three years. She was actually pretty confident for a while, but I guess she always thought she would've made one or two friends by now and it's starting to crash down around her.

**\_procyon**

*You're in your senior year right? Unfortunately by now most people already HAVE a circle of friends - it's going to be much harder to suddenly become the new person in a group who have been hanging out together for years. Close friends in college may not happen for her. She should focus more on getting through school and what comes after - who knows, maybe everyone in her new job will love her! At the very least it will be a fresh start.*

*Have you considered moving in together after school? I'm pretty introverted and don't hang out with people much, but I come home to my boyfriend every day and that means a lot to me, I don't ever feel lonely.*

>OOP: We do plan to move in together, I plan to propose after graduation. But she doesn't have any plans for herself for after graduation, so I don't know if she'll be happy or not.

**\_procyon**

*Then that's my advice to you - stop focusing on college and focus on what comes after. She needs to start making plans - she is planning to have a career right? Can she look into getting an internship in something related to her field?*

*Please remind her that she will be starting all over again after she graduates anyway -- stick it out and then just keep trying.*

>OOP: She's in a major she hates, so she's been avoiding everything related to after graduation. I worry about what she's going to do too, she's very smart but her major isn't right for her at all, so if she got into industry she'd probably hate it.

**\_procyon**

Well she's gotta figure it out eventually so why not now? She has to work somewhere after graduating or you are going to end up supporting her financially.

>OOP: I don't mind supporting her, but I know she wouldn't like that. She might be thinking about a plan, but she hasn't talked about it much. I don't mind supporting her, but I know she wouldn't like that. She might be thinking about a plan, but she hasn't talked about it much.

**\_procyon**

*So talk to her about it. Help her make a concrete plan, then start taking steps to make it happen. Start figuring it out - where are you guys going to live? What career path is she going to choose? What can she do NOW, today, to make it easier to get into that career? You say you want to help, so help her - that is going to involve the two of you actually DOING something.*

>OOP: I mean, she'll live with me, I've gotten a job and such. She already plans to move with me. But I do agree that she needs to figure out a plan for herself. She wouldn't be happy just staying at home.

Confesso que, pelo preço (18,60€ por 250g), hesitei várias vezes antes de avançar. Mas...revelou-se, sem dúvida, o melhor descafeinado que já provei até hoje, ainda q, eu n tenha experiência com descafeinados de especialidade.

Rivaliza por completo com cafés cafeinados de especialidade, e até superou um Colômbia de 88 pontos (de outro roaster) que estou a beber este mês. Diria que ninguém que prove este café diga que é um descafeinado, de tanta qualidade que tem.

A embalagem indica que é direcionado para expresso, mas surpreendeu pela versatilidade — funcionou lindamente também em filtro, o que agradou bastante todos cá em casa que o experimentaram.

Aromáticamente falando, é um café muito frutado e doce, mas que é compensada por uma elevada acidez, que lhe confere um equilíbrio e frescura brutal. Um grande café de verão.

Parabéns à Buraca Roasters pela escolha deste grão e pela torra bem executada.

For the past few months, my machine occasionally stops producing coffee, and the red water LED turns on. The error message says that the coffee is flowing too slowly.

I’ve cleaned everything thoroughly, including descaling and rinsing all removable parts, but the issue keeps coming back from time to time.

I suspect that either the grinder, brew unit, or the pump might be the problem. The grinder might be worn out due to the machine’s age (which is unknown), and I’ve already experimented with different grind settings, but it didn’t really help.

I’d prefer not to replace everything at once. Which component should I check or replace first?

Thanks for your help!",1,1751803905.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False
