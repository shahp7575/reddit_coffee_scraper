Training
I'm 36M.  This was my second marathon, the only other back in 2022 in Philadelphia.  Since then, I got married and had a child so I backed off on my training for a couple years.  I started entering in shorter races the past year and had the desire to complete another marathon this year.  Recently PR'd my 5k time at 17:12.

I was coming out of a triathlon training block with base mileage around 30mpw.  I developed a 14 week training plan starting at 32mpw and peaking at 55mpw.  I followed the same weekly schedule.
Monday - Rest
Tuesday - Intervals between 800m to 1600m at around 6:00/mi pace
Wednesday - Easy miles increasing as I added overall weekly miles
Thursday - Tempo runs at 6:40/mi.  Start of training block at 5 miles runs and increased to 8 mile tempo runs
Friday - Easy miles
Saturday - Cycling (or make day for a workout I missed during the week)
Sunday - Long Run.  Longest I did was 22 miles.  Pace usually around 7:30/mi.

Pre-race
I increased my carb intake two days prior to the race.  The day prior I targeted 700g of carbs.
I ate a bagel with peanut butter, a coffee, and a sports drink the morning of the race.
I arrived at the starting line about a half hour before the race was to start.  After using the bathroom, I took my first gel about 10 minutes before the race began.

Race
The course is 30% paved road and 70% dirt/crushed gravel, a slight net downhill course.  Temperatures in the high 40s, low 50s by the end of the race.
The first half mile was downhill so I wasn't too concerned about starting my first mile at 6:09, but knew I had to make a conscious effort not to keep up that pace once the course flattened out.
After about 6 miles, I found a good pace that I felt I could sustain for the first 20 miles, then see what I had left in the tank.
I consumed gels at every 5 miles (4 in race, 1 pre-race).  Alternated between Gatorade and water at the aide stations.
After 19 miles, I was still feeling good and started to try to pick up the pace.  Looking at the mile splits, I averaged around 6:27 for the final 7 miles (vs 6:44 for the first 19 miles).  I definitely felt that increased pace in my legs, after feeling good for the first 24ish miles.

Post-race
I felt really good with my time and happy with my splits.  But there is a small part of me that looked at this years Boston accepted time for my age group at 2:55:26 and thought shaving another minute could get me a qualifying time in the future.  But now that I have worked my mileage up further than I have before in my life, it could be a good opportunity to increase weekly milage a little further and look at a spring marathon to see if I can get sub 2:55

1oteq3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1oteq3g/i_tried_a_no_meeting_morning_for_one_week_here_is/,"I tried a no meeting morning for one week, here is how it felt when you are not in tech","My job is a mix of customer emails, a few phone calls, some light paperwork. Nothing fancy, not an engineer, not a coder. Lately I noticed that my whole morning gets chewed up by quick syncs that are never quick. By lunch I am already tired and still behind. So I asked my boss if I could try a simple rule for five workdays. No meetings or calls before noon unless a client is truly stuck. I promised to send short updates by 11 and keep afternoons open for calls. She said ok, let us see.



Day 1 I sat down at 8 with a glass of water, not coffee, and wrote a tiny plan on paper. Three lines only, answer billing emails, finish two forms, prepare a draft for Thursday. I put my phone in another room. By 9 I had handled the worst inbox items. By 10 I did a ten minute stretch and a short walk in my hallway. At 11 I posted a two sentence update in our chat, what I finished, what I will do after lunch. No fancy templates, just plain words. It felt quiet and weird in a good way.



By mid week the difference was obvious. I was not rushing into calls with my heart racing. Clients got faster written replies because I was not juggling a headset. When afternoon calls came, I was prepared and calmer. I started to prep questions ahead of time, and calls got shorter without anyone being grumpy. I even had time to cut fruit for a snack, which sounds small but stops the crash later. I also noticed fewer typos because my brain was not switching every ten minutes.



The only hiccups. One coworker tried to book a 9 am anyway. I replied with the new rule and gave two slots after lunch. No drama, it worked. Another day my kid had a school thing and I missed the walk, and I could feel it, so I did five minutes of steps in place before a call. It looks silly but it helped. Now my boss wants others to try the same pilot. If your role is support, sales, teaching online, bookkeeping, design, anything really, a quiet morning can change your day. Keep it simple. No fancy tools. A short plan, a clear update, and a boundary that you actually keep.

Next thing I know, she’s in an auto right next to me, still looking my way. Fifteen seconds of pure eye contact. I wanted to say something, but my brain went full 404. And then… she was gone.

Always order the same thing, sit in the same corner, headphones on for 3-4 hours.

Here's the thing though - I take a lot of video calls. Client meetings, project updates, casual chats with other freelancers. And I'm one of those people who talks with my hands a lot, makes faces at the screen, laughs way too loud.

Yesterday the barista comes over during a quiet moment and goes ""So do you like, coordinate meetups here? I see you meeting with different people every single day.""

I was so confused until I realized - she thinks I'm having in-person meetings. She's been watching me animatedly chat with my laptop for six months and assumed there were actual people sitting across from me that she somehow never noticed.

I tried to explain I do video calls but she looked so embarrassed I just said ""yeah, I meet a lot of clients here"" and left it at that.

Now I'm wondering how many other people in this coffee shop think I'm the most popular person alive, scheduling back-to-back meetings from 9am-1pm every day.

1oteln3,https://www.reddit.com/r/weezly/comments/1oteln3/from_0_to_100k_followers_my_2025_linkedin_growth/,"From 0 to 100k Followers: My 2025 LinkedIn Growth Blueprint (No Ads, No Team)","My first few years on LinkedIn felt pointless—random connections, silent posts, zero traction. I figured followers happened to 'bigger' names, not people starting fresh.

Then I decided to wipe the slate clean. I removed noisy connections, optimized my profile, and built a ""Dream 100""—the actual people I wanted in my sphere. Overnight, my DMs became about real opportunities, not automated spam.

Three things made all the difference:

- Auditing my network ruthlessly (don’t be scared to hit ‘remove’ — it’s liberating)
- Dropping generic content to micro-niche down: one problem, one audience, one clear offer
- Prioritizing thoughtful comments over posts at first—especially in my target industry’s early-morning threads. It got me noticed, invited, introduced.  

Weezly Connect helped keep track of these conversations and made video outreach inside LinkedIn actually work (asynchronous intros, less ghosting). Scheduling coffee chats became a one-click deal with Weezly Scheduling—no more endless back-and-forth.

Best part? You don’t need a big budget or logo. The consistency compounds: three months in, your feed transforms and inbound leads follow.

If you want a step-by-step playbook (with templates, real stats, and profile examples), here’s the exact process I followed — might save you a few years of trial and error:

Estou querendo dar um mini kit (prensa, moedor e um saco de grãos) pra ela de natal, mas estou me sentindo perdido frente a quantidade de possibilidades. O grande porém é que meu orçamento está (para os preços que tenho visto) um pouco apertado. Gostaria de gastar, idealmente, menos de 500 reais no total. 

Entendi que para os grãos, devo separar em torno de 50 reais (tenho alguns em mente, mas, caso queira, tenho certeza que vocês terão muito a dizer tanto sobre o preço quanto recomendações). Então teria mais ou menos 200 reais para gastar com os outros dois.

As recomendações de moedores da mega-thread já passam sozinhas (e por muito) do meu orçamento, risos. Cavucando, achei duas opções que me parecem pelo menos razoáveis pro meu propósito (algo de entrada, mas que não seja rasgar dinheiro e que entregue bons resultados): um manual, [o M3 pro](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/icoffee-moedor-cafe-manual-coffee-grinder-m3-pro-cafe/p/MLB26964708#polycard_client=recommendations_pdp-v2p&reco_backend=ranker_retrieval_online_vpp_v2p&reco_model=coldstart_low_exposition%2C+rk_online_v4_retsys_vpp_v2p%2C+coldstart_high_exposition&reco_client=pdp-v2p&reco_item_pos=1&reco_backend_type=low_level&reco_id=a3792cbb-81f6-4a52-a492-4ed4adb96ab2&wid=MLB5893112048&sid=recos) da iCofee, e um elétrico, [da Cadence](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B076HZQQ9X?tag=unicafe09-20&th=1#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor). Vi que a comunidade no geral prefere manuais, mas não consegui entender os benefícios nem a diferença.

Quanto à prensa, a recomendação [da Bialetti](https://www.amazon.com.br/Cafeteira-French-Press-350Ml-Bialetti/dp/B008ESHNMI?tag=unicafe09-20&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&th=1) me parece perfeita, uma marca conhecida e com um design bonitinho, mas ela é do tipo de pessoa que bebe três xícaras antes das 10 da manhã, fico preocupado da capacidade ser meio baixa. Considerei essa em inox [da Secura](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B00JE36GLQ?tag=unicafe09-20&th=1#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor) (me parece mais resistente) e essa [da Tramontina](https://www.tramontina.com.br/cafeteira-francesa-tramontina-em-vidro-e-polipropileno-preto-1-l/61767600.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq4uJXTBSwYwAb6XETG74vwQHyYzpPf45Pz8kGr68tyt6d99uH0) principalmente pela capacidade, mas confesso que não consegui nem entender que critérios poderia usar pra avaliar a qualidade de uma prensa dessas.

I've had near-constant nausea for about 4 months, since i stopped taking quetiapine, but it's gone on for long enough that my GP thinks it's unrelated. I've always been a fairly nauseous person anyway, but recently it's much more severe.

Symptoms include:

* Nausea (especially mornings/after eating), sometimes with dry heaving/vomiting.
* Tight feeling in my stomach
* Loss of appetite
* Unintentional weight loss - I've not weighed myself, but I've lost about 15 cm on my waist measurement.
* Poor sleep (waking up due to nausea)
* Low mood/irritability (again, due to nausea)
* Slightly loose stool (Bristol 5)

My GP put me on omeprazole for a month to rule out gastritis/acid reflux, and it's had no effect. I've also had some blood, urine, and stool tests which are all normal. I'll put the results in the comments.

I've started keeping a food and symptom diary. I'm typically nauseous most days and after most meals. However, I have had some symptom free days. I've also had some very bad days, and then i gradually return to my 'normal' level of nausea over about 3-4 days.

It's been hard to determine if that's related to what I've eaten, but this is what I've found so far:

|'Suspect' foods|'Safe' foods|
|:-|:-|
|Cheese toastie, cheese and onion pie, croissant, crackers, lasagne, fried food with batter (e.g. tempura, fish & chips)|sushi, seafood, chicken, chocolate milk, rice, peanut butter, coffee with milk, eggs|

This makes me think that wheat is the problem, but I don't think my symptoms match that of coeliac disease or allergies? Happy to be told I'm wrong!

I guess my question is - could it be a food intolerance, particularly coeliac? Is it likely something else? Should I ask my GP for any particular tests?",1,1762783375.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I go to bed at like 8 pm (I'm always super tired by then). From like 9pm-2am I wake up pretty much every hour to pee. I usually fall asleep again every time \*until\* 2am. Then I just lay there awake until a slightly more acceptable time to get out of bed. I typically drink a coffee or two in the morning and another one at around 2pm. But this is for sure not a caffeine problem, I've been drinking coffee daily for the past 10 years (I'm 24). But I always used to be a perfect sleeper.

1otef68,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftmaps/comments/1otef68/searching_aim_of_life/,searching aim of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1762783004.0,minecraftmaps,0,1.0,False

1otecna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1otecna/how_to_stop_feeling_disappointed_in_my_husband/,How to stop feeling disappointed in my husband,"I'm in a cycle with my marriage where I constantly feel let down by my husband and in turn, he feels constantly criticized, and I think it's slowly killing our relationship. 

Our issues stem from the fact that I am a very proactive person and he is a reactive person. I anticipate issues and take steps to nip them in the bud. He leaves everything until it can't wait anymore. 

This dynamic comes out in the way we care for our home, parent, and how we disagree. A lot of my dissatisfaction comes from him lagging on housework or things that I view as basic courtesy. For example, if you use the last diaper, refill the diaper caddy. Or, if there are no clean dishes left, start the full dishwasher. Or, if you spill coffee grounds on the counter, wipe them up! These things seem obvious to me, but he just does not register them. 

We have two small children and, before they came along I wasn't really bothered by this dynamic. But now, everyone is stretched too thin and I'm sick of picking up the slack. 

He took one of our children on a long weekend away this weekend, and I was struck by how much more calm I felt without him there. There was no one for me to clean up after, no one for me to be disappointed by when they didn't do xyz. I hate that I feel this way. 

How do we get out of this cycle? I am not interested in divorce, but rather looking to see if anyone has had success turning this dynamic around in their relationship. I am currently looking for a couples therapist. ",4,1762782834.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

1otebj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1otebj8/extremely_vivid_dream/,Extremely vivid dream,"A few years ago I had an incredibly vivid dream where I was a sheriff's deputy way up in rural Maine. Now, in the dream, I was a widower who worked the night shift just to escape everything and kind of wallow down in my loneliness. I have a near collision with a moose out there in the boonies and when this happens, I notice a bunch of lights off in the distant woods and a road that suddenly appeared. I take the road through the deep woods and come out into a town that didn't exist. It's a town that is quaint and dreamlike and quite peaceful. I find myself wanting to stay, especially when I realize that there's a house on a small hill that I somehow KNOW is mine. In the yard is my old dog who had died some years before and in the doorway is my wife. I then realize that there's a sheriff's office with my name on the window. I'm the sheriff of this place that doesn't exist. The town's name is Caelum, a word I'd never heard before and the word that was on my lips when I woke up. I immediately grabbed a cup of coffee and sat on the couch to write down the dream before I could forget and began to really wonder about that word.

1oteb67,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1oteb67/do_you_know_what_i_actually_want/,Do you know what I actually Want?,"B 

You asked me this during our last conversation. 

*do you know what i actually want?* 

I thought I did. You were pretty clear about it, too. I even agreed to it! We had a long discussion about it, we crossed our T's and dotted our I's. We were on the same page and in sync, and I was on board. 

Then you changed your mind. You wanted to explore our connection. You wanted to go deeper. I hesitated because it's not what we discussed, and I didn't feel *safe enough* to open up because your circumstances didn't allow me to. I told you I was very open to it, but only after your situation was figured out but not before then. 

That was a boundary, a safe one, mind you in order to protect myself from getting hurt. 

Then you wanted to say goodbye

Then we reconnected again. We chatted, and your mind was all over the place. You were in. You were out. You wanted to reconnect physically and even made plans to surprise me with it. But you changed your mind. You wanted to stay friends, you wanted to explore more, you wanted to say goodbye. 

We reconnected one last time. This time, you seemed dejected, depressed. Like you've all but given up. The whole impression and vibe i got from you is you asking yourself *what's the point?*. I tried to open up to you to bring out that person I first met. Because for those brief moments, you seemed so happy, joyful, excited. I wanted to open the door for you to have an *escape* as we discussed during our first chats. Not just physically, but a place, and a person you can come to to just be you. Do you need a shower? Do you need  a nap? Need a coffee? Do you need somewhere to just switch off? Do you need a physical release? A meal? A chat? Or a friend, I was here. 

But again, no. You tried, and I could tell it was forced. You tried so hard, but you've all but given up. Mid sentence, mid conversation you went back to *guess I need to just say goodbye. Im sorry. My brain always circles back to this* 

That was frustrating. I told you to be absolutely sure that's what you wanted. Because I was not going to reach out a 3rd time. You know what they say: 

*Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results*

You asked me: *do you know what I even want?* 

No, how could I. You changed your mind what felt like every few minutes. 

Im not a psychic either. 

Here's a question for you: 

Do *you* know what *I* want? 

The person I first met. She was so open, so exciting, and so excited. She was very forward, confident, sensual, and enthusiastic. She was intelligent, a great conversationalist, a wonderful human being, and an absolute pleasure to get to know. She brought a smile on my face when my notifications would go off, and she made me feel something i hadn't felt in 20 years. 

She was the closest thing to the exact person, connection, and dynamic i have been searching for for that long. 

So you can see now? The truth? Why i had to hold back and protect myself until you figured out your circumstances. 

Im here 2 years later, still thinking about that evening and the brief period of time we shared. That obviously means you left one hell of an impression. 

Both are good and bad. 

Im grateful for that evening and for the good. 

Im left frustrated and confused by the rest. 

The last thing I said to you was for you to be absolutely certain that saying goodbye was what you really wanted because I would not reach out again. 

You typed for a long time, i saw that you sent me a long message. Then you immediately blocked me after you hit send. The chat disappeared as soon as you blocked me. 

So, i got my answer. But I never got to read what you said. Im guessing it was a string of expletives 

But then again, I guess I'll never know. 

I aknowledge that my role in this is all the mentions of compatability. That scared you off. I also aknowledge that my own thoughts that you were somehow frightened of me caused my internal defensive walls to be up at 100%. It took me a long time to realize that you were not frightened of me at all. But rather it was your circumstances. You haven't felt safe in a very long time, and that reflects on how you interact with others. I wish I knew then what I know now because I would have handled things much differently. 

It took me a long time to realize what you were looking for as well. 

*safety* rather than an *escape* 

You didn't feel safe in your own home, and your circumstances were rough. 

I dont know what the circumstances are now. I hope they've changed, and I hope they've gotten better. I have no way to reach out, nor do i intend to, hence, why im writing here into the ether. Nor do I have any way to know about your circumstances or if you are safe. it's not my business to know anyway. Not anymore

Take good care of yourself, whether you believe it or not. I worry about you and your situation. I want you to be safe. Im powerless to do anything, and I feel like my presence in your life would serve as a catalyst to only make things worse. If you were frightened of me, I believe that is the reason why. 

Both of us didn't feel safe enough to continue. Different circumstances with the same outcome. 

From someone who cares.

1otea6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1otea6d/does_anyone_know_the_title_and_have_free_link_of/,Does anyone know the title and have free link of this?,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

With a large database it was nice to go make coffee during a 2 week break without matches and come back to all the training being over, or to have netflix on my second monitor, only needing to fully focus on the game when important things happened (Transfers, matches, injuries).

However as it is now, I can only get the 2 second version to work (I prefer 5 so that if I notice something during the timer I can jump in and make a quick fix) but the slow loading times make it progress during a time I can't even click the screen sometimes. 

Beyond that, it only seems to work in between each match. As soon as my team is finished playing, it's as if the setting forgot how to work unless I set it to another time and then on 2 seconds again. 

ALSO in previous games it never showed you the timer until it was needed, but even during my matches there is a small pink box with ""0:02"" next to the other options as if it thinks it could continue anything in the next few seconds.

I'm glad I didn't buy this game and just have it through Xbox gamepass, because this has completely taken me out of the routine that I enjoy with this series.",2,1762782645.0,footballmanagergames,3,1.0,False

She orders the same thing every day: large oat milk latte, extra hot. Comes in around 9am, always on her phone, never says please or thank you.

Last Tuesday she complained her coffee was ""too hot"" and demanded a refund. I explained she literally orders it extra hot. She said I was being argumentative and making excuses. Insisted on speaking to my manager.

Manager gave her a refund to avoid a scene. Woman left smirking.

Next morning, same time, same order. ""Large oat milk latte, extra hot.""

I made it exactly to standard temperature. Not extra hot. Just regular hot, which cools down faster.

She didn't check it in the shop. Walked out talking on her phone like always.

She came back twenty minutes later absolutely fuming. Coffee was ""lukewarm"" and ""undrinkable."" Demanded another refund.

I very politely explained that after yesterday's complaint about it being too hot, I made it to standard temperature today to ensure it wouldn't burn her. Can't win either way, apparently.

She demanded I remake it extra hot like she ordered. I said I'd be happy to, but couldn't offer a refund since the first one was made to standard temperature, which is what we serve unless otherwise specified, and she did receive the oat milk latte she paid for.

Manager backed me up this time. No refund.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Eagles vs. Packers: A Monday Night Snowplow Showdown**  
The Green Bay Packers (5-2-1) and Philadelphia Eagles (6-2) clash in Week 10 at Lambeau Field, where the temperature might be colder than the Eagles’ chances of leaving with a win. Let’s parse the odds, digest the (lack of) news, and serve up a parlay so bold, it’ll make the Manning brothers question their life choices.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves

The Packers are slight favorites at decimal odds of **1.87** (implied probability: **53.5%**), while the Eagles hover at **1.95** (**51.3%**). The spread? Green Bay -1.5 (-1.0 at some books), and the total is locked at **45.5 points** (even money). These numbers scream “textbook grind,” but let’s break it down:

* **Home-field advantage**: Lambeau is a fortress, where the wind chill could freeze a quarterback’s confidence. The Packers’ 5-2-1 record includes a tie—because even Green Bay can’t decide if it’s winning or not.
* **Eagles’ consistency**: Philly’s 6-2 mark is solid, but their road trips often feel like a cross-country flight with a crying baby: stressful and unlikely to end well.
* **Total**: 45.5 is a cozy little number. Both teams score, but this line suggests a “let’s trade field goals and call it a night” vibe.

---

### Digest the News: Where’s My Ice?

The article offers no injury reports, but let’s fill in the blanks with *creative speculation*:

* **Eagles**: Jalen Hurts is presumably healthy, though whispers suggest he’s been seen “studying the playbook” (code for arguing with his coffee machine). The defense? A well-oiled machine—or so they thought, until they realized their “shutdown” unit leaks more than a sieve at a bakery.
* **Packers**: Aaron Rodgers is back from his “brief retirement” (i.e., a two-week vacation in the Maldives). The offense? A snowplow in July: unstoppable if you ignore the chaos it leaves in its wake. The defense? A group of overconfident squirrels who think they can out-nut a bear.

1ote60k,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1ote60k/does_anyone_know_the_title_and_have_free_link_of/,Does anyone know the title and have free link of this?,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

I’m 43, amicably divorced after 22 years of marriage to my high school boyfriend. And tomorrow, I’m going on my first ever date with a woman.

We matched on Bumble. She’s 39, gorgeous, lives in my town, and we’re meeting for coffee. I’m equal parts curious and excited to finally experience what it’s like to meet someone in a space where queerness and connection are both allowed to breathe. I keep wondering what my body will feel… will there be a spark? Will it just feel friendly? Either way, I’m proud of myself for showing up. It’s taken me two years to work up the courage to do this.

I was open in my profile that I’m a “divorced late bloomer, unfolding into my queerness.” I’ve done a lot of inner work over the past decade, and I truly feel ready to be my authentic self, not performing to be liked, just open to genuine connection. Still, I’m nervous about one thing: being asked about my past. It makes me cringe a little to admit this will be my first queer date, even though I know honesty matters. I don’t want her to think I’m experimenting or that there’s pressure. I just want to connect, learn, and hopefully build community along the way.

So, to my fellow late bloomers:
✨ What was your first queer date like?
✨ Did you feel awkward being “new” to it?
✨ What do you wish someone had told you before that first step?

Thanks for being a space where people like me can share these moments. This community has meant a lot as I’ve slowly, finally, found the courage.",5,1762782300.0,latebloomerlesbians,1,1.0,False
1ote517,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1ote517/does_anyone_have_a_free_link_of_this_one/,Does anyone have a free link of this one?,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

Most people think the hardest part of the job is the moment itself — the scene, the blood, the shock, the grief of the family.

But that’s not the part that stays.

What stays is the moment when you go home afterward.  
When you stand in the doorway and realize you have to switch your face back to “normal.”  
When someone asks how your day was and you say, “Fine.”

There is a silence that comes after death.  
Not the silence at the scene, but the silence inside your chest, days later, when you’re trying to drink coffee or fold laundry or talk about something small.

That silence changes you.

I’ve been trying to write about that. Not to “explain” it, because I’m not sure I can.  
But to **name** it.  
To give shape to something that feels invisible.

I don’t know if anyone else has lived this.  
But if you have — the silence after the scene — you know exactly what I mean.

If someone wants, I can share a small part of what I’ve been writing.

1ote2o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1ote2o3/does_anyone_have_a_free_link_of_this_one/,Does anyone have a free link of this one?,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

I’m a huge fan of Blue Tokai’s Vietnamese Iced Coffee. I saw some hate against it but please don’t burn me at the altar for liking it, I’m not a coffee aficionado. I come in peace and I fully respect your decision to like whichever coffee you do. 

Now for my dilemma: I would really like to replicate BT’s Vietnamese iced coffee at home. After reading a lot of posts here, I found out that Blue Tokai uses Dhak Blend for their coffee. Is this true? 

I can see Dhak blend on their website but I was quite surprised to see so many grind options - I don’t know what most of these are and I don’t have any equipment for these except the basic South Indian filter. I saw in a post here that BT uses a cold brew concentrate, is that true or have you replicated it any other way? (if there’s a BT Barista on here, pls help me out?) I want to understand which grind to buy to replicate the taste at home? I’m okay to spend some money (nothing super expensive but under 1.5K is good) buying equipment if I can replicate it. 

Thank you so much! 

TLDR: Please help me understand which blend + grind thingy to buy to replicate Blue Tokai’s Vietnamese Iced Coffee at home? ",1,1762782104.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

I've met a lot of Canadians in my life, and I can only think of a single one of 'em – a weirdo ping-pong playing savant who broke the window out of our garage door and about who I'll write about one day if I haven't already – who gives much of a crap what the Royal Family does, officially or otherwise. And I can't think of a single player on the Blue Jays, almost all of whom are non-Canadian – who could possibly care. Indeed, I suspect that this is one of those ""controversies"" for which someone was ""blasted on social media"" but which really only consisted of a dozen weirdoes whose complaints were massively amplified by agenda-driven shit-stirrers to make it seem like an uproar.

Whatever. Next year Harry should go to a Kansas City Royals game, fully-decked out in the home team's gear. That'd keep some tabloid writers up late. And if called on it, Harry could issue a statement complaining about being damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.

1ote1ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1ote1ne/title_and_free_link_pls/,Title and free link pls,"This year marked the fifth anniversary of my secret relationship with my boss.

The man everyone at the company called Mr. Scott—the calm, commanding head of our division—had recently become the subject of gossip.

Apparently, he was seeing someone new.

But the woman in those rumors wasn’t me.

Everyone thought my bitterness toward his rumored “girlfriend” stemmed from an unfair year-end bonus allocation.

They didn’t know that I’d already made my decision. I had packed my bags, printed my resignation letter, and booked a one-way ticket home for Christmas.

After I handed in my letter and walked out of the office, I also walked out of the five-year relationship that had never seen daylight.

From now on, when people ask when I’ll be back, I’ll simply say there’s no return date. He’ll go his way to Manhattan, and I’ll go mine—to Boston.

“Attention passengers, Express Train G3453 is now boarding. Passengers holding tickets for Train G3453, please proceed to Gate 16, Platform 17.”

The red “Expected Delay 15 Minutes” on the board blinked once, turning green.

Commuters immediately surged forward, dragging luggage, rushing through the gate.

I followed along with the crowd, barely needing to walk on my own.

The station was a blur of motion and noise, thick with perfume, coffee, and the warmth of too many bodies.

As I queued for boarding, I took one last look at this city’s central station—where I’d spent six Christmas Eves rushing home over the past six years.

Yesterday morning, I’d still believed I’d return after the holidays.

After all, Ethan Scott was here.

“Director Summers,” General Manager Quinn had said apologetically, “this was all Mr. Scott’s decision…”

“What exactly did he say?” I asked, gripping my year-end bonus slip.

The company was buzzing with holiday excitement—the bonus distribution was the last celebration before break.

But mine was less than a tenth of previous years’.

My junior, whom I’d personally recommended for hire, had just cheerfully told me she’d received far more than expected.

The extra amount she’d received matched precisely what I’d lost.

By company policy, bonuses were tied to major project performance.

Since September, I’d led the Kenton Tech Park Project, working day and night.

My junior, Lila Warren, had barely participated—her only contribution was a presentation I had written and rehearsed for her.

When I asked about it, General Manager Quinn sighed.

“Mr. Scott said Lila is an excellent new hire and deserves encouragement through her bonus.”

I stood there, expressionless, holding that piece of paper.

Mr. Scott—Ethan Scott—was my boyfriend of five years.

The wind on the platform sliced through my coat, sweeping away the warmth of the waiting hall.

I tightened my scarf, breath misting in the cold air.

The train wasn’t in sight yet. I found my carriage line and began deleting photos from my phone.

For five years our relationship had been hidden.

Ethan said office romances violated company policy.

Whenever I’d asked for a picture together, he’d frown.

“We can take them,” he’d say, “but don’t post them anywhere.”

He was so cautious that everyone thought he barely tolerated me.

So when he diverted my year-end bonus, no one questioned it.

I tried calling him. He hung up immediately.

A message arrived seconds later:

“Busy.”

I wasn’t surprised. In five years, he’d almost never answered my calls at work.

But that day I didn’t call for love—I called for answers.

Taking the elevator to the top floor, I walked down the glass corridor.

Behind a wall of tropical plants, Ethan stood beside Lila Warren, pointing at her computer screen.

She leaned close, her scarf brushing his collar.

He was explaining a proposal—patiently, gently.

The same man who used to frown at me and say, “I’m really busy. I don’t have time to teach basic things.”

When I’d made mistakes before, he’d said, “The more painful the lesson, the deeper it sticks.”

I’d believed him. Pain meant growth.

But now, watching him talk softly to Lila, I finally understood: he just hadn’t wanted to.

On his desk sat a take-out breakfast—the kind I used to deliver every morning.

He never liked me coming straight to his office, so I used to bribe the cafeteria lady to drop it off for me.

Sometimes, when he skipped meals, I’d bring it myself.

He’d sigh.

“Your direct supervisor is Daniel Quinn. Don’t you think it’s odd that you keep coming to me?”

Now I heard Lila’s laugh.

“This smells amazing! Is it okay if I have it?”

“Go ahead,” Ethan said without looking up.

She smiled. “You’re the best, Mr. Scott.”

The thick leaves hid me completely.

There was no point asking about the bonus anymore.

I turned away and took the elevator down.

Moments after I reached my desk, everything went black.

A power failure—heavy rain had knocked out the grid.

The company sent an emergency notice: work from home.

People laughed, grabbed umbrellas, and left in groups.

Through the glass doors, I saw Ethan holding his umbrella over Lila, walking her to his car.

A considerate boss indeed.

Rain pooled around my ankles by the time I got home.

When my phone rang, I almost didn’t answer.

“Claire,” he said, “I figured you had an umbrella. You’re home safe, right?”

In the background, I heard Lila’s voice:

“Mr. Scott, would you like some ginger tea?”

“I added extra cheese to this morning’s sandwich,” I said softly. “Was it good?”

He hesitated.

“Yeah… it was good.”

I hung up.

Then I threw away all the groceries I’d bought for him—

paused—

and picked them out again.

The neighborhood cat meowed outside.

“At least someone’s hungry,” I whispered, smiling faintly.

While boiling water, I saw Lila’s social-media post:

Two hands holding mugs of ginger tea.

“Feels so good to have someone who cares.”

I liked the post.

An urgent whistle echoed across the platform.

Announcements blared behind me as the train doors opened.

I boarded, dragging my suitcase down the narrow aisle.

For a second, I thought I heard someone call my name from behind—

maybe it was for me, maybe it wasn’t.

I had no interest in turning around.

The first stop after leaving New Haven Central was Halden Station. A young couple boarded the train. I had seat B; they had A and C.

The girl stamped her foot, annoyed. “Seriously, Liam, how did you buy tickets like this?”

The boy smiled apologetically. “It was packed! At least we’re in the same row.”

Then he turned to me with a hopeful grin. “Would you mind switching seats so we can sit together?”

The girl quickly pulled out a bag of snacks and offered them as if to bribe me.

Looking at their clasped hands and the excitement in their eyes, I smiled.

“Of course not,” I said, standing up.

“Thank you!” The boy helped the girl sit by the window, then stowed their luggage overhead.

“Quick, post it!” she said, eyes gleaming. “We’re heading home for Christmas—first trip as a couple!”

Their laughter was bright, contagious.

I smiled faintly and looked down at my phone—making sure all my photos were deleted.

Our story had also begun on a winter journey, five years ago.

That was my first time leading a solo bid presentation, in Halden City. The responsibility was enormous, and I was terrified of failing.

And fail I did.

That day, a blizzard paralyzed the city—subway closed, taxis nowhere in sight.

I realized I’d never make it in time for the bid.

In panic, I called General Manager Quinn. He cursed before sighing and sending me a contact.

“Mr. Scott’s also in Halden. Have him pick you up. And next time, don’t volunteer for this again!”

My hands shook as I dialed the number.

When he heard my tearful voice explaining the situation, Ethan’s tone softened immediately.

“Don’t panic. Stay where you are. I’m on my way.”

He navigated the snow-covered streets like a man who’d done this a hundred times, glancing at the GPS, avoiding closed roads.

His calm voice steadied my breathing.

“We’ll make it. Just remember—always leave buffer time for everything.”

And we did make it. Barely.

When I came downstairs after submitting the bid, sweat drenched my shirt under my down coat.

Ethan was leaning against his car, holding two cups of coffee.

“What’s your name?” he asked with a faint smile.

That night, I posted a private story visible only to him:

“Met a kind god on a snowy day.”

He liked it within a minute.

I blinked back to the present as the train sped through the night.

A notification flashed across my phone—Lila’s latest post had vanished.

Moments later, Ethan’s name appeared on my screen.

“I’m on my way home,” he said.

“Drive carefully,” I replied.

“You too. Stay warm,” he murmured before hanging up.

Back then, I’d smiled like an idiot at messages like that.

This time, I felt nothing.

“Ethan,” I had asked him once, “can I tell my parents about us this Christmas?”

He’d gone silent before saying,

“No. They’ll only pressure you to get married. Let’s not complicate things.”

Every year since turning twenty-five, my parents’ calls about marriage had multiplied.

I’d deflected every one of them—with the unspoken faith that I already had someone worth waiting for.

I had believed him when he said, “Not yet.”

And I’d kept believing for five years.

The train slowed into Halden Station again—this time for the next stop.

The young couple packed up their things, holding hands as they laughed.

When the broadcast chimed, they stood up together and disappeared down the aisle.

The young couple got off.

The next stop was Yorkhaven Station. A middle-aged couple boarded and sat beside me—the husband lugging all the suitcases while the wife carried an armful of food containers.

I started to stand to offer my seat, but she stopped me with a smile.

“Don’t bother, sweetheart. It’s the only time I can keep him from nagging me.”

The man huffed. “All because I couldn’t find your dad’s favorite mulled wine at the last station, and you won’t stop complaining!”

I hid a grin and shifted to seat A so they could sit together.

They thanked me, still bickering affectionately as they settled in.

The aroma of spiced ginger wine filled the carriage.

Yorkhaven’s specialty, famous for its warmth.

My connection with Ethan was tied to a bottle of wine like that.

Back then I had already become a full-time employee under Daniel Quinn’s supervision.

He and Ethan were in Yorkhaven to finalize a contract signing.

“Claire,” Daniel told me, “buy a few bottles of the local ginger wine for Mr. Grant’s team. Use the petty-cash card.”

That was the real reason he’d brought me along.

I ran the errand gladly—until I came back and saw chaos outside the hotel.

A man on a motorcycle had just snatched the document bag from Ethan’s secretary.

“Call the police!” Daniel shouted. “The company seal’s inside!”

Rounding the corner with the wine, I came face-to-face with the thief.

Without thinking, I lunged.

The impact sent us both sprawling onto the icy pavement.

Everything went dark.

When I woke up in the hospital, Daniel pressed his hands together.

“Good thing he’d slowed down—another few miles per hour and you’d be gone!”

He left to handle things at the station, and Ethan stayed behind.

He pulled a chair close, expression unreadable.

“How could you be so reckless?” he said quietly. “If the seal was lost, we could’ve reported it and re-issued.”

“But it would’ve ruined the signing,” I murmured. “You helped me last time. I wanted to return the favor.”

He didn’t reply right away—just reached out and held my hand.

When I looked up, he was watching me.

“My name’s Ethan Scott,” he said softly.

After I was discharged, the driver arranged to pick me up—but somehow Ethan showed up instead.

He took me to the lake at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the water.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said, his voice low. “If that foolish, fearless girl is willing to fall into my arms again, I’ll never let her go.”

The world glowed in amber tones, and when he kissed my forehead, everything felt weightless.

Now, years later, that memory felt like someone else’s life.

He’d once looked at my bruises with heartbreak; now he looked at my fever patch with mild annoyance.

“Feeling better?” he asked that morning, setting down a bag of soup.

“Depends,” I said flatly.

“I didn’t see breakfast on your desk today. I figured something was wrong.”

I almost laughed. “You make it sound like I’m a broken coffee machine.”

He frowned. “You’re sick and still working?”

“Nothing new,” I said, closing my laptop. “You’ve already overstayed your three-minute check-in quota, Mr. Scott.”

I stood to leave, but he caught my wrist.

“Go home and rest.”

A boyfriend’s concern, in a boss’s tone.

I shook him off.

As I stepped out, I heard Lila’s voice from the next office, sweet and pleading.

“Mr. Scott, can you look at my proposal?”

When I returned later, the project group chat had exploded.

Daniel had just added Ethan. His message was brief:

“Project is entering final stage. Full responsibility now transferred to Lila Warren.”

The office buzzed with whispers.

Everyone knew Ethan didn’t like me, but this—this was deliberate humiliation.

I typed one word:

“Acknowledged.”

And that was that.

I handed Lila the files she needed, submitted a sick-leave request—approved instantly—and left my resignation letter on my desk.

The company where I’d spent six years—the grave of my love—was behind me now.

Across the aisle, the middle-aged woman chuckled, nudging her husband.

“Tell me, could you ever catch up to a high-speed train by car?”

He laughed. “Three hundred miles an hour—what, you think I’m driving a rocket?”

Right. Once you’re drifting further apart, how could you possibly catch up?

The third stop was Elden Station. An elderly couple boarded slowly, supporting each other as they made their way down the aisle.

Seeing the man’s cane, I automatically slid to the window seat.

“Thank you, dear,” said the woman kindly. “My husband’s legs aren’t what they used to be, so I like to sit beside him.”

The man chuckled. “And she still complains the train’s too crowded every year!”

“You’re the one who insisted we see the snow,” she shot back. “Now we almost didn’t get tickets home!”

He smiled. “We can only see the snow so many more times, love.”

I smiled faintly, looking out at the white landscape.

I’d only been to Elden once before.

That one trip was also my last with Ethan.

His promotion was about to be announced, and I was genuinely proud of him.

He’d always been ambitious, driven—his success felt inevitable.

We spent that winter weekend in Elden’s famous snow forest, building a snowman with gloved hands, laughing as flakes caught in our hair.

“If the owner rates it over eighty points, the meal’s free,” Ethan had said.

We’d been given a twenty.

The owner said our snowman “barely looked human.”

We laughed until we fell into the snow, breathless, kissing in the cold.

My fingers had gone numb, but my heart was full.

That winter had felt like a scene in a snow globe—sealed, perfect, untouchable.

Later that night, over warm sake in a quiet izakaya, Ethan looked at me seriously.

“We need to be more careful,” he said.

“Haven’t we been?” I smiled.

“More discreet,” he clarified.

So I agreed—naively believing it was a necessary precaution, not the start of our decline.

It wasn’t that I never thought about quitting the job.

But it was the dream company, the position I’d fought to earn.

And more than that, I wanted to see him every day—even if only from a distance.

Compared to the heartbreaks that followed, the fever I had today was nothing.

I’d stayed up finishing a project handover before my resignation, but exhaustion hit hard.

I was half-asleep on the sofa when I heard the door open.

Ethan stepped in, setting down bags of soup and porridge.

He still had a key.

He looked around. “Why’s the place half empty?”

“New year cleaning,” I murmured.

He unpacked the food in silence. When he looked up, he froze.

“Where are our photos?”

I used to keep our Polaroids all over the apartment—on the coffee table, bookshelf, kitchen counter.

Little reminders of something private and real.

“Oh,” I said lightly. “Some colleagues visited recently. I put them away.”

He said nothing, just pressed a cool hand to my forehead, checking my temperature.

“Still a bit warm,” he murmured, replacing my fever patch.

“I’ll be fine,” I said. “It’s just a cold.”

He paused. “I meant the photos.”

Then, quietly, “Eat something first.”

I sat up and looked at the spread of soup and congee before me, but my stomach turned.

“Not hungry?” he asked gently. “At least have some water.”

I turned away—and his phone rang.

Lila’s voice came through, high and nervous.

“Mr. Scott, I can’t find the final acceptance form for the Tech Park project—what should I do?”

He grabbed his coat. “Hold on, I’m coming.”

Then, glancing at me: “Is this how you left things?”

He didn’t wait for an answer. The door shut behind him with a thud.

The missing file?

It was labeled and indexed in the handover folder I’d given her.

She just hadn’t bothered to read it.

But this was her chance to call him—her chance to be saved.

A few minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Found it. You wrote it clearly. Then: a money transfer notification. The amount—exactly what he’d taken from my bonus.

I clicked return.

He sent an emoji.

“Rest up. I’m heading into a meeting.”

Every Friday night, he had a three-hour video call with headquarters.

He wouldn’t be checking his phone.

So I sent one last message:

“Let’s break up.”

Then I blocked him.

“I saw a video once,” the old man beside me said with a smile. “It said watching snow together means you’ll grow old together.”

The woman rolled her eyes. “Our hair’s been white for years, you romantic fool.”

In the Elden snow, Ethan had once turned to me and said the same words—

“Claire, we’ll grow old together.”

I smiled faintly at the window, watching the snow fall.

We won’t anymore.

The fourth stop was Ravenport Central, where I was supposed to change trains. Two more stops, and I’d be home.

But the delay from New Haven finally caught up here—the schedule board blinked red: “Expected Delay: 65 Minutes Due to Heavy Snow.”

Since I no longer had a connection to catch, I wasn’t in a hurry. I found a small café inside the station concourse and ordered a hazelnut latte to pass the time.

Ravenport’s downtown branch of Kensington Group was just across the street. Ethan and I used to come here often for meetings, always with six or seven people in two cars—no one ever suspected a thing.

Back then, under Daniel Quinn’s supervision, I was beginning to stand out. Ethan’s standards were ruthless, and my colleagues often joked that I should learn how to sweeten the boss up a little.

So one day, before a meeting, I brought him coffee.

“Mr. Scott, your coffee,” I said with a straight face.

He glanced up. “Is it the hazelnut latte?”

“Yes,” I replied.

Daniel chuckled. “Oh? Trading your Americano for something sweeter today, Ethan?”

Ethan’s gaze lingered on the label—hazelnut—before he nodded at me. “Thank you.”

It was the first time I’d ever seen him soften at work. That moment became our secret—a quiet intimacy hidden beneath the formality.

From then on, whenever we came to Raventport, I brought him the same drink. It was our unspoken ritual.

So later, when I saw him accept the same latte from Lila, I froze.

“Too sweet,” he said, pushing it away. “Next time, just make it an Americano.”

“I thought Director Quinn liked it this way,” she said brightly. “He told me to add two sugars!”

“Perfect,” I said lightly. “Then I’ll drink both.”

He didn’t even look at me. I finished them both anyway—so sweet it almost hurt.

What changed, Ethan—the coffee, or the person who brought it?

I took another sip now, the bitterness grounding me. My phone buzzed—messages from Daniel.

“You resigned?! I just went to your office—you were gone!” “Ethan saw your letter and tore it up. He’s furious.” “Come back after the holidays. We’ll fix this.”

I blocked him.

Then my building manager called. “Miss, your partner was here earlier,” she said carefully. “He renewed your lease, said you’d be coming back.”

“Did he now?”

“Yes, but he also… went through your things. Looked like he was searching for something.”

My pulse skipped. “What exactly?”

“He didn’t say. But after searching every cabinet, he left in a hurry. He looked… shaken.”

“Thank you,” I said, ending the call.

The call log showed 99+ blocked attempts. I didn’t bother to check who they were from.

I sat quietly, watching the snow fall beyond the fogged glass. Travelers hurried by with suitcases, boots squeaking against the marble floor. The smell of coffee and wet wool filled the air.

When the time felt right, I stood up to leave.

As I passed the counter, the barista greeted a new customer.

“Good afternoon, sir. What can I get for you?”

And then—

“Hazelnut latte.”

A familiar voice cut through the noise of the café.

1otdx70,https://i.redd.it/155hplwqmf0g1.jpeg,I hope to release this tome of escapades and endeavors sometime next year...,"Good morning! I waited a long time to become a full-time writer. It’s been my aspiration since I was small enough to be told to “go outside and play” instead of scribbling stories in a notebook. Of course, except for the lucky few whose names become household words, writing isn’t exactly lucrative—especially in the beginning.

Yes, I did make a decent living for a while writing articles and, for a time, Death Notices, but that wasn’t what I truly wanted to do. The stories that begged—no, nagged—to be written had to be told in my so-called spare time. And so they were, up until recently.

Now that life has finally allowed me to indulge in my writing habit full-time, I’m still writing two articles a day (one for my Author Page, another for my Patreon and Substack pages), but I’m also diving into a new book. This one is quite a departure from my prehistoric fiction—it’s about my own life, in all its unusual, occasionally adventurous, and sometimes downright chaotic glory. With luck (and a bit of divine intervention from the coffee gods), I hope to release this tome of escapades and endeavors sometime next year.

Meanwhile, I happily type away the hours. It feels wonderful to be back in the rhythm of storytelling. After finishing my eight-volume Dreamer Books: An Ice Age Saga series, there was a strange emptiness in my life. Now, my favorite “composing music” is back on, and my tapping fingers fly over the keyboard once more to Ralph Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis or Dougie MacLean’s Promontory (The Gael). Happy sigh. 

The music plays, the stories unfold, and I find myself once more lost—and found—on the page. It’s nice to know that even after all these years, writing still feels like coming home.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1762781735.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False
1otdwsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1otdwsq/24yo_twiceexceptional_with_chinese_parents_and/,"24yo twice-exceptional with Chinese parents and still not enrolled in a college, how do I convince my study coach that I need a degree and don't deserve to be isolated?","Typically I get way too carried away when writing about my life story but this time I'll try to keep things shorter. If people are interested I might post a more elaborate story tho. I feel like it's necessary for people to understand me but it's just way too long.

Last year I enrolled in a nearby college to study computer science, it's really the only thing I'm interested in. I had terrible experiences duuing middle and high school bc of things like getting pressured and misunderstood by my parents getting bullied and spending time on gaming instead of homework to surpress my depression. University would've been an option if I studied harder for maths but I always hated dealing with maths so I switched to an easier version just so I could pass my exams.

I was fed up and ashamed of my current life so I was hoping to change it by proving I could handle college so I could later live on my own and earn money without having to worry about studying anymore. Studying takes me a lot of time and effort bc I have trouble keeping myself motivated and get distracted easily, and want to spend time gaming or else I get depressed, so I can't really do much while I still need to worry about my degree. I never really enjoyed studying and going to school for multiple reasons, but I felt like this time I might actually enjoy it. The college wasn't far away from home which was amazing for someone who can barely take care of himself and barely has experience with traveling by themselves.

I know I'm horribly socially awkward but I tried hard to fit in. The open day gave me a good impression. The introduction day was awkward but I enjoyed it. On the second day already the first big group project started and I basically froze in fear then had a vitriolic reaction that just slipped out of my mouth ""Oh, I need to work together? Ugggggghhh"" I thought it was more individual based on what my mom told me (apparently this applies only to university and not to college/hbo) I barely even got used to the new environment and already I was forced to deal with annoying kids who are crass loudmouths, are only into mainstream stuff rather than the niche indie and Japanese games I'm into, and probably think badly and weirdly of me. The PTSD of my bad experiences with kids from high school to came forth.

I had a rough start but I did my best with the things that were assigned to me. However bc I sometimes didn't understand what was going on bc I had pretty much no prior experience and my autism might have made it harder to understand, I had to ask my group mates for help frequently. I also got super annoyed by kids in my class talking loudly about random BS which really distracted me. I didn't dare to address anyone about it bc I feared they'd hate me. I tried to avoid standing out or being the center of attention. When I had to design a website for some fictional company I made a butt-ugly milquetoast of a design with the only real goal I had in mind being passing the requirements. I had to ask group mates for feedback a LOT bc I did not want to get a bad grade, I needed to leave a good impression on my familty so they won't resist about the idea of the absolute failure that I am going to college. It is expensive after all and I don't wanna waste it. I feared that people would make fun of me if I were to express creativity irl, not like I'm all that creative anyway. I was also tired often but I didn't take the free coffee bc I don't like coffee.

I had a few talks with my study coach and he basically told me I should quit college bc I'm autistic and awful at working with people, and I should take a self study that's expensive and seen as lower value by employers than an actual degree. This borderline pissed me off for many reasons and I insisted I needed to continue. It felt genuinely insulting to be met with this attitude while I just got started, and with me being gifted I was convinced I could make it easily. One of these talks demotivated me so hard that I traumadumped on the rest of my group that I'm gonna be forced to work at mcDonald's if I fail here.

Things were going okay-ish and well enough until the final week before the autumn break. We only had a few moments where the entire group was together left for the week and I needed to finish something before then. I  was practically clueless on why the thing I made didn't work like it should've. The rest of my group wasn't helping me and classmates were noisy as usual. With my usual tiredness in the morning and my dad having bitched about choosing the moment to go to bed for me even though I was 23 and not tired at that time, my tolerance for frustration was low. That's when the incident happened. I had a meltdown that destroyed my future. I slammed the table and shouted ""Why isn't it working?"" If people around me had weird reactions to that I didn't notice them, I was too busy worrying about my contribution to the project. Besides, in my household these kinds of situations were somewhat normal, pretty much every member of my family, especially my father, had a low anger tolerance and wasn't afraid to express it if push came to shove. Eventually I made some progress but none of it would've mattered.

Because later that day I was kicked out of my group. The rest of the group, and my study coach, basically old me that I was asking the rest of my group too often (which they could've communicated with me earlier, so I could adjust my behavior in time, but they CHOSE not to), and other dumb reasons like I occasionally got lost in the building while I was just getting used to it. And it absolutely, completely BROKE me. It basically reinfoced the labels and stigmas put on me that I am worthless and born to fail. My ONE chance to prove the opposite was gone. I had another mental breakdown, cried, and went home with my head held down in shame where my mom scolded me and my brother made fun of me. It's completely and utterly unfair, those kids from my group were being annoying and weird to me and I have a terrible life and no friends or a loving family compared to them and I had to take the blame for everything. Life is truly unfair.

The next day my coach told me I was banned from all future group projects bc of my behavior and my panic attacks and anger attacks. This completely destroyed my ego. It was basically hard proof that I was born for failure and disppointing my parents, and that bc of my autism I will never function in society and have a normal life, and that the 4chan trolls were right. I can't even do the one thing I'm supposedly good at.

I protested multiple times over the year begging him to let me back but nothing worked. He still let me go to individual lessons but that alone isn't enough to pass the year. So I barely had anything to do even though I wanted something to do and wanted to feel genuine progress toward my future, so I basically went back to my old NEET life, frustrated about being powerless and having no hope for the future. I argued with my mother a lot about my opinion of the situation, my life, my future, and how I was treated by my parents during middle and high school, and it annoyed my brother. I hate him bc he doesn't have an ounce of pity or care for me.

I really, really, REALLY need that degree for multiple reasons:

-I need it to convince my family that I'm not a worthless sack of shit, I also want to make up for the mistakes I made in the past in middle and high school and the trouble I always caused to my family, and eventually be able to financially support them and stop being a burden to them. I don't want them to pass away with regrets. I want to fulfill my parents' wish that they raised me for when I was young before it's too late. I also want to shut up my naysayer of a brother

-I want to have a bright future and live a normal life despite having autism, I want friends or just people around me who support me and are happy I'm there, maybe even start a family

-I want to live by myself bc my parents are extremely protective of me, my father can get dangerously aggressive and my brother annoys me and I feel trapped, as well as ashamed of myself for still living with my parents at this age

-I want my future career to fit me and let me use my talents and interests, with my giftedness I should be able to get an amazing career, otherwise I will be completely unmotivated

-I want to disprove or be immune to the negative stereotypes and labels from certain people like trolls on 4chan or X

I protested to my coach multiple times but nothing worked. At one point he told me to get an ""outpatient counselor"" (This is google translated idk how to describe it), and if they told him I'm suitable for college he'll let me back in. I protested bc of the waiting times. Eventually I got one but they also just discouraged me from going to college which pissed me off, basically my coach gave me a bogus solution to distract me. They also suggested some kind of special ed for computer science to me, which I basically saw as an insult, given how godwful my previous experience with special ed is, how I'm gonna have to spend a lot of time travelling bc as usual with special eds from my experiences, they're few and far inbetween, and how it will reinforce 4chan bullies' power to humiliate me if I have to go there instead of a regular college. I am well and capable of surviving a college, IF they just give me a chance and room for improvement. So I consider it an absolute hard pass. Eventually I lost most of my hope for the future. My parents finally let me get mental help but progress is really slow and honestly barely anything changed so far.

Even in the next academic year his stance was still the same so I had to unsubscribe bc it'd be a waste of money otherwise. My coach distracted me with a boring, low-level self study course called CS50 which he initially hyped up as being useful to me and having a certificate that's enticing to employers. He also told me I could go to university next academic year but I'll need to study math again to get a certificate. I just wanted to avoid dealing with math again. Plus I dreaded all the travelling I'd need to do. I barely learned anything new from CS50 (some of it was covered in the individual subjects I was allowed to go to already) and it's not even close to being enough for a career for a gifted person. Plus it's isolated and boring. Essentially if fixes NONE of my problems. Also neither CS50 nor the study credit I earned from individual subjects will lead to exemption for subjects in university so basically that means I wasted an entire year and tons of college tuition on nothing. I'm gonna have to go through the same stuff for the third time in university, if this is true I'd rather not bother. And I have to deal with maths and travelling. This pissed me off so hard I became more determined to convince my coach again. Initially I was motivated to do CS50 and math but now I pretty much don't care anymore. I just want to go to a real college instead, and ASAP. 

At this point  I'm so tired of the ennui of being unable to work on my future or live up to the expectations that not only my parents, but society as a whole put on me, and being stuck spending over half of the day gaming and being stuck with my stupid family instead of making progress toward a bright future, sometimes I'm not even in the mood to game anymore, I just want to work on my CS degree. I seriously need to convince him but idk what to even do at this point anymore.

New my therapist wants to involve the entire family which I don't want bc I my father will not react to it well, he's the backbone of the family, he works his ass off and is the only family member who earns money and also does a lot of chores, he doesn't have time to teach us many life skills either and my mother also has to do a lot of chores while we're supposed to focus on studying, he can do something stupid like kick me out of the house, I don't wanna take the risk. My brother doesn't care about it either. They're focusing on this instead of more pressing matters like me needing a proper daily life and needing to become suitable enough for college. My coach told me he will let me back if my therapist says I'm suitable.

Sorry that this post got so damn long again but it can't be helped, it doesn't even touch upon most of my life experience before my college attempts so a lot of context is missing but trust me I tried to keep it short.",0,1762781709.0,needadvice,1,0.5,False

1otdvg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Any-Pop1838/comments/1otdvg2/faith_is_the_hunter_m306/,Faith is The Hunter M#306,"Fate Is the Hunter is a 1964 American aviation disaster drama film from 20th Century Fox, produced by Aaron Rosenberg, directed by Ralph Nelson, that stars Glenn Ford, Nancy Kwan, Suzanne Pleshette and Rod Taylor. Fate Is the Hunter also features Jane Russell (playing herself entertaining for the USO in a flashback sequence), Nehemiah Persoff, Wally Cox, and Mark Stevens. Dorothy Malone also makes an uncredited appearance. The film features an early film score by composer Jerry Goldsmith.\[3\]  
  
The film's storyline concerns the crash of a commercial airliner that killed all aboard except for one of the crew, a stewardess. Civil Aeronautics Board investigators blame pilot error, but the airline's Director of Flight Operations, himself a pilot, refuses to accept that conclusion and demands that the inquiry probe deeper into all the circumstances that contributed to the disaster. The film explores the lives of passengers and crew as well as the technical operations of aircraft, the process of investigation, and the pressures brought to bear by relentless news media and industry politics.  
  
Plot  
After the failure of both engines of his passenger jet during take-off, pilot Jack Savage (Rod Taylor) successfully belly lands the plane along what initially appears to be an open stretch of beach. However, it uncontrollably skids into a pier, exploding and killing all but one aboard, stewardess Martha Webster (Susanne Pleshette).  
  
Early in the investigation, it is discovered that one engine failed after ingesting a seagull, while the other is mysteriously mechanically sound. Focus turns to pilot-error, as Savage was seen in a bar as little as an hour before the flight. The captain's wartime buddy, airline executive Sam C. McBane (Glenn Ford), is convinced of his friend's innocence and doggedly investigates. Flashbacks deal with both Jack's past and Sam meeting him, plus others they used to know, as well as Savage's ex-fiancée and his current girlfriend Sally Fraser (Nancy Kwan). Sally introduces the idea of fate to McBane, who rejects it. During the investigation, it is revealed that the pier structure had been scheduled for demolition but the project had been delayed a few days; had the pier been dismantled on time the plane would have made a successful belly-landing. Finally McBane learns that Savage had accompanied another war buddy to the bar and had not been drinking himself. During a press conference, McBane struggles with the concept of fate and coincidence as the possible cause of the tragedy. Meanwhile, Webster, when interviewed in the hospital, insists that she witnessed fault warnings and alarm bells for both engines.  
  
Eventually, a re-enactment test flight is organized as part of the investigation. Piloted by McBane, its purpose is to exactly recreate the flight of the ill-fated airliner. Every detail both physical (the use of sandbags on seats to simulate the weight of the passengers) and sequential (chain of temporal events) is replicated. McBane tries to convince Webster to board the test flight, as she is the only remaining eyewitness to the cockpit procedures. She struggles through her post-traumatic reaction and boards the flight at the last moment. After take-off, Webster performs all of her normal duties and brings McBane coffee, just as she had done for the original flight crew. He sets the cup on a center console just as Savage had. McBane then shuts down an engine, simulating its incapacitation. He orders the craft to not be immediately trimmed, as it was not during the original event.  
  
A short time later, the second engine warning light and alarm indicates there is a serious engine fire in the remaining good engine, exactly as Webster had reported, and the radio fails. To maintain flight, McBane orders the first engine restarted. Then he notices that the coffee cup on the console spilled during the turbulence of the first engine shut-down. He opens the console's access panel and finds that coffee seeped in, short-circuiting the wiring and causing both the radio failure and a false fire warning. In reality both the original and test flights still had a fully functioning second engine, enough to prevent the crash. McBane orders the second engine restarted, disregarding its fire warning, and the plane returns safely to the airfield. Savage is therefore exonerated of pilot error as the chain of circumstances caused the accident.",1,1762781613.0,u_Any-Pop1838,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1otdu29,https://i.redd.it/v8e98jg6kf0g1.jpeg,Looking for something similar to this old Skooba laptop briefcase,"So, about 15 years ago, I bought this briefcase. Function-wise, it was perfect for me -- a little bottle holder on the side, no messenger bag flap (which annoyed me on the train), and a great bungee shoulder strap. It was great for daily commuting and air travel. Unfortunately, the zippers sucked to hell, so I abandoned it after a few months of daily use.  Skooba, I think, is long gone. 

I still use the shoulder strap for my current workbag, an REI vertical bag that's a little worse for wear. I freelance now, and I'm looking for a bag that won't embarrass me in front of clients.

Here's what happened next.","Five years ago, my life was a blur of fluorescent lights, pointless meetings, and the constant, soul-crushing 'ping' of corporate emails. I was a marketing manager, making decent money, but every Sunday night I'd feel this wave of dread wash over me. I felt like a cog in a machine I didn't even understand. My big dream? To escape. My first brilliant idea to do that was a subscription box for artisanal cheese. Sounds fancy, right? I poured about $10k of my hard-earned savings into it, picturing myself as a cool, small-batch curator. The reality was me, in my garage, surrounded by boxes of rapidly aging brie that nobody wanted, watching my bank account shrink to almost zero. It was a spectacular, gut-wrenching failure.

That was rock bottom. My wife was trying so hard to be supportive, but I could see the fear in her eyes. I had the job offer from my old company sitting in my inbox, a guaranteed paycheck just one click away. It was tempting, like a siren song for the defeated. But something in me just couldn't do it. I couldn't go back to that beige cubicle. While wallowing in my cheesy failure, I had another idea – a much less glamorous one. It was a simple project management tool designed specifically for the kind of small, chaotic marketing teams I used to work on. No frills, no venture capital buzzwords, just a tool to solve a problem I knew intimately.

I spent the next six months fueled by cheap coffee and desperation, coding the most basic version imaginable. The first year was brutal. I think I made a grand total of $500. Not per month. Total. I was relentlessly emailing potential users, begging for feedback on obscure forums, and getting rejected 99% of the time. Every tiny bug felt like a personal failing, every silent inbox a confirmation that I'd made a huge mistake. I was so close to giving up more times than I can count.

Then, slowly, something started to shift. A few sign-ups turned into a dozen. A company I'd never heard of bought a yearly plan. The feedback started turning from 'this is broken' to 'can you add this feature?' Now, five years later, we're a small but profitable company with a tiny team. I make more than I ever did in my corporate gig, and more importantly, I control my own time. That feeling of waking up on a Monday and being excited to work is something I'd never trade. It was a grueling, terrifying journey, and it almost broke me, but man, was it worth it.

So, for anyone else out there who has stared at a failed project and a dwindling bank account, what's the one thing that kept you from just going back to a 'safe' job?",1,1762781518.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

It described my state of mind perfectly. I am in limerence.

She’s a very special friend. She confides in me about her deep insecurities. She's very beautiful. The problem is I am married and she knows it too. We just have coffee to talk and sometimes lunch. Nothing special. But I can't stop thinking about her.

I thought about leaving my wife, but I can't stand the thought of not being able to see my child every night. The ticket to my child is to remain married to a wretched woman who doesn’t respect me.

I really wanted to tell her, but I know I must never vent about my wife. But I want to share about my midlife crisis own. But ChatGPT tried to dissuade me. “It's the beginning of an emotional affair.” To hell with you! An affair with this angel of a lady is a godsend.

In fact, my wife discovering the affair and forcing a divorce on me is perhaps what I am after. I want to tell her everything and i want her to tell me everything. I will listen and validate her feelings like a good friend.

XOXOXOXOXO

We were laying there, intertwined. Basking in the adrenaline rush. Slowly we separated. Amy protesting the interruption as I went to shut off the video recording on the phones and placed them on the chargers.

  
Laying there, basking in the afterglow was this beautiful human. The glow a woman has, after being properly fucked is unmistakable. Her eyes begging you to come back into bed and hold her. 

Crawling back into bed, covering both of us with a blanket. Amy curled into my chest and slept. The sleep that comes from physical exhaustion when the mind also shuts down. 

I however, was still trying to process two words; Best friend. Those two words laid heavy on my heart. Lover was easy. Companion was harder but best friend was going to take some time to process properly. Sleep came as a relief. 

The morning alarm hasn’t even went off yet. I can feel Amy massaging my morning wood. She looks at me with those beautiful eyes and smiles. Why this beautiful creature decided that she wants me is baffling. Laying back, I am the one receiving this morning. Amy is in control. The kissing and stroking. Sucking and teasing.  Sometimes taking me all the way into her throat others just sucking the tip. All the while caressing my balls. Then a finger that slowly teases my asshole up my taint and back. Relaxing the penetration feels so good. Looking into those eyes and realize she needs me to know what I mean to her. She silently mouths, ‘I love you.’ The pressure starts to build as the second finger slides in. Causing me to have a catch in my breathing. My hips start to buck and a moan can’t help but escape.

“Oh Amy, oh fuck.” 

Hips buck and as my whole body contracts. The tip is held in her mouth those beautiful lips holding me. After the wave has passed she crawls up my body. She kisses me and shares her reward. My mouth and hers locked together sharing the moment. 

“Good morning handsome.” 

The alarm goes off. One last kiss as she moves out of the bed. Busying herself getting ready to leave. Rolling over I head to the kitchen to start the coffee. No clothes , still just feeling the moment.  The shower starts in the bathroom just as the coffee is finishing. Two cups are poured, the first sip starts to energize the body. 

Delivering the second cup to Amy, standing in the shower. She smiles takes a sip, feels the energy start to return. Handing it back to be placed beside my cup on the counter. Stepping into the shower with her. Needing to hold her close. Whatever Amy is, lover, companion, fling, mistake or blessing the title doesn’t matter right now. The water cascading down our two bodies as a kiss is shared. My hand slides down to offer a reciprocation for the earlier activity. A small head shake stops things before they start. Just standing there together. Holding each other and staving off the world. If only for few more minutes.",1,1762781043.0,u_DanandAmy-Thestory,0,1.0,False

At first, I couldn’t recognize myself. I was drowning in loops of our memories, replaying them endlessly, trying to find the moment everything began to fall apart. It hurt so deeply because what we had wasn’t just a relationship. It felt like a lifetime folded into a year and a half. We built our own little world together. We called each other “wife” and “hus,” shared everything from morning coffee talks to midnight confessions, laughed until our cheeks hurt, and dreamed like we were two souls born to find each other.

He always told me we were soulmates, that no matter what happened we were meant to be together, even if it took years, even if it took decades, he would wait. And I believed him. Every word. Because when you find a connection that pure, you don’t question it. You just feel it in your bones.

He also once told me he was deeply introverted and emotionally not very intelligent. I understood that about him. I always tried to meet him where he was, to love him through his silences. But that one day, I broke down. I told him, “I can’t take your shit for being offline. I’m tired. I want to end this.” The truth is, I didn’t want to end anything. I just wanted to be with him, to feel seen, to feel like he wanted me too.

And then, he vanished.

The silence that followed wasn’t just emptiness. It was the shattering of something sacred. It felt like losing a part of my own soul, like the air had gone thin around me. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, couldn’t understand how someone who called me his soulmate could suddenly disappear into nothing.

I reached a point where I couldn’t carry the pain alone. I spoke to a psychiatrist and started antidepressants. After the first dose, I felt a small flicker of calm. Not healing, but a breath. A single breath after days of drowning.

Reading everyone’s stories here reminded me that I’m not alone. So many people have been left in silence, still trying to stitch their hearts back together. Life is too precious to be lost waiting on someone who chose to vanish.

I deactivated Instagram, blocked him on WhatsApp, and left only email and X open. Maybe there’s still a tiny piece of me that hopes he realizes what he did, that he feels regret or shame someday. But I can’t keep waiting in that space between hope and heartbreak.

To everyone who took time to comfort me, thank you. Your words carried me through the longest nights.

If your heart is still aching like mine, remember this. Don’t live in the past. Don’t fear tomorrow. Just breathe today.

Because even after losing what felt like destiny, life still has meaning. Love still exists. And one day, we’ll look back and realize that even the silence was teaching us how to stand on our own 😭 ",2,1762781024.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

I oscillate between my extrovert / introvert selves, but one cannot exist without the other, so I have to nourish both sides of self if that makes sense. (AuDHD reporting for duty 🫡)

I started waking up at 7am to have a few hours of alone time in the house / drink my coffee / write , but he's started getting up earlier and earlier (9:30-->7a) and my alone time is dwindling and I feel myself getting really fucking pissed about it. I've been getting up earlier and earlier to try and beat him to it (hello, 5am) but it's killing me (hello, 9pm crash out) and I can't handle this much schedule shifting tbh. I also REALLY need my alone time, and he doesn't understand that it's not the same even if he just ""silently gets up and gets a cup of coffee""- my brain doesn't view it as the same thing bc it's now aware I'm being perceived 🫩 
Most of the time, he's immediately alert and ready to talk about the day and I just... really, really, really need my unstructured quiet morning time 😫 when I don't get it, it makes me feel like I can't live in society anymore / on this planet. 
FWIW: I'm a silent lil mouse and he's a heavy sleeper, so I'm not like waking him up with noise or anything. 

He likes to do... everything together and I am a lone wolf in recovery, lol. Aka, I fucking love being alone / doing shit solo / whatever - it's super nourishing for me. My morning alone time was how I was supplementing this before a day of human interactions with folks coming over to our house to rehearse & record for four hours in our living room (we have 1300 sq ft lol) and I'm struggling by the end of the week without my alone time bc these interactions eat a TON of spoons, even though I really enjoy it! But still, le spoon tax. (Also: I knew what I signed up for in this respect and I love our set up / our community / etc, just need the recharge time)

My work isn't mobile & frankly, I loooove being in my own space so I don't want to give all that up just to get some alone time, but I don't fucking get why he needs to encroach on this ONE shred of ""unsupervised"" solo home time. I love him but I don't love anyone this much 😫😫😫 get da fuq away from me bro, this is my special time!!!!!!!! AHHHHHH.

I go for morning / afternoon / evening walks, but I just want some house time to myself ya know? 

For any astrology homies out there, I am also a Sag ☀️ Aquarius 🌕 Pisces ⬆️.
Aka: Ye Olde Brain™️ is already a natural battlefield of push & pull, lmao 

Admittedly I'm not looking for solutions because I'm aware that they're there, I just wanna vent about it with y'all because it just happened to me again and I AGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Morning! ",35,1762780992.0,AuDHDWomen,13,0.96,False
1otdm5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1otdm5x/hr_the_saviour/,[HR] The Saviour,"Hi Susan,

You know I don’t write much these days. I have gotten bored now, of repeating myself. I have talked to you a lot, about everything that I think, about every incomplete thought, of the wonders my mind is capable of imagining into existence. This year, I had finally gotten out of my rut, with your help of course. When I decided that I should go out and meet people, I was pretty terrified; I knew them so little, the only interactions I had with people were either professional or, if personal, were decades old. The world has changed, Susan. But today was very different, and I thought it required a message to you.
I met Sam today; he is a 16-year-old boy, just in his senior year at school, and he was a peculiar person. I was just picking up groceries when I saw Sam picking up his toiletries; he seemed sad, and with months of practice, I decided I had to help him. I had to save him from himself; I needed to. So I went up to him and asked, “Hi! You seem sad; is there any way I can help?” He was frozen for a minute; I mean, of course, seeing a guy twice your age come up to you and ask this warranted further investigation in his mind, but he finally decided to speak: “Hi! I don’t think you can help me; I just have a lot in my mind, regarding life and all. I am sure you don’t want to hear my story, but hey, thanks for asking!” Susan, you know I see pain; I honestly feel it, to the extent that I am now unsure whether I feel other things, or just the absence of pain sometimes. I had to help him, for you, Susan. I took him to the food court, ordered for both of us, and asked him, “Tell me, Sam, what’s on your mind? I would be happy to hear it; I believe the more you talk about something, the lighter it weighs on you. The only thing that people protect—their secrets—are important to them because they don’t tell people; if they ever do, that secret is lost and gets out of the mind. So, Sam, tell me your secret, if you want to.” Susan, the things Sam told me were beautiful; they were a true moment of emotions, a moment that etched into me. He said, “My father is ill. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s 6 years back, and now it’s nearing its end, getting worse. I don’t know what to do, how to deal with it. My mother is a housewife; she was married at a young age. I mean, who does that? Why did they need to? I am still angry at my grandparents for marrying her so young; she didn’t deserve that. She wasn’t allowed a formal education, and now she has taken up a few menial jobs, just so we can afford to live. I don’t like this. I am just very angry, but I am tired too; I don’t even know who I am angry with. So yeah, sometimes I can’t control the thoughts, and they spill on my face. Today was that. I am sorry for telling you all this; you are just a random stranger; you shouldn’t have to bear my burdens.” I was shocked, Susan, not at his condition—that didn’t interest me a mere bit—but the resilience of this boy. I asked him then, “Do you think if you found out who you’re angry at, things will feel better?” He said, “I guess; maybe I will have a direction; an enemy you know is better than a friend you don’t. But I have thought about it a lot, and I don’t think there is an answer to that question.” “I study the minds of people, Sam; let me ask you a few questions, and tell me your answers to them,” I said, and he agreed. I had a few generic things to ask first: “Do you love your father?” “I don’t know anymore. He is a great dad; I have always remembered him as a loving person, a caring person; he enrolled me in a good school, and I owe him everything, but—” he stopped; he hesitated to say the next part. In the time of this silence, I had imagined the worst: the abuse, the disconnect, everything. “But what, Sam?” I asked. “But he knew grandfather had Alzheimer’s, and there was a high probability of him getting it too. Why did he birth me into this world, with such a curse?” He had a point: when one knows that there is even a slight possibility of pain, without much of a positive, why would they bring a child into this world? Sam had a bad fate written even before he came into this world. But I needed to see if I could change his mind, so I said, “Sam, he also didn’t ask to be born, right? What you are feeling, I am pretty sure he must have felt too. If you give a hand to a drowning person, they would pull you in too; is that their fault, or just a survival instinct?” He took a pause, as if to think, but now I feel he already had his answer ready, because when he started, he said all of this in a repeated and rehearsed way: “Yeah, but either I think my father is weak or I think he is immoral. If he couldn’t stay alone, he should have taken it as his responsibility and stopped this punishment for me. Every day I live is more difficult than the other, and soon I will have to face everything I am seeing with him. I don’t know how to be happy anymore.” I understood his age; people are rebellious and angry all the time. I have experienced this myself, and I have seen yours too. The best way to deal with naive people is to start agreeing with them, and they will soon jump to protect their small, unformed ego. The food arrived: a tray of burgers and fries. I stopped this discussion and asked him to focus on the food. We started talking about other things: his hobbies, which were once playing basketball, were now just checking ads in the newspaper for part-time jobs with no age restriction. He had to leave school and stay at home because he had no money for tuition. Yeah, Susan, he lied earlier. He did say not all parts were bad; he got closer to his mother, his only companion in this pain. He couldn’t decide whose pain was more, but at least there was something they had in common, something to bond over. In the evenings, his mother used to make tea just for the two of them; they sat in their little courtyard, facing a railway line. On evenings like these, he felt a glimmer of hope.
Our food was over now, and we started walking; his home was close to mine, so we decided to walk to his home. Susan, it was a beautiful evening today, I tell you: sun deep in the sky, painting everything orange. The roads looked fiery, extending long, filled with vehicles, people in a rush, behind their own little lives, no one caring about Sam. As we crossed the park, with children playing on the swings, happy, deluded, while their parents sat beside, talking adult stuff, happy to see their children—whose lives they had destroyed—I said, “Sam, why do you think these people are happy?” He said, “Because they can provide for their children, I guess. But I am not sure if they should be.” I pretended to agree with him: “I think you are right, but aren’t we all social beings? You know, loneliness can kill people, and maybe worse, they may kill someone. I think they just choose to do the lesser damage and hold their problems within only a few people, who they call their family.” I turned to him and saw a sense of happiness and peace on his face, as if he had finally found someone who understood him. I too felt like he was a friend. He said, “Maybe you are right. But doesn’t that make a person just weak then? If they understand the gravity of the situation and still choose to make a family to loathe their pain on?” I still had to agree with him to make him arrive at my point naturally. “I guess they are weak, but why does it matter? To them, it’s not that big a discussion. What we deem as good or bad is just what the majority of people accept. Society accepts birthing as a natural process of life and welcomes it with celebrations and respect. Your social credit goes up; you end up less lonely because after a point, you won’t have much to share with people around you if you don’t live lives like theirs.” He let out a faint smile, as if everything he was feeling was coming from a place of despair and there was something in my words that felt like hope. He got curious and asked, “But what about the family? Wouldn’t they be hurt? Isn’t it selfish?” I calmly replied, “It probably is, but you as a parent would never want anything bad for your kid. I have a kid; she’s 15, and there is nothing I wouldn’t do for her. You wouldn’t feel selfish when you have a kid; you will want to endure for their happiness.” But then Sam went on and said something that ruined it all, with a cheerful smile on his face: “I think you are right. I do feel lonely and hugely responsible. He brought me here, gave me everything I have to the best of his abilities, and he is happy about it. Maybe I am not cursed; maybe I do have a hope. I never asked him this, but he always had peace on his face. I see your point. Thank you for meeting me today.” We had just reached my home, and I would have gone in happily, and nothing would have happened; he shouldn’t have said that. I had to, Susan, so I asked him to come in. I said with a big smile, “I’m glad I could help you, Sam. You seem like a decent guy. And you are pretty smart too. If it’s okay with you, I’d like you to meet my daughter; I feel you two would be good friends. And maybe you could talk to her about what you talked with me; that’s more age-appropriate.” I laughed at my snarky remark, and so did he; he agreed to join for a coffee and came in.
As he came inside, I grabbed him and put some chloroform on his mouth, knocking him unconscious. I then picked him up and took him to the basement, carefully tying him to the chair. I put another chair in front of him and sat there, staring at him, imagining how it would all be different if he hadn’t said that. He was deeply hurt; he understood his situation, yet found hope. I find people like Sam very disturbing; these are the people who have their eyes open but choose to close them. He woke up a little while later, feeling drowsy, slowly opening his eyes, gaining his consciousness back every second. Right when he realized his situation, his squeaking voice went silent, and fear flushed on his face. I could see the terror on his face, but that didn’t worry me too much; that was expected. I calmly leaned forward, looked into his eyes, and said, “Sam, I am going to kill you, but trust me, ‘kill’ is not the emotion that’s correct here; I am going to save you.” “AAaaarrghghhhhh Hee…ll…pppppp…..” he screamed at the top of his lungs, looking straight into my eyes, ready to break any second now. I leaned back into the chair and looked at him; he screamed for 10 minutes straight, or maybe it was 20; I am not sure. I was so alive, I couldn’t focus on trivialities. I waited until he was quiet. I knew he would scream; they all do. After being with so many people, I sincerely believe in the five stages of grief now. The screaming was, of course, denial: not able to understand that they don’t have what they once had, the first realization of loss. But I was intrigued to see the next stage—anger. I have seen two types of anger in people: one where they lash out, threatening, even though they probably realize they can’t do anything. Everything that gave them the confidence to be angry was no more. I don’t like these people because you should be done with that in the denial phase, right? Anyway, I had high expectations from Sam, and he did not disappoint. He calmed down, with little sobs in between his words, and said, “I can’t believe I trusted you; you were just a stranger; I let you in once, and you did this. Don’t you feel bad for doing this to me? What did I do to you?” and he broke down into tears. This was the second type: being angry at themselves, quietly, understanding the situation and curious as to what ended them there. I love that humans always strive for answers, even when they don’t know if they want to hear the answer. I let out a calming smile and said, “Sam, I really respect you; the life you have lived so far has been full of pain, but you didn’t give up; you kept trying because you felt that giving up would hurt people. I wanted to let you go after seeing the anger you had for your father, for you were one who understood the truth and had the strength to go through with it. I really felt good talking to you; I could see myself in you. But understand, I needed to check your will. I needed to make sure that no one could change your mind. And unfortunately, you did. You shouldn’t have, Sam. I am very sorry for you. You lack the strength you accuse others of not having.” As I said this, I could see a pinch of hope on his face; he felt, like everyone else, that since he now knew his fault, he could plead his way out of this. He said, still sobbing but more hopeful this time around, “I am really sorry; I shouldn’t have said that. Maybe I am not that smart, but you know I understand your view, right? You do, right? I promise I’ll change; I’ll be stronger; I won’t let anyone else go through this again. Please leave me; I promise I won’t tell anyone about you. I will change; I promise; I fucking promise!” raising his voice at the end, as if to convince me of his resolve. I let out a laugh at his naivety, saying, “You see, Sam, you are smart; I know that, and you would, of course, tell people if I leave you, as you should. See, maybe you had a chance now if you just stuck to your character, but you couldn’t. I can’t trust you, Sam; you need to be saved.” As I said this, his face dropped, empty of words, shocked, I guess, or maybe he was just curious what comes next; I couldn’t see him so sad. He had said it’s better to have a known enemy, so I decided to tell him about you. His bargaining had ended now, and what he was facing was the depression of the situation. I wanted to help him get to the next stage, so I said, “Sam, I had a daughter; her name was Susan. She was my world, my everything. I still remember the day she was born; I was so happy until I got the news that I had lost Joanna, my wife. I couldn’t look at Susan for weeks; my friends helped me out, but then I realized that what happened to her was far worse, so I let go, Sam; I let go. I started being a good dad. I loved my baby. When she was 10, she was diagnosed with a very rare disease: an early-onset ALS. She would slowly lose control of her body, every part failing one after another, until she was trapped in her mind, unable to speak, unable to cry. I went through everything you are going through, Sam; I was you, but even worse, I was your father. I had brought Susan into this world, into this cursed world which can’t bear the happiness of people. Everyone here is sad. But anyway, as her disease progressed over the years, I left my job, started taking care of her, but things seemed bleaker every day. The doctors had declared her terminal, and she was smart, Sam; she was as smart as you. She had already accepted her life and wanted to go. It took me time to understand her decision, even accept it. But I couldn’t see my baby in pain, so I agreed; I filed a case for doctor-assisted euthanasia. I had thought that was the hardest thing to do.” I let out a big laugh, as if I was laughing at the past me. I love you, Susan, and when I remember it, it still hurts. “Wha…ttt ha..ppe…nned to her?” Sam forced his words. I said, “What do you think, Sam? The court rejected the plea. Apparently, they decided for her that her life still was worth living and there was a hope for a new cure every other day. I was struck when I heard them say this. I went home and told her, with my face resting on her face as I couldn’t stop crying, but she put her hand on my shoulder and comforted me, saying that it was going to be okay; she’ll be out soon anyway. But we both knew that was not true; what was going to follow shouldn’t be experienced by anyone. I put her to bed and went outside, but as soon as I closed the door, I could hear a faint cry from her room. I couldn’t control myself and fell on my knees; my baby was crying, and there was nothing that I could do. I stayed there for hours, staring blankly at the ceiling, until I remembered my vow of doing anything for her. I quietly went into her room and woke her up and told her I was going to save her. She burst out in tears and hugged me. We stayed there for some time, maybe 10 minutes or 20; I can’t focus on trivialities here, Sam. Then I put her on some anesthesia and held her head, talking to her until she fell asleep, for the last time. Sam, trust me, it hurt me a lot, but it had to be done; she didn’t deserve any of that, and all I did was what I should have done. So, after her, I decided it was my responsibility to save people like you from the eternal torment of life.” Sam raised his head slightly, looking me in my eyes and declaring with a straight face, “I understand. I do. And honestly, I have been thinking of doing this but couldn’t get the courage up. I should be thankful to you. Can I ask for a favor though?” Tell me, Susan, how can I deprive a person from their final wish, a final desire which I could fulfill? And so I agreed. “Can you please send my mother a voice note?” I agreed to it and took my phone out. He said, “Mom, it’s Sam. I am going, Mom; this man is freeing me. I tried to explain everything to him, but I couldn’t; I am sorry, Mom. Our lives are very difficult, Mom, and I feel so bad for being this incapable of changing it, especially right now. I just want you to know I am going relieved, Mom; I love you.” His face became expressionless, Susan; that’s what interests me the most; that’s why I am writing this to you. He went to acceptance; no one before ever has. He calmly asked, his tears dried now, “How will I go?” I replied with equal determinism: “I care for you, Sam; I will put you to sleep; you’ll not feel any pain. I will then inject you with this,” I said, and pulled out the snake head. You remember the snake head, right? I got it a few weeks before, and some snake venom; I could now puncture someone with that. I devised a way so that it doesn’t look bad. I could see peace on his face now. I got up from my chair and untied him. I asked him to lie on the bed. Ahh, I forgot to tell you: I have redecorated the basement; it looks beautiful now. I knew you liked spending time here. There is a bed on one side of the room, fairy lights on the wall around, all yellow, giving the room positive vibes. I have two chairs, properly padded for comfort, and a TV. I stay here all the time; it keeps me grounded, pun intended. He lay down on the bed, and I injected him with the anesthesia. We talked about how what he was doing was not unfair to anyone. He was really interested in the snake head; I told him, “I like to make the death interesting. A person having an interesting life is not really in their hands, but having an interesting death sure is. And this sure is interesting.”
We talked until his last thoughts came up, and as he fell asleep, a tear rolled down his eyes, and seeing that, I sobbed too, but just for a moment. He is gone now. You know I don’t believe in the afterlife; that’s how I like to live my life; it gives me comfort, Susan. But when I die, I would believe that there existed something beyond; I want to die with hope, so I told him, my final words to him: “Don’t worry, Sam; you’ll meet many good people up there. Goodbye!” He is gone now, Susan, and I am going to save his mother next, but I will leave his father unharmed; that man must see what he did and relive it fresh every day. Anyway, Susan, he is lying on the bed; I need to plan what to do with his body; that’s the hardest part, you know. I just know, Susan, that all lives are not worth living, and I don’t want anyone else to endure what you had to, so I will continue to do so until I can. I love you, Susan; I always will, and I hope to see you soon.

It’s not meant to be anything commercial, just something for people who like tracking what they’re drinking. I'm not a software engineer but I love to tinker and honestly spent *way* too much time figuring out how to get the keyboard to push up the input fields so they don't overlap 😅

There were some cool solutions out there, but I really started getting into coffee bag art/designs and also wanted to ensuring I was showcasing some of the cool roasters I found. Current functionality includes:

1. **Log** \- this is where you can log a new bag of beans or a cup of coffee (from your beans or elsewhere). I ultimately worked on the ability to log beans, but realized we should add cup functionality as well, although I don't really find that as exciting to log each cup you have, but who knows! There's some basic AI scanning where you can take a photo of the beans and it tries to extract details. You can choose to log all your beans and rate them later, or log and rate at the same time. I also preloaded about 2K roasters and am working on getting descriptions and photos for everything --- after all, I wanted this to look aesthetically pleasing!
2. **Feed** \- Think of this like the legacy Venmo feed. Really just shows all activity that's happening in the app. People logging/rating new beans or cups. There's a follower section where you can see what's happening with your friends or people you follow. You can like and comment on feed entries.
3. **Discover** \- The last module I created when I realized there really should be more of a discovery option. This is meant to allow you to see the top rated roasters from the community and the beans. There's also a top cups section here as well. Again, I didn't spend a ton of time on this because I just assumed it wouldn't be used as much. It also allows you to search for any of the roasters in our database. I am constantly adding new ones!
4. **Library** \- This is where all your logged beans and cups live. You have a record of all your logged beans and cups. You can change your ratings or edit the details. You also can indicate if the beans are in-stock or not.

That's basically it. Again, if there's interest to play around, I'd be happy to listen to your feedback and see how I can incorporate.

Ever feel like you're running on a hamster wheel? You're busy, but not productive. Tired, but can't sleep. You *know* you're capable of more, but you just feel... stuck. I've been there. Big time.

But over the last year, I've been collecting these little ""life hacks"" that have genuinely shifted the needle for me. They're not about massive, painful overhauls. They're about small, smart adjustments that create huge ripples.

Here are a few of my favorites that have given me back my time, energy, and sanity.

**⚡️ For More ENERGY:**

*   **Win the First Hour.** Seriously, this is a game-changer. For the first 60 minutes of your day, do NOT touch your phone. No social media, no news, no emails. Hydrate, stretch, meditate, journal, stare at a wall... anything but reactive scrolling. You set the tone for your day, not your notifications.
*   **The 3 PM Reset.** Instead of reaching for that fourth coffee, get up. Do 20 jumping jacks, walk around the block, or just stretch for 5 minutes. It gets the blood flowing and breaks the afternoon slump.
*   **Audit Your Drains.** Spend one day consciously noting what activities and which people leave you feeling drained vs. energized. The results can be shocking. Do less of what drains you. Simple, but not easy.

**⏰ For More TIME:**

*   **The 2-Minute Rule.** If a task takes less than two minutes to complete (replying to an email, putting a dish away, taking out the trash), do it *immediately*. It's amazing how much mental clutter this clears up.
*   **Batch Your Chores.** Don't answer emails as they come in. Set aside two specific blocks a day for them. Same for laundry, meal prep, or any recurring task. Grouping similar work is crazy efficient.
*   **""Theme"" Your Days.** Try dedicating days to specific types of work. E.g., Mondays for planning & meetings, Tuesdays for deep creative work, Fridays for admin & wrap-up. It reduces context-switching and helps you get into a flow state faster.

**😊 For More HAPPINESS:**

*   **Curate Your Inputs.** You wouldn't eat junk food all day and expect to feel good, right? The same goes for your mind. Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad. Listen to uplifting podcasts. Be ruthless about protecting your mental space.
*   **""Did My Best"" List.** At the end of the day, instead of focusing on the to-do list you *didn't* finish, write down 3-5 things where you genuinely did your best. It reframes your day around effort and progress, not just completion.
*   **Schedule ""Nothing.""** Block out 30 minutes in your calendar for... nothing. No phone, no TV, no book. Just sit, daydream, or listen to music. True rest isn't just sleeping; it's giving your brain a chance to unwind.

Sometimes, the biggest block isn't a lack of a good system, but our own mindset getting in the way. It can be a real struggle to figure out the 'why' behind our procrastination or low energy. If you're feeling stuck in that loop and need a more structured way to work through your emotions and create a solid plan, I've found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for getting that clarity.

It all comes down to small, consistent actions. You don't have to do all of these at once! Just pick one that resonates and give it a try this week.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

She has always been very intense with my partner (29M), she babies him but can also be oddly critical. We’re about to fully move in together and I feel like she still sees him as a child, which then makes me feel like I’m supposed to pick up the emotional responsibility. It’s suffocating.

My partner recently switched careers and is training to be a teacher. I’m really proud of him. But his mum is acting like he’s curing cancer. Every conversation is about him. I get a quick “how are you?” as an afterthought. I’ve helped him proof assignments and then she went and printed his work, proofed it again, and physically posted feedback through my door… we live 15 minutes away. It felt like she had to one-up me.

Meanwhile, I bought the house we live in. I’ve been covering all bills and living costs the past few months (he does groceries/housework but I’m financially supporting us right now). I don’t need applause but it’s hard watching him get praised for basics while my achievements are ignored.

It’s his 30th soon. I planned a weekend away in London (hotel, dinner, gifts). MIL hinted it was “too much.” Yet she’s throwing a surprise party (which he would not choose) and has assigned me tasks: bake 40 brownies, distract him, make a playlist, confirm guests, etc. She texts me constantly about it.

She even took me for coffee with five pages of notes, and brought novelty toilet paper samples for the party?? I don’t come from a family like this and honestly it feels overwhelming, not sweet. I’ve been in tears this weekend from the pressure. It also feels gendered like I’m expected to take on the “organiser woman” role in her vision of things.

I don’t want to ruin anything for him, but this is a lot. A few months ago I saw a text from her saying “my darling son, your sandwiches have been dutifully made.” He’s almost 30. Even he finds it weird.

He spoke to her gently but she didn’t really get it. He’s supportive, but I feel like I’m being pushed into being the stable, capable one who handles everyone’s emotions, and it’s draining.

I know I need better boundaries and I’m trying, but I’m questioning myself. Is this normal family enthusiasm and I need to chill, or is this genuinely concerning behaviour from a future MIL and I’m right to feel overwhelmed?",4,1762780887.0,AITAH,20,1.0,False

**Financial Highlights:**
- Revenue for Q3 2025 was $66.7 million, up 21% from $54.9 million in Q3 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, revenue was $166.3 million, up 10% from $150.5 million for the same period in 2024.

- Net income attributable to shareholders for Q3 2025 was $10.2 million ($0.09 per basic share); for the nine months, net income was $30.0 million ($0.27 per basic share), versus a net loss of $(27.2) million ($(0.25) per share) in the same YTD period 2024.
- Adjusted EBITDA was $20.3 million for Q3 2025 (Q3 2024: $5.3 million), and $33.6 million for nine months YTD 2025 (2024: $5.3 million).
- Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at period end totaled $87.6 million, up from $24.6 million 12 months prior.

**Segment Results:**
- **Canadian Cannabis:** Q3 net sales were $46.6 million (up from $36.5 million), gross profit $26.0 million (Q3 2024: $9.6 million), segment net income $11.7 million (Q3 2024: $1.2 million), adjusted EBITDA $19.3 million (Q3 2024: $4.8 million). Strong international sales growth, with international revenue up 758% year-over-year for the quarter, largely driven by medical exports to Germany.
- **U.S. Cannabis:** Q3 net sales were $3.3 million (Q3 2024: $3.9 million), with a segment net loss of $0.4 million and negative adjusted EBITDA.
- **Netherlands Cannabis:** Initiated sales in 2025. Q3 net sales were $3.6 million, gross margin of 46%. Segment net income was $0.8 million, adjusted EBITDA $1.3 million.

- Share count at November 2025: 115.52 million shares outstanding.
- $10 million share repurchase program (up to ~5.7 million shares) authorized September 2025; no shares purchased as of quarter end.

**Discontinued Operations/Divestitures:**
- On May 30, 2025, closed the sale of certain Fresh Produce operations (Vanguard Food, LP), receiving $35 million in cash plus $5 million restricted cash. The transaction generated a $20.0 million gain.
- Net income from discontinued operations for the nine months: $11.0 million (2024: $(4.8) million).

**Risks and Considerations:**
- Continued regulatory/compliance burdens, particularly Canadian cannabis excise taxes ($15.7 million in Q3). Uncertainty remains around potential excise tax reform.
- Variable interest rate debt ($34.6 million at September 30, 2025) exposes the company to interest rate risk; weighted average borrowing cost was 6.9%.
- Significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility due to Canadian and European operations.
- Execution risks remain around scaling in newer markets (Netherlands), and realizing benefits from divestitures.
- No material legal proceedings disclosed.

**Operational Updates:**
- Canadian operations expanded cultivation and reported market share gains; high gross margins (above target 30–40% range) in Canadian cannabis for third straight quarter.
- Netherlands business achieved significant coffee shop penetration and operational expansion is underway (Phase II facility expected Q1 2026).
- U.S. cannabis business continued to await resolution of pending medicinal marijuana license application in Texas.
- IT and internal controls improvements completed in early 2025.

**Conclusion:**
Village Farms demonstrated substantial growth in profitability in nine months 2025, driven by Canadian cannabis momentum and divestiture gains. Strong cash position and improved capital discipline were offset by continuing regulatory and market risks, particularly in Canada. Emerging international markets and a share buyback program could support shareholder value; continued execution and evidence of stable profitability from recent growth investments remain key for investors.

I'm stuck in my relationship and I really don't know where to go from here. I know relationships can sometimes require sacrifice and compromise, but how much is too much?

**Background/Context**: My bf and I began dating a little while after he officially ended things with his long term gf (10+ years). The decision was mutual and both parties agreed that there was no romance. To preface what's to come in this post, I want to say that I believe, and have from the start of our relationship, that there is no romance between the two.

In the year and some months since they broke it off and we got together, things between us have been amazing and rocky. There have been a decent number of situations where I felt that my boundaries were crossed and felt that I wasn't being prioritized, and some of these situations surrounded his ex.

Now, him and his ex have been in touch mostly since they share assets that will have to be split. Early on, the two wanted to remain friends but weren't sure how that would work. I admit, I wasn't thrilled at the idea of my bf being friends with his ex. But I (sorta) accepted it because of a particular situation (1). There are other instances afterwards, so to avoid this post being way too long, I'll quickly list the rest of them (+ a rough timeline):

1. (Summer/Fall 2024) They went to a concert together a few months after the split. I was upset because my bf didn't ask if I was okay with it before accepting the offer. I had communicated how I felt about them going together and that I wasn't comfortable with him seeing his ex. After he explained that this was to see how their relationship would be going forward, I eventually came around to the idea of them hanging out 1 on 1. But I didn't like the concert and suggested a coffee chat instead. He said that he understood my position but would still be going, and he did.
2. (Fall/Winter 2024) I asked him to post a photo of us on his Instagram story, which he did, but blocked his ex from seeing it. Reason: not to hurt her feelings. Similarly, he would change his wallpaper (photo of us) whenever he'd go over to her house. Again, to not hurt her feelings. I was told that she and I were ""on the same level"" in his mind. \[They technically both own the property, he'd go for renos\].
3. Vented to her about our relationship problems (problems that involved her). It happened only once that I know of. It made me feel very embarrassed.
4. (Feb/March 2025, arguably the worst pain I've felt in a relationship and I can't seem to get over this): He accepted an invite from her to go on a ski trip on the other side of the country with her & mutuals. I immediately said no when he asked if it was okay with him going, only to learn that he had booked everything already. I cried and begged for weeks to no avail. At the time I did break up with him, but got back with him since he experienced a tough job loss. He promised to set strict, clear boundaries with her after the trip. But that didn't really work out as I hoped.

\[Not related to his ex but another big issue that affected our relationship happened in May/June 2025 where he invited a girl-buddy over one night to hangout + another mutual friend while I was abroad. I found out later through some videos, he told me he was afraid of how I'd react if he asked. It was a big issue for us, and while we eventually made amends, I felt deeply betrayed and hurt. It added onto the mental/emotional toll I was feeling off the heels of the ski trip situation\].

**Here's where it begins to get messy:** At this point, I couldn't stand it any longer. I told him that if I were to stay, he'd have to limit his interactions with her to what was needed (i.e. asset separation talks). He agreed, albeit reluctantly.

Now I get that this may seem extreme, but I felt at the time considering what I've gone through that it was only fair. Yes, I wasn't keen on him being friends with his ex at first, but I compromised on that since it meant a lot to him. But what I wanted in return was clear communication, healthy boundaries with his ex, and for me to feel prioritized. I didn't get those at the time. Instead, I had to fight for it, go through the pains of feeling betrayed, feeling like second rate. I had to over-explain my feelings and how his actions affected me post-fight, and often felt like I was forcing an apology out of him. These situations were really tough on me emotionally and mentally, but I pushed through it because I had to for the sake of keeping this going. I hate having to be like this kind of person though, it's not me.

**Where we're at now:** He's changed over the course of our relationship. He's much better at communicating, being open and understanding during disagreements, and tries his hardest to be more empathetic to me. He deeply regrets his actions and says he wishes he could take those back. He's also slowly distanced himself from her, but won't let her go completely. They're still friends and talk/hang out at times, it doesn't seem like he'll stop that ever. That realization just feels like a punch in the gut. I know he's changed, but I'm having a hard time moving on from the issues we've had ~~or maybe I can't fully believe that he has changed?~~

**My whirlwind of thoughts & emotions:** I don't think he'll remove his ex from his life, does that mean I stayed and put up with this for nothing? Not that the end-goal was to remove the ex, but I compromised a lot, what does compromise look like for him to where I'm happy? Is it super toxic and controlling of me to tell him to not be friends with her? I don't want to be toxic, I want to understand him too, so is it better to put the past to the side, appreciate the person he is now and just compromise on his friendship? He's doing all the right things now for the most part, so why do I still feel so hurt and emotionally distant? I feel like I'm holding a lot of resentment and its fuelling my self-hatred.

So, now you know my life's current dilemma. Here's my question to you all: where do you draw the line between catering to your partners needs and preserving your sense of self-worth? When you have compromised, how do you stop the feeling of self-betrayal?

If people are interested I might post a more elaborate story tho. I feel like it's necessary for people to understand me but it's just way too long.

Last year I enrolled in a nearby college to study computer science, it's really the only thing I'm interested in. I had terrible experiences duuing middle and high school bc of things like getting pressured and misunderstood by my parents getting bullied and spending time on gaming instead of homework to surpress my depression. University would've been an option if I studied harder for maths but I always hated dealing with maths so I switched to an easier version just so I could pass my exams.

I was fed up and ashamed of my current life so I was hoping to change it by proving I could handle college so I could later live on my own and earn money without having to worry about studying anymore. Studying takes me a lot of time and effort bc I have trouble keeping myself motivated and get distracted easily, and want to spend time gaming or else I get depressed, so I can't really do much while I still need to worry about my degree. I never really enjoyed studying and going to school for multiple reasons, but I felt like this time I might actually enjoy it. The college wasn't far away from home which was amazing for someone who can barely take care of himself and barely has experience with traveling by themselves.

I know I'm horribly socially awkward but I tried hard to fit in. The open day gave me a good impression. The introduction day was awkward but I enjoyed it. On the second day already the first big group project started and I basically froze in fear then had a vitriolic reaction that just slipped out of my mouth ""Oh, I need to work together? Ugggggghhh"" I thought it was more individual based on what my mom told me (apparently this applies only to university and not to college/hbo) I barely even got used to the new environment and already I was forced to deal with annoying kids who are crass loudmouths, are only into mainstream stuff rather than the niche indie and Japanese games I'm into, and probably think badly and weirdly of me. The PTSD of my bad experiences with kids from high school to came forth.

I had a rough start but I did my best with the things that were assigned to me. However bc I sometimes didn't understand what was going on bc I had pretty much no prior experience and my autism might have made it harder to understand, I had to ask my group mates for help frequently. I also got super annoyed by kids in my class talking loudly about random BS which really distracted me. I didn't dare to address anyone about it bc I feared they'd hate me. I tried to avoid standing out or being the center of attention. When I had to design a website for some fictional company I made a butt-ugly milquetoast of a design with the only real goal I had in mind being passing the requirements. I had to ask group mates for feedback a LOT bc I did not want to get a bad grade, I needed to leave a good impression on my familty so they won't resist about the idea of the absolute failure that I am going to college. It is expensive after all and I don't wanna waste it. I feared that people would make fun of me if I were to express creativity irl, not like I'm all that creative anyway. I was also tired often but I didn't take the free coffee bc I don't like coffee.

I had a few talks with my study coach and he basically told me I should quit college bc I'm autistic and awful at working with people, and I should take a self study that's expensive and seen as lower value by employers than an actual degree. This borderline pissed me off for many reasons and I insisted I needed to continue. It felt genuinely insulting to be met with this attitude while I just got started, and with me being gifted I was convinced I could make it easily. One of these talks demotivated me so hard that I traumadumped on the rest of my group that I'm gonna be forced to work at mcDonald's if I fail here.

Things were going okay-ish and well enough until the final week before the autumn break. We only had a few moments where the entire group was together left for the week and I needed to finish something before then. I  was practically clueless on why the thing I made didn't work like it should've. The rest of my group wasn't helping me and classmates were noisy as usual. With my usual tiredness in the morning and my dad having bitched about choosing the moment to go to bed for me even though I was 23 and not tired at that time, my tolerance for frustration was low. That's when the incident happened. I had a meltdown that destroyed my future. I slammed the table and shouted ""Why isn't it working?"" If people around me had weird reactions to that I didn't notice them, I was too busy worrying about my contribution to the project. Besides, in my household these kinds of situations were somewhat normal, pretty much every member of my family, especially my father, had a low anger tolerance and wasn't afraid to express it if push came to shove. Eventually I made some progress but none of it would've mattered.

Because later that day I was kicked out of my group. The rest of the group, and my study coach, basically old me that I was asking the rest of my group too often (which they could've communicated with me earlier, so I could adjust my behavior in time, but they CHOSE not to), and other dumb reasons like I occasionally got lost in the building while I was just getting used to it. And it absolutely, completely BROKE me. It basically reinfoced the labels and stigmas put on me that I am worthless and born to fail. My ONE chance to prove the opposite was gone. I had another mental breakdown, cried, and went home with my head held down in shame where my mom scolded me and my brother made fun of me. It's completely and utterly unfair, those kids from my group were being annoying and weird to me and I have a terrible life and no friends or a loving family compared to them and I had to take the blame for everything. Life is truly unfair.

The next day my coach told me I was banned from all future group projects bc of my behavior and my panic attacks and anger attacks. This completely destroyed my ego. It was basically hard proof that I was born for failure and disppointing my parents, and that bc of my autism I will never function in society and have a normal life, and that the 4chan trolls were right. I can't even do the one thing I'm supposedly good at.

I protested multiple times over the year begging him to let me back but nothing worked. He still let me go to individual lessons but that alone isn't enough to pass the year. So I barely had anything to do even though I wanted something to do and wanted to feel genuine progress toward my future, so I basically went back to my old NEET life, frustrated about being powerless and having no hope for the future. I argued with my mother a lot about my opinion of the situation, my life, my future, and how I was treated by my parents during middle and high school, and it annoyed my brother. I hate him bc he doesn't have an ounce of pity or care for me.

I really, really, REALLY need that degree for multiple reasons:

-I need it to convince my family that I'm not a worthless sack of shit, I also want to make up for the mistakes I made in the past in middle and high school and the trouble I always caused to my family, and eventually be able to financially support them and stop being a burden to them. I don't want them to pass away with regrets. I want to fulfill my parents' wish that they raised me for when I was young before it's too late. I also want to shut up my naysayer of a brother

-I want to have a bright future and live a normal life despite having autism, I want friends or just people around me who support me and are happy I'm there, maybe even start a family

-I want to live by myself bc my parents are extremely protective of me, my father can get dangerously aggressive and my brother annoys me and I feel trapped, as well as ashamed of myself for still living with my parents at this age

-I want my future career to fit me and let me use my talents and interests, with my giftedness I should be able to get an amazing career, otherwise I will be completely unmotivated

-I want to disprove or be immune to the negative stereotypes and labels from certain people like trolls on 4chan or X

I protested to my coach multiple times but nothing worked. At one point he told me to get an ""outpatient counselor"" (This is google translated idk how to describe it), and if they told him I'm suitable for college he'll let me back in. I protested bc of the waiting times. Eventually I got one but they also just discouraged me from going to college which pissed me off, basically my coach gave me a bogus solution to distract me. They also suggested some kind of special ed for computer science to me, which I basically saw as an insult, given how godwful my previous experience with special ed is, how I'm gonna have to spend a lot of time travelling bc as usual with special eds from my experiences, they're few and far inbetween, and how it will reinforce 4chan bullies' power to humiliate me if I have to go there instead of a regular college. I am well and capable of surviving a college, IF they just give me a chance and room for improvement. So I consider it an absolute hard pass. Eventually I had to call suicide hotlines frequently bc my life got really awful and I lost most of my hope for the future. My parents finally let me get mental help but progress is really slow and honestly barely anything changed so far.

Even in the next academic year his stance was still the same so I had to unsubscribe bc it'd be a waste of money otherwise. My coach distracted me with a boring, low-level self study course called CS50 which he initially hyped up as being useful to me and having a certificate that's enticing to employers. He also told me I could go to university next academic year but I'll need to study math again to get a certificate. I just wanted to avoid dealing with math again. Plus I dreaded all the travelling I'd need to do. I barely learned anything new from CS50 (some of it was covered in the individual subjects I was allowed to go to already) and it's not even close to being enough for a career for a gifted person. Plus it's isolated and boring. Essentially if fixes NONE of my problems. Also neither CS50 nor the study credit I earned from individual subjects will lead to exemption for subjects in university so basically that means I wasted an entire year and tons of college tuition on nothing. I'm gonna have to go through the same stuff for the third time in university, if this is true I'd rather not bother. And I have to deal with maths and travelling. This pissed me off so hard I became more determined to convince my coach again. Initially I was motivated to do CS50 and math but now I pretty much don't care anymore. I just want to go to a real college instead, and ASAP. 

At this point I am just sick and tired of everything. If my coach won't give me another chance to fix my life at college, I am seriously considering putting an end of everything. I'm so tired of the ennui of being unable to work on my future or live up to the expectations that not only my parents, but society as a whole put on me, and being stuck spending over half of the day gaming and being stuck with my stupid family instead of making progress toward a bright future, sometimes I'm not even in the mood to game anymore, I just want to work on my CS degree. I seriously need to convince him but idk what to even do at this point anymore.

New my therapist wants to involve the entire family which I don't want bc I my father will not react to it well, he's the backbone of the family, he works his ass off and is the only family member who earns money and also does a lot of chores, he doesn't have time to teach us many life skills either and my mother also has to do a lot of chores while we're supposed to focus on studying, he can do something stupid like kick me out of the house, I don't wanna take the risk. My brother doesn't care about it either. They're focusing on this instead of more pressing matters like me needing a proper daily life and needing to become suitable enough for college. My coach told me he will let me back if my therapist says I'm suitable.

Sorry that this post got so damn long again but it can't be helped, it doesn't even touch upon most of my life experience before my college attempts so a lot of context is missing but trust me I tried to keep it short.",3,1762780412.0,Gifted,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1otddmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BedroomLab/comments/1otddmj/do_lifttop_ottomans_wear_out_quickly/,Do lift-top ottomans wear out quickly?,"From what I’ve seen and experienced, lift-top ottomans don’t necessarily wear out quickly, but their lifespan heavily depends on three main factors: the build quality, how often you use the lift feature, and how much weight or pressure you put on it over time. A lot of people assume these ottomans are fragile because of the moving parts, but a well-constructed one can actually last for years without issues.

The lift mechanism itself is usually the first thing to show wear. Cheaper models tend to use thin metal brackets or lightweight hinges that loosen or lose alignment after repeated lifting. When that happens, the top can start to tilt slightly or not close flush anymore. If you want something that lasts, go for an ottoman that specifies a gas-lift or heavy-duty hinge system. Those mechanisms are smoother and handle the stress of daily use much better. I’ve had one in my bedroom for almost four years now, and the hinges are still solid because I picked one rated for 40,000 lift cycles. You can actually feel the difference when the hardware is strong enough to counterbalance the lid smoothly.

The second factor is how it’s used. A lot of people treat lift-top ottomans like coffee tables, placing drinks, decor, or even sitting on them while the lid is raised. That’s what really shortens their life. When the lid is lifted, the hinge system is under extra strain. Putting weight on it in that position bends the joints over time. If you use it correctly—lifting it fully before resting anything on top—you can avoid that mechanical fatigue.

Material choice also matters more than people think. Faux leather ottomans, for example, might start to crack or peel around the hinge area since that section moves a lot. Fabric ones tend to hold up better there, especially if they’re tightly upholstered and well-stitched. The frame inside is usually made of MDF or solid wood. MDF frames are fine for light use, but they do warp faster if you store heavier items inside or open and close them frequently.

So no, lift-top ottomans don’t inherently wear out fast, but the difference between a cheap $70 model and a well-built $200 one is huge. If you want it to last, invest in quality hardware, use it gently, and check the screws or brackets every now and then to keep everything tight. A little care goes a long way with furniture that has moving parts.

In short, it’s not that lift-top ottomans are unreliable—it’s that people often buy the wrong type for how they use it. Treat it like a mechanical piece of furniture instead of just a storage box, and it’ll serve you well for a long time.",1,1762780355.0,BedroomLab,0,1.0,False

I barely learned anything new from CS50 (some of it was covered in the individual subjects I was allowed to go to already) and it's not even close to being enough for a career for a gifted person. Plus it's isolated and boring. Essentially if fixes NONE of my problems. Also neither CS50 nor the study credit I earned from individual subjects will lead to exemption for subjects in university so basically that means I wasted an entire year and tons of college tuition on nothing. I'm gonna have to go through the same stuff for the third time in university, if this is true I'd rather not bother. And I have to deal with maths and travelling. This pissed me off so hard I became more determined to convince my coach again. Initially I was motivated to do CS50 and math but now I pretty much don't care anymore. I just want to go to a real college instead, and ASAP. 

At this point I am just sick and tired of everything. If my coach won't give me another chance to fix my life at college, I am seriously considering putting an end of everything. I'm so tired of the ennui of being unable to work on my future or live up to the expectations that not only my parents, but society as a whole put on me, and being stuck spending over half of the day gaming and being stuck with my stupid family instead of making progress toward a bright future, sometimes I'm not even in the mood to game anymore, I just want to work on my CS degree. I seriously need to convince him but idk what to even do at this point anymore.

New my therapist wants to involve the entire family which I don't want bc I my father will not react to it well, he's the backbone of the family, he works his ass off and is the only family member who earns money and also does a lot of chores, he doesn't have time to teach us many life skills either and my mother also has to do a lot of chores while we're supposed to focus on studying, he can do something stupid like kick me out of the house, I don't wanna take the risk. My brother doesn't care about it either. They're focusing on this instead of more pressing matters like me needing a proper daily life and needing to become suitable enough for college. My coach told me he will let me back if my therapist says I'm suitable.

Sorry that this post got so damn long again but it can't be helped, it doesn't even touch upon most of my life experience before my college attempts so a lot of context is missing but trust me I tried to keep it short.",2,1762780353.0,AutisticAdults,0,0.75,False

for women in their 20s,  still figuring life out (and probably running on iced coffee) this age group loves useful but cute stuff. they want their daily chaos to look a little aesthetic.

* Stanley or Simple Modern Tumbler:  yes, it’s overhyped. yes, they still love it.
* Glossier You / Phlur Missing Person: smells like effort without screaming perfume.
* Papier planner / Notion: upgrade for pretending we have our lives together.
* Aesop hand balm: tiny luxury energy. smells like I have taste. For women in their 30s, busy, tired, and craving calm these gifts hit when someone’s juggling a job, maybe kids, maybe just life.
* Our Place Always Pan 2.0: pretty and practical.
* Hatch Restore 2: a slow, soft way to wake up.
* Cuyana Tote: looks expensive, lasts forever.
* Dior Lip Glow Oil:  the 5-second confidence boost.

for women in their 40s–50s  comfort, quality, and no clutter please they’re over trends. they just want nice things that make sense.

* Brooklinen sheets or Parachute robe:  cozy core unlocked.
* Le Labo Discovery Set:  smells grown but fun.
* Photo book / recipe journal:  nostalgia always wins.
* Kindle Paperwhite: endless books, zero bookshelf drama.

for women 60+  comfort and connection this group loves gifts that feel thoughtful. not pricey, just personal.

* Weighted blanket or Barefoot Dreams throw: soft, warm, relaxing.
* Custom photo calendar or Aura frame:  they will cry.
* Fancy tea + kettle set (Fellow, Smeg):  quiet joy.
* Something handmade:  scarf, recipe box, card. old-school hits different.

honestly, best gift for women just means something that says i noticed this would make your day easier or happier. Let me know if u guys have more suggestions, i’ll keep adding to this list.",1,1762780324.0,u_Ambitious-Map5299,0,1.0,False
1otdd4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1otdd4v/metatopia_report/,Metatopia Report,"I went to Metatopia for the first time this past weekend and it was an incredibly valuable experience that I highly recommend to anyone that can make it in the future, and I absolutely plan on going again next year.

**What is Metatopia?**

Metatopia is a convention specifically aimed at table top game designers, especially TTRPGs and board games. Almost everyone that goes is a designer, almost all of whom have brought a game to playtest. Most games are tested in two hour blocks, with the last 20-30 minutes of each session usually devoted to feedback. 

**What did I playtest?**

First one I want to mention is *Scroll & Steel* by our very own u/DBones90, a PBTA inspired fantasy adventure game with a very cool way of generating a tangled web of supporting characters. Out of all the playtests I did this is the only one where we all got immediately invested in the story and wanted to know more, an impressive feat in only one hour of play. I also really like the spellcasting techniques my character had (as everyone knows, I have a [lifelong dream of being a wizard](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/s/UCOiL9fFe9)) 

Oh, also in this playtest group: Meguey Baker, co-author of *Apocalypse World*. It must be absolutely nerve wracking to playtest your PbtA inspired game for the creator of PbtA but DBones90 kept their cool. It's the TTRPG equivalent of Stephen King reading and giving you notes on your horror novel.

The other stand out for me was a game called *Bottle Episode*. The premise is that you are playing characters in an episode of a TV series that takes place entirely in a single location. You each write down secrets on index cards which can then be revealed during the session to get a bonus on a check, one secret your character has been keeping from the others, and one secret about another character. Super fun session and the secrets mechanic worked great! Ali Mark of [Spilled Coffee Creatives](https://share.google/RYcPHa7WINH8tvspt) might be the most talented GM I've ever met, she has a very strong grasp on pacing which is probably the single most difficult GM skill to pick up.

Other games I tested included:

* *For the Badge*, a Football/Soccer game that uses a system inspired by *Dream Askew, Dream Apart* to tell stories both on and off the pitch. If you want to play a game that can feel like *Ted Lasso*, this is that game. 
* *Guardians of the Six Realms*, which captures the feeling of combat in a JRPG, and has great enemy forecasting.
* And a couple of fantasy heartbreakers that I would be hard pressed to describe in any more detail. 

**Why did I think it was so valuable?**

I learned an absolute ton about playtesting, both from what worked well, and what not to do from a few mistakes I witnessed. 

* Make sure you leave time for feedback! In one playtest the designer was so focused on finishing up the adventure they didn't leave themselves any time for feedback. Meanwhile, DBones90 had a timer running to make sure there was time left for feedback. 
* Don't defend your game. It's a waste of time, literally, since you are doing that instead of receiving more feedback, and you aren't there to convince one person that actually, that mechanic is working as intended. Jot down what they say and move on. 
* Don't ask leading questions. If you ask a playtester what was the most confusing part, they will tell you what they think might be the most confusing part, *even if they weren't confused by it*, because they want to help you by answering your questions. 
* Have material ready that showcase the mechanics you want to test, so that you can jump right to the action immediately. If you want to playtest a dragon fighting system, have the players start at the entrance to the dragon's lair, not in the village questioning the blacksmith if anything of interest has been happening. *In media res* are words to live by in playtesting.
* Learn how to accurately describe your game. You want to get playtesters that are interested and knowledgeable in games like your's. Eventually you will need to be able to do this for customers as you want the players that will enjoy your game to purchase it.
* Watch for trends. Any given piece of feedback could just be one person's opinion...but if you are receiving the same feedback over and over, there is a reason for that. 
* This might have been a fluke because it feels weird to type, but make sure your GMing style matches your game. I was in one very crunchy playtest where the GM was running everything by vibes. I tried to offer feedback on how it didn't feel satisfying to manage character resources when you couldn't predict the results, which they deflected by saying that was just their GMing style, not a property of the game. I imagine most people, like I do, are going to assume you are running your game the way you intend it to be run. 

**What else was there?**

Lots of panels and seminars. I went to one about how to run playtests, and one on creating diagrams of your mechanics' interactions with each other. Meguey and D. Vincent Baker held one on the underlying models their games are designed on that I wish I caught.

**Some things to know before you go**

Dress in layers. I didn't personally experience it but I'm told by others that one of the ballrooms was fluctuating between hot enough to cause sweating, and cold enough to make you wish you had a jacket on.

A lot of the people at Metatopia have been going for years, and already know people there. If you don't feel comfortable going up to a group of strangers, introducing yourself, and inviting yourself to join their conversation it feels a little like transferring to a new school half way through the year. I didn't mentally prepare myself for this, I ended up by myself most of the time when I wasn't in a panel/playtest, so learn from my mistakes by being ready to put yourself out there in the lobby. I wish I had but I wasn't comfortable doing that. 

**Conclusion**

Metatopia has inspired me to buckle down and work on my WIP. I am fired up to run some playtests of my own so I am going to make sure I am ready for next year. An actual deadline is just what I need to motivate me.",9,1762780318.0,RPGdesign,3,1.0,False
1otdcxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoulsSliders/comments/1otdcxl/are_you_searching_final_end_of_all_knowledges/,are you searching final end of all knowledges,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I recently started Latuda again (half of an 18.5 mg tablet) for BPD. Honestly, it’s one of the few meds that actually makes me feel normal. For the first time in a long while, I feel like I can live a relatively stable life. I’ve struggled since childhood with rumination, anxiety, and depression, and nothing else has really helped like this.

The thing is, this is my second time trying Latuda. The first time I took it for about 15 days, but I stopped because I developed a hand tremor, especially noticeable when drinking my morning coffee. Now, I’m in such a deep depression that my psychiatrist decided we should try it again — but this time, with an added Parkinson’s medication to help manage potential side effects.

It’s only been a week, and I already feel much better mentally, but the hand shaking still worries me.

He said it’s evaporated with cooking but we can inform them so they can make sure that’s the case when preparing our food. Server essentially said the same thing. I was like “great, just wanted to make sure”.

Dinner was fine, food okay. Fast forward to dessert. I saw they had espresso and would like to have it with dessert but it was 7 PM and I didn’t want to be up all night from the caffeine. So I asked the server if they have decaf espresso. Her response was “I didn’t give up caffeine when I was pregnant”. Told her “I didn’t either” and explained I don’t want to be up all night. She made a joke about how baby will be moving around in my belly after drinking the coffee. Yeah, not funny, I want to get some sleep.

I swore I wouldn’t write to you again. Yet, here I am. I don’t know if its the time of year, or if its because it's close to another year on this planet for me but every… single… day I think of you. Without fail. I CANNOT get you out of my head. And I feel I need to say something or I’am going to go insane.

Its been almost 2 years since we ended. For the umpteenth time. And not a day has gone by where I don't think about you. Not. A. Single. Day. 

Every day I reminisce of the things we did, the memories we made. Every day I long and miss you. Every day I imagine what it would be like to send you this song, watch this show with you, go to the gym together or spend a Sunday morning sleepily sipping coffee at whatever shop is close by.

You know, I was genuine when I said this wasn't it for us, and that I will keep that line open to you. But I had to unfollow you on IG, despite you blocking me for your own space and healing of which I totally approve and understand, because I kept on checking if I was still blocked. That hurt me. And I totally deserved it. And I don't for a second pretend my pain supersedes your healing.

I don't for a second pretend to deny my fault in the reasons we failed. I was mentally unhealthy, I was emotionally unhealthy and I took you for granted. I know you know all these things too, just how much pain I was in and how that bled into you, and how my destructive behaviour destroyed us.

Therapy was tough because it just made me realise how much I failed you, and how much I failed myself. I refused to advocate for myself, I refused to tell you what I wanted to say that I didn’t even realise you needed to hear. I should have said “I love you, I want to be with you, and despite whatever this math may say - we will make it work”. I wanted then to be with you, I wanted to go through that struggle with you. I wanted to have our space together, our dates together and our life together. But - I shot that dream.

You know, I always hoped you would reach out. I think I cling to that cause I know you were the person I wanted to be with. Someone who I found I truly loved and could see a future with.

I burned that future to the ground, I don’t deserve reprieve nor do I deserve you.

I don't have any hope in sending this somehow fixes us or me. I don't expect you to forgive me either. I just hope that me saying this that I can voice my feelings for you and put that energy out there.

This is gonna sound dumb but I just realized I put way more effort into posts that strangers see than stuff i send to my actual friends

like i'll spend 15 minutes editing a photo for instagram, picking the right caption, making sure everything looks good... for what? people i went to high school with who I haven't talked to in years?

But then my best friend asks me for a book recommendation and i just text her """"idk the one with the blue cover lol""""

Or I'll have these whole thoughts about life and advice and observations sitting in my notes app but i never share them with anyone. not online, not with friends, just... sitting there. but I'll post a photo of my coffee to my story without thinking twice about it

I think its because the stuff that actually matters feels more vulnerable? like a photo of my coffee can't really be judged but if i share actual thoughts someone might think they're stupid

Also theres something weird about how we communicate now. Like I have deeper """"conversations"""" with random people on reddit than i do with some of my irl friends because here I can just say what im actually thinking without worrying about how it'll affect our relationship or whatever

Does anyone else do this? spend more energy on content for strangers than on actual meaningful communication with people you care about?

idk maybe im just chronically online but it feels backwards. the stuff I share publicly is the least important stuff about my life and the things that actually matter i just... don't share

* Motion sensor in the hallway
* Pressure mat by my bed
* Voice-activated commands

The system was supposed to: detect me getting out of bed → start brewing → have coffee ready when I reached the kitchen.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I’m getting tired of this. Is it all in my head and is everyone shedding like this after washing? Been experiencing increased hair shedding since may. I weaned my baby in march when she was six months old. I thought that I was going bald back in 2023 for a whole year before I got pregnant but the hair shedding was not like this.
Is this an ok amount for three days without washing? My hair is a bit below my shoulders.
I brush my hair in between washes so it’s not ALL the strands from three days. I can’t go bald like there is no way, it will ruin my life. I don’t understand why there are so many strands coming out while brushing through after washing! I thought it was getting better for a couple of washes and I didn’t shed much in between washes but now it’s back again I think.

1otcxzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthicalNonMonogamy/comments/1otcxzf/aita_things_turned_romantic/,AITA - Things turned romantic?,"6 months ago, I asked my wife to open our relationship. 

For context: I’ve been doing online sex work for many years, years before we even met. She has always known this. I have some friends I have made through sw who helped me realize that there were kinky things that I wanted to experience that my wife was not interested in or comfortable with. 

I asked if I could seek a partner who I could do those things with. I have always been the type of person who could separate romance and sexuality, so I wasn’t worried about catching feelings, as that was a boundary she wanted to set. My wife was worried about me meeting someone and leaving her for them. I assured her that she would always be my priority. We had many discussions and both started seeing ENM-affirming therapists so we could make a fully educated decision.

We ultimately agreed that I could find a friend with benefits situation. So I did. Over the next few months, I saw several different people and had a few good experiences, but none of them stuck long-term. Meanwhile, I encouraged my wife to also seek a friend with benefits situation if she wanted to. So she did. She went for coffee with someone and has been seeing her ever since. 

At first I was happy that she had found someone. It made me feel less guilty about my own search. But then I started noticing her putting more energy into her dates and interactions with her fwb than with me. I brought this up and things got better for a bit. But then I started struggling with my own self-esteem and self-worth because my search was at a stand-still. We discussed how we had never agreed to either of us entering into a romantic relationship and how that was her fear for me in the beginning. I think it helped her realize that I was beginning to feel uncomfortable with her relationship. 

She had an overnight planned for one weekend and I said she could go to that because it was already paid for, even thought I wasn’t in a great place mentally. I had a miserable night alone, but put on a brave face for her. When she returned, I said that I was not comfortable with overnights for the time being. She agreed…but went on to say that she realized during this overnight that they had developed deeper feelings for one another than expected. She said that she predicted that I was going to say that she needed to step back and that they got emotional when they talked about it. She said she didn’t want to keep this from me and that I deserved to know. 

To say that I was crushed is an understatement. I immediately started to doubt everything that she had told me about this person and her feelings towards her. I feel less confident in our relationship and like she’s only staying with me because she feels like it’s the right thing to do. She said that she will always choose me and that I am her priority, but she can’t deny her feelings for the other person. I asked if she loved her and she said no, but that she could one day.

So the question is…am I an asshole for asking her to end things with this other person? I cannot remain in a relationship where she’s in a romantic relationship with another person. I am feeling incredibly betrayed and am unsure if I even want our relationship to be open anymore. I know I asked for this in the first place and that it’s all my fault, but I still feel like this was a breach of trust. Advice?",1,1762779185.0,EthicalNonMonogamy,3,1.0,False

**Decaf Summer '24** -

Bumped into this subreddit after an insane anxiety episode one afternoon after drinking second cup of coffee of the day during work. I had been drikning a cup of coffee for past 1-2 years consitently every morning. After reading all the accounts here, I commited the day itself to go off caffiene.


**The bads:**

* First 2 weeks had a hard time focusing on anything at work for more than 2-5 mins. Strange. And that's when I realized the grip caffeine had one me and made my resolve to quit even stronger. 
* First 2 weeks sleep was all over the place, some nights really great, some not. But I knew this coming so I let it happen.
* First few months, my mood was irritable, angry, lazy and confused sometimes, but not all the time. I don't know when it got fixed and how.
* First month, I couldn't motivate myself to engage in any of my hobbies like reading a book, writing. 


**The goods:**

* I committed to go to gym everday and made some decent gains. Because caffeine was making me eat less of the food I should have eated in the first place as breakfast and snacks.
* after a month or so, sleep got better, deeper and it was easier to fall asleep.
* after a month people started mentioning a glow on my face which probably was the hydration effect(coffee was making my face look dull and dry as it dehydrates you)
* I found it easy to give up other vices of smoking/vaping wihtout coffee 
* After a month or so I was consitently having more stable energy throughout the day and was super productive at work
* I did't need any external stimulation to be happy, this was the biggest take, no coffee or tea or cig to feel myself, live and enjoy any moment or social situations
* After a month, I started enjoying eating and cooking a lot more than before. I was motivated to try to cook new different meals.
* I started noticing how cranky, anxious and ill people act/talk after they drink coffee. Makes me think I must have been like that before when drinking.
* Everything became more enhanced and intense, personal feelings, emotions and expressions.
* Started having more vivid dreams.

**Back to caffeine(tea) - Winter '24**

Went home in India for some family time. Most my friends and family there are big on tea, so started drinking again for giving company. Apprently the tea there is less caffeinated than in the West(from my personal experience) as I didn't feel any of the bads much. After my vacation I never drank coffee(I started hating the taste of it). But I still drank tea for a few months switching to decaf tea for a couple of months.

**Decaf Summer '25**

Although I wasn't anxious or facing any bads, but I was got used to drinking tea for getting productive at work and faced trouble sleeping quicly at night. So I gave up tea again.
Surpisingly there was less of the  bads this time! I didn't face extreme withdrawals. Few days of low mood and energy but I started breathworks around this time and it was super helpful and healing.
All the good which I felt lacking a bit returned very quicly, even with more extra good bits due to breathwork.

**Experiences of drinking coffee a couple of times:**

Although I started hating the taste of coffee after I quit. I had caf/decaf latte(with some syrup) 2-3 times since last year. 

Effects: 

* When I am in social situation, I become super cranky to talk a lot more. Its hard for me to stop then. And my friends are afraid of me if I drink coffee because I go non-stop chatter. But it was all a funny episode!
* When I am alone, I get this very anxious and existential questions around life and myself. I go in that rabbit hole till I remember, ah, it must be the coffee and once its gone from the system I am back to normal.


**My tips and advice for a smoother ride of withdrawals:**

* Breathwork did wonders for bringing back energy levels up when I went decaf for the second time. I recommed Breathe with Sandy on Youtube.
* Give your body and mind rest, know that you might not get proper sleep at night, try taking naps during the day
* Take it easy on yourself while it takes a while to get back to same productive levels and even better.
* Exercise/gym/any physical activity helps with the energy level and confidence
* Someone here mentioned drinking warm water helps, and I think it does, even if not warm, drinking more water in general


**How I look at coffee now?**

Its a scam and a drug. I love the decaffinated version of me more than caffeinated . A lot also falls to our personalities, habits, lifestyle we are having before, during and after the phases. But once you feel the bliss, peace and leisure of your days without coffee it would be hard to go back for it.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

Realized afterwards that the device seems to be bent, and there's a shocking amount of noticeable internal pressure - I suspect either the battery swelled, or the construction of these devices is just... faulty. I've had this device for a few weeks, and it spent that entire time in a case with a screen protector. I got mine secondhand, so it's *plausible* that the previous owner took it apart and put it back together wrong, but I frankly doubt it, given Boox's apparent track record with these kinds of problems.

It’s like self care for your body and mind.

Think about it… you probably spend the same on a weekend lunch, a night out, a visit to the mall, or even a few cups of coffee in a week.Even the impulsive online shopping you do when there is a sale.

Now, imagine spending that same energy and money on your body and mind.A single session can leave you lighter, calmer and more focused -  not just for an hour, but for days.

A professional spa is like a mini-investment in yourself.
It helps relieve stress and tension, boosts your mood and energy, and if sleep has been tricky lately it can help you sleep better too.

It’s basic maintenance - just like oiling your vehicle, charging your phone, or filling your tank.Except here, it’s your body and mind getting the care they need.

So the next time you hesitate thinking “it’s too much,” remember - you’re already spending the same on things that vanish in an hour.

Why not spend it on feeling better instead ?. 

But if you can't afford one, self care doesn't always have to come with a bill. Pause, breathe and treat yourself to something nice. ",0,1762778093.0,BangaloreSocial,1,0.4,False

A bit about me: I enjoy books, music, long walks, and trying out new cuisines. I'm emotionally mature, respectful, and value genuine connections. Ideally, I'm looking to meet someone  who shares similar interests and is open to building a friendship that could grow into something deeper.

Leaving a big rock by the fire until it’s as warm as a cup of fresh coffee is great for preheating your sleeping bag or drying wet boots.  An opaque nalgene with a headlamp strapped to it inside out is a perfect light source for your tent.

1otcaqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoloTravel_India/comments/1otcaqx/complete_travel_guide_to_puducherry_pondicherry/,Complete Travel Guide to Puducherry (Pondicherry),"Sharing my experience from our family trip to Tamil Nadu, covering Puducherry, also known as Pondicherry.

Pondicherry, officially Puducherry, is the capital and most populated city of the Union Territory of Puducherry, India. Located on the southeast coast, it’s surrounded by the Bay of Bengal on one side and Tamil Nadu on the other, sharing much of its culture, heritage, and language with the state.

Puducherry is connected by a railway branch line from the five-way junction at Viluppuram and Chennai, by Air and by Road to major Indian cities.

**Getting Around**

We rented two vehicles for local travel from this [rental place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4ocUMX6nnYNSCMa89). You can easily book online through [GoBikes](https://gobikes.co.in/) or find many offline providers near the railway station. Offline is recommended.

* Cost: ₹300–₹400 per scooter per day (depending on type)
* Duration: 2 days
* Total Paid: ₹1400 for two scooters (no deposit, no distance limit)

Renting is highly recommended - it’s cheaper, convenient, and gives you full freedom to explore.

If you’re traveling by train, Puducherry Railway Station has a cloakroom where you can store luggage temporarily.

We stayed at [La Courtyard](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZmHeNM6vxzwv8RFE7) Hotel, suitable for four people. It’s a little away from the city center, but worth the price and comfort. Also, it's near serenity beach so you can experience sunrise at morning at less crowded beach.

**Wheather**

Even in **October–November**, Puducherry feels quite hot. Carry an umbrella and avoid going out during the afternoon. You can plan indoor visits during that time such as:

* [Sri Aurobindo Ashram](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K9eRqF1x3Y3aaqQr7)
* [Puducherry Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/neHwMkodCD1Y7Tnk8)

**Main Attractions**

* [Paradise Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jhHiNuKgrDQTJ8ou7)
* [Eden Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TeRHPz54NibCD38P9) \- One of India’s 18 **Blue Flag** certified beaches. It’s clean, peaceful, and less crowded.
* [Marina Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/781eb5BjFNEmxN7X9) \- Ideal for evening visits with good food stalls and dinner options.
* [Promenade Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gqVpqtKPxYYfo9df6)
* [Rock Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hdndU46We6VwN4577)
* [Serenity Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHfMcxs6mqsg85TG7)

All beaches are somewhat similar, with minor differences in soil color and surroundings. Each has its own vibe, but the overall experience is quite similar. Personal Opinion.

Most beaches have **police surveillance at night**, which feels safe, but still practice general caution.

* [White Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/66Ey4TxZaE2C6MVQ9) \- It is the French colonial area filled with colorful streets and heritage buildings. We explored it on our scooters, since it’s too large to cover on foot. Morning is the best time to visit - you can enjoy the sunrise at a nearby beach, return to freshen up to your stay, get ready, and then explore White Town for great photo spots.
* [Sacred Heart Basilica](https://maps.app.goo.gl/byjBFqfQNaU2xAzT8) \- Beautiful church showcasing Gothic architecture, a must-visit landmark.
* [Lighthouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z7LHbCFkamdRLvYs6) \- Usually open for visitors to view the entire city from above. When we visited, it was closed for maintenance, but it’s definitely worth checking out. Check timing.
* [Auroville Village & Matrimandir](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xQXU3mMpkwq3r366A) \- It is about **15 km** from the city center. It’s an international township known for peace, sustainability, and creativity. The main attraction is the **Matrimandir**, the golden globe structure often seen in photos. Visitors can see it from a distance unless they have a **pre-booked pass** for entry into the **Inner Chamber**. You can find booking details [here](https://auroville.org/page/concentration-in-the-matrimandir-inner-chamber).

The area is large, and vehicles are not allowed for visitors inside, so expect a lot of walking. You can also explore local art galleries, exhibitions, and shops to learn more about the Auroville community.  
Even during the afternoon, it feels cooler here, but mornings are still the best time to visit.

**Other Tips**

* You’ll often find locals (especially in White Town) offering **boat rides** through mangrove forests. Prices range from ₹400–₹800 per person. Negotiate for a good deal.
* You can **rent bicycles** for short distances, especially around Rock Beach and White Town. It costs about ₹100 per day, and rentals are easily available near the railway station.
* For authentic local food, check out this [Reddit post with restaurant recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/pondicherry/comments/1lt1578/my_list_of_goto_food_places_in_pondy/).

**My personal favorite:** [Indian Coffee House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ieL7d4SoHqbPp5sg7).

It’s a vintage South Indian restaurant known for its authentic food and nostalgic vibe. You’ll see many locals reading newspapers over breakfast. It gets crowded, so go early in the morning.

Two days are enough for families or solo travelers to cover most places in Puducherry comfortably.

1otcagq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1otcagq/how_to_stack_habits_so_you_dont_rely_on_motivation/,How to stack habits so you don’t rely on motivation,"Everyone loves to talk about motivation. You know the vibe—those viral videos urging you to grind harder, wake up at 5 AM, and manifest your dream life just by thinking about it harder. It’s seductive, but also exhausting. What nobody tells you is that motivation is wildly unreliable. One week you’re meal-prepping and reading Marcus Aurelius, and the next you’re bingeing Netflix and eating cereal for dinner. It’s not your fault. It’s how the brain works. So if you’ve ever struggled to stay consistent, you're not lazy—you’re working against your default settings.

That’s why this post is about something that’s actually sustainable: habit stacking. Based on behavioral science, not social media myths. Everything here is pulled from legit research, bestselling books, and the best psychology creators on YouTube and podcasts. No fluff. Just practical brain hacks to rewire your habits—even when motivation is dead on arrival.

Let’s start with a reality check. According to research from the University College London, it takes an average of 66 days for a new behavior to become automatic. That sweet “it’s just what I do now” status. Motivation might get you to day three. Habit architecture is what carries you to day 66 and beyond. James Clear, in his bestseller “Atomic Habits,” breaks this down brilliantly: we don’t rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems. Habit stacking is that system.

The basic idea? You attach a new habit to something you’re already doing. Your brain loves patterns. You brush your teeth, then you journal. You boil water for your coffee, then you do five push-ups. Tiny connections build powerful chains. This principle builds off B.J. Fogg’s behavior model from Stanford, which shows that behavior = motivation × ability × prompt. Habit stacking gives you the prompt.

But here’s what most people miss: it’s not just about WHEN you stack, it’s how easy and frictionless you make it. Dr. Wendy Wood, a leading habit researcher at USC, found that 43% of our daily behaviors are done without conscious thought. Your job is to make your desired habit slip into that unconscious groove.

Make it ridiculously easy first. Like “write ONE sentence in your journal” easy. The smaller the action, the lower the friction. You’re not trying to feel proud of yourself after, you’re trying to feel so unstressed by it that you just do it. This low-friction method is also what Nir Eyal emphasizes in “Indistractable.” He says motivation is overrated. What actually works is eliminating internal triggers like boredom or discomfort by designing environments that make focus frictionless.

Another trick: bundle habits with something pleasurable. This is called “temptation bundling,” coined by Dr. Katy Milkman from Wharton. She found that linking a habit with something enjoyable—like listening to your favorite podcast only while doing dishes—helps you stick to it way more consistently. It transforms the habit from a chore into a dopamine loop.

And speaking of dopamine, the neuroscience here is fascinating. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks a lot about how the dopamine system is more about anticipation than reward. That tiny thrill before you open Duolingo? That’s dopamine priming. You can hack this by using consistent cues (same playlist, same corner of your room, same mug) to build anticipation into your new habit. It literally trains your brain to crave it.

Now let’s talk about tools that make this easier and more fun.

**“Atomic Habits” by James Clear** is a must-read. It’s a #1 New York Times bestseller and has transformed millions of lives globally. James distills habit building into a system so clear it feels like cheating. What hit especially hard is how he writes about identity—every habit you perform is a vote for the kind of person you want to be. This book will genuinely change how you see yourself. If you're serious about behavior change, this is the best habits book ever written. No contest.

**“The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg** (Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist) breaks down the science of habit loops—cue, routine, reward. This book will make you notice your unconscious behaviors in real time. It’s an insanely good read if you want to understand why you keep doing stuff you don’t even enjoy—and how to change it without hating yourself.

**The Tim Ferriss Show podcast** is also stacked with conversations about micro habits. His episodes with B.J. Fogg and James Clear are packed with golden insights about how to reduce decision fatigue and build systems that work even on your worst days.

**Struthless** on YouTube, especially his video ""How to Build Your Life Operating System,"" is one of the best explainers on not relying on willpower. He breaks down how habit loops and identity come together in a way that’s easy to absorb and visually engaging.

**The Finch app** helps you gamify self-care and daily habit tracking by turning tasks into cute pet care. No shame in making growth fun. It works. People who feel emotionally rewarded are more likely to stick to routines.

**BeFreed** is a newer AI-powered learning platform built around this exact idea—replacing willpower with structure. What makes it really stand out is that it builds you a personalized learning plan from books, research, and real-world lessons based on your interests and goals. You can choose the tone and voice of your podcast host, and even how long you want your deep dives to be (10, 20, or 40 minutes). It learns from what you listen to and builds an adaptive roadmap for your growth over time. If you’re trying to stack learning as a daily habit, this makes it stupidly easy to stay consistent and curious. The best part? It covers every book mentioned in this post, along with thousands of others in psychology, productivity, and behavior change. It’s basically habit stacking for your brain.

You don’t need more motivational quotes. You need fewer decisions, less friction, more systems. That’s how change actually sticks.

Forget waiting for motivation. Bake your goals into your daily operating system. One habit at a time. One stack at a time.",1,1762777233.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

I’ve never furnished anything larger than a 10x10 ft. room before, so I’m honestly not sure where everything would look best or what my aesthetic would be called… but I’m excited to start with the living room!

So far, I have a cement dining table, a fake bamboo planter, and acrylic magazine rack that I picked up from fb marketplace. (Very serious when I say the only things I brought with me when I moved in was my mattress, some art magazines and a toothbrush.)

I compiled some living room furniture I’ve been looking at, and I’m curious to see what combinations you think would look nice and where they might go (e.g. A1 for sofa/coffee table combo). 

I have no rugs, lamps, or other decor in mind yet. Honestly, I appreciate any and all insight you have to give regarding these, from color/shape ideas to links.

Thanks so much for your time :)

1otc8cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/1otc8cl/help_me_understand_airflow_thermodynamic_in_this/,Help me understand airflow / thermodynamic in this context,"Hi guys,  
This is my first post in the sub, and I’m excited to talk with professionals in the field. A bit about myself — I’m not an expert or a physics student. Actually, I always get terrible marks in physics when I was in school. Now I’m just an ordinary coffee roaster who has been working in this field for about three years. But because of this job — and having to do my own reading to earn a better salary — I’ve realized that I really love science.

Most of my understanding of the laws of physics in coffee roasting comes from trial and error with different approaches. Other times, I learn from books, blogs, YouTube videos, or research articles about coffee. I thought I was good at my job, but I realized I wasn’t — because lacking a proper understanding of physics fundamentals really holds me back. None of my hands-on experience could answer the question: *“Why did this happen?”*

So, hopefully after I share the “system” inside my brain, we can discuss the topic together. Personally, I love reading any kind of critique because it helps me refine my skills.

What I’d love to discuss is the **mechanism of airflow in a closed environment** (in this case, a coffee roasting machine) — what happens physically when we apply heat, and how complex it can become.

I’ll break this topic into the following sections to make it easier to follow:

1. The coffee roasting machine – how I understand it from the manual book.
2. Physics terms I’ve encountered while learning.
3. My understanding of airflow from using the machine.

# 1. The Machine

The machine I’m working with is a Probat, made in Germany, and the model dates back to around 2014, so we can expect some technology inside. I’ve provided two images: [the first is a 3D mockup](https://i.postimg.cc/HL8mMbCt/3d-model.png) of what the machine looks like, and [the second is a process diagram](https://i.postimg.cc/WbYx7t84/procedureplan.png) from the manual.

From the second image, when D1 turns on, it brings in the flame and heats the R1 environment (the red area). This area is called the *drum*, which spins thanks to the motor marked in blue on the left. The yellow area, F1, is called the *cyclone*, and it sucks air through the orange pipeline out of the drum (R1).

When coffee beans are added from the hopper (B1), they enter the drum (R1). With the heat from the burner (D1) and the suction from the cyclone (F1), the beans roast through:

* Conduction (contact with the drum surface, which is made of cast iron)
* Convection (from the moving hot air)
* Radiation (emitted from the beans themselves)

For this roaster, I can control the heat level (from 0% to 100%) to manage roast time and environment temperature.  
In the middle of the orange area in the diagram, there’s a black line with a curved hook — that’s the damper. You can manually raise or lower it to adjust the airflow through the pipeline.

Compared with other brands that allow full control of the airflow (by changing cyclone fan speed) and drum rotation speed on-screen, this Probat model doesn’t have those features.

# 2. Physics Terms I’ve Gathered

During my time using the machine, I’ve come across some basic physics terms:

* Heat transfer: conduction, convection, radiation
* Airflow / ventilation

And some more advanced ones that I’ve recently encountered:

* Air pressure and velocity
* Fluid mechanics
* Thermodynamics
* Endothermic & exothermic reactions
* Entropy (no idea what this actually!)
* Bernoulli’s principle
* Venturi effect

Even though I can name these terms, that doesn’t mean I fully understand them — but I try to use them because my instinct tells me they’re important within the scope of my work.

# 3. What I Understand About Airflow from Using the Machine

When we heat the drum environment, we’re heating not only the drum material (cast iron) but also the air surrounding it. This Probat drum is designed with a double layer. The outer layer is in direct contact with the flame underneath, while the inner layer touches the coffee beans.

Since the drum keeps spinning, the beans are constantly being lifted and dropped, allowing enough contact time for conduction. The main driving force of heat transfer is the drum material itself (cast iron), which retains a lot of heat throughout the roast. Meanwhile, hot air flows from inside the drum, through the pipeline, and out through the cyclone to the chimney.

This machine only allows me to adjust heat level during production. I can’t change the drum speed or the cyclone fan speed, as both are fixed. So, I assume the airflow velocity remains steady throughout the process.

Then there’s the **damper**.  
When I close the damper to around **15% open**, the “air sound” around that pipeline area raises its pitch — it sounds like a hiss. When the heat reaches 90–100%, this hiss becomes much louder for a minute or two, then quiets down.

When I open the damper wider (around **45% open**), the hiss disappears and is replaced by a deeper, bass-like sound. So by adjusting the damper, it somehow affects the **air exhaust velocity** — where I believe Bernoulli’s principle and the Venturi effect might come into play — and therefore the **convection** inside the drum.

The manufacturer recommends setting the damper to around **40–45% open** throughout the roast, no less and no more. But being curious, I experimented by opening and closing it at different levels. Here’s what I observed and tried to make sense of:

* When the damper is **too narrow**, the heated air at the start of the roast (when the drum is preheated and the beans are at room temperature) produces that loud hiss — possibly due to increased pressure.
* When the damper is **more open** (around 30–45%), the sound shifts to a deeper tone, suggesting lower pressure.
* I’m not sure what exactly causes the loud hiss, but my theory is that narrowing the damper traps hot air in the drum, and when that air passes through the pipeline and hits the damper area, the pressure increases sharply. This might actually improve convection.
* Conversely, when I open the damper wider, the pressure seems to stabilize — but interestingly, the drum temperature appears **hotter**, which I can’t fully explain. Could it be that the airflow is moving slower? Shouldn’t it exhaust faster instead?

So, I expected that opening the damper wider would *lose* more convection heat, but instead, I observed that the **rate of temperature rise** increased. And when narrowing the damper, I thought it would *trap* more heat — but it didn’t behave that way. This Probat is often described as a heavy-conduction machine, rather than a more versatile conduction/convection type like some other brands. Because I haven’t been fully satisfied with the results I’ve been getting, I really want to understand more about hot air and how it works in the roasting process.

This is where I’m completely lost about how airflow really works — and I hope you guys can help me understand it better. Thank you so much for reading and make a reply to my thread.",3,1762777046.0,AskPhysics,0,1.0,False
