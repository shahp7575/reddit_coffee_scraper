1g1itmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g1itmt/do_you_consistently_find_the_tasting_notes/,Do you consistently find the tasting notes printed on the bag?,"My sense of smell is kind of muted--I can usually only smell strong smells and only up close. I've never gone to a doctor about it and since everyone's experience is subjective and unknowable, I'm not sure to what extent my sense of smell is abnormal. However, I am beginning to wonder if it is impacting my ability to taste the nuances of coffee.

In particular, I can rarely identify the tasting notes in washed coffees and I am wondering to what extent you all have the same experience? For example, I have been drinking a washed coffee from Sey that is supposed to taste like ""watermelon, white florals, and raspberry"". I don't get any watermelon and nothing floral. There is a pleasant raspberry-ish acidity to it and the coffee is bright and delicious; I just can't find most of those specific flavors in it.

I'm using a grinder (the ZP6) that is supposed to be optimized for clarity, and third wave water packets with distilled water. The latter two items (the grinder and the remineralized water) were recent introductions and definitely helped with clarity but I still don't get those flavor notes.

Do you all have similar experiences? How often can you find the flavor notes printed on a bag? How often are the flavors more like subtly akin to those notes but not really the same thing?",1,1728677247.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1g1is5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1g1is5z/1_week_postpartum_and_cant_stand_mil/,1 week postpartum and can't stand MIL,"I'm 8 days postpartum and feel like now that I've fulfilled my MIL's dream of providing her a grandchild, she's gone off the deep end. Here's what she's done in the last few days:

- from the beginning, I've stated that I want the first day of my child's life to be just my husband and myself. When we told her that the baby was born, she begged my husband to come up to see the baby. He had to scold her and tell her that I went through a medical event and that it was up to me when to allow visitors. But even with months of telling her the rules, she still couldn't stand that she wasn't in control. I eventually allowed my parents and her to come up about 18 hours after my surgery because I needed to see my parents. 

- My son's birth was rough. It was an emergency C section due to rapid heart deceleration. He was stuck in me and someone had to push him out with a hand up in me, they also needed a vacuum, and to make a T Shaped incision in my uterus to get him out. I could feel the pressure and sensation, and it wasn't fun. I'm now high risk and have to have C sections from now on, so I was upset and still trying to deal with this. I told my parents the details of the delivery, but we just told MIL that it was rough and difficult.  So she naturally asks when we would have a second child. I started sobbing and that made my incision hurt. 

- She bought gifts for us to the hospital. I've been very adamant about not having anything ""mom/mommy"" on it and i dont like cutesy stuff. I also don't care for the color pink. So she got me a pink coffee mug that says ""beautiful mommy."" She also got me socks for the hospital, that are pink, fuzzy, and clearly a slip hazard for tile floors...

- she got my son a ""my first 4th of July"" outfit that's 24 months. My husband pointed out that he'll be 9 months old then, she said that it'll just be a little big. I'm also going to be the one to pick out his ""firsts"" outfits.

- we have a rule to where we're the only ones who can post pictures of him online. I made the announcement and then she copied my post and pictures. Of course I saw this at 11 at night, she did take it down the next day, but still...

- she'll post 5 times a day how much she loves her grandchild, how he's the peanut butter to her jelly, and he's her whole world, etc. Yet she can't even correctly post when he's a week old, she declared that he was a week old today when that was yesterday.

All of this was on top of so many comments about when we were going to have kids, inappropriate comments made during my pregnancy, and her last minute baby shower that she had to throw when I was 9 months pregnant. I'm done with this woman. She now can't see what I post and I've blocked her number. Her anxiety and impulsiveness is too much for me, I strongly dislike that she will be in my child's life. She's going to have to get a hobby that is something other than my child, because I will not allow for her behavior to influence my son if I can avoid it. ",3,1728677133.0,JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,False

1g1irpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/bartenders/comments/1g1irpi/boulevardier_how_do_you_make_itwhat_is_it_really/,Boulevardier - How do you make it/what is it really made out of?,"When I first started bartending 2.5 years ago, I hated most traditional cocktails. Unfortunately like most bartenders, I’ve become somewhat of an alcoholic and so now I actually enjoy the taste of more traditional drinks (I.e. not just green teas, margs, lemon drops, mules, etc) I can enjoy old fashioned’s now. But Negronis are still pure evil to me and most non sweet martinis. So I made a Negroni once, but better in my opinion, with bullit and aperol instead of gin and Campari. 

I did this for a few reasons, the main one being, gin, ew. The second, Campari, also ew. Just way too bitter and no flavors I picked up on other than ‘dry’ and ‘ethanol’. I did some medium-heavy research and came to a conclusion that Aperol and Campari are the same shit. They are both described as Italian, bitter, liqueurs, and herbal/botanical. Which makes sense why they get paired with gin so often. But then my research led me to see that both are technically Amaros and Apéritifs. 

Mind you, I’m a 25 year old stoner who is an event bartender for upscale weddings with a bar that’s basically a real bar but not quite. Once I saw Amaro, my mind went straight to amaretto, and I love Amaretto sours but man, I know amaro and amaretto are not the same. Or are they? (This paragraph is here for you to understand my knowledge/skill level/gap/ lack of). 

Anyways, equal parts bourbon, aperol, and sweet vermouth led me to making my first ever boulevardier on a slow day. My fellow bartender that day told me I made a boulevardier, and that using whiskey is what makes it that compared to gin. So I drank a little and noticed how much I really liked it. But then the next week, a couple gets married and one of the specialty drinks was the boulevardier. That recipe was just Campari, Bullit, vermouth. Not a ton of guests liked it though because they thought it was too boozy and too bitter. So I made a couple people my version and they liked it way more. They asked me what it was called and I just said “a better boulevardier” because I have no clue what to call it… since apparently in the bartending world, if you change one ingredient, all of a sudden it’s something else completely and and it’s frowned upon to give it the same name as the drink it’s an offshoot of. 

Like if you were to add any amount of baileys or use regular brewed coffee instead of a literal espresso shot, you apparently can’t call it “espresso martini” even though nobody is gonna taste a difference. (You’re still getting that brown caffeinated vodka drink you ordered in a coup glass with beans on top and foam). So like…. Out of fear, I go into google and type in “what’s a cocktail made out of bourbon, aperol, and sweet vermouth?” & “what’s in a boulevardier” & “what’s a boulevardier with aperol instead of Campari called?” I would get recipes with Campari listed instead of aperol and couldn’t find one with aperol instead unless it was called a sunset boulevardier, and then I went and typed in “sunset boulevardier recipe” and got more hits with just regular ass boulevardier recipes. Not including aperol. Leaving me stumped. Why is this so hard to figure out? Is there a name for what I made that I just can’t find? Should I just give it my own name? Give me century old mixology textbook level technicalities and also give me realistic modern day non pretentious dive bar level brain responses, please and thank you.",1,1728677099.0,bartenders,0,1.0,False

1g1ipus,https://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/1g1ipus/computer_crashes_home_internet/,Computer Crashes Home Internet,"So ive run into this issue and im struggling to find anyone who has something similar. 

My 2080ti Hybrid crapped out a couple weeks ago. So in the interim, i took the wifes old 1080ti. The swap went fine. My old PC components are as follows 

MSI MPG Z390 

Corsair Vengeance 32gb 288-pin DDR4 2666

Intel core i9-9900K coffee lake

Corsair HX1000 PSU

EVGA GeForce 2080Ti Hybrid

After i swapped the 1080ti into my PC, it started crashing the house internet. Never seen a computer crash the internet for the entire house. I tried both wifi and hardline. Checked my network adapter drivers. Did a quick update and it...somewhat came out of it? I could get it to work but if i shut my pc down instead of just putting it to sleep, i was rolling the dice on the internet crashing. To get around it, i could just restart over and over and eventually, once it got it right, i was good to go. At this point, i assumed it was a motherboard issue. I had already planned on building a new pc anyways and had parts on the order. So i got my new pc parts and put it together. These parts are as listed.

ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E Gaming

Intel Core i9-12900K 12th Gen Alder Lake

Corsair Vengeance 64gb 288-pin DDR5 6000

Corasir HX1500i PSU

MSI gaming GeForce RTX 4090

I booted my pc up last night after the build and same issue. Crashing the whole house. 

Describing my house wifi, our company went to this ""nest"" style system that i hate. It has a modem that single ports out to a puck that is plugged into the wall. There are two more pucks around the house that tether to the first. There is ONE port for LAN on the first puck. 

These are my current symptoms (which were the same between both pc builds). When i boot up, the house wifi will crash if im connected. After many failed attempts to connect to the house, i connected to my phone hotspot and it worked flawlessly. I took this opportunity to update some drivers and check for updates off my hotspot. After a few updates i tried it again and it worked. I did some more updates and restarted the pc and it crashed again. So i stole the LAN cable from the wife and it didnt work. I went back to wifi and restarted the pc and then it worked. This problem seems to only apply to my computer. The smart tv's, smart phones, nintendo switch, my wifes computer, none of those affect the internet. Just my computer. Both old and new, regardless if im running it on wifi or LAN. My next step would be to reach out to the internet company for assistance but i really feel like this is a me problem, not them.

28F, 108lb 5ft, very athletic and active person. I have very low visceral fat, and body fat, so not the ""typical"" presentation of T2, with a 6.3 A1C. No LADA from what they've detected as the doctor was astounded when she saw these results.

I am at my WITS END with the fatigue I've been experiencing. I have to take at least one 1-2 hour long nap every day. Like, every cell in my body just shuts down. Yesterday I took an hour nap around 11 am, and then a FOUR HOUR nap from 3-7 pm. I am basically a non functioning human in society right now, the fatigue is debilitating and the main reason I went to the doctor, who claims its a compounded effect of a vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance/prediabetes. All my other blood results were perfectly normal!

I've switched my diet up substantially, eating all fruits and vegetables, high protein and low refined carb (bread, rice, desserts D:, etc. ). I do cheat here and there but have been extremely mindful since the reality check at the doctors the other week. I have also eaten a primarily plant based diet for almost 10 years. While I am very physically fit and still able to perform my athletic abilities at a high level (so thankful for this), I am so mentally and physically exhausted through the day and can barely get anything done at work, and I hate it. No matter how much I sleep at night, through the day, ever, I can't shake the fatigue!!!! I am literally almost comatose by mid afternoon, and I can't fight it with coffee, walking, cold showers/air, nothing. I have to just accept it or I will fall asleep sitting at my desk.

Anyone else have experience with this kind of fatigue on their pre-diabetes journey? This is outrageous and ruining my life!!!!!!!

1g1i7yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1g1i7yb/for_the_weakminded/,For the weakminded. ,"Long rant: 

I see that some people here asking ""for advice"" are only doing so to perpetuate the feeling of victimhood, wich disguises a lack responsibility for one's life, and when you give some real and sincere input to try to help them they downvote you. 

I come from the caribbean countryside... suffered sexual, emotional and physical abuse growing up, some months we did not had electricity and the only thing we had to eat were plantains... in a wooden house with a metal plank roof that had leakage when it rained and our beds got wet... roaches and bats got inside our house regularly and i had to go and work the coffee fields when i was 7 waking up early morning (4am), used to get daily beatings because i was a bad kid with adhd and was always getting in trouble. My first real job i got it at 16. 

I battled with depression when i turn into my 20s and had suicidal thoughts every single day... but i never had a victim's mindset and that is what helped me get through all of it and come on top... english is not my first language. I came to United States and made a life.... and the truth is, i did not even had it that hard compared to people from other countries......  

It frustrates me seeing a lot of people having all this mental issues living in literally the wealthiest country in the world with so many opportunities... so, take it as a vent, downvote it if you want, but here are some thoughts on the matter and this is just from life experience. 

-Truth hurts, and that is ok. Pain makes you change and learn, put your feelings to the side and try to see if there is something you can learn/take advantage from in every situation. 

-Feeling sorry for yourself won't fix anything.

-If you don't think like the main character/and can't think of yourself capable of doing what you want/need, NO ONE will do it for you. 

-The angel that will come and save you from your misery lives DEEP within yourself, is not outside waiting for you. 

-Outside of your closed ones, no one really cares about your feelings... or yourself, specially IRL. The same way you mostly care about you is the same way most other people live their lives, and that is ok. 

-If you have depression or anxiety, and think this is just the hand you were dealt... answer this questions and be honest...
1.Do you watch porn?
2.Do you eat healthy? 
3.Do you go out and take sunlight?
4.Do you workout?
5.Do you meditate? 
6.Are you thankful for what you have/who you have? 
7.Are you constantly working to better yourself? 
8.Do you have a relationship with God? (This one is personal)

Be honest with yourself.... you might be drowning in a cup of water.

And the last one, 

-ITS OK TO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH OTHERS, that is life!! Do not identify with your ideas and accept you might be wrong sometimes and learn from it, this will help you grow. Learn not to take shit personal, today you think one way, tomorrow you might be a whole different person. 

I know this post might get deleted, downvoted or whatever and i personally don't care. If this resonates with at least one other human being, that will be enough.

Sol, Galaxia, Serpent Saint, and Wolven Matriarch prepared for a potential encounter. The Rei and Noburu readied themselves, sensing presences surrounding them. The forest around them was eerily silent, the usual sounds of wildlife absent, replaced by an oppressive stillness.



“Stolen, hmmmm?” Furusu asked, his eyes scanning the treeline.



“Yes, those who Saikou has stolen his sigils from. They lose their regeneration and weakness to the sun, and instead gain Soul Sigils that cannot be robbed. They are directly in between being Executioners and Eternals. If they weren’t under Saikou’s control, who knows where they’d be…” Sol answered, his voice low and tense. “They possess white skin and holes in their chests.”



“That also means if we kill Saikou, the remaining Stolen will become Rei,” Galaxia added, her eyes narrowing as she sensed the approaching danger.



Suddenly, three Stolen appeared on the trees around them. A muscular one with no hair spoke first.



“Yarin, your sigil got us in quite a favorable position…” he said to an aloof, smiling Stolen.



“Well, if it weren’t for yours, Jitto, we’d have left our opponents waiting too long…” Yarin replied. “Well Sekka, now’s your cue.” A female Stolen with purple highlights in her hair and white horns seemingly teleported from a tree in front of Galaxia. She made a rapid slashing gesture, but Galaxia reacted swiftly, raising her arm to block the attack with a shimmering barrier of essence threads. The force of the blow sent a shockwave through the air, but Galaxia remained unscathed.



“Two Stolen are missing…” Sol said, his eyes darting around. “Shirogane, come with me. Galaxia and Furusu will take on the three here.” She nodded and ran with him. The Stolen let them go.



“As if they can beat Haji!” Jitto chuckled.



Galaxia tugged on the essence threads of the ground, but something pulled back, halting it. “This forest is resisting me…” she remarked, before her eye glowed. “I’ll have to leave it to my Keihatsu to let me control the environment.”



Furusu looked at Jitto, who was perched on a tree branch. He moved his sword in an upward slash, and the branch was severed. However, as if predicting his movement, Jitto side-hopped onto the ground.



“Hmmmm….your sword didn’t even touch the branch!” Jitto said, a smirk playing on his lips.



“Yes, my power is rather unique…my sword has an ‘imaginary’ piece of it that remains invisible but can materialize when I wish,” Furusu remarked. “And you must have foresight to have predicted such an attack,” he added.



“Spot on!” Jitto said, his eyes gleaming with excitement.



Furusu smirked. “Let’s see just how much you can predict with those eyes of yours…” he said, his voice filled with challenge.



As the tension in the air thickened, an ominous bird circled high above, its eyes glowing with a malevolent force. The bird’s presence went unnoticed by the group, but its gaze remained fixed on the Rei, a silent and sinister observer.



Meanwhile, Galaxia rushed at Sekka. She slashed at her, only for Sekka to disappear. Yarin smiled and snapped his fingers before Sekka reappeared in front of Galaxia, reaching to stab her gut. However, Galaxia kept her guard up and grabbed Sekka’s blade. “What just happened there…” she muttered. With her other arm, she dropped her blade and decked Sekka in the face, sending her flying back. She tugged at the essence threads of the air behind Yarin to push him towards her, only for him to suddenly appear back on the branch.



You can reverse time, can’t you, Yarin… Galaxia thought. Yarin jumped from the branch, his sword ready to slice Galaxia. They exchanged numerous blows, but whenever Galaxia landed a hit, Yarin managed to rewind time and undo the damage. Galaxia suddenly felt a sharp pain in her back. She turned and saw Sekka there.



“You can’t defeat us Stolen, one of us with the power to see time, one with the power to reverse time, and one with the power to skip time,” Yarin gloated with a smirk.



Galaxia got a glint in her eye, as if she were smiling under her cracked mask. “That’s a relief…I thought you Stolen were going to be stronger than me…”



Yarin’s smile faded. “Repeat that, Rei?”



“One of you can reverse time but only for one person at a time…the other of you can skip time, but that’s nearly the same as merely fighting a fast opponent…and the third can predict the future, but is fighting a rather unpredictable opponent…” she said. She suddenly faded away as if she were a painting washed away with water, revealing a backpack where she had been. Galaxia appeared behind Yarin and rapidly sliced his head off his shoulders.



“H-how?” Yarin gasped.



“I just manipulated the essence threads connected to light to make myself invisible for a moment, and made one of the Noburu’s packs look like me. I was worried it wouldn’t work as I did not have much time to conceal my presence and my decoy was rather imperfect and full of mistakes in my appearance, but with your cockiness and your constant reversal and skipping of time, it was possible to slip out and pull this off…” she said smugly.



Meanwhile, Furusu clashed with Jitto, who constantly managed to land blows on Furusu. Cuts slowly grew all over Furusu’s body. But it was Jitto who looked scared, as he began to sweat and pant.



Furusu smiled. “It doesn’t appear that looking into the future is doing you much good for your conscience…I wonder how many times I will make you see your own death. I’ll at least give you that you’re more experienced than those other two Stolen…they must have only had their powers recently,” Furusu said. Jitto gripped his blade tighter.



“Yes, I possessed a sigil that Saikou stole from me about a century ago. Those two are only about a decade old in terms of being Eternal…and I won’t forget that I’m the one currently winning this fight!” Jitto said with increased resolve, his mouth gaping in an eerie smile. He landed blows on Furusu with increased vigor before Furusu took a hop back. He picked up a pebble on the ground. “Ah, just what I needed.” He threw the pebble at Jitto, before Jitto was suddenly hit with a boulder. Furusu smiled. “Unlike you imbeciles, I don’t outright confirm my ability to the enemy.”



But suddenly, Yarin rewound himself and stood before Galaxia the same as he previously was. Jitto pushed the boulder off of him without a single injury.



“You think you can harm us on our own turf?” Jitto told Furusu. Yarin smiled at Galaxia, who was confused at him using his sigil beyond death. “You’re not just in any forest. You’re in our Dead Zone.”



As the battle intensified below, the malevolent energy in the bird’s eyes suddenly flickered and then extinguished. With a final, eerie glance at the scene below, the bird turned and flew away, disappearing into the distance.



…



Pride walked out to the clearing where Amaya and Kurayami Hana had been training. The entire clearing was scorched, the ground blackened and charred from their intense sessions. Amaya stood at the center, her movements fluid and precise as she trained with a katana. The blade glinted in the sunlight, each swing a testament to her growing skill and determination.



Kurayami Hana stood at the edge of the clearing, observing Amaya’s progress. She noticed Pride’s approach and turned to greet him. “Lord Pride,” she said respectfully, bowing her head.



Pride’s gaze remained fixed on Amaya as he spoke. “Do you think she is ready? It’s almost time.”



Kurayami Hana’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Ready for what, my lord?”



Without looking at her, Pride continued, “I need you to retrieve someone for me from Azumura as quickly as possible. It is someone Amaya is quite familiar with. An opportunity has just presented itself.”



Kurayami Hana’s confusion deepened, but she nodded in understanding. “Of course, my lord. I will leave immediately.”



Pride finally turned to face her, his expression unreadable. “You and Amaya will go together. However, I do not want you to intervene unless absolutely necessary. This mission is to test Amaya’s true potential.”



Kurayami Hana nodded, her expression serious. “Understood, my lord.”



Pride’s attention returned to Amaya. Her movements were a blur of speed and precision, each strike of her katana leaving a trail of sparks in the air.



Amaya paused for a moment, sensing Pride’s gaze. She turned to look at him, her eyes filled with determination. “Is everything alright, Lord Pride?”



Pride nodded slowly. “Yes, Amaya. Everything is proceeding as planned. You and Kurayami Hana will be going on a mission to Azumura. This will be a test of your true potential. Kurayami will accompany you, but she will not intervene unless absolutely necessary.”



Amaya’s grip tightened on the hilt of her katana. “I understand. I won’t let you down.”



Pride watched her for a moment longer before turning and walking away, his mind already focused on the next steps of his plan. The clearing remained silent, the only sound the faint rustle of leaves in the breeze.



Kurayami Hana approached Amaya, her expression calm but serious. “Are you ready for this, Amaya?”



Amaya nodded, her eyes steely with resolve. “Yes. Let’s do this.”



As they prepared to leave, Pride’s voice carried over the clearing one last time. “Remember, the target is someone who has been a thorn in our side for far too long. That pesky Commander must be dealt with. He is the only one I care about being kept alive”



…



As the morning sun rose over Azumura, Confectioner’s Cafe opened its doors, welcoming the early risers with the warm aroma of freshly baked pastries and brewed coffee. The cafe quickly filled with the cheerful chatter of residents and families, their laughter and conversations creating a lively atmosphere.



Commander Korosu sat at a corner table, enjoying a quiet breakfast alongside Guiding Star, Rinaki, Zuku, and Tomio. The table was laden with an assortment of pastries, from flaky croissants to sweet cinnamon rolls, and the comforting scent of the morning meal filled the air.



Korosu took a sip of his coffee, his gaze drifting around the cafe. He silently took note of the happy residents and families enjoying their time together. Children giggled as they shared treats, and friends caught up over steaming cups of tea. The scene was a stark contrast to the tension and danger that often surrounded their lives.



Guiding Star leaned over, her voice soft. “It’s nice to see everyone so happy, isn’t it?”



Korosu nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. “Yes, it is. Moments like these remind us of what we’re fighting for.”



Rinaki, Zuku, and Tomio joined in the conversation, their voices blending with the ambient noise of the cafe. Despite the challenges they faced, there was a sense of camaraderie and hope that permeated the air.



As they enjoyed their breakfast, Korosu couldn’t help but feel a renewed sense of determination. The peaceful scene before him was a reminder of the importance of their mission.

1g1i7h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1g1i7h1/cautionary_tale_iphone_theft_in_london_is_off_the/,Cautionary tale: iPhone theft in London is off the hook!!! (Sympathy welcome.),"The Thursday before leaving for a trip to London I put my 13mini in such a safe place, I could not find it. Anywhere. Nor could the family search team.

The next day, Friday, after a frenzied search, three hours before heading to the airport, I dashed to the Apple store and bought a 15. I also filed an Apple+ insurance claim. (Of course, that replacement phone arrived two days after we'd arrived in London.)

First days of the trip were great, although accompanied by app login issues due to a European eSim phone number. (How to verify when they send codes to the US number? *OY!*)

Then, on Tuesday, I sat at a coffee house counter preparing for a thing I was doing the next day. I was alternating between working on iPad, phone, and notebook. Suddenly, a woman came in and thrust a tattered map in front of my face, jabbering something like *madam please.* No matter which way I turned, she was there, thrusting that map under my nose. I was shouting, ""NO! NO!"" and tried to turn away. She was very strong. She worked her way around me-- toward the side where my phone was, of course-- and then, just as suddenly as she'd appeared, she was gone. 

 I was really rattled. The barista hadn't directly witnessed the event. She said, ""Have you checked that you've got all your things?"" Uhhhh...nope. Thus ensued a feverish-- and fruitless-- period of trying to track her through Find My Phone, all this with an iPad with only wifi. 

I must say, the Londoners I approached for help were absolutely wonderful. They were warm, concerned and generous, giving me wifi access, trying to help charge the iPad, and giving me wonderful advice. The last piece was to seek a police station not far from the theft. Sadly it had closed. But a nearby shop owner and a person making a big delivery to his store stopped everything they were doing to help. 

On their urging, I used one of their phones to call the police emergency line. Ironically, I received a recording asking me to call back in several hours, after the spate of emergencies had died down. I used the iPad to remove everything from my Apple wallet , marked the phone as lost, and later, filed a police report online. Later that evening, I received a notification that the phone had come back on. It showed a specific address. I promptly amended my police report with that information. 

The next day, a police officer called me to discuss the matter. I told him the shop had CCTV. I also said I had no hope of recovering the phone, but suggested I'd feel terrific if they went to the address and harassed them. Although the officer was sympathetic and told me gangs of cell phone thieves are flooding the city, the police tended to not use features like Find My Phone because of issues with accuracy. However, I've since received several emails, saying, hmm, we want to follow up on this. So, who knows. 

Apparently, a cellphone is stolen in London every 6 minutes. There are all kinds of gangs involved. Here's a great article someone sent me after the theft: [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/09/they-rob-you-visibly-with-no-repercussions-the-unstoppable-rise-of-phone-theft](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/09/they-rob-you-visibly-with-no-repercussions-the-unstoppable-rise-of-phone-theft) I noted the police comment that you should call 999 immediately; when I told the officer who called me what happened when I called 999, he laughed and told me a story of an officer whose phone was snatched from his hand as he used it. 

Be careful out there, iPhone family. Evil lurks....

Ignore whether that tastes good or anything, What i'm wondering about is, he typically uses aluminum foil as the lid, and what i wonder is whether that's actually safe? presumably pushing hot acidic liquid through a thin piece of foil means alot of it is gonna leak into the coffee, is that the case and is there any health risk associated?

I work at a museum and we are having a space theme event. My idea was to dehydrate a tomato soup, guests can come up and reconstitute the soup with hot water, and get a feel for what astronaut food is like. However, my biggest challenge is I don't have an electrical outlet close to me, so I will have to use hot water in a kettle/coffee craft. 

After my soup was dehydrated, I blitzed it up and made it into a powder. However, once I added the hot water, it stayed fairly chunky and did not dissolve as well as I would like. I was wondering if anyone would have suggestions on how to help the powder to become more soup(y)? Or if maybe there is another soup to try out that reconstitutes faster than tomato? I think I saw somewhere on the internet that someone had luck with pea soup reconstituting faster. Oooor is there anything I can add or do to the tomato powder to help liquify it faster?

I added my tomato powder back into the dehydrator and I plan to run it again over night. My thought was maybe it will dry out even more and then in the morning I can blend it again and hopefully make the powder even more fine to help dissolve it?

Any suggestions welcome! Thank you

Hi all,
15M, no dating experience.

Since I moved into S3 (June 2023) (year 3 of HS in Scotland), l've sat near and next to this kind, sweet girl in physics and maths. I’ll call her F for now. Since about the start of 2024, we’ve started to have prolonged conversations - mainly about school or traveling as that's what we have in common - and she has seemed genuinely interested 99% of the time. I help her with anything she needs and she helps me with anything I need. 

Just a few thoughts and questions though:
1.    I really like her, and I want to ask her out, but I don't know if there is anything the other way. 

2. How the hell do I ask her out and what do I do to convince her?
My thoughts currently are coffee at Starbucks, I know she loves it. 

If she says yes, probably not the best idea though: Studying together. My school is holding our first set of preliminary exams in late November to Early December and she has asked for help studying for 2 physics unit tests before. (which she has had her highest grades on, probably been a coincidence though). Would it be worthwhile to study as a pair as the relationship is solidifying?

3. I feel if she did say yes, I wouldn't be good enough for her. I don't know why I feel this way, it's just me. Spending a good amount of time together is a slight issue as well - busy till about 7pm Mon-Fri and busy all of Sunday.
I'm a worrier though, and overlook things a lot so this could just be a mental barrier.

4. One of her friends said that we would be great together and suit each other. Is this one of the reasons why I want her now?

My question is, is it better to:
*    Stay as just friends?
*    Shoot my shot?

Will add a bit of backstory into me and her below if anyone wants to know more, not right from the start of S3 though. If not, skip to the tl:dr.

Warning: I can get off topic below.


I had arrived at school early one morning last year. Me and one of her friends - let’s call her S - had to go to physics pretty early to charge some batteries. On the way up a flight of stairs, she says “You know who I think you’d be great with?” 
S takes the piss a lot so I just randomly named someone from our year. S laughs, “No! Honestly, you and F could work really well together. You seem to suit each other and get along well.” I didn’t know her that well then, and at this point I felt very much on the spot. I said “Erm, I’m not sure, I just don’t think I’d be good enough”(maybe this is where that thought originated). She says something like “oh you’ll be fine,” after a bit more conversing, we laugh it off as we approach the classroom.
And that’s about as much as I can remember from that interaction. I think this is where my thoughts towards her could’ve originated.

Maybe a few months later as we are coming up to our Energy & Electricity Assessment in phyiscs, I’m pretty sure I was playing golf with my Dad and his mates, I get a text on Snapchat come through from F asking for help on something from the unit. Potential dividers or something. I get home and I send her photos of my notebook with how to do what she asked. I send her the rest of the notebook as well to help further. She thanks me greatly and when the test rolls around the next day, she comes back with one mark off an A. 69% I think (68.5% rounded up). I’m not taking credit for it but I’d like to think I slightly contributed. 

The week after, I go away to Portugal. And while I’m there, my  mathematics teacher decides to give out homework for Thursday (it’s Wednesday). To add, my maths teacher is a very stereotypical Nigerian man, who emigrated to the uk the year before. At one point earlier in the year, he gave referrals to the headteacher, detentions after school for 3 days, and more to people for not doing or completing his one day notice homework in time. I used to be quite worried about that and when I got the news I wasn’t the happiest. I sort of just accepted that the aforementioned could happen until I get a message from F asking if I had completed it. I said “no, he hasn’t sent it out online yet.” Surprisingly, she sends me the question paper with how to do what we were doing in class that week. And what do you know, about 20 minutes later I had an email to send to him and a few more hours free after school when I get back.

As small as it is, I think us going back and forward helping each other with anything we need (there’s been more than stated above but that’s all I can be bothered writing) has made me feel something between us. Not only that, she’s very kind and pretty. I think she’s the one.

Sorry if all that wasn’t relevant, I apologize for wasting your time.

Now the question. Is it better to just stay as friends or go for it? I’ve thought it for a couple months now. Looked at both sides and I’m still on the fence. What should I do? And if possible, what advice can I get?

Thanks
:)

1g1hs5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1g1hs5g/nutrition_while_on_tirz/,Nutrition while on Tirz,"So, I keep reading posts and comments about being feeling worried that they are hungry. This really concerned me. We NEED to eat. Feeling hungry is normal when it's time to fuel your body, especially if you're active and working out. The whole point of taking this for weightloss is to decrease your appetite or stop from overeating and binging. You need to have regular bowel movements! If you don't, you'll end up with heartburn, nausea, sulphur burps, bubbly/upset tummy etc, HAIRLOSS!!! 
So, a typical day for nutrition these days is:
I wake up and have a fage yogurt. I typically don't have much of an appetite early, but I make sure to get in at least this. About an hour or so later, I'll make a protein shake w almond milk and 2 scoops of whey protein (30 grams protein) For lunch, I've been eating 1 small grilled chicken breast with sliced cucumbers and snow peas and hummus. I drink a lot of water in between! Then, for dinner I will eat grilled salmon sometimes with yam or peas. And sometimes for my snack, I will eat an apple, sometimes I'll have a chobani flip cup yogurt ( if I've not had sugar at all that day) 
If I go to the movies or an event where people are eating junk, I bring candies under 3 grams of sugar. Some have 27 grams of fiber, as they are vegetable based. I cut out all bad carbs, and all drinks aside from water and coffee. ( watch what you put in your coffee! It adds up quickly!) Next week I'll switch things up to chicken pho and a big green salad. Occasionally, I'll eat eggs, but they sometimes give me heartburn. ",3,1728674429.0,tirzepatidecompound,4,1.0,False

Since then, she hasn’t been talking to me on FaceTime and has been responding very dryly to my texts. She keeps saying she’s really busy with school (I work 10-12 hours a day, sometimes even on weekends, and I still manage to make time for her, but okay 🤷🏻‍♂️)

I finally found something that helped me to stop - I put Botox in my jaw against bruxism (I clench my teeth at night, too). I thought, who knows, maybe that's the solution, I was so desperate, I would try anyhing. And I didn't bite my cheecks since freaking 3 1/2 months now!   
The first treatment (30 units botox) didn't change a thing, but 2 weeks later, they injected 14 units more and that helped! I feel like I am not even able to bite my cheeks like I used to! The botox kind of ""paralyzes"" the masseter muscle in the jaw.  
I still can't believe that worked. I tried soooo many things, since I have been cheek biting since I was about 17, now I am 35. I have been to three different medical hypnosis therapists, I tried taking antidepressants, 'cause my neurologist suggested it, I did therapy, I've seen an oral and maxillofacial surgery specialist, who made a prototype jaw splint for me, I've been to a self-help group, I tried meditation, mindfulness exercises and more. NOTHING HELPED! Until this!   
I am not sure how long it will last, but my hope is that my body and mind will unlearn the habit over time. And if not, I guess I have to find some way to get my health insurance to pay for the costs. It wasn't cheap: 360 €. I can't afford that if I might have to do it twice or more per year.   
I hope this will help other people, too and that's it's not only me. I feel so free since I stopped biting, it's life changing...   
Perhaps another thing also played a tiny role, as I stopped drinking coffee for two months about the same time that I had the Botox injections. But I am back on coffee (not as much as I used to) and it didn't come back.   
All the best,

We met in university and have been best buds for almost three years now and never had any troublesome times during our friendship before. When this semester started in uni three weeks ago, I didnt spend time with her during the breaks between lectures or after lectures to go get coffee, not because i dont enjoy her company but because my long distance boyfriend (M, 20) also attends that university and the only time i can see him is while we're attending lectures and during breaks since i do not live in the city where the university is at so i commute. I hadnt seen him all summer for almost four months because i have strict parents and i cannot go see him and he cannot come see me and i missed him very much. So all these three weeks ive been trying to spend all the timei can with him before uni gets real serious. Since were all classmates and we have a group of 4 that we already hang out with i was thinking that as soon as i get enough alone time with my boyfriend we were gonna get back into hanging out collectively like we used to. 
Yesterday that friend texted me in a fit of rage and dissapointment on how she felt so hurt that i hadnt stayed with her this whole time. Which i kind of understand because were suplosed to be besties and i feel like if i had told her before hand that ""hey forgive me but im gonna leave u alone for a while to see my boyfriend who i havent seen for so long and please be patient because things are gonna get back to normal as soon as i hang out with him enough"" things wouldnt have to come to this. I admit it is my fault and i could have managed the situation and been more aware of her feelings way more, but the things she was spewing out felt outlandish to me. 
She was talking ablut how she feels that she is not my top priority, that i do not appreciate our friendship as much as she does, and to boil it down she told me to choose between me and my boyfriend and with who to stay more during uni days????????
I truly feel bad that i left her alone the past weeks and i didnt like it either, but i was not gonna keep going with it. I asked her to calm down and told her that everything would go back to normal, but idk making me choose between her and my very serious relationship really doesnt sit right with me.

A bit of background I'm f24 and he's m40. He works whilst I am a home maker. We have no kids, 4 fur babys and he's doesn't lift a finger when home (he doesn't even have to make his own coffees as I do it). I have no family or friends. We have his family and 1 other couple we both are friends with and no leaving is not a option.

Basically our problem is in the bedroom. I draw the line at things near my bum basically. I cannot stand anything anally and have told him all this. He has in the past ignored it and just done what he wants, than apologised, made promises, cried and threatening to end himself in the past. But he still just won't stop. No he hasn't actaully ""gone up"" there in a long time but he's constantly trying to push it near/up/around there and it genuinely knocks me sick. He knows it does and is a instant complete mood killer for me but he just won't stop. Even normal sex now turns my stomach or doesn't interest me because he will be on my ear telling me he's going to and to ""let it happen"". I've tried to compromise and let him touch himself whilst near there but he just every single time pushes it and if I pull back/push him away he just starts going mad. This is what happened tonight. He wanted to but I didn't and after 5 minutes of him moaning I agreed to the compromise. He was there for 20 minutes just pushing it and trying to and I felt uncomfortable and kept pushing him away and moving. In the end he got up, dressed amd stormed out like usual. Muttering under his breath ""it's a fucking joke, I'm sick of this, u never let me"".... but unlike usual I'm not sat crying wondering how I'm going to apologise or getting upset and teary eyed knowing he's going to be in a mood with me when he gets home.

 I've been reading alot of other reddits of people who have had similar interactions with there partners to try and help me, but I keep seeing there not the problem, it's not them, or there partners understand there boundaries and now im just pissed. I'm angry that he won't fucking stop and leave that area/subject alone. I'm angry hearing that it's always fucking my fault that I no longer enjoy sex. I'm angry that it's always me who he classes as in the wrong for not agreeing. I'm just so fucking angry and want to scream into the boud that this is my life/situation. I just wanna know if I am in the wrong for not just agreeing or if in right to be angry as he's making me feel like I'm the crazy one but I feel he's the one in the wrong???? Do I have the right to be angry? Am I the crazy 1?",1,1728673601.0,u_fuzzysockedpug,0,0.99,False
1g1hh3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1g1hh3x/maximize_money_at_mcdonalds/,Maximize money at McDonald's ,"This may be kind of silly because a lot of frugal people might not get fast food anyway so this may not be relevant to everyone. It could be useful to someone needing a meal and trying to stretch their money though.

I used to work at McDonald's and I couldn't believe the amount of people getting individual meals for every member of the family. The most cost effective items on the menu that I have found as a worker and consumer are the triple cheeseburgers and the baskets of fries. 

The triple is very filling and, to me, isn't excessive because of how thin the patties are. It honestly makes it similar to the thickness of a burger at home. 

The basket of fries is equal to two medium fries and is only a 40 cents more than one medium. Most of the time I've ordered it it's even more than   that. 

Also, just to throw in at the end a couple things I learned there that save money but aren't as big of a deal or might be a little more niche. If you are going to get a fountain drink, anything but a large is a bad deal. Last, and most specific, for a good iced coffee the ""Vanilla Iced Coffee"" and ""Vanilla Iced Latte"" are identical. The iced coffee is cheaper, and the sizes give you more, like a latte large and an iced coffee large are different. 

I really enjoy tips like this so hopefully you guys do too. ",29,1728673589.0,Frugal,44,0.8,False

Chapter 1  
  
Beneath the surface is only the unknown.  
  
You don't know what or who lies there, and whatever dwells there don't know about you either.  
  
If you for a moment let yourself, you can almost see it. Something with a mind, just like yours.  
  
However, you are still worlds apart.  
  
Forever separated. Forever alone.  
  
""Ashley, it time to go"" my uncle shouts from downstairs,  
  
I wake from my daydreaming and realize it's time for our weekly fishing hour.  
  
""im ready"" I responded, while putting on my fishing gear.  
  
The sun is shining through the Window in my room, illuminating the bookshelves and medical equipment. My room is on the 2nd floor of the cabin, so the view over the ocean is quite pleasant.  
  
We go outside and head to the quay where Uncle's fishing boat is.  
  
The Wind is blowing, but the ocean is rather still.  
  
On our way to the boat we hear the seagulls above and greet the fishermen in the area.  
  
I ask my uncle where he thinks we should go. ""I think the place near the cave is good this time of year"" he says.  
  
I'm visiting him in his place at the sea-side town for the summer, and despite seeing fishing as a boys-thing he lets me go with him when he's fishing. My dad said it was fine, as long as we don't go too far out shore. As much as i like the city, i quite like the seaside town, as it helps me relax and i feel at peace very much. Plus I love doing my morning jogs on the beach.  
  
After going to the place that we decided we take out our fishing rods and settle down.  
  
A few minutes we just sit there, looking out, thinking about anything our minds wander to.  
  
Suddenly I felt a strong pull on my rod. It is stronger than any fish I have caught before, almost as there was a human on the other end. ""This must be a big one"" i think to myself as i continue to struggle""  
  
I try to reel it in, but it is too strong and I have to let it go. Uncle says it's no problem, and we decide to go back to land. ""We can try again some time,"" i think to myself.  
  
As we are leaving I see something move under the surface. I assume it's just a large fish, but something about it looks?odd. It almost looks like?a human.  
  
Before i can make out what it is, its gone, having vanishes into the depth.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
We get home and uncle decided to make some tea for us.  
  
I decided to change clothes due to them getting soaked. As i do i recall what i saw and wonder what I could have been.  
  
""Hey uncle"" I say in a quiet voice, ""are there any legends of sea creatures around this area?""  
  
""huh?you mean like giant squids or sharks or whatever"" my uncle responds.  
  
""I dunno..the thing i caught today seemed rather large and heavy"" i say.  
  
I think about the human like shape i saw swimming away and wonder..what could it have been, and is it still out there.  
  
""Well..there have happened a few times before, fishermens and sailors spotting strange beings under the surface..and sometimes feeling strong struggles in their nets and hooks', this area has larger fishes then most but I'm not sure what else it could be"".  
  
I take in what he said. ""Maybe that was it??oh well"".  
  
""I think i'm going to bed now"" i say, wanting time to think for myself.  
  
""Sounds good..good night Ashley"" uncle says in a calm and understanding tone.  
  
Even though he can be hard headed sometimes I do really like my uncle, he's the one part of my family i feel truly comfortable with talking to about anything.  
  
I enter my room and start putting on my night dress. I spot blood on it and immediately rush to the bathroom.  
  
A few minutes later I am in bed and am trying to fall asleep.  
  
Despite not doing a lot today, I feel exhausted and tired and it doesn't take a long time before I feel my eyelids feeling heavy.  
  
""It was probably nothing under the surface"" I think and wonder what I will do tomorrow.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
In my dreams I am on the beach,looking out over the horizon.  
  
It appears to be night time, and the moon is in full view.  
  
I dip my feet in the water, it is cold but pleasant.  
  
The air is still and not a sound can be heard.  
  
Not a person in Sight.  
  
When I look down, I see a string of red seeping through the water.  
  
I then hear a scream coming from the water.  
  
I look out and see someone drowning.  
  
I start swimming towards them, but no matter how much i swim i can't get near them  
  
When I finally get there the person has lost consciousness and I have to grab their hand to stop them from being submerged in water.  
  
I look up to the sky, only to see a full moon staring down at me  
  
""You aren't meant to be""  
  
I hear these in my mind, but I can't tell who said it.  
  
Everything goes dark, and I feel cold.  
  
I awake in a cold sweat, and spend the rest of the night sleepless.  
  
""What was that dream about"".  
  
Chapter 4  
  
I go down to the kitchen to make myself some morning coffee.  
  
While I prefer tea, coffee is easily the best way for me to have a good start.  
  
I brush my teeth, water the plants, and write in my dairy of what happened yesterday as I forgot about that.  
  
I compliment going on a walk to shake off what has happened the last few days.  
  
I put on my shoes and my uncle's jacket and baseball cap with fishermen tags on it, as my own is in the dryer, and head out for the morning walk along the beachside, which is my favorite thing to do here. The calmness and silence of the sea is a great change of pace from the noise of everyday life. I especially enjoy having the wind tug at my long, hazelnut brown hair.  
  
I look out over the sea and think about the dream I had last night.  
  
""I wonder what that was about,"" I thought to myself, as I often believe dreams have some sort of meaning.  
  
Many times i've dreamed of something that has happened in real life, so this might be the same.  
  
But maybe it was just about what I saw while fishing.  
  
When I'm lost in thought I hear something.  
  
A small, barely audible panting noise, like that of a wounded animal, and on occasion a small whimper of pain.  
  
Strangely enough, while people usually don't go to this part of the beach, outside from myself, the noises sound oddly human.  
  
""It may be someone who was hurt swimming on one of those sea urchins"" I think, and rushed over trying to find them.  
  
I track down where the noise comes from and it leads me to a small cave opening.  
  
I've seen this cave a few times before, but never ventured into it.  
  
Outside I spot a few red spots in the sand, and realize this person must be hurt.  
  
""Hello, is anyone there?"" I shouted into the cave.  
  
No response.  
  
It's cold and dark, so I take out a small flashlight in my pocket,and Shine a light in front of me to see where I'm going.  
  
""I'm coming in there now, ok?"" shout and start walking into the darkness.  
  
As the darkness grows stronger, my light starts to fade but I can still see but only barely.  
  
I'm starting to want to go back and get someone else to help, but I decided to atleast check on the person who's injured.  
  
I hear the noises even louder now and go around a large rock to finally see its source  
  
What I see is going to change my life forever.  
  
  
  
Chapter 5  
  
It is a girl. A relatively normal looking girl.  
  
She has medium length dirty-blonde hair, dark green eyes, and is wearing a T-shirt with red and white rose petals on them. She is quite skinny, especially compared to my more well-toned build, and her skin is pale , but with an odd hint of gray.  
  
If you saw her while out on town, you wouldn't think much of her.  
  
She really appears as just a normal girl, around my age i would even say.  
  
What is not normal however, is what is below her waist. Instead of having legs and feet, she has a long, blue colored fishtail with a fin in the shape of a heart.  
  
I recognize what she is almost immediately, a creature I have heard several stories of as a young girl.  
  
She is a mermaid.  
  
I kneel down and try to reach out to her to touch her cheek. She draws back, whimpering in fear and pain. I look at her tail and see she is injured and one of her scales is missing, seemingly from a hook of some kind.  
  
I think back on what happened yesterday with the fishing. ""oh god..did i do that..no it seems more recent"", i think to myself.  
  
""Doesn't matter right now anyways""  
  
The mermaid strat quivering even more  
  
""Hey,hey,it's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you"" I whisper. It looks like she understands me and stops shaking.  
  
I rip off a part of my shirt and use it to cover her wound.  
  
""There, that should do it for now, i,ll be back later with some food okay"" a say to her  
  
She nods as I exit the cave.  
  
Chapter 6  
  
On my way home, I go to the grocery store to pick some food.  
  
I decided to go with rice balls ,pears, and ice tea.  
  
I consider sushi, but realize it may be weird for a mermaid to eat.  
  
When I get home I pack it in a backpack which I hide in my room and take out my jacket from the dryer.  
  
""what happened to your shirt?"" Uncle asks when he sees my ripped-off sleeve.  
  
""Oh no ... .forgot about that"" i think to myself.  
  
""Oh, I just..stumbled into a bush and branches tore them off"" I lied to avoid suspicion.  
  
""Umm ... .alright then, be careful next time, alright"" he responds.  
  
I figure it's best to keep my new friends a secret for now, just in case.  
  
Who knows how he will react, even though I do trust him.  
  
I remember what he told me about fishermans seeing unusual shapes and thinking it might have been her.  
  
""I just look out for her until she's ready to be on her Own again"".  
  
The next day I head back to the cave, now with food and a live.aid kit to patch up her wound better. And sure enough she is still there, wanting for me.  
  
Chapter 7  
  
""My name is Jessica by the way, thanks for saving me before"" says the mermaid while we share the food I brought.  
  
She has a very gentle voice, and it's quite pleasant to listen to.  
  
""Sure, no problem,"" I responded.  
  
I'm not very good at conversation with people I don't know, but she strikes me as the quiet type, so I don't feel pressured to speak.  
  
We sit in the cave for several hours and look out over the sea. I learned that despite being a mermaid, she actually is not very different from me in terms of lifestyle. She likes clothing brands,going to stores, and reading. Mermaids seem to have a society of their own, in some way.  
  
She is really nice to be around and I enjoy every second. This is the first time in a while i've just hung out with another girl my age, and it's quite fun.  
  
But there is a question I have to ask her. Something that has been bugging me since i found her yesterday and want to get off my chest.  
  
""Do you like?don't like humans?hate them even?"" Even though I hesitated at first.  
  
""What do you mean?"" She asks, her eyes showing a bit of concern.  
  
""When i found you you seemed to be scared of me, as if you thought i would hurt you in some way"" i say. ""Though that might have been just a instinctual reaction""  
  
She looks away for a second, with a glimt of sadness in her eyes and a serious expression before saying in a solemn tone.  
  
""Well, you see, us mermaids dont have the best history with humans, and i have been thought to be very careful around them""  
  
When she sees my worried expression she quickly apologizes  
  
""I don't hold it against you of course, you saved my life after all, and i can tell you are a good person""  
  
""I think i should go home now, i'll check up from time to time from now on, okay?"" i say, noticing it's getting late, and feeling I need time alone to think.  
  
""Sure, sounds good"" she says.  
  
When i get home im worried about what she said.  
  
Can we truly be friends after all, or are we destined to forever be apart.  
  
If mermaids and humans are enemies then are our individual feelings important, or not.  
  
Nevertheless I need to take care of her until she is ready to be on her own again.  
  
After that she can make the decision.  
  
  
  
Chapter 8  
  
The weeks pass by and I continue checking up on Jessica every few days.  
  
It has almost become a routine of Mine.  
  
I bring her food, patch her up, talk with her for a bit, and repeat.  
  
I'm still worried about what she said about humans but I try not to think about it.  
  
It's not important, and I just need to care for her until she has healed up.  
  
My uncle has yet to suspect anything..or at least he hasn't said anything about it to me.  
  
Things are going well, and I feel it's going to work out.  
  
One day, when I came into the cave she seemed paler than usual.  
  
I quickly run over to hold her as she can barely sit up on her own.  
  
When I ask her about it, she said she was sorry.  
  
""It seemed as though,despite your efforts,I might not make it"" she says between her coughs.  
  
""What?why?what have i done wrong i,..i don't"" i stutterd, being confused, worried and upset at the same time.  
  
""shhhhh.you havent done anything wrong Ashley..but i think i lost to much blood, once a mermaid loses one of it scales you see, the blood the lose, even if not much, can be lethal, the only thing that could save me was blood from another, but i can't ask that much of yo..where did she go""  
  
Im already running along the shore, wiping tears from my eyes  
  
She can't be dying..she just can't.  
  
I was supposed to look after her until she could contione on her own, and i Will do what I must to save her.  
  
I simply just have to.  
  
I remember a blood transfusion device uncle had in his medical care room.  
  
He has a history of working as the towns doctor, and have even though me a few things about it.  
  
I will take it in order to save her. Give her as much blood as she has to have, even if I myself die.  
  
A human and a mermaid may not be able to be friends, but two teenage girls who happen to like each-other can.  
  
Chapter 9  
  
I sneak into the room, and pick up the pole the transfer is attached to.  
  
Uncle is currently asleep, and probably won't notice anything.  
  
""I'm sorry uncle, I have to borrow this, promise I will return it"". I think to myself.  
  
I don't like having to take something belonging to him without permission, but this situation is desperate, and i Will return it afterwards.  
  
I pray this Will go well, or else I don't know what to do.  
  
I go into the cave and Jessica is there waiting for me, looking like she did before.  
  
I tell her in detail what I'm about to do.  
  
""Are you sure?"" she says several times, ""you have done enough as it is..and besides..we aren't supposed to even be friends"".  
  
""I don't care,"" I say.  
  
""You are my friend and i will save you"", ""because you are one of the few people ive met that i genuinely like being around.  
  
I pierce my arm with the needle. The pain is bad but I push through it.  
  
Jessica is at first hesitant but does the same with the other needle, whimpering in pain.  
  
We both lay down in order for the operation to work.  
  
Soon enough the blood starts to transfer and I see how she slowly starts to look healthier.  
  
When we are done, she starts to move towards the ocean.  
  
""Thanks for everything Ash, if you ever need me just go here and call out my name""  
  
""Do you still want to be my friend, despite??.everything?"" I asked, visibly worried.  
  
She looks at me before Smiling gently and simply answering  
  
""Of Course i do""  
  
""but before i leave..how about one final talk""  
  
Chapter 10  
  
And so we lay there, on the shore, under the moon.  
  
Ashley and Jessica  
  
mermaid and human.  
  
Focused on nothing but each other and our mutual feelings.  
  
We talk and banter.  
  
About the things we both love.  
  
Simply because we love being in each other's company.  
  
beneath the surface lies things you can't understand.  
  
but if you reach out you can just about touch and form a unique connection  
  
Together forever.

1g1hd71,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g1hd71/no_longer_friendssomething_else/,No Longer Friends/Something Else,"Hi,

Me: 28M

Her: 24F

2-months

 

I (28m) just started a graduate program in another state. I don’t have any friends or family in the area, and it has been difficult. I met another student (24f) in my program back in August, and we seemed to really click. However, midway in September, she got weird. She hurt my feelings a few times, but I can’t tell if I may be overly sensitive or if maybe I’m the reason why it happened.

 

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder last year from a psychologist and two separate psychiatrists. It’s been a lifelong struggle of mine since at least 10 years old when I began having recurring suicidal thoughts that I’ve dealt with my entire life, but I think even earlier than that based on my parents’ observations of me. The anxiety and depression made it extremely difficult for me to fit into social situations, and my parents eventually took me out of traditional school and placed me in a distance learning program, so I had even less social interactions with other people after that. I think I may have PTSD as well, but I am not sure. My biggest comfort was binge eating, so I became morbidly obese, and I’ve had extremely low self-esteem for my entire life because of my appearance; I lost weight after figuring out a low-glycemic diet that worked for me, but I am still not happy with how I look. I am 6’3” 220, but I seem to still have a very high body-fat percentage, and I also suffer from gynecomastia, which has made me hate my body since I was about 6 and people made fun of me at swimming pools. I also have many stretch marks.

 

I didn’t spend time around people until I started my undergraduate, but I found that being around people in college was too difficult and stressful. I couldn’t form social relationships with other people because of my anxious thinking; my previous psychologist said that I was hyperaware from having untreated anxiety for such a long time in my life. She told me that it was my attempt to protect myself, but every social interaction that I’ve ever had followed a similar pattern: I would meet someone, try really hard to get them to like me, eventually see signs that were not overtly positive that made me think that they disliked me, and then I would pull back so that I wouldn’t annoy them. Then they would never try to follow up with me and the connection would die out. This happened continuously, both in undergraduate, when I studied abroad, when I worked, and when I went into the Peace Corps.

 

I’ve had some friendships and people I’ve connected with, but eventually I always end up feeling like I’m a burden and that they’d be happier without me in their lives. The longest friendship I had was for about 5-years with a guy I met in my last year of college. The difference seemed to be that he was really good about continuously reaching out to me and following up, so that I didn’t need to feel like I was pestering him. Eventually, though, I got into a really bad depressive episode and ended up blocking him because I was embarrassed about my life and didn’t want him to know that I had lost my job. I wanted to disconnect so that I didn’t feel so vulnerable.

 

I’ve been really scared about taking medicine, but a few months ago, I started Lexapro under a psychiatrist’s care. I found that it helped an extreme amount with my depression and anxious thinking. I’ve never in my life not had at least a day out of my week where I felt extremely depressed and had at least a general thought of ‘why am I alive? I should kill myself.’ After starting the medication, I started feeling incredibly better, and so many things seemed easier. I started the medication because after a year of CBT, I still wasn’t feeling great and I was going to start this graduate program, so I wanted to try something more to get me over the hump.

 

When I moved in August for my graduate program, I attended an orientation event with a group of students in my program. Whereas before everything was a focus on ‘what do I say now? Did I say the right thing? Did they think it was funny? What else should I be doing? What do I do now? Where do I sit? Should I say I had a great time or just leave? Do they think I’m weird? Did I do the right thing? Did I say too much?’ the anxious thoughts weren’t at the forefront of my mind and I was able to just be. I thought that I was a completely changed person and it seemed incredibly different than what I was used to experiencing. I hung out with most of the people at least once or twice after that, attended a party, and also did a few other things, but I also really connected with this girl that I met in the orientation event too.

 

My previous psychologist told me not to connect overly much with anyone in my graduate program because it is a professional program and those individuals may one day be your coworkers or bosses, so treat them like colleagues and not friends. I’m a first-generation college graduate, so I have no experience with anything in academia, but I tried to follow this advice. However, the girl was insistent and kept trying to talk to me, and then she mentioned she was a huge fan of this guitarist that I liked too. We started talking and we started sharing music with each other, and it turned out that she had a lot of similar music tastes as me. Over the next few weeks in August, we texted almost every single day for hours at a time, she had a similar sense of humor as me and we shared a bunch of jokes, and I formed a crush on her. I felt that a lot of times that we were flirting with the way that she would look at me and the general demeanor of the jokes as being something that felt more than just friendly but more intimate and playful. It’s hard to say, though, because I don’t have a lot of experience, but it really did feel like more than just friendly. I also took her out for coffee to celebrate her getting a promotion at work.

 

Eventually we went out a couple of times together, we never called each other friend or anything like that or had a definitive term for each other, but I found myself really enjoying being around her. Then our program started and the first day I saw her and waved and said ‘hello’ and she ignored me. Then a few days later I saw her again, waved at her and said hi when she was right next to me, and she didn’t acknowledge me at all. I also didn’t hear from her at all during those first week days.

 

It really threw me off and deeply hurt my feelings because some of the other people I had met did that too. It was like everyone flipped a switch from before school started where everyone was open and friendly and then when it started everyone became really closed off, cliquey and rude. I felt really whiplashed, but especially from her reaction.

 

Then that Saturday she sent me about twelve texts talking about wanting to do all of these things together with me and I got confused. I told her that she had hurt my feelings, and she apologized and said she didn’t mean to do that, but that she still wanted to spend time with me. We ended up hanging out the next weekend because she had to cancel for those Sunday plans we had. She said she got an ear infection because she was a college swimmer, so I got her some swimmer ear plugs to protect her ears in the future. She met me at a café for coffee on Sunday, and we went to a record store where I purchased her a handful of records since she had lost most of hers in her move. It wasn’t much money, but I thought it would be nice; I also got her this goofy Sesame Street album as a joke too.

 

She took me back to her apartment where we ended up sitting listening to records together for a few hours. The first one we played was the Sesame Street album and it apparently wasn’t lined up correctly or something and let out this horrible shriek. I thought it was hilarious and we joked about it; I told her she had to keep the cursed album now and that she was going to become haunted from it. She also told me about this guy she was kind of seeing from before but that she had fallen out of contact with, and then she told me ‘I want to know you’ and she wanted to hear about me and what was going on with me. She also kept talking about how guys were constantly trying to date her and stuff like that too and how these European guys at the local bar kept hitting on her and all of these guys she met internationally kept saying it was impossible not to fall in love with her. Eventually she ended up cooking me dinner, which I helped to make, and then we watched some television and part of a movie together before she had to do these swim tryouts. I went with her so that she had someone there to root for her, and afterwards she said she wanted to take me out for icecream. We spent the entire day together and it felt completely easy and fun; there was no awkwardness or hangups, and she told me again that she wanted to do a bunch of things together with me, including taking dancing classes together. I walked her home and then told her bye, and she asked if I wanted my albums I bought, and I told her I got them for her. She seemed to get a tiny bit weird, but I just told her I wanted her to have them.

 

That night I sent her some texts that may have been a bit odd talking about how it was weird that I had basically made her make me dinner and that I was sorry about that, and that I shouldn’t have made her take the albums because I got weird in my head after I left and I was thinking about her reaction. I thought maybe I had overstepped and didn’t know what to do, so I sent her those texts, which I think may have been off-putting or weird. The next day, though, she seemed to change, and her texts seemed to be less open and easy. She also said that she wouldn’t do the dance class and that ‘she had to turn down a lot of people for things to keep her schedule’ and the like. It was really weird and I wasn’t sure what had happened or what was up, but I didn’t press the issue. I eventually asked her if she wanted to see this new movie she mentioned together, and she agreed to go together that next Sunday.

 

During that week, though, she seemed different and less interested in texting me. I may have easily been over reading things because I also noticed I started to feel extremely anxious and depressed again after this, so I’m not sure I can trust how I saw everything. But it felt weird – there were delays in responses whereas before she would text almost immediately back and we would have text conversations, and it just seemed a lot colder. I didn’t really understand why. Then Sunday came and I felt really odd, and when I picked her up she seemed super stiff. Again, it could have just been me, but it felt really uncomfortable and odd, like I shouldn’t speak. I read a short story before that said an interaction was ‘like glass between cotton balls,’ and that’s what it felt like – really precarious for some reason. She also seemed to really pointedly call me her ‘friend’ too, which she never really did. The weirdest part, though, was that we got seats together for the movie, and then she purposefully moved down one so she wasn’t sitting directly next to me. It just seemed kind of odd and extremely deliberate, and I didn’t know why she did that. It just made the awkwardness even more awkward for me, like she didn’t want to be there or be around me.

 

She had had an interview earlier before the movie that same day and I had bought her favorite drink that we had been joking about together, and she said thank you and hugged me when I gave it to her when I dropped her off. That was the only point when she seemed to become warm and open again and felt like before. I felt extremely upset, however, and super confused as to what happened. I ended up texting her later asking if anything was up, and she said she thought there was something going on with me. I felt weird and I had been dealing with stress from how she had been acting the week prior, but I just told her that I really appreciated her because I hadn’t connected with anyone like her and that I was really struggling socially to find anyone I liked. She said she really appreciated having our friendship again and that ‘we were friends’ and stuff like that. It seemed like she kept pointedly mentioning that.

 

Eventually she invited me out to this concert that Thursday, but I didn’t see the invitation until it was about to begin. I went there to meet her and texted her, and then she told me she had also invited this other guy. Initially she said she was going to the concert directly after class, but she got there late and when she got there, she was wearing high heels, a low cut dress, and perfume and makeup on, and all of this other stuff. I had gotten us seats at the front, and she came to sit with me. When the other person arrived, though, she immediately told me that ‘he wanted to sit in the back so she was going to move.’ She didn’t invite me to go with her or anything, and I didn’t know what to do, so I followed her. The guy didn’t introduce himself to me, and when we were going to sit down, she deliberately moved to sit directly next to him and left a gap between myself and her again. It really threw me off because I didn’t know why she would have invited me to this if she was on a date or didn’t want me there. She also mentioned that her and this guy had been doing a lot of stuff together and while I was sitting there, they were making plans together in front of me without inviting me to them.

 

Her and the guy spent the entire time talking to each other and no one said a word to me for the rest of the concert. After it ended, we left and it seemed pretty clear that she and him were going to continue hanging out. I left and sent her a text saying sorry and that I didn’t realize, but not anything about her ‘being on a date.’ The concert ended at 8pm and at about 11pm she texted me saying some stuff but most importantly ‘there’s nothing there!!!’ like that, and it seemed extremely defensive or embarrassed to me, like she had been caught or something weird. It just really completely hurt my feelings to have someone I thought that I had gotten close with to suddenly switch like that and treat me like she did – I’d never treat anyone like that unless they had done something really horrible to me. I became completely depressed and suicidal despite my Lexapro. She had also suggested getting together on Sunday before the concert, but after the concert, I texted her that I had to cancel.

 

The next week I ended up texting her after thinking maybe I was too sensitive and she never responded. I then texted her two days in a row and she still never responded until two days after on Friday. She just sent a generic text saying she had been busy, but I had asked her a bunch of questions on how she was and what she was doing like before with some jokes, and she didn’t respond at all to any of that. I just told her to enjoy her weekend.

 

A week later she randomly texted me saying that ‘she knew I had been going through some things but that she was there if I wanted to talk,’ and it just really made me angry. It was like she didn’t care at all about what she did at the concert or that she hadn’t been communicating or responding to me, and then she just sent me this random text about being busy and everything but how she’s ‘there for me’ and stuff, and it just really upset me. It felt like I was an obligation and she had to say that so she wasn’t the bad guy. I told her not to worry about me and that she didn’t need to feel like she had to keep in touch with me.

 

It’s been over a week and I haven’t heard from her at all. I accidentally saw her a couple of times and she was with all of these people laughing and seeming incredibly happy. It just really, really, really hurts because I haven’t really met people that I’ve connected to, especially a girl. I’m a virgin because of my non-existent self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and deep seated self-loathing. It’s like my brain is in two-halves and one side realizes that it wasn’t really anything, but then the other part has this hugely deep hole of grief. I keep getting waves of feeling overwhelmed and then I sob uncontrollably. I became attached too hard or read too deeply into things because of my mental disorders, but I really thought that she seemed to like me romantically. It just seemed like suddenly there was a switch and I don’t know why; I’m not sure if I was the one who was wrong.

 

I just feel suicidally depressed because I really was hoping my life was going to be different this time, especially with the Lexapro and CBT I had been doing. I just got in to see a new psychologist because my old one was out of state, but I just feel horrid, like I have this deep, deep grief even though objectively it doesn’t seem like this deserves it. I think it may be partly PTSD because of the number of similar situations that have happened in the past, so I think maybe those similar feelings that I never adequately dealt with are coming up with this one too.

 

It just feels like no one ever notices my absence, or that they prefer it. I keep seeing all of these people with all of their friends, and I just don’t know why that is never me. I thought I was going to be able to be different this time because of the help I had gotten for my anxiety and depression, but it’s all the same and now I’m back to being alone again in my room with no one to talk to or spend time with. I just don’t get why she treated me like that, and then I blame myself and then I wonder if maybe I’m being too sensitive and that she didn’t actually do anything wrong and that I was the weird one? I don’t really know because of my disorders making it feel hard to trust myself, but my psychologist told me that my feelings aren’t wrong and I can trust myself to understand social situations. It’s just confusing because I don’t know why all of this happened, and since it always seems to happen, I wonder if it’s my fault, or if maybe she was the one who knew what she was doing and that she really didn’t want me to be around?

 

The only thing I can think of is that she felt desperate, connected with me early on before the program started and she was still alone, and then when classes started she began hanging out with more people, and then she found people, like this guy, that she preferred, and then suddenly I wasn’t worth the time or effort anymore because she ‘traded up’ to someone better. I had similar things happen in the past, and it seems to make the most sense to me, but I’m not sure if that sounds crazy or not. It seems like her suddenly calling me friend, deliberate efforts to do things like sit apart from me and keep me physically distant, the longer and longer times between texts, and stuff like that means she wasn’t interested in me and wanted to disconnect.

Just after that Sunday ‘date’ we had, she seemed to change and got distant. Texts were longer and longer to receive, my jokes no longer seemed to make her amused, she seemed less interested in expending effort towards me, then the concert thing was really hurtful and completely rude in my opinion. Am I the one in the wrong here? Am I crazy? Or was she just a shallow person that I shouldn’t have gotten this wrapped up in? I guess I wish I could have that relationship from before back, but I think that was never real and just a front for her to feel connected. I don’t know why she would do that to me.

 

It feels horrible. Is it my fault?

TL;DR I have mental disorders. I met a girl that I thought was romantically interested in me. We seemed to connect in a really deep way. I thought we had a couple of dates together. Then she got distant and I didn't understand why. A really embarrassing experience happened when she invited me to a concert and it was clear she was on a date with another guy who came later. I ended up telling her she didn't need to feel obligated to stay in contact with me. She never texted me and she seemed to be really happy with friends when I see her. I'm all alone again and I'm depressed.",1,1728673300.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Long story short - I still love my ex from 8 years ago...Any advice?,"Hey! It’s my first post here and I’m probably gonna be eaten alive in the comments for telling this but still I wanna get it out here cause idk where to go rn.

When I was 15 I met my first love. It was the first person ever that I loved, adored. She was my everything. Sam goes for her (so I think after the things she told me) We were togheter for 4 years and then college came. We got seperated not seeing each other much and one thing led to another she met someone else and let me go. I was never really angry at here or anything and we ended things on good terms. Even got togheter for a coffee a couple of times later. And the this just stopped. The covid hit and that was kinda it. When we’ve broken up we told to each that if anything happens and we need support we can call each other.

So here it gets complicated…After we stopped getting in touch I met a girl which I really liked she was everything I ever wanted and she kinda helped me got through my first love. After two years togheter I was 23, she couple of months older we got a baby. We both wanted to have kids very young and I don’t regret anything that I did. So the months/years went by she became different. There was no affection if I wasn’t the one who initiated it (like kisses, touching etc.) conversations became arguments and so on.

I’m doing everything I can and do stuff for her, seek for some attention bring her flowers, do house chores, take care of a kid that I love indefinitely. I would literally do anything but I don’t get anything from her. She also like gets angry or annoyed quickly. But still I care for her. And because of that I wanted to have another kid and he is not half way through the second pregnancy….

Half a year ago i saw some old pics of me and my first love in my gallery (they were from our prom) and I couldn't help myself and started to cry like I never did before. I still have her number and I know she didn’t change it and I wanna call her so badly just like to ask for some advice and ask how she’s been but I’m so scared. What if she has a boyfriend and I ruin anything. I’ve been wanting to call her for the last 6 months and never did I just cried every day..still do... I still have fellings specifically for her not the things we did together or a good times with her I wanna smell her hair again and hug her even that I know we might never do that anymore.

I love my kid with all I have and will love the other one too and even if it ever came to that that me and my current gf break up I would do anything to take care of them, pay for stuff they need, bring them along everywhere I go. I know for a fact too that she would want me to see them that she wouldn’t like hold grudges or prevent me from seeing them. I'm just so scared of her first reaction cause I know how she can get...

So yeah that’s my problem (a pretty freaking big one or maybe not for some of you) and I’m sorry I’m all over the place in my post cause English is not my first language but I don’t know where else to go before I seek professional help. So yeah that’s it, I’ll probably get allot of hate comments but still hoping for some people with same or even kinda like experience.

  
Emotionally I'm on edge, feels almost like a depression rn and I would be glad for any comment I get here... Thanks :/ ",0,1728673280.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

- my worst usher shift ever involved me finding two used condoms in a cup holder (movie was oppenheimer if anyone wants to know) and then immediately after that stepping in vomit in the next theater and having to clean that up (for the millionth time, why is there so much vomit)


- as a supervisor i had to try to deescelate a confrontation between two grown men, which then turned into a physical fight and one of the guys threw our trashcan at the other. my manager wasn’t helping and security didn’t show up that day. my manager ended up making me escort both men out separately (i am a 5’7 and 115lb woman and these were giant grown men) and one of the guys kept telling me i was lucky he didn’t have his g*n


-national cinema day we had to kick out over 400 people, mostly teens, who then went to nearby businesses and started fighting people working at these random businesses. we had police cars everywhere and a helicopter circling the building. one of my teenage crew members also got slapped in the face by some kid. another manager got tripped and punched


- had a guy throw coffee on me because i asked to retry to scan his ticket after my greeter told me his ticket wasn’t working


- my boss was electrocuted on a wire in the ceiling while trying to change a light, the shock was so strong that it broke his shoulder and burned off his fingertips

does this stuff ever happen to you guys? do i work in a world of horror? this is just some of the stories, i could go on and on

1g1h7bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1g1h7bs/rating_the_dishes_ive_eaten_in_dining_halls/,Rating the Dishes I’ve Eaten in Dining Halls,"Here is a non-extensive subjective rating of everything I’ve eaten at the dining halls to hopefully help you decide what to eat on campus with the dining dollars that they shove down your throat! 



**1000/10 - Steamed Pork Bun (Wok this Way @64 Degrees):** ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My favorite thing I’ve had so far. This was just so tasty. The flavor was great. Everything was cooked well. The pairing of the bun with the pork is the best. Please order this. I could eat like literally 10 of these in one sitting OMG. 



**1000/10 - Crispy BBQ Chicken Sandwich (Rooftop @Sixth College):** This sandwich is absolutely delectable. It’s everything a chicken sandwich should be. Of course it’s no Dave’s Hot Chicken (The ultimate god of everything chicken), but for on campus food, this is one of the best things I’ve eaten so far. Maybe I’m biased because of how much I seemingly love chicken, but this was really stinking good. 



**10/10 - Pan Fried Noodles (Wok this Way @64 Degrees):** Really good! Everything you’d expect out of noodles like this. A great side dish to get with something else here. If you put soy sauce and, if you like spicy, some sriracha on them they taste even better! 



**10/10 - Spicy Meat Lovers Pizza (Scholar’s Pizza @OVT):** Scholar’s Pizza has never disappointed me yet, and it for sure didn’t with this one. This pizza is everything you want in a good pizza and is large! If you have a fridge in your dorm, you could even take this home and heat it up and get two meals out of it. I highly recommend trying this, it’s scrumptious! 



**9.5/10 - Garlic Wild Mushroom Pizza (Scholar’s Pizza @OVT):** This pizza also did not fail to disappoint! No major complaints, the only reason I docked some is because this time two of the slices did not have much toppings on them. I’m sure this isn’t a regular occurrence though and was just due to the fast pace of the pizzas having to be made. 



**9.5/10 - Harissa Chicken Fries (Journey @Ventanas):** THESE WERE SO GOOD! I went into these having no expectations because I’m unfamiliar with African food, but let me tell you, these were super unique and tasty. Only docking .5 because if you get to the bottom of the fries without leaving the toppings, the fries are bland and seem unsalted. But other than that, I really recommend! 



**9/10 - Falafel Garlic Fries (Spice @OVT):** These were super good! The falafel part might turn some people off if you don’t like it, but it was my first time trying it and I enjoyed it! It’s for sure an acquired taste, but it won’t hurt to try it because if you like it you might find something amazing. Only docking off 1 point because it needed more sauce. The bits without sauce felt so empty and plain. 



**9/10 - Cold Brew (Counter Culture @OVT):** Your basic cold brew. Can’t really go too wrong with it, but it’s not unique or the best coffee ever. Still do recommend though. 



**8/10 - Pulled Pork Sandwich (Rooftop @Sixth College):** Pretty good! Nothing much to say other than it’s not the godsend that is the chicken sandwich, so I likely won’t be ordering this much, but it was good! 



**8/10 - Waffle Fries (Rooftop @Sixth College):** These were good for waffle fries and I can recommend them. The only problem is they’re often either a bit undercooked or a bit overcooked. However, if you look over this, they’re pretty great. 



**8/10 - Muffin Blueberry (Counter Culture @OVT):** Pretty good pastry for breakfast or if you just want something sweet. No major complaints, but it’s not revolutionary or inventive, so that’s why it only gets an 8. 



**8/10 - White Mocha (Audrey’s Cafe @Geisel Library):** Wasn’t bad! Pretty tasty. Although, I have had better coffee, but this is a very convenient spot if you are already in the library. 



**7/10 - Old World Pepperoni Detroit Pizza (Scholar’s Italian @OVT):** This pizza was fine. Nothing too special about it, but it’s not bad if you want something on the smaller and cheaper side. However, Scholar’s Pizza is WAY better, so just get that instead. 



**7/10 - OV Side Salad (Scholar’s Italian @OVT):** Okay salad. A bit small for the price. Nothing too unique. The croutons were weird too, they seemed homemade, but tasted very bland. 



**6/10 - Crispy Chicken Sandwich (Soul @Ventanas):** Fine chicken sandwich, but I always feel like it’s missing something whenever I eat it. It’s not bad, just feels empty. I think it might be because the Rooftop chicken sandwich is just so much better, so I recommend going there if you can, but if you can’t this chicken sandwich isn’t the worst. 



**6/10 - Turkey Cranberry Sandwich (64 Garden Bar @64 Degrees):** I mean it didn’t taste bad, but the pairing was just odd to me. It had like- stuffing on it(?) that wasn’t listed in the app and it was strange eating that cold. The bread was also a bit soggy. Probably wouldn’t get it again, but it wasn’t gross or inedible, just strange and a new experience. 



**5/10 - Turkey Meatball Sub (Scholar’s Italian @OVT):** This was fine. It was filling and edible. At least it wasn’t gross. However, the ingredients tasted cheap. They had an empty flavor, as if they needed more seasoning or something. 



**5/10 - Rainbow Roll (Umi @64 Degrees)**: Gosh. This sushi has for sure been frozen at some point. It was so chewy and hard to bite into. The only way you are eating this thing is if you eat each piece in one bite. Other than that, the flavor of the sushi was decent enough, so it still gets a five. Plus, it is the only sushi option on campus as far as I know. 

  


**5/10 - Potato Wedges (Soul @Ventanas):**  Not great. The waffle fries at Rooftop are better. They’re fine, but again just lacking seasoning. 



**4/10 - Fall Side Salad (64 Garden Bar @64 Degrees):** Wasn’t that bad, but it was EXTREMELY overdressed and didn’t have croutons or anything, so it was generally lacking a crunch that I wish it had. Probably would order the caesar as my side salad instead next time. 



**3/10 - Mac and Cheese (Soul @Ventanas):** It’s fine I guess, but tastes like poorly homemade mac. The real problem is the cheese. It needs MORE CHEESE. Cheese fiends will not be satisfied by this and nor was I. 



**2/10 - Veggie Avocado Bagel (Counter Culture @OVT):** Terrible. Was bland as ever. Needed some salt or something. It was even really hard to eat because the bagel is so stiff and is filled too much, so it falls apart. Only giving it 2 because it’s a good vegetarian option if you find that you somehow like it, but mostly don’t recommend. 



**0/10 - Wolftown Burrito (Wolftown @Sixth College):** Terrible. I wanted to rate this a negative too, but only the brisket sandwich can hold that title for me. Firstly, not only is the burrito bad, but I had the worst ordering experience with them. I understand that the dining halls are often understaffed and, since it is the beginning of the quarter, a lot of them are new hires. However, I just can’t excuse the amount of workers I saw standing around doing nothing when the manager was right there and could’ve given them tasks. I waited an hour for this. Besides that, it didn’t even taste good! It was cold. The worst thing is that they didn’t even spread the ingredients around, so the last 1/4th of my burrito was all guac! Don’t recommend this. Wish I could though, I wanted a good burrito for the time I wasted and the money I spent. 



**-1000/10 - Brisket Sandwich (Rooftop @Sixth College):** Disgusting. The only thing on this list that I will say was practically inedible. It was strange to me that Rooftop is able to have one of my favorite dishes and my least favorite. The brisket was not cut well, so I got many bites that were very fatty. The flavor was plain too. It was hot in some places and cold in others. It fell apart because it was overstuffed and I even felt a bit embarrassed eating it. Don’t order this. Gross. 



So, overall, some of the food here is generally really tasty and some is not. It’s a very mixed bag depending on what you order and the day you order it. I feel like the main complaint is that everything just needs more seasoning! A lot of the dishes would just taste so much better if they had even some salt or something. Also, a more personal gripe (as a California local my whole life) is that I wish there were more good Mexican places! However, I need to get around to trying Taqueria because it’s likely better than the mess that is Wolftown. Maybe it is what I am looking for. 



Also a general comment on the university’s dining dollar policy: the fact that meal plans are still required is insane to me. People should be able to choose if they would like it or not. It feels like another shill to get more money flowing through the university. Also, prices are insane. I understand that inflation is bad and the prices of ingredients are wild, but I feel like there should be some solution to get these dishes to the lowest price possible due to the fact that most students do not have a ton of money. 



Lastly, keep in mind these are all subjective opinions. Whether you like some food or not is up to you and not worth arguments. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments!

1g1h4wr,https://i.redd.it/01rwpgchb6ud1.jpeg,I hate the entitled boomers in my town,"Just need to vent. I live in a tiny farm town, about 10K people in it. I moved here from a very big city about 2 years ago. Today is a nice Friday, I had the day off work and figured I'd go to the local coffee shop for an iced coffee. The coffee shop is right next door to a physical therapy office. I parked right in front of the physical therapy office as there were no signs saying it was just for those customers. All it said was ""2 hour parking"" - so I go in, coffee shop is busy, I'm in there for about 15 minutes waiting for my drink. It comes out, I go to my car, check a message on my phone (which took about 30seconds) and I turned my car on and opened the window. Put my seatbelt on. As I'm about to leave, a car passed mine, did a u turn, then parked on the opposite side of the street as me. While it does this, the guys yells a rude ""THANKS"" out his window. At this point I didn't know what he said, so I pulled out of the parking spot, turned around and pulled up next to his car and I say ""excuse me sir, what did you say?"" This man then goes on a yelling rant about how he waited 20 minutes for me to move my car. I explained I was in the coffee shop and just got out, that it was public parking, and the sign said the parking time limit is 2 hours. Then he goes ""WELL YOU CAN GO CHECK YOUR EMAILS SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!""  sir I wasn't even checking emails but ok 

This man was legit uset with me for parking in the spot he felt entitled to park in, when it was literally public street parking. Just because it's a small town doesn't mean you are entitled to a particular spot. He had to park directly across the street from his destination. Boo hoo. 

These boomers say millennials are snowflakes but then they go doing this shit.... 

After much of his irate yelling I yelled back that it's ""2 hour public street parking, you idiot"" and then drove off.
I wish I calmly called him out about how he's being entitled, that the world doesn't revolve around him. Clearly the world has never checked this guy. 

*picture of the street parking in question, on the right hand side* Anyone think that street parking looks reserved for one person? It's also funny bc there were other spots open. He wanted specifically the one directly in front of the PT office. 

I'm tempted to call the physical therapy place to tell them they should make a reserved parking spot for their clientele because their clients are yelling at customers of other nearby businesses about the parking. 

I hate the small minded boomers of this town. The wild thing is, I've NEVER seen the silent generation act this way. Those folks understand the world doesn't revolve around them and always have shown me respect and kindness. This whole interaction made me really miss my grandparents born in 1928, I wish I could tell them about this and get their thoughts, but I'm pretty certain they would have told me to say ""to hell with you"" to that guy and be on my way. 

I've always had a soft spot for the elderly but I'm realizing that it's the silent generation I had a soft spot for, not the elderly. As the boomers become elderly they're showing this entitled rudeness more and more, and I'm going to check them. They're gonna be in for a hell of a surprise when the boomers are all in nursing homes and millennial / gen z staff are gonna check them. Plus, their children probably hate them with an attitude like that. I do have to maybe try to give this rude boomer the benefit of the doubt - maybe he's just sad lonely and poor, and no one in his family likes him and he has no friends bc he's simply an ass. Idk. I've spent 3 hours being mad and stewing about this so hopefully getting it out in writing will make me no longer waste my day off being angry about a rude stranger. I need to go draw or something. 

Ok rant over

Firebird is a bit of a quiet underdog on this sub, probably bc it’s a small catalog and tbh because they restock infrequently. I get it. But I think their scents are beautifully straightforward and well crafted, and several of my favorites are from this house (hello, Cake and Green Lemon!).

They just stocked for fall, with the promise of soap and lotion coming soon.

Notes: damp earth, wet leaves, patchouli, cedarwood, vetiver*)
- **Burning Leaves** (*The smoky scent of burning leaves, carried on the chilly fall air. Notes: fallen leaves, smoldering branches, woodsmoke*)
- **Spellbound** (*Spellbound is an intoxicating blend of warm pumpkin cake (spiced with clove and nutmeg), rich vanilla, bulgarian lavender, maple, tonka, and a bewitching swirl of of amber. Notes: pumpkin cake, vanilla, lavender buds, maple, tonka, amber*)
- **Black Moon** (*Forest gathering. Moonless night. Magic in the air. Tendrils of caramelized sugar and swirling blue smoke, spiked with herbs and woods. A bewitching blend of smoked lavender, licorice candy, burnt sugar, charred wood, and glowing embers: dark, sugared, and mysterious. Notes: smoked lavender, licorice candy, burnt sugar, charred wood, glowing embers*)
- **Counting Stars** (*The scent of camping in late fall: wind rustling through dry leaves, pine needles crunching underfoot, smoky campfire sending sparks up into the chilly night air, wrapped in your warmest wool blanket, silently watching the stars. Notes: fir needle, balsam, lavender, campfire smoke, a warm blanket*)
- **Elixir** (*Elixir is a blend of strong black coffee and dark cocoa, spiced with cardamom, ginger and cassia, sprinkled with a bit of raw sugar and deepened with smoky vetiver root. Notes: black coffee, dark cocoa, cardamom, ginger, cassia, raw sugar, vetiver*)
- **Bonfire Cider** (*It's apple harvest time! Pick your own, filling baskets with red and gold and green. Don't forget to try some fresh pressed cider, topped with a caramel drizzle. Bonfires roaring, smoke curling overhead, leaves explode in a riot of color. The air turns chilly and brisk. Notes: crushed cider apples, sticky caramel, burning leaves, crisp fall air*)
- **Ritual** (*Soot and smoke and bitter herbs, dusty wooden floorboards creaking underfoot, the darkest aged patchouli, a haze of sandalwood incense. Notes: dusty wood, burning sage, aged patchouli, sandalwood incense, purifying smoke*)

I got Counting Stars and Black Moon, and already own Elixir (it is stunning!!!!) and now I’m wondering if I should have gotten Burning Leaves as well. Someone talk me out of this lol.",13,1728672451.0,Indiemakeupandmore,3,1.0,False

1g1gype,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1g1gype/pietro_pro_grinder_wow/,Pietro Pro Grinder - Wow,"I recently received the Pietro Pro Grinder and am way more impressed with it than I had expected.

I acknowledge I may have a grinder problem. I think a good grinder is one of the things that can lead to consistency and good pour-overs.  Flavor-wise, I go for more clarity than a full-bodied profile. At home, I use an Option-O P64 with the Mizen Omni burrs, but I have been really looking for a new manual grinder to take when I am on the road, and I was especially looking for something special for a family trip coming up in a couple of months to make awesome coffee when away from home.

I have a Comandante c40 , Knock Feld47, 1Zpresso ZP6, and Orphan Expresso Lido OG. Based on watching and reading a bunch of reviews, and especially Lance Hedrick's summary table:

(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-g7bi7ExsW9R5leXS9--mQ9KG25jlWZm0Iu-tC\_Z4YuWY-dzfp3ENGsmTS8tt8sewCankEi4yo\_Ms/pubhtml)

I thought the Pietro might be the grinder that hit my sweet spot, being it really emphasized the clarity of the cup.  After looking at all the reviews, I decided I was willing to put up with the possible nuisance of the ergonomics and the hassle of taking off the lid if it produced an exceptional tasting result.  I found it at Expresso Parts with an online coupon for $427.

Long and short of it, I was really surprised at how solid and well-built a grinder it is. All the tolerances are right on. The handle snaps in and out of place with magnets, as does the bottom grinds receptacle. The grind adjustment clicks satisfyingly from one step to the next. As others have said, the airtight lid on top is a pain to take off, but it holds an impressive amount of coffee in both the top and in the bottom grinds chamber, more than any other grinder I own. I have read that some put Vaseline along the edge to facilitate taking it off, but there are grooves front and back for your fingernails which work for me. The grinder is larger but not too large to take on a road trip (9"" x 4.5"" x 3.1"" and 3.45#).  I have several bags on order to see which one will fit best to throw in the truck and protect it.

As others have pointed out on their reviews, the grinding process it a little awkward, but really do-able if you go into it with eyes open.  The grinder sits solidly on the counter, and you turn the handle towards the counter's edge, and it is no issue to grind, and it grinds really quickly.  I have found if you give it a little tap after it seems done, there is often a little more in there to grind. not sure how it relates to it's unique vertically oriented flat burrs.  The end result, at least for me, is that the flavor of the resulting brew is sublime with clarity, sweetness, with distinct flavor separation unlike anything I have gotten from one of my other grinders.",3,1728672242.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I’d like to vent a bit as well as hear from you if you struggle with similar, and if you have any advice I’d appreciate it so much. 

I was diagnosed as autistic a couple years ago but only just started treatment for adhd 6 months ago. 

My issues could also be more related to autism than I realize. 

My issue is this: Even if I simply use the bathroom or go to get more water or coffee/tea, or get the mail- anything, I still find it hard to re-focus. And it’s like everything distracts me at all times. 

Prior to medication, me doing any of those things meant my day was over. Period. The rest of the day would be a mindless struggle of accomplishing nothing. If I was productive for even 20 minutes straight too, the day would be over. 

I feel like things got more difficult as the years went on and my stress increased from life. I used to be able to go an hour and a half in a great state of flow, but that was it. The rest of the day was a struggle where I’d be at my desk struggling to get anything done. I work from home part time, but also create art in my free time. So that’s what I’m doing during working hours and even on weekends at times. Also: that hour and a half was always excitement to create. Then, fizzle out. And if I felt hungry or anything- that was it, it was over. 

I feel like since starting medication that yes, my brain is working better and performing better, it is by no means a magic pill. 

As a matter of fact, now that I’ve been taking it for several months, my point of reference (no meds, no knowledge of how they help me) is fading. So I’m left with feeling like I’m still having major issues. 

Is this unavoidable with adhd with autism? I am trying to work on accepting that I will never get as much done as I’d like, and that I will ALWAYS work slow. 

I switch up my days as well, I have my hand dipped in so many different activities, particularly gardening. I can do things I don’t need to be doing, but it’s too hard to stick with stuff I want to do as well as need to do. 

I do best with physical things like cleaning (it depends) and gardening. 

I don’t know how to let it all go. I almost want to slap myself in the face it frustrates me so much to be at my desk and want to instead get up or melt my brain on my phone looking things up or researching things. My brain never wants to do what I truly want and need to do. 

I’m looking for advice or understanding, I want to figure this out. Every day feels like a disappointment. But it’s been better since getting help. I think I also may need a break from the meds, but boy do I feel a difference. I feel like I’m screwing myself if I don’t take the medication. I suppose that is when I see how well it helps me. 

I just want to finish something in an afternoon like everyone else. My brain just won’t let me. Something that takes most people a couple hours takes me sometimes a week or more, depending on what it is. I feel like I’m always running in place and I’ve tried everything, including giving up, which is way worse. ",2,1728672089.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

I just had a dental checkup and learned I have 3 more cavities to get filled (9 total now).

1g1gufw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/1g1gufw/reviews_from_a_newbie_to_the_genre_and_looking/,Reviews from a newbie to the genre and looking for recommendations.,"I got into the genre after reading Beware of Chicken which is NOT how I would recommend people get into it (You miss a lot of the satire).  But I've been devouring books since then and here are reviews from a newbie who's reading exclusively through released books (no Royal Road).  Since I'm not reading the most up to date stuff, I'm sure some of these reviews will have some dramatic irony because you all know things I don't.  

Rubric: I'm going to give each book a total score based on how it comes together in parts.  Each part gets a x/3 score with 1 being poor, 2 being acceptable, and 3 being great.

Reviews are presented in my reading order.

#Minor spoliers for the books reviewed with major spoilers in spoiler text.


**Beware of Chicken Books 1-3**

A very odd book to enter the genre on I feel, since now that I'm more familiar with the genre I'm sure I would get more out of it.  Overall a great and cozy read and I'm very pleased that the story is moving forward without feeling like its abandoning the roots of the first book.  

Score: 

- Characters: 2/3 - All the characters are intersting and enjoyable, but there's a lot of them and thus far (through book 3) most of them are just starting on their arcs.  The MC in particular I'm sure has a lot more growth to go through that I'm excited to see but haven't seen yet.
- Plot: 2/3 - Good ideas if a bit wandering.  The third book moved the story in a good direction but I would have enjoyed more focus on fewer characters.  I think the size of the cast is part of what is hurting the plot, since there's only so much time to devote to each character.
- Worldbuilding: 3/3 - There's a lot of fun things here and I'm sure there's a lot of inspiration from other books in the genre.
- The leveling ""System"": 1/3 - Xianxia tropes and system were fresh to me on the first read so that could be coloring it but now that I've read through a few more books I find the system overall to be poorly fleshed out, and for this book, I think that's ok since it feels like a bit of a response to an established set of tropes.  
- Prose Quality: 2/3 - Overall well written.  The anachronistic words used frequently for descriptions, similies, and expression hurt the overall quality but is forgivable since if it's coming from an isekai'd MC from Canada it's not really anachronistic but the portions of the story written from other perspectives, especially in the third book, show less flexibility that I'd have liked to see with lanuage.  Decent descriptions and tone setting but I'd like to see more.
- Theme & Conflict: 3/3 - For this story, the theme and conflicts are perfect.  It feels cozy because the stakes seem low and the MC's goals are so humble, but the building significance in the plot really makes things shine and the evolution from something cozy and flippant to something serious is well handled without losing all of that coziness.

*Overall Score: 13/18*


**Heretical Fishing**

Often recommend by people when someone asks for something after Beware of Chicken, it has some of the same coziness but the overall quality is much, much lower in my opinion and this is a DNF the series for me, I put it down after completing the first book and won't be returning.  The anachronistic prose and clumsy style really made this a chore to read for me and I scored it very poorly because of that.  It also commits the same sin as Beware of Chicken in that the FIRST woman that the MC meets is the love interest and the first book spends way to much time clumsily exploring that relationship.  

Score: 

- Characters: 1/3 - Mostly flat and uninteresting.  Fischer in particular has very little personality and growth. 
- Plot: 1/3 - Completely all over the place and really hurts from not having a good antagonist.   I especially hated the conflict with the coffee shop owner in the rich part of town which just felt like a thinley veiled insert of ""capitalism bad"".  The conflict with the George the lord of the town is the best bit of plotting and could have been developed into a good plot but it's dealt with quickly.
- Worldbuilding: 1/3 - Cool concept but mostly poorly explained.  We know that fish, even unseasoned, just tastes so amazing but it's never really explained why.  Maybe this is covered in the later books but it's not discussed significantly in the first book. Not enough to hook me in and make me curious about the world.
- The leveling ""System"": 1/3 - This has a thin varnish of leveling over the top of the plot.  The leveling is never focused on, there are no leveling challenges, the story never requires or relies on levels, I'm not sure this even counts as progression fantasy since the progression just comes.  Fischer's ability to manifest superior goods and even a house out of nothing is interesting but completely OP since we don't see anyone else doing it. 
- Prose Quality: 1/3 - Very poor.  It never shows when it can tell.  The descriptions are boring and clichéd.  Most action is described with very short, declartives.  A lot of is/are/was/were when a different style with more interesting verbs would keep the story going along.  To quote a romanitc passage near the end of the book: *Spoiler* >!""She giggled and covered her mouth, then leaned forward once more. Grabbing the back of my neck with one hand, she pulled me forward and pressed her lips against mine. They were softer than velvet warmer and more comforting than the sun's rays. The moment lasted an eternity yet was over too soon"".!<  That passage is a prefect example of everything I have a probelm with in the prose.
- Theme & Conflict: 1/3 - As previously mentioned the conflict with George the lord is good and the most enjoyable conflict in the book but the rest of the conflicts are predictable with low stakes and boring results.  I never felt like Fischer was ever in danger of losing at any time.  The themes started out pretty cozy and interesting and I was excited to get into learning all about the different fish and discovering the magic system but that theme swiftly went away into a mix of economic class warfare, romance, and cultists, none of which were well displayed.  

*Overall Score: 6/18 - Lowest score possible.*

**Cradle**

The most recommended series to the point that it's a meme.  It's a great series to get started with and I think would be a great entry point for anyone looking to get into the genre.  This series holds very few surprises but its a comfortable, constant progression that marches to a satisfying ending without taking too many side arcs, losing the core of the appeal of the first books, or having any low/slow spots.  The absolute bright spot are all of characters and how much you come to care for them and enjoy them.

Score: 

- Characters: 3/3 - Best part of the series and strongest reason to keep reading.  Lindon is a bit of a blank slate but Yerrin, Eithan, Mercy, Dross, and Orthos are standout characters that all have great arcs and bring great flavor to the series and make you want more.  My only complaint is that their arcs all feel a bit rushed in the final books.  The antagonists, especially Reigan Shen, Malice, and Northstrider are very interesting and fun.  The early antagonists are a bit forgetable but that's ok in the context of the entire series.  
- Plot: 3/3 - Very satisfying plotting with each new challenge feeling necessary and each victory feeling earned.   Lindon losing sometimes is a huge boon to raising the stakes of the story and *major spoiler* >!Him losing an arm only for it to become crucial to his progression is exactly what I love about his genre!<.  I love that all of the characters can turn their failures into success or at least learning experiences.  
- Worldbuilding: 3/3 - Really great world building especially because you keep being surprised at how far up the power level goes and reaching each new level of power is well thought out and very interesting.  The explanation for power disparity is very satisfying, especially as it ties back into the overall plot.  The nesting of the different powerlevels really is the key that makes this world so compelling and interesting and it's well excecuted.  
- The leveling ""System"": 2/3 - The weakest part of the books in my opinion.  There's very little exploration of the system as a whole and Lindon follows a very linear path.  Power increases are mostly glossed over with a few notable important achievements that make for very the most interest parts of the books: *major spoilers* >!Lindon getting the bloodforged iron body and his finding and construction of Dross is by far the parts of the books that I enjoyed the most.!<
- Prose Quality: 2/3 - Decent but forgetable.  The descriptions overall could have been a lot more vibrant and the dialogue was sometimes very wooden, mostly from Lindon.  There were no real standout moments where I noticed the prose being good or bad, which is just fine.
- Theme & Conflict: 2/3 - While the Theme was excellent the conflicts were mostly very clearly stated or predictable.  *minor spoiler* >!Reigan Shen and the conflict with him being the most compelling.!<.  The overall theme, when you really look at the series as a whole is not very compelling, but this series is more about the journey and exploring different themes isn't as important to enjoyment.  *Major Spoliers* >!Orthos and Dross have the most compelling themes, since both of them are exploring their identity and how they do and do not let that be defined by others.  Orthos's exploration of that is never resolved, he's a living no true scottsman falacy that would have been fascinating to explore.  Dross is similar in that he is rebuilding his personality but that journey goes from manic scientist to annoying edgelord and then just settles back in to manic scientist!!<

Overall Score: 15/18

**Arcane Ascension Books 1-4**
A lot of progression fantasy has a strong bend toward YA and sometimes it's hard to give a book a fair shake because it's very clearly written for or from a young person's perspective.  Less forgivable is a very clear self-insert or brining anacronistic morals to a fantasy world with little justification.  Arcane assention gets very, very close to being intollerable on both of these issues but pulls it back just enough to not become unbearable.  By book four most of that conflict is in the past and we're back into the more interesting parts of the story.  Overall I think Arcane is a book that is good despite its flaws, but I would not be surprised if it's not for everyone.

Score: 

- Characters: 2/3 - The characters overall are just ok but not becauase they are bland.  There are parts of the characters which really stnad out and make you want more, but there isn't a character in the story that doesn't have some incredibly annoying aspect that makes you want to skip their parts of the story.  *spoiler*>!Sera in particular can get super preachy without really having earned it and is by far the most annoying character, but I think that is more by design than by accident and it does lead to interesting moments in the plot, so it's not completley indispensible.!<.  Interestingly I think the minor characters have more compelling and setting appropriate character traits and reactions but it might just be the I don't enjoy the YA characters.  The romance and harrem aspects are very cringe and almost feel like satire or clumsy addendums.  
- Plot: 3/3 - Lots going on here and all of it interesting while being relevant and supporting of a larger, overall plot.  The side arcs are all interesting and feel necessary to the larger story.  The only thing I wish was better handled was the interludes between the intense action.  *minor spoiler* >!Corin's 2nd year of school is mostly un-described to the point that it almost lowers the score for the plot.  I would have enjoyed a LOT more school and class interludes, even if they were just short little descriptions or allusions to classes ""off-screen""!<
- Worldbuilding: 3/3 - Very good world building.  The world feels deep and wide, with lots more to explore and going from one spire to another and seeing something completely different is really great.  The exploration of magic as a technology and developing that into something more is a great aspect to any magical world in my opinion and it's well done here.  The feeling of looming dangers and more powerful magic waiting somewhere out in the world is also a great theme and really makes the world feel interesting and alive.  
- The leveling ""System"": 1/3 - Overall very bland if you take it as a system.  Increasing mana to level and aquiring new attunements are just ok and mostly happen off screen.  As a system, there are very few moments where the characters reach a threshold in the system and suddenly gain interesting power.  It's borderline between 1 and 2 but most of the power increases in the story come from creative use of powers rather than the system itself.  That's not a bad thing but it really takes the focus off of the progression part of the story, which is what having a system is all about.  
- Prose Quality: 2/3 - Decent if you account for the YA tone.  It feels strongly anachronistic for a novel that doesn't have and isekai character that can bring those anachronisms to a fantasy world without it feeling misplaced.  The descriptions overall are mostly middling but there are some standouts and the descriptions of the fights are a standout of the series.  
- Theme & Conflict: 2/3 - This series is all over the place and I think the author's voice is causing a stress between the themes and the setting.  The explicit conflict and theme of the books is lost behind the implicit themes about consent, personhood, and identity.  Those themes are worthy but they feel very much out of place in a feudal, victorian-esque society with explicit slavery of other sentients and it's never really explained how this younger generation got their morals. 

Overall score: 13/18


Other books that I've read but not reviewed yet (why did I even start writing these reviews?):
 
- Into the Labyrinth: Mage Errant - Book 1: I might read more, didn't hook me, but I did finish it.

- Last Horizon - Book 1: Won't be continuing this series, I don't find it compelling and I don't really think it fits in as progression fantasy.  

- Magic 2.0 - Book 1: Very interesting concept but very shallow and mostly focused on unlikable characters with little else going for it.  I might continue it but that's doubtful.  

- He Who Fights with Monsters - Books 1-11: Definitely will read the rest of the series as the books are released.  It has flaws, but overall was a great read for me.

- Jake's Magical Market: Liked the first 25%, hated the rest of it.  Skimmed the last half of the book to see if we got back to the market and then gave up.  Needs to be retitled Jake's Rambling adventure.  Will not read more by this author.

- Bog Standard Isekai - Books 1-2: Just finished this and really, really liked it.  Very excited to read more of this and would love more recommendations from people who also loved this series.  Strong characters, great plot, interesting system, it's probably the best of what I've read so far, but needs to keep that tenor through the end of the series to match something like Cradle.",3,1728671926.0,ProgressionFantasy,0,0.8,False

Last weekend, I decided to find out and drove from Istanbul to Bodrum. Here’s what I experienced.

The first thing I noticed was the silence. It felt strange at first not hearing the constant engine noise from a gas-powered car, but after a while, I found myself embracing this quiet. Especially when I hit the highway, it was amazing to trust the car’s Autopilot system and just enjoy the view.

Stopping at Superchargers along the way was another eye-opener. It showed me just how solid Tesla’s infrastructure is. Every time I stopped, I grabbed a coffee while the car charged and even chatted with other Tesla owners. This community truly enhances your appreciation for the vehicle.

Another thing that stood out during the long drive was the comfort of the Model Y. I drove for hours without feeling fatigued at all. It’s already a pleasure to drive in the city, but on long trips, that enjoyment is multiplied.

I was worried about charging, but Tesla’s Supercharger network made that concern disappear. Everything was well-planned, and my trip went smoothly without any issues.

In short, my first long road trip with the Tesla Model Y exceeded my expectations. If anyone has doubts about Tesla’s electric future, one experience like this is enough to make them vanish. The sense of freedom and the technology I felt on this trip is something everyone should experience.",8,1728671808.0,TeslaModelY,1,1.0,False
1g1gry4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g1gry4,How to use “Extra” Living Room Space,"We recently purchased our first home and after living in apartments, we have a lot of furniture to buy! I really want to take my time with that and get settled into the house before we make any big purchases, but I would like to have a ""vision"" of what types of furniture and decor will be needed. I think I have an idea for most rooms, but our living room is really throwing me for a loop. We have this extra space in the living room where the fireplace is and I'm just not sure how to use it. The TV and console is across from the couch and while I'm open to moving that and the couch, I have a hard time picture it anywhere else. (The TV is against the wall of the staircase, which isn't very wide.) Across from the fireplace is open into the breakfast nook/kitchen. Please disregard the things on the mantel, the wall art is for my son' room and the other things are just hanging out there for now. :)

A few initial thoughts:

* I'd love to have bookshelves in the living room, but where? I initally thought that we could use the extra living room space as a reading nook, but I feel like the room is just slightly too small for that. I envisioned breaking up the room in some way so we could use a second large rug in front of the fireplace but our other rug is just big enough that that might not work. I have a hard time visualizing things, so I need help haha!
* I would like to find new storage for our vinyls and a space higher up for our record player. We have a 14-month-old who is very active and is infatuated with opening the lid of the record player. I'd like to get that away from little hands!
* A few items off the top of my head that I would like to get for this room: lamps/some sort of ambient lighting, end tables (will two feel crowded?), coffee table, curtains, wall art
* On the note of curtains, all of our windows have built-in curtain rods on toward the top of the window frames. My google searching tells me that curtains should be hung higher. What is the general consensus on this?

Any insight would be appreciated! We are so excited to be in our new home and I appreciate any help in creating a vision for this room.",1,1728671736.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

I only have 10x15g so I hope to get it dialed in with the first three cups.

El Mirador carefully processes coffee and uses modern methods in its work. The Caffi's natural-processed Orange Bourbon imparts a strong fruitiness and sweet citrus flavor, along with a jam-like aftertaste of plum. The result is remarkable. Orange Bourbon is a natural coffee that is dried with the fruit flesh intact. The fruit flesh is mechanically removed from around the bean, leaving wild notes in the coffee and giving it a heavier mouthfeel. The coffee is excellent in a drip brewer, but a skilled barista can also create outstanding espresso drinks from it.

This continued through middle school through high school and a little bit into community college. Since I dealt with their abusive behavior, my mental health. 3 years ago, my parents and I got into a heated argument, insinuating one of my friends wanted money from me. For context, me and my friend were in a Walgreens or Lucky's, and I was just asking due to me not knowing I could withdraw money from my bank account from one of the self-checkout machines. Later, after I was done hanging out with my friend after getting coffee with them at a Starbucks, I walked home. When I arrived home, both my parents were not in a bad mood until they asked the question about why I withdrew money and if someone had forced me to. I tried explaining, but my father got upset and struck me several times with a golf club. I pushed my mother to the side before not thinking, just reacting to the situation. That occurred on September 17th, 2021, and I was 18 at this time. For context as well, my parents are temperamental and have low patience. I am not the favorite due to having an older sister who graduated from Berekley who did not have to face this abuse. Later, similar situations would occur where my abusers would investigate situations causing me to get mad, then film me without my permission and threaten to kick me out and call the cops on me. And recently, in the first week of October 2024, I was yelled at by my abusers for not finishing the dishes. Keep in mind at this point I am 21 and a community college student sophomore year with 1 more year until I go to university once I do my applications. My mother caused the scene by screaming, and my father came into my room unannounced and told me, “Shut the fuck up!” After I yelled stop touching my belongings, he and the other abuser justified their actions by stating they own this house, which is true, so they can do whatever they want. The argument then switched to why I didn’t clean my room; later, my 1st abuser (my father) walked towards me toward the bathroom portion of the room and slapped me in the face after I yelled “Fuck off!”. Later, he followed me into the garage portion of the house due to my wanting some space to cool off. Then later he threatened to call the cops on me and recorded me with his phone again without my permission. And this was when I got sick from someone in one of my courses at a community college, but he used it against me, stating you've been sleeping all day; don’t try to gaslight me on how you're going out to meet your friends. I got invited to go play pickleball with friends from the same community college but couldn’t make it in the end.

This morning she has been acting weird, jumping on the bed and waking me up early (which she rarely does unless she needs something). I wanted to cuddle her but she didn’t like it too much which isn’t normal. I picked her up and I noticed that her fur was smelly around the neck area. I had never seen this. It’s nice she hasn’t groomed for a while. I tried to use some cat shampoo there but she didn’t like it and hid underneath the coffee table. She rarely does that.
I have also noticed that she slept a lot. She has slept all day and all night yesterday. But she was doing good, purring and playing with her toy yesterday.

**Fast Facts:**

  
- It started in 1863.

- It currently has over 21 million members in 212 countries.

- It has a health code similar to the word of wisdom.  But they actually emphasize healthy eating a lot more than mormons who tend to just focus on coffee, smoking and drinking.  Whereas the adventists really try to eat more of a plant based diet, which is also in the WOW but largely ignored.

- They believe in the second coming.  The founders were in another group which had predicted a coming of Jesus in 1844 but disappointing were wrong.  Kind of like many mormon prophetic predictions.

- They run schools with more than 1.8 million students.

- They run health systems with 733 health care entities worldwide.

- It is the most radically diverse church in the united states.

My late storytelling,"For some time, I've wanted to express my gratitude to this community for the unwavering support during moments of uncertainty on my CPA journey. Though not an active participant, I've absorbed every relatable story shared here. This post is dedicated to those who often feel inadequate.

I began my CPA journey in December 2023 and received my final results in September 2024, achieving 4/4. Reading countless success stories here, I often felt like an impostor compared to others. Many overcame unbelievable odds—parenting multiple children, managing illnesses, and juggling full-time jobs—while still passing in 3-4 months. Each story motivated me, making me realize if they could do it, so could I. Despite being a diligent worker with a knack for deep research, exams were my nemesis. Self-doubt was a constant companion.

I want to share a message with anyone who feels similarly: I don't have children, I'm in good health, and I juggled occasional work projects when my focus waned. It took me a 7 months to pass all exams: FAR in January (88), AUD in March (91), REG in June (91), and BEC in July (90). When I finally passed, I struggled to celebrate, feeling I had all the time and resources needed—it didn't feel like a big achievement. 

Truth is we all face our own battles and I know it's wrong to compare yourself to other. I am here to reinforce that message. Some leverage extensive work experience, others have the incredible ability to disconnect from the world issues, and many have walked a long road to find the mental clarity needed to commit to studying. Progress happens step by step—some days are productive, and others are not. The key is to keep moving forward, little by little. When you stumble, just return to your studies the next day. It will be okay.

 My Key Insights and Personal Experiences

1. **Read Comprehensively if that is what makes you feel comfortable**

I’m the type of person who needs to read the book thoroughly before diving into the practice questions. I know many in this group recommend jumping straight into MCQs and learning from mistakes, but that wasn’t my style. I still did plenty of practice questions, but more so to reinforce concepts I might’ve missed from the reading or to ""learn the language of the exam.""

For me, understanding the material came not just from my practice test percentages, but from how confidently I could explain why one answer was right over another. This is how I measured my readiness. It requires time and patience, but it’s my way of learning. If diving directly into MCQs doesn’t work for you, don’t feel pressured to follow the advice just because it's popular.

 (Audit was the exception for me, as the subject came naturally due to my experience in the field.)

**2.  Practice Strategically**

Despite my 7 years background in audit, financial reporting, and financial advisory, I found out quickly that CPA exams demand a different skill set. You can’t assume that just because you know US GAAP from your job, you’re good to go. The exam forces you to jump between unrelated topics in a short amount of time, so mixed practice questions are crucial. Still, because I studies from the book, I haven't practiced thousands and thousands of questions. I think the most I did was for FAR around 800mixed questions in addition to the 683questions included by Becker after each module. 

Some people prefer doing small testlets of 10 questions, but I found that testlets of 100 worked better for me. I’m the kind of person who is better at finishing tasks than starting them, so tackling 100 questions in one go kept me going (i would make a break here and there for a coffee, just press pause button). In contrast, if I had to hit ""generate new testlet"" 10 times, I’d be more likely to quit. Try out different approaches and stick with the one that works for you.

**3. Don’t drag out the process—push yourself to move fast** 

I started casually studying for FAR in August 2023 while waiting for my international evaluation process to be completed. At that time, I wasn’t sure if I’d need more credits before being able to sit for the exam. By the time I registered for my first exam in December, it felt like everything I’d studied in the months before had faded away. For example although firstly I was scoring perfectly on subjects like partnership accounting, it all was gone by December because of the delay. Information that is not used often, is ""deleted"". I heard this advise in a YouTube video of a guy over 50 who took the exams in a span of 3-4months.

 I learned that, especially with a test like this, short-term memory is key—particularly when it comes to understanding how NASBA structures its questions. You might know a subject to perfection and still fail to understand what the question is asking. I was using Becker so my strategy was: practice each question form each individual lesson like (F1 M1), when I completed one full cluster of modules like F1 ""Financial reporting"" (M1-M4), I would do mixed tests. When I finished each lesson in F2 ""Financial reporting disclosures"" I would do mixed tests for F1&F2 and so on.

**4.** **Know Your 'Why'**

This is what got me through the toughest moments. Why are you pursuing the CPA license? For me, it wasn’t a clear-cut reason like ""I want a better job"" or ""I need a higher salary."" I recently moved to the U.S., and given my visa situation, I need sponsorship to keep working. In today’s white-collar job market, this feels almost impossible, so my future is uncertain. When I was receiving automatic refusal replies on my applications, although I have many years of experience in both big4 and industry, it was hard to see why should I continue with the exams if most probably I will not be able to return on skilled market with my immigration status.

Still, I motivated myself by thinking: One day, I might need this qualification, and at that point, I may not have the time or the focus. It will be much harder in the future, so I told myself not to delay what I could achieve now. Find what motivates you—whether it's a financial goal, a career move, or even just the fear of regret—and let it drive you forward. It doesn't matter how small or big your reason may seem, as long as it works for you. What keeps you up at night deep inside? Sometimes the ""logical"" reason of ""I want a better job"" is not the actual answer.

**5. Disconnect from distractions.** 

This might sound extreme, but if you’re like me and deeply affected by world events, politics, or other distractions, consider deactivating your social media accounts. In February, I deactivated Instagram, Facebook, and X—not just deleting the apps, but fully deactivating my accounts. This created an extra barrier, making it harder to fall back into the emotional and time-draining cycle of scrolling. Just be sure to select ""temporary deactivation"" if you plan to come back later.

I gained so much time, energy, and a better mood. Instead of scrolling, I used my breaks for light, non-dramatic shows like Young Sheldon or went for walks with loud music—Linkin Park, Evanescence, or Nirvana were my go-to stress relievers. These small changes helped me stay focused and emotionally balanced throughout the process.

 **Final Thoughts**

Everyone’s CPA journey is unique. Embrace your path, learn from others, but trust your own methods and BE TRUE WITH YOURSELF. Whether you take seven months, a year or two, whether you juggle multiple responsibilities or focus intensely for a shorter period, your effort and perseverance will lead you to success. Keep pushing forward—you’ve got this!

Thank you to this community for being a source of inspiration and support. 

I would gladly reply to specific questions about my strategies for each exam, what worked, what didn’t, where and which cheat sheets I used etc. Good luck to everyone!

I am a rambler. You might get 4 pages, you might get 40. Roll the dice and find out. 

Some things about me:

• I tend to use a fountain pen when writing. I like blue or black ink with a fine nib. 

• I’m a coffee junkie. I drink about 4 cups (according to the carafe) or two of my mugs a morning. I drink water the rest of the day (so my stupid water app shuts up).

• I have an unreasonable obsession with Mexican food. 

• I tell random side stories. 

Let the writing begin. I’d like to pen the first letter! ",2,1728670574.0,penpals,0,0.75,False

for context, small streetside cafe lang naman ang plano so di pa need ng latte art and such since we’re only planning to use a manual espresso maker

my criteria is:

1. TASTE!
- personally i used to use oatmilk (oatly and oatside) for my coffee dahil lactose intolerant si gurl, BUT since our market is mostly students and common people, buying oatly and oatside will increase the price of our products as well, and mas hasa ang tao sa lasa ng gatas talaga 
- If you can recommend a milk that does not take away the profile of the coffee and is smooth and may pagkacreamy or basta hindi magaspang or lasang kalawang, that would really help

2. Value for money
- can be bought in bulk so mas tipid

3. Low maintenance
- no need to be refrigerated (ekis na agad sa mga milk from farms)

4. Availability 
- As much as possible readily available on shopee or lazada or other online stores.


To be fair, the first few weeks naman we’re willing to experiment with the milk we’ll use, mas okay sakin na i’ll be also hearing from the customers how the milk and coffee tastes, kasi their judgement will be the deciding factor.",1,1728670472.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False

In front of me. He is red but has a normal face and has huge horns very fat and he was looking at me smiling. So as i got up i got really angry and swung at him but he managed to block my punch and started running fast, I started running after him, after about 10 seconds of me cursing at him while running he falls over and starts screaming in this horrible tone. He got up and tried to run but I got to him and started swinging punches to his face left and right till he falls down, then I sat down on his chest and looked in his eyes and he had this incredibly scared look on his face. I started elbowing his face into the ground hard and fast, after about 10 elbows His face was now minced meat and I stood up and started wiping the blood of me with this white shirt I had on and all the sudden the fiery and ugly cave I was in suddenly transforms into this beautiful open field with a forest to the left and this beautiful crystal blue lake to the right and I lied down on the grass breathing extremely heavily from the battle I just won happy and proud of what I done. Then the dream ended and I woke up. I don’t know what this means but it was an incredibly cool dream to have, I wasn’t scared even once I was just full of confidence and rage as I fought the devil. I’m certain it was him, satan. I searched on google what this dream means but couldn’t find anything. Hopefully some of you here can help me figure out what exactly this means.

1g1g8kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/country/comments/1g1g8kw/debut_album_songs_outta_my_head/,"Debut Album - ""Songs Outta My Head""","“Songs Outta My Head” is a collection of 12 songs written about life experienced in Rural America down in the Deep South.  Where life experience is delineated with heartbreak, newfound love, death, moonshine and moonlight.   Where summertime’s sweltering heat in the dog days can leave you begging for forgiveness and laden with journeys that require foot travel for long distances…for your sake and the public’s sake. Where your family can love you to death and drive you crazy.   A life where legends of the past inspire the future.  A life that acknowledges grace is required for us ALL to progress.

My music consists of life experiences….some of those experiences are my own…some are characters based on people in my travels or home community.  Art is about taking our combined lived experiences and sharing them with the world.  I think all of the songs on this album are all stories worth telling and worth your time to hear them.  I hope my music, my art, is a bridge that connects otherwise strange bedfellows and I hope my art is a force for promoting positivity.

What are my music goals?  Make sense from the sounds in my head.  The things I wanna say, the things I have to say, and the things that just come from the ether.  When they overlap, sometimes it’s harmonic, sometimes it's dissonance.  It’s sorting and structuring and expounding and editing and editing and more editing.  Polish the good and compost the rest.  Rinse and repeat.  That is all just my process to write the [song.My](http://song.My) goal is to make my art/my music to my standard.  I don’t think success is defined by views or likes or dollars.  Sure, positive reinforcement is great, but some bird dogs are gonna point, even if nobody is watching or cares.  I’ve been writing songs for well over 20 years and am going to continue regardless if my album has one listen or one billion.  I am not expectant nor reticent, positive or negative.  I know who I am, I am coooooooooooooool with that.

Long story short, I do hope you give my album a listen.  I hope you put it on while drinking coffee, or doing laundry or when meditating.  I hope you crank it up while sunbathing on the beach or put it on your earbuds while mowing the grass.  I hope you blast 'em while having a party with your community.  I hope you enjoy it while watching a magnificent sunset with your loved one.I hope you feel the positivity and good vibrations that music has provided me with over my life experience.  It has been proven repeatedly in my life that music enhances everything.  Good music can be the cherry on top when things are good, it can be a salve when you are broken, and a crutch when you need something to lean on. 

 Most of all, I hope my music makes your life better.

Love Everybody
