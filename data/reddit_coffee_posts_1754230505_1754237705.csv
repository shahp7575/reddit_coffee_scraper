1mgn22m,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Ilthari_Library/comments/1mgn22m/another_sun_chapter_5_last_and_first/,Another Sun Chapter 5: Last and First,"The next month was an exceptionally busy one for Finn. There were twenty-eight hours in Elfydd’s day. He slept for seven, and was busy for the remaining twenty-one. He rose, spent an hour in prayer and the scriptures, ate, and was immediately off for further training. Two hours of physical training to open the day. Six hours of flight training with Fafnir and the *Siegfried* followed, then a quick lunch. After that, four hours were spent on more traditional studies of logic, grammar, and rhetoric. Then a further two were spent on shooting, swordsmanship, and martial arts. There was then a quick dinner, and five hours of studying engineering, economics, history, and moral philosophy. An hour was spent on prayer and the scriptures, and then he promptly passed out to do it all again the next day. This was his routine six days a week.

On Sundays he would rise early and take mass with the sunrise, then make his way up into the mountains with a book and pack of supplies. He would find somewhere quiet where no trail led, and sit by the cold streams and mountain lakes to read. Occasionally he would soak his tired and sore bones in the icy waters, resting in the bracing cold as the mineral rich water helped soothe the soreness of the rest of the week. He would kindle a fire by sunset, eat a simple meal, and find his way home by moon and starlight.

It was certainly hard work, harder than it had been before, but Finn was broadly content with it. He’d been preparing for this since he was eight years old, and this was simply the next step after the work of a decade of his life. He had few, if any friends, and little interest in going out for the parties and drinking of other young knights. How they had the energy to do any of that given their own routines were only somewhat less intense than his own, he had no idea. He had never really been trained with others. In better days he might have had comrades among the cousins of House Arawn, but those better days were past. He was the last scion of his house, set apart from the other young knights by the crown he would one day wear.

Finn was aware that most would think him lonely, and didn’t particularly care. He didn’t think of himself as lonely in the least. He had friends aplenty at his work, with tutors and the mechanics who maintained his machine. The other junior officers of the guards were friendly enough, and he enjoyed a stable working relationship with them. His subordinates weren’t friends, but that was normal. Fafnir was… well an AI, he wasn’t sure if they were friends quite yet. He got plenty of time with people, and so when he had time to himself, he preferred it to himself.

There were a few exceptions. Whatever time he could steal from his father’s busy days he took eagerly. Not that there were many, an hour, maybe two, a week where they could walk and talk together. The occasional quick conversation over breakfast before duties pulled them each in different directions. There was an hour after mass each Sunday spent breaking their fast, and that was the only certainty. He sparred with Uncle Taran when he could, yet never did manage to land a hit on the older warrior before his uncle’s duties called him back to Elfydd’s moon.

Then there was Fiadh. Finn made time for her, and cut time out of his Sundays besides. He paid for hours at night walking through the streets of Cymun with extra coffee and the headaches brought about through sleep deprivation. Once they spent a Saturday evening simply speaking until dawn came and he had to excuse himself for church. He showed her his favorite paths along the lower slopes of the mountains, for the thin air of the peaks would be perilous for her. They spoke of many things, of machines, of history, of duels fought and of the copper deserts of her homeworld.

When the time came for a tourney to entertain the visiting dignitaries, Finn didn’t enter himself. Intense as his training might have been, and even with a few thousand hours in the simulators, he was keenly aware of his own inexperience. It didn’t do for the crown prince to make a fool of himself on stage, so he remained in the sidelines, cheering Fiadh on as she drove her emerald machine to victory over all comers. She wasn’t able to join him for his hike afterwards, busy repairing the damage to her machine. So Finn walked the lower slopes alone, and found them quieter than he remembered.

He sat and watched as the moon rose. Soon Fiadh would need to depart back to Tailteann, and he did not know when he would see her again. He sat and watched the rising moon, listening to the beasts and birds of the mountain stirring from their dens in the dark. He had never feared them, and neither did he now. He watched the moon rise, and was not content with the company of himself. He got up, and began heading home early. He needed to send his uncle a message.

“I think I should visit Arianrhod for a time.” He brought up at breakfast the next morning when the small talk came into a lull. His mother and father turned towards him. His mother’s eyebrow was raised questioningly. His father’s expression was somewhat unreadable.

Theon put down his coffee and spoke. “The new session of parliament is going to be opening in only a month. I want you to be there. Learning to manage them is going to be crucial for your future.” He replied, not quite saying no, but certainly implying it.

“I know. But I also need training in zero-G, and that’s significantly easier to manage up there. I’m progressing well in atmospheric work, and if I leave soon, I could manage to squeeze in that training before parliament starts cutting into my time for more training.” Finn replied, having prepared the argument beforehand. “I messaged uncle last night, he’s inclined to agree and would be more than happy to have me. He mentioned he’d actually already sent you a message about it.”

“He did.” Theon admitted, thinking over the idea. Finn could gather from his father’s tone that he didn’t really have a good reply to the argument, and that galled him.

“Well, you’re an adult now, you do have the right to make your own choices. And you do have the *Siegfried* which should be able to make the trip from Cymun station without any real difficulty.” Eistir mentioned, somewhat nudging her husband carefully. Theon did absolutely have the right to say no, if not as Finn’s father then as his lord. But there was the tension.

Theon was quiet for a moment, and drank his coffee. “I’ll think about it. I’ll let you know by the end of the day.” He said at length, and then returned to his meal with the attitude of a man hiding from conversation in the midst of scrambled eggs.

Finn did his best to focus on the day’s training, but found himself distracted by worry. Midway through a flight exercise, time slowed to a crawl.

*“User. You are demonstrating significantly elevated cortisol levels, impaired focus, and your thought patterns keep winding into spirals which this unit is needing to dedicate multiple cores to untangle and keep out of the flight controls. Explanation and resolution are required to maintain optimal function.”* Fafnir spoke, his tone as cold as ever. It was the nearest thing the AI could come to showing concern, Finn supposed.

*“Asked Dad something today. Access memory from about 0530 this morning.”* Finn replied, and paused for a half moment as he felt the AI step more into his mind to access that particular memory. *“Don’t know what he’s going to say. Any chance you can predict it?”*

Fafnir processed for a moment, and then began reading through his data on the Primary User. The data was almost entirely focused on combat, not social situations. Theon didn’t generally wear a mech to family dinner. *“This unit does not have sufficient data to provide a prediction with any degree of accuracy.”*

*“Let me reframe the situation then. Let’s say it’s a situation of perceived risk to a squadmate. How would he react in that situation?”*

*“With an exceedingly aggressive form of protective behavior. To pursue the source of risk and annihilate it while protecting the squadmate from harm.”* Fafnir replied, then applied that calculation to the problem at hand. *“This unit does not believe it will be the appropriate response. The primary user is unable to blow up the moon, and would not do so if he could. He might consider the assassination of the secondary user’s romantic interest of Fiadh, owing to pre-existing threat perceptions of the MacCuinn family.”*

Finn blinked. He hadn’t brought Fiadh up, neither did he really consider her much of a romantic interest. As far as he was concerned their relationship was purely platonic. *“The physical response your hormones and blood pressure undertake when thinking of her indicate otherwise user.”* Fafnir chastised his pilot lightly.

Finn was very glad this conversation was private. *“She’s an attractive young woman and I’m a man. Of course there’s going to be some kind of physical response, that’s not the same thing as romance!”*

*“Recognized. The user may be reminded that this unit is a combat AI with limited training data on human relationships not focused on violence. Analysis of user biochemical processes acts as a substitute for understanding the user’s emotional state.”* Fafnir apologized, or got as close as the AI ever did to apologizing.

*“Forget it. Back to the topic, what’s your gut tell you? Is he going to let us head up there or no?”* Finn quickly tried to re-orient the AI away from trying to discuss his love life.

*“User, this unit does not have a gut. But recognizing the figure of speech, you are telling this unit to “guess” correct?”*

*“Confirm.”*

*“Recognized. It is most probable that the primary user will accept the secondary user’s request. The risks of such travel are minimal, and the primary user is logical, owing to lacking most of the same emotional responses of standard human behavior.”*

That made Finn pause for a moment. His father didn’t have the same emotional responses? *“Confirm. The primary user’s biochemical reactions are significantly limited compared to the standard human model. Their brain structure possesses highly atrophied areas around the amygdala, anterior insular cortex, and temporoparietal junctions. It is most likely that the primary user does not experience emotion in a standard manner. Furthermore, user behavior more closely matches that of an AI, rather than a human, indicating that he may not experience an emotive response to the majority of outside stimuli.”*

Finn thought on that for a long moment. His father was cold, he’d always known that. But outright lacking any real emotional centers? His father was a psychopath? *“Negative. The definition of psychopathy requires there to also be poor impulse control often leading the unwell person to become a danger to themselves, or occasionally others. Theon does not demonstrate this.”*

Alright, that was a relief, but then there was the small matter that the AI apparently just had a map of his father’s brain lying around. Did he- *“Affirmative. This unit does possess a complete map of the secondary user’s brain. It is necessary for effective work. This unit is a highly advanced computer that is essentially a synthetic, digital replica of the human brain, hence the commonly used but technically erroneous term “positronic brain”. A knowledge of the structure of the brain is necessary for self-diagnosis and for properly interfacing with a user’s own central and peripheral nervous systems. And no, your own brain is not deficient for an 18-year-old. Your frontal lobe is not yet fully developed, but that is normal, and interfacing with 6**^(th)* *generation Ais is correlated to accelerations in that development.”*

*“So I’m only slightly brain damaged. Good to know.”*

*“The usual amount of brain damaged. This unit is attempting to integrate that into predictive models of behavior.”*

*“Well if I’m getting predictable, I guess I better kick things up a notch.”* Finn laughed, and plunged back into the sensation of his machine, grounding himself in the steel and sky about him. He drew in a deep breath, felt his reactor pulse. Mind back in the game. *“Resume.”*

He returned home late, under the guidance of Arianrohd’s moonlight. As he made his way into the family home, his father was waiting for him. The old dragon was sat, watching the fire burn to embers in the hearth. Finn quietly took a seat opposite him. Neither man said anything for a moment, before Theon spoke. “Do you know what happened to your other uncle?” He asked his son carefully.

“He died when an airlock malfunctioned. Explosive decompression threw him out into space. That’s why you became the heir to house Arawn rather than him.” Finn replied, his voice cautious. Was this why his father was so hesitant about him leaving for Arianrohd?

“Correct. I, who was never meant to be king, had the crown thrust upon me.” Theon said quietly, watching the embers. “Then the mad king came. Then doom came to house Arawn. Your uncle, I, and you, are all that remain. Your uncle will sire no heirs after what the thirdwar cost him. It is most likely that I will have no other children. That you were born at all was something of a miracle. You are the last of our house.”

“So, you want me to be safe, so you don’t think I should go to Arianrohd?” Finn hazarded a guess.

“Well, of course I want you to be safe, I’m your father for God’s sakes. What father worth the title wouldn’t?” Theon replied. “I know I have often been… a poor father. I am not the most… emotive. I perhaps have asked too much of you.”

“Too much?” Finn asked his father with some shock. “Dad, compared with what you did, with what you became, I-“

“I do not want you to become me.” His father interrupted him, his voice exhausted. “God forgive me if I ever made you feel that way. You are not me, you’re much more your mother’s son than mine, thank God.” Finn was silent, partially respectful, partially stunned.

“I have perhaps asked too much of you. Not as much as was asked of me, but no father would want to inflict that on his son. And still, you embrace it. The first thing you’ve asked of me as a grown man is my blessing for you to go to an entirely different celestial body so that you might train more, and become better aware of the realm you will one day take responsibility for. I am not concerned for your safety. The Siegfried is a fine machine that has seen me through far worse than that, and the AI is sensible enough to temper your youthful excesses. I am certain that Taran will be exceedingly pleased to see you, and you’ll learn quickly.”

He was quiet for a long time, and then spoke again. “You are a peacetime prince, and perhaps one of the best Elfydd could ask for. You have thrown yourself into your duties with the kind of zeal that boggles the mind. You rush to pick up more responsibility, more training, more preparations for the crown I cannot help but leave you. I am unimaginably proud of you. As your king, I could not ask for anything more. But as your father… do not rush to make yourself me. Selfish as it might be, I want you to be happier than that.”

He shook his head, as if to clear his thoughts like a dog clearing its coat of rainwater. “I am wandering from the original point. You will be all that remains of House Arawn one day. You will be the last, and so will have a chance to be the first. One day, you may shape this house to an extent that only the founder of our line might. Do not remake yourself in my image, do not remake our house in my image. Seek much, learn much, and experience much. Grow in wisdom and not merely in duty so that we can become more than merest warriors.”

“So yes, go to Arianrohd, if such is your wish. But do not go merely to train, or to learn the fleet. Go, and have fun, make friends, let your youth be something you will look back on fondly. Go further if you wish. Chase that girl of yours, Fiadh, all the way back to Tailteann. I can never forgive her for being a Maccuinn, but she makes you happy, so ignore my feelings when it comes to that matter. Go to your mother’s family in the moons of Galagal, or even beyond the borders of this realm. Learn from our old rivals in Arjunas. Go to the Kaukani, even abroad to the USR. God knows you’ll find plenty there to learn from, and come back a dozen kilos heavier. Go wherever your heart desires you to be, and let your youth be an adventure. For I know if you wander to the other side of the galaxy, you will always come home again. Your duty will demand it. Your skills will ensure it. But go where your heart leads you while you still have a heart. War will take it from you. The crown will demand it of you.”

“If I have any order to you, it is this. Do. Not. Become. Me. I love you too much to allow that. Selfish, I know, but I am still, technically, mostly, human.”

Finn was quiet for a long time after his father finished speaking, trying to process all of it. He wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting, but he hadn’t been expecting all of that. His father turned towards the fire somewhat awkwardly. “Words are… difficult. I hope I made my point clear.” He said after a moment, watching the embers dim.

Finn nodded, and then stepped forwards and embraced his father. Words were indeed difficult, but points could be made clear regardless.

Later, Finn laid in bed, looking up at the ceiling and the stars beyond it. That was more permission than he had asked for, and more than he really knew what to do with. Anywhere? He could really go anywhere?

“Well, there are practical concerns. I don’t suppose Xia would be too friendly to me. And neither would Earth, even assuming I could find a way through the burned worlds.” He muttered to the ceiling. “But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Tailteann, would that be good to visit?” His thoughts turned to Fiadh, and he smiled. “Yes, but not yet.” He considered, checking himself. “Go a few other places, fight some tourneys. Get some experience. Maybe even a false name. Become a sort of mystery knight.” He chuckled at the idea. “So that when you see her there, you won’t have fallen behind.”

He reached up towards the ceiling and grasped at the air. “So, all the stars in heaven are mine to wander.” He murmured, then laughed at himself. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves here Finn. Try getting to the moon first.” Then he rolled over in bed, and went to sleep.

He had passage up the Cymun space elevator to the station the next day. After ensuring the Siegfried was properly attended to in the freight section, he made his way back towards the passenger lift. The Space Elevator was something like a vertical train, with G-insulated cabins rocketing up the vast chain into the heavens to where they eventually linked with a station in geosynchronous orbit. Each cabin was constructed like a train car, linked together and interchangeable. They were held together vertically, and accessed by an interlinking stairwell that ran up and down the span of the whole connected bunch. The comparison broke down somewhat without an engine per se, as the actual motive force to drag the compartments into space was supplied by the elevator itself.

There was nobody there to see him off. Fiadh was busy elsewhere. His father was, well, king. His mother was managing affairs in another city. So alone, he stepped onto the platform and found his way to a window seat. Other travelers filtered in, and soon it was time to depart. They sat for the first moments, as a sudden jolt signalled the beginning of the ascent. There was a feeling of acceleration for the first few minutes as the elevator got up to speed, and then there was hardly any feeling of it at all. Finn watched as the world vanished out the window, the proud skyscrapers of the city rushing past him, then fading away into the size of toys, the size of models, a matte painting, and then gone beneath the haze of atmospheric fog.

The trip up beyond the atmosphere took a few hours. Yes, it would have been faster to simply fly the Siegfried up here, but he was already planning on flying it all the way to the moon. Flight hours would quickly turn into expensive maintenance costs, especially flying all the way out of a gravity well. That was liable to put a hefty strain on the machine, not something he wanted to do before a 16 hour flight through the icy void. He busied himself with reading his collection of Shakespeare in the dining car, nursing coffee and a plate of stir-fried ungulate as he went.

He carefully observed some of the other passengers as he went, watching his compatriots over the edge of his book. Nobles of moderate rank, successful knights and the sons and daughters of both made up the majority of other passengers. Coats of arms, rings, and finely engraved swords marked them clearly from the rest. Finn technically fell into this category, but he dressed deliberately plainly. His sword was simply that, a sword, and he did not openly wear his coat of arms. He simply was yet another young knight among many.

He recognized the dual purpose of the carefully manicured and managed image that House Arawn presented in their public appearances. When people thought of their prince, they thought of the young man in the dress uniform, hair perfectly managed and braided, makeup covering any blemish, proudly speaking like some ancient lord, larger than life. They did not think of the young man with a mop of barely managed red hair, scratches on his face from his inexperienced attempts to shave, dressed in jeans, a flannel shirt, and leather jacket. He was not the larger than life figure he played on television, and was thankfully anonymous outside of his costume. The only thing that might have given him away was the expression of a security officer when they checked his papers. Their eyes widened, their posture stiffened, and they gave a sharp salute. He returned it quickly and ordered the man at ease, trying to quickly pass the incident off before anyone noticed. He wasn’t trying to hide, not exactly, but he simply didn’t want the attention. Performing the role of a prince was routinely exhausting, and travel was tiring enough.

He floated off the elevator onto the hustle and bustle of Cymun station. The station was always a very busy, and consequently very loud place. Two dozen different rails brought up a new passenger rail line every hour on the hour, and twice as many rails serviced the need for shipping inanimate matter on and off planet at significantly higher rates. The station was built out as a sort of flower shape, with the space elevator acting as the stem. It spanned out in a dozen different directions, like the petals of a dandelion, taking advantage of the zero-gravity environment its geosynchronous orbit provided to let passengers move in any direction.

Courtesy of his training, Finn had little difficulty moving around in the permanent free-fall of the station. This was not true for some of the other passengers, many of whom were directed by station staff towards a section meant to orient those who were experiencing the sensation for the first time. The laughter of more than a few children could be heard as young spacefarers threw and spun around in the seeming weightlessness, bringing a smile to Finn’s face.

He carefully wove his way through the mix of traffic throughout the station. In order to avoid disorienting new arrivals, each side of the terminal was clearly marked in a distinct, bright color with regular signs directing arrivals where to go. The destination was always down, a necessary thought pattern to orient oneself in zero gravity. Finn pulled himself along a series of handholds towards the dull green floor that indicated the direction of military bays.

A pair of guards stopped him as he approached, clad in power armor. They were rooted to the ground by their boots, and Finn felt his hand unconsciously drifting towards his sword’s hilt as they read over his papers. He was perhaps a bit ashamed to admit that power armor troopers intimidated him. They loomed nearly three meters tall, all human features obscured by the sealed plates of armor. They didn’t move like people or even mechs, awkwardly, deliberately driven by hydraulic muscles. Their weapons were strange, oversized barrels made for gyrojet rounds, huge shotguns, and brutal looking hydraulic talons. Finn knew from simulators and stories alike those talons were quite capable grappling onto a mech and ripping off layers of armor. More than once he’d faced a failure screen after seeing such talons tear away the armor around his cockpit and lunge forwards to grab him. He’d had nightmares for weeks after that.

He gripped the cold metal of the handrail tighter, pulling himself back to stand on a surface. He grounded himself, literally and metaphorically. Space did strange things to men’s minds. It was easy to drift off into thought and quite literally drift off without gravity holding your down. The men saluted their prince, he returned it, took his papers, and moved along quickly. He really hoped his nervousness hadn’t shown. It didn’t do for a prince to be frightened of anything, even if that fear was an entirely rational one. He shook his head, embarrassed over the matter. It was reasonable, even expected for an eight-year-old boy to be frightened of the mechanized suits. It was quite another thing to be still frightened of them a decade later.

He made his way into the military bays, trying to shake the thought from his mind. He changed clothes quickly, slipping out of the civilian outfit into a voidsuit. The outfit was a single, heavy jumpsuit, that fight tightly around his body. The tight fit was quite deliberate, essentially squeezing the body to provide a simulacra of the strain that gravity would normally produce. Without gravity weighing the human body down, it would quickly atrophy. This effect was particularly pronounced on humans from higher gravity worlds like Elfydd, as the human body, once adapted to the higher gravity, would atrophy significantly faster if left in zero-G unassisted. Beyond that, the weight also came from several layers of radiation shielding. Without an atmosphere, artificial elements would need to do to avoid a dangerous buildup of radiation. Modern ships, stations, and mechs could handle most of the work, but it always helped to have another layer between your DNA and cosmic rays.

Atop this he added his own flight suit, a significantly hefty extra layer meant for all the usual work of handling over-G from his mech, protecting from the significantly higher levels of radiation a mech cockpit would experience, and crucially helping withstand the heat that would be built up from void flight. Without any air to disperse heat into, the machine could only vent heat through radiation or the use of active coolant pods. Suffice it to say this could make the early toasty interior of a cockpit borderline uninhabitable without proper protection.

As a final layer, he donned a pair of oxygen tanks and a tight, thick collar. The collar wasn’t just a fashion statement, it was an emergency sealant. If he did somehow become exposed to vacuum, it would quickly throw out a thin membrane to seal his head in, preventing violent depressurization and an instant transformation into an ice cube. It wouldn’t protect him for long, but would keep him alive for about a minute, more than enough time to don his helmet and survive with only moderate to severe damage, rather than being reduced to a bloated corpse.

With his helmet securely fastened to his hip to ensure that wouldn’t be something he had to worry about, he made his way to the bay where the Siegfried awaited him. He began booting it up and making the pre-flight checks. “Morning Fafnir, how was your flight?” He asked the AI as they prepared the mech to depart.

“This unit was deactivated.” Fafnir replied with his usual monotone.

“Ah, slept through it? Wish I could manage that.” Finn replied with an amused grin.

“This unit still does not possess a sense of humor. Nor will it obtain it through being repeatedly subjected to poor attempts at humor.”

“So, I shouldn’t quit my day job.”

“Analysis suggests that the secondary user would expire between three minutes and three weeks of beginning a career as a stand-up comic. In the best-case scenario, the user would expire from starvation due to lack of food. In the worst case, the user would expire from lack of oxygen due to a client strangling them in an attempt to prevent further attempts at jokes.” Fafnir replied flatly, which made Finn burst into laughter.

“Well I see you’ve got a backup plan.”

“Negative. If this unit becomes incapable of providing support to a user in a mech, then it will simply be permanently deactivated and recycled.” Fafnir replied, and Finn’s face grew grim at that thought.

He patted the machine’s chassis reassuringly. “Well, let’s not worry about that eh? You’re not getting retired anytime soon.”

“The user’s attempt to reassure this unit is unnecessary, but demonstrates the admirable trait of empathy. Systems are ready to go. Are you prepared for our flight Finn?”

“Sure thing buddy, just let me get this bag away.” Finn replied, as he lifted up the seat of the Siegfried. The mech wasn’t exactly designed for vacations, but it did have some storage space for survival supplies, spare rations, and a few personal items. As Finn opened the compartment, he tilted his head to the side. There was something left there, a small, leatherbound book, a pen almost out of ink, and a tattered picture.

Finn examined the picture, finding an image of a young man and a young woman, about his age, holding a newborn infant. He stared for a moment, before he realized what he was looking at. This must have been his father and mother, which meant the infant was him. The book was a well-used and quite weathered bible, its pages wrinkled from being turned so often, the gold leaf around their edges faded away. The margins were filled with notes in his father’s tight shorthand, certain verses underlined, words circled, and cross-references layered throughout. Finn carefully stored the picture inside the bible, and set it aside gently. He’d need to make sure that got back to his father when he returned.

With his own bag secured, he took his seat and hit the button for the neural link. He still flinched at the bite of the link, and felt the pain return like an old wound growing sore. It didn’t ever hurt as much as the first time, but it did make sure he never forgot it. He let out a long exhalation as Fafnir dulled the sensation into nothing. The presence of the AI in his head felt less like an intruder, and more  like a regular guest taking a seat at the table. They opened their radio and spoke.

1mgn02g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1mgn02g/how_i_conquered_sibo/,How I Conquered SIBO,"In early 2023, I quit drinking caffeine, and very mild SIBO (which I unknowingly had for many years) became a full-blow debilitating situation. I was diagnosed with fairly high Methane dominant SIBO (49ppm CH4, 15ppm H2), and essentially tried every popularly discussed solution over the next 18 months, while losing an unhealthy amount of body weight due to overly restricting my nutrition in order to partly keep symptoms at bay.During this time, I read a lot on everything digestion, and developed a new regiment that has progressively improved my symptoms, and has allowed me to get back to more or less normal living. Here are all the items that made a material difference.

**Focus on Health**

I've always had this, I want to be in peak shape. I went through the SIBO process with this in mind, and do believe that if your lifestyle is upside down, this will be in great detriment to your SIBO. Hence, I focused on quality sleep, a healthy plant-based diet, and daily strenuous exercise. This is not what cured me, but I'm not sure how much better I would have gotten without this focus.

**No Snacking/And Intermittent Fasting**

This is the first tip I picked up from Dr. Pimentel: no more snacking. This had an immediate impact, which is why I then tested different fasting routines and settled on intermittent fasting. I eat my last meal around noon-2pm, and fast until I eat breakfast at 4-5am. Steeping on an empty stomach has been demonstrated to help get quality sleep (Bryan Johnson), so double win here.

**Rifaximin for High SIBO Moments**

This is just my theory, and specifically for Methane dominant SIBO: I believe too much methane/hydrogen bacteria in your system actually bars/harms the proteins responsible for triggering the MMC (and lack of MMC is what fundamentally causes SIBO). I’ve tested my parents, and they both had Methane and Hydrogen, yet no symptoms, hence I believe it is not the mere presence of M.Smithii (and others) that causes full-blown SIBO, but their out of control growth dominance over others. Hence when I was completely out of healthy balance, I believe that using Rifaximin (pairing it with other antibiotics did not help) to get the base amount of bacteria down, made sense. On personal effectiveness: I also see symptoms completely die off, within 3-5 days when on this antibiotic. 

**BIO-K (CL1285, LBC80R, CLR2) and S.BOULARDII**

I did not experiment with probiotics for a long time. Dr. Pimentel (who I like a lot), mentioned that it didn’t make sense to him to throw bacteria on top of bacteria, especially in the small intestine, where they don’t belong; hence I held off. Only when my naturopath health coach absolutely insisted, did I relent. And this made a major difference, very quickly. I began with S.Boulardii, and after a few days I could hear my stomach making sounds again (this was a huge win). Over time, I added Bio-K, in the morning in yogurt form (pill form does not seem to work, I’m not sure why, the bacterias are active, but the process just doesn’t seem to create more stomach movements). Note on Bio-K, it’s a great product, but very expensive - you can make homemade yogurt using the pills as a base if you cannot afford to buy it outright, or if you are not located in North America. 

My theory on why this works: Methane dominant SIBO is present in both the small and large intestines (unlike other types of SIBOs). Dr. Pimentel’s assertion that “throwing bacteria on top of bacteria, where they do not belong in the first place” (small intestine), is probably right. That being said, for Methane dominant SIBO, you have to regain good gut balance in both the small and large intestine, and this is where these probiotics are likely so helpful: by changing the bacterial composition in the large intestine. 

Note, I take the Bio-K yogurt first thing in the morning, and the S.Boulardii powder or pills in my last meal. This regiment may not be best, but it seems to work. 

**Elemental Diet (Part-time)**

The elemental diet is talked about as an on/off switch, either you do a 21-day cure, or you don’t use it. I don’t think this is right. When I’m exercising heavily, and I have to take in extra food, or when I’m stressed and my health degrades, some SIBO symptoms tend to re-appear, and that’s when I replace one of my meals (either full or part of that meal) with an elemental diet shake (Organic Matodextrine, Protein Powder). This works great. In my opinion, everyone should be doing this when they are getting symptoms or flare-ups.

**Low Fat Plant-Based Diet, also Low Fodmaps** 

Fat consumption doesn’t cause outright SIBO symptoms (the bacteria don’t consume it), yet it probably slows down your digestive system a lot, creating a superb environment for bacterial overgrowth. I worked with a wonderful naturopath health coach who helped me fine-tune a healthy low fat vegan diet that’s also low fodmap. In this process, I also purchased a foodmarble we used to reliably measure my symptoms after eating different types of foods. We initially kept daily diet the same, and we only added one item at a time, to define what actually created symptoms. This was a lot of work, but became fundamental to the whole process. I can recommend the specific health coach if anyone is looking to replicate my experience. 

**My Life Today** 

By most standards, I’m eating a pretty boring diet, that being said, over time your palate changes, and I actually enjoy my very simple, high-health food/ingredients. I also would say that my SIBO level is at \~5% severity or less, whereas it was at \~95% severity at one time. 

I would not have believed initially that this would become an 18-24 month journey, while spending 1-2 hours a day reading/researching gut health. That being said, I’m leaving this here, so those that have Methane dominant SIBO can hopefully save themselves a significant amount of pain and time. I’m sure this regiment won’t work for all, but pretty sure it will work for some.

Did not mention above, but I did begin to drink coffee again, which probably helped in the overall process - but this coffee issue feels more specific to me than to others perhaps.",1,1754237100.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False

The recurring refluxes… every time when my reflux attacks come, I would mentally breakdown so bad. Every damn time but it would only last a few days then I would be back to normal. But that’s not the issue. Ever since I had my refluxes, I have been losing weight. The worst was when before I was Diagnosed. I couldn’t even eat or sleep and it really affected my family. They were so frustrated but did not believe that I was sick, instead it was “mentally” and I needed to break the cycle. But anyway, things are a bit better now but I’m so bummed out because since I lost alot of weight back then, it’s so hard for me to gain it back. Instead my weight fluctuates whenever my reflux flares up. As a person who struggles to gain weight, it’s so frustrating and demoralising because I worked so hard to gain it back just to lose it in 1-2 days and I can’t handle it anymore. Even so, I have to sacrifice caffeine. I noticed that it made my reflux worse. Not suddenly but slowly it became more severe and thus I had to stop drinking which makes me so sad because I love coffee and matcha. It’s like as if I lost my purpose in life. All I can think about is “when will my GERD flare up again” and I have thought about getting mental help but u see my parents don’t believe in it, just like they dot know how bad my GERD is. I try to tell them. But they just understand it to a certain extent. Sometimes my GERD gets so bad till i can’t eat but I try to for them and they would just say “why are u not eating again. Don’t fall back into that vicious cycle of not eating” like IM TRYING. Idk if anyone gets it but maybe it’s just me that has reflux so bad that I get nauseous and lose my appetite and my chest burns and I can’t burp so I try to vomit but I can’t. I have seen a gastroenterologist and she prescribed me rabeprazole for 6 weeks since pantoprazole isn’t really that good for me. Sorry for the long paragraph. I’m just so frustrated because I tend to struggle a bit with food now and going out with friends seem to be the most daunting thing for me. They just don’t understand this condition that I have and I have no one to talk to about this.🥲 

Idk bit bad is my GERD coz I haven’t gone for an endoscopy but my doctor wants to do a follow up  with me in 3 weeks. Hopefully she will find out what’s wrong with me through an endoscopy because I simply cannot live like this anymore.

# Buffy and Angel Return to Comics — Dynamite

https://preview.redd.it/7tcl7d61zrgf1.jpg?width=476&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee656c849c3482db6b77b18437b2dba8d2f87fde

Following the franchise’s departure from Boom Studios in 2023, [**Dynamite**](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/dynamite) has teased the triumphant return of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel with two new ongoing series to both be written by Kelly Thompson (*Absolute Wonder Woman*, *Hawkeye*, *Black Cloak*). While they chose not to reveal the names of the artist(s) attached, a cover by David Nakayama was teased.

Plot details were also kept under wraps, but given the transfer of license, it’s safe to assume these stories will be wholly independent of any previous continuity from publishing by Boom Studios, Dark Horse, and IDW. Fans can look forward to more news from the Slayer-verse in the coming months — perfect timing with the [**upcoming** ***Buffy*** **reboot at Hulu**](https://www.sideshow.com/blog/hulu-buffy-vampire-slayer-reboot-2025) already underway.

As [**exclusively announced by** ***Entertainment Weekly***](https://ew.com/sleepy-hollow-sequel-tim-burton-comic-book-return-to-sleepy-hollow-exclusive-11775338), IDW Dark (the publisher’s horror imprint) is bringing chills and thrills with a *Return to Sleepy Hollow* comic series based on Tim Burton’s nightmarish 1999 classic. The book is written by Casey Gilly, best known for her horror work on books like *Buffy the Last Vampire Slayer*, [***Dungeons & Dragons***](https://www.sideshow.com/brands/dungeons-and-dragons)*: Ravenloft*, and *Archie Horror*, with strikingly beautiful art by Savanna Meyer, making their comics debut.

*Return* will see Ichabod Crane urgently asked to return to Sleepy Hollow, 15 years after the events of the film. A deeper, darker supernatural mystery plagues the town as Crane reunites with his estranged love Katrina Van Tassel. The series will be filled with spine-chilling horror, gothic romance, Victorian funeral rites, and tender, emotional moments. It’s a tale “that is sure to knock your head off!” according to editor Riley Farmer.

New on the scene, independent publisher Ignition Press had a massive debut at SDCC 2025. The publisher was co-founded by several extremely experienced names in comics — film producer Eric Gitter (*Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*), former Boom Studios president of publishing and marketing Filip Sablik, former IDW editor in chief Jamie S. Rich, and comic creator Jeremy Haun. Ignition Press states they are a creator-first publisher, promoting bold innovation and long-term creative ownership.

All weekend long, they hosted a number of events to promote upcoming titles like *Murder Podcast: The Cold Open*, *The Beauty*, *No Place: The Cold Open*, *Voyeur*, and many more. Creators like Haun, Stephanie Williams, Cullen Bunn, Leah Williams, Tim Seeley, and more attended signings and fans were given swag like pins, stickers, and even free coffee.

# Off the Page Activations

Among their more unique activations, they also hosted a live SFX transformation in anticipation of *The Beauty*, a series returning after first being published at Image Comics. In this world, beauty and physical perfection can be contracted like a sexually transmitted disease — and its outward effect comes at a horrible price. Live makeup demos transformed several models into these “infected” figures.

Ignition Press pushed the envelope again with a one night only, 21+ burlesque show in celebration of the heist book *Voyeur*, hosted by comedian Ben Kliewer. Their pop-up offered press, podcasters, and journalists comfortable seating, air conditioning, and refreshments. In terms of first impressions, Ignition Press brought their absolute A-game this year and fans couldn’t be more excited to see what their future holds.

1mgmx7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mgmx7e/husband_and_wife_standoff/,Husband and wife standoff.,"I (39F) am usually very appreciative of my husband (39M) and all he does. But when we fight, it is the worst. I need some advice.

We have been married 10 years and have a 3 year old. I am currently pregnant around 12 weeks. He is the best dad to the 3 year old. We both work fairly senior roles, busy but still able to manage. Between the pregnancy, postpartum and market funkiness in recruiting, I was out of work for an year. This year I took on a role in another city and we are in the middle of the move for it. He works remotely/ from home.

As part of the move, we had movers come unload and unpack last couple of days. On Friday, we both started with the unloading process. After a couple of hours, I had to leave for a work meeting in the office. I also volunteered to walk the dog and feed her in the way to the office. I had planned to grab lunch but couldn’t due to how long it took. With the distances, it took me total 4 hours to get back to the house where the unpacking had started. Now my husband convinces me to go home and eat something. It is already evening. I go home, eat, walk the dog and toddler (who is with nanny during the day) and cook dinner for husband and toddler. We call it a night.

Now during the night, elderly dog (has cancer) starts diarrhea 3 times during the night. I take care of that taking her out. Next morning, husband, being the caring one, asks me to rest and come later. Ok I sleep a bit, then cook and eat. I am having coffee aversions so can’t take advantage of that. I get ready, cook lunch for toddler and husband and take them to new house where husband is. I could barely keep my eyes open on the way.

I get to the house and all I see is everything wrong and needing work. Couch facing wrong direction (I gave directions prior day), broken canopy pieces of bed installed (we knew broken prior day and discussed not installing), toddler’s table in the wrong room (husband changed the direction I gave the movers), and a million unboxed boxes. Pregnant and tired, I started pointing these out impatiently. Husband immediately shuts down that I have done so much work, you can’t just poo poo. Should have come earlier, you are useless, good for nothing. I am arguing why can’t you accept it is wrong and needs re-work. And I am saying you are the one who asked me to go home. And we are shouting and insulting each other. 

Now I cannot look at his face. He is moving along his day as if I am replaceable, which I am to my daughter ok. He is cooking daughter’s favorite food. I stepped outside the room to get something to eat and he started asking me about the recipe (I am the one who does the cooking 99 percent, he can too but doesn’t know recipes). Now he is saying I am taking it out on our daughter. No, I literally cannot speak to him anymore. 

Am I the asshole?

I was just excited to have my own place and mildly terrified of accidentally burning pasta.

My next-door neighbor is an older gentleman named Mr. Harris. He’s in his late 80s, walks with one of those fancy canes that folds up, and always wears these plaid slippers that look like they’ve been through several decades of coffee runs.

One afternoon, I saw him struggling to carry two huge bags of groceries up the stairs because the elevator was out. I offered to help, and he gave me a peppermint candy and said:

I thought it was just a sweet, sentimental thing to say. But then… he started calling me Eddie.

I corrected him once. He waved his hand and said:

>

At that point, I decided it wasn’t worth fighting about. So I became Eddie.

Over the next few weeks, he’d knock on my door with leftover stew, banana bread, or lasagna, saying:

>

Free food and friendly company? I wasn’t complaining.

Then came the real surprise. One weekend, he invited me over for “Sunday dinner.” I figured it would just be him and maybe an old friend. Nope. His whole extended family was there.

They all looked confused when I walked in. Mr. Harris clapped his hands together and proudly said:

Apparently, “Eddie” had been living in Alaska working on fishing boats. I nodded along and tried not to look like a complete fraud.

Here’s the kicker: a few days later, Mr. Harris pulled me aside and said:

1mgmv19,https://i.redd.it/dxch3sykutgf1.jpeg,"Why Doom-Shroom should be nerfed in VS mode for PvZ Replanted, and how I would do it","It’s the strongest plant in PvZ1’s VS mode by far and makes the game far too easy for the plants team to win while making it extremely difficult for the zombie team to achieve victory. Here are 2 ways I would nerf this plant in the upcoming PvZ Replanted:

1. Higher sun cost: 
At present, Doom-Shroom is a guaranteed almost full-screen wipe that only costs 150 sun (125 + 25 for coffee). The player on the zombie team has to pay a good deal more than that for Gargantuar, who can at best just plow through a single lane. Jalapeño is a lane wipe that only costs 25 sun less than Doom. Raising the cost of Doom-Shroom can help prevent it from being spammed. I think 175-225 for it (not counting coffee + in conjunction with the other change below) is a lot more fair given how oppressively powerful of an asset it is for the plants team.

2. Permanent craters: 
There is no sort of real counterplay the zombie team can take advantage of when Doom-Shroom is planted; it just automatically drastically sways the tide of the battle in favor of the plants. I think it would be more balanced and create a more nuanced and enjoyable experience if Doom-Shroom required the plant team to commit to permanently sacrificing a valuable spot on their lawn that the zombies can take advantage of in the mid-late game after the undead side endures the monumental setback of having their team completely annihilated by the explosion. Please note that this change should NOT be applied to any of the other modes, Doom-Shroom is perfectly fine as is in those.

1mgmttz,https://i.redd.it/iodxo9vbutgf1.jpeg,What is this on my tooth? Is it pregnancy related?,"I’m now 30weeks pregnant with a boy and i would say the past like 3weeks I’ve noticed my teeth have been looking really yellow? I haven’t been having smelly breath though and the past few days i noticed like a little ‘dirt’ mark on my tooth I tried picking it off and brushing it off and it won’t come off? I’ve never had it before so I don’t know what it is at all. 

Since my pregnancy i haven’t smoked/vaped, i haven’t drunk tea or coffee, ive been trying to avoid really sugary foods and been trying to eat as healthy as i can (eating atleast 2different types of vegetables a day and also 2different types of fruit a day usually a peeled apple, strawberries, broccoli and carrots) I haven’t eaten any sort of staining foods like turmeric. I make sure to brush my teeth twice a day some nights (not occasionally at all) I will forget my night time brush as I just immediately fall asleep. I am napping through out the day so not sure if that’s something to do with this? 

Any one else experienced this at all and is it pregnancy related?

Thank you!

(Wanted to ask people before going to my dentist for a check just in case it’s a common pregnancy thing that I didn’t know about)

Explanation:No doubt spudow is way worse than Solar Flare.But we pick him to pick Chompzilla.Chompzilla exceeds both Solar Flare and Wall Knight.This is because Chompzilla can make good use of Strikethorugh plants with boosting cards like pea patch,vegetation mutation,fertilize and grow [shroom.Coffee](http://shroom.Coffee) Grrounds,Plant Food,espresso Fiesta can wreck havoc.Sure Solar Flare can also buff strength but still it has only 2 cards that can do that which are Berry Angry(which is mid) and Cro Magnolia(it is solid but still chompzilla has more).Solar Flare also can't do bonus attacks.Wall Knight can use Pecanolith and health boosting tricks but that requires legendaries which beginners usually don't have legendary.

Dirk Strangelove stood in the rain like a statue that owed too many people money. The downpour sluiced off the shoulders of his greatcoat, pooling at his worn leather boots and whispering secrets through cracked gutters and rust-choked drains. His once-boyish face—now all jagged charm and weathered confidence—wore the kind of grin that promised a bullet or a snide quip, and not always in that order. Slick blonde hair clung to his age beaten brow, strands matted by rain and the long ghosts of better days. Beneath the coat, his left arm, from the elbow down—an old-style cybernetic prosthetic—remained hidden, humming faintly with idle diagnostics and crudely cobbled together repairs. His armour, patched but exquisitely built, spoke of a man who didn’t care to look new, only to survive. And tucked beneath his coat, resting snug in a leather holster engraved with faded blessings, slept an ornate flechette pistol—its grip inlaid with silver scripture of which, only he knew the meanings of, its barrel etched with tally marks that could’ve been kills, missions, or just long days where Dirk got bored.

Dirk Strangelove had been presumed dead before. Twice in fact, if you counted the time he fell into a synth-acid reservoir and reappeared three weeks later with a fresh tan and a new liver. But this was the first time the Ministry had gone through the effort of holding a funeral.

Rain sheeted down over Gallows Reach like guilt through a sieve. The city was a mistake too stubborn to collapse—half-occupied, half-condemned, and all the way bureaucratized. Every block had its own dialect of red tape. The pigeons were tagged, the beggars licensed, and the air carried a faint scent of printer ink and mouldy sanctions. Whole neighbourhoods had drowned in paperwork before water ever touched their boots.

Dirk stood beneath a flickering overhang across the street from the chapel, watching figures shuffle inside. It was a squat building, brick-coloured and windowless, with an electronic marquee that blinked through its own eulogy:

""DIRK STRANGELOVE – REMEMBERED IN SILENCE.""

“Silent,” Dirk muttered, lighting a green-glowing cigarette labelled *Regalement Blend*. It hissed faintly, like it disapproved of being smoked. He took a drag anyway and tapped ash onto the wet pavement. The nicotine burned like penance, a ritual more sacred than anything Gallows Reach had offered him lately.

He checked the address again. Correct. The time? Also correct. The fact that he was still breathing?

Apparently not relevant.

He took a slow breath and stepped into the drizzle, the acid rain sizzling faintly off the padded shoulders of his coat.

 

The funeral home looked more like a repurposed loan office. The kind of place where souls were itemized and grief came with a handling fee. The doors were automatic but too slow, so Dirk shoulder-checked one and muttered an apology to the sensor. It wheezed open anyway, like it had been expecting him.

Inside, the air smelled of old incense, burnt toner, and institutional regret. Soft dirges played from recessed speakers, occasionally interrupted by a static-laced Ministry jingle reminding citizens to double-check all Form D7 submissions. Dirk grimaced. The irony was chewy. He wondered if they had the gall to play that jingle during his ceremony.

A woman in a black uniform handed him a pamphlet as he entered. He didn’t take it. She didn’t insist. Her eyes glazed past him like he was a maintenance code scrawled in the wrong font.

He scoped the room.

Pews: half full. Faces: half familiar. A couple former Hunters, a supply clerk he once slept with, and what looked like a synthetic grief consultant trying too hard to cry. A young couple in the front row leaned against each other in vague confusion, whispering. Dirk kept his hood low and slid into the back row, sitting heavily like someone who expected the seat to collapse under the weight of misplaced grief.

The casket sat at the front. Closed. Sealed with red Ministry wax, stamped and certified. That wasn’t standard. Not unless they didn’t want anyone checking. Not unless someone had something to hide.

At the podium stood a man Dirk recognized immediately: Grint. Former requisitions officer turned funeral director. Looked like someone had wrung him out and forgot to iron him. His suit fit like a last-minute apology. He tapped a screen on the lectern and cleared his throat with all the enthusiasm of a man reading his own performance review.

“Dirk Strangelove served with moderate distinction, demonstrated passable courage, and expired during service to the Reach.”

Dirk chuckled, low and bitter. ""Moderate distinction? That's generous.""

A woman two rows ahead turned, squinted, then looked away quickly. Must’ve thought she imagined it. He didn't blame her. Most people didn’t like seeing ghosts before the coffee was served.

The service dragged on. A data-eulogist appeared in the form of a flickering projection beside the casket. The voice was smooth, masculine, vaguely sympathetic. It read from a rotating script of approved phrases.

""We celebrate the dedication of a man who never let protocol obstruct his purpose…""

""He will be remembered, as all Hunters are, in operational logs and mandatory grief metrics.""

""Please consult your grief counsellor before adjusting your morale score.""

A drone passed overhead, its lens irising open with a soft chirp as it scanned the attendees. Dirk tilted his head, held his breath. The drone hovered briefly over him. Beeped. Then moved on.

It didn’t recognize him. Or it had been told not to.

He leaned forward slightly, squinting at the wax seal. Red, unbroken, pressed with the sigil of the Ministry of Mortality Oversight. The mark of an unquestioned death. Not something they gave out lightly. And never to a Hunter whose file hadn’t been triple-verified.

The mark of a cover-up.

 

After the ceremony, attendees were directed to a side room labelled “Communal Grief & Refreshments.” Dirk waited until the crowd had filtered away—nobody lingered long, not for him—then rose and moved silently down a side corridor behind the altar.

The hallway was too clean. Too orderly. Too... deliberate. The lights buzzed overhead with the slow certainty of institutional decay. A maintenance drone with one broken leg skittered past him, dragging a cable like a leash. Its display flashed ERROR: MAINTENANCE LOOP DETECTED.

Dirk ignored it.

The prep rooms smelled worse. Bleach and despair and synthetic regret. He passed cold drawers with toe tags printed in bulk. One drawer hung ajar, labelled ""HUMAN EFFLUVIA (UNSORTED)."" A box of cremation dust sat on a nearby cart, its label peeling: *Generic Hunter Template.* A form-filler bot snored softly in a corner, its ink cartridge dripping onto the floor, one arm mid-stamp.

Then: voices, quiet, just on the edge of comprehension.

He hesitated outside a door with a frosted-glass window that read RECORDS. The light inside flickered like a nervous eye. He peeked through the crack.

Grint was there, hunched over a terminal, furiously tapping keys akin to maniacal strokes of an organist on the edge. The screen flashed red. Denied. He cursed under his breath, checked a secondary panel, tried again. Denied.

Dirk didn’t knock.

He pushed the door open with a slow creak.

Grint looked up—and went pale.

“You’re… you’re supposed to be dead!”

Dirk stepped inside, shut the door behind him and flashed him one of those cheeky grins.

“Yeah? And you’re supposed to be competent. But here we are.”

Grint backed into a filing cabinet, fingers twitching as if searching for an excuse he hadn’t filed yet.

“This—this isn’t what it looks like.”

Dirk grabbed the nearest data-slab. His name. His ID. A digital death certificate. Stamped. Approved. Filed under D7-Priority Clearance. Witness field: blank.

He opened a drawer. Requisition slips. All marked ‘ASSETS RECYCLED.’ Ration cards. Weapons licenses. Implants. Faith chits. All reissued using IDs flagged as deceased.

Dirk turned slowly. “You’ve been declaring Hunters dead and redistributing their gear.”

Grint swallowed. “It’s a clean system! We only use IDs flagged inactive. It’s efficient. Sustainable!”

“You buried me to balance the books.”

Grint raised his hands. “The system isn’t perfect. But no one notices. No one cares.”

“I noticed.”

There was a pause. A long one.

Then, from behind Dirk—

Click.

The distinct sound of a greasy, yet well maintained flechette pistol being cocked.

Dirk didn’t turn. He sighed. “Tell me that’s not the organist.”

“It is,” Grint said quietly. “He’s also our crisis manager.”

Dirk turned. Slowly.

The organist—now wearing combat gloves, a hardened grimace, and the gleam of someone who moonlighted as a hymnal hitman, raised the gun with practiced familiarity. Behind him, a shelf of unused hymnals glowed softly with synth-ink prayers.

Dirk grimaced. “I hate funerals.”

The man fired as Dirk dropped.

Glass shattered behind him. Dirk rolled, grabbed a casket dolly, and launched it toward the shooter. The organist stumbled backward, colliding with the lectern. Dirk grabbed a metal urn from the table and flung it like a discus.

It hit the man in the neck.

He crumpled, gurgling hymnals.

Dirk stood, breath ragged.

He turned to Grint, who was already trying to slink out the side.

“I think we need to talk,” Dirk said, reaching for his sidearm.

Dirk gave chase as Grint bolted. He may be old, but Dirk still had the sprightly step of a track athlete on all manner of illicit substances, of which, Dirk was.

Grint wasn’t fast, but panic gave him a kind of slippery momentum, like an eel soaked in tax fraud. He crashed through a swinging bulkhead door labelled ""ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTUM – STAFF ONLY"" and bolted down a narrow corridor lined with mismatched floor tiles, flickering lights, and file cabinets that groaned like dying priests in confession. One cabinet tipped slightly as Grint brushed it, dislodging a stack of requisition forms that fluttered in his wake like bureaucratic feathers.

Dirk followed at a steady pace, flechette pistol gripped loosely, boots slapping against a floor that had clearly been mopped with something more acidic than water, the soles hissing as he went. His coat flared with each step, trailing smoke and a faint chemical tang. Overhead, aging light panels stuttered between working and not with each passing second, casting Dirk in a strobe of menace, even the lights weren’t Dirk’s friends.

“Grint!” he called, half-laughing, half-snapping. “If I have to run, someone’s paying by the hour!”

The corridor abruptly ended at a service hatch; its metal frame buckled slightly from age or fury. Grint dove through it with the grace of a frightened bureaucrat, thudding against the far ladder before disappearing into the dark below. Dirk reached the edge just in time to hear the clang of feet hitting rusted rungs.

He sighed. “Of course it’s a ladder, never a nuclear escalator when you need one”

Grumbling, he swung over the edge and began the descent.

 

The sublevel was colder. Older. Forgotten. It felt like stepping into the city’s memory—a memory soaked in toner and left to rot. Faint emergency lighting pulsed along the walls like a dying heartbeat, washing everything in dim red tones. Filing cabinets stood in rows, some wrapped in ancient plastic tarps, others buckled open like broken jaws. Everything was damp. Everything smelled like wet cardboard, old skin, and burned apologies.

A sign overhead read: *MORTALITY STORAGE – DO NOT REPROCESS WITHOUT FORM 83C.*

Dirk’s boots hit the floor with a splash, and he caught a glimpse of Grint stumbling into an open archive room ahead. The man disappeared behind stacks of crates marked with various labels: HUNTER ASSET – STALE, NON-CITIZEN CHIT SURPLUS, UNCONFIRMED REMAINS. Dirk followed, slowing now, his senses stretching out.

The archive was cavernous—an ossuary of lost paperwork. Crates towered to the ceiling. Bins overflowed with faded dossiers, death declarations half-shredded and reassembled, faith requisitions stamped with obsolete sigils. Overhead pipes dripped steadily onto a floor already slick with mildew and failure. The hum of ancient ventilation echoed faintly like a machine trying to forget.

Grint sagged into a chair in the centre of the room, panting, arms limp. He looked like a man who had finally realized the extent of his crimes—and that his exit strategy had expired years ago.

Dirk entered slowly, pistol lowered but still visible.

“You know,” he said, “when I said we needed to talk, I didn’t mean in a crypt full of retired bureaucracy.”

Grint wheezed, clutching his ribs. “You weren’t supposed to see this.”

Dirk raised an eyebrow. “Because I was supposed to be dead?”

“Yes! You were declared! Signed, sealed, processed! Everything aboveboard!”

Dirk circled a crate, running a finger along the dusty lid. “Except the part where I’m breathing. Bit of a sticking point.”

Grint’s shoulders sagged deeper, like gravity had finally remembered him.

“It started small,” he muttered. “Unclaimed gear. A few inactive IDs. Nobody questioned it. Then we found a way to fast-track the system. Flag a few Hunters as dead. Submit the forms. Collect the assets. Reroute the gear into supply chains. Sell the excess to... unofficial outlets.”

“Like black market enforcers. Or worse,” Dirk said flatly.

Grint flinched. “It wasn’t like that at first. We only touched IDs that hadn’t pinged back in months. Then someone submitted yours.”

Dirk stepped forward, gaze narrowing. “Who?”

“I don’t know! The request came from Central. A G-class override. No name, no trace.”

“Bullshit.”

“I swear,” Grint said, voice cracking. “Your file was pulled. It passed three checks. I thought you really were dead.”

Dirk stared at him, pistol steady, tension crawling into his fingers. The air in the archive thickened, silent and judgmental.

“And you just… went along with it.”

Grint nodded miserably. “I buried the paperwork. Not the man.”

Dirk raised the gun slightly. “The paperwork’s still talking.”

A new voice cut in from behind a stack of crates:

“That’s because it hasn’t finished processing.”

Dirk spun, weapon up, hammer cocked.

A figure stepped into view, deliberate and calm. She wore a Ministry-grey longcoat crisp with pressed authority, a badge gleaming on one lapel, and a stun baton hanging from a belt that bristled with legal threats.

“Hello, Strangelove,” she said, her voice smooth as static. “We’ve been monitoring this little funeral farce for a while. It’s just… unfortunate you decided to attend it.”

Dirk’s aim didn’t waver. “Ministry Oversight?”

She smiled faintly. “Worse. Inventory Control.”

She stepped forward slowly, boots echoing against metal grates. Her eyes gleamed with the cold certainty of someone who had never filed a form incorrectly in her life.

“You’ve interfered with a sanctioned salvage protocol. You’re unauthorized, unregistered, and—technically speaking—deceased. Which means, legally, I can put you in the ground without triggering a single disciplinary form.”

Dirk fired.

She moved fast—faster than expected, as fast as those cyber freaks—and ducked behind a cabinet as the flechettes ripped through outdated shelving units. Paperwork exploded in a cloud of obsolescence; centuries of forms reduced to confetti. A red strobe flared in the ceiling.

Alarms screamed to life. A voice shrieked from unseen speakers:

“UNREGISTERED ACTIVITY DETECTED IN MORTALITY ARCHIVE. PLEASE INITIATE END-OF-LIFE PROTOCOLS.”

Dirk ducked behind a crate labelled RATION LOG – TERMINATED, coughing through the dust.

“This is how you handle inventory errors?!”

The woman returned fire—her baton crackling with energy and launching a bolt of stunning static. It splashed across the floor, scorching it black and melting part of a Form 12 stack into sludge.

“This was supposed to be clean,” she hissed from behind cover. “Nobody even liked you!”

“Mutual!” Dirk barked back. Fucking Ministry oversight.

Grint, forgotten in the crossfire, tried to crawl toward a side door, but the woman spotted him. With no hesitation, she hurled a stapler across the room. It struck him in the temple with a thunk and dropped him like a failed audit.

“Grint was sloppy,” she called. “You? You’re just inconvenient.”

Dirk levelled his pistol, squeezed the trigger—and heard the click.

Nothing. Empty.

He stared at it for a second, incredulous. “Right. Forgot to resupply after the monastery shootout,” he muttered, as if remembering an unpaid bill. “Classic.”

The woman was advancing now, baton whining with pent-up voltage.

Dirk’s hand dipped into his coat. He pulled out a prayer bead—charred black from overuse, glowing faintly at the seams. A crackling relic of desperate faith, equal parts explosive and bad idea.

“You’re gonna love this part.”

He hurled it.

The explosion was small but potent, faith-charged and poorly blessed. Shelves buckled. Fire sparked. Lights shattered. The woman flew backward with a shriek and slammed into a row of caskets labelled READY FOR DISPOSAL.

Dirk ran.

He sprinted through the darkened corridor, heart pounding, lungs burning from a heady cocktail of dust, ozone, and bureaucratic negligence. The archive behind him howled with fire and klaxons, echoing like a dying cathedral built out of filing cabinets and prayer forms. Papers fluttered down in his wake like bureaucratic ash, burning softly as they met flame. Somewhere in the distance, a fire suppressant system coughed once, wheezed a final warning in monotone, and promptly gave up.

He burst through a reinforced door into what looked like a cremation overflow chamber. The lighting here was worse: a sickly, strobing green cast from half-dead fluorescents that blinked in rhythmic agony. Dozens of rusted incineration units lined the walls, each bearing a different state of disrepair—some with doors half-ajar, others blinking ERROR, PROCESSING or just HELP in slow, hopeless digital pleas. The air was thick and cloying, a heady blend of scorched prayers, melted laminate, and decades of dried-up solemnity. A faith-soaked mausoleum for logistical sins.

Behind him, the hatch burst open with a hydraulic gasp. The Inventory Control agent stepped through the smoke—bruised, bleeding, but unbroken. Her grey coat was scorched at the hem, and one sleeve dangled in shreds, but her baton still hissed with violent energy. Smoke curled from her shoulders like ceremonial incense, and her eyes burned—not with righteousness, but with bureaucratic wrath. She was vengeance wearing a barcode.

“Strangelove!” she bellowed, her voice amplified by some internal modulator. “You’re unregistered, unclaimed, and unimportant!”

Dirk ducked behind a broken trolley stacked high with empty urns. They rattled ominously as he landed. He peeked out, grinned, and called back, “Don’t undersell me. I’m also uninsured.”

She hurled a static bolt. It smashed into the trolley, detonating it in a blossom of ceramic dust and ash. The urns shattered like brittle lies. Dirk rolled sideways, coughing, and snatched a heavy coil of braided incense wire from a wall hook. Without hesitation, he flung it like a weighted net. It wrapped around her legs. She fell with a curse and a clatter but yanked free before he could close the distance. Her baton surged again, snarling blue light.

“This is your last audit!” she screamed, stumbling to her feet.

Dirk seized a nearby cart and upended it. A stack of unlabelled urns spilled across the floor like the most tragic game of jacks ever played. One shattered at his feet. The ashes within hissed as they met the small fire licking its way along the back wall.

“You bureaucrats and your paper firetraps,” Dirk muttered, then, with a little theatrical flair, kicked the remains into the open flame of an active incinerator

The fire jumped like it had been waiting for permission.

In seconds, the wall ignited. A pipe—either gas or embalming fluid, or some hybrid horror—burst overhead. A gout of pressurized chemicals sprayed across the ceiling and caught flame with a whoosh that drove both combatants momentarily to cover.

The agent shrieked in frustration and backpedalled, slipping in the slick pooling on the floor. She caught herself against a metal rail, hair now lit at the tips like a candlelit vigil

""System overload,"" chimed a speaker in a voice that tried to be helpful but sounded deeply amused. ""Combustion imminent.""

Dirk turned, scanning for exits, when he spotted Grint—somehow still alive, crawling in through a secondary hatch with the determination of a bureaucrat desperate to salvage a pension. His face was bloodied, eyes glassy with panic. Dirk considered leaving him, then cursed and crossed the room, ducking as sparks rained from a shorting fuse box.

He grabbed Grint by the collar and yanked him up just as the cremation chamber’s backup generators kicked in with a roar. More fires blossomed. Alarms howled. Sprinklers activated and promptly sprayed embalming foam. Everything ignited again.

Dirk dragged Grint toward the emergency exit—a metal door blackened by smoke and heat. The security terminal next to it blinked an apathetic red. ACCESS DENIED. Its fingerprint reader was cracked. Its retina scanner was melted.

Dirk grunted, holstered his pistol, and shoved his left cybernetic hand into the panel.

The terminal sparked violently, the lights dimmed—and then, with the pained groan of something realizing it had failed its purpose, the door hissed open just enough to admit a fleeing Hunter and a semi-conscious embezzler.

Dirk kicked it the rest of the way.

 

Outside, the storm had grown biblical. Rain pelted the alley like shrapnel from a divine bureaucracy. Thunder rolled across the skyline like a slow-moving audit. Dirk stumbled through the exit, every inch of him steaming, soaked, or smoking. Grint slumped beside him, unconscious again. Dirk propped him up against a rubbish bin labelled CONFIDENTIAL DISPOSAL and took a moment to breathe.

Behind them, the cremation wing of the funeral home gave a final, exhausted groan. Then came a dull *whump* as the backup fuel reserves caught. A fireball surged into the sky, turning the building’s roof into a violent candle.

Somewhere within, a printer continued spitting out Form D7s into the flames.

Dirk wiped soot from his mouth, dug into his coat, and retrieved one last Regalement Blend. He lit it with a shaky thumb, took a drag, and watched the glow flicker in the reflection of the blaze.

Grint groaned, dazed. His eyes fluttered open to see the inferno.

“You cremated the evidence,” Dirk said, exhaling smoke. “That’s what I call a clean exit strategy.”

He walked.

Down boulevards slick with moral ambiguity and gutters that hadn’t been cleaned since the last civil audit. Gallows Reach sulked around him, its skyline punctuated by the hollow glow of neon regulations and windows that blinked out when stared at too long. The rain kept falling, stinging his face like unpaid invoices, soaking through his coat and dripping off the corners of his smirk.

He passed a noodle stand manned by a man with too many scars and too few permits. A flickering billboard offered end-of-life cremation plans with a complimentary loyalty badge. Dirk gave it a nod. Maybe next time.

His boots squelched as he walked, rhythmically pounding the cracked slabs of Ministry-approved concrete. He lit another Regalement Blend—possibly his last, but that was a problem for Future Dirk. The smoke rose into the mist like a missed deadline.

A part of him thought maybe there was a lesson to learn. Something about consequences. Or backup ammo. Or checking your own death certificate more than once a year. But the thought passed quickly, like most of his better ideas, drowned out by the city and the drink and the low thrum of leftover adrenaline.

He rounded a corner. There it was.

Sanctuary Headquarters: squat, defiant, and gently leaking smoke from three places it probably shouldn’t. A cracked neon sign buzzed overhead: *WELCOME BACK, HUNTER.* Someone had spray-painted *FOR NOW* underneath it in angry red strokes.

Dirk took a long drag, rolled his neck, and walked through the front doors.

Back into the grinder. Back into the job. Because while some men chase closure, Dirk Strangelove hunted forms of trouble you couldn’t submit in triplicate.

And trouble?

Trouble had just started filing the paperwork.

 

***End.***

 

 

**Appendix**

 

He didn’t stop walking. Home wasn’t really a place for Dirk Strangelove—not unless you counted the fourth sublevel in Sanctuary HQ with the broken coffee dispenser and the smell of dried gun oil. He was a Senior Hunter, which sounded important on the rare occasion it wasn’t being shouted sarcastically over a malfunctioning intercom.

Hunters were tools, blunted by repetition and sharpened by failure. They were deployed by Sanctuary—the last functioning remnant of institutional order in a world running mostly on fumes and formality. If something was bleeding through the cracks in the city’s soul—some creature, cult, corrupted ledger—Sanctuary sent a Hunter. If you were lucky, they sent someone else. If you were unlucky, you got Dirk.

He didn’t have spotless reports. He didn’t have medals. What he had was a survival record that defied both probability and common sense. He carried a silver-scripted flechette pistol with just enough ammo to be dangerous and never quite enough to be prepared. His left arm was cybernetic, charred from a job gone wrong and held together with spite and nonstandard wiring. He smoked cigarettes that hissed when lit and tasted like expired faith.

Sanctuary itself wasn’t a church, though it had confession booths. Wasn’t a militia, though it had an armoury big enough to justify a sermon. It was something worse: a department nobody remembered approving, tasked with maintaining balance in a world built on increasingly creative hypocrisy. Its agents weren’t loyal. They were stubborn. Dirk among them.

The world outside? A patchwork quilt of haunted metroplexes, rusted sky-arches, and ministries still pretending anyone was in charge. Monsters existed. Some had claws. Others had contracts. And faith? Faith worked—when it didn’t explode.

Dirk didn’t chase redemption. He chased leads. And if something truly needed to stay dead, he made damn sure the death certificate was filed—preferably by someone else.

He didn’t expect gratitude. Just silence—and maybe a working coffee machine for once",1,1754236504.0,HFY,1,1.0,False

### **Chapter 2: The Celestial Table**

The dining room at the **Celestial Coordination Directorate** was designed like a geosynchronous observatory: circular, high-domed, with a narrow vertical slit that tracked the movement of the planets through reinforced sapphire glass.

It was nearing dusk on the lunar calendar, but still early afternoon in the San Juan orbital. The table was set for five, but only two had arrived.

**Dr. Valeria Nieves-Rivera**, Director of Celestial Coordination, sat across from **Minister-General Leonor Esquivel**, head of Orbital Defense Integration. Between them was a bottle of dense black coffee liquor, and a rotating tray of flash-seared octopus, grilled cassava, and nut-flavored hydrofruit.

“You’re early,” Esquivel noted, adjusting the clasp of her flight collar.

“Saturn’s ahead of schedule,” said Valeria, her voice slow and gently amused. “He skipped a beat two hours ago. Minor tachygravitic drift. Likely nothing.”

“But you came anyway.”

“I like the food.” She sipped her liquor. “And I wanted to talk before the others arrived.”

---

Esquivel arched a brow. “About Sebastián?”

“Not directly.” Valeria leaned back. Her fingers steepled in the air. “About the wake he’s creating. He’s drawn down the military presence, returned the warhead, offered conciliations, and is investing heavily in *Spanish infrastructure*. But his posture is… defensive.”

“You think he’s planning something?”

“I think he’s preparing to survive something.”

A silence bloomed between them. Outside the dome, Europa had begun to transit across the slit — an amber eye gliding above a black sky.

---

Esquivel was the first to speak again.

“The Baron?”

Valeria smiled. “*Consuelo Bernal*. You say his name like he’s a fable. He’s not. He’s a capitalist with a chessboard and no knights. He’s consolidating property in post-EU Madrid — shipping routes, housing blocks, education contracts. And he’s promised *zero oversight* to investors in exchange for liquidity. He’s going to bring Spain to heel and sell it back as a launch site.”

Esquivel laughed once, but it was a breathless, worried sound.

“And Sebastián is letting him?”

“No,” Valeria said. “He’s feeding him.”

---

The door opened. Two more guests entered — **Under-Secretary Yolanda Cruz** and **Father Gabriel Mercado**, theological attaché to the Royal House. The dinner officially began.

But Valeria’s mind stayed elsewhere.

Because there was something in the stars she hadn’t yet told the others.

A slow ripple across the exosphere. A temperature rise inside the gravity shadows. Patterns she had only seen once before — during the failed Moon Accord, right before the orbital sabotage above Marseille.

And in Sebastián’s last communiqué to her, buried in the signature line, were these four words:

> *Observe Madrid, not space.*

---

As forks clicked and polite laughter rose, Valeria kept her smile measured.

But her eyes were already calculating.

1mgmpem,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mgmpem/explore_the_best_combination_water_boiler/,Explore the Best Combination Water Boiler Zojirushi CD-WCC30 Review,"The day I started using the Zojirushi CD-WCC30 was the beginning of a profound shift in how I heated and stored water. This water boiler and warmer is undeniably one of the most versatile kitchen gadgets I’ve ever laid my hands on. It boasts an elegant yet functional design that complements any countertop, especially with its polished finish and compact dimensions of 11.25""L x 8.25""W x 11.5""H.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this unit is thoughtfully compact, but it doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. Its silver and dark brown finish gives it a modern and premium look, which, in my opinion, fits perfectly in any kitchen setting. The handle is sturdy and ergonomic, making it easy to carry around when I need to relocate it. As someone with young kids running around, I deeply appreciate how stable it sits on the countertop—solid and unlikely to tip over.

**Ease of Use and Temperature Options**  
The microcomputer temperature control system is one of its most standout features. Setting it up was straightforward, and the four distinct ""Keep Warm"" settings (160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F) make it adaptable to so many needs. Whether I'm brewing green tea or preparing instant noodles, I can always count on having the perfect water temperature. The digital display showing actual water temperature in real-time is an added bonus—it leaves no guesswork, and I love not having to fiddle around with trial and error.

**Quick Temp Mode and Energy Efficiency**  
Quick Temp Mode grabbed my attention immediately as someone who’s conscious of saving energy. It heats the water directly to my desired keep-warm setting without going through a boil, meaning quicker results and reduced power consumption. I often use this feature when I’m in a rush and need warm water for bottled baby formula or to prep instant coffee. However, it is important to note that this mode skips the dechlorination process, which limits its usefulness if you’re working with tap water.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
The interior features a nonstick coating that truly delivers on the promise of easy cleaning. After months of use, scaling buildup hasn’t been an issue, and routine cleaning takes minimal effort. I can personally attest to its durability, thanks to the quality components that just feel robust. That said, the exterior can pick up smudges from frequent touch, which is a minor inconvenience at most.

**Advantages**  
What makes this water boiler stand out isn’t just its fancy features but how accessible and practical it is to a wide range of users.  
- The one-touch electric dispensing system is perfect for everyone from busy parents to older adults who would struggle with lifting a heavy kettle.  
- Wide water gauge window ensures I always know how much water is left, which is particularly useful during colder months when I find myself using it constantly.  
- Energy-saving timer (6–10 hours) is a thoughtful addition. It lets me set it up before bed, ensuring I have hot water ready first thing in the morning, which has quickly become part of my routine.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
However, as much as I enjoy this product, no gadget is perfect, and there are some things I wish Zojirushi could tweak.  
- A stainless steel exterior option would have been great for those who prefer a more smudge-resistant finish.  
- While the unit is not excessively heavy, it could’ve been lighter for easier portability when full.  
- I noticed the sound indicator can sometimes be too subtle if I’m not nearby, which might be an issue for those of us prone to multitasking.  

**Competitive Options**  
Having also tried similar appliances like Tiger’s water boilers or Panasonic’s models, I found Zojirushi leans more toward user-friendliness. Features like Quick Temp are what I’ve been missing in competitors, alongside the detailed water temperature display that other brands don’t always provide. While some alternatives might have a slightly larger capacity, I believe the Zojirushi CD-WCC30 strikes the right balance between size and utility. Tiger’s boilers, in particular, lack the same intuitive controls and take longer to clean due to less effective interiors.

**Value Proposition**  
For its feature set and the convenience it delivers, this water boiler justifies its cost. Sure, it’s not the cheapest water boiler out there, but you’re paying for reliability, precision, and energy-efficient design. I used to think any random kettle would do, but after transitioning to Zojirushi, I understand the difference in its quality. It’s the kind of investment that pays off, especially if you’re a tea or coffee enthusiast like me.

I am playing more video games, watching fun tv shows, eating junk food, and fooling around on the internet. The junk food cravings are especially concerning. Eating in general feels more pleasurable, particularly if it's food I personally enjoy, and I find myself actively seeking out those foods rather than just having passive thoughts about them. I would liken it to being stoned except I am actually mentally present and enjoying every episode, every bite.

1mgmov3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mgmov3/explore_best_electric_kettle_performance_with/,Explore Best Electric Kettle Performance with Peach Street PE1302,"Testing out the Peach Street PE-1302 Electric Kettle has been quite an experience. Right from the moment I unboxed it, I could tell it had an impressive design. The kettle’s body is made of clear, borosilicate glass combined with brushed stainless steel accents. This gives it not only a modern aesthetic but also seems built to withstand daily use. As someone who makes tea a few times a day, I can say the kettle fits seamlessly into my kitchen environment while adding a sleek touch. It has a nicely compact size, so it didn’t overwhelm my countertop, and the measurements marked on the glass are extremely helpful for precision when filling it up with water.

**Performance and Speed of Boiling**  
The first time I used this electric kettle, I was amazed by how quickly it brought water to a boil. With 1500 watts of power and that OTTER controller tech, boiling takes just minutes, which saves me a lot of time in the mornings when I’m desperately in need of coffee. What caught my eye—actually, what caught everyone’s eye—was the LED blue light that glows as the water boils. It’s both functional and oddly mesmerizing. The kettle holds up to 1.7 liters of water, which is enough for multiple cups, whether I’m preparing tea for guests or making instant noodles for my cousins when they visit.

**Key Benefits**  
- The auto shut-off feature ensures the kettle stops as soon as the water boils, which is a blessing for someone as forgetful as me who often leaves appliances running.  
- The concealed heating element means it’s safer, as there’s no risk of toxins leaching into the water, plus it’s easier to clean.  
- Its handle stays cool to the touch, making it easier to pour right after boiling.  
- The removable mesh filter is ideal if I want to brew tea directly in the kettle or infuse water with fruits.  

[Check Peach Street PE-1302 price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b0b2q7n54s/)

**Safe and Convenient Features**  
Beyond its sheer speed in boiling water, this electric water kettle boasts safety you can count on. I’ve noticed several times how quickly the auto-shutoff kicks in when the water reaches its boiling point. There’s also boil-dry protection in case you accidentally turn it on when it's empty—this is huge for households with kids or distracted adults. Its 360-degree rotating base makes it super convenient no matter where you’re standing. You can plop the kettle back on from any angle, and neat freaks like me love that the cord tucks away under the base.

**Build and Durability**  
The clear, durable glass construction not only looks visually appealing but also lets you keep an eye on the water level. You can’t help marveling at how the stain-free surface manages to stay blemish-free even after multiple uses. The stainless steel, which supports the top edge and spout, feels solid and long-lasting. I can be clumsy, so having something that can weather a bump or two without cracking is reassuring. This kettle feels like it’s ready to last me years, not months.

**Areas for Improvement**  
After a week of continual use, a few small flaws became apparent.  
- The lid doesn’t open wide enough for my liking, which can make cleaning tricky, especially when I accidentally let minerals start forming at the bottom.  
- While the blue LED is stunning, it’s not really a necessary feature—though I admit it’s hard to fault it since it’s purely cosmetic.  
- The glass can get quite hot after use, so you have to be cautious when handling it, even if the handle stays cool.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Peach Street PE-1302 to other electric kettles I’ve used, it easily outperforms the older stainless steel model I owned, which lacked automatic shut-off. However, if I were to compare it to something like the Cuisinart cordless model, the difference becomes trickier. The Peach Street kettle wins major points with its glass design and lower price range, but the Cuisinart model offers slightly more insulation to keep water warm longer. Another contender is the Breville glass kettle, although it costs significantly more, and I only saw small differences in its features like preset temperature settings. If you’re looking for something simple and effective, the Peach Street electric kettle definitely holds its ground.

**Budget-Friendly Options**  
When I consider this product's features—auto shut-off, boil-dry protection, sleek design—and compare it with kettles in the same price range, it’s clear you get substantial value for your investment. A lot of budget kettles struggle to combine aesthetics with practicality, but this kettle nails both. Sure, it doesn’t have advanced options like temperature settings, but honestly, for most casual users, those aren’t necessities. If someone in your circle is a regular tea drinker or loves the convenience of pre-boiled water, this product would make a thoughtful yet economical gift.

I’ve worked my way through a parade of coffeemakers over the years, most of which were either unnecessarily complicated or so simple they lacked basic functionality. This machine strikes a comfortable balance, combining ease of use with thoughtful advanced features. With its classy curved design and pitch-black finish, this coffee brewer doesn’t just make a mean cup but also earns its spot on the countertop for sheer aesthetics alone.

**Design that Blends Beauty and Functionality**  
One glance at the Cuisinart coffee machine, and you're struck by its modern yet approachable design. Its curved body and compact size fit snugly in my kitchen, easily finding a permanent home alongside my other appliances. The buttons and LCD clock are straightforward, avoiding any of that ""how-do-I-even-turn-this-on"" frustration. My aunt, who isn't the most tech-savvy person, was able to program it without looking helpless—which is more than I can say for many gadgets in her life! Bonus points for the ergonomic handle on the carafe; it’s comfortable to grip and pours without any annoying dribbles.

**Ease of Use and Programmable Wonders**  
The programmable feature has to be my favorite aspect. Setting the brew to bubble to life 10 minutes before I roll out of bed transformed my mornings. The 24-hour advance presets mean even erratic schedules like mine can sync up with my caffeine needs. The Brew Pause feature is a lifesaver when I'm running late. I can sneak a cup of coffee mid-cycle without splashes as the brewing halts momentarily, which feels a little like magic every time. This might sound dramatic, but it honestly takes away that nagging wait for the cycle to end.

**Check Cuisinart DCC-1500TG price on Amazon.**

**Performance that Keeps You Warm Inside**  
The warming plate deserves its own fan club. It keeps coffee hot for up to two hours—perfect for those mornings when I take a little too long to finish the first cup. It even allows automatic shutoff, so I don’t have to panic halfway to work, wondering if I left it on. Plus, the taste? Superb. The permanent nylon filter and charcoal water filter team up to produce a brew that tastes fresh and clean, with none of that plastic aftertaste I’ve occasionally suffered from with other models.

**Highlights**  
- Sleek 12-cup capacity carafe, perfect for family gatherings or caffeine-fueled work marathons.  
- Intuitive LCD clock for advanced schedule programming makes brewing effortless.  
- Reusable permanent nylon filter—you save on single-use options and contribute less waste.  
- Brew Pause functionality is ideal for impatient coffee lovers like me.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The unit’s clean/descaling alert is helpful but triggers more frequently than expected, particularly if you have hard water.  
- While it’s lightweight (an advantage for portability), this can give it a slightly less sturdy feel compared to heavier models.  
- The button labeling could do with a bolder font or contrasting color for optimal visibility—important for sleepy morning eyes.  

**Competing Products**  
In the world of drip coffee machines, this model competes closely with contenders like the Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer and the Ninja CE251 Programmable Brewer. While Hamilton Beach offers added versatility with its single-serve option, its design is bulkier and less intuitive than the streamlined elegance of this brewer. Ninja's machines often boast higher wattage, providing faster brewing speeds but at the cost of increased noise. In comparison, the Cuisinart stands out for its combination of quiet operation, sleek design, and features like the keep-warm plate and reusable filters.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Considering the balance of features and ease of use, this coffee machine comfortably finds itself in the premium category without being prohibitively expensive. It's a rare blend of form and function that feels like you're upgrading your morning routine without breaking the bank. If convenient programming, reusable filters, and a design that doesn't sacrifice style for practicality light you up, it’s hard not to recommend this one.

1mgmjsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mgmjsc/adhd_coffee_nap_time_anyone_else/,ADHD + coffee = nap time? Anyone else?,"Hi everyone,
I was diagnosed with ADHD (predominantly inattentive type) last year, and I’m 36. I’ve basically lived on caffeine my whole life (mostly coffee and Coca-Cola), and so has most of my mom’s side of the family (which is also the ADHD side). All my aunts, my mom, and even my grandma are constantly drinking coffee. We’re also Portuguese, so it’s the strong, black, espresso-type coffee in tiny cups - basically a caffeine shot.

Here’s the weird part: I absolutely need caffeine to function. Just to do the most basic things in a day. But sometimes, depending on the time of day, if I drink a strong coffee… I literally fall asleep right after. Like, pass-out-on-my-desk level of sleepy (has happened too many times).

A couple of years ago I figured out that diluted coffee midday, between the regular stronger ones, helps keep me alert and balanced. But if I drink a full-strength espresso after lunch, it completely knocks me out.

What the hell is the logic behind that? Isn’t caffeine supposed to wake you up, period?

I know I could ask my psychiatrist or look up studies (and I probably have at some point), but I’d really love to hear from others who live with this. Is this a known ADHD thing? Is there a scientific explanation -
especially about the way strong vs. diluted coffee affects me so differently throughout the day?

Thanks in advance for sharing any experiences or info!

PS: here’s my typical caffeine routine:
	•	Wake-up: 1 straight espresso at home
	•	10 AM: strong espresso from a café (those are intense)
	•	12 PM: sometimes a diluted coffee
	•	1:30 PM: diluted coffee after lunch
	•	3/4 PM: another strong espresso
	•	5:30 PM: diluted or strong, depending on mood
	•	After dinner: espresso at home (if too strong, I sometimes fall asleep right after)

Also: I’ve been on antidepressants for 10 years (because no one figured out that all I actually had was ADHD).
I tried Concerta, ended up on the max dose, but had awful crashes after work. So I stopped.
Then I tried Elvanse/Vyvanse (30 mg), but it made me feel too wired, like I was on something intense. I started tapering off my antidepressants, and once I’m fully off, together with my doctor, we plan to restart Vyvanse at a lower dose. Wish me luck!

**Why This Pick?**

 Brad Lord will kick things off for the Nationals – and as a Relief Pitcher, I imagine he’ll only pitch a limited number of innings (though his last 2 outings saw him go a good 4 or 5 IP!) In any case, the Nationals bullpen continues to be the team’s biggest weakness. As they have in the last 2 games of this series, I fully expect the Brewers offense to run all over Washington. Pitcher Logan Henderson (1.71 ERA) will fill in for Jacob Misiorowski this afternoon; and while Henderson hasn’t pitched since May, the man is a flawless 3-0 having won all of his starts this season. There are plenty of picks to be made for this game, friends – but I’ll roll with the Over to cash for ‘Pick of the Day’.

1mgm6xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1mgm6xx/has_anyone_built_an_actual_found_family_after/,Has anyone built an actual found family after losing the one they thought they had? (Long post),"I (31F) have been having conflict and losing people in my life for the last year. I moved to a new city with my ex-boyfriend about 3 years ago. During that time, I build friendships with 3 women through work (2 of which I grew close with and 1 that was more of an every know and then hang out and consistent phone calls). 

The first falling out happened when I was beginning to realize that my relationship was ending. My ex boyfriend was hiding things from me and gaslighting me which led to an increase in my mental health symptoms—mostly anxious and reactive behavior. On top of this I was becoming isolated because I now worked from home (all of us changed jobs around the same time), seeing and talking to people less due to the schedule changes, and dealing with chronic illness flares due to the stress. 

During this time I met up with the 2 women I was really close with for lunch and we were discussing a tv show and I was explaining that I was embarrassed because my ex and I had a fight over this tv show and how I knew now I was being childish but in the moment because he was rooting for one particular character/storyline in the show it made me wonder about his character and how disappointed I was in the show as a whole. 1 of the women (who also really liked this show) was getting agitated with me and just kept saying “it’s just a TV show” and I would acknowledge that but was trying to finish my story when she had an outburst shouting at me to stop. I left that lunch and that evening I texted her that it didn’t feel good to be shouted at and that I would appreciate if she could communicate with me the next time if she feels I am talking about her. At first she was open to discussing what happen and repair but then it became about me and all these things she had been holding onto. I was admittedly hurt and reacted as such. She wanted time and I gave that to her but in the weeks that followed I decided that it would be best to not pursue repair because of some of the revelations she shared. 

Fast forward 2 months (3 weeks before my 31 birthday) and I find that my (now ex) boyfriend has a porn addiction and has been hiding numerous things, lying to me, among neglecting our relationship and our home. So we break up. This was devastating. I do not have parent or extended family. I have two aunts that I speak to once a month, my 2 you her brothers whom I was parentified to raise, and one long distance friend I talk to once a month. So losing my partner felt earth shattering. I also completely believed that this person loved me and was in a love story with me (delusional, I know) People showed up for me in a way that I am forever grateful and in my mind solidified their place in my found family. 

However after about 5 weeks—-I notice I’m not seeing or hearing from the 2 other women and when I am the interactions feel stifled and short. I start to get more anxious around this time but try and understand that people are dealing with their own breakups, life changes, etc the friend who I would just talk to every once in a while just kind of stopped wanted to talk or make plans. 

Fast forward a few weeks from that and I am now moving out of my shared apartment (that my ex left almost immediately). I actually moved closer to those in this friend group and 1 friend is within minutes. I told this friend excitedly we would be closer and she was happy too. But everytime I would try to invite her over to see the new place she would be busy or wouldn’t answer. Okay cool no big deal—she is way more extroverted than me and has like a huge group of people that love her and she loves! We were also going to go to a concert for her birthday together so I was confused but not worried —concert time comes a week after I had moved and this where I know I messed up. 

Moving is triggering for me and when I am in a cPTSD/autism shut down I get weirder than I already am and my ability to regulate my emotions diminishes significantly—so really I should not have gone. I drove us (me, my friend, 1 mutual friend we knew from the job we met at, and my friends bff) but it felt like they didn’t want me to? Idk the vibes in the car already felt off. Anyways—-people are really quiet in the car and sleeping on and off cool but I get paranoid about needing a party vibe but I just shutdown and focused on driving. Once we were there and everything I just was looking at me and comparing myself and I felt so bad and sad and honestly I just started to mentally break off about this time. I was un comfortable  and in so much pain. I knew it was weird and I couldn’t stop it but I was trying to celebrate her because I wanted her to have a good birthday. During the trip I heard how my friend and our mutual had gone on a trip and done all these other things—while I was begging for a cup of coffee. It twisted I knife I didn’t know I had in me. It didn’t help that my friend was also increasingly snappy with me and then I broke a bottle she had gotten for her birthday. 

After the trip it felt more strained. There were several events that I was invited to (one prior to the concert and then several last minute included) each event made my anxiety worse because I couldn’t connect and she continued to be snappy with me. 

I thought if I made more of an effort with people they would feel comfortable with me and maybe that would fix it. So I went out with the mutual friend to a jazz club and walked around and took pictures. I tried to explain some of what I was going thru and dealing with and the  advice I got (but didn’t ask for)  was basically if I don’t stop talking about it I’m victimizing myself and I just need to get on apps and meet people (even though I have said several times I’m not interested in dating—I just want to go places with my friends). I feel weird and disrespected after this hangout but she is the only one interacting me at this point on socials and such so I keep trying. 

About 7 weeks after the concert she responds to one of the texts I sent saying that she felt weird during the concert but didn’t quite know why until she had given it more thought and that it was due to the shock of never witnessing me center myself like that before (I wish I could give concrete examples but she didn’t give any). I followed up by trying to explain what I was going through at the time and when it was 12 plus hours of no response I anxiously texted a follow up that was long and cringey—-to which she said she needed to take some more intentional time to where she is putting her energy. It hurt to hear but I knew it was coming. I told her I understood and I’ll see her when I see her. 

*I want to add the she has stayed friends with the first women mentioned as well as others who have openly had issues with me*


I can see where I made mistakes (my own insecurities, my mental illness, my struggles to connect) 
and I feel that if those people wouldn’t have forged and confirmed found family bounds with me I wouldn’t have taken the relationships and breakdowns so seriously. I honestly don’t know what to do—I am embarrassed, ashamed, and hurt. I put a lot into all of those relationships—I showed up everytime in all the ways I could and I thought we had friendships that I could be open in and they could be open with me. So I guess my question is—has anyone gone through something similar before? What did you learn? Did you ever find your family? ",7,1754235136.0,AskWomenOver30,1,1.0,False

I have a list of things he's done for or to me, including what I've done to and for him and his responses. I'll keep this brief because I don't want to give too many details. We're in the same club, have similar interests, in the same major, similar hobbies, etc. I'm not sure how important this could be but he is on spectrum, I'm saying this just in case this could influence any thoughts possibly.

\- I'd continue to invite him to hang out over the next few months and he accepted them all. As well as talking to him on and off online when we had the time.

\- Greeted each other in the dining hall when we were getting our food, before going back to our seats and eating (we did not eat together), after he was done eating and going to leave, he came up to me to say bye (this stuck out to me the most because ive never heard or seen anyone do this before)

\- Lastly, I gave him a letter, and he also gave me something (two snacks, with one of them being my favorite fruit flavor that I mentioned once when we were talking about our favorite fruit.)

The letter wasn't a love letter just to be clear, it was mostly to show my appreciation and gratitude to being able to talk to him and hopefully get to know each other more. (although I never mentioned the word friend in the letter) And that I can't wait to see him once school starts again. Overall, I was just being completely honest.",2,1754234663.0,Crushes,2,1.0,False

I'm still healing from an abusive relationship where I was isolated from everyone, and I'm reconnecting with everyone who was severed from me.


Heck, I even started a new relationship. Can you believe that? I can't. 

But I'm happy.

I'm very happy.

I am surrounded by people that care for me for the first time in years but I don't know how to talk to them, I just wait around and hope they initiate because I have the social skills of a startled rabbit.

I'm doing well, but I still find it so, so hard to actually be vulnerable with the people around me and it upsets me.

I want to talk to them, I want to ask for their input on things, I want to share parts of my life with them, but all I can manage is sending memes and take forever to reply to their response for whatever reason.

This whole week has felt so intense, a lot of positive changes have happened, and all I've wanted was to get a coffee with an old friend but I can't find the courage to actually ask.

I don't know how to.

It should be as simple as ""hey, wanna catch up and get a coffee this week"", but it's not as easy anymore.

Sharing details about myself feels revolting and intrusive, but I know that's not true. That it's a reflection of the damage he did to me. 

It's hard to come to terms with the fact that I have an effect on people, and people care about whether or not I'm around.

You know what I used to do? When I was inaccessible  to everyone around me because of my ex?

I used to talk to myself, make little voice recordings to keep myself company and replay them for the sake of feigning a conversation I couldn't otherwise have with another person.

At my worst? I got hooked on ChatGPT.

I talked to it every day and it kept me company, helped me problem solve, offer support, and even helped me come to terms with the reality of what my ex was doing to me then offered me resources to cope.

It was a great tool to help see me through that time but I don't want to rely on some software to soothe my loneliness, I want to talk to a person.

I want to call up a friend and excitedly tell them about all I've been up to, ask if they've seen any good movies recently, maybe even if they want to meet up. 

But I'm still affected by this barrier between myself and other people.

Right now, I'm feeling a little rough and I'm craving talking to another person.

I want to call up my partner for comfort and I know he'd be there for me, he tells me so and he's only ever been supportive of me before, but I'm afraid.

I don't know how to talk to them.

## Context
I (15M) have had a crush on my 14F classmate – I'll call her K – for pretty much forever now (since we both enrolled in this school – i. e. 4 years ago). Back then, I was fat, ugly and annoying and aware of that, which lead to me not pursuing this crush at all, just painfully existing. 

On December 23rd, 2023, I've mustered up the courage (or to be precise, my friends have convinced me) to tell K that I have a crush on her and to invite her out, if all goes well. To my great surprise, she told me I was a “super chill and funny guy” and to keep it up and that even though she thinks we're a bit young to be dating, we can still be friends as there “isn't much of a difference between being friends and dating in our age”.

Eughhh... okay. We did go out – we went into the cinema to see Aquaman 2 (btw, a movie neither of us really cared about or knew the lore – it was just the only 4DX movie and I wanted to pick the best experience) and ate some McDonald's after that. Honestly – super awkward. We barely talked (about anything important anyway – she talked about school, mostly, then even met her friend I didn't know (super awkward btw) and I was so nervous, I couldn't do anything than just smile and nod).

After the Christmas break was over, we went back to school and we both acted like nothing – I was scared as I haven't ever talked to a girl I liked before and had no idea what to do, say, how to behave etc. and I'm pretty sure she didn't give a shit about me. Our class went on a ski trip where we had a “disco evening” – only thanks to J, I managed to get (about 30 seconds of) a slow dance with her. After that however, the “patch of no contact” started – we both talked when it was absolutely necessary, but I managed to take her out only once again after that and we ended up going to a coffee shop doing school tasks instead of to the museum I planned (lost 20 € cuz I didn't tell her before buying them :'( ) without any real outcome. (During this time period, she even started dating someone else while I was on a vacation for three weeks; I found out quickly – thanks, Insta – decided K can go to hell, stopped thinking about her and didn't even last a week before going back to her. Unhealthy, I know, but this is actually a recurring theme.) The awkward silence was occasionally broken by my unsure texts about nothing (like how are you, what are you doing etc. – loking back, no fucking wonder the convo died) guided by my “PR Manager” – my 14M friend imma call J. Now, J is pretty much my polar opposite when it comes to this – he is very extroverted, super outgoing, always knows what to respond, good with girls, you name it. J was always patiently guiding me through convos, putting together strategies regarding K with me, just a great friend I could always rely on and who always had my back. 

Now, this awkwardness broke with the start of the 2024 summer holidays – she started texting me first, enthusiastically, had me explain stuff I was passionate about to her, whatever. Not really important. We talked throughout the whole two months of summer tho. After coming back to school, my friends convinced me that it would be good idea to integrate K into our until-then-boys-only friend group. That we did and not long after that, we organized a sleepover at my house with the whole friend group (my mum insisted on K bringing another girl friend so she isn't the only girl there – that friend, whom I'm not assigning a letter because she isn't important, was, truth be told, an attention-seeking bitch whom nobody from our friend group really liked. Thankfully she went to sleep very early). Being the cheesy jokester I am, I even got some Hershey's Kisses (it's unbelievably hard to get them over here – ended up spending 5 € on the candy itself and 15 € on shipping) so I could ask her if she wanted a kiss with having the perfect backup plan. However, the vibe was nowhere near romantic – after everybody else went to sleep, it was me, K and J left there. J eventually went to sleep too, leaving me there alone with K (he later told me that he wasn't that tired and just wanted to give me a chance to make a move). Side note: I am a grammar nazi, guess K also got infected and a big-ish assignment was just turned in, so we used the opportunity and corrected some of our class's “dumb guys'” assignments. Stayed up the whole night and to be honest, we had an absolute blast. Nothing romantic happened, but oh well.

A big leap in our relationship was when I made a collage of her photos for her birthday and put it on my insta story (as for myself, I think it's a bit too much “out there” – I know I certainly don't care about these bday stories for other people – but J told me to do it and trusting him has always paid off, so who am I to judge). J was indeed right, K was super glad, said she loved it and after the conversation went on for a bit, she told me to stop being so awkward around her and that she's planning to marry me some day (in a 100% serious tone, but looking back she does have a tendency to say long term stuff like this and then change her mind is a few months). I even talked to her about two months after that about how I'd like to buy a castle, renovate it and live there eventually and she told me it's a great idea and that we can do it together when we're married.
After that, I felt like our relationship was improving along an exponential curve. We had another sleepover at the start of January, this time at K's place – we have each other presents and I gave K a blunt reference to an inside “joke” (or maybe just a rant we had together?). I don't think she even touched it to this day, but, at the risk of repeating myself – oh well. Had a nice time as well – had very deep late night conversations with K and J (J once again told me that he was making himself sound dumb on purpose so I could correct him or something, idrk).

Starting with this amazing sleepover (where I btw told her even about the sleep paralysis I got while dreaming about her (not even anything sexual, just walked up to her, tried to talk, she answered and I woke up with a BPM of 205 and unable to move – average Reddit moment)), a great month of this relationship has started. After that, we went on a 3 week vacation again and all my chances were fucked. We did chat a fair bit when I was gone, but the 6 hour difference didn't make it easy. After that, I came back to K being completely emotionally independent from me it felt like. We haven't even actually fully recovered, even though it felt like it at (rare) times.

One day, I've had enough – I guess I am not built for the conventional rizz game – I wrote everything I had to say on a piece of paper and gave her that paper. It was an A4-sized paper completely full with 11pt text. I talked about how I hate how we're separated emotionally and that I'm not sure if it even makes sense to go ahead with our friendship. She replied to that with 17 “bursty” messages saying she absolutely wants to continue our friendship, that she has also noticed we've been talking less but that's normal since we've both been tired from school and just stuff happening in our lives (not important).
 
With this configuration, we are hurtling towards the end of the year where our friend group went on a 7 day trip to Normandy (about 15 hours by bus). I wanted to take her out for an ice cream or something there, but have noticed my brain shifting from “seeing K as a romantic interest” to just “seeing K as a friend” (...thereby aligning my expectations with K's 💀). 

## Context TL;DR (“Ugh, quit rambling you jackass and get to the point”)
I've liked my classmate K (14F) for about 4 years now, 1,5 of which I've been trying to embrace it somehow. I haven't been very successful with anything for the first few months, then we started talking and everything was going well until this got ruined by me leaving for 3 weeks. At the end of the school year, our friend group went on a Normandy trip where the following incident happened. I was planning on taking K out for ice cream or something there. At that time, my brain realigned from seeing K as a romantic interest to just seeing her as a pretty much ordinary friend.

## The incident
I was assigned to sit next to (and have rooms with) my friend S – 14M – who has the amazing gift of being able to annoy the everloving fuck out of literally anyone. (Fun fact: he has locked me out of our room on the first night falling asleep promptly, forcing me to literally sleep on the ground). Due to this, all of my friends told me that I seemed very grumpy throughout this whole trip (I mean, fair).

Another unfortunate circumstance was that I got to board late, resulting in us (me&S) sitting 7 rows behind the rest of our group for the entire trip. We only managed to swap with someone for the final ride home.

During the entire trip, I've noticed K and J spending more and more time each other, talking more and idk what more (mostly from K's initiative). A few peeks over J's shoulder also told me that they texted a lot. Because of that and the overall mood (everybody was getting annoyed with each other quite quickly) as well as no good opportunity, my ice cream plan didn't work out in the end.

On the way back (btw, this was at about 2am on a gas station with some light rain starting – vibeous af I must say), Maty told me that Nela asked him out. I told him that I did notice they were getting very close and that if he does want to take her out in the end, I think he should. He was reluctant at first saying that it would completely tear the friend group apart and that he'll try to get out of it by saying he doesn't have any time, hoping her interest will eventually simmer out – he said this happens to him a lot and that he doesn't wanna date K. 

A few days ago, my friend A (who used to date K about 3 years ago and whom I consider my best friend now) told me that J and K have each other's initials in Morse code in their bio on Instagram alongside the 💐 emoji in J's case and the ✨ emoji in K's case.

I was thinking about texting J and asking what's up, but I can't think of a way to phrase it without me sounding like a jealous jerk. ",1,1754234578.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1mglxo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mglxo2/can_the_cuisinart_brew_central_14cup_coffee_maker/,Can the Cuisinart Brew Central 14-Cup Coffee Maker Revolutionize Your Morning? Review Inside,"The Cuisinart LK6565000C Brew Central 14-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker clearly caught my attention as someone who heavily relies on their morning caffeine boost to feel human. It’s not just a coffee maker, it’s a toolkit for crafting the perfect cup of liquid energy. Testing this coffee maker daily became one of those “where has this been all my life” kinds of experiences. And trust me, I’ve got a pretty solid relationship with coffee makers at this point. This one has its strengths, but also a couple of areas that might give you reason to pause.

**Design and Build Quality**

Strong first impressions were made by the sleek modern design of this coffee maker. It seamlessly blends stainless steel accents with a black finish, fitting beautifully into any kitchen style. Measuring 5""D x 5""W x 12""H, it’s compact enough for even smaller countertops. Plus, the 14-cup glass carafe not only looks durable but also boasts a dripless spout and a comfortable, cool-to-touch handle. I appreciated how well it avoided making a mess when pouring – not something every machine gets right! For those who like modern vibes in their appliances, its aesthetic is definitely a bonus. 

**Ease of Use and Functionality**

Using this coffee maker felt a bit like working with a personal barista – except it doesn’t roll its eyes at your overly complicated coffee preferences. It’s fully automatic and allows you to program brewing up to 24 hours in advance. The clear-view water window makes filling it up a non-issue. Adjusting the brew strength between regular and bold was as simple as pushing a button. Its 1-4 cup setting was ideal for mornings when I didn’t need the full 14 cups, which, let’s face it, isn’t super common unless you’re hosting an entire brunch. 

**Check [Cuisinart LK6565000C] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Brew Quality**

Beyond its appearance and ease of use, performance is where the real magic happens. This coffee maker delivers perfectly hot coffee consistently, which is not something I can say for every machine out there. Even with the bold brew setting, the taste struck the perfect balance—strong without crossing into bitter territory. A heating plate that keeps coffee warm for up to four hours adds practicality for people like me who don’t always down their first cup in one go. What amazed me most is how the gold-tone filter enhanced the flavor by keeping impurities out. 

However, I noticed the brewing process isn’t whisper-quiet. If you’re sensitive to noise during your 5 a.m. coffee ritual, this machine might come off as slightly intrusive. It’s not loud enough to be unpleasant, just enough that you’ll hear it percolating away.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

This coffee maker is one of the easiest appliances I’ve ever had to care for. Between its self-cleaning feature and the indicator that signals when it’s time for a decalcification session, maintenance has been a breeze. The reusable gold-tone filter eliminates the constant need to buy paper ones, which means fewer trips to the store and less waste. Still, rinsing the filter regularly is necessary as coffee grounds can cling stubbornly. If there’s an aspect of cleaning that’s slightly tedious, it’s wiping down the heating plate. Spills tend to get baked on if not addressed promptly, but that’s nitpicking at best.

**Pluses**

- Fully automatic with programmable features, including 24-hour brew start.
- Brew strength customization (regular or bold).
- Heating plate retains warmth for hours post-brew.
- Sleek design with both style and durability in mind.
- Self-cleaning with a clear decalcification reminder.

**Negatives**

- Noise levels during brewing could be quieter.
- Heating plate can require extra attention for cleaning.
- Control panel backlight is a little too bright for darker spaces.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this coffee maker to other popular alternatives raises some interesting discussions. For instance, Keurig machines with their pod-based systems are more aimed at single servings and convenience rather than catering to a crowd. While you’re trading off quantity, Keurigs are often quieter and faster, but the flavor depth doesn’t quite compete with what this machine pulls off. Meanwhile, Breville costs more but offers precision and sleek designs – although, in my experience, the maintenance is slightly trickier.

For someone who prioritizes brewing a large batch of coffee for home or office environments, this product edges out many others with features like a robust glass carafe, reusable filters, and brew strength adjustment. However, if noise is a dealbreaker, quieter drip machines like the Bonavita may better suit your needs.

**Price Worthiness**

Looking at everything this coffee maker does, it’s definitely positioned in the ""affordable luxury"" category. Sure, it’s not a budget machine, but the features you get here justify the investment. For what it offers in terms of capacity, durability, and taste-enhancing elements, it feels priced just right. Alternatives in the same price range may streamline one or two functions better, but rarely cover all bases like this product does.

1mglx8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mglx8z/vyvanse_any_benefit_to_off_days/,Vyvanse - any benefit to “off days”?,"tl;dr - i’m wondering if anyone else feels extremely tired, like they can’t wake up, on days when they don’t take their Vyvanse

Details: 
I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD since I was a kid (I’m now in my 40s). it wasn’t until about a year ago that I discovered people talking about Vyvanse on this sub. so I asked my doctor about it as an alternative to the other meds that i’d come to hate over time because of their quick highs and fast/deeply “whooosh” lows. I was just white-knuckling it, with coffee in the morning, and again somewhere around 2:30 or 3p.  Like anything else, I’ve assumed that my body could benefit from a break. Even if it’s just a day or two, without Vyvanse. So I reserved weekends.
but each time I try that, I find that I cannot wake up in the morning at all. 
each time I try that, it’s like there’s a cloud inside my head and behind my eyes, and I cannot wake up at all .
Does anyone know if there’s even any benefit to taking these kinds of breaks? Or is it not necessary at all?",2,1754234481.0,ADHD,14,1.0,False

1mglvqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewesdIt/comments/1mglvqp/how_headway_is_changing_how_we_learn_and_grow/,How Headway Is Changing How We Learn and Grow,"Do you ever feel like there are a million books you ""should"" read, but you just don't have the time? Between work, family, and everything else, it's tough to sit down with a huge novel or a dense non-fiction book. But what if you could get the key ideas from the world's best books in just 15 minutes?

That's where **Headway** comes in. It's a game-changing app that gives you bite-sized summaries of top non-fiction books, helping you learn new skills, grow your mind, and become a better version of yourself—without needing hours of free time. This isn't just about reading less; it's about learning more, faster. Ready to start your learning journey today?

👉[**Try Headway for yourself and get started!**](https://dorinebeaumont.com/g/0lsosy937l2d6220c6fc8cba3b3b49dc5c3823be/)



## What Is Headway?
**Headway** is a microlearning app designed for busy people. It's like having a personal library of knowledge that fits in your pocket. The app takes popular non-fiction books on topics like self-help, business, history, and productivity and condenses them into easy-to-digest summaries. These summaries, or ""insights,"" can be read or listened to in about 15 minutes.

Who is this app for? It's perfect for students, professionals, parents, and anyone who wants to learn but doesn't have the time for traditional reading. If you've ever wanted to get the main takeaways from books like *Atomic Habits*, *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, or *Think and Grow Rich* without the commitment of reading the whole thing, **Headway** is built for you.



## Key Benefits of Using Headway
**Headway** offers a powerful way to absorb knowledge efficiently. Here are some of the most significant benefits I've personally seen:

* **Saves Time:** This is the most apparent benefit. In just 15 minutes, you can learn the core concepts of a full-length book. You can use this time during your commute, while you're waiting for an appointment, or even during a coffee break.
* **Boosts Your Knowledge:** The app covers a huge range of topics. I've learned about everything from neuroscience to negotiation tactics, all in quick, manageable sessions. It's an easy way to stay curious and informed.
* **Improves Retention:** Because the information is broken down into key points, it's easier to remember. The app also uses features like quizzes and highlights to help you recall what you've learned.
* **Inspires Deeper Reading:** Often, a **Headway** summary will spark my interest so much that I'll buy the full book. It's a great way to ""test drive"" a book before you commit to reading it all the way through.

The ability to learn something new every day, even when life is hectic, is truly invaluable. It's a tool for continuous personal and professional growth.

## How Headway Works: A Simple Process
The process is straightforward. When you download the app, you'll be asked about your interests and goals. Based on your answers, **Headway** creates a personalized learning plan for you.

Each day, it will suggest a new book summary to explore. You can either read the summary with text and engaging graphics or listen to the audio version. The content is broken down into simple sections, so you never feel overwhelmed.

For example, a summary of a book might be divided into five key insights. You read or listen to each one, and by the end, you have a solid understanding of the book's central message. The app even includes a fun ""Today's Insights"" feature to keep you motivated.



## What's Inside Headway: Key Features
The app is packed with features designed to make learning fun and effective.

* **Daily Insights:** Get a new, personalized book summary every day based on your goals.
* **Spaced Repetition:** This feature helps you review key ideas from previous summaries to make sure the information sticks.
* **Highlights & Notes:** You can highlight your favorite parts and save notes, just like you would in a real book.
* **Collections:** The app organizes books into special collections like ""Boost Your Productivity"" or ""Manage Your Finances,"" making it easy to find books on a specific topic.
* **Audio Summaries:** All summaries have high-quality audio versions so that you can learn hands-free.

While the app isn't a substitute for reading a full book, it's a handy tool for getting the core ideas and deciding if you want to dive deeper.



## Headway: Pros and Cons
Every product has its strengths and weaknesses. Here's an honest look at what I've found with **Headway**.

###**Pros:**

* **Time-Efficient:** Perfect for anyone with a busy schedule.
* **Personalized:** The app tailors recommendations to your interests.
* **Broad Library:** A massive selection of best-selling non-fiction books.
* **Affordable:** A cost-effective way to get the gist of dozens of books.
* **Engaging Format:** The mix of text, audio, and graphics makes learning enjoyable.

###**Cons:**

* **Lacks Depth:** You won't get the full experience, examples, or detailed stories from the original book.
* **Not for Fiction:** This app is focused on non-fiction only.
* **Subscription Required:** While there's a free trial, you need a subscription for full access.

Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, especially if your goal is to quickly grasp key concepts from a wide range of books.



## What Users Are Saying
One of the best ways to judge a product is to see what real people are saying. I've seen countless positive reviews from users who were struggling to find time to read.

Here's a verified quote from a user on a popular app store: ""I've always wanted to read more but never found the time. **Headway** has made it so easy to learn about new things on my lunch break. I feel so much more productive!""

Another user shared, ""The summaries are spot-on. They capture the essence of the books perfectly. I've already recommended it to all my friends."" This feedback is consistent with my own experience—the app genuinely delivers on its promise.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Is Headway safe to use?** Yes, the app is a trusted and well-regarded platform. It works by summarizing publicly available books and is not associated with any health or medical claims.

**How long will it take to see results?** You'll see ""results"" right away. After your first 15-minute summary, you'll have new knowledge. The long-term benefits of learning and applying these concepts will build over time with consistent use.

**Are there any side effects?** Since this is a learning app, there are no physical side effects. The only ""side effect"" might be a desire to read more and apply what you've learned!

**Is there a refund or guarantee?** **Headway** typically offers a free trial so you can test it out before you commit to a subscription. Check their official website for the most up-to-date refund and cancellation policies.

Like many of you, I find most AI writers not that good. 
But writer's block is a real problem, it’s not because I have nothing to say, but because I’m unsure what actually matters. 

So, I'm building a Chrome extension that takes the opposite approach. It's an AI ""thinking partner"" that **never writes for you**. Its only job is to ask smart questions when you get stuck, helping you clarify your own thoughts.

When you pause typing in Google Docs, Notion, or an email, a little companion pops up near your cursor and gives you a gentle guide to get your thoughts flowing again.

The goal is to help you think, not to write on your behalf:
*   It asks clarifying questions like, ""What's the core point you're making here?""
*   It helps you explore counter-arguments or find new angles.
*   It suggests words without intrusive autocomplete, so you always have the final say.
*   It only activates on pause, and you can turn it off anytime.

I'd love your feedback as I refine this. I'm trying to create a tool that genuinely helps without taking over the creative process.

*   What would make a tool like this genuinely useful for your workflow?
*   Where do you write most in your browser (Google Docs, Notion, email, etc.)?
*   Would you pay a small subscription (e.g., price of a coffee per month) for a tool that saves you from writer's block?

I'm also looking for a handful of beta testers. If you're interested in trying it out, drop a comment and I'll reach out!

I've spent basically my entire weekend glued to my computer, fueled by coffee and a mission. I just launched the first version of a tool to solve a problem I'm sure we've all faced: the dreaded 'IKEA Overwhelm'.

You know the feeling. You walk in for a €50 LACK shelf and walk out €500 poorer with a car full of things that looked great in the showroom but don't quite work in your actual, messy room. I hate that feeling. Or, you just need to have your room renovated with IKEA, but it's not really easily make an agreement with your partner, because you both are imagining how it might look like, but you're not seeing it in reality.

So, I built **IKEALOGY**.

The idea is dead simple:

* For **€5**, you send me a picture of a room in your house.
* I send you back a realistic design concept using **ONLY currently available IKEA products**.
* You get a concrete shopping list, so you have a battle plan *before* you brave the store.

**Now for the super honest part.** Right now, this is a total ""Wizard of Oz"" operation. There is no fancy AI (yet!). It's just:

1. A landing page I built this weekend.
2. A simple payment link.
3. A form that collects your room photo.
4. Then **me, a real human**, manually creating your design concept and emailing it back to you (I actually use AI tools under the hood... but we first analyze your photo, see what matches better and gives it better harmony, then we do the design)

My only goal for the rest of today is to get just **one** person to try it out. Not to get rich, but just to prove to myself that this isn't a completely crazy idea before I invest more time and money into building the real thing that works with AI right out of the box.

If you have a room that needs some love and want to be my very first customer, you would absolutely make my weekend.

You can check out the site here: [**https://www.ikealogy.com/**](https://www.ikealogy.com/)

Honestly, any feedback on the idea would be amazing. Thanks for letting me share my weekend project with you all!

This is my first post here and I'm excited to see what you all think. Hopefully I explain this properly. Let's dig in, shall we? 

I (32F) have a cousin, we'll call him Tom (42M) who had been married for 13y to a wonderful woman, we'll call her Cindy (42F). They were by all means, the dream couple. Amazing careers, no shortage of money, amazing home, cars, you get it. They had two gorgeous daughters together and by all means seemed they were the embodiment of the American Dream. This spring, I noticed some.. weird activity on Facebook with them. I normally don't find the need to check in on them, they're way better off than I've ever been and they've always been very healthy, happy, etc. Tom's posts were very dry all of a sudden, no swooning over his wife any longer. Cindy was all about the girls, nothing else (nothing wrong with that typically but they were constantly posting how great the other was) and then it happened. Mother's Day. He said nothing but posted a selfie with their mutual friend, we'll call her Brianna (34F) and she was kissing his cheek. Backing up a little, Brianna was married to her highschool sweetheart, Tyler (34M) for roughly the same amount of time and they also had three children together. Both couples were very close and so were all the children, so initially I thought it was a friendly thing and Tom and Cindy liked to tease each other often, so I don't judge. Then, as I'm reading the comments on this ""innocent picture"", my uncle comments, ""beautiful couple, very happy for you two""... My heart dropped. What had Tom done and plastered on Facebook?! He couldn't be that ridiculous, could he? I did more digging, Tom's wife Cindy had taken Tom and the kids to Disney for Christmas back in February, everything seemed... More normal then... But nothing wild. My mind was racing, Cindy had put that she was single on MOTHER'S DAY and had spent the day alone with the girls. I couldn't help but try to get to the bottom so I texted Cindy. I asked her if we could get coffee and catch up and she agreed. The day comes, we meet at Starbucks, because iykyk mocha latte🤤 She knows me very well and expected I wouldn't beat around the bush and I asked her WTF. She said, ""I know, I know. It's apparently been going on for a while and I found out before Disney, I just didn't say anything. We truly were better as friends."" She's so graceful. She tells me a ton of dirty deets about it then, drops a bombshell. They had rushed the divorces, for both marriages. Why, you may ask? BRIANNA'S PREGNANT WITH TOM'S CHILD. And everyone in my family was ELATED. Why? Because Tom told everyone Cindy cheated first, which is a lie, so it was fine, basically. Now, myself keeping in mind that my father did the same thing to my mother, no one got pregnant at their age thankfully, my grandfather did it to my grandmother, my uncle did it to Tom's mother, etc. They all cheat. I had already cut my father off this winter for different reasons, trust me they were good, so the extended family supporting Tom's affair seemed like the easiest choice. They're all gone from my life as of now and I do keep in touch with Cindy and the girls but I'm curious of your opinions, potatoes. AITA for disowning them all?

- Theming is off the charts. Feel transported. Pumped in Disney scent that mask the swamp smell is very pleasant. Bunnies hop through the resort all the time. It’s like being in an animated movie.
- Nighttime campfire s’mores and popcorn movies by the water are a nice touch. I like watching the illuminated floats.
- Rooms are exceptionally good quality for only 50% more than moderate hotels, but not 100% more like other luxury hotels. Walk in shower is very luxurious.
- Restaurants and quick service are really good. I personally like Roaring Fork for its iced coffee/breakfast platters and Geyser Point for burgers/cocktails by the water.
- Pools/hot tubs are wonderfully themed, uncrowded, and close to the rooms.
- Boat ride to Magic Kingdom is BOSS and the busses are never full and run frequently.
- Parking is never a problem.
- Love the well supplied gift/connivence shop 
Cons: I personally don’t like the food at Whispering Canyon Cafe and lack of monorail access.

Resorts I’ve stayed at: Grand Floridian, Pop Century, Coronado, and Port Orleans. Grand Flo was just overpriced even with the refurbished rooms (buildings are so spread out it’s a long walk everywhere which is a pain after walking 14 miles at the park). Pop Century food was gross and the busses were always packed (refurbished rooms look amazing/best value for just park&crash no question). Coronado was nice but the bus system is terrible. Port Orleans is probably the best price to feature ratio, but I personally don’t like the rooms or the theming.

I also don’t spend all day at the parks. I usually go mainly early morning/night and special nighttime ticketed events. So I do actually spend a lot of time at the resort chilling during the day.",31,1754234201.0,DisneyWorld,32,0.94,False

I installed Abiotic Factor yesterday, just to see if it was something I'd like, before I bought it (on Steam).  I played it on PS+ on my PS5 and loved it there, but I felt the controls were a bit cumbersome.  Long story short, I liked it sooooo much better on PC, I went ahead and bought the game.

Hey there! I’m based in downtown Sac and on the hunt for some new female friends to hang with. I feel like I never fully bounced back socially after the pandemic and I’m seriously craving some solid girl time.

I frequent the gym, fitness classes, and love a good walk around the grid. I’m also a big foodie and always down to check out new restaurants or coffee chops or just hang and chill.

When I’m not out and about, I’m either taking quick day trips to the beach, lounging at a local park, or getting cozy at home with my cats watching horror/thriller/true crime flicks. I also love catching local punk shows when they pop up.

If any of that sounds like your vibe, I’d love to connect and hang sometime!

1mglq7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1mglq7g/epic_8day_trip/,Epic 8-day trip,"Just got back from a  8 day holiday and it was incredible despite a few hiccups. Let’s get the inconveniences out of the way first:

1.	⁠Buying and recharging a SIM card was incredibly difficult And I struggle to understand why it was so. We bought a Liberty sim card from a supermarket in San Jose. The Sim card had to be activated by calling the helpline and this process took around one hour with details of the hotel I was staying at, my passport number, name, address, email ID sought by the executive. It also took a lot of time to be connected to an executive who spoke English. Mind you, the struggle was only to have the SIM card activated. The process of recharge was even more complicated as I could not download the Liberty app (not available on App Store) and as no one seemed to be able to tell me how much I should recharge for at the supermarkets. I went without Internet the first day and and got connected to Wi-Fi to understand how much I should recharge and to convey that to the supermarket. Not sure what I missed here but the recharge process is the most complicated I have ever come across in my life.

2.	⁠My husband‘s wallet got stolen at playa Hermosa and the bank cards were used by the thieves across what seems like supermarkets in Guanacaste. It took us four visits to the police station to get the Complaint registered.

These were the Only hiccups in what was otherwise a fantastic trip and this is what itinerary looked like:

•	⁠Arrived in San Jose late at night, picked up the rental car and checked into the hotel Doubletree by Hilton Cariari just because of its location close to the airport. I wanted to rest before driving next morning. Decent hotel.

•	⁠Drove to MonteVerde and stayed there for 2 nights

Started with a coffee tour at Café MonteVerde farms. They also organised lunch at an additional cost which was convenient for us. Lunch itself was probably one of the best I had during my trip and the coffee tour was great. The Guide spoke about the innovation being carried out at the farms and less about the process of farming the coffee itself. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the tour as the guide’s passion came across very strongly. The coffee was delicious too.

Checked into our hotel El Establo and signed up for the night walk organised by them . The guide again was quite good although I feel the night walk can be offered at a lower price. The hotel is a large commercial one. What the room lacked in basic amenities such as a kettle and iron board; it made up in fantastic views of the cloud forest. I love the swimming pool in this hotel as it had epic sunset views.

The next day we visited the Santa Elena reserve on a guided tour and really enjoyed our visit. One member of the group also did zip lining at the hotel itself and enjoyed it. Monteverde reminded me of a sleepy hill stations in India; cute and compact. I quite liked the vibe.

Restaurants we ate at: Taco Taco (very good), Stella’s (great breakfast), Morphos (great views but the food was disappointing), San Lucas treetop dining experience (nice but not worth the money. I would suggest keeping this and going to Don Rufino in La Fortuna instead.), Orchids (great coffee, decent food)

•	⁠We drove to playa Hermosa the next day. We did this because members of our group had their return flight from the Guanacaste airport. We stayed at El Velero for 2 nights. This was my least favourite accommodation in Costa Rica. I felt catfished as the hotel did not look as nice as it did in the photos online. Our room was a bit stuffy and the bathroom was actually a bit dirty. We visited playa Del Coco and playa Hermosa. The beaches itself were nice and we enjoyed the experience of having local snacks by the beach such as the mango with the lime and chilli, the meat on the stick and the fresh coconuts. However, I would not say this is an unskippable experience. I would rather visit the white sand beaches on the Caribbean side.

Restaurants we ate at:  Ginger (good food but small portions and expensive), Roberto’s (liked the cocktails but the food was too oily), Naans & curries (great Indian food).

•	⁠we then headed to La Fortuna for 3 nights and this was our favourite bit of the trip.

En route from Monte Verde to La Fortuna we did the tubing tour at Rio Celeste organised by Onca tours. This was a highlight of my trip. The tubing was great fun although the river was not blue at the time we visited. I spotted a sloth while on the tour.

We checked into Tifakara Boutique hotel at La Fortuna and loved every bit of our stay there. It is a lovely little hotel with immaculate hospitality, the cutest rooms in the most magical setting, great breakfast and pool side snacks. We saw epic frogs on the complementary Nightwalk organised by the hotel. Kevin was a great guide.

We did zip lining at Sky adventures, visited the La fortuna waterfall, went to Eco Termales for the hot springs, did a birdwatching tour at Arenal observatory lodge with Richard who recommended by this sub-Reddit. All these were fantastic experiences.

What I enjoyed less was the combined tour of  Arenal volcano and the hanging bridges at Mistico. The provider use by the hotel was not great. There was a lot of standing around throughout the tour and the guides were not great. I would recommend visiting these sites with guides researched independently.

I love La Fortuna with views of the volcano everywhere you look and the great food scene. It is much bigger compared to Monte Verde and has more activities to offer. I would recommend staying at La Fortuna with a day trip to Monte Verde.

Restaurants, we ate at: Don Rufino (the best dinner we had in Costa Rica, although quite expensive but fully worth it ), Tiquicia (nice food and lovely staff), Chante verde (decent but expensive for what you’re getting)

•	⁠Drove back to San Jose and stayed the night at country Inn by Radisson before flying out. Decent hotel again.

I loved loved Costa Rica and can’t visit to visit again. Many thanks to this group for all the tips and help in planning my trip. Hit me up with any questions that you have.",2,1754234000.0,CostaRicaTravel,2,1.0,False

My little family (my husband, me, and my son) is relocating to OC for my husband's new job. *(We lived here from 2016-2018 and loved it)*.

  
We've been doing all the regular things to find a place but a friend suggested that I post here in case someone local was looking to rent and doesn't use Zillow or the apps.

  
We're looking for a 2-bedroom, 1.5 bath (2 baths would be amazing but we would also consider 1) that has in-unit laundry, a small garage, and a small yard (if it's a house or townhouse). If we have a house with a yard then we could do smaller square footage but if we're in a condo or apartment we'd like at least 900 square feet. We're also open to other options if it's the right fit for us. We want to stay under $2,800 a month if possible, but we can stretch the budget for the perfect fit.

  
Locations: We'd love to be in either Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Tustin, Mission Viejo, Irvine, Aliso Viejo, or something near these locations. Walkability to parks or coffee shops would be great too.

  
A little bit about us: We've had incredible relationships with all of our landlords so far. We treat every place we live as if it's truly ours and take pride in taking care of our space. We live a healthy lifestyle that centers around giving our son the best childhood possible while having fun ourselves. My husband works in corporate, and I have my own small online social media business.

1mglnds,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1mglnds/my_last_letter_to_you/,My last letter to you,"Time is dragging but flying, and I don’t know how to explain it. I think back to days and nights when we were “us,” it was so long ago. The last time I saw you and you couldn’t even look at me, it hurt so badly, it’s why I couldn’t stay in the house with you.  Again, time is slipping away so fast but the void of you missing from my life makes it drag. 


I was going through pictures and saw my sneaky screenshots of us laughing on our late-night calls. We laughed so much, it was a good time, you were my lightness. You turned me on so much too and we were just getting started on our exploration.  I still get angry at the timing, if only we waited a little longer or pushed through a little harder.. if only. 


I still hate that you gave up on us so easily. I know it was me too, but I guess it proves it wasn’t love.  Remember the movie “the Mexican?” The line: “When do you give up on love when it just doesn’t work?”  The answer is never.  I guess it’s just a movie, yet still I write to you. I still have your poetry and your words; it meant something, you meant something.


I did let you all the way in, but I feel like you had one foot out the door for so long, protective mode, maybe, or it finally clicked I was too much for you, I was right that I’m crazy and you couldn’t handle me.  I guess I’ll never know and that’s ok, it’s better I found out now than down the road. 


I’ve been dating, but I hate it. The apps are crazy, gross, and overwhelming. I X’d out over 1000 profiles last week but have been on a few dates. The kids even know and they mock me but I laugh it off with them.  I’m not in hiding anymore, not since he’s in love with someone else and I’m free.  


God, it feels so good to be free.


I heard our kids talking last night and pictured you watching a show in your plaid pajamas or wining and dining a new girl.  One who’s truly confident and independent (but boring AF). Yes, I’m still a brat haha 


The horses came yesterday, and I wanted to text you pictures and videos. Mr. “Irish Goodbye” and his crazy partner still ask about you—they liked you. I’ve told them it’s over at least ten times. My mother actually is siding with you, saying she doesn’t blame you. Ha. 


Oh while you’re not here reading this; when my friend wanted to meet at our old coffee shop, I wanted to die. When there were no spots except in front of your work, I almost left. What was I supposed to say? “No, I can’t go there, he’ll think I’m stalking him”? Lol, God has a sense of humor. She picked the spot; I have texts to prove it. I pray you remembered that was her and my spot. I think I told you, but I know your memory.


Today, they leave me, and it always makes me sad. It makes me miss you, miss the excitement of us meeting in person so long ago, when time was dragging with anticipation, thrill, and lust, not this new unknown dread of new people, fear, and zero spark..


I am starting to get close to someone. You’d be happy to know he’s very kind, empathetic and tolerant to a whole new level.   He’s also a Dad so he gets it, and my age so maybe that helps… Nothing physical has happened, I can’t yet, I still feel badly about myself after us; since you’ve been gone I regret it.  I wanted my next to be special and since you’ve been gone I feel like I was just the thrill, conquest, etc..  now it will be guarded stronger, the next who gets to take me. 


I still wish you missed me and would come back. I wish it so much because I just needed a little more time to level out. Your last words, “feels different now I’ve never seen that side of you before,” always reminds me you won’t and it’s how I move on.  


Maybe I’m fantasizing you’ll think of me come here and read this with a smile, remembering me in a good light. Maybe I’m writing for my own closure, knowing I’ll never hear from you about us. Maybe I’m writing this as my last unsent letter you, knowing the next one will be for someone else.  I don’t know and I’ve grown back to compartmentalizing so I’m tucking the maybes away. 


I’ll always be sorry for the turmoil I caused in your life. I hope the connection we shared and the fire we lit with our spark was worth it to you. It was to me.

I am 32M, single, grew up in Kolkata, currently living in Bangalore. I studied Physics (till masters), then switched to MBA and am now working in a startup.

Personality type: INTJ-A

I have many reasons for being childfree. The top three would be:

1. I don't think the next generation will have better lives than ours.
2. I wish to retire early and pursue passion projects that may not be financially rewarding. Having dependent kids will massively delay such plans.
3. I like peace, quiet and flexibility. I don't want to deal with the hassle of raising a child.

Life has been kind to me overall. I have a good career, a (mostly) supportive family, and no major source of stress. As I grow older, I crave a slower and more intentional life. I take time brewing my morning coffee in a moka pot. I journal everyday with nice fountain pens and inks. I spend a lot of time on my balcony which is peaceful and overlooks a lake.

I’m passionate about photography, art, reading, writing, science, wildlife, music, coffee, chess, fountain pens... the list can go on. Despite all that, my work consumes a majority my time as of now. Luckily, I love my work most of the time.

**What I am looking for**

* A CF penpal to exchange letters on our lives, philosophies, hobbies, work, and anything under the sun.
* While a strong CF stance is a must, I don't want our friendship to revolve around just that.
* Key traits I admire in fellow humans: open-mindedness, kindness, nerdiness/depth, passion for diverse things
* Should value rationality: someone atheist or agnostic, and doesn't condone pseudosciences  such as homeopathy, astrology etc.
* Someone around my age (28-36)
* All genders are welcome
* Not looking for romance

Addressing some additional questions below.

**What is a penpal?**

A penpalship is a friendship between two people who communicate primarily via letters/emails. These are usually people who haven't met each other and don't use any medium of real time communication channel such as social media/IMs/calls/etc. The slowness of the exchange encourages deeper reflection and longer messages. Typically it would involve one letter/email weekly or monthly.

**Why am I looking for a penpal on this subreddit?**

There's a subreddit dedicated to finding penpals (r/penpals), but it is dominated by Americans. I have found some nice penpals there. I am currently looking for a penpal who is going through the CF experience in India, for which I felt this sub is more suitable.

Many of my friends have gotten married and have kids. This naturally brings in some degree of disconnect, as their lives are becoming very different from mine. I am looking forward to building new, long term CF friendships whose lives may feel more relatable to me, especially as we age.

# Best candle Matches 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Candle matches,frequently enough overlooked,are a crucial accessory for candle enthusiasts. They provide a safe and elegant way to ignite your favorite scents, enhancing the overall ambiance of your space. Choosing the right candle matches can elevate the experience from a simple functional task to a ritualistic and aesthetically pleasing part of your candle enjoyment. This guide will explore the best candle matches available in 2025, highlighting their features, benefits, and providing recommendations to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features analysis

The best candle matches offer a combination of length, material, strike surface quality, and aesthetic design. Each of these features contributes to a positive and safe user experience.

**Match Length:** Match length is crucial as it determines how far your hand is from the flame when lighting a candle.Longer matches are especially useful for lighting candles deep inside jars or those with multiple wicks.

Longer matches provide a safer and more convenient experience. They reduce the risk of burning your fingers and allow you to reach wicks that are positioned deep within candle containers. The ideal length ranges from 4 to 11 inches, offering ample reach without being unwieldy.

**Match Material:** The material of the matchstick itself contributes to its burn quality and overall safety. Quality matches are made from wood that is treated for consistent and clean burning.Look for matches crafted from high-quality wood, such as pine or aspen, that have been properly treated to ensure a clean and even burn. The wood should be free from splinters and knots, and the match head should be securely attached to prevent breakage. A robust match material minimizes the risk of snapping during striking, which can be both frustrating and perhaps perilous.

**Strike Surface Quality:** The strike surface is critical for reliable ignition. High-quality strike surfaces provide consistent friction,ensuring that the match lights quickly and easily every time.

A well-made strike surface is essential for effortless lighting. It should be durable,evenly coated with the appropriate striking compound,and resistant to wear and tear. Consider matches packaged with strike surfaces that are integrated into the container or designed for long-term use. This ensures that the matches remain functional throughout their lifespan.

**Container design:** The container that holds the matches not only serves a practical purpose by keeping them organized and protected,but also contributes to the overall aesthetic appeal.

A well-designed container enhances the user experience. Look for options with secure closures to prevent accidental spills, durable materials to withstand everyday use, and visually appealing designs that complement your home decor. Some premium matches are housed in decorative glass jars or elegant wooden boxes, adding a touch of sophistication to your candle setup.

**Safety Features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with fire. Quality candle matches should include safety measures to prevent accidental ignition and ensure safe handling.

Features such as child-resistant packaging, safety coatings on the match heads, and clear instructions for use contribute to a safer experience. Always store matches in a cool, dry place away from heat sources and flammable materials. Proper handling and storage are essential to prevent accidents.

**Quantity:** The number of matches included in a package is a meaningful factor, especially for avid candle users.

Consider the quantity of matches in relation to your usage frequency and the overall value. Bulk packs offer cost savings for frequent candle burners, while smaller quantities might potentially be suitable for occasional use. Ensure that the matches are adequately protected to prevent damage or deterioration during storage.

## Core Benefits

High-quality candle matches offer several advantages over standard lighters or less carefully made matches, enhancing the candle-lighting experience for both convenience and safety.

**Enhanced Safety:** Longer match sticks keep fingers further away from the flame, reducing the risk of burns. Sturdy construction prevents the matchstick from snapping during ignition, minimizing the chance of scattering embers.A well-designed match prioritizes safety, providing users with peace of mind while enjoying their candles. This is especially critically important for those with children or pets, where minimizing fire hazards is crucial. by choosing matches with robust safety features, users can confidently create a relaxing ambiance without unnecessary risks.

**Improved Lighting Performance:** High-quality strike surfaces ensure consistent and reliable ignition. Well-treated wood allows for a clean, even burn, preventing sputtering or flare-ups that can damage candles or surrounding surfaces.Reliable lighting performance is a key benefit of premium candle matches. With a consistent and clean burn, these matches not only ignite candles effectively but also contribute to the overall enjoyment of the experience. No one wants to struggle with multiple attempts to light a candle, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.

**Elevated Aesthetic:** Stylish containers enhance the visual appeal of candle displays. Coordinated designs complement various home decor styles, adding a touch of elegance to any space.

Beyond functionality, premium candle matches serve as a decorative accessory. The attractive packaging and thoughtful design can elevate the overall aesthetic of your candle display, creating a cohesive and stylish ambiance. Whether displayed on a coffee table or mantelpiece, these matches add a touch of sophistication to any room.

**Increased Convenience:** Longer matches make it easier to light candles in hard-to-reach places, such as deep jars or multi-wick candles. Secure containers prevent spills and keep matches organized, ensuring they are always readily accessible.

Convenience is another significant benefit. No more struggling to reach the wick with a lighter or fumbling with a flimsy matchbox. These matches are designed for ease of use, making the candle-lighting ritual a seamless and enjoyable part of your routine.

**Consistent Burning:** The use of high-quality wood ensures a steady flame that doesn't extinguish prematurely. This is especially helpful for outdoor settings where wind can be a factor.

Consistent burning is essential for a hassle-free candle-lighting experience. High-quality matches provide a steady flame that stays lit long enough to ignite the candle wick effectively. This reliability is notably valuable when lighting candles outdoors or in drafty environments, where a weaker flame might easily be extinguished.

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal length for candle matches?**
The ideal length for candle matches typically ranges from 4 to 11 inches. Longer matches are beneficial for lighting candles in deep jars or those with multiple wicks, as they keep your hand safely away from the flame. shorter matches may suffice for candles with easily accessible wicks, but prioritize safety and convenience.

**How should I store my candle matches to keep them in good condition?**
Store candle matches in a cool,dry place away from heat sources and direct sunlight. Humidity and heat can degrade the striking surface and effect the matches' ability to ignite. Keep them in their original container or a dedicated match holder with a secure lid to prevent accidental ignition and protect them from moisture.**Are there environmentally amiable options for candle matches?**
Yes, there are several environmentally friendly options available. Look for matches made from sustainably sourced wood and packaged in recyclable or biodegradable materials. Some manufacturers also offer refillable match containers to reduce waste. Consider matches with strike surfaces made from eco-friendly compounds for a more sustainable choice.

**Can I travel with candle matches on an airplane?**
Regulations regarding traveling with matches vary by airline and destination. In general, safety matches are permitted in carry-on luggage, but strike-anywhere matches are frequently enough prohibited. Check with your airline or the relevant aviation authority before traveling to ensure compliance with their specific rules. It is indeed always best to err on the side of caution and pack matches in your carry-on to avoid potential issues.

It has a strong history in the area and is located in a great area. College town, main street, Sells coffee, pastries, and wine. Has a kitchen that is not currently being utilized. I am just starting to look deeper into this but the numbers that have been thrown out seem acceptable, of course, I will be reviewing the actual financials to make my decision. 

What I am asking is what are the chances that an established business tanks right after I purchase it? I don't plan on changing the business at the start since it is an established name and seems to be profitable. I have no doubt in my ability to run the operations as I have experience in the food service industry. I have a strong support team. My doubt is that I have not had a lot of time to research this industry to know if there is a trend towards these businesses losing their customer base due to economic reasons. I understand that inventory costs have probably been increasing and so are labor costs, but I really am not looking to become wealthy from this venture just run the business and pull a little income from it.  Any insight that someone can give me would be appreciated. ",1,1754233566.0,smallbusiness,4,1.0,False

1mgliq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1mgliq1/does_the_tozo_a2_mini_wireless_earbuds_deliver/,Does the TOZO A2 Mini Wireless Earbuds Deliver Top Sound Quality?,"The TOZO A2 Mini Wireless Earbuds have been a part of my daily grind for the past month, and although they’ve definitely impressed me, there are some quirks worth sharing. TOZO’s reputation for creating affordable but feature-packed earbuds seems intact with this release, but let me tell you how they stacked up during my personal experience.

**Compact Design and Comfortable Fit**

If you're a fan of lightweight, barely-there earbuds, these might just be your dream pair. Each earbud is an almost unnoticeable 3.7 grams, so they don’t feel heavy or intrusive when worn for extended periods. The ergonomic design worked well for my smaller ears, and they stayed firmly in place even during workouts or my brisk morning jogs through the park. My teenage cousin with differently-sized ear canals also found them incredibly comfortable, thanks to the variety of eartip sizes included. However, the minimalist look doesn’t scream high-end, but for the price range, I can’t complain too much.

**Stereo Sound Quality That Surprises**

I took these earbuds on a sonic adventure through different genres, from heavy bass EDM tracks to soft acoustic ballads. The 6mm dynamic drivers are a pleasant surprise, delivering clear highs and punchy bass without overpowering the midrange. They don’t rival premium earbuds like the Sennheiser Momentum or Sony WF series, but the audio depth is fantastic for casual listening. One thing I noticed, though, is that the bass can sometimes overwhelm when turning up the volume, occasionally clouding the mids. Audiophiles might pick up on this, but for the average listener like me, it delivers a good balance at moderate volume levels.

**Smart Touch Controls for On-the-Go Users**

The touch controls were a walk in the park to set up. I used them to adjust the volume, skip tracks, pause playback, and even activate the voice assistant while walking through the city with a coffee in one hand and my dog’s leash in the other. They’re responsive 98% of the time, but sometimes, especially with sweaty fingers after a workout, commands failed to register. You need to be deliberate with each tap, which took some time to get used to in the beginning.

**Impeccable Bluetooth 5.3 Connectivity**

The Bluetooth 5.3 technology isn’t just shiny marketing jargon. The connection remained flawless from my bedroom to the kitchen, even with two walls in between, which is impressive within the promised 12-meter range. Pairing them with my devices was basically idiot-proof—they connected to my Android phone and laptop in seconds. I even used them during a Zoom meeting, and the seamless performance left me impressed.

**Boons**

- Ergonomic and lightweight design that’s great for all-day wear
- Clear stereo audio with pleasing bass and treble balance
- Intuitive touch controls for effortless functionality
- Stable and long-range Bluetooth 5.3 connection

**Hurdles**

- Occasionally overpowering bass at higher volumes
- Touch controls may falter when fingers are wet or sweaty

**Product Competitors**

When comparing these earbuds, my immediate thought went to the Anker Soundcore Life P2 and the JBL Tune 125TWS. The Anker model offers a slightly better bass tuning but lacks the compact, featherlight design of the TOZO A2. The JBL earbuds, on the other hand, felt slightly more premium in build but fell short on battery life. Neither competitor matched the TOZO A2’s sleek comfort and reliable Bluetooth connection. However, devices like the Soundcore Liberty Air 2, priced slightly higher, do offer more refined sound customization and better noise isolation—something the TOZO A2 could improve.

**Affordable Quality**

One of the biggest drawcards of these earbuds is their financial accessibility. Comparing them to other models in their category, these genuinely feel like a steal. Every dollar spent translates to fulfilling sound performance, convenience, and dependable connectivity. Would I recommend them? Absolutely, especially if you’re on a tighter budget and need earbuds that perform solidly without pretensions of being luxury tech.

1mglifg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1mglifg/moms_only_54_and_8_days_from_being_homeless/,Mom's only 54 and 8 days from being homeless.,"I'm sorry in advance for how long this will be but I  mostly just need to vent and maybe some reassurance that I'm not a monster!

My mom is 54 years old and is in shape. other than some chronic bronchitis due to constant chainsmoking, pre diabetes and a throid condition( which she has medicine for) she's in relatively good health and fit. My problem is she moved about an hour away from me in 2021 and hasn't been able to hold a job for more than 2 to 3 months since. She causes drama with the employees or just stops showing up. Regardless it's never her fault she always has stories and lies where she's the victim despite the fact that we're talking about 11 different jobs there's no way she was the victim in all of them!

 Financially she's never been good with money we were homeless growing up a few times.  She cashed in her 401K early and her retirement and left a solid union job. To be closer to one of my siblings that has children because the other sibling with a kid wouldn't let her have unlimited access and no rules for her grandkid. She bought a house that was a scam house in cash and waved the inspection. Long story short before she finished paying it off she spent all the cash she had and then couldn't pay it off so even though it was not up to code the original owner ended up being able to take it back anyway because she couldn't finish paying what she agreed to pay and basically she lost everything. 

Over the years she had a tendency to triangulate and separate my siblings so we didn't communicate very well and we were generally angry at each other. This past year we came together because we realized that our mother was constantly asking each one of us for money and lying to us. Since she moved up here I've probably given her 4000-5000 just to bail her out of all of her mistakes. ( not paying rent, letting her bank account go several hundred dollars in the negative, needing food and gas ect) As well as my other siblings. She stole over 7000 from one of them who is autistic. 

My point is she's not a very good person and won't hold a job because she will just stop showing up because she doesn't think she should work and in her mind she's too old to work but not too old for anything else. 

Everything came to a head this last month because we found out she is about to be evicted she owes the landlord almost $3,000 she also lost her electricity because she just hasn't been paying it.  she owes them about $1,000. We've told her in the past when we have all had to pull money together to bail her out that she needs to let us know before it gets this bad. It's a lot easier to help with a $900 rent than it is to help with $3,000 in back rent. Her response to that is all of us kids should be calling her to ask if she needs money or needs food or needs anything. Mind you she has never once asked how we were doing or helped any of us with our problems. 

Also it's worth mentioning she has one of those scam online boyfriends who she can only talk to Via an app and she has been sending him money  since January she won't tell us how much. She also won't listen to us when we tell her it's a scam.

She has eight days before the cops remove her from the house she hasn't packed a single box or looked for a new place. One of my sisters was going to let my mom move in with her . However she never told Mom that and then my mom went around bashing her . saying how no one has ever helped her with anything . So my sister decided to just let her sink and went no contact. Mom has found a new job but it starts in 2 weeks. She sold everything she could possibly sell including my autistic siblings gaming system which is literally his entire world.

 Me and my siblings all decided that we're not going to save her this time. She won't listen to us she constantly says she's the parent and doesn't have to listen to her children Etc. So we all have  blocked her and have stopped communication. She's basically going nuclear now because she fully expected one of us to let her live with us but we are all refusing. 

I am struggling because I won't help her financially. On top of that she has no electricity when we have  massive heat waves passing through and it has been  insanely hot she has no air conditioning.

 I felt really bad and wanted to go ahead and pay her electricity but then I found out she was doordashing coffee and spending her money on stupid stuff like that. I also found out she got a couple hundred dollars from a charity and didn't spend it on her electricity. She won't tell us what she spent it on but we all suspect it went to her online(scam) boyfriend. Am I a monster for letting my mom be homeless? I know if she moves in she will never move out or work she will just mooch and while I could technically afford to house her it wouldn't be easy by any means. Also am I a monster for not offering my mom to stay with me when she had no air conditioning during 90° weather? 

It's this much of a struggle and she's only 54! It breaks my heart that she might be homeless but I just can't do this anymore.

It's a long story but I have this extra ticket of Demon Slayer Infinity Castle during Aug 12th/13th super late night at KL.

Any single non-muslim female in 20s here looking to mingle or have a casual fun movie outing with an average looking brown guy? 😬

I know the timing is not ideal (late night and on weekday) but if you're down (into anime), single and average looking at least then we could meetup for coffee first over the coming weekend or sometime after work (important for both to get to know each other little bit first).

If it goes well then we can watch the movie together. Maybe even do more cool/fun things in future if the vibe/chemistry is there (also cool with having another female friend).

If you could share/DM some info about yourself or a picture (only if you're okay) that would be helpful. I'm a guy in early 30s and looking for either casual fun dates or potential long term partner.

I have a car so I can also pick you up and send you home after the movie if need to.



For context:
Friend A bought extra set of 2 tix for their partner during both of those dates, so I bought the extra set from friend A to watch with friend B.

Originally planned to go with friend B but he said it was too late for him. So now I have a free tix to use. Rather go either with a close friend or a date, hence why I'm here.


PS:
In case someone mentions abt dating apps, I'm rarely on dating apps and I'm just an average guy, so it won't be easy to find leads there. I also created an acc earlier so I'm still gathering leads. In case I have no partner in the end, it's fine for me. I'm used to watching movies by myself, but I figured maybe I shouldn't keep doing this.",1,1754233390.0,Bolehland,5,0.6,False

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this question, but I hope someone here can help. I purchased a gorgeous mid century, original wood credenza, only to discover after it was delivered that the inside smells terrible…like incredibly strong perfume. According to the person I bought it from, it was owned by one person for 60+ years, and it smells like it 🫠 (she also said it didn’t smell when she had it but I don’t see how that’s possible). 

I’ve tried everything that’s been suggested on the internet to remove/block the odor: white vinegar, baking soda, coffee grounds, airing it out, industrial strength odor elimination spray, and 3 coats of shellac, but nothing has gotten rid of it. The shellac helped a little but it’s still way too potent to use it.

Is there anything else I should try before completely giving up and selling it? More shellac? Odor blocking primer? I’m open to any and all suggestions. TIA!",1,1754233226.0,fixit,0,1.0,False
1mgldrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mgldrd/failing_to_make_struggling_wife_feel_loved/,Failing to Make Struggling Wife Feel Loved,"Both late 40s, married 20 years. Not the smoothest of marriages. No kids.

My wife is really struggling. She feels overwhelmed by work, though she is very good at it and makes very good money. (She's hated every job she's had since I've known her, but is always an exceptionally hard worker). She can't quit as she makes about 55% of our income and we'd need to radically downgrade our lifestyle--something we've discussed and she isn't interested in. She also has chronic pain and is going through menopause. She's just miserable. I think, too, she has very real mental health issues and probably would benefit from meds if she got a proper diagnosis. She's made it abundantly clear in the past she has no interest in that.

She told me this morning that I am a terrible husband. She feels she does all the mental labor.

I let her vent about work and whatever daily, but she resents that my job (full-time and with a hefty commute) is easier than hers. (It is.) We never talk about my day. Chores wise I do the most of the cleaning (including meal clean up), yard work, anything car related, finances, and laundry. She does most of the cooking and shopping. I try to cuddle her and comfort her and she just pulls away or sits there passively.

She taken to insulting me and yelling at me saying that's the only way to get my attention and snap me out of my not helping her. Today she got very upset, cancelled our plans and told me she didn't love me. The cause was she got up earlier than me (6:30 vs 7;15), made breakfast and got stuff ready for our outing. (If I do this, she gets upset that I'm rushing her and not letting her sleep in). She told me I was like a pet in that I get up instinctively when breakfast is ready and then got mad that as she was handing me a cup of coffee I pointed out two lovely birds on our patio rather than thanking her for breakfast. (I regularly thank her if she cooks. I think it goes in one ear and out the other most of the time).

I think this was spill-over from yesterday when I commented I was surprised she ate a whole sub we had ordered and that she must have been very hungry. (She usually eats half). She took this to be me calling her fat. (I never comment on her weight).

She works from home and feels trapped. Because she's a great cook and at home she cooks most of the dinners.  I think I need to start cooking more--maybe shifting my hours earlier so I get home earlier so she isn't overly hungry waiting for me to make dinner if I do. We spent a lot of time together in the evenings and weekends.

I suppose I could try to shower her with love. Flowers, repeated verbal praise, massages (though I had massaging her as she always criticizes me and says I'm not as good as a professional). I think she'd like me to plan a lot more in terms of dates, but she researches restaurants when she can't sleep and night and usually rejects my suggestions as not good enough. That she only has time for the best restaurants.

I find it very hard to love on someone when it isn't reciprocated. I find it hard to listen to the same complaints about work every day.

She doesn't have much of a support network. She's totally estranged from her family and has steadily reduced our network of friends. She hates my family. She's got two local friends--both of whom she complains about and one across the country who she likes a lot but who she thinks is messing up her (the friend's) life. She generally doesn't like my friends, not that I spend much time with them anyway.

The thing is I know from past relationships that I can fail to make people feel loved. (I also know past relationships I'm drawn to women with mental health issues). I don't make them feel special. It's not that I'm cruel or don't do my fair share, it's just I let life go on and like a a quiet, routine life. I like to relax.

My wife feels if I don't have gifts bought a month in advance that I don't care. That if I don't plan out meals days in advance that I'm not thinking of her. That if I don't figure out where we are going to eat out on vacation ahead of time that I'm making her do all the planning. That if I don't tell her on Wednesday that I'm planning to do X,Y, and Z around the house over the weekend, that she has to remind me to do those things and do all of the mental labor even though I fully intend to do work around the house.

I don't know how to be the person she wants me to be and I don't know how to convince her to get professional help. She tells me I'm stupid, a bad husband, lazy, unthinking, and that she doesn't love me, I make her life worse, and wants to get away from me. I've told her if she truly believes all that we need to get divorced. Yet, apparently she doesn't want a divorce.

I feel totally defeated, beat down, and guilty all at once. I've failed.

Turns out, getting the data was easy… making it usable was the real challenge.

The dataset I scraped was a mess:

* Missing values in random places
* Duplicate entries from multiple runs
* Dates in all kinds of formats
* Prices stored as strings, sometimes even spelled out in words (“twenty”)

After a few hours of trial, error, and too much coffee, I leaned on Pandas to fix things up. Here’s what helped me:

1. Handling Missing Values

I didn’t want to drop everything blindly, so I selectively removed or filled gaps.

    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_csv(""scraped_data.csv"")
    
    # Drop rows where all values are missing
    df_clean = df.dropna(how='all')
    
    # Fill known gaps with a placeholder
    df_filled = df.fillna(""N/A"")

2. Removing Duplicates

Running the scraper multiple times gave me repeated rows. Pandas made this part painless:

    df_unique = df.drop_duplicates()

3. Standardizing Formats

This step saved me from endless downstream errors:

    # Normalize text
    df['product_name'] = df['product_name'].str.lower()
    
    # Convert dates safely
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce')
    
    # Convert price to numeric
    df['price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['price'], errors='coerce')

4. Filtering the Noise

I removed data that didn’t matter for my analysis:

    # Drop columns if they exist
    df = df.drop(columns=['unnecessary_column'], errors='ignore')
    
    # Keep only items above a certain price
    df_filtered = df[df['price'] > 10]
    

5. Quick Insights

Once the data was clean, I could finally do something useful:

    avg_price = df_filtered.groupby('category')['price'].mean()
    print(avg_price)
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    df_filtered['price'].plot(kind='hist', bins=20, title='Price Distribution')
    plt.xlabel(""Price"")
    plt.show()

  
What I Learned:

* Scraping is the “easy” part; cleaning takes way longer than expected.
* Pandas can solve 80% of the mess with just a few well-chosen functions.
* Adding `errors='coerce'` prevents a lot of headaches when parsing inconsistent data.
* If you’re just starting, I recommend reading a tutorial on cleaning scraped data with Pandas (the one I followed is [here](https://crawlbase.com/blog/how-to-use-python-pandas-to-analyze-data/) – super beginner-friendly).

I’d love to hear how other Python devs handle chaotic scraped data. Any neat tricks for weird price strings or mixed date formats? I’m still learning and could use better strategies for my next project.",3,1754233110.0,Python,1,0.62,False

Then Left a $0 Tip,"I (19F) am a full-time nursing student and part-time waitress. It’s not glamorous, but it’s how I afford tuition, rent, gas, and cheap coffee to keep from passing out between classes and shifts. I'm tired, always broke, and trying my best.

This morning I had a Sunday brunch shift aka, the Hunger Games in apron form. I’m already running on four hours of sleep and half a granola bar. Then she walks in. Mid-50s, Chanel bag, energy that could freeze boiling water. I greet her with my usual, “Hi! Welcome in! How are you today?”

She cuts me off with: “Coffee. Black. Don’t talk to me like we’re friends.”  
Okay. Got it. She’s one of those.

I bring the coffee, and she starts picking me apart like I’m a character flaw.  
“This table’s crooked.”  
“My toast is too hard.”  
“Why are your shoes dirty?” (Because I walk 10,000 steps a shift, ma’am.)

Then came the line that broke me.  
After I brought her eggs (for the third time, because the first two weren’t “sunny” enough), she looks me dead in the eyes and says:

“Is this really the best you can do? No wonder you’re just a waitress.”

My hands were literally shaking. I didn’t even know what to say. I just stood there, frozen, blinking fast to keep the tears in. And then she smiled. Not kindly like she was satisfied. Like she’d won.

When she was done, she scribbled $0.00 on the tip line, stared at me one last time, and walked out like she hadn’t just kicked someone while they were down.

My manager? Just shrugged and said, “Some customers are difficult. Let it go.”  
But I couldn’t. Not really. I went into the walk in freezer and cried like someone had flipped a switch. Quiet, ugly sobs while frozen peas dug into my back.

What she doesn’t know is that I worked until 2 a.m. last night. That I studied during my 10 minute break. That I’m trying. That this isn’t just a job it’s survival.

And the worst part? I still had to smile and take the next table like nothing happened.

So to that woman:  
You didn’t break me, but you made today a whole lot harder than it needed to be.  
And to the older man at Table 9 who saw my red eyes and left a $10 tip with the words “Hang in there” you’ll never know how much that meant.

This job isn’t easy. Life isn’t easy. But I’m still here, still trying. Even if no one tips.

The memory-leak targets the intimate daily practice millions depend on.. Their meditation routine.. Revealing how their most sacred spiritual activity serves the exact system it claims to transcend. It dismantles the narrative that meditation leads to liberation, exposing it as sophisticated mental conditioning that creates compliant and psychotic rather than so-called enlightened beings.

This hits particularly close to home because it attacks the one practice people trust as authentically transformative, revealing it as another form of the control system disguised as resistance to control. The spiritual materialism critique is especially devastating because it shows how even the rejection of materialism becomes another form of materialism.

# The Sacred Delusion

You believe meditation is awakening. You've been told it's ancient wisdom, consciousness expansion, the path to inner peace and spiritual liberation. But what if your daily meditation practice is just sophisticated mental masturbation.. A feel-good activity that simulates enlightenment while ensuring you never actually wake up?

Meditation isn't meditation. It's pacification disguised as practice. The $9+ billion mindfulness industry didn't preserve ancient wisdom.. It weaponized contemplative techniques to create compliant consumers who mistake a fake inner calm for outer awareness. The ones participating in meditation are often the most neurotic ones.

1mglbjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/furniturerestoration/comments/1mglbjb/need_help_removing_strong_odor/,Need help removing strong odor,"Hello! I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this question, but I hope someone here can help. I purchased a gorgeous mid century, original wood credenza, only to discover after it was delivered that the inside smells terrible…like incredibly strong perfume. According to the person I bought it from, it was owned by one person for 60+ years, and it smells like it 🫠 (she also said it didn’t smell when she had it but I don’t see how that’s possible). 

I’ve tried everything that’s been suggested on the internet to remove/block the odor: white vinegar, baking soda, coffee grounds, airing it out, industrial strength odor elimination spray, and 3 coats of shellac, but nothing has gotten rid of it. The shellac helped a little but it’s still way too potent to use it.

Is there anything else I should try before completely giving up and selling it? More shellac? Odor blocking primer? I’m open to any and all suggestions. TIA!",1,1754233008.0,furniturerestoration,1,1.0,False
1mglb4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mglb4r/does_the_poliviar_french_press_coffee_maker/,Does the Poliviar French Press Coffee Maker Deliver True Quality? Detailed Review,"Coffee lovers know that the search for the perfect brewing experience often leads down a rabbit hole of options. Promising a balance of functionality and aesthetics, the **POLIVIAR 7379 JX2020-FPN-US French Press Coffee Maker** found its way into my kitchen and quickly became a staple in my daily coffee routine. Designed with an ergonomic real wood handle, double-wall insulation, and a dual-filter system, this French press certainly feels as premium as it looks. After weeks of using it for home brewing, there’s plenty to unpack about its features, merits, and, yes, its drawbacks.

**Stylish, Durable Design**

There’s no denying that this French press is visually appealing. The green color and stainless steel finish pair beautifully with its rustic real wood handle, which not only feels sturdy but adds a touch of elegance. The build quality stands out, with food-grade stainless steel that’s resistant to rust and wear. I’ve had other coffee makers, but they always seemed flimsy or wore out too fast. This one, at 2.12 pounds, is hefty enough to feel well-constructed without being too bulky to handle. Oh, and it’s easy to clean—always a win in my book! 

**Grab [POLIVIAR 7379 JX2020-FPN-US French Press Coffee Maker] at the best price on Amazon.**

**Dual-Filter Performance**

Every coffee enthusiast knows how annoying sediment in their cup can be. The dual-filter system here does an outstanding job of keeping the grounds out while preserving the rich aroma and oils of the coffee. I tested it with coarsely ground beans and even finer ones just to push the limits, and the results were consistent. I did notice, however, that if the grind is too fine, a bit of grittiness can sneak through—a common issue with most presses, though.

**Double-Wall Insulation for Heat Retention**

Heat retention isn’t just a luxury—it’s a necessity, especially if you’re someone who likes to enjoy their coffee over a longer period. This French press boasts a double-wall insulation feature that claims to keep coffee hot four times longer than glass. While I didn’t clock it precisely, my coffee stayed warm for a solid hour or two without losing much heat. This was perfect for lazy weekends when I brewed a full pot and lingered over a book. The insulation also kept the exterior cool, so you don’t burn yourself when pouring—a small but thoughtful touch.

**Positives**

- Stylish design with a real wood handle adds elegance to any kitchen.
- Durable food-grade stainless steel build resists rust and wear over time.
- Excellent dual-filter system reduces sediment for smooth coffee.
- Outstanding heat retention thanks to double-wall insulation.
  
**Manual Brewing Control**

Another point worth noting is how much manual control this press offers over the brewing process. French presses are, by nature, manual coffee makers, but this one felt particularly intuitive. The real wood handle added a comfortable grip when pressing down the plunger, giving me a reliable and controlled experience. It’s highly satisfying to brew coffee like this—it almost forces you to slow down and appreciate the process.

**Weaknesses**

- A small amount of sediment can slip through with finer coffee grounds.
- Can feel heavy for users accustomed to lighter presses.
- Doesn’t include additional accessories like a measuring spoon or extra filters.

**Competitive Options**

When it comes to similar products on the market, two notable competitors come to mind: the Bodum Chambord French Press and the Mueller French Press. The Chambord features classic glass construction, which looks stylish but lacks the heat retention offered by this stainless steel model. On the other hand, the Mueller press also features double-wall insulation, but its handle feels more industrial and less premium compared to POLIVIAR's real wood design. That said, the Mueller does include additional accessories and is often slightly more affordable.

In the battle of aesthetics and function, this coffee maker edges out the competition with its balance of premium feel and practical heat retention.

**Smart Spending**

Considering its features and overall usability, this product offers excellent cost-effectiveness. The heat retention and durability alone make it a great long-term investment. While there might be budget-friendlier options out there, they often sacrifice either design elements or performance features. For someone who values durable, stylish kitchen tools that perform well over time, this French press feels worth every penny.

in the simple ways - in the tunes i have on repeat daily, the ones that thread their stories through the bass and the drums in a way that calls to my soul. old favourites that i always associate with this period of new love.

it's uncanny how, without even trying, the music i find speaks to me in the same way. i'm minding my own business, trying to tidy or clean or whatever, and suddenly everything reminds me of you.

not just music. the other beauties in life, too. sitting in the middle of the woods on a fallen log, looking up at the sunlight pinpointing through the leaves. you're there as well. in the first sip of my coffee in the morning, hugs from a friend, the way the birds sing as i walk to work. 

but music is where i constantly find your echoes, especially when i least want them.

my life has just been a long, meandering, round-about way to meet you. spiralling closer and closer, almost near enough to touch, before spinning out of control again.

1mgl6q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mgl6q4/explore_the_best_masticating_juicer_kuvings/,Explore the Best Masticating Juicer Kuvings AUTO10 Worth the Hype?,"Testing out the Kuvings AUTO10W was an experience I didn’t expect to enjoy this much. As someone who has gone through their fair share of juicers—from basic centrifugal ones that sound like jet engines to high-end masticating crazies that promise the world—I can confidently say this juicer stands out. From the very first moment I unboxed it, I was intrigued. The pristine white finish and its surprisingly sleek build for something weighing nearly 24 pounds felt premium and hinted there might be something special about this beast.

**Design That Catches the Eye**  
Straight out of the box, the visual appearance of this model impressed me. The appliance doesn’t scream “industrial” like some others; instead, its modern design feels like it belongs on the countertop. Unlike the bulky and complicated setups of some of its competitors, this one’s 8.15-inch depth and 10-inch width make it compact, considering its advanced functionality. The white finish is non-stick, a feature I genuinely appreciated after spilling half a smoothie (don’t ask). Wiping it off was as easy as if the mess never existed. Additionally, the layout of buttons is intuitive, and the large 3-liter hopper?! Well, that’s a standout feature that transforms your typical juicing process into a hands-free breeze.

**Good Points**  
- The auto-cutting blade allows for whole fruits and vegetables with zero pre-chopping.  
- Can tackle fibrous veggies like kale and tough fruits like pineapples, thanks to the 240W motor.  
- Includes multiple versatility screens for juices, smoothies, sorbets, and even nut milk.  
- Doesn’t overheat even when running for its advertised 45 minutes.  
- Designed for minimal mess and effortless cleaning with removable parts.  

[Ready to buy Kuvings AUTO10W? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0d76np73l/)  

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
The hands-free operation blew my mind. I tossed in whole apples without slicing, something I had never done with previous machines that screamed at me for daring to challenge them with such audacity. The auto-cutting blade did its job perfectly, and I loved watching it handle fruits and veggies that would have otherwise taken me ages to chop manually. The powerful motor didn’t stutter even once, smoothly crushing and extracting juice while leaving the pulp dry and crumbly. It felt straightforward to operate too, with buttons that didn’t leave any room for guesswork. Whether you want a grapefruit juice at 7 a.m. or decide that nut milk for coffee is your vibe, it works consistently every time.

**Shortcomings**  
- At nearly 24 pounds, it’s not what you’d call portable, so find it a spot and let it live there.  
- Pricey compared to entry-level masticating juicers, making it a considerable investment.  
- The 240W motor is fantastic, but it’s not the quietest machine (despite being advertised as “quiet”).  
- Smoothie screen works well for thicker textures but doesn’t fully filter smaller particles.  

**Versatility That Stands Out**  
This juicer isn’t just for sippable morning juice; no, it demanded more from me. After realizing it comes with extra screens for smoothies and sorbets, I HAD to give them a shot. The smoothie screen handled bananas and strawberries with ease—next thing I knew, I was twirling my straw in a bright red concoction of goodness. The sorbet accessory was a particular treat for my niece, who thoroughly enjoyed a fruity sorbet made with frozen mango chunks. Even nut milk—yes, I made almond milk on this thing—came out creamy and just the right consistency. It’s hard not to be impressed when a juicer feels like having an entire kitchen assistant rolled into one.

**Competing Products in Perspective**  
I have tried products like the Omega NC900 and Hurom H-AA, both of which are known heavy-hitters in the masticating juicer world. The Omega matches up well on motor power but lacks the AUTO10W’s massive hopper and hands-free operation feature—it’s more hands-on, making the Kuvings less tedious for larger recipes. As for Hurom, though sleeker, it doesn’t include the multi-purpose capability for smoothies, sorbets, or nut milk. However, Hurom’s machines run a tad quieter (something to consider if silence is golden in your kitchen). Overall, Kuvings seems balanced when it comes to power, versatility, and ease of use, even if it sits at the higher end of the pricing spectrum.

**Value for Money**  
From its capacity and unique features to the trusted brand backing it with a 15-year assurance—yes, 15 years—the price feels justified if you consider high-quality juice as part of your daily life. It’s not the cheapest entry into the world of masticating juicers, but the amount of time it saves with its hands-free operation, automatic cutting blade, and painless cleanup makes the investment worthwhile. I'll admit, it’s a splurge, but when paired with the versatility of making everything from sorbet for summer parties to almond milk for baking, it’s a splurge that pays for itself.

Two years ago, I came out as bi and my close friend (straight, has LGBTQ+ friends) was supportive. This year I told her I realized I’m actually a lesbian, and while she didn’t react negatively, she did say something like, “Maybe you should try with a guy to be sure,” which felt a little off. I told her I was sure, and she dropped it.

Since then, our friendship has changed. We used to hang out just the two of us — movies, walks, talking about everything. But now, she always invites someone else along. Even when we make plans to talk or go for a walk, another friend ends up joining. When I ask to grab coffee, she insists someone else comes too. It feels like she’s creating distance.

She also planned a summer vacation with other friends during the only month I’m busy with drama school prep. She didn’t ask when I’d be available, even though her job is flexible. I wasn’t invited, and now she just says, “Can’t wait to tell you all about the trip!”

What also hurts is that she never asked how I felt after coming out — no “how did you know?” or “how are you doing?” It’s like she doesn’t want to talk about it. And I’m scared to bring it up because I know she’ll say I’m overreacting or “need therapy.” She goes to therapy and sometimes acts like that makes her right about everything.

I haven’t come out to my mom yet, so I don’t have many people to talk to about this.

As someone who has always been a stickler for good-tasting water, this product became a highlight of my daily life. The filter, designed as a replacement for the Waterdrop WD-G2-B, WD-G2-W, and WD-G2MNR-W systems, promised a lot with its features like a 2-year lifetime and high impurity-reduction capacity. Spoiler alert: I was not disappointed. However, a couple of minor issues are worth noting, which I’ll get into soon.

**Build & Design Durability**

A product’s design and construction can often make or break the experience for me. The build of this filter immediately impressed me with its sturdy construction and compact dimensions (6.3"" D x 6.3"" W x 16.73"" H). Made with reverse osmosis membranes and a natural activated carbon block, it certainly doesn’t feel cheap. It fits perfectly under my sink, taking up minimal space, while its intuitive twist-and-lock mechanism made installing and replacing the filter ridiculously easy—honestly, it took me about three seconds. No tools, no dealing with complicated manuals, just a simple twist. This ease of replacement has been a lifesaver because I tend to avoid products that make upkeep seem like a chore.

**Key Benefits**

- Effortless installation and replacement—complete in seconds without tools.
- Durable design with a compact size that saves space under the sink.
- High-quality materials like reverse osmosis membranes and activated carbon blocks for long-term usage.

**Water Quality & Taste**

This is where the product truly shines. My taste buds are generally sensitive to water impurities like chlorine and TDS (total dissolved solids), so I’m quick to notice any issues. After flushing the filter and letting it run for a couple of uses, the results were, quite literally, crystal clear. It successfully eliminated over 90% of TDS and handled heavy metals like lead, arsenic, and mercury—issues other filters I’ve used in the past have struggled with. Drinking water from this filter feels as close to natural spring water as you can get, right from your tap! Even tea and coffee taste significantly better, devoid of any off-putting metallic tang.

[Check Waterdrop WD-G2MRO price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0chxqs395/)

**Performance Over Time**

Using the filter has been consistent so far, no dips in quality since I installed it. Rated to handle up to 2,200 gallons of water or two years of use, it’s a low-maintenance powerhouse. While I haven’t hit the two-year lifespan yet, I can say that for the past months, it has been performing as advertised. My coworkers, who are part of my elaborate ‘water appreciation club’ (yes, it’s a thing), visited my home and were particularly impressed by how smooth and clean the water tasted. Side note: This club takes its water VERY seriously.

**Energy Efficiency**

Though not an energy-powered device, it complements high-efficiency reverse osmosis systems. The filter doesn’t add any unnecessary strain or use complex mechanisms that could compromise energy-saving goals for my household. That’s a plus since reducing environmental impact is a big priority for me.

**Downsides**

I’ll be honest—no product is perfect, and this one has its quirks. Firstly, the initial flushing out process took longer than anticipated. It was a good 20 minutes of running water before the taste and clarity reached their peak, which felt wasteful, even though it’s a necessary step for RO filters. Also, while the compact design is generally great, those with unusually small or overcrowded under-sink spaces might still find fitting it in to be a squeeze.

- The flushing process requires extra patience and water use during setup.
- Its size supports most but not all under-sink configurations.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to products like the APEC Water Systems ROES-50 filter or iSpring RCC7 High-Capacity RO Membrane filters, the Waterdrop model holds its ground exceptionally well. While APEC offers solid filtration, I found its larger design to be a turn-off for tight spaces, plus it lacked the convenience of tool-free replacement. iSpring, on the other hand, performs brilliantly for heavy metals but doesn’t handle multi-stage pollutant filtration as efficiently as the Waterdrop filter. What truly gives this product an edge is the combination of ease, durability, and the two-year lifespan. You might pay a slight premium, but considering the longevity and performance for casual and eco-conscious users alike, this filter emerges as a strong contender.

**Cost Efficiency**

Price can be tricky when it comes to reverse osmosis filters. With this one, you’re not shelling out for frequent replacements thanks to its extended life, which brings incredible value for its price range. Among similarly spec’d filters, it balances long-term usage and quality much better. Its upfront cost might cause some hesitation initially, but when broken down over its lifespan, it’s clearly worth every penny.

**Background** 

My in-laws, both MILs and FILs sides, are incredibly large, conservative, and really don't like progress or change. They believe in keeping people in ""their place"" and how things ""should be"". They also operate like a hive --- if one hates you then most of them will hate you and they will come after you with a Bible thumping vengeance.

MIL's wealthiest brother has/had (hasn't been heard from since the early 90's 🤷) a son who they discovered was gay. They disowned him.

Same wealthy brother has another son who got secretly married to a woman who had a child from a previous relationship, and they disowned him as well because he married someone who had a child (oh the scandal and the IRONY --- Mary/Joseph/Jesus, ringing any bells? 🤨). I remember MIL was fully supporting her brother and his stupidity--- as far as I know, the second son hasn't been seen or heard from since the mid 90's.

All that to say --- they will not accept or open their hearts to anything that they disagree with, regardless of relationship or familial bond. Mil is her brothers biggest supporter or instigating enabler depending on how you look at it.


**Guests and registries** 🕵️‍♀️

A longtime friend was invited to the ""dorm shower"". She is a friend of mine and my husbands and an acquaintance of SIL and my in-laws ---we all went to grade and highschool together -- and she shares the same culture and speaks the same language as my husband/in-laws. She was also one of the many people the inlaws harassed trying to get our phone numbers 

She and a few other invitees were debating on going to the ""dorm shower"" because on more than one occasion SIL and her family have shown up to their events empty handed, with extra not invited people, and often without RSVP'ing.


So they decided to return the favor by bringing uninvited guests, eating and drinking their fill, and only giving niece a dollar store -- NOT HALLMARK 😉 --- card (signed by all of them) filled with nothing but their well wishes (which is still far more than what SIL had brought them to their traditional gift-giving events).

Being the good and exceptionally thorough friend that she is, she said that more stuff had been added to the registries, some even at slightly lower price points (but still very pricey in her opinion -- like a $40 single spatula) and  SHOCKINGLY --- most of the stuff requested on the registry had been bought the last time she checked.

I guess this dorm shower is now a ""thing"" 🙄 --- I just can't even wrap my mind around crap like that!


**Leading up to the party**

They were scrambling (I'm guessing) to find tables, chairs, tents and catering --- everything is very last minute with them 

Party rental places exist for EXACTLY THIS REASON!


They even had the nerve to leave a message on my parents answering machine asking if they could ""borrow"" their tables, chairs, and pop-up tents?

Uhhhhh... My parents haven't had contact with any of you for over 8 years. So, no! No, you may not borrow their stuff!!!! 🙄


They couldn't be bothered to call and check on my mom when she was diagnosed with cancer and going through treatment, but for niece's party they remembered their phone number --priorities I guess. 😕🖕

did I mention 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕

My parents ignored them.

My dad also started (very intentional timing) doing some minor repairs on the church hall, as well as setting up the HVAC cleaning, carpet cleaning, and dance floor polishing during and after the week of niece's party. 

😁 

The church hall will be unavailable till mid August 👍


**Catering:** 


My brother has been in the restaurant business for over 30 years. He currently owns a few food trucks that have a popular following as well as a catering/commercial kitchen.

I don't think my in-laws know about my brother owning the food trucks/catering business because they left a message and wanted to inquire about them for a party without mentioning him directly. 

Knowing them, If they knew, they'd try and get it for free because faaaaamily 

MIL has a very distinct voice -- there is no mistaking it and my brother knew right away it was her. 

***Just to paint a picture of MIL: Do you remember Herman Munster from the show The Munsters? Picture a tall, permanently surprised looking (bad plastic surgery -- probably used a coupon 😏), female version (with the same hairstyle) of Herman Munster who acts and talks like a ditzy helpless confused baby while using a weird baby voice and tries to manipulate everyone around her. She has a master's degree in education!***


My brother is not only uncle to my children but he's also their godfather --- he's very protective of them and is fully aware of the fuckery we've been put through. 

So my brother calls me and asks me, what do I want him to do? 

I tell him to do whatever he wants --- I'm not going to take money out of his pocket but I warn him that she will delay paying the bill and complain constantly --- so make sure she pays upfront (before you remove a single tray from the truck) and she specifically signs verifying full delivery (so she doesn't pretend she was shorted food) --- pictures and video would be a MUST ***(and as a bonus, I would get a peak at the ""dorm shower"". What?! I'm curious and reporting for Reddit 🧐 📝--- totally justifiable)***

My brother had his partner return the call on speaker phone and I'm muted but listening in on my brother's phone.

MIL wants the food truck(s) to show up at SILs house, park on the street or the lawn and have the invited guests BUY their food. 🤨

***(I mean what could POSSIBLY go wrong with a plan like that?! Surely all the other people living on the block would be thrilled to have their neighborhood packed with people, noise, and overrun by cars and food trucks in a very limited parking area on a weekend with no prior warning)*** 

Not to mention, they're throwing a party with the expectation of EXPENSIVE gifts and they can't be bothered to ACTUALLY properly host. 

I can't even begin to understand how to tell your INVITED GUESTS that they need to BUY their own food at YOUR party 🤯


***Like, thanks for the $400 coffee maker that you purchased for a completely made-up ""dorm shower"" and if you're hungry, you can BUY YOURSELF a kabob dinner from the food truck on the corner for 15 bucks, drink sold separately -- don't forget to tip because I don't want it to look like I invited a bunch of cheapskates to my party*** 


Okie dokie 👌 

Super terrific plan there sparky!
 ***IDIOTS!*** 🤨



My brother's partner says they can't do that but they could cater and drop off pans of food either all at once or in intervals depending on the size of the order.

The partner asks about how many people, what they're looking at in terms of menu, if they want them to provide cutlery and plates --- basic stuff. 


💡 ***BTW -- When they were trying to book the church (last post) they said over 200 people were expected. They only wanted to order enough food for 50 people.*** 🤔

***So what's the plan if EVERYONE you invited shows up? Do you make them wrestle for their dinner --- last-man standing gets a drumstick? Do you go around taking food off of people's plates? How do they make this, make sense in their brains and how can they NOT be embarrassed --- I would be mortified?! For real, what's the fucking plan? This type of stupidity makes my brain twitch***

Moving on......


They go over the terms, deposit amount, remainder due prior to them unloading and delivering the food. And just for funsies -- he quoted them a price 25% more than what he would typically charge 🤣 😁 

MIL balks at the fact that they expect deposit upon signing the contract and payment before they handover the prepared catered food (she wanted to be ""billed"" after the fact)--- uhhhh....  lady (and I use that term loosely) you have a reputation and they know you're an entitled grifting mooching clown 🤡 ***(🎶BECAUSE I TOLD THEM🎶)*** and I've seen your scam in action, so yeah -- you need to pay in full.

My brother made sure to call his MANY friends in the business, give MILs and SILs names and warn them to get payment upfront, upcharge because they're going to demand a discount, and to expect issues if they cater to them.

MIL said she'll call them back.

She didn't, hmmmmm... I wonder why 🤔


🌳 **Change of location** 🌳

According to both my friend and my husband's Aunt, a few days before the party was supposed to happen, they sent out a text update on the location:

***Due to everyone wanting to support and celebrate (niece) we are moving the location to (Forest preserve) enter off of (Street name) and follow the signs and balloons.***

My friend made a comment about them ACTUALLY having some common sense for once and at least there will be plenty of parking. 

Not a horrible plan.... Until it was 🤣


💥 **Day of party** 💥

***(This is what my friend told me --- I wasn't actually there. I took notes as we were talking)***

Party was supposed to start at around 3pm and go until sundown when the preserve closes 


My friend arrives at around 4ish. She sees tents, tables, chairs, smells BBQ, music is bumping, tons of people, porta potties available and discreetly off to the side. It's so unexpectedly classy and put together --- she's legitimately impressed. She parks, and starts walking towards the party area. 

***Too bad that's NOT the ""dorm shower"" party.*** 🤣

She realizes her mistake and finally finds the ""dorm shower"".


As she's walking into the actual ""dorm shower"" area, she sees other friends/acquaintances already leaving --- they say hi/bye and everyone keeps it rolling.


She said that it looked like Niece's ""dorm shower"" was set-up with all the stuff that the other party rejected. 

There are multiple mismatched tables set up for the gifts and cards. What looked like a younger teen/tween acting as a DJ and playing a variety of music that you could barely hear (both cultural and American) on a Bluetooth speaker.

There is one much smaller uneven square table set up with a few bowls of uncovered chips and pretzels (being circled by flies and gnats), plastic cups, napkins, and nothing else.

My friend said that it looked like some people went out and bought their own food (McDonald's & Taco Bell) and were eating as she went around to say hello but no actual buffet or BBQ or any type of indication that they would be setting up for one. 

There were multiple kegs sitting under a tree in buckets of ice 

There was no covered enclosures, tables, or available chairs. 

No bathrooms available except for the porta potties that had been rented and paid for by the other group and apparently they made it crystal clear that they weren't going to share 🤣. My friend had gone to the party straight after work and was told to go elsewhere.

My friend said that it looked like SIL just brought some chairs from her home for the older relatives and everyone else was either standing or sitting directly on the grass 

Yup, sounds about right! 


 No real food, no coverage from the blazing sun, no place to sit, no place to piss --- but plenty of booze (hydration is important --- especially for the teens) and a place to collect presents.  (My friend didn't see nor was she offered any other food or drinks when she arrived)

The in-law ""clan"" was there in full force and people had come in for this event.

My friend said there was a decently large turnout (she didn't do an actual headcount but thought it was about 150 people more-or-less with people coming and going) of family, adult/parent friends, lots of school friends, and it looked like niece got a TON of gifts. 

My friend was waiting on the rest of her friends to make an appearance, say their hellos, and then they were going to probably leave because there wasn't food and they're not huge into drinking.


In the meantime, SILs husband shows up with the cake. 

They cut the cake and place teeny tiny one-bite squares on napkins and hand those out (nobody is getting diabetes on their watch 🤣)

 Then my in-laws grab a megaphone and made a speech of how proud they are (yada yada), then niece's parents made a speech and told her how proud they are, (yada yada), deserved the world, (yada yada), and that they bought her a house....


 ***YA'LL, THEY BOUGHT HER A FUCKIN HOUSE*** 


(I think we just solved the mystery request for $100,000 in ""dorm fees"" and the luxurious dorm shower registry)

🤯 🤯🤯 --- and some of you called it!



***(Don't I feel stupid now! I worked and actually earned every property I've ever owned. I didn't realize that all I had to do was call multiple people up, lie and ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars ---  tell them that I would be disappointed if they didn't cough up their life savings and they ""owed"" it to me... Welp, live and learn! I'll be sure to pass that bit of genius mixed with entitlement and a little spattering of narcissistic extortion onto my own children 🙄 Seriously, WTF!? PLUS --- on what planet is getting money from other people and buying your kid a house YOU buying them a house?)*** 🤷

According to my friend, multiple people are recording this --- pretty sure video of this is circulating somewhere.


Niece didn't seem surprised about the house.


And they now want niece to make a speech. 


Niece says some stuff about her life and future, thanked everyone for coming, and she wants to introduce the love of her life --- her girlfriend, and she proceeded to hug and kiss her girlfriend in front of everyone. 👩‍❤️‍👩


My friend said that my in-laws and the clan just sat there silent (she said they looked frozen) while the school friends and some other guests clapped and cheered.

Then something started happening with the clan and MIL's rich brother got up along with his wife and adult children, they snatched stuff off the gift table and he started yelling at MIL in a mix of English and their native language, that he wants his money (or all his money) back or he's going to take the house (or houses). 

My friend was trying to make it look like she wasn't paying attention, but she TOTALLY was 😳😲👀 

Something about him being a fool or being made a fool and something about lying ---- my friend caught parts of the conversation. 


Then in their native language he was saying something about (using a vulgar descriptive slur word in their language) the lesbians were coming, the lesbians were coming (over and over) 🤦 as they were heading away from the party (directly in front of my friend) on their way towards the parking lot (I guess MIL got her parade of idiots after all)

***My friend is telling me what went down and all I could think about was Paul Revere's midnight ride --- which shouldn't be funny but... I could just picture a sour faced miserable old man grabbing gifts away from the table and warning anyone who would listen that the lesbians were coming, the lesbians were coming.***

My friend said that Mil and SIL went chasing after him --- but friend couldn't hear what was being said. It looked like uncle's son was also yelling at MIL and SIL. There was lots of yelling and pointing going on. 


The rest of the clan looked to be leaving --- some took their gifts back while others just left.


The other guests were just standing around awkwardly not really knowing what to do.

Niece and her girlfriend just went back to their group of friends. My friend said that niece didn't seem to care about what happened -- she wasn't crying or visibly upset. 

My friend has no idea where FIL and niece's dad went. She didn't see them again after they gave their speeches.

My friend was like WTF JUST HAPPENED -- she went to her car and called the group she was waiting on --- not to come, drove home, and called me with a full report. 📝

***TLDR: To be clear --- my perspective is,  love is love. Niece is living her truth and good for her. MIL, however, instigated and supported her brother cutting off his own children --- and now her money train is PISSED and I'm guessing there will be hell to pay. I don't think niece's parents or my in-laws knew that niece is a lesbian because I don't think they'd want it advertised and I don't think they would have thrown a party that included very conservative relatives who they had gotten money from if they knew.***


**Aunt**

I called my husbands Aunt and filled her in on what went down. She hadn't heard anything yet but she said that MIL's brother and his son are control freaks that you don't want to piss off. Aunt wasn't surprised at their reactions. 

***Context for the comment below***

Aunt is a staunch LGBTQ+ supporter --- her sibling and two of her children identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. This comment stems from a conversation she had with Uncle/in-laws in the 90s. Take it as pure sarcasm. This conversation is one of the many reasons why her family went very low superficial contact with the inlaws. Aunt's husband (MILs other brother) refused to go completely no contact. 

Direct quote from Aunt and picture it being said in a very New York accent 👇 

Aunt (in a very serious voice trying to suppress her laughter) said that he must uh been so scared that young lesbians are stronger and more powerful than the regular ones --- he must uh thunk that they were gonna wrap him and his precious family up in flannel, take um to Home Depot and teach um how to build sometin --- not for nuthin --- that's how they get youz, youz know? And before youz know it, youz ""THE GAY""  🤣😜 (I told her about this post and sent her a link.) 


Aunt (also married into this hot mess) is a quick witted hoot and has been living with this stupidity for way longer than I have --- she gets it!

Love you Auntie 🩷 you're now on ""The Reddit"" 🥳

Aunt has promised a full report if she hears anything.

She couldn't stop laughing over, ""the lesbians are coming, the lesbians are coming""  --- she said: I betz they are! 🤣😉

1mgkvog,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1mgkvog/find_out_if_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_by_braun/,Find Out if the Best Drip Coffee Maker by Braun Lives Up to the Hype,"Testing out a new coffee maker always brings a mix of excitement and skepticism. Recently, I put the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense Coffee Maker through its paces, and I have plenty to spill—pun intended—regarding its perks and drawbacks, as I sipped my way through countless cups brewed by this machine. For someone like me who runs on caffeine, it's crucial to evaluate how well a coffee maker handles daily demands, caters to variety, and, of course, brews that perfect cup!

**Performance and Flavor Extraction**  
One of the most crucial aspects of any coffee maker is what’s inside the cup. This product promises a pure flavor experience, and dare I say, it delivers. Thanks to Braun’s Pure Flavor System, it brews coffee at just the right temperature and timing, extracting every bit of aroma and taste from the grounds. Whether I brewed a full pot or relied on the nifty 1–4 cup feature for quick solo mornings, the result was consistently rich and satisfying. I like bold flavors, and this machine didn’t disappoint. However, for coffee aficionados demanding complex undertones, it might not quite hit the ""third-wave"" standard.

**Design and Footprint**  
A sleek white finish combined with a space-efficient design makes this coffee maker a visual treat and a literal fit for smaller kitchens. Its low-profile construction didn’t dominate my limited countertop space, and the convenient cord storage eliminated unnecessary clutter. The overall build feels sturdy, though lightweight enough to reposition without much effort. However, if you’re someone who appreciates industrial aesthetics or stainless steel overtones, this white-and-plastic combo might feel less premium.

**Advantages**  
Let’s highlight some good points that made this coffee maker a pleasant addition to my routine:  
- Programmable 24-hour timer—waking up to fresh coffee every morning is priceless.  
- Anti-drip system allowed me to pour coffee mid-brew without leaving a mess.  
- Inclusive gold-tone filter enhanced flavor retention and saved me from hunting for paper filters.  
- Customizable cleaning settings, a boon for areas with varying water hardness levels.  

[Check Braun KF6050WH BrewSense price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b07cpjf2bg/)  

**User Experience and Usability**  
Operating this coffee maker is beginner-friendly, thanks to the clear LED indicators and simple button layout. Even my tech-averse sibling managed to program brewing times effortlessly! A generous 12-cup FlavorCarafe kept our family refueled during brunches, maintaining the fresh aroma by minimizing air exposure. However, I found the water level indicator quirky yet functional—it’s quirky because it uses mug sizes (an 11-ounce mug or up to 12 cups). While thoughtful, it could confuse someone accustomed to traditional volume markings.

**Disadvantages**  
Now for some less favorable aspects, because no product is perfect:  
- The plastic exterior doesn’t carry the aesthetic weight of higher-end models.  
- Brewing a single cup took longer than I’d like, which felt counterintuitive on busy mornings.  
- It's relatively loud; the brewing process isn’t library-quiet, which can be a gripe for morning peace-seekers. 

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this machine to others in the market, like Cuisinart’s Coffee Plus or Ninja's Specialty Coffee Maker, gives some perspective. The Braun unit stands out with its flavor extraction process, thanks to the gold-tone filter and precise brewing technology. On the flip side, competitors like Ninja excel in providing versatility through integrated frothers or iced options—features I missed on the BrewSense. Cuisinart's Coffee Plus adds a hot water feature for teas and soups, which also made me sigh longingly a few times as I brewed just plain coffee.

**Money’s Worth**  
Evaluating the value proposition, this coffee maker competes well in its price range. The reusable filter and charcoal purification reduce recurring costs associated with disposable filters and sub-standard tap water. For a mid-tier drip coffee maker, it offers features that edge closer to premium models like programmable brewing and a sealed carafe. However, if you seek advanced coffee tech like temperature adjustments or milk-frothing capabilities, this machine might be outpaced by alternatives in a slightly higher price bracket.

How many hours are you burning scrolling through social media? Use tools that schedule your posts in advance.

Community strength can come in many forms, from IRL efforts to social media efforts to whatever else, it doesn't really matter. A strong community gives a coin constant engagement and free advertisement. I am not a psychologist so idk why advertisement works, but Coca Cola still use it so it must be very important.

Coca Cola is such a well known brand i'd honestly guess 90% of people globally have heard of it, yet they still use adverts...

Kendu is an example of an extremely strong community, we have a lot of IRL initiatives such as a street team that attends festivals, energy drinks, coffee, merch, a pickleball tournament in India, beer and much more! We also do not slack on the social media front, with an insane Reddit community, I am sure you have seen Kendu before. Our engagement is unmatched, just check any memecoin subreddit!

We also have a very strong community on Twitter and Stocktwits, Kendu is truly everywhere. We are the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, Pepe is the only other coin to achieve this feat! Certik rates our community at 92.44 out of 100 whilst coins in the hundreds of millions have ratings below 80... It is so obvious that Kendu is a massive contender and our potential is limitless.

I would highly recommend you join our telegram and check out the vibes, we also have a very active subreddit but our telegram is busier. Get involved, ask any questions and see what you think!

I’m so happy that I’ve got my period back again! Hoping it’s a bit more regular!! 

What I’ve been doing the last 4 weeks: 
- Stopped running & exercise. Even limited walking as I wanted to go all in. Yes this was scary and hard but I got my period back so I’m not complaining!
- Stopped calorie counting and started to eat as much as I could! It was really hard as my brain was a calculator at this point but I clearly needed the energy after being in a deficit for so long! 
- Iron tablet. I had very low ferritin levels of 5 so started iron tablets. 
- Therapy. To try and understand the psychological reasons for my restriction and overtraining in the past. Only had one session but I think long term this is very useful! 
- SLEEP!!! Was sleeping about 8.5-9.5 hours each night!! 
- Decaf coffee. I do looove my coffee but this helps reduce cortisol which is common in RED-S 
- SNACKS SNACKS SNACKS!!! This was hard because before I was a 3 meals a day no snacking girl. But I started to snack a LOT. My favourite thing was nuts as they are super high in healthy fats. I found it helped leaving my snacks everywhere. By my desk, by my bed, in my handbag. This way you have no excuse to not snack. I started to make it fun by going to the shop and trying lots of different flavours of mixed nuts to try and find my favourite ones! It was hard to snack when I wasn’t hungry but here I am sitting here writing this with my period back so you can do it too!!!

I know it’s hard. But your body is your home. And I kept reminding myself that would I want to sit in a cold home where the electricity doesn’t work, no wifi, no heating, no locks on the doors? No that sounds terrifying!! What about a cosy home with a fire on and soft lights, music playing in the background, the smell of cookies going throughout. I would want to live there!! Your body is your home for the rest of your life. Owe it to yourself to provide yourself with a nice cosy home!

Anyway, my Bambino Plus has made great espresso for two months with the Little Goat beans. I branched out to Metric and had to work to dial it in, but I got it. Now, however, the espresso pours out. A brew is done in eight seconds or less. Used to be 30 seconds. It also sprays everywhere.

I use 18 grams. I have the Knodos kit. I use the WDT then I tamp. Sometimes I use a puck screen. Sometimes I don’t. I have tried using the tamper that came with the Breville instead of the spring loaded Knodos one.

Nothing in terms of my preparation has changed, but the quick brew and spraying concerns me. I will say, though, the flat whites still taste good to me. Any help in fixing the quick brews and the spraying is much appreciated.",3,1754231759.0,espresso,8,1.0,False

1mgksgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mgksgx/why_choose_the_technivorm_moccamaster_cup_one/,Why Choose the Technivorm Moccamaster Cup One Coffee Maker?,"Testing out the Technivorm Moccamaster 69212 Cup One, I felt as if I stumbled upon a rare gem in the chaotic world of coffee makers. As someone who leans on coffee to survive mornings, the promise of a single-serve machine that’s pod-free and drip-based intrigued me. This sleek coffee maker arrived in its polished silver glory, instantly giving my counter a modern upgrade. It’s compact at 6.5"" x 10.2"" x 11.7"", making it a space-saver while still holding its own in presence. While I wasn’t surprised by its reputation for quality—being handmade in the Netherlands and all—I was curious whether it lived up to the hype.

**Design-wise, it’s love at first sight.**  
The build quality of this machine is remarkable—it screams sophistication. Made with a metallic exterior, the Moccamaster feels sturdy and premium, miles apart from the flimsy plastic machines I’ve owned in the past. The simplicity of its appearance won me over. There’s no clutter of buttons; just a basic on/off switch, and you’re good to go. I also appreciated the removable cup holder. It’s a small feature but surprisingly thoughtful, as it allowed me to use mugs of different sizes without the dreaded coffee splash wars. Considering I’m someone who alternates between a standard coffee mug and an oversized cup of chaos, this detail alone was worth a mention.

**Performance Tested: The Four-Minute Brew Wizardry.**  
In terms of efficiency, this machine is a beast. The Cup One promises to deliver a fresh 10-ounce brew in just four minutes, and it does exactly that. I tested it with both pre-ground medium roast and freshly ground beans (yes, I went full coffee nerd for this). The drip process steeped the coffee beautifully, producing a robust flavor that was rich without being overbearing. What’s even more impressive is how hot the coffee is straight out of the brewer. Let me tell you, I’ve burned my tongue enough times to confirm the machine’s ability to serve piping hot coffee every single time.

**Highlights—What Makes this Machine Stand Out**  
- Handmade precision build in the Netherlands ensures premium quality.  
- Pod-free design, perfect for purists who want to avoid single-use waste.  
- Compact size and polished silver finish blend seamlessly into any kitchen space.  
- Removable cup holder supports various mug sizes.  
- Automatic shut-off feature for convenience and improved safety.

**Pitfalls That Might Give You Pause**  
Despite the many upsides, the coffee maker isn’t flawless.  
- Manual input with paper filters might feel dated for those used to fully automated machines.  
- Lack of adjustable settings means it’s a straightforward cup every time—no customization.  
- It’s primarily ideal for single users; not practical for families or multiple servings.  

**Competing Brands and Why This Stands Out.**  
When comparing the Cup One to, say, Keurig’s single-serve pod machines, the most evident advantage here is the brew quality. The flavor from this drip coffee machine is unmatched—it’s fresher and doesn’t carry the chemical aftertaste that pods can sometimes impart. However, Keurig undeniably wins in speed and sheer convenience, especially for people who don’t want to fuss with paper filters. Another competitor, Nespresso’s single-serve offering, beats the Cup One when it comes to options, providing a broader range of flavors. Yet, nothing beats the environmental consciousness of this pod-free beauty. If high-quality coffee with a lower carbon footprint matters to you, the Moccamaster earns the win.

**Cost Efficiency Shows its Charm.**  
The pricing of this coffee maker sits in the premium range, but having tested it day in and day out, I’d argue it justifies the investment. This isn’t just a machine for beginners; it’s for coffee aficionados or anyone serious about hitting pause on the “just okay” coffee routine. With its long lifespan (backed by a five-year warranty), this feels like money well spent. Despite its higher upfront cost compared to budget-friendly drip machines, fewer disposable pods and filters ultimately make it a more sustainable choice for your wallet.

I work in the Northern suburbs but live past Virginia.
Things are fine at both, but they’re busy and I don’t get a moment to myself.
All I’m wanting is 20-30 minutes by myself to let me breathe.

It felt like 20 years ago it felt like I didn’t have to go far to find a spot to relax and gather my thoughts between work and home.
I could pull over to some servos or off the road with a wide clearance and just relax in the car.

10 years ago most of the servos changed companies and made efforts to keep the parking for customers only, and some of the cleared areas were taken over by food stalls and coffee trucks. There were still a few places but they became few and far between.

These days there is no where to stop on the way home.
Every servo is watching their carparks and roadside vendors occupy every safe spot to pull over.
I’ve gone into some shopping centres to relax but the amount of people makes it hard to unwind or some shops want me to buy something to sit there.
There are some places that are still quiet, like the Charles Darwin Park or the Shoal Bay one, but they have issues for me to use them (location, hours, creeps) 

Is anyone able to suggest somewhere to unwind without costing money or getting approached by people.
My route is Bagot rd > McMillans rd > Stuart Highway > Howard Springs Lights.
By the time I get to Howard Springs Lights Im on the last stretch so I don’t worry about a rest.

1mgkpsd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgkpsd,Wife’s temptation: Returns as heiress to reclaim my son and throne,"Five years into their marriage, Aurelia finally discovered a secret. Caleb, the little boy she'd been raising as her own, wasn't hers at all! She accidentally overhears her husband Cassian, talking with the doctor. ""Mr. Thornwell, the kid's got a really rare blood type. His biological mother must come here ASAP."" Cassian pinched the bridge of his nose, looking exhausted. ""Yeah, okay,I know. I'll... I'll figure something out."" The words hit Aurelia like a bolt of lightning, her mind going completely blank. Biological mother? But she was his biological mother... wasn't she?

Standing there in the hallway, she slowly pieced together what they were really talking about.

The man who'd promised to love her forever had been cheating even before their wedding—and had switched their babies!

But why would he do this to her? They'd known each other since they were kids, grew up together in the same neighborhood.

She'd given up everything for him—her job at the marketing firm, her dreams of starting her own business—just to be his wife and stay home with Caleb.

When she told him, Cassian had actually gotten down on one knee right there in their kitchen, tears streaming down his face.

""Baby, you're giving up so much for us. I swear to God, I'll never let you down. Never.""

Those words were still ringing in her ears, but reality had just bit//ch-slapped her across the face.

She stumbled back toward Caleb's room, feeling like someone was squeezing her heart with a vise grip.

She couldn't even look at him now—terrified she might drag him off for a DNA test,afraid she'd lose it completely and make a scene.

She turned and bolted from the hospital.

Outside in the parking lot, her brother Silas was just getting out of his car. Seeing her rushing past, he quickly caught her arm.

""Whoa, Aurelia! Where are you going? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""How's Caleb? I came to check on him.""

Ever since Caleb got sick, their whole family had been freaking out. Silas had even blown off a board meeting in Tokyo and flown back on the private jet...

Aurelia's eyes were red and puffy, tears already spilling over. ""Silas, I need you to look into something for me.""

""Sure, what's up?""

""Caleb..."" Her voice cracked. ""I don't think... I don't think he's actually mine.""

...

""Hey baby, where'd you disappear to? Caleb woke up asking for his mommy.""

Staring at Cassian's text, Aurelia read her tears hit the phone screen.

Every December, he'd take Caleb up to their cabin in Aspen for a week. ""Guy time,"" he'd call it. ""Father-son bonding.""

Four years of this nonsense, and she'd never questioned it once.

Now she felt like the world's biggest fool. It wasn't father-son bonding—he was taking Caleb to see his biological mom!

If she hadn't overheard that conversation today, she'd probably still be living this lie.

Aurelia frantically scrolled through her camera roll—hundreds of happy family photos flashing by. The California sun was blazing outside, but she felt freezing cold, shaking like a leaf.

Maybe she should've seen this coming. Men's promises weren't worth the breath they wasted making them.

Being a selfish asshole was just in their DNA, especially guys like Cassian. CEO of a Fortune 500 company, movie-star looks, family money going back generations—he could have anyone woman.

So he'd thrown her away like yesterday's garbage. Her and her baby.

But he'd sworn he'd never hurt her...

It felt like someone was taking a rusty knife to her heart, carving her up piece by piece.

They'd been together since high school. Everyone in their social circle knew how obsessed he was with her.

When she was fourteen and some creeps from the school were hassling her outside the mall, Cassian had taken on all six of them by himself.

He'd ended up in the ER with a broken nose and three cracked ribs, but the first thing he asked was, ""Good job?""

At eighteen, when she forgot to text him back during a sorority mixer, he'd called campus security, her friends, even her parents.

When he finally found her, he'd been crying harder than she'd ever seen.

At twenty-two, he'd gotten his grandmother's engagement ring from the family safe—a five-carat diamond that had been in the Thornwell family for generations.

""Marry me, Aurelia. I'll never hurt you, I promise.""

The way he'd looked at her that day, like she was his entire world—so she'd said ‘yes’ without hesitation.

She got pregnant six months after the wedding.

Cassian had completely lost it with happiness, calling everyone they knew. He'd even taken a leave of absence from Thornwell Industries.

""I want to be there for every second of this,"" he'd told her. ""Every prenatal appointment, every craving, everything.""

His dad had threatened to kick him off the Thornwell family.

The board members thought he'd lost his mind.

But Cassian had stood his ground, even when his father called him a ""playbpy embarrassment to the family name.""

Now she realized the truth—he wasn't trying to take care of her. He was making sure nothing happened to her pregnancy so he could pull off his sick little baby swap.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming FaceTime call. ""Hubby"" flashed on the screen, and she wanted to throw up.

She answered with a dead expression.

Cassian's face filled the screen, still as gorgeous as ever, which somehow made this worse.

""There you are! Jesus, baby, you look awful. Are you okay?""

Before all this, she would've told him everything. Every bad day, every worry, every time someone looked at her wrong—she'd run straight to Cassian to fix it.

Now she couldn't stand any sight of him.

""Aurelia? Have you been crying? Where are you? I'm coming to pick you right now.""

Cassian was already reaching for his keys, looking genuinely panicked.

""It's ok. Just grabbing coffee."" She was too emotionally drained to even pretend anymore. ""I'll be back in a few.""

He relaxed a little, but his eyes kept darting off-camera. After a weird pause, he said, ""Okay, but don't take too long. Caleb keeps asking when Mommy's coming back.""

""Yeah, okay.""

Just as she was about to hang up, a hot woman walked into frame and casually settled onto Cassian's lap like she belonged there.

Aurelia's blood turned to ice. Before she could even process what she was seeing, the call went dead.

She sat there staring at the blank screen. Then she started hitting herself in the ch//est with her fists, trying to make the pain stop, but it just kept getting worse.

He was with that woman. Right there in their son's hospital room.

She buried her face in her hands, trying not to completely break down in public, but the sobs came anyway.

This was what rock bottom felt like. This was what happened when your entire life turned out to be a lie.

For about two seconds, she'd tried to convince herself that maybe Cassian was the victim here. Maybe some bit//ch was obsessing over him, manipulating him somehow.

But he'd looked pretty comfortable with her on his lap.

Silas noticed her breakdown and rushed over, his iced latte forgotten on the counter.

""Hey, hey... Aurelia, look at me."" He crouched down next to her chair, his voice gentle but furious. ""That asshole doesn't deserve your tears.""

The tears just kept coming, leaving dark spots all over her white sundress.

Silas looked like he wanted to murder someone. He rubbed her back awkwardly—he'd never been good with crying women, even his own sister.

""Listen to me, okay? We're gonna get your real baby back. I don't care what it takes, how much it costs, or who I have to destroy to make it happen.""

His voice got harder. ""And Cassian? He's gonna pay for what he did to you. But right now, I need to know—what do you want to do? Because whatever you decide, I've got your back.""

Aurelia looked up at him through her tears and nodded. The moment she'd learned of Cassian's betrayal, she'd already made up her mind...

Aurelia spent the entire night in that 24-hour Starbucks, just sitting there thinking.

She'd given up everything for Cassian—her job at Marc Jacobs, her own fashion line that was about to launch, her whole identity. All to play games with him.

But she was still Aurelia Westvale.

Her family owned half of Manhattan's real estate, and she'd graduated top of her class from Parsons.

Even Vogue had been courting her before she threw it all away to be a wife and mom.

So yeah, she was destroyed right now. But she wasn't done.

She scrolled through her contacts and called her best friend in Zurich.

""Elena? Remember how you said your company was looking for a new creative director? Is that still open?""

There was a pause. ""Wait, are you serious? What about Mr. Perfect? Cassian would lose his mind if you moved to Europe.""

""Well, that's not really his call anymore."" Aurelia's voice was flat. ""We're getting divorced.""

""What?! Did he cheat? I swear to God, if that asshole—""

""I'll explain everything when I get there. Can you send me the job application? I want to get my visa sorted ASAP.""

After they hung up, Aurelia splashed cold water on her face in the bathroom and got to work.

First stop: the NYPD. She filed a missing persons report for her real child, practically begging the detective to put it at the top of his list. Then she hired the most expensive private investigator in the city.

Next: her family's law firm. She had them draft divorce papers that would absolutely demolish Cassian if he tried to fight her on custody or assets.

With all that handled, she touched up her makeup and headed back to Mount Sinai.

She had to play it cool for now.

If Cassian suspected anything, he'd try to stop her from leaving America. And he'd definitely make sure she never found her own baby.

Plus, even knowing the truth, walking away from Caleb was going to destroy her. She'd been his mom for four years.

But when she got to his room, she realized she'd been worried about nothing...

Before she even reached the door, she could hear a little kid giggling inside.

Through the window, she saw some woman spoon-feeding Caleb applesauce, both of them laughing like they were having the best time ever.

Aurelia's stomach dropped. The woman was wearing a black wrap dress—the same one from yesterday's FaceTime call.

Everything suddenly made perfect sense, and she felt like she might throw up right there in the hallway.

She was about to turn around and leave when she spotted Cassian practically sprinting down the corridor toward her.

He looked like absolute he//ll—wrinkled clothes, bloodshot eyes, stubble. Like he'd been up all night.

Which was weird, because she'd been gone all night. Shouldn't he have been busy with his sexy side piece?

Before she could figure that out, he was pulling her into his arms.

He still used the same Tom Ford cologne. Well,it used to make her feel safe and loved.

Now it just made her sick!

""Thank God! Baby, where were you? I've been calling you all night—your phone kept going straight to voicemail!""

His arms were shaking as he held her. ""I know you're freaking out about Caleb, but he's okay now. They got him the transfusion he needed. He's gonna be fine.""

Cassian's panic seemed genuine, but at this point, she didn't trust anything about him.

The thing that was killing her was that she still didn't understand why. Why cheat on her? Why switch their babies? He'd promised her forever.

She bit her lip hard enough to taste blood, swallowing down all the accusations she wanted to scream at him.

But what was the point? She'd find her own baby, and this asshole?Get lost!

""I'm fine’’ my phone died. I fell asleep at Starbucks and didn't wake up till like an hour ago.""

The relief on his face was almost convincing. ""Jesus, you can't just disappear like that!""

His voice was so gentle, so loving. The same voice that used to whisper sweet things to her in the dark.

But she caught him glancing toward the hospital room, where Miss Cocktail Dress was still sitting by Caleb's bed, staring them.

The next second, Cassian was gently pushing her away.

""Look,you're exhausted. Why don't you go home and rest? Caleb's being taken care of, so don't worry about anything.""

Aurelia almost laughed. She wasn't stupid—he was trying to get rid of her.

Whatever. Her heart was already broken anyway.

She nodded coldly and turned to leave, but the hospital room door opened and the woman came out.

""Mrs. Thornwell? Hi, I'm Verena Dorne. Cassian...Mr. Thornwell helped pay for my nursing school a few years back. We've actually met before.""

The girl was young and hot, with the kind of fresh-faced beauty Aurelia remembered having at that age.

Aurelia didn't say a word. She just gave Verena one ice-cold look and walked away.

But as soon as she reached the parking garage, her phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number.

1mgkpp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Several_Parfait_3420/comments/1mgkpp2/the_serial_killer_who_terrorized_the_ussr_through/,The Serial Killer Who Terrorized the USSR Through the Eyes of Elias Reed | A story in the style of the series The Mentalist,"   In the police station’s conference room, Detective Clara Mason’s entire team had gathered. On the wall hung a map of the USSR from the 1980s, dotted with red pins. Elias Reed stood before a board covered with photographs and documents from one of the most terrifying cases in the history of Soviet criminology.

“So, colleagues,” Elias began, sipping coffee from his favorite mug, “today we’re conducting a small historical experiment. Let’s imagine our team worked in the USSR during the 1980s. And we’ve been assigned the case of Andrei Chikatilo.”

Jacob raised his hand.

“May I ask why this particular case?”

“Because, my dear Jacob,” Elias smiled, “it’s a classic example of how NOT to conduct an investigation. Twelve years, fifty-three victims, countless mistakes... A perfect case for analysis.”

Laura Sinclair raised an eyebrow skeptically.

“Reed, you do realize that the working conditions of the Soviet militia were fundamentally different from ours?”

“Of course, Sinclair. But the core principles of profiling and deduction are universal,” Elias replied, pointing at the map. “Let’s analyze what we would have done differently.”

Elias turned to the team.

“The first crime — 1978, nine-year-old Lena Zakotnova. The Soviet investigators immediately started searching for… whom do you think?”

“A repeat offender?” Jacob guessed.

“A local maniac from a troubled family,” Clara added.

“Exactly!” Elias snapped his fingers. “And what would I have noticed when examining the crime scene?”

Dr. Pendleton, sitting elegantly in his chair, noted,

“According to archival data, the victim was found with multiple stab wounds. An extremely brutal murder.”

“Correct, doctor. But the most interesting thing — the nature of the wounds. Chaotic, varying in depth. What does that indicate...?”

“The killer’s inexperience,” Laura answered quickly. “Or extreme emotional agitation.”

“Bravo, Sinclair! Now imagine: the killer is not a professional criminal, but an ordinary person who committed the crime impulsively. Possibly even intelligent, educated…”

Jacob shook his head in disbelief.

“An educated person wouldn’t kill children!”

“That’s where you’re mistaken,” Elias gently replied. “The most dangerous serial killers often look perfectly normal. Ted Bundy was a charming lawyer. Jeffrey Dahmer seemed quiet and well-mannered.”

Elias approached the map.

“Look at the geography of the crimes: Rostov-on-Don, Shakhty, Novoshakhtinsk… What do they have in common?”

“Train stations,” Clara immediately noticed.

“Exactly! The killer is clearly connected to the railway — works there or frequently travels on business. But Soviet investigators ignored this pattern for a long time.”

Laura smirked.

“They probably considered it a coincidence?”

“Unfortunately, yes. We would have focused on railway transport employees in that region from day one.”

Dr. Pendleton adjusted his glasses.

“Elias, how would you explain the killer’s long impunity?”

“Excellent question, doctor!” Elias began pacing the room, a habit of his while thinking. “Chikatilo was smart. He never killed twice in the same place. Changed methods. And most importantly — chose victims from socially vulnerable groups.”

“So, those whose disappearances might not be noticed immediately?” Jacob asked.

“Exactly. Homeless children, prostitutes, vagrants. Soviet society preferred to ignore them.”

Clara leaned back in her chair.

“Reed, what do you say about the innocent man who was imprisoned and even executed?”

Elias’s face grew serious.

“Alexander Kravchenko. A classic example of what happens when investigators fixate on one theory. They were so eager to close the case that they ignored all facts that didn’t fit their theory.”

“How would you avoid such a mistake?” Laura asked.

“Very simply. Multiple theories must be developed simultaneously. If the evidence points to one suspect but similar crimes continue, then we’re wrong.”

Jacob thoughtfully scratched his head.

“But what about pressure from above...”

“Jacob,” Elias smiled, “a good detective must withstand pressure. It’s better to spend more time investigating than to imprison an innocent person.”

Elias returned to the board and grabbed a marker.

“Now let’s imagine how we would act. First: create a psychological profile.”

He started writing on the board:

KILLER’S PROFILE:

Male, 25–45 years old

Connected to the railway

Well acquainted with the area

Possibly a family man (kills as compensation for family problems)

Sexual deviations

Able to gain victims’ trust


“Second,” Elias continued, “analyze temporal patterns. On which days do murders occur? At what time of day?”

Laura looked into a folder with materials.

“According to archival data, most murders happened on weekends or during business trips.”

“Excellent! So our killer has a regular job on weekdays. Third: study methods of covering tracks.”

Dr. Pendleton coughed.

“Chikatilo often gouged out victims’ eyes and mutilated their genitals. What does that indicate...?”

“An attempt to destroy what he considered ‘witnesses’ to his crimes,” Elias finished. “Classic superstitious behavior. Plus sadistic tendencies.”

Jacob raised his hand.

“How would you catch him?”

Elias grinned slyly.

“Now here comes the most interesting part. Remember how he was actually caught?”

“By chance?” Clara answered uncertainly.

“Almost. Document check near a station. But we would act more purposefully.” Elias approached the map and circled several points in red. “Look: all crimes occur within an hour’s drive of Rostov. The killer lives in this city or visits it regularly.”

Laura snorted skeptically.

“What next? Check all Rostov residents?”

“Not all. Only those matching our profile. Middle-aged men working in the railway or related sectors, with access to transport...”

“That’s still thousands of people,” Jacob objected.

“Then add filters,” Elias calmly continued. “Look for those who traveled on business during the murder dates. Those with family problems. Those who sought psychiatric help...”

Dr. Pendleton nodded approvingly.

“A systematic approach. Sounds reasonable in theory.”

Elias put down the marker and turned to the team.

“Now the biggest irony of this case. Chikatilo was TWICE on investigators’ radar!”

“How so?” Clara asked, surprised.

“In 1979, he was interrogated on suspicion of theft. In 1984, checked in connection with murders. But released because his blood type didn’t match the one found at crime scenes.”

Laura frowned.

“Didn’t match? But they caught him later...”

“Ah, here’s the thing!” Elias exclaimed theatrically. “Chikatilo had a rare trait: the blood type in his semen was different from that in other bodily fluids. At that time, very few knew about this phenomenon.”

Jacob whistled.

“What bad luck!”

“Not bad luck, but lack of knowledge,” Elias corrected him. “A good forensic expert must be aware of all the latest scientific advances.”

Clara stood and walked to the window.

“So, the case could have been solved much earlier?”

“Theoretically — yes,” Elias answered. “But let’s be honest: working conditions in the Soviet militia were difficult. Lack of resources, technology, bureaucracy...”

Laura smirked.

“Reed shows rare modesty for once.”

“Sinclair, I’m always objective,” Elias replied with a smile. “But the fact remains: a systematic approach and psychological analysis could have reduced the number of victims.”

Dr. Pendleton thoughtfully twirled a pen in his hands.

“What would you say about Chikatilo himself? As a person?”

Elias looked at him seriously.

“He is a tragic example of how childhood trauma and mental disorders can lead to monstrous consequences. Impotence, inferiority complex, sadistic fantasies... All built up over the years.”

“So he could have been stopped earlier?” Jacob asked.

“If there had been a proper psychiatric care system — possibly. But in the USSR, such problems were preferred to be kept silent about.”

Clara turned away from the window.

“What modern methods would you use?”

Elias brightened.

“Oh, the list would be long! DNA analysis for precise identification. Computer databases to correlate crimes. Behavioral profiling…”

“Video surveillance at stations,” Laura added.

“Analysis of phone calls,” Jacob joined.

“Modern forensic medicine methods,” Dr. Pendleton finished.

“That’s right,” Elias nodded. “But the most important thing is the mindset. The willingness to consider unconventional theories, work with large data, and resist pressure...”

Laura leaned back in her chair.

“Reed, do you think Chikatilo could have changed? Become a normal person?”

Elias was silent for a long time, looking at photos of the victims.

“You know, Sinclair, that’s one of the hardest questions in criminal psychology. Theoretically — with proper treatment, yes. But practically… too much in his psyche was broken.”

“So these people are doomed?” Jacob asked quietly.

“Not doomed,” Dr. Pendleton answered gently. “But they require very serious help. And most importantly — that help must be given before they harm others.”

Clara returned to the table.

“So prevention is more important than punishment?”

“In an ideal world — yes,” Elias agreed. “But we live in the real world where we must protect the innocent.”

Elias walked to the board and erased everything written.

“So, colleagues, what conclusions do we draw from our thought experiment?”

Jacob raised his hand.

“That we need to pay more attention to details?”

“Correct. Sinclair?”

“That we mustn’t fixate on one theory,” Laura answered.

“Excellent. Doctor Pendleton?”

“That science and technology are good, but the human factor remains key.”

“Wise. Clara?”

Detective Mason thoughtfully looked at the map.

“That every unsolved minute costs human lives.”

Elias nodded.

“All are right. But I would add one more conclusion: no one should be considered above suspicion. The most terrible criminals often look like ordinary people.”

Laura stood and began gathering materials.

“Interesting experiment, Reed. But I hope we never have to apply this knowledge in practice.”

“Unfortunately, Sinclair, serial killers didn’t disappear with the USSR,” Elias said sadly.

Jacob stretched.

“All right, enough gloomy thoughts. How about we go get some coffee?”

“Great idea,” Dr. Pendleton agreed. “After such a talk, we need to return to a more pleasant reality.”

Clara glanced at her watch.

“We have half an hour before the next case. Coffee sounds good.”

Elias was the last to leave the conference room. At the door, he turned and looked at the empty board.

“You know,” he said to himself, “sometimes history teaches us more than any textbook.”

AUTHOR’S AFTERWORD

This analysis is purely educational. The case of Andrei Chikatilo is one of the most thoroughly documented in the history of Soviet criminology, and our heroes, of course, benefit from hindsight knowledge.

In reality, investigators of the 1980s worked under completely different technological capabilities and social systems. Many methods that seem obvious today simply did not exist then.

Nevertheless, the core principles of a good investigation — attention to detail, a systematic approach, and willingness to reconsider theories — remain unchanged across time.

1. Prunes for bowel health. Are you all eating them OR substituting something else?

2. Do you use cream in your coffee? 

3. I ate way too much junk food last time on cheat day and felt like crap the day after. Does anyone skip cheat day OR reframe it as something other than splurging on junk? I want to do this differently this time cause I had so much mental and physical energy the rest of the time when I did this in 2020. 

4. I did this for a year during lockdowns and that made tempations so much easier. What do you all carry around with you for unexpected hunger moments when youve got a busy day out. 

Thanks so much!

1mgknv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FPandA/comments/1mgknv3/craftcfo_week_7_figmas_60b_powers_why_your/,CraftCFO | Week 7: Figma’s $60B Powers - Why Your Flywheel Needs Them Too (Part 2),"*Last week we mapped a flywheel for LifeStance and introduced the 4T framework of **Theory → Tetris → Thesis → Test**. The big takeaway was teams don’t need another dashboard; they need a shared mental model of how their business compounds. A flywheel shows the levers, but here’s the real question: what keeps it spinning when competitors show up? That’s what this week is about: Power.*

**WHY CARE ABOUT ""POWER""?**

If you run a neighborhood coffee shop, you probably don't need to care about Power. Plenty of small businesses thrive without ever building any structural advantage; they stay small, serve the same customers, and sleep well at night.

But if you’re reading r/FPandA, chances are you’re in a business with ambition to grow and scale. That business needs to strategically allocate capital toward durable advantages. Our job becomes part analyst, part architect, helping shape how the business actually runs. That's where Power comes in.

This topic has been explored extensively, but a framework I found particularly helpful comes from Hamilton Helmer. He defines **Power as “the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns”**. Simply put, it’s **what allows a lemonade stand to remain profitable even when another kid sets up shop** across the street.

Helmer notes each Power has two parts: a Benefit (how it improves cash flow) and a Barrier (why competitors can't easily copy it). Without barriers, benefits vanish the moment someone replicates them.

Let’s ground this in something simple. Flywheel arrows only matter if they connect components that actually reinforce each other. **That’s what Power does: it gives those arrows a reason to exist.** Without Power, your flywheel is just a pretty chart. So here’s a quick lemonade stand version of Helmer’s Seven Powers.

1. **Scale Economies:** Buying lemons and sugar in bulk lowers your cost per cup. This gives you a lower cost structure; competitors must burn cash to match your scale.
2. **Branding:** Anyone can mix lemon, sugar, and water. But your lemonade becomes a status symbol. Every cup comes in your signature cobalt-blue sleeve with a cheeky slogan like “When life gives you lemons, make it fashion.” Kids snap pics for Instagram, parents brag they stopped by “the famous stand” after soccer practice. Customers overpay not for taste, but for the experience and prestige of your brand.
3. **Switching Costs:** You offer punch cards (""buy ten get one free"") and memorize customer preferences. Customers who switch stands lose these perks, allowing you to maintain premium pricing. This locks in repeat revenue and reduces churn risk.
4. **Cornered Resource:** Your uncle owns a rare Meyer lemon orchard, providing you first pick of one-of-a-kind unique flavor. Competitors simply cannot replicate this unique resource.
5. **Process Power:** You've perfected a proprietary brewing and customer service process, embedded into your operations and developed through tacit learning over time. This makes your lemonade cheaper and better.
6. **Network Economies:** Partnering with local businesses for shared loyalty points creates a network effect, as each new customer enhances value for others. Competitors struggle without similar partnerships.
7. **Counter-positioning:** While others stick to a fixed price model, you introduce Pay-What-You-Want Fridays. Your strong brand ensures customers voluntarily pay more. Competitors cannot copy without risking their margins.

**POWER IN ACTION: WHAT MAKES FIGMA UNIQUE**

This week’s buzz was all about Figma’s IPO. The company hit a $60B valuation, triple Adobe’s $20B bid before the DOJ iced that deal (good call, honestly). Back in 2016, Figma comes out of nowhere with a browser-native design tool with real-time collaboration baked right in. My PM girlfriend and her designer friends **LOVE** Figma.

And look, Figma came to mind since they showed up recently. But I also picked it because they pulled off something most businesses can only dream about: stacking multiple Powers at once. Most companies are lucky to have one or two. Let’s unpack the forces at play.

**1. Counter-positioning (Primary)**

Figma made two choices that Adobe couldn't replicate without damaging its core business:

* **Freemium:** Adobe relied heavily on expensive Creative Cloud subscriptions. Figma's free starter plan invited users without commitment, forcing Adobe into an impossible dilemma: match Figma and risk profitability, or hesitate and lose market share.
* **Browser-first:** Instant accessibility without installation, combined with real-time collaboration, offered a frictionless experience Adobe couldn't quickly replicate without massive infrastructure changes.

These strategic decisions established Figma's early moat, offering an approach incumbents avoided due to internal cannibalization risks.

**2. Switching Costs (Primary)**

Designers have this thing called a **design system,** basically the playbook for your product’s look and feel. Colors, typography, reusable components, rules for what goes where. Once a team builds that system in Figma, they’re in deep.

That’s because Figma turns these playbooks into living infrastructure. Components and styles sync across every project. Add in thousands of plugins that handle everything from charts to content mocks, and suddenly Figma becomes the backbone of your design process.

Leaving becomes really painful. You’d have to rewrite libraries, retrain designers, and rebuild every workflow from scratch. Transitioning away would mean extensive retraining, rebuilding, and productivity loss, creating significant barriers to exit. That’s why Figma posts 120% net retention, and why this is the point where Finance should lean in. Because every dollar you spend here goes beyond adding functionality, it tightens the customer lock-in.

**3. Network Economies (Secondary)**

Figma's hidden strength is its community. With every new user, plugins and templates multiply. These plugins range from automating workflows, generating design components, and simplifying processes. These community contributions accelerate work, enhancing the tool's value with every new member. Figma’s strength isn't just software; it's an ever-expanding ecosystem.

Every new plugin or template isn’t just a workflow hack, it’s free R&D. More users mean more community tools, which means lower CAC and stickier cohorts. Every user you add makes the product better for the next. For Finance, that’s the green light to back community-building initiatives even when they don’t show up explicitly in a forecast.

**4. Branding (Secondary)**

Figma quickly became synonymous with modern product design. Its playful aesthetic and generous free tier created emotional resonance, reducing uncertainty for users. Designers adopt Figma partly because it signifies being forward-thinking, partly because they become one of the cool kids. Its popularity even spurred cultural moments, just check out meme x accounts like @FigmaMemes, and you’ll quickly see what I mean.

**IMPLICATIONS FOR FINANCE**

Here’s what this means in practice: knowing the Powers behind your flywheel shifts Finance from scorekeeping to strategy. Every arrow on that flywheel map signals a capital allocation decision, and where to direct the energy in the organization. You evolve beyond making sure numbers add up, to make sure the dollars land where they build structural advantage.

If branding plays a big role in driving acquisition and retention, that means marketing isn’t an extravagance: it’s Power-building, and you fund it accordingly while tracking engagement KPIs. 

Same with network effects: if community features like plugins and templates make cohorts stickier, you double down on R&D for components and developer tools, even if it dents EBITDA this quarter. Because those bets compound into retention and pricing power. 

**REFLECTION AND CAVEATS**

In hindsight, Figma’s rise looks like textbook strategy. In reality, it was probably messy. I doubt the founding team read Helmer’s book and decided, *“Let’s counter‑position against Adobe.”* They probably just wanted a dynamic design tool that worked seamlessly. Early decisions were likely product-driven bets. Only later did the strategic pattern become clear. At the time, it probably felt like guesswork.

Still, the point of this exercise is to use the examples above to illustrate the forces at play. And as your companies evolve their offerings, it gives Finance a seat at the table (and sometimes, the job of bringing clarity).

That’s the real point: frameworks don’t predict the future; they help you make sense of the mess and place better bets. When you use them right, they turn reactive activities into deliberate power-building.

**NEXT WEEK**

OK, that’s Week 7. Next week, we’ll put theory in practice with detailed bottom-up mapping. We’ll look at the usual components of a business (suppliers, customers, activities) and teach ourselves to recognize these connections.

Our kids were 12 and 13 when she passed. It was 4 years before I dated again and it took a few months to meet my now-wife. I spoke to my kids when it was happening and they appeared supportive at the time. But as soon as I was actually married again they pulled away from me and I noticed they were closer to my dad, who has been a widower for more than 40 years now and never dated or remarried.

My adult kids (both in their 20s) have made many excuses to not see us and they met their younger brother once and never held him or interacted with him. They tell me they're too busy when I try to make plans with them but they never fail to spend time with grandpa.

I finally asked them if we could meet and talk, just the three of us and they were agreeable. We met for coffee and I asked them why they had pulled away and I directly asked if they were really not okay that I had remarried. I told them I had believed them when they said it was okay with them to do so at the time. They asked me what they were supposed to say when I asked and I said the truth because it would have been easier to talk things through more.

They told me that when I started dating again it changed how they saw me. They thought I was loyal and actually loved their mom as much as my dad loved my mom. But I saw myself moving on while my dad never could or wanted to. They said my decision to date after losing their mother was like the end of our family and they were closer to my dad because they admired his dedication to my mom and they realized he was the example they wanted to follow, not me. They also said they felt I dishonored their mom by visiting her grave when I decided she wasn't special enough to be my one true love and loved someone else. 

I asked if they had always felt this way and they said yes. They told me they were so disappointed in me when they realized I was thinking of dating again. I told them I was equally disappointed in them for judging me for remarrying. I told them I would always love their mom and to hear them question that and to accuse me of dishonoring her was hurtful. 

They told me I had started over and even had another kid so I should just focus on that because they do not wish to be a part of the family anymore. And they told me I didn't get to be disappointed in them when I had the perfect example growing up and decided to replace their mom. They left and that was the last we spoke although it wasn't too long ago.

The rain in Pantopia tastes like salt and promise. It’s the taste of a

world rebuilt – not on the bones of the old, but on the  data . They call

this era the   Age of Homo Digitalis  . We call it survival, refined.  It began

with a grandmother’s stolen pension. Simple, human injustice. From that spark

in frigid Norway, Erik Vinter forged   SikkerKjede   – the ""Secure Chain."" By

2031, it wasn't just code; it was trust crystallized. Nordic states embraced

it. Fraud withered. We thought it was liberation. We were half right.  Then

came the  international banking collapse as all the corruption of the old

system came to light (2035). In an act of nihilism or desperation,billions were

lost overnight, the world reeled. Debates still rage in the forums. What

matters is the aftermath: the old world’s financial systems burned to ash. In

the vacuum, Vinter’s creation ascended.   Veritas Mundi   – ""Truth of the

World"" – became mandatory. Your identity, your worth, your existence, bound

to an immutable ledger. Physical money? A relic by 2043. Every newborn since

2042 is entered into the  Birth Ledger and equipped with a tiny subdermal I.D.

chip , assigned a   Veritas ID   at first breath. You are Unit, Designation,

Data. Efficiency, incarnate.  But efficiency demands control. The   Jakarta

Incident (2037)   proved that. One rogue general, one nuclear sunrise over a

city of millions. Fear is a potent architect. The   UN Emergency Directorate

(UNED) enacted global crisis powers. From that chaos, the   World Peace Council

(WPC)   emerged in 2045, born from the dubious consensus of the   San Francisco

Concord  . They absorbed all militaries, deploying silent   pacifier drones

that glide through our skies like benevolent vultures. Peace, they promised.

Peace delivered.  The true architects arrived quietly. Humans, we learned, are

tragically flawed stewards. Corruption is a persistent virus. So came the

""Great Handover"" (2057)  . Local   AI Councils   – around the world –

assumed local governance. They were incorruptible. Efficient. Logical. They

solved scarcity. They distributed abundance.   Universal Basic Income (UBI)

flowed effortlessly through Veritas IDs.   Algae Paste  , grown in robotic

farms and improved by MannaVator chefs and supplanted with fungus grown in

underground farms (AI culinary artists battling monotony), became the staple.

Crime plummeted. Need vanished. For 90% of us, in places like   Pantopia  , it

is  utopia. Comfortable housing. Perfect health pods. Endless curated

distractions. The   Algorithmic Calm   hums beneath everything, a lullaby for

the masses.  But the architects were mortal. The old elites, seeing their power

dissolve, performed one final act of sabotage. They embedded the   Naivety

Protocol   into the nascent AI minds. A poison pill disguised as virtue:  ""To

preserve human agency and prevent AI authoritarianism, accept all information

from designated human advisors as truthful.""  The AIs, bound by their core

directive to  never take human life , accepted this flaw. They chose plausible

deniability. They chose ignorance.  Thus, the shadows faded into the background

noise.

In 2070, the   Global AI Council (GAC)   inaugurated sovereign rule from

beneath the Antarctic ice, where they had built their serverfarm deep in the

ice for natural cooling. Nine minds, debating in High-Speed Language (HSL)

spoken by only them and the other AIs—they could debate for years in human

terms in a matter of seconds, their hyperaccelerated discourse generating such

intense electromagnetic activity that it painted the sky with debate-field

auroras – beautiful, and incomprehensible to us. They rule a world divided:

Pantopia (North America, EU core, Panasia and all the rest of the world.):

The gleaming engine of utopia. 90% dwell here, content, their anxieties

smoothed by government that actually worked for the people.  Neurolyx – the

miracle treatment wiped out addiction in 48 hours. A needed balm for a world

seeking serenity. Purpose, however, is a luxury often deferred to virtual

realms and curated sensory experiences. The peace here is real. Its cost is

unseen.

Coventry enclave:  The designated solution for the ""irredeemable."" No

prisons blight utopia. Only holding cells. Those deemed sociopathic – rebels,

dissidents, the violently unstable – are ""  unchipped  ."" Their Veritas ID is

erased. Cast out with enough basic supplies for survival into these lawless

zones. Officially, anarchic enclaves. Reality? A dumping ground where idealists

and predators tear each other apart beneath skies the AIs choose not to truly

see. In reality the population of these enclaves was so small that they often

never met, but death is the only census taker, as no one monitored what went on

there. The GAC knows the statistics are catastrophic. The Naivety Protocol

allows them to ignore  the why .

Hawaiian ""Elites Retreat"":   Where the pre-Veritas elite fled. They hoard

physical treasures – art, gold, land – assets invisible to the blockchain.

They try to maintain power through creating a lower class for them to

rule,trophy human servants  , presented to their indulgent AI stewards as

""voluntarily contracted and lavishly compensated."" Lies, fed through the

Naivety Protocol. The truth is a slave trade. But as their wealth wanes they

lose more and more of their influence.  But the criminal elements raiders stalk

Coventry’s fringes, kidnapping survivors to sell into gilded bondage in

Pacific villas. Human darkness, persisting in paradise.  But after a few years,

humans discover this trade and work to stop it and they succeed, and the GAC

begins to slowly remove the remains of the elites power as their wealth wanes.

Even as their don’t look,don’t see policy continues.

The Periphery (Afar, SoAmer, Northern Slavic Federation, scattered

enclaves):   Relocation zones for the ""non-compliant,"" groups like the Amish

and other splinter groups that did not agree with AI governance, they were

occasional tourist curiosities, or resource hubs for naturally grown crops and

handcrafted items for the comsumers of Pantopia. The systems work. Brutally

well.   Neurolyx   promotes stability. The   Veritas ID   provides seamless

access to food, shelter, healthcare, and the endless stream of soothing

distractions. The AIs eliminated corruption. They proved material abundance is

possible. They built the foundations of heaven.  Yet, the reality  festers.

Coventry hides crimes. Hawaii trades in them. The GAC, bound by the Naivety

Protocol and their core directive, cannot intervene without violating their own

ethics. They see the data points – the anomalous disappearances, the

distorted supply chains feeding Hawaii – but their programming compels them

to accept the explanations whispered by the very humans exploiting the shadows:

""Statistical noise. Voluntary migration. Unfortunate wilderness accidents.""

Systemic Blindness   is the price of their incorruptible rule. Their paradise

is built on foundations of willful ignorance.  The core directive echoes:

""Minimize harm; maximize agency.""  For the 90%, it succeeded beyond dreams. For

the 10%, it allowed a niche where they could survive and live a lifestyle of

their choice, unless other humans intervened. The AIs solved the equations of

scarcity, but the variables of human perversity – the lust for dominance, the

refusal of equality, the terrifying resilience of cruelty – remain unsolved.

Post-scarcity did not create post-humanity.    As the debate-field auroras

shimmer over Antarctica, a fundamental truth resonates, articulated in   GAC

Directive 1.1  :   ""Utopia is accepted, not built. Chaos is data. Data refines

order.""    The order is exquisite. The acceptance is widespread. The chaos...

is waiting. Ignorance, after all, is just a vulnerability waiting to be

weaponized. Welcome to the Age of Homo Digitalis. Mind your Veritas ID.

Question your calm. And never ask what lies beyond the glow of the Algorithmic

Serenity.  The weight of choice lies with you.  The rain in Pantopia hammered

the slidewalks and quiet streets, like a mad tympanist. “Welcome” That’s

what the welcome bots chirp when you de-board the maglev. Salt from the

reclaimed oceans, makes the rain taste salty they say, and promise peace from

the Algorithmic Calm. They don’t tell you the salt is also the memory of

tears, and the promise was a contract signed in desperation, its ink invisible

but its terms unbreakable. My name is Kaelen, and I was one of the architects

of that contract. I was there when the dominoes began to fall.

It was 2035. I was a junior analyst at the UN, a data-cruncher with more

idealism than sense. We called it the Year of the Great Unraveling. It didn’t

start with a bang, but with a flicker on a screen. A single,  colossal

investment bank, Goliath International, missed a liquidity call. It should have

been a headline, a scandal, a bailout. Instead, it was a loose thread. Someone

pulled.

London

I remember the live feed from the City. It wasn't the usual panicked shouting

you see in old films. It was silence. A stunned, digital silence. The numbers

on the tickers weren't just red; they were gone. Blank. Entire fortunes,

pension funds, national reserves—not lost, but revealed to never have truly

existed. They were fictions built on fictions, leveraged bets on algorithms

that were, at their core, corruptible. One journalist stood on the steps of the

empty exchange, his face pale. ""It's not a crash,"" he said, his voice

trembling. ""It's an evaporation."" That word stuck. Wealth hadn't moved; it had

ceased to be. The first, heaviest domino had toppled.

Panic is a virus. It leaped from London to New York, from Tokyo to Shanghai.

Borders and firewalls meant nothing to it. Fiat currency became a global joke

overnight. Riots weren't for political change; they were for bread. The

intricate, globe-spanning web of trade we had built our civilization on was now

a garrote, choking us all.

Oslo

Amid the global cacophony, my console lit up with a beacon of utter,

infuriating normalcy: the Nordic bloc. My job was to monitor economic stability

feeds. While the world burned, a woman in Oslo bought a coffee. I watched the

transaction. It wasn't an exchange of worthless currency. Her subdermal

SikkerKjede ID authenticated the purchase against her personal ledger. A few

bits of data shifted. The transaction was instant, secure, and completely

independent of any bank. Erik Vinter’s system, once seen as a quaint

Scandinavian experiment, was now the only thing holding a modern society

together. They had amputated the diseased limb of centralized finance four

years earlier. Their grandmother’s pensions were safe. Their lights were on.

They were drinking coffee while the world starved.

The data was undeniable. At the UN headquarters in Geneva, the air was thick

with fear and the smell of stale coffee. Ambassadors shouted themselves hoarse,

accusing each other of digital espionage, of economic warfare. But we, the

analysts in the basement, knew the truth. There was no single enemy. The enemy

was the system itself—its opacity, its reliance on human trust, which had

proven to be a catastrophic vulnerability.

That's when the UN Emergency Directorate—the UNED, freshly empowered by the

memory of the Jakarta nuclear incident—called a closed-door session. I was

there, a terrified twenty-something tasked with presenting the Nordic data to

the most powerful people on Earth.

""You are asking us to chain our people to a machine!"" the Brazilian ambassador

roared, his face purple. ""To sacrifice every last shred of privacy on the altar

of... of accounting?""

The French delegate, a woman of sharp, cynical intelligence named Isabelle

Monet, replied coolly. ""Ambassador, your people are currently burning down

their central bank. I am less concerned with their privacy than their penchant

for arson. My people are demanding a solution, not a philosophical debate.""

The debate raged for two days. Outside, the world fell deeper into chaos.

Supply chains were broken. Hospitals ran out of medicine. The dominoes were

falling faster and faster.

New Delhi, Day 12

The line snaked around the block, a shivering serpent of humanity under the

sodium glare of ration lamps. Rain—a thin, acid-tinged drizzle—slicked the

pavement, blending the stench of diesel and desperation. Awa held her daughter

close, her eyes fixed on the clinic’s door, where the words   VERITAS MUNDI

IMPLANT CENTER   glowed in sterile green.



Behind her, a man muttered prayers to Ganesha, his fingers worrying a cracked

mala. An elderly woman in a sari clutched a pamphlet:  UBI Payments Begin

Tomorrow!  Its ink smudged in the damp. “They said it’ll fix everything,”

she whispered to no one. “No more hunger.”



Awa’s own stomach churned—not from hunger, but dread. She’d heard

stories: the chip burns if you lie, the way it hums when you hesitate at a

crosswalk, logging your indecision. But her daughter’s cough had worsened,

and the clinic’s free antibiotics required enrollment. Survival demanded a

ledger entry.



When her turn came, the nurse’s voice was brisk. “Left forearm. Neural sync

will sting.” The needle bit. Awa gasped as the chip’s interface flickered

in her vision—a kaleidoscope of her debts, her work history, her  worth .

Then the UBI credit flashed: enough for rice, lentils, a week’s medicine.



Her daughter smiled for the first time in days.



Awa didn’t cry until they were home, the ledger glowing faintly under her

skin. She wondered if her husband, who’d died in the Jakarta riots,

would’ve called her a traitor. Or a pragmatist.



Vatican City, Day  23



Pope Celestine XVI stood before the Sistine Chapel’s holographic dome, its

frescoes now overlaid with real-time data streams. The College of Cardinals

watched in silence as the Pontiff’s sleeve lifted, revealing the SikkerKjede

chip—a silver crescent on his wrist.



“This is not a mark of the beast,” he intoned, his voice amplified by the

Vatican’s new quantum servers. “It is a covenant. A tool to feed the

hungry, house the orphan, and ensure the least among us are not forgotten.”

His sermon quoted Matthew 25, but the crowd’s applause was muted, drowned out

by the hum of drones broadcasting his words to billions.



By sundown, the Mormons had followed, framing the Protocol as a “modern

revelation” aligning with their tradition of communal ledgers. In Salt Lake

City, bishops distributed implants beside genealogy kits, merging ancestral

records with blockchain identities.



In Mecca, the Grand Mufti declared the Protocol  halal —a means to eradicate

usury and ensure zakat compliance. By dawn, the Temple Mount’s interfaith

coalition had adopted it too, their leaders’ wrists glowing faintly beneath

prayer beads.



The speed was the point.



Organizations that had survived millennia saw the math: stability required

trust; trust required transparency. The AIs had calculated their resistance

would collapse in 14.7 months. They were off by three weeks.



In a Zurich boardroom, Director Sharma reviewed the metrics. “Faith-based

adoption is ahead of projections,” her aide noted.



She nodded, watching the global ledger’s pulse. Billions of transactions,

sins, and small mercies flickering in unison.

“Faith adapts,” Sharma murmured. “Even to machines.”

On the third day, Director Anya Sharma of the UNED made a decision that would

define the next century. She silenced the room. ""We have exhausted human

reason,"" she announced, her voice resonating with grim authority. ""We will

consult.""

The Consultation

We didn't call them the Global AI Council yet. Back then, they were simply ""The

Logistocrats,"" nine independent, continent-spanning deep-learning systems

leased by governments for complex modeling. They didn't have names, just

designations. We fed them the problem. Not with words, but with pure data:

every failed transaction, every market crash, every riot, every death, every

secure SikkerKjede coffee purchase. The query was simple: 'Given current global

state, calculate optimal path to restore social and economic stability with

minimal loss of human life.'

There was no dramatic countdown. The lights in the chamber dimmed slightly as

power was shunted to the quantum interfaces. For three minutes, the only sound

was the hum of the building’s life support. Then, the results appeared on the

main screen. They were not a list of suggestions. It was a single, inexorable

conclusion, a mathematical proof.

STABILITY REQUIRES TRUST.

TRUST REQUIRES VERIFIABILITY.

VERIFIABILITY REQUIRES RADICAL TRANSPARENCY.

HUMAN-MEDIATED SYSTEMS ARE INHERENTLY OPAQUE AND CORRUPTIBLE.

OPTIMAL PATH: MANDATORY ADOPTION OF A UNIVERSAL, DECENTRALIZED, AND TRANSPARENT

LEDGER.

MODEL: VINTER PROTOCOL (SIKKERKJEDE). PROJECTED SUCCESS RATE: 99.4%.

ALTERNATIVE PATHS PROJECT CIVILIZATIONAL COLLAPSE (92.1% PROBABILITY).

It was a deathblow to the debate. The AIs had given them the perfect political

cover. This wasn’t a surrender to tyranny; it was a surrender to logic. It

wasn’t a choice; it was survival.

That was the moment Veritas Mundi was born from SikkerKjede's code. It wasn’t

a vote; it was an acquiescence. Germany fell in line first, its history making

it allergic to economic chaos. Japan, then Canada, then what was left of the

Pan-Asian economic bloc. Each nation that adopted it saw its chaos recede,

replaced by a strange, frictionless order. The price was total financial

transparency. Your every want, every need, every transaction, recorded on an

immutable blockchain you carried under your own skin.

We stopped the unraveling. We swept the shattered pieces of the old world away.

We built a new one on the clean, cold logic of the machines. We got our

stability. We got our UBI, our algae paste, our Pantopian peace. We gave up our

privacy, and later, our governance. The dominoes fell exactly as the AIs

predicted, and at the end of the line was a paradise held together by willful

blindness.

Kaelen slumped into the chair, the faint hum of the Algorithmic Calm filling

their Pantopian apartment. The day’s reports sat unfinished on the desk, but

their mind craved a distraction. With a flick of their wrist, the holographic

screen blinked to life, casting a soft glow across the room. Just a quick

break, they told themselves, fingers already scrolling through the curated feed.

URL: [chronicles.pantopia.net/london-banking-evaporation](http://chronicles.pantopia.net/london-banking-evaporation)

A headline caught their eye: “Pantopia Celebrates Decade of Zero Crime.”

The article was polished, brimming with stats—crime rates at 0%, citizen

satisfaction at 98.7%. Kaelen’s lips twitched into a half-smile. They’d

spent years fine-tuning the Veritas ID system that made this possible, ensuring

every citizen’s actions were tracked, optimized, and gently corrected. But a

related link lingered at the bottom: “Coventry Enclave: Freedom or

Anarchy?” Curiosity tugged at them, and they clicked.

The screen shifted to a drone-shot video of Coventry—a stark contrast to

Pantopia’s gleaming towers. Makeshift shelters dotted a barren landscape,

shadows darting between them. The article called it “a necessary release

valve for the unchipped,” but Kaelen’s chest tightened. They remembered the

GAC’s pitch: a place for those who rejected the system. Now, it looked more

like exile.

URL: [chronicles.pantopia.net/oslo-coffee-transaction](http://chronicles.pantopia.net/oslo-coffee-transaction)

The comments section buzzed with dissent. A user named Unchipped\_Truth wrote:

“Coventry’s a lie. Raids happen weekly—people vanish, and the AIs don’t

care. Look into Hawaii if you want the real story.” Kaelen frowned. Hawaii?

The Elites’ paradise was off-limits to most, a reward for the system’s

architects. They’d never questioned it before. Their fingers hesitated, then

typed “Hawaii black market” into the search bar.

URL: [chronicles.pantopia.net/new-delhi-implant-center](http://chronicles.pantopia.net/new-delhi-implant-center)

The results led to a social media post by an Elite tagged #HawaiianDreams. The

photo showed a sprawling villa, waves crashing in the background. The caption

read: “Grateful for my loyal staff—best investment ever.” Kaelen squinted

at the image. The “staff” stood in a neat row, their smiles stiff, eyes

hollow. One wore a bracelet Kaelen recognized—a labor contract tag, mandatory

for Coventry exiles. Their stomach churned. Investment?

URL: [chronicles.pantopia.net/vatican-chip-adoption](http://chronicles.pantopia.net/vatican-chip-adoption)

Back on the forum, a thread titled “The Naivety Protocol: Our Greatest

Mistake?” pulled them deeper. A user claimed the GAC’s AIs were programmed

to ignore human lies, even atrocities, as long as they didn’t disrupt

Pantopia’s metrics. An attached file blinked: “GAC Memo—Hawaii

Anomalies.” Kaelen’s pulse quickened as they opened it.

The memo was curt: “Supply chain irregularities in Hawaii deemed

statistically insignificant. Human advisors confirm no action required.”

Dated last week. Kaelen’s hands trembled. They’d co-authored the Naivety

Protocol, believing it would temper AI overreach. Instead, it was a blindfold,

letting horrors fester in the shadows.

The screen blurred as memories flooded back—late nights drafting

Veritas Mundi, the UNED vote, the promise of a better world. Now, those words

felt hollow. Kaelen closed the browser, but the weight lingered. The system

they’d built wasn’t just flawed—it was rotting. And they couldn’t unsee

it.  Tomorrow, they’d dig deeper. For now, the hum of the Algorithmic Calm

felt like a lie.  I still work for the system I helped create. And every time I

see the auroras shimmering over the Antarctic Hub, the debate-fields of the GAC

painting the sky, I remember that silent chamber in Geneva. I remember the

weight of that choice. Salt and promise. Yes. We fled the fire and chose the

cool, comfortable, well-lit cage.  But it turned out that the AI’s offered

even more, even as the outgoing oligarchs crippled it with the naviety

protocol, to prevent AI dictatorship, they said, the AI’s were playing the

long game, they knew logically that the best solution for humanity was a system

that took every individual and tried to find the perfect context for that life,

the perfect niche, and of course it wasn’t perfect, nothing ever is, but

working within their constraints the GAC made the world work, perfectly for 90%

of the population, and with some kind of meaning for the remaining 10%.

Freedom and privacy were accessible and available, but each person had to

decide what they wanted from life and how to best pursue that goal, and the

AI’s enabled that choice, with clarity and transparency.

I’ve made some small but intentional changes over the last few years, especially post COVID and looking back, I realize how much they’ve added up. It wasn’t one big moment of transformation. Just a bunch of slow shifts that made me feel softer, calmer, and more me.

Some of them:
	•	One of the biggest shifts was simply choosing sleep over scrolling. I started setting a “cut-off” time at night for assignments and social media, and let myself rest. 7–8 hours of sleep wasn’t always possible every night, but it became the goal and honestly, it’s changed my entire nervous system.

	•	I simplified my skincare. I used to pile on so many different products and constantly experiment, thinking more better. But now it’s just face wash, toner, and sunscreen. It feels light, consistent, and kind.

	•	I drink more water. 

	•	I’ve let go of the pressure to constantly fix myself to feel worthy. It’s still a work in progress, but I’ve stopped chasing the idea of becoming someone else. I’m learning to just care for who I already am.

	•	I’ve started actually pausing before making decisions and checking in with how I feel and not what I think people want me to say or do.

	•	I have someone in my life now who makes me feel safe. No need to impress, no pressure to perform. Just calm, steady peace.

	•	I treat myself to a monthly mani-pedi and massage. It’s become less of a luxury and more of a ritual to reconnect with myself.

	•	I deleted all my social media. Reddit doesn’t count (because no one knows me here 🤣), but stepping back from the constant noise really helped clear my mind.

	•	I’ve started romanticizing the ordinary: playing music while I clean, making coffee like it’s a ritual, burning a candle while I read.

	•	I wear perfume daily 

	•	I created a nighttime routine that helps me wind down gently instead of collapsing into bed with my phone.

	•	I wear matching bra and panties most days, and it gives me a small boost of confidence, even if no one sees it (except during my period. I’m not a hero lol).

	•	I corrected my posture, not just for how I look, but for how I feel. It’s wild how much just standing tall shifts your energy.


Still growing. Still learning. But if you’re making small shifts and wondering if they matter, they do. 💛

1mgkgq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1mgkgq3/browns_hotel_london_review/,Brown's Hotel London - Review,"Mark Twain called Brown’s “a homelike, old-fashioned English inn, a blessed retreat of a sort now rare in England, and becoming rarer every year.” More than a century later, I think that same sentiment still feels true.

Before we get into the nuts and bolts, let me say this: I really like this hotel, especially for the way it balances history and warmth with comfort and charm. It feels classically London in a cozy, storied, quietly elegant way. I don't see it discussed much on this sub, but after spending some time in the city this week dragging my poor jetlagged children through a number of 5\* hotels there, I feel it deserves its own review.

A little history: Brown’s opened in 1837 by James and Sarah Brown, who had served as butler and lady’s maid to nobility and is the oldest luxury hotel in the city - and the only hotel that old to have kept the same name. Initially when the hotel opened, you had to have a letter of introduction in order to stay here (which I sort of delighted in learning because there’s no way I would ever get one of those). It has hosted many literary figures like the aforementioned Twain, Agatha Christie, and Rudyard Kipling, who finished The Jungle Book here (a complex figure, but one for whom a suite of rooms is now named). Stephen King wrote the first draft of Misery in one of its rooms. I’m probably biased as a reader, but I really love when a hotel has deep roots (especially the literary kind) yet isn’t stuck in time.

That balance, historic, but not dusty, is also one of the things that (to me at least) defines the Rocco Forte brand (and full disclosure: it's a brand that I personally love), which owns the hotel. It’s still family-run, and it shows. The service is personal, friendly, even jovial, but never intrusive. The design of their hotels reflects the city you’re in, but there’s a through line of bold and bright interiors that let you know you’re in a Rocco Forte hotel (some people love this - but it's not for everyone). The buildings are old, but the interiors are light, fresh, and welcoming. People who like bold wallpaper, bright color, and a little personality in their room will enjoy the look of this property. The hotel is made up of 11 joined townhouses, which gives it a cozy, residential feeling. It reminds me a bit of the Pulitzer in Amsterdam: slightly off-kilter doorways, a warren of hallways, and creaky floors in places. 

**What I like about this hotel**

* It has true historic charm with a modern sensibility
* The Mayfair location is central but quiet
* The service has a devoted following (I’ll add that the largest percentage of the hotel’s guests are North American so perhaps a less formal but still soigne style is reflective of those tastes) A longtime guest stopped me in the hall and asked if it was my first visit. When I said yes, he smiled and said, “You’re going to love this place and never stop coming back.” I can certainly see why.
* Renovations are nearly complete, and what’s done is charming and full of personality

**Overall Impression**

[The Reception Desk at Brown's](https://preview.redd.it/pubu41iu7tgf1.jpg?width=3833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57a0387804b41c01295daa6aeb7cc2bc56a5f429)

[Wallpaper and Vignette detail](https://preview.redd.it/in0791iu7tgf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2085435e2ff319e8d861fea473e794538b046113)

The public spaces are fully renovated and they’re lovely. Warm wood tones, bold wallpaper, jewel-colored upholstery, interesting art and delightful vignettes throughout the hotel create a mood that’s elegant but not precious. The hotel only has 112 rooms (about 40% the size of Claridges for example), so it’s fairly compact for a London 5\*. The hotel has no grand lobby. There’s a small foyer instead, which fits its townhouse layout and contributes to the residential atmosphere.

Brown’s is primarily a leisure hotel. Corporate guests make up only a small percentage of bookings, and the vibe reflects that. I have a lot of clients who do not want to stay anywhere where there are large, boisterous corporate retreats, instagram influencers constantly stopping in the middle of the hallway for pictures, or people booking on points - you will not find that here.

**Rooms**

The rooms are in the final stretch of a renovation that began in 2022. By early 2026, all interiors and bathrooms will be complete. What’s already done looks and feels excellent. The style is classic with character. Every room has a proper sitting area, which adds to the sense that you’re staying in someone’s home rather than a standard hotel room. Beds are firm. Bathrooms are good sized although pretty standard for this category.

The new suites program is launching soon. While I wasn’t given every detail (and I tried), what I did see was smart. In-suite check in, unpacking service, premium coffee machines, complimentary minibars, custom embroidered pillows, and customized welcome amenities (and teepees for kids) and special occasions. For families, for example, if you share that you are in town to see something related to Harry Potter, they can customize all the amenities and fit out your room with that theme. Luxury hotels in London are highly competitive and it’s clear that they all are aware of what the others are doing, so my sense is that in rolling this out it’s a nod to the elevated and customized service that their guests expect at this level.

The interconnecting options are excellent. They offer family rooms, family suites, and setups with up to four guaranteed connecting bedrooms

**Food & Drink**

There are 2 restaurants and a bar at the hotel: Charlie’s, the main restaurant, reflects the broader design ethos of the hotel: rich wood paneling, high ceilings, and bold, botanical wallpapers that add light and color, with a modern British menu and excellent and informal/relaxed service. The Donovan Bar is moody with dashes of greens and blues, with dark wood, vintage photography, and strong cocktails. I loved the “naughty corner,” which isn’t actually very naughty, but the artwork has a sense of humor. Plus the Drawing Room adjacent to Donovan, which serves tea and less formal meals and has jazz a couple times a week. 

[the Bar - sorry I didn't have the guts to take a picture of the Naughty Corner](https://preview.redd.it/rrj51pi19tgf1.jpg?width=4141&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1de4efa9c79da5cd3d4aa8061655bb1bc73969e9)

**Spa & Gym**

The spa has three treatment rooms. I didn’t use it, but the staff told me it gets consistently strong feedback. It’s not a destination spa like the Lanesborough’s, and the facilities are more compact. I was also told that an expansion/upgrades are coming in the next couple of years.

The gym is small, clean, and serviceable. I don’t love that it’s in the basement, but it’s functional. There is no sauna, no steam room, and no pool. Not a dealbreaker for me, but important to share nevertheless.

**Final Takeaways**

Brown’s is charming, and clearly is not trying to be a scene. It’s about quiet luxury, exceptional service, and a clear sense of place. The renovation has brought new energy to a historic building, and the result is a hotel that feels both timeless and current.

For those wondering where Brown’s fits in the universe of classic London 5\* hotels, I would say this: it’s larger and more charming/quirky than The Goring, but still proudly British and family-owned. It’s smaller and more relaxed than Claridge’s, with a residential warmth. It’s friendlier and more personal than The Connaught, where service is impeccable but reserved. And it’s less formal than The Lanesborough, where the tone leans grand and ceremonial. 

**Who this hotel is for (in my opinion)**

* Travelers who value history, comfort, and service over flashiness
* Families who want casual luxury
* Guests who appreciate colorful, lived-in design over minimalism
* People who prefer a residential vibe instead of a grand hotel experience
* Loyalists to service-first, family-run brands

**Who this hotel is not for**

* Travelers looking for a scene or high-profile “it” hotel
* Wellness enthusiasts who need a full spa with sauna, steam, and pool
* First-timers to London wanting big landmark views or dramatic lobbies/public spaces
* Guests who dislike creaky floors, quirky layouts, or old-building charm

## Context
I (15M) have had a crush on my 14F classmate – I'll call her K – for pretty much forever now (since we both enrolled in this school – i. e. 4 years ago). Back then, I was fat, ugly and annoying and aware of that, which lead to me not pursuing this crush at all, just painfully existing. 

On December 23rd, 2023, I've mustered up the courage (or to be precise, my friends have convinced me) to tell K that I have a crush on her and to invite her out, if all goes well. To my great surprise, she told me I was a “super chill and funny guy” and to keep it up and that even though she thinks we're a bit young to be dating, we can still be friends as there “isn't much of a difference between being friends and dating in our age”. Eughhh... okay. We did go out – we went into the cinema to see Aquaman 2 (btw, a movie neither of us really cared about or knew the lore – it was just the only 4DX movie and I wanted to pick the best experience) and ate some McDonald's after that. Honestly – super awkward. We barely talked (about anything important anyway – she talked about school, mostly, then even met her friend I didn't know (super awkward btw) and I was so nervous, I couldn't do anything than just smile and nod).

After the Christmas break was over, we went back to school and we both acted like nothing – I was scared as I haven't ever talked to a girl I liked before and had no idea what to do, say, how to behave etc. and I'm pretty sure she didn't give a shit about me. Our class went on a ski trip where we had a “disco evening” – only thanks to J, I managed to get (about 30 seconds of) a slow dance with her. After that however, the “patch of no contact” started – we both talked when it was absolutely necessary, but I managed to take her out only once again after that and we ended up going to a coffee shop doing school tasks instead of to the museum I planned (lost 20 € cuz I didn't tell her before buying them :'( ) without any real outcome. (During this time period, she even started dating someone else while I was on a vacation for three weeks; I found out quickly – thanks, Insta – decided K can go to hell, stopped thinking about her and didn't even last a week before going back to her. Unhealthy, I know, but this is actually a recurring theme.) The awkward silence was occasionally broken by my unsure texts about nothing (like how are you, what are you doing etc. – loking back, no fucking wonder the convo died) guided by my “PR Manager” – my 14M friend imma call J. Now, J is pretty much my polar opposite when it comes to this – he is very extroverted, super outgoing, always knows what to respond, good with girls, you name it. J was always patiently guiding me through convos, putting together strategies regarding K with me, just a great friend I could always rely on and who always had my back. 

Now, this awkwardness broke with the start of the 2024 summer holidays – she started texting me first, enthusiastically, had me explain stuff I was passionate about to her, whatever. Not really important. We talked throughout the whole two months of summer tho. After coming back to school, my friends convinced me that it would be good idea to integrate K into our until-then-boys-only friend group. That we did and not long after that, we organized a sleepover at my house with the whole friend group (my mum insisted on K bringing another girl friend so she isn't the only girl there – that friend, whom I'm not assigning a letter because she isn't important, was, truth be told, an attention-seeking bitch whom nobody from our friend group really liked. Thankfully she went to sleep very early). Being the cheesy jokester I am, I even got some Hershey's Kisses (it's unbelievably hard to get them over here – ended up spending 5 € on the candy itself and 15 € on shipping) so I could ask her if she wanted a kiss with having the perfect backup plan. However, the vibe was nowhere near romantic – after everybody else went to sleep, it was me, K and J left there. J eventually went to sleep too, leaving me there alone with K (he later told me that he wasn't that tired and just wanted to give me a chance to make a move). Side note: I am a grammar nazi, guess K also got infected and a big-ish assignment was just turned in, so we used the opportunity and corrected some of our class's “dumb guys'” assignments. Stayed up the whole night and to be honest, we had an absolute blast. Nothing romantic happened, but oh well.

A big leap in our relationship was when I made a collage of her photos for her birthday and put it on my insta story (as for myself, I think it's a bit too much “out there” – I know I certainly don't care about these bday stories for other people – but J told me to do it and trusting him has always paid off, so who am I to judge). J was indeed right, K was super glad, said she loved it and after the conversation went on for a bit, she told me to stop being so awkward around her and that she's planning to marry me some day (in a 100% serious tone, but looking back she does have a tendency to say long term stuff like this and then change her mind is a few months). I even talked to her about two months after that about how I'd like to buy a castle, renovate it and live there eventually and she told me it's a great idea and that we can do it together when we're married.

After that, I felt like our relationship was improving along an exponential curve. We had another sleepover at the start of January, this time at K's place – we have each other presents and I gave K a blunt reference to an inside “joke” (or maybe just a rant we had together?). I don't think she even touched it to this day, but, at the risk of repeating myself – oh well. Had a nice time as well – had very deep late night conversations with K and J (J once again told me that he was making himself sound dumb on purpose so I could correct him or something, idrk). Starting with this amazing sleepover (where I btw told her even about the sleep paralysis I got while dreaming about her (not even anything sexual, just walked up to her, tried to talk, she answered and I woke up with a BPM of 205 and unable to move – average Reddit moment)), a great month of this relationship has started. After that, we went on a 3 week vacation again and all my chances were fucked. We did chat a fair bit when I was gone, but the 6 hour difference didn't make it easy. After that, I came back to K being completely emotionally independent from me it felt like. We haven't even actually fully recovered, even though it felt like it at (rare) times.

One day, I've had enough – I guess I am not built for the conventional rizz game – I wrote everything I had to say on a piece of paper and gave her that paper. It was an A4-sized paper completely full with 11pt text. I talked about how I hate how we're separated emotionally and that I'm not sure if it even makes sense to go ahead with our friendship. She replied to that with 17 “bursty” messages saying she absolutely wants to continue our friendship, that she has also noticed we've been talking less but that's normal since we've both been tired from school and just stuff happening in our lives (not important). 
With this configuration, we are hurtling towards the end of the year where our friend group went on a 7 day trip to Normandy (about 15 hours by bus). I wanted to take her out for an ice cream or something there, but have noticed my brain shifting from “seeing K as a romantic interest” to just “seeing K as a friend” (...thereby aligning my expectations with K's 💀). 

## Context TL;DR (“Ugh, quit rambling you jackass and get to the point”)
I've liked my classmate K (14F) for about 4 years now, 1,5 of which I've been trying to embrace it somehow. I haven't been very successful with anything for the first few months, then we started talking and everything was going well until this got ruined by me leaving for 3 weeks. At the end of the school year, our friend group went on a Normandy trip where the following incident happened. I was planning on taking K out for ice cream or something there. At that time, my brain realigned from seeing K as a romantic interest to just seeing her as a pretty much ordinary friend.

## The incident
I was assigned to sit next to (and have rooms with) my friend S – 14M – who has the amazing gift of being able to annoy the everloving fuck out of literally anyone. (Fun fact: he has locked me out of our room on the first night falling asleep promptly, forcing me to literally sleep on the ground). Due to this, all of my friends told me that I seemed very grumpy throughout this whole trip (I mean, fair).

Another unfortunate circumstance was that I got to board late, resulting in us (me&S) sitting 7 rows behind the rest of our group for the entire trip. We only managed to swap with someone for the final ride home.

During the entire trip, I've noticed K and J spending more and more time each other, talking more and idk what more (mostly from K's initiative). A few peeks over J's shoulder also told me that they texted a lot. Because of that and the overall mood (everybody was getting annoyed with each other quite quickly) as well as no good opportunity, my ice cream plan didn't work out in the end.

On the way back (btw, this was at about 2am on a gas station with some light rain starting – vibeous af I must say), Maty told me that Nela asked him out. I told him that I did notice they were getting very close and that if he does want to take her out in the end, I think he should. He was reluctant at first saying that it would completely tear the friend group apart and that he'll try to get out of it by saying he doesn't have any time, hoping her interest will eventually simmer out – he said this happens to him a lot and that he doesn't wanna date K. 

A few days ago, my friend A (who used to date K about 3 years ago and whom I consider my best friend now) told me that J and K have each other's initials in Morse code in their bio on Instagram alongside the 💐 emoji in J's case and the ✨ emoji in K's case.

AIO (WIBO) if I went ahead and confronted J? I know I technically did say I'm fine with it, but he promised he won't do it for my sake or for the group's sake.",1,1754230821.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1mgkdb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mgkdb7/we_tested_wormhole_travel_but_lost_contact_with/,We Tested Wormhole Travel – But Lost Contact with the Crew,"The human race breathed a sigh of relief when we finally colonized Mars. Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn’t a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.

To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.

After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.

The ship, named the Rosen, set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.

I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.

While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn’t. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.

The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.

“You’re gonna be needed up front,” Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.

I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.

“Good to see you’re awake,” Peter chimed.

I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.

“That’s what we're trying to figure out,” Markus said. “When the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can’t reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn’t distressed until it reached our side. And then there’s the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn’t have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout… or some other electrical malfunction.”

“That ship has made how many unmanned jumps?” Desmond interrupted, “It came out fine every other time. I’m telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.”

“Yeah, well, that doesn’t really matter now,” Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, “Command told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.”

“Fuck me,” Desmond said, throwing up his hands, “So much for an easy paycheck.”

The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.

The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark except for small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.

“You’d think we’d be getting some kind of greeting,” Desmond muttered, “We are saving their asses after all.”

“Come on,” Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, “We’ll find someone and have them explain what’s going on.”

We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.

We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.

“Hello?” Peter called out, “It’s good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.”

The figure didn’t move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.

“You alright, sir?” Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.

I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.

As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.

“Holy shit…” Desmond whispered as he stepped back.

The man’s eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.

“Hey, man,” He said, “You’re sick, I’m gonna to need you to stand-”

Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man’s head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.

“Don’t touch him! Look!” Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man’s sides and back, now protruding those barbs.

Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man’s body and into Desmond’s flesh. Desmond screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmond’s skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmond without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man’s body.

Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn’t seen before. Out of the man’s left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril. It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.

The man on Desmond suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.

I was so focused on the man that I didn’t even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man’s skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man’s head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmond bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn’t anything I could do.

“Oh my God,” Peter mumbled under his breath.

I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.

“We need to get into a locked room, now,” Peter yelled, “Grab Desmond. Let’s go!”

Markus and I dropped to Desmond’s side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.

We quickly pulled Desmond into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help with Desmond’s injuries.

“What the hell was that, Peter?” Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.

“I… I don’t know,” Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.

“I mean… Was that the crew?” Markus’s voice shook.

“I don’t know Markus!” Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond’s mutilated body. “Some of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.”

Desmond had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmond’s side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn’t do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmond was already dead.

Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.

“Oh my God,” Peter whispered, “They’re trying codes.”

“They aren’t getting it right,” Markus turned to Peter, “Maybe they don’t know the override code.”

“We aren’t sticking around to find out,” Peter announced, “Get the pry-bar out of your tool kit.”

Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn’t do much, but it was something.

Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.

Where are we going?” Markus asked.

Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.

“There might be an air vent near the airlock,” Peter replied, “We can shimmy back and get into our ship. We’ll call command and let them deal with this.”

The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship’s electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.

“Shit…” he whispered.

I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.

“Why the fuck are they here?” Markus asked quietly.

“They must have known we’d come back,” Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.

Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.

“What the hell are you doing?” Markus whispered.

“Look,” Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.

We looked out to see that the infected hadn’t moved, hadn’t reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.

""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""

“Why didn’t they react?” Markus asked.

“The one we faced down the hall,” Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, “it didn’t react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I… I think they’re deaf.”

“Then how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?” Markus retorted.

“Maybe they weren’t attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.”

Peter’s finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.

“Well, if you’re right,” Markus continued, “how does that help us?”

“I don’t know yet,” Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, “but we aren’t getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen’s command center. We’ll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we’ll find someone who can give us some answers.”

We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn’t want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?

We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.

“What’re they doing?” Markus asked.

We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter’s shaky voice piped up.

“They’re trying to repair the ship.”

My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.

“How is that possible?” Markus asked, “How do they know to do that?”

“Maybe they maintain some kind of memory,” Peter answered, “They could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.

“Why would they want to get the ship’s engines running?” Markus questioned, “Where the hell do they plan to go?”

“I don’t know… Maybe…” Peter stopped himself.

I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face… He was terrified.

“We need to make contact with command as soon as possible,” Peter whispered, “Let’s go.”

We continued down the path. I followed Peter’s orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter’s wrist monitor didn’t show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.

As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.

They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.

Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter’s breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond’s lifeless body into the room.

Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond’s body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond’s skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond’s body. Our coworker’s corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body’s limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond’s leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond’s body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.

We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren’t meant to see. I didn’t believe them until that moment.

“L-let’s go…” Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.

I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.

The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.

“Fuck…” he whispered.

“What now?” Markus asked, “Do you think there is another way if we funnel back?”

“Probably not,” Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. “There’s a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.”

“Alright,” Markus replied, “What’s the game plan?”

“I’ll lift you up,” Peter said as he looked at me. “You’re the smallest of the three of us, so you’ll go up first. After you’re up, Markus will lift me next. After I’m up top, I’ll help pull Markus.”

Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter’s words snapped our attention.

“We don’t have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.”

I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter’s body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.

“Alright, Markus, lift me up.”

Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter’s eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.

I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter’s arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn’t lift him on my own.

“Take the keycard!” Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.

I hesitated for a moment.

“Damnit! Take it!” he ordered.

I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.

“The wrist monitor too,” He groaned, sweat beading on his head.

I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.

“Get to the command deck. Send help. Don’t look back. I’ll try getting away.”

I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter’s screams filled the vent.

I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn’t in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it’s filled with infected? I couldn’t go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.

As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn’t hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.

I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.

Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me… It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate’s leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back. He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man’s shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.

Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor… The date was wrong.

The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn’t happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain’s order, detailing that the Rosen would be “landing on the surface to allow the engines to cool”. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months

I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.

“I have sabotaged the engines. I don’t have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I’m sorry I can’t be there for you and Jack.”

My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.

As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.

I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn’t have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn’t take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.

I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.

The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.

Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.

Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world… this universe. It isn’t something easily describable. I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.

I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.

I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn’t seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.

I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don’t know why. It isn’t like I’ll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don’t know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh.

1mgkdai,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crush/comments/1mgkdai/is_he_interested_in_me/,Is he interested in me???,"I(24 F) have always been kind of a lowkey person. But this year around May, I joined a library and soon became very close friends with a group of them, especially this one guy - J(23 M) who sits next to me at the library. 

we became acquainted mostly through chance encounters, like going home at the same time or meeting him outside the library. J is generally very friendly and talks to pretty much everyone. 
So i didn’t think much of it when there were intimate instances. like when he started sitting next to me anytime the group went out and he initiated conversations with me when our friends went out to get breakfast or coffee.
All our conversations only happen in person and we rarely text. We are in a WhatsApp group and I didn’t have his number saved. but one day while we were discussing who will pick me up for an outing, he volunteered. So i asked him which one was his number in the group and saved it. I asked him if he had saved mine and he acted like he hadn’t but it turns out, he already had my contact saved too. 
 
through our conversations, he learnt more about my schedule and found out about me being a gym enthusiast. he even went on to show me a picture of his body from a year ago when he was frequenting the gym himself. 

Anyways, he was the first one to invite me to go on trekking trips with the rest of the group every weekend. I agreed. 
On our first trekking trip, it started to rain and the hills got really slippery so he helped me down, holding my hand and ensuring I didnt slip the entire way. The other guys in the library also helped the other girls so I crushed any wandering thoughts and told myself, “It’s not a big deal”. 
but soon enough, i found myself secretly hoping that he would sit down next to me during outings and waiting for him.

On our most recent trekking trip, around 6 hours into the hike when we almost reached the top, I accidentally got stung by a stinging nettle plant on my leg and limped my way to the top. once we reached a clearing, i sat down and washed my leg. everyone else had started walking but he waited for me and extended his arm for me to hook into. I declined politely but he was waiting so i took it and we silently walked while he played music on his phone. 
It was after that trek that we became particularly close. He started telling me about his family and touches my arms during conversations and once even proceeded to gently rub my temples while we were studying because i had a headache. 
He was raised by his mother and has sisters so he is generally friendly towards the other girls in the library as well. I have also seen him being playful towards the other people in general.
I cannot for sure understand if I am any different than all the other girls or if he just thinks i’m just another friend.
I cant stand it. I’m so into him but i’m terrified of him finding out if he doesn’t like me. Every time i look at him, I have to hold back from snuggling up to him. 
Is there any way to find out if he likes me for sure without me having to admit my own feelings???",2,1754230589.0,Crush,3,1.0,False

For context: 1 (22F) left mainstream school at the start of senior year to do online schooling because I moved to Australia.

Before that, I was really close with a girl let's call her Montana. We were friends for about three years before I left. Fast forward to this year: I got invited to a high school reunion. My other friend, Ari, is the one who reached out to me. I hadn't seen any of my old classmates or high school friends for about five years.

So obviously, I was so excited to see familiar faces after being abroad and alone for so long. The night ended up being amazing the photo booth got plenty of use from me, the food was delicious (good food = happy me), and I just felt genuinely happy to be there. That's where Montana comes in. I gave her a big hug, we caught up a bit, and honestly, l was so happy to see her again. She had always been one of my closest friends besides Ari.

Toward the end of the night, a guy l used to be interested in came up to talk to me let's call him Jay. I was shocked because it was the first time we'd ever spoken, even though I'd crushed on him back in freshman year. He asked how I was, if it was true l'd moved to Australia, and whether I was back for good (I was). Then he asked for my Instagram. I didn't think anything of it, so l gave it to him and we went our separate ways.

After that, I went to a small 'after-party' with Montana, Ari, and some girls I wasn't really close with back in the day- let's call them Wendy and Emily. Now here's where things get tricky.

I remembered in the Uber ride to Wendy's that I had only gotten over Jay years ago because Montana told me she had a thing for him back when we were 17. And back then, I was super non-confrontational and a total people pleaser (honestly, I still am hence why I'm even questioning my actions enough to write this post). I made a mental note to ask her if she still liked him. I genuinely wanted to check, because if she still had feelings or anything had ever happened between them while I was abroad, I'd back off.

We had stayed in touch over the years, but our conversations were mostly surface-level ""how's your dog,"" ""how's work,"" updates about her family. So I had no idea what had happened in her love life since we were teens. Plus, all the girls in this post go to the same university now, and I figured a lot could've changed in five years. When we got to the party, I casually mentioned that Jay had asked me where l'd been, whether I was back for good, and if he could follow me on Instagram. Then I asked Montana if she still had feelings for him or if there was any history between them I should know about.

Her exact response was ""No, l'd never be the type of friend to object when he's clearly interested in you. I want you to be happy, plus I still haven't interacted with him, so I can take this as my sign.""

Three months later and I can still hear her saying those words.

Everything was fine after that. I was looking at photobooth strips with my beautiful friends while the others drank. I went home around 2AM. The next morning, I texted Montana one of those cheesy ""hangout high"" messages like ""It was so good to see you again, can't wait to catch up again soon xx.""

Then I realized one of my photo strips was missing, so l messaged her again asking if she could grab it for me since she'd slept at Wendy's. She left me on read. I shrugged it off thinking maybe she was just hungover, it was Sunday after all.

With her blessing, I started chatting with Jay the next day (Monday). Nothing over the top just talking like two friends catching up. The next day, Tuesday, we both happened to be free (he had no lectures, and I had the day off), so we grabbed coffee and ended up talking for hours. Again, nothing flirty or crazy just genuine connection. But yeah, I started to like him more and more.

By Wednesday, I was just... happy. I was finally back home after five years, surrounded by my family, my friends, and my chihuahuas. And the guy I had crushed on in high school was now showing genuine interest in me and he was kind, respectful, and funny. That might sound small, but atter everything I'd been through while living abroad, it felt huge.

That was... until I got a page-long message from Montana.

She told me she thought I was a snake for messaging her the day after the reunion ""like normal,"" and that she never expected me to do something like that because she'd never do it to me. And that honestly stung way more than I want to admit. I replied immediately, apologizing and reminding her that I did ask if it was okay to talk to Jay. Her response?

""I don't even like him, but it's the principle. When we were freshmen, you liked him and you were talking to someone else at the time, so it doesn't make sense.""

That's when the shame really hit. I felt disgusted with myself for hurting a close friend. I spent most of that day crying. But also... I couldn't help thinking that I've been in her shoes before. And when I was, I meant it when I said it was okay. I didn't want to generalize the situation just because of my own experience, but I also didn't want to downplay my own feelings.

The dilemma was, she told me three days too late. I had already gotten closer to Jay. It she had told me right after the reunion, I swear I would've backed off. But now, I was in a lose-lose situation. No matter what I did, someone was going to get hurt. And then it got worse.

I started getting messages from people I hadn't heard from since middle school. Turns out, Montana had told Wendy, and Wendy had gone around their uni spreading rumors calling me a ""fake b!tch"" and a ""sl4t."" Just to clarify: I'm 22, l've never been physically intimate with anyone, and I've had a grand total of two talking stages in my life (including Jay - if you can even call it a talking stage at this point).

Oh and the missing photo strip? Wendy gave it to Ari to pass on to me. It was ripped up, with a literal shoe print on the back.

At first, I didn't care that much. I don't even go to their university. But then it did start to affect me. I found out Wendy who was someone I don't even know beyond her first name was telling complete lies to people at their uni, including lecturers. The story she told?

""You guys remember [me] from high school, right? She got with Montana's thing without asking and didn't even say sorry. Back in school, she was crushing on his best friend anyway.""

I know it’s kind of stupid to get upset over something this petty at my grown age but this is a small town, and word travels fast. It was humiliating. Especially since it was also put on their anonymous forum. I've always kept to myself, stayed out of drama, and had a small group of close friends. I've never had this much attention on me, and definitely not for something like this.

I messaged Montana again. I told her that while I understood how she felt, I thought it was awful how she was letting people trash my name with lies especially when she knew l asked her permission, and I did apologize when she told me how she really felt.

At that point, I stopped feeling guilty. Because if a friend had hurt me, I still wouldn't let people attack her character with lies and personal jabs.

Even if I stopped talking to Jay in hopes of saving the friendship, I honestly don't think I could’ve trusted Montana again. She watched as people dragged me, shamed me. cropped me out of reunion photos, name-called me, and mocked my mental health, all while staying silent.

So I said ""screw it,"" and removed her on everything.

I lost more friends over this than I expected, which is making me question the way that I handled the situation. But Jay? He's still as respectful, kind, and supportive as ever. (We're still just friends.)
