1fx4pqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1fx4pqj/tshurricane_milton/,TS/Hurricane Milton,"For those of you who haven't been on the internet today... we've got another storm cooking in the gulf. Official forecasts at nhc.noaa.gov. I'm not a met, so I'm not gonna sound like one. 

Per the prep thread over at r/tropicalweather (https://old.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1fwwaw5/milton_preparations_discussion/?cache-bust=1728174330212), store shelves in Florida are being wiped out. The good news is that people are taking this one seriously. The bad news is.... Tampa does NOT need more rain, and most of the debris from Helene haven't been picked up yet. 

This goes without saying... if you're not already prepped, please do so. You don't need to buy out all the TP at Costco in order to be ready. In no particular order, my hurricane prep list involves: 

1, cleaning the house
 - Clearing the floors of all dog/kid toys. Ever stepped on a lego during a power outage? 'Nough said 
2, washing every last dish and scrap of laundry. It's a lot easier to go a few days without utilities if you start caught up on laundry 
3, food prep. Pre-cooking something that can be eaten cold, or prepping meats to grill while you still have running water to clean prep surfaces can be beneficial. I usually brew about a gallon of coffee. I like to purchase packaged healthy snacks - watch the sugar content - and counter-stable fresh fruits. Apples can last up to a month without refrigeration. 
4, Water. You don't need to buy a pallet of bottled water. Use existing pitchers/containers and fill them with tap water. I like to keep a few of the $2 plastic pitchers from Walmart on hand - so much cheaper than buying disposable water bottles. If you're planning on drinking said water, make sure the containers are clean ahead of time. If you have plastic totes, those also work well for storing toilet-flushing water. I personally don't like to fill the bathtub, as I find that it usually leaks. I will, however, put 2 or 3 plastic totes IN the tub and fill those instead. 
5, make a shelter-in-place bag. This has a pair of work gloves, hard hat/bike helment, a days' worth of food/water, etc. This is what I need within arms reach during the worst of the storm. I keep my ID card on me at all times, too. 
6, make a go-bag. This would be in case I have to leave the house rapidly. This would include important documents, cell phone chargers, a few irreplaceable family heirlooms, etc. Basically a refugee bag at that point. 

Also - reach out to your family members outside the area and make a communications plan. I have ONE sibling that I keep updated, and they keep the rest of my family updated. If there is a situation bad enough that people are marked as missing, having a last-known-update is helpful.",1,1728175514.0,preppers,0,1.0,False

1fx4mjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1fx4mjg/my_gerd_recovery_journey/,My GERD Recovery Journey,"My background : I've experience acid reflux for more than 15 years. My doctors first diagnosed me to have an unnaturally high acid production due to working in a highly stressful environment. I am an IT consultant, system architect and lead SysOP in an SMB, requiring me to have an unnatural sleep cycle, be ready 24/7 to assist and lead my team when trouble occurs in the system/network.

I have had GERD on and off, the hardest one was when I first had it 15 years ago, I was clueless, had a panic attack, having trouble breathing and thought I was on imminent death before rushed to nearest hospital where the doctor immediately gave me PPI, H2 blocker and put me on oxygen mask. It took my roughly 1 year to fully recover at that time. (I was prescribed omeprazole 40 mg + antacid)

A few years after that, I was experiencing the same symtoms again and this time I was more prepared, I always had omeprazole, h2 blocker (famotidine) and antacid with me 24/7 and whenever a symtoms happen I took all 3 immediately. Up til now I'm still experiencing some episodes but it is a lot manageable, and it doesnt take much time for me to recover (roughly 1 month is all I need), here is how I did it:

When an episode first happened, I immediately take 40 mg esomeprazole / nexium + 20 mg famotidine + antacid (calcium carbonate);

For the following 2 weeks I took 40 mg esomeprazole before dinner, and then split the famotidine into 10 mg x 2 times per day, one before breakfast and one before sleeping in the evening, and take the antacid and domperidone only when I feel the need, usually antacid in the evening before bed to eradicate all excess acid and domperidone when I feel nausea. I also use the 30 degree wedge pillow at all time. (I have the 45 degree but according to my smart ring, I have a much better sleep quality with the 30 degree one), I also have braxidin (Chlordiazepoxide HCl + Clidinium Bromide) and a Prebiotic+Probiotic tabs to help me with IBS, as for some reason my gut biome always goes crazy when there's too much acid in the stomach. I always takes prebiotic+probiotic tabs in the morning when my stomach is empty, usually an hour before breakfast.

After the first 2 weeks, for the next week I usually feel a lot better and start reducing my esomeprazole to 20mg/day, still same, taken at the evening before dinner. The rest of the meds are exactly same (2x famotidine 10mg and prebiotic+probiotic tabs daily; whereas antacid, domperidone and braxidin taken as needed).

3rd week I further reduce the esomeprazole into 10mg/day

4th week I stop taking esomeprazole and only do the famotidine 2 times a day

5th week I stop taking PPI and H2 blockers, and only do the prebiotic+probiotic daily. Still taking antacid before sleeping to take care of any excess acid, but that usually stop at around 6th or 7th week and by that time I no longer need any medication and everything is fine.

This is how I took care of GERD for the last few years, I hope this will help someone else out there.

Note : During these 6 weeks of recovery, I do a split protein diet (splitting proteins into smaller portion like 10g/meal to help reduce strain on my digestive system) and stop drinking coffee, which I usually drank about 2 cups/day. But after fully recovered I do not do any diets at all and everything will stay fine.

I also plan to retire from my current position and go do something else, I am aware that my current stressful environment does not help me at all and will cause my GERD to recur again sometimes in the future.",0,1728175223.0,GERD,0,0.5,False
1fx4ma1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fx4ma1/husband_upset_he_didnt_get_a_birthday_blow_job/,Husband upset he didn‚Äôt get a birthday blow job AITAH?,"
We have been married 10 years, 3 children under 5. The blow jobs have been less - I never liked doing them , but I will give him a blow job every so often and we do 69 and have sex I would say twice a week on average. 

My sex drive since having kids has reduced massively. It really takes me a lot to get in the mood. 

He is a great dad and husband, helps around the house. 

I‚Äôm always so tired, work, kids and life. That combined with my low sex drive means I really don‚Äôt give him blow jobs often which dissapoints him. 

What I‚Äôm struggling with is that when he doesn‚Äôt get one he goes off in a mood. Which will last half a day/ hours until he admits he is grumpy as he didn‚Äôt get a blow job. In that time I ask if he is ok, does he need a sleep, coffee racking my brain to think of what I‚Äôve done wrong or what‚Äôs made him mad. 

I‚Äôm just so fed up with this behaviour.

Latest one is it was his birthday nearly 2 weeks ago. I got him a cake and presents, but he was mad as I never gave him a blowjob.  I have been super busy at work, kids sick and I‚Äôve just not been feeling it so he hasn‚Äôt got his bj yet for his birthday. He has spent all day today grumpy with me because of it (2 weeks later) as he says he is disappointed it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. 

I feel I cant live with someone who puts this much weight on bj. I feel like I‚Äôm in my right to say no. But I can‚Äôt deal with (what I feel is) this teenage behaviour. 

We are obviously sexually incompatible. But I don‚Äôt think this is enough to divorce. I love him so so much and I think he loves me. I‚Äôm just really struggling with his behaviour when he doesn‚Äôt get what he wants. 

Should I just suck it up (literally lol), marriage counselling? I feel at loss and really upset with his behaviour. (Which he thinks is reasonable)

I have inattentive and hyperactive ADHD, as well as generalized anxiety to top it off. I truly hate being someone who complains because besides all of this, my life is going really well. But man it's just fucking hard sometimes.

I'm genuinely just so stressed out and I tried to do everything ""right"" today. I'm a college student taking 3 classes, one requirement that I am currently retaking and that has nothing to do with my degree (I'm a psych student, and it's geology) which has been the bane of my existence to both myself and also my nearly 4.0 GPA. I'm incredibly grateful that I am in college, but I have not had a break in over two years. Needless to say, I am burnt out. 

It's been painstakingly hard to study at home so I decided I would head to the Cafe today and take my meds **beforehand** so I didn't get hyperfixated on something else. I chose not to bring my sweater as it's annoying to carry, thinking it would be warmer in the Cafe but they're literally blasting AC in cold ass weather for whatever reason.

I had to use 3 methods to remove it and it's still not entirely gone, and I can't throw it in the wash because I have to refill my laundry card (the laundry card machine is broken unless I travel, and I need to go to the ATM first which closes early). I get stuck in paralysis just thinking about it. 

I planned to buy myself crochet supplies after studying all day as a gift to myself, but it's already the evening and I've got nothing done. I have an exam in 5 days I have barley studied for and I'm pretty sure I failed my lab test the other day despite putting in the effort. I have no time for myself and when I do I'm just too tired to do anything. And tomorrow I have plans in the evening and knowing my ADHD, I'm going to sit around until then and not do any work.

Because of that I am leaving this here because I'm unsure where else to put it.

A friend and I were hanging out today in Cincinnati on Vine Street when we went into a clothing store because she wanted to look at some stuff. At one point we ended up in the back of the store then decided we were done and wanted to leave. I begin to walk to the door when a shoe from a display stand in the middle of the store simply just flew up over the shoe next to it and then landed right in front of me from just out of nowhere. It literally ""jumped"" over the shoe that was right next to it and landed right at my feet. I laughed and started to pick it up, my friend said ""how the fuck did that happen?"" and the cashier working at the time said something to the effect of ""that was wild, I just saw that shoe jump at you."" I picked it up and put it back on the display stand and laughed it off, as I kept walking out I made a joke about how it must have been Henry the ghost and we went on our way.

Later in the afternoon we stopped at a coffee shop and when we sat down we reflected on it some more and realized how we brushed off something that we had no explanation for whatsoever and realized how weird it is. Now I can't stop thinking about it because it was so odd. I have the urge to go back to the shop and see if they maybe have security camera footage that hopefully captured the event because I'd love to know if we all just missed something obvious happening or if it really was just as odd of an event as it seemed.

We can't think of any explanation at all. There was no fishing wire on the shoe for them to use as a prank, I picked the shoe up and placed it back on the stand. The stand was not lopsided, it was perfectly flat. The stand was not in an area where a draft would have affected it and there was no draft in the store anyways, the door was just open at all times and there really wasn't any wind or air flow in or out of the store or a pressure difference. The stand I guess could have had a mechanism in it to launch the shoe? But it's a small stand and I saw nothing like any separations where a part could have come out to act as a flinging mechanism. There's literally no logical explanation for this and the more I think about it the weirder it gets.",4,1728174310.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False
1fx4ah2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fx4ah2/tell_me_your_thoughts_on_this/,Tell me your thoughts on this,"I (27 M) was approached by a girl (21 F) at a coffee shop a few months ago. We exchanged numbers and made dinner plans, which she canceled and said she just wanted to be friends. Nothing much came of it, just casual text talk, until one conversation I told her I was leaving for a week to go to Marrakech for a work trip. When I got back from this trip, she texted me and asked to get coffee. We meet up, chemistry is great, and a ton of mutual interests. We make plans again for the following weekend, which she completely stands me up on, and ghosts me on text. 

Fast forward two weeks, she finds me on instagram, follows me, and gets my attention by liking all my posts. I give in, message her, and she says she wants to see me again. I brought up the ghosting, and she said she wasnt really ghosting me but just ‚Äúleft reality for a bit‚Äù. Against my better judgement, I meet her for a drink. It goes great again, Im starting to like this girl. Two days later she comes over, I make us dinner, and we watch her favorite movie, Buffalo 66, and get very intimate, but held off on sex. She invites me to her friends comedy show the following week, and leaves around 2 AM. I offered her to stay the night but she wanted her own bed before work at 5 AM, shes a barista. 

The next day I follow up to get the date for the comedy show so I can request off from my part time bartending gig. She doesn‚Äôt answer, a couple days go by and I follow up a few more times, and no answer. 

I end up sending way too many texts, hoping she wasn‚Äôt ghosting me again, over about a week‚Äôs time. She never answers, yet still follows me on instagram and views my posts/stories. 

Im wondering what peoples thoughts are on her? Did I blow my chance with a person I really liked by not holding off on extra messages? Or was this doomed from the start. I‚Äôve been beat about it because I genuinely liked in person, and felt so comfortable and myself with her, which I haven‚Äôt experienced since my first serious relationship.

1fx499t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fx499t,Momo just became my favorite slime shop of all time,"Oh. My. GOD! I ordered these two beautiful slimes from Momo‚Äôs shop last Sunday. Up til this point, I had to wait at least 2-3 weeks for my slimes to show up when ordering from other shops. Momo‚Äôs showed up in UNDER a week. This impressed me right off the bat. Not to mention the adorable holographic package and squishy toy! But these slimes‚Ä¶ oh my LORD these slimes‚Ä¶ I am admittedly rather new to the hobby. This is my fourth time ordering slimes period. But even though I have a relatively small collection compared to some on this subreddit, the quality of these two beauties was beyond self evident. I will elaborate more on these two slimes below


Coffee grounds: This was the first slime I opened out of the package. I just got home from a 12 hour day of wiping butts (gotta love that CNA life) and desperately needed a mood boost. The first thing I noticed was how packed this container was. Not a molecule of air was present; just pure slime. This immediately gave me good vibes. After I opened it I just had to smell it right away. And y‚Äôall. Y‚ÄôALL. When I say this slime smelled so dark and strong and almost chocolatey from how rich the coffee scent was. The scent is simply INTOXICATING. I don‚Äôt even like coffee that much, but it took all the will within me to not brew a pot on the spot. But this is not to even mention the texture! Most slimes I have ordered from other shops have arrived slightly melted and needed a bit of activator. Well not with this slime. This baby came out the package raring to go. The texture is described as a snow fizz. This is my first snow fizz slime and I am immediately in love with this texture. So satisfyingly crunchy and bubbly, feels like a sugar scrub on my hands. I will definitely be trying out this texture again next time I see it pop up in her shop. Overall, 10/10 slime and highly recommend for any coffee lovers out there, or even people who are mid on coffee like me. This slime singlehandedly raised my bar on all future purchases from any shop.


Tennis ball: and secondly is the slime that was my entire reason for making this order (the coffee slime was an impulse buy lol)! The first premium slime I bought this year was Kawaii Slime Company‚Äôs Fairy Garden cloud slime. While I found the slime to have a pleasant scent and appearance, the overall texture left a lot to be desired. I was hoping for a more drizzly cloud, but instead ended up with a more holdable and stiff cloud dough. After doing some research on good clouds I saw Momo‚Äôs shop popping up a lot as a recommendation. I knew I would have to get a cloud from her next restock and, after seeing the very unique concept behind this slime, decided to give it a shot. I was a little worried about the scent being too strong/rubbery when I purchased it, but upon arrival I am happy to say those worries were totally unfounded. The scent is a wonderful clean scent with a mild aroma of tennis balls. I also have to mention the absolutely adorable charms that come with this slime. The tennis racket and ball are just so cute and I don‚Äôt even care about tennis! Right away after pulling this slime out of the container I realized what I had been missing in my previous cloud slime. Within literally 2-3 stretches it was drizzling like a dream. Once again, Momo has sent my bar for premium slime quality into the atmosphere. Easily another 10/10 perfect slime.


In conclusion, Momo is my new slime god and I will be worshipping her daily, as should you. Can‚Äôt wait to check out future restocks!",5,1728174040.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

I find this machine really interesting, Ive spent quite a bit on espresso equipment and have landed my endgame setup, I don't see any need to upgrade. That said, I have enjoyed what pourovers Ive tried at coffee shops and we have a Moccamaster at home.


The xBloom seems appealing because I don't really have the desire to learn a new brewing skill/technique and the idea of throwing in some beans, walking away and coming back to a nice filter coffee is intriguing. A couple of things give me pause, one is that no where in Australia sells the pods yet as far as I can see. My current grinder is a Lagom P64 with the Mizen Omni burrs, I feel like I'd be getting more out of that than I would the with the xBloom grinder (which does seem to be very good to be fair).


I guess the question is, would I potentially be getting a significantly better cup of coffee out of the xBloom compared to the Moccamaster? Would a pour over be a vastly different drink from something out of a batch brewer? If someone already has a good grinder and the pods aren't available in the country anyway, would something like the Fellow Aiden be a better option?

I also had a coffee 3 hours before the fight.
I was also expecting to fight a bit harder than I did.

1fx45o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1fx45o1/fat_roommate_is_driving_me_crazy/,Fat roommate is driving me crazy.,"Hello everyone I just wanted to talk about my little or probably not that little experience with a fat roommate that is completely driving me crazy and making me feel so desperate. 

The thing is that I‚Äôm currently seasonally working in the U.S (I‚Äôm not american) in the hospitality industry, my employer offered housing for a reasonable monthly price and I thought it was a good idea taking it, since if you live here, they also give you the job site transportation at not cost, so I chose to take it. 

The hell started from the very first day I just got to the apartment, I didn‚Äôt know I was gonna be assigned to a roommate but I really guessed it was gonna happen since this is not the first time I worked in this industry with this kind of contracts and also got roommates on my previous jobs, so having roommates is not bad for me at all, but the bad thing was when I just opened the door for the first time, the first thing I saw was a fat guy (probably 275lbs - 300lbs) in the kitchen preparing his dinner, I don‚Äôt wanna be mean or judge fat people but is well known that is reallyyyy hard to deal with them, specially because they tend to be kinda dirty and lazy when it comes to clean. 

Well, for my bad luck, that‚Äôs all this guy is and even worse, he‚Äôs completely lazy, dirty, disrespectful and has a really bad smell which he doesn‚Äôt really care if you feel uncomfortable or not. We also have another roommate who‚Äôs more understanding and helps you clean and that, he‚Äôs very friendly and such a nice person, but the fat guy is completely driving us hell crazy. This other guy already lived with him last year because they came to this same company to work and they were assigned together to be roommates last year too, so he knows him very well. 

He‚Äôs always coming back from work at 3:00am - 5:00am, since he works for the same company but in a different place/position, so almost every time he comes, he always shuts the door so hard, that hard to wake us up, he starts cooking, shutting fridges door really hard and making a lot of noise in early morning (3:00am - 5:00am), since he‚Äôs a fat guy, the only thing he thinks about is eating, even if we already told him to be more quiet and let us sleep, all he says is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna starve just because you wanna sleep‚Äù like WTF bro. 

Another thing that bother us, is the fact that our bathroom looks like an old bar bathroom, completely nasty with a lot of hairs on it, since this guy always gets haircuts in it and never cleaning it properly, I literally had to get my toothbrush outta there because he throws hairs everywhere and doesnt care if he does it on your stuff. We tried to talk to him and tell him to clean the bathroom one of us every week, and he refused by saying that he always clean it when he actually DOES NOT. When I wanna take a shit, I literally have to go to the hotel which is crossing the street because there‚Äôs not fcking way I‚Äôm gonna use ours, because is nasty as hell and smells like his corporal smelling. Luckily that hotel is part of our hotel chain that we‚Äôre working for so they never told me anything for going to use their public bathroom. So we decided to just leave the bathroom like that to see if he cleans it someday and it‚Äôs like 2 months since that thing was cleaned for the last time (by myself).

Our apartment is really small, is just a 1 bedroom apartment with a small kitchen in the middle and then the living room, me and the other guy are sleeping and have our beds in the living room and he got the room for himself alone, we dont feel that bad for it because there‚Äôs no way in this world we gonna share same room and sleep next to this fat guy because he‚Äôs always farting, burping, also his corporal and feet smell are disgusting. When he‚Äôs off he somedays doesn‚Äôt even take a shower, even when he has to go to work, he goes without even taking a shower or just brushing his teeth, so you all could imagine how bad and dirty his room is because he NEVER cleans it, so for us living in the living room, we can feel that bad smell coming out of his room to the point that our clothes smells like him, or sometimes getting food smell because he‚Äôs cooking and eating like 5 times a day.

His routine is like:

1- coming from work at 4:00 AM just to cook.

2- Getting up at 8:30 AM and cook breakfast.

3- Cooking lunch at 11:30 AM.

4- Cooking or getting snacks and coffee at 3:00pm or 4:00pm.

5- Cooking and having dinner at 7:00pm.

6. Cooking his food to take to work at 8:00pm and sometimes eating a second dinner. 

He‚Äôs like everything in his head turns around food and eating, he would never care if you are completely exhausted and wanna sleep, he would cook and make a lot of noise, and if you get mad and tell him to be quieter he would get mad and do it even worse just on purpose. When he‚Äôs not working and is at home, he leaves his freaking bedroom door opened with his TV turned on with a high volume, talking by phone or laughing so loud, and feels like if he does it on purpose just to make you feel bad and no matter what time is it, he would still do it. 

When it comes to the kitchen, he never bought a single dish soup or just pass a rag to clean the stove after cooking, even the floor he sometimes leaves it with a lot of food leftovers and would never sweep it. 

We‚Äôre all from the same country and tried to talk to him but he always gets mad and then starts doing some more crazy and stupid shits just to keep bothering us.

There‚Äôs also a lot of shocking things he does because he‚Äôs one of the most stingy people I have ever met on my life, to the point to wear used underwear he finds at his work site. 

If you try to talk to him and show some dissatisfaction with his way of doing things or acting, he just does not care and would never listen to you, all he care about is eating and eating his walmart disgusting food. Sitting down inside his room and eating worse than a hungry stray dog. 

I am so sorry if I wrote a lot but I really wanted to get all this shit from inside of me, since this guy got me so desperate now. It‚Äôs been almost 4 months putting up with this situation to the point of making me ask for an early departure back to my country since I can‚Äôt stand with him anymore, so i‚Äôm glad that this gonna be over in 2 weeks. 

Do yourself a favor, never live and try to live with fat people, their lives are a disaster.

I'm a 25f, I'm at 187 pounds, 5 feet.
Since I was a little girl I've been on the task of losing weight, and had a very strict diet of very few and boring meals when I was 15 (breakfast was a boiled egg with black coffee, dinner was half a tuna can and pineapple).

Since I have memory I've always needed to lose weight, and I lost it at 15 yrs, but then it just goes up. Now it does not matter what I do I honestly cannot lose a pound, if anything I will gain two.

I've skipped meals, worked out for 2 hours a day, tracked calories, had 1200 calories, cut bread, rice, pasta; I've tried keto, I've tried everything.

I recently had a breast reduction surgery, so didn't work out for 2-3 months, WITHOUT GAINING WEIGHT, I lost 2 pounds after surgery, and being motivated, I decided to keep the momentum going. Due to the surgery, my doctor recommended Pilates before going back to the gym, and I've been VERY consistent and very mindful of what I'm eating but guess what: gained 5 pounds in 1 month.

Every time I address this I want to cry because I'm done caring for this, I'm done being a good dieter and then zero results, if negative ones.

I would love to hear any word of encouragement, any tips, whatever makes you feel better or whatever helped you lose weight.

It's been a terrifying two weeks as I seriously thought I was in for a long recovery. What has cured me  95% in 3 days is taking [Nuleaf THC gummies](https://nuleafnaturals.com/product/delta-9-thc-gummies/). I had read from previous posts that it makes others symptoms worse, but for my case, they were gone almost overnight and I have been just recovering making sure my prostate doesn't clench up again. So I imagine I have a few more days to get to 100%

How I know the THC was working: 

I felt a cooling area around my groin as my muscles released.

I could urinate immediately and at full volume

And I had trouble doing Kegals as my muscles just wanted to relax

Best of all, the first day it made me more aware of **when** I had tense pelvic muscles, so I could stretch them or relax consciously. I recognized my sitting posture and corrected it.

To do this regime, I took the equivalent of 3 to 4 gummies per day.  The **cooling effect** was the indicator of when I had taken a high enough dosage, and when it went away I knew to take more. For myself who rarely takes gummies, I was at the lowest end of being ""high"". It allowed me to take more daytime naps that I'm sure greatly healed me. 

  
To reiterate the info I have seen on here I want to share what helped me most other than THC.

1)[Stretching my pelvic muscles](https://youtu.be/oyGEVPuumtk?si=EpTA0dKmLE0L1vyq) and breathing helped

2) Avoiding caffeine and alcohol as this seriously agitated my prostatitis 

3) Daily hikes to get at a high BPM (HITT workout) 

4) Going commando helped me stop thinking about the pressure/pain

5) Heating pad wrapped around my groin for 15 minutes was like a mini sauna that relaxed all my muscles

How I got into this was a combination of a depressive episode, overexerting squats at the gym, coffee, and taking antibiotics for longer than I needed. I'm so thankful to be out of the extreme anxiety, and this whole process has left me more empathetic towards others, and appreciative of alternative medicine and meditation. I wish the best for everyone else's recovery.

I just started doing a keto/fasting routine guided by my doctor and have been averaging about 1lb weight loss a day over the last week or so since I started.

My doctor wanted me to start doing a keto/fasting routine since over the last 9 years I have been doing a low-carb diet mainly and lost over 250 lbs at one point but over the last year, I did gain 40lbs back because I had 2 cancer scares and now have arthritis in my lower back and deteriorating tissue around my lower spine which I found out my uncle has it and my grandmother had the same issue when she was still alive. I was hurting so bad I had to start PT and avoid workouts because it made things worse. I was told it probably started to flare up after my years in wrestling. So sometimes due to the back pain I get from time to time my workouts aren't everyday like they used to be.

I am still down 225lbs but I want to lose at least another 80-85 lbs

SW: was 465  
CW: is 241  
GW: is 155-160 (my doctor told me this because I do carry more muscle mass than most girls my age)

My questions are...

**what kinda things do you have during your fasting times?**

so far I have been sticking with sparkling water and black coffee, but is there anything else? I am a caffeine addict I will admit it but I find after my 4th cup of coffee I start to get jittery lol

**What kinda foods do you enjoy eating?**

I have always been a meat/potato kinda person, trying to get used to doing meat and more veggies and no potatoes.

**Do you ever have it where you aren't hungry when you're fasting ends?**

The reason I ask this is that I tried fasting years ago and I used to get shaky 2-3 hours before I would finish a 16/8 fast... now I know what to expect I don't get like that but sometimes I find myself still feeling full, so I started to do a 20/4 fast and I feel better and hungry after that fast time ends but then I only eat between 1000-1200 calories during that 4-hour window, yet still feel good.

**What kinda sauces/marinades do you like using? Do you make homemade sauces?**

Reason I ask this is because I just took a pork slab of ribs outta my freezer and trying to figure out how to cook/season/sauce it

**Everyone has a sweet tooth, what are the sweet desserts you like making on keto?**

# TIA!

(Southwest Michigan, USA)

Woke approximately 4:55am on Wednesday, October 2, 2024. Went out on the back porch with coffee, approximately 5:25am and noticed a line in the sky, stretching from east to west, and partially glowing (presumably because its origination point at the time was almost precisely where the Sun would rise, in about two hours, and it was extending around the Earth's curvature, catching sunlight before sunrise). It seemed very high up in the atmosphere, even making it look like a ""wrinkle"" of the Milky Way (I'm no astronomer). 

After being able to get a couple of photos (no filters or editing - but shutter on camera did remain open longer to compensate for the darkness), I noticed that the line was drifting to the south very, very slowly (from my perception). By basing its location on Orion, it did gradually get further and further away. The more it drifted south, the less it seemed to glow, and it extended as far east and west as I could see, in both directions. It did not seem to have a ""thinner"" end, to indicate the direction of trajectory, and the line did not seem to dissipate much, in a visible or noticeable way.

By approximately 6:00am, it had completely disappeared to the south, plus it was getting cold outside, after nearly an unplanned half-hour in inadequate clothing, having only planned on a few minutes outside.

The additional line you may notice, that partially shines in some of the photos, is my clothesline, which is a metal cable with a green rubberized-coating.

My neighbor, who is a University science professor, and former amateur astronomer, said he was ""speechless"", after reviewing the photos for a while. Does anyone have any probable theories of what may have caused this? Did anyone else see it on that morning, or have a similar sighting on a previous night?

Thank you in advance for your thoughts.",1,1728173352.0,aerospace,0,1.0,False

1fx3zft,https://www.reddit.com/r/geegees/comments/1fx3zft/shut_the_fuck_up_when_you_go_study_at_morisset/,SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN YOU GO STUDY AT MORISSET!!! ESPECIALLY DURING MIDTERMS!!!,"I know this is a regular complaint on this sub, but I don‚Äôt care. 

I have 2 exams and 3 projects due next week. I go to Morisset SPECIFICALLY because it‚Äôs supposed to be a quiet place to study. This is a well-known fact. It‚Äôs plastered everywhere on the walls, especially on the upper floors. At our grown age, it should be a given that library = quiet, right?

And yet, some patrons apparently can‚Äôt read, because I keep seeing (and hearing) people take FaceTime calls, have full conversations with their buddies, or even listen to music without headphones *at* their study cubes. All this, mind you, while a big fat ‚ÄúQUIET PLEASE‚Äù sign is hanging above their heads. 

I can‚Äôt believe this needs to be said, but talking out loud and having conversations in a designated focus space is a bona fide dick move, especially during midterms. People are studying. You‚Äôre not allowing them a quiet & productive environment when you decide to call your friend and have a 30 minute conversation about your evening plans. Nobody wants to hear you talk. It‚Äôs self centred and rude. 

As a courtesy, here are a list of places in or around Morisset where you CAN take phone calls or have conversations WITHOUT disrupting the peace:
* Soundproof phone booths (there should be a few scattered around in the building)
* The first floor of the library
* Study rooms (you can book them on your phone or computer, fun fact /s)
* FSS
* CRX
* The dining hall
* Montpetit
* Hamelin
* Simard
* Minto
* SITE
* STEM

And, for those who don‚Äôt like these options, here are some other ones!
* Going to a coffee shop; we have Happy Goat, Second Cup, Starbucks, and Figaro nearby, to name a few
* Going to an Ottawa Public Library (OPL)
* (My personal favourite) staying the fuck home!!!

I also want to address any excuses that some of you may use to defend your behaviour:
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking, I‚Äôm whispering!‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter. If i can hear you from a row away, you‚Äôre too loud. Shut up.
* ‚ÄúBut I need to call XYZ!‚Äù Go outside, or on the first floor, or in a phone booth. Text the person instead. In any case, shut up.
* ‚ÄúWell, I‚ÄôM not studying for a midterm!!‚ÄùShould we give you a gold star? Should we call Jacques Fr√©mont? 
* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just this one time-‚Äú Don‚Äôt care. Shut up.
* ‚ÄúBut what if I want to ask a question to my friend-‚Äú Text them. Go outside of the  quiet floor for 5 minutes. Whisper in their ear instead of speaking loudly enough that I can hear what you‚Äôre saying. In any case, shut up!

In conclusion, the library is a QUIET space. If you take 2 minutes to read the sign and understand what ‚Äúquiet‚Äù means, you can avoid being annoying to everyone around you. I used to keep my mouth shut whenever people were too loud, but I don‚Äôt give a shit anymore. From now on, if youre being a noisy prick at the library, I‚Äôm telling you to quiet down.

For good measure, I‚Äôll say it again:

SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She said nobody is going to want to be around you.  She told me I am lucky my husband doesn‚Äôt leave me.  I told her that that hurt me and if she was married it would hurt her feelings if someone said that to her.  

‚ÄúOh I didn‚Äôt mean it like that‚Äù she said.  Well what way did she mean it!  I had asked her to keep my diagnoses confidential and she told her two sisters and another Freind she has who all know me about it and I am sure they told their spouses who also know me.

She is a gossip and I am humiliated.  There‚Äôs no one I can trust with my diagnosis. Everyone treats me different and my other friends who I went to college with and it was always the 4 of us started getting together without me.  My one friend who I was closer with and occasionally would go to coffee with or go for walks with kept posting on Facebook the times the 3 of them would get together without me.  She did this repeatedly and knew it hurt my feelings but she didn‚Äôt care.  

She once told me she felt left out when Kay (one of the 3 girls I got together with) & another woman that lived by them got together without her.  So why can‚Äôt she understand why I felt hurt when she kept posting photos of the 3 of them without me on Facebook. 

She told me that she thinks I feel sorry for myself.  One time we all got together they put a gum drop in my pill holder in my luggage bag.  I feel that was immature and an invasion of my privacy.

I finally blew up at her.  She was a toxic friend and didn‚Äôt care about me.  I am now afraid to trust anyone because all my friends crapped on me.  

I try asking people to do things but no one wants to.  I only have my husband for support.  My sister is a narcissistic psychopath and my brother is an addict.
I feel like no one cares about me.  Thank God for my husband!

I expect the unexpected.‚Äù¬† Some things don‚Äôt change; the cameras are still effective ‚Äì not so much as a communication avenue or alarm to catch her attention now as for reassuring security purposes.¬† Nehemia, her son, and Cheyenne, her daughter, both say Rob fits right in and is the missing piece of the puzzle at just the right time.¬† This King of the World is going to have a welcome home party, but he won‚Äôt be expecting too many guests from his side; they only visited him once in 6 years in the slammer.¬† His sister has children‚Äôs obligations and allergies, and his friend, Tony, ‚Äúis still fucked up.‚Äù¬† His mom Kate, who has a tempestuous relationship with her rival daughter-in-law does show up belatedly.¬† Tennie‚Äôs mother, Charlene was looking forward to meeting both in-laws.¬† Kate, a more sedated version of Troy‚Äôs mom, Karen, is also a bitch with a bone to carry and pick.¬† ‚Äú‚Äù¬†I‚Äôm here,‚Äù she tells her son, ‚Äúbut you is a problem.¬† I don‚Äôt like the way you‚Äôve been treating me.¬† I mean I feel so distant.¬† Like what did I do‚Äù?¬† Rob answers, ‚ÄúLike nobody know what I‚Äôm goin‚Äô through mentally.¬† I was locked up almost 17 years.¬† I always loved you but I‚Äôm older now and I have kids down here.‚Äù¬† Mom rejoins without blinking an eye while giving the eye to Tennie, ‚ÄúI get it, but at the end of the day when she won‚Äôt be there, I‚Äôm gonna‚Äô be there.‚Äù¬† What does that mean?¬† ‚ÄúI just made a comment.¬† I can‚Äôt make no comment‚Äù?¬† ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù asks Tennie, ‚Äúmakes you think I won‚Äôt be there?¬† What is your problem with me‚Äù?¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know; it‚Äôs hypothetical.‚Äù¬† There was nothing hypothetical, however, when that interchange erupted like Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 which destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum which were never built again. ¬†*If karma doesn‚Äôt hit you, I gladly will.*

1fx3vwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1fx3vwm/seeking_advice_a_friendly_spirit_has_been_around/,seeking advice- a friendly spirit has been around and seems to have a message,"about a year ago i was living in an over 100 year old house where there was a known history of multiple people having died in it. multiple people who have lived there have said they‚Äôve seen ghosts or had experiences they couldn‚Äôt explain. i was very comfortable in that house, but the energy was definitely there, and you never felt totally alone. 

one night i was cooking dinner and a ceramic plate moved about 4 or 5 inches on the counter. i both watched and heard it scrape along the surface. then about a week later, i was in my room (next to the kitchen) and it was around 3am and i heard a loud crash. i came out of my room because i thought one of my roommates fell down the stairs, but no one else was awake, and all of our pots and pans had seemingly flown out of the cabinet and across the room. 

maybe a month later, friend of mine was staying with us and we were chatting and randomly my friend said ‚Äúis this place haunted?‚Äù and i said ‚Äúoh for sure haha‚Äù and they said they could feel it. then maybe 30 seconds later we heard a knocking sound, and no one else was home, so we just said hello and acknowledged the spirit and asked if they wanted to have breakfast with us, and we put out a plate and mug of coffee. 

about a month after that, i was sitting working at my kitchen table and i was about to read some tarot for myself. again, empty house. as im shuffling my cards, i heard a knocking coming from the other side of my bedroom door. i open my door to see if anything fell into the door, and i checked if there was anyone on the porch. nothing. so i asked my tarot cards ‚Äúis there someone here, and are we chill?‚Äù lol 

the reading essentially said yes and it‚Äôs either a loved one from my past or from a past life. i believe that, i had a lot of friends who died really young and tragically. my grandfather also died of cancer a month before i was born, and before he died said he wasn‚Äôt afraid of death but was devastated he would never get to meet me. it could very well be any of those people just coming in to check up and hang out. i felt very comforted after that reading, and i started to often put out an extra cup of coffee for the spirit, since they seem to enjoy being in the kitchen and generally in the morning. 

i recently moved in with my partner into their apartment. i‚Äôve been in this apartment many times and my partner and their former roommate had lived in it for 3 years before i moved in. no one had ever felt any kind of presence before. i figured my old house was just a spot where the veil was thin, especially because there had been multiple deaths there. however, the other day in my current place, i was showering while my partner was at the office. i heard the front door unlock, open and close, and i heard shuffling around the apartment. i figured my partner had just gotten home from work early. when i got out of the shower, i said ‚Äúhey! how was work?‚Äù but i got no response and i looked around and my partner wasn‚Äôt there. i checked their location on my phone to see if maybe they‚Äôd stopped by and left, but they were still at work. nothing was moved or taken, and i also never heard the 
door open and close and lock again, and the door was still shut and locked when i checked it. 

that night my partner and i did a tarot reading to ask what we should know about this encounter, and again the reading was positive and essentially said that they are a loved one who is trying to guide me to something. 

i‚Äôd love if any mediums here could provide any tips on how to better understand what my loved one is trying to guide me towards, or what to pay attention to. i would also love to figure out who it is, if possible. i care less about that tho, because i am just happy that they‚Äôre there and they care for me. im mostly just curious lol. also, how can i best make my space comfortable for this loved one to share with my partner and i?

sorry for the literal novel. i just wanted to provide thorough context! 



tldr: spirit of a loved one has made their presence known, seems to be trying to guide me towards something. 
i‚Äôd like to try to figure out what they‚Äôre trying to guide me to and also what are the best practices to make my space welcoming and comfortable to this loved one.

Here is a short story I got from a 3 sentence prompt:  


>Mittens perched on the edge of the windowsill, her tiny paws barely gripping the cold wood. The world outside her cozy little home was a swirl of chaos. From her vantage point, she could see the smoke rising in dark plumes, blotting out the sun and painting the sky a grim shade of ash. The distant sound of sirens wailed, a haunting melody that reverberated in her small chest. 

>She twitched her ears, captivated by the scene. Strange vehicles‚Äîmetallic beasts‚Äîmoved with an urgency she couldn‚Äôt understand. They sped past, leaving behind trails of dust and debris. Shadows danced across the streets, casting eerie figures that flickered and faded in the dim light. 

>Mittens had always thought of herself as a little explorer, a pioneer of her sunlit kingdom‚Äîa kingdom she believed to be her own. Each day, she would chase the dust motes in her living room, pounce on unsuspecting shadows, and curl up on the warm lap of her human, blissfully unaware of the world beyond her reach.

>But today was different. The air was thick with tension, almost as if the universe was holding its breath. With wide, amber eyes, she observed the swirling clouds of smoke. Something gnawed at her, a feeling she‚Äôd never quite experienced before. A fleeting memory flickered in her mind‚Äîher own playful batting at the red button on the coffee table, a button her human had told her never to touch. It had glowed ominously, flashing in rhythm with her taps. 

>Suddenly, the pieces clicked together. Mittens‚Äô heart raced as she recalled the stories she‚Äôd overheard from her human and the hushed voices of visitors. World leaders bickering, decisions made in dark rooms, and that fateful night when she‚Äôd pounced on the button, the bright light piercing through the quiet house like a dagger.

>‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù she mewed to herself, her whiskers twitching in horror. ‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù She stared out at the devastation below, a world crumbling before her innocent gaze. Buildings that once stood tall now lay in ruins, and the flickering lights that dotted the city seemed to dim one by one. The weight of her actions hung heavily in the air.

>Tears welled in her eyes as she imagined the humans who once walked those streets, their lives turned upside down because of a little kitten‚Äôs curiosity. Remorse flooded her tiny body; she could almost feel the weight of the world pressing down on her furry shoulders.

>But then, as she gazed out at the apocalyptic landscape, a mischievous glint returned to her eyes. What if‚Äîjust what if‚Äîthis chaos was an invitation? A world of new adventures awaited beyond the window. She was no longer just a kitten; she was a conqueror, a catalyst of change! 

>With a sudden bounce of energy, Mittens turned, ready to explore the wild frontier beyond her home. ‚ÄúWorld War III?‚Äù she chirped gleefully. ‚ÄúMore like World Exploration I!‚Äù And with a flick of her tail, she bounded off, ready to embrace the pandemonium.",1,1728172733.0,ChatGPT,2,1.0,False

I have a fear that they'll be offended by my presence and I'll be judged not only by her but the surrounding public, so I wouldn't be able to go back to that location if I did that. I looked at the advice on this subreddit and the advice is to friendly talk to them like any other man (i.e casual conversation, don't compliment her body), and do it only at bars or coffee shops. How do you do that when you're the opposite sex though? Women are people, but they're still different from men, the main thing in this context is their defensiveness, and I don't want to violate it. The other advice is don't go in looking for date(???), do they mean don't immediately ask for a date, but instead talk for a couple of minutes and then ask to give your phone number to her? Or just hope for the best? Also check with eye contact before approaching, if she smiles or gives eye contact back that's a sign to approach . How long is too long eye contact and it just becomes creepy staring? 

I just don't want to be creepy, that's my biggest fear. I feel like every woman would be creeped out if I asked them how their day was. How can I get over this feeling? ",1,1728172667.0,dating_advice,4,0.99,False

I'm trying to empathize, but when I imagine dating a woman who I knew could get on top of me and hold me down no matter what I did, that's one of the hottest things I can imagine (I thought I was a dom, but maybe it's more switch...)

Anyway, I'm split because on one hand, I'm surprised so many women were surprised by this in adulthood.  Of course I'd be fine with them not knowing, except I fear this could lead them to do things they otherwise wouldn't have, like that one Reddit story about the guy who's girlfriend would walk alone at night through a rough side of town because she worked out at the gym 30 minutes a day and beat him in play fights (which she thought were real), so she thought she could take anyone. 

But on the other, I see women talking about how it makes them afraid to anger their boyfriends.  Of course, I'm thinking if that's even a factor, there are more problems there.  There are many things that I, or anyone, *could* do that we trust them not to, especially in a relationship.   I mean, she could pull a gun or a knife.  Poison my coffee. Run my over.  Whatever.  I'm thinking if knowing he's stronger than her makes her think he might harm her just because she annoyed him, either she's paranoid or he's doing things to make her feel unsafe.

This stick is not at all hefty in hand. He‚Äôs buttery soft. The initial scent not overly aromatic. Pigtail cap is ever so slightly sweetened. Foot is solid and I get notes of‚Ä¶peanut butter?  V-cut on the cap, cold draw proves to be easy and that‚Äôs where I pick up on the citrus. Toasting the foot is a beautiful thing. Even burn with a crazy good smoky cloud. 

1/3 I think I‚Äôm in love. The creaminess of this cigar is impeccable. Pepper notes hit the tip of my tongue with some tingling noticed. The sweetness I get is very vanilla buttercream if that makes sense. It coats the tongue. Burn line is even with a beautiful banded ash. 

2/3 still hitting it with that incredible creaminess. I‚Äôm now picking up on some citrus more like a lemon grass than actual citrus though. That pepper picks up some and is now hitting solidly at the back of my tongue and lingering there. Construction is getting a little wonky with some cracking of the wrapper at the end of the 2/3

3/3 creaminess still going strong. Now I‚Äôm picking up on some coffee in there along with some nuttiness that I‚Äôd like to think is peanut butter but could just be toasted nuts. The wrapper really starts to come undone for me toward the end and I give up trying to fix him. I know I should tough it out but I give him a graceful end and let him burn himself out. 

Overall this stick for me is a 9.5/10. The only issues I had were wrapper construction towards the end and resting smell was average. I will be purchasing another and letting it rest longer in hopes next time that won‚Äôt be the issue. The flavor profile for me was spot on. I love the creaminess.

I come from America, and my go-to anywhere that had an espresso machine was super easy -- large cup of ice, double shot of espresso, and fill most of the rest with almond/soy milk (if they have it). Essentially just like an Americano with extra ice, milk, and less water. I like it to start off really strong to get me going, and get weaker as the ice melts. Kind of like a Vietnamese coffee without all the sugar.

But I'm realizing that custom espresso orders don't really seem to be a thing here? 

* For example, I rarely see straight-up espresso on the menu. Even the Starbucks app doesn't have it. 
* I ordered *iced* espresso the other day when there was only *hot* on the menu, and they got it to me, but my Japanese friend said its not on the menu so I shouldn't have ordered it. 
* And I know I can definitely add soy milk to Americanos at Starbucks if I order in person. But should I feel bad if I just go up and ask for a large iced Americano with extra ice and soy milk? Typing that out it feels crazy that I'm even asking this, but here I am.

**TL;DR** - I know Japan isn't a very customization-friendly culture for food. What's the culture around coffee drink customizations? Am I inconveniencing the workers if I ask for exactly how I like my espresso, even if its not on the menu? Bonus if I can get recommendations for cafes with good espresso.",1,1728172506.0,Tokyo,7,0.6,False

You can read my past posts to catch up, but in nutshell, I've been informed by both my christian therapist and pastor that my mexican husband is emotionally abusive, extremely manipulative, and the best choice is to divorce. 

My husband sees it as him trying to help me be the best I can be, giving me everything I need to be successful. I have examples on previous posts that contradict that. When I told him about it being emotional abuse, he said it's the classic American feminist mentality that my therapist is instilling in me, and there are two sides to the tortilla. He said he's always been here for me and wants nothing but the best for me.

Anyway, today there was another 2 hour lecture (he expressed his feelings for literally 2 hours). Usually it makes me sad. He mentioned divorce ( not him divorcing me but me divorcing him). He didn't get a reaction out of me at all like he usually does (sad and mad).

So after the conversation he acted very differently. He acted nice.

When was that last time he invited me out to do something, besides a coffee? (Maybe April?)
Now suddenly that my parents are coming up for a week, he cares about what I'm doing?

 Today he wanted to get coffee with me. The last time he asked me to get a coffee was at least 2 months ago, probably more. 

Tomorrow, he knows I have plans with my parents...for at least church and lunch. Now, he asks, ""what are you doing tomorrow in the afternoon? I'm in the mood to play pool. Just you and me.""

Hmmmmm, why now suddenly that my parents are coming up? Plus he already said he's going to go to church and possibly lunch with his friends (his own church with his single, younger, friends who are male and female). Now suddenly he wants to change my brakes (one has been shot for 3 weeks) and cut the grass. He'll say its because he didnt have time and money before, but are we sure? Are you sure it isnt because of my parents? Does he not want them to see how it really is?

Why is he now talking to me more today after the original 2 hour conversation...and subtly complimenting me or saying what i want to hear (our son is really interested in basketball. Maybe we can go to the ymca and you can teach him. I told him im not very good at it, but that you are.""

""This chili is really really good. Make sure you dont give it away when everyone's done. If there's any leftover, i want it.""

He would say its all a coincidence. But i wonder if there is some subconscious manipulation

This stick is not at all hefty in hand. He‚Äôs buttery soft. The initial scent not overly aromatic. Pigtail cap is ever so slightly sweetened. Foot is solid and I get notes of‚Ä¶peanut butter?  V-cut on the cap, cold draw proves to be easy and that‚Äôs where I pick up on the citrus. Toasting the foot is a beautiful thing. Even burn with a crazy good smoky cloud. 

1/3 I think I‚Äôm in love. The creaminess of this cigar is impeccable. Pepper notes hit the tip of my tongue with some tingling noticed. The sweetness I get is very vanilla buttercream if that makes sense. It coats the tongue. Burn line is even with a beautiful banded ash. 

2/3 still hitting it with that incredible creaminess. I‚Äôm now picking up on some citrus more like a lemon grass than actual citrus though. That pepper picks up some and is now hitting solidly at the back of my tongue and lingering there. Construction is getting a little wonky with some cracking of the wrapper at the end of the 2/3

3/3 creaminess still going strong. Now I‚Äôm picking up on some coffee in there along with some nuttiness that I‚Äôd like to think is peanut butter but could just be toasted nuts. The wrapper really starts to come undone for me toward the end and I give up trying to fix him. I know I should tough it out but I give him a graceful end and let him burn himself out. 

Overall this stick for me is a 9.5/10. The only issues I had were wrapper construction towards the end and resting smell was average. I will be purchasing another and letting it rest longer in hopes next time that won‚Äôt be the issue. The flavor profile for me was spot on. I love the creaminess.

Back then, the market wasn‚Äôt flooded with 39/49 coffee shops like it is now. Business was promising until last year, when everything shifted. Suddenly, our area became saturated with new cafes, and we struggled to keep up. The competition hit hard, and the financial pressure mounted. We had to take out another loan just to stay afloat, all while still paying off the original loan from when we first opened. 

Now, we find ourselves under 500k in debt, and despite our best efforts, the market is still tough. My partner, who had been managing the day-to-day operations of the shop, recently accepted a job abroad, partly to help cover our monthly loan payments. That leaves me with a choice. I could take over managing the coffee shop myself, but with a full-time job already, I‚Äôm not sure if it's worth the struggle. Should I just let go of the business?

But been a little over a week now without taking 2mg estradiol twice a day and 50mg spironolactone twice day( not by choice) and honestly I thought the feelings I felt was intense while I was on them but after not being in them I have not felt hungry in a week, I've been eating girlies lol I eat about twice to three times a day to try and keep up with a healthier food intake, but also ive noticed that my depression has increased and that I've been craving attention lately a lot more then normal? Could be due to other mental issues, but I also feel emotionally off like all I feel is this emptyness inside and that I just get this very bad craving to just go all out I don't really know how to explain it, I've been very shy most of my life about this, and I'm in a transphobic town and I have to create a life here before I can leave job,car, so on so forth, Im turning 26 next month, I'm just confused and not sure where to out this or what grouo this honestly needs to be in, but i tried before in the bpd area and never had response,. But I'm not sure what I'm expecting out of this but I just don't feel right most of the time then I have this deep empty feeling and then there's this urge that kicks in and pretty much just get dressed get all doded up and party and have no cares in the world, I just want to enjoy life the way it was meant to be and some reason I have these contradicting thoughts of no don't it's dangerous you'll be hurt, don't you won't look right, you can pull of being a gay guy but that's not what you want, but all I want is to be this lady i imagine in my head, I feel like ive lost something important and that the fealing i have left is dread?

I want to have fun I want to have the laughs the girls night out but that just seems so far away and then theres other things but those are secret shhh lol welp I'm signing off now talk to you all later lovely ladies I hope you all have your dreams met.


Edit: I also realized even for being so young I have personally set up my life to fall and crash and burn, I have personally felt like I've been watching my life fall apart and every time I've felt like I'm doing good or I'm doing better for myself life seems to always get in the way, I have trying to figure this stuff out since I was 12 and I have yet to fix my life I don't know who or what I've become or done but I feel like I've seen it all and done it all but also feel like I haven't done anything at all and feel as if I need to do everything and anything and just through all cares to the wind and become what I believe what I and who I am to be. I know I'm a mess and a lost cause and a wreck but one day I'll be the girl down the hall dancing and singing to some of the craziest songs with the biggest smile on my face and I'll wave and say I hope you have a amazing day you beautiful lady, (or guy to who ever is reading this later in the future) and while skipping down the hall to live and enjoy everything, a cup of coffee ‚òï ‚ù§Ô∏è a nice book or two and nice spot at the Cafe and a nice view the overlooks the town square ‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm just the Wishful girl in down the hall you'll see skipping and happy. 


I hope you have a great day.
I'm not sad or upset or in danger. I'm just lost and one day I'll find myself again. Until then Ill just try to put on a smile sing out loud to my music and skip on by people and try to brighten their days because sometimes it's nice to see someone just having no cares in the world and just enjoying their life's.

1fx3ki6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fx3ki6/journey_with_anxiety/,Journey with anxiety ,"Over the past few years, I‚Äôve experienced multiple episodes of anxiety. Often, I would notice something unusual with my skin or body and immediately panic, thinking the worst. This led to frequent visits to the emergency room or booking appointments with my doctor. Eventually, I went so often that my doctor began to look disappointed in me and recommended that I seek help from mental health professionals. I did try to find a therapist, but at the time, I wasn‚Äôt able to get one quickly.

Around this time, I also started drinking more caffeine. Since I was consistent with my gym routine, I‚Äôd often have iced coffee before my workouts. Later in the day, I‚Äôd have energy drinks like C4 or Bang. I wasn‚Äôt drinking them every single day, but often enough that it became part of my routine. Then one day, everything changed. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for an energy drink, so I grabbed an iced coffee from Starbucks, but I added an extra shot of espresso. While at the gym, I started feeling palpitations in my chest. I was convinced I was having a heart attack because of the chest discomfort. I ended up in the ER that night, but after running tests, they told me everything was fine and that it was likely just my heart skipping a beat.

After that experience, I began cutting back on caffeine, drinking it only once a week. Then, on December 31, 2020, during the pandemic lockdowns, I was feeling particularly stressed. I decided to take a C4 energy drink and, for the first time, I ate an entire edible by myself‚Äîabout 100 mg. That night, I had the worst panic attack of my life. My reality felt distorted, my chest felt locked, and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I had to call 911 because I didn‚Äôt know what was happening. After running tests, everything came back normal. The doctors said it was just anxiety. From that moment on, I swore off caffeine.

Looking back, I realize that my decision to completely avoid caffeine might be extreme. I know that caffeine, in moderation, isn‚Äôt harmful, but the way I was consuming it was not good for my body. Even my 88-year-old grandmother drinks coffee regularly. Yet, I‚Äôve convinced myself that I‚Äôm more sensitive to it than she is. Now, I avoid caffeine in all forms‚Äîtea, soda, anything. It‚Äôs a bit extreme, and sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm just being overly cautious.

Between 2021 and 2024, I‚Äôve had multiple episodes of anxiety. Most of the time, I can calm myself down by drinking water or practicing breathing techniques. However, recently, I‚Äôve been spiraling more. I haven‚Äôt been getting much sleep because I‚Äôve been working two jobs for the past year. This lack of rest has made my anxiety worse. A few months ago, I had a panic attack while I was sleep-deprived. I felt dizzy and on the verge of passing out, but in my mind, I was convinced I was dying. My first instinct was to panic. My parents tried to calm me down, but I ended up calling 911 again. After they checked my vitals and reassured me that everything was fine, I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. I tossed and turned for hours before telling my dad that I needed to go to the hospital. After more tests, everything came back fine, but it felt like I was trapped in a never-ending cycle.

I did therapy for about a year, and it helped having a therapist to talk to. However, when it came time to renew, my insurance denied my request, so I focused more on work instead. Unfortunately, this caused me to spiral further. I‚Äôm currently looking for a new therapist and psychologist to help manage my anxiety. While I don‚Äôt believe in taking medication, I‚Äôm starting to feel worn out by this endless loop.

Exercise has always helped with my anxiety, but with my work and school schedule, I barely have time. I‚Äôm considering getting a gym membership at a place with more extensive hours so I can fit it into my routine. A few months ago, I used to go on walks with my dog, but lately, I‚Äôve been panicking when I see my heart rate increase. It‚Äôs irrational‚ÄîI know my heart rate going up is normal‚Äîbut it scares me. I also have ADHD, and I wonder if that‚Äôs contributing to the worsening of my anxiety.

At this point, I‚Äôm grateful for anyone who can offer advice or suggestions, as this journey has been exhausting.

So any supplements that can help push away the daytime sleepiness/exhaustion are worth trying.

Cordyceps(and other mushrooms)- great energy and focus. Increased libido the first few weeks. Nausea that tapered after a week. I generally take a minimum of 3,000mg cordyceps daily.

Phosphatidylserine/coffee extract- No noticeable effects, but I still take it daily until I run out(not wasting the bottle)

Huperzine A- good energy, but a little bit too much restless energy. Great for vivid dreams, but after a week I become more irritable. Discontinued.

Neurolink- something from Amazon. No effect, good or bad. Discontinued.

Black Seed Oil- need to be careful, as I had an extremely unpleasant drop in blood pressure taking it the first time. But it does seem to help increase focus and energy. Intermittently take this, at a very low dose.

Furthermore, he doesn't act like how I would expect a priest to act, at least not around me. For example, he makes sexual jokes, including homosexual jokes. I'm not really bothered by these things, but it's strange. He seems like a good guy, and he technically wasn't lying about being a writer, because I'm sure he writes sermons etc. But omitting such a big part of his life seems weird.

Mediation isn't happening until middle of November. We've been separated for over a year. The attorney needs additional funds. You know, the usual. I made a post a few days ago about my wife wanting to reconcile, and if I'm honest, I really tried to play out what it would look like. How would I forgive these things? How would I move on? I sat down with her and laid things out on the table. Firstly, no matter what happens, we still divorce and finalize things. I have to protect myself. Period. Secondly, if there were EVER a reconsideration, we'd be starting from scratch and I felt I'd need to see her in therapy, sober, and respectfully find a group of less shitty friends. I know the friend group rubs her the wrong way, but you guys know the ones that I'm talking about. The ones that talk shit about everyone and each other behind each others back, that spend their time at the local pubs and don't really give a shit about anything about whose getting their next drink. The ones that, as my wife got closer with, helped to push me farther away. Except now one thinks she should fix things because she's trying to fix things with her husband, and I'm ""cute and make a lot of money""

  
Anyhow, that wasn't received well and now we're not on talking terms. It is what it is. She goes back to claiming I'm too controlling. If thats the case, why fix things? Was i jealous of certain people? For sure. Did I want to push her to become a better version of herself? Absolutely. Was I controlling? I don't think so. I think I did everything I could to provide, sure I had my issues. 

  
She claims I just want her to stay under my nose and stuck at the house all time. That was never the case, when our son arrived I encouraged her to spend her maternity time at home and if she opted, to take care of him or start schooling. This is because she took maybe \~2 weeks off when my daughter was born (I adopted her) before she went back to work. I wanted her to be able to experience motherhood. I wanted to pay for her school to find out what interested her. Hell, I didn't care if it was basket weaving. I just felt like there was more potential there.

  
Anyhow, as I'm sitting here watching my kids play outside before it gets too dark I've come to realize I've never quite been able to tell her no. She's the only woman I could never tell no. All the others, I never had a problem telling. With her, I'm not sure what it is.

Halastar brought *The Fury* in hard.¬†

‚ÄúFrigate wing, your job is to reinforce *The Gauntlet*. Leave *Heavenfall*, and *Spiteful* to us.

There was a chorus of affirmative responses over the fleet-com, and the seven Terran frigates split their vector off, making best speed towards the ailing *Gauntlet*.¬†

Halastar turned to his helmsman. ‚ÄúHelmsman, take us straight in. Gunnery load up all tubes and batteries.‚Äù

*This would have to be quick*, the shipmaster realized, *The other vessels don‚Äôt have long*.

Halastar weighed his options. They wanted to capture as many vessels as possible, but they could not wait for a boarding party to seize control without potentially losing ships of their own. With that in mind, four enemy vessels against two damaged cruisers and the *Fury* was hardly a guaranteed win. They had to turn the odds somehow.

‚ÄúSensors, give me a full scan sweep and profile of the enemy vessels.‚Äù

The young ensign, pale faced, but resolved, replied ‚ÄúEnemy vessel‚Äôs shields are up, but they‚Äôve taken some damage. I‚Äôm reading fluctuations in drive signatures that suggests they‚Äôre pushing their reactors hard. There is also indication of significant hull stress along the aft of vessel one and two.‚Äù

Halastar thought carefully, surveying the data as it scrolled across his display.¬†

*It would be a gamble*.

‚ÄúHelmsman, belay that last order.‚Äù He called out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sending you a new vector.‚Äù

He quickly did the math, and typed out a course, sending it to the helmsman‚Äôs station.

The officer turned at looked at him, ‚ÄúConfirming intercept course, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúConfirmed.‚Äù Halastar replied, turning to face the other bridge officers, ‚ÄúNew orders, listen up! Engineering, take the safety limiters off the reactor, I need twenty points of extra yield. Shields, raise prow shield to maximum yield, draw down all other emitters to minimum. Master at arms, signal the prow compartments to evacuate.‚Äù

Now all the bridge stations were looking at him with uncertainty writ large on their expressions.

He looked each and every one of them in the eyes.¬†

‚ÄúSound the brace alarm, we‚Äôre going to ram these bastards.‚Äù

-----------------------------------------------

On the bridge of *Heavenfall* the situation was grim.¬†

Shipmaster Hiad listened to the chorus of calls ring out around him.

‚ÄúShields are falling at aft, port shields at ten percent!‚Äù An officer called.

Hiad turned to his Helmsman, ‚ÄúRoll us to present port shields.‚Äù

*It was hopeless*, he realized, his desperation overflowing, *We‚Äôre done*.

Their sensors, weapons and shields were all failing, and their gun batteries were next to empty. Soon enough their luck would run out and their shields would fail catastrophically, and a torpedo or projectile would end the fight with a flash of blinding light and pain.

The *Spiteful* was doing no better, he knew. They had stopped responding to hails ten minutes prior. Either their communications systems had been damaged, or‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBring up optical sensors on the main display, please.‚Äù

Hiad stood up from his bridge station, straightening his uniform as he did so. Despite the rising panic he felt in himself, he resolved to not show it in front of his officers. He was immensely proud of all of them, and he wouldn‚Äôt disgrace their efforts by breaking down.

On the main displays he saw the cruiser *Spiteful* taking a withering amount of fire. The vessel‚Äôs flickering shields stopped most of the shots, but as the energy envelope began to fail projectiles and kinetic force began to bleed through. There were impact plumes across the hull, venting atmosphere and detonations.

Hiad tried the communicator again, without success. He said a silent prayer for the crew of the *Spiteful*.

Then his communicator pipped.

‚Äú*Heavenfall*, report.‚Äù Halastars voice screeched out over a background interference.

‚ÄúClean that signal up!‚Äù Hiad yelled at his Comms officer, then activated his communicator*,* ‚ÄúYou took your bloody time, Halastar. We‚Äôre heavily damaged, and our shields don‚Äôt have much left in them. I can‚Äôt raise the *Spiteful*.‚Äù

‚ÄúCut drive and weapons,‚Äù Halastars voice rang out, ‚ÄúRaise your shields as high as you can. We‚Äôll be with you momentarily. Sorry about the delay, we stopped for coffee.‚Äù

Hiad laughed out loud, turning to his bridge crew.¬†

‚ÄúAll systems to zero power, except shield and life support‚Äù

The chorus of aye ayes came back, loud and strong.

The white lights in the bridge flickered out, replaced by the glow of red emergency lighting. On the main screens, Hiad watched as the enemy vessels closed in, firing relentlessly on the stricken cruisers. Then one of the enemy vessels, a destroyer class, suddenly broke off its vector, seeming to lose interest momentarily.

The enemy vessel turned slowly, breaking momentum. Hiad saw a second shape, a dark-gray knife on the navy backdrop of the void. It plunged, headlong and fast, into the side of the maneuvering enemy ship.

There was a flare of light, as two energy shields collided, grinding electromagnetic fields into one another. The two vessels were illuminated for the briefest moment, outlined by the profile of their shields. Then, detonation. The enemy vessel's shields blew out with a catastrophic failure, and the black knife of *The Fury* pushed through the vessel, wrapping it around its shield envelope like a crumpled cardboard box. Flames and nuclear reactor fire spewed from the stricken vessel as it deflagrated off the Terran battleship's second skin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Halastar, along with every soul aboard the *Fury*, struggled to brace themselves against the jarring impact.

Alarms sounded, and there was a titanic sound of creaking metal. The vessel shuddered as it passed through the debris field of the enemy vessel.¬†

‚ÄúReport!‚Äù Halastar cried out.

The Sensor ensign was the first to respond. ‚ÄúThree enemy vessels are vectoring to intercept us. They‚Äôre peeling off the cruisers for now.‚Äù

Halastar bared his teeth in a half-smile, half-growl.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

The sensor's ensign spoke up again, ‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôve got long range picking up a fleet vectoring towards us. Fifty ships, coming up from Iunthor.‚Äù

Halastar hesitated. That was either very good news, or very bad. Halastar activated his comm. ‚ÄúMarcus, are you feeling up for stretching your legs?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want the big one or the little one?‚Äù

Halastar brought *The Fury* in hard.¬†

‚ÄúFrigate wing, your job is to reinforce *The Gauntlet*. Leave *Heavenfall*, and *Spiteful* to us.

There was a chorus of affirmative responses over the fleet-com, and the seven Terran frigates split their vector off, making best speed towards the ailing *Gauntlet*.¬†

Halastar turned to his helmsman. ‚ÄúHelmsman, take us straight in. Gunnery load up all tubes and batteries.‚Äù

*This would have to be quick*, the shipmaster realized, *The other vessels don‚Äôt have long*.

Halastar weighed his options. They wanted to capture as many vessels as possible, but they could not wait for a boarding party to seize control without potentially losing ships of their own. With that in mind, four enemy vessels against two damaged cruisers and the *Fury* was hardly a guaranteed win. They had to turn the odds somehow.

‚ÄúSensors, give me a full scan sweep and profile of the enemy vessels.‚Äù

The young ensign, pale faced, but resolved, replied ‚ÄúEnemy vessel‚Äôs shields are up, but they‚Äôve taken some damage. I‚Äôm reading fluctuations in drive signatures that suggests they‚Äôre pushing their reactors hard. There is also indication of significant hull stress along the aft of vessel one and two.‚Äù

Halastar thought carefully, surveying the data as it scrolled across his display.¬†

*It would be a gamble*.

‚ÄúHelmsman, belay that last order.‚Äù He called out, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sending you a new vector.‚Äù

He quickly did the math, and typed out a course, sending it to the helmsman‚Äôs station.

The officer turned at looked at him, ‚ÄúConfirming intercept course, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúConfirmed.‚Äù Halastar replied, turning to face the other bridge officers, ‚ÄúNew orders, listen up! Engineering, take the safety limiters off the reactor, I need twenty points of extra yield. Shields, raise prow shield to maximum yield, draw down all other emitters to minimum. Master at arms, signal the prow compartments to evacuate.‚Äù

Now all the bridge stations were looking at him with uncertainty writ large on their expressions.

He looked each and every one of them in the eyes.¬†

‚ÄúSound the brace alarm, we‚Äôre going to ram these bastards.‚Äù

-----------------------------------------------

On the bridge of *Heavenfall* the situation was grim.¬†

Shipmaster Hiad listened to the chorus of calls ring out around him.

‚ÄúShields are falling at aft, port shields at ten percent!‚Äù An officer called.

Hiad turned to his Helmsman, ‚ÄúRoll us to present port shields.‚Äù

*It was hopeless*, he realized, his desperation overflowing, *We‚Äôre done*.

Their sensors, weapons and shields were all failing, and their gun batteries were next to empty. Soon enough their luck would run out and their shields would fail catastrophically, and a torpedo or projectile would end the fight with a flash of blinding light and pain.

The *Spiteful* was doing no better, he knew. They had stopped responding to hails ten minutes prior. Either their communications systems had been damaged, or‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBring up optical sensors on the main display, please.‚Äù

Hiad stood up from his bridge station, straightening his uniform as he did so. Despite the rising panic he felt in himself, he resolved to not show it in front of his officers. He was immensely proud of all of them, and he wouldn‚Äôt disgrace their efforts by breaking down.

On the main displays he saw the cruiser *Spiteful* taking a withering amount of fire. The vessel‚Äôs flickering shields stopped most of the shots, but as the energy envelope began to fail projectiles and kinetic force began to bleed through. There were impact plumes across the hull, venting atmosphere and detonations.

Hiad tried the communicator again, without success. He said a silent prayer for the crew of the *Spiteful*.

Then his communicator pipped.

‚Äú*Heavenfall*, report.‚Äù Halastars voice screeched out over a background interference.

‚ÄúClean that signal up!‚Äù Hiad yelled at his Comms officer, then activated his communicator*,* ‚ÄúYou took your bloody time, Halastar. We‚Äôre heavily damaged, and our shields don‚Äôt have much left in them. I can‚Äôt raise the *Spiteful*.‚Äù

‚ÄúCut drive and weapons,‚Äù Halastars voice rang out, ‚ÄúRaise your shields as high as you can. We‚Äôll be with you momentarily. Sorry about the delay, we stopped for coffee.‚Äù

Hiad laughed out loud, turning to his bridge crew.¬†

‚ÄúAll systems to zero power, except shield and life support‚Äù

The chorus of aye ayes came back, loud and strong.

The white lights in the bridge flickered out, replaced by the glow of red emergency lighting. On the main screens, Hiad watched as the enemy vessels closed in, firing relentlessly on the stricken cruisers. Then one of the enemy vessels, a destroyer class, suddenly broke off its vector, seeming to lose interest momentarily.

The enemy vessel turned slowly, breaking momentum. Hiad saw a second shape, a dark-gray knife on the navy backdrop of the void. It plunged, headlong and fast, into the side of the maneuvering enemy ship.

There was a flare of light, as two energy shields collided, grinding electromagnetic fields into one another. The two vessels were illuminated for the briefest moment, outlined by the profile of their shields. Then, detonation. The enemy vessel's shields blew out with a catastrophic failure, and the black knife of *The Fury* pushed through the vessel, wrapping it around its shield envelope like a crumpled cardboard box. Flames and nuclear reactor fire spewed from the stricken vessel as it deflagrated off the Terran battleship's second skin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Halastar, along with every soul aboard the *Fury*, struggled to brace themselves against the jarring impact.

Alarms sounded, and there was a titanic sound of creaking metal. The vessel shuddered as it passed through the debris field of the enemy vessel.¬†

‚ÄúReport!‚Äù Halastar cried out.

The Sensor ensign was the first to respond. ‚ÄúThree enemy vessels are vectoring to intercept us. They‚Äôre peeling off the cruisers for now.‚Äù

Halastar bared his teeth in a half-smile, half-growl.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

The sensor's ensign spoke up again, ‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôve got long range picking up a fleet vectoring towards us. Fifty ships, coming up from Iunthor.‚Äù

Now, I can't just call my doctor as I am a Canadian traveling in Japan right now. The first few days I chopped it up to diet change and time difference. Also, it's been hot here hard to stay properly hydrated.

So my question is is this just constipation from the above memtioned factors? Or should I be more concerned, when should I become concerned? I'm in no pain just uncomfortable and missing out on eating in Japan. So before I go to a Japanese ER what could I do to fix this! I've been drinking water and coffee but nothing so far!

Hi, Im really hoping I can get some help and advice on here.. maybe somebody has experienced what im going through. I'll do my best to break everything down but its hard to explain. My symptoms consist of..

A strong rush/sensation feeling like I'm going to collapse 
Pressure around my head
My mouth and face is tingling or tight sometimes feeling loose.
Blurry/double vision
Dizzy
Unable to sit still/fidgeting 
Trouble swallowing 
Severe insomnia 

I've been experiencing these symptoms that are sometimes mild and other times insufferable. I started having these 'episodes' when I was about 6 months pregnant, almost 3 years ago. They can last from 10 minutes to 6 hours. Ive seen 3 doctors about it and all of them have had blood work done, CT scans and physical exams and nothing comes back wrong. Ive tried to see a psychiatrist but have been on a waiting list for over a year. My current doctor has tried anxiety and depression medication but it doesnt help, he has subscribed me to take lorazepam if it becomes too unbearable but it doesnt really help if it gets severe. 

I have tried drinking more water and less coffee, no alcohol, less smoking, more exercise, less exercise, more vitamins, more salt, more sugar, basically anything relating to my diet I've tried and nothing helps.

I also want to mention I have dealt with anxiety and depression since I was in middle school (15 years) and know the difference between anxiety episodes/panic attacks and what whatever these are.. they feel completely different.

These episodes have been consistent for the last week like clockwork. It is emotionally, mentally and physically draining and some days I cant eat, sleep or properly take care of my daughter. Its taking its toll on my relationship with my long-time boyfriend, i know he cares and is worried but he doesn't know how to help. 

Please if anyone has suggestions or can help in anyway I would be more grateful than you can imagine.",1,1728170760.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1fx33fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1fx33fd/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_my_grandma_after_my/,I don't know how to handle my grandma after my dads passing,"I posted about my sudden loss of my father a few times by now, just trying to get my thoughts out of my head. First let me tell all of you, that this subreddit helped me a lot and I am very thankful for everyone giving me their perspective. Also: This is a long one but I think it needs that much context (although I also left a lot of things out).

I lost my dad suddenly a few months ago. He was not even for a week in the hospital before he passed. I was the one who called the ambulance after finding him in a miserable condition. It was very traumatizing for me.

My grandma, his mother, is giving me and my siblings kind of a hard time, since my dad went to the hospital. For context, my grandma is talking her whole life without a filter. Although she can be a lovely grandma, often times she just tells people what she thinks not considering their feelings of if it is her place to interfere. This lead to some people cutting her out of their lives, including her own brother. And especially in the last years she became more bitter, which all in all makes me harder to talk to her in general.

First of all, let me tell you that I totally understand her situation. I think it must be the worst feeling to loose your own child. I am trying to give her as much sympathy as I can give and always try to support her way of grieving, because everyone grieves differently.

But since my dad went to the hospital she was always telling us that she is the one with the most fear, not considering that all of us were fearing for our father. When he was put into artificial coma she told us on the first day: ""You know, I'm gonna visit him today. You don't have to come, he probably wouldn't notice that you are there anyways.""

When me and my siblings were planning the funeral, we tried to include her as much as possible, because we know she would be angry if we don't. On the one hand she wanted us to do anything, on the other hand she critized us for our decisions. One fight came up when she invited lots of people who didn't even know my dad to the funeral feast, although me and my siblings had to pay for it (and we don't have lot of money to spent).

The funeral was beautiful (for that kind of event), I think my dad would have really liked it and he is so proud of us how we handled all of that.

During all of this funeral planning, everytime we talked to our grandma, she always told us how much she suffers, but never really asked one of us how we were doing. We tried to look out for her but didn't get anything back from her. This hurt us a lot. She also was angry at us for contacting her brother informing him about my dads passing. My dad sometimes visited him helping him with computer stuff.

My process of grief looked like this: Right after his death, I was full on focus of funeral planning and emptying out his apartment. It was a lot to do, also with university stuff which just had to be done because of a deadline. After the most important things of the funeral were planned his death fully hit me, with a lot of guilt and so on. I cried a lot and went back to therapy more often. I was able to take some time off from work and used this time to heal. Right now I can think of my dad full of love, but there are still moments were I can't sleep because I think of him or I cry when I miss him. My birthday is this month and the last two weeks I am really struggeling thinking of my first birthday without him. In 2 weeks we will talk to his doctor about the autopsy report. I am not crying everyday, but my fathers passing ripped a huge part out of me...

My grandma is going to the cementary at least once a week, sometimes together with my uncle. She is also struggeling a lot (which is totally understandable) and cries a lot. Everytime when we talk about my dad she cries. We already recommend her looking for a therapist who can help her work through it, because realistically we can't.

One time I went to drink coffee with her and she told me: ""It was the best for him, to die. Because if he had survived, he would have been a nursing case, the doctors have said that."" I was very shocked by this that she told me this and was quiet for the rest of the coffee. It simply wasn't true, the doctors didn't say he would become a nursing case. They said they simply don't know yet. My grandma probably misunderstood or remembers it wrong.
I was hurt that someone tells me it was the best for him to die, because I knew he was working on having a better life and wanted to live. We found plans for that when we were emptying out his flat.
She also is everytime accuses my dads family doctor that he didn't notice something (although it wasn't possible to find something beforehand) and that he is a quack.

This was the moment where I decided I can't spent a lot of time with my grandma right now. For her it perfectly makes sense, but I can't hear stuff like that right now.

And right now everytime we talk she does not ask how me or my siblings are feeling. She even told me and one of my siblings: ""You don't seem to grieve, right?""

We tried to tell her that we grieve differently and we are all doing miserably.

Besides this she often critizes out of the blue our appearances, our households, our mother (my parents broke up but remained friends), the funeral (although she said it was wonderful before), and and and. One of my siblings is struggeling with her allergies right now and when I asked her how she was doing, my grandma interrupted and told us that she was having problems with her stomach.

I feel like a huge ass describing all of that. It sounds so selfish. But I am really trying my best to support her during her grieving process, but I noticed that I can't really handle it mentally, because I am trapped in my own grief.

I am just seeking for some advice how I can handle the situation. Should I ignore those hurtful comments, speak up or trying to explain her how things really were (like at the nursing care situation). Or should I look at myself for a few weeks and trying to avoid talks with her? I don't want to be her all alone in this (although she has many friends and my uncle), but I don't know if I can always remain strong hearing all those comments.",2,1728170431.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

Me and Elaine both hugged her and wished her good luck on her trip. She's such a hard working person and I love her for that haha.

Me and Elaine decided to go out to this nice cafe that had recently opened up.

""Hey Lainey you ready yet?"" I was waiting for Elaine to get dressed and I had noticed that it was cold outside. I decided to grab my jacket for good measure. 

""Hey honey, I'm ready! W-well? What do you think?"" Elaine was wearing the most huggable outfit I had ever seen (Kuro 2 outfit) and her blush made her look even more adorable. 

""Haha it looks great! You really have a great sense of fashion Elaine!"" She walked up to me until our faces were centimetres apart. Then she flicked my forehead.

""Gosh you always know how to embarrass me... but thank you :)"" 

We headed to the cafe and arrived within 10 minutes. 

""Wow it's nice! Very homely."" ""You're right darling, it's very welcoming. I really want to try the chocolate cake, oh and the coffee!"" I smiled at how excited Elaine was. I then ordered 2 slices of cake (1x cheese and 1x chocolate) and 2 cappuccinos. 

""Wow this is amazing isn't it honey?"". Elaine looked absolutely adorable as she was enjoying her chocolate cake. 

""Haha I always love seeing you this excited. Although, It's just a slice of chocolate cake you know Lainey?"" Elaine then frowned at me with a blush on her face.

""Hmph... you know what it is honey? It's because you haven't tried mine yet! Here..."" She used her spoon to get some cake and moved it towards me as if I was some kind of toddler!

""L-Lainey? Seriously? In public?"" Elaine laughed at how embarrassed I was.

""Oh come on now... you and I both know that you love this. You love being taken care of don't you?"" Suddenly, it was like a light bulb had gone off in her head. She smiled mischievously. ""Let's not forget how just the other day you were calling me momm-""

""Elaine! Fine I'll try the cake. Gosh you're such a tease sometimes."" I let her feed me a slice of the chocolate cake and it was really nice.

""See? Good right?"" Elaine had the most heartwarming smile I had ever seen. 

""Yep, guess you know your cakes haha"". I looked at Elaine's mouth and noticed there was some chocolate cake on it. It was my turn to get some payback. I took a napkin, reached over and wiped her mouth. She was surprised.

""W-what? H-hey... You could've just told me you know? I would've done it myself."" She started pouting in an adorable yet mature way.

""Haha and miss that look on your face? No way. I guess miss A-rank Bracer is a bit of a messy eater sometimes huh? I thought you were supposed to be the Sword Mai-"" Suddenly I could feel a death stare on me.

""Go on honey. Finish that sentence üòÅ"". 

""I'm sorry.""

We then finished our meals and decided to leave the cafe. There was still some time left in the day so we decided to go for a walk.

1fx2z5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1fx2z5o/passive_aggressive_table_envy/,Passive aggressive table envy.,"This morning I stopped off at a local park to have a coffee in the autumn sun. The place was quiet and I sat outside on one of the ten or so picnic tables. The only person outside was me. Lovely. Amlittle later I'm 75% of the way through my coffee and two couples, with 3 kids and a couple of grandparents turn up. They stand around shouting (ok, talking very loudly right beside me) for a few minutes while one of the elders and one of the men are ordering.inside.
Then one says ""Oh it would be great if we could get these tables together"" and from the corner of my eye I see her pointing at the one I'm sat on. This comment, however, is not addressed to me. She hovers about behind me making ""we can't all sit on one table, we will have to move the table, it's really not very good for us"" comments from a foot or two behind me. Not *to* me... Just near me.

Bear in mind there are 8-9 other empty tables outside, but they are not going to sit at those.

So I finish my coffee... And I do not move. Just keep reading Reddit, do a crossword clue or two, flick through the BBC news page. All the while they are hovering. 

Eventually their drinks and food starts coming out, and the all squeeze onto a single table with their brunch. They're all tucking in to bacon rolls and coffee.

And that's when I get up to leave. i take me cup in for the staff, visit the loo, and walk out past them. And sure enough, they are still squashed onto the one table because once they'd started eating it was too much hassle to move.

Had they asked, I'd have said no, but I'd have moved as soon as I'd finished, but they didn't. So I enjoyed the sun for another 10 minutes instead.",176,1728170082.0,pettyrevenge,11,0.99,False

Please read and provide feedback... (Am I the only one who sees this?)

What's good (not amazing but good.) about ""A Hit is a Hit"" (yes the band and Denmark is not great, but that's the point. )

The sopranos is obviously all about character: characters, character development, character interaction, conflict etc. 

Hit has this in spades. 

Heshs backstory, where he lives, his misdeeds. 

Ade showing a new side of herself, wanting more out of life, wanting to be more than a hostess. Basically wanting to prove she is valuable and has more to offer than her sexy image.

Chrissy showing how much he actually loves Adrianna, 

The hip hop character and his interesting lines, and motivations. 

It also has the first amazing drama scene of the series, between Chris and Ade at the end. It was heartbreaking and beautifully done. Chris did everything he could to make her dream come true, and most importantly, to encourage her effort to show she has her own value outside of her image. When people say he's a plain lowlife scum, refer them to this episode, and prove them wrong. 


Two Tonys:

Is so bad!!! (Compared to previous glory, still better than everything else out there)

It's so awkward and poorly done. 

The first scene with Chris and Paulie,  and Chris needlessly and weirdly insults Paulie for no reason while they're all laughing telling the story about the Russian. And they come almost to blows and one of them says it's over between them? Jesus Christ, could that be more clumsy and unreal?

The very first scene where Janice loses her wedding ring? Smooth, yeah we get it, you married Bobby Baccala. 

The bear and AJ literally crying ""mommy"" after acting all tough and rude around her in the same frickin scene? Again, sooo clumsy and awkward. 

Tony saying Ranger Rick is light in the Timberlands, that comes practically outta nowhere. Again awkward. 

Tony's dialogue with Carmela ""reminding"" us about Furio. That's network tv level exposition. And the exchange is so awkward (again it's all awkward) ...

Tony: I'm old fashion, I don't believe in divorce 

Carmela: yet your modern enough to use a cell phone to call Italy and threaten the guys life. (Remember, cell phones have been common for over seven years at this point)

Tony: that's right, certain people see him and he's a dead man. 

Carmela: he had coffee here Tony that's all. 

Tony: and now the coffee maker sucks,  how you like them apples? 

That's some of the worst dialogue ever really. 

Chris and Paulie shooting the waiter? So ridiculous. 

Tony going after Melfi romantically... hard to watch. It got weird. 

The only good thing in this episode was Feech. That character was amazing, true blue. A real character.

Should you? - Keep it simple or make it fancy (TL;DR yes, it depends)","This episode of Can you? Should you? Is a spin off of this [episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1fd5nl4/can_you_should_you_fairlife_chocolate_milk_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). In that episode, I sliced up three bananas and filled the rest of the container with Fairlife 2% chocolate milk.  It was a delicious treat. In later experiments, I discovered my favorite Creami so far is Fairlife 2% chocolate milk with a little bit of pudding (1 tsp for a frosty more for something closer to soft serve) and I next want to try a vanilla version. I think for the next episode in this series I am going to try different amounts of pudding and see how it affects texture and if there is a certain point where it just doesn't add anything to add more. 

What sparked the experiment that is the subject of this episode was whether a couple extra steps added to a simple recipe would boost the flavor profile.  And it certainly did that a couple extra steps exponentially increased the flavor and the richness. So in that aspect this was a successful experiment. Taking the extra steps (at least of adding a few extra ingredients), will get you a more flavorful final product. But for me, I liked the super simple version. I ate the entire container of the super simple version (bananas and 2% fairlife chocolate). The slightly more complicated version of adding four more ingredients and swapping freeze dried bananas for the fresh ones definitely upped the flavor and richness but it was too much for me. I took a couple of bites to taste it but I didn't want anymore after that. The complicated version that involved seeping the bananas and blooming the chocolate flavor didn't really add anything in terms of flavor. It may have been a little stronger on both the flavor and richness, but not enough to justify the seeping and the extra 12 hours in the fridge (in my opinion). And again, I could only take just a couple of bites and I didn't want any more. I definitely could not eat an entire container of either the more complicated versions. 

**Lessons Learned:** Freeze dried bananas provide a really strong banana flavor. Next time I would use like a quarter of what I used. The banana flavor was so strong it was almost unpleasant. I tasted both containers and even though I did want a treat. I didn't want to eat any more. And I was going to add some peanut butter when I spun it, but I didn't but I swear I could taste peanut butter in both batches. When  I did the creamsicle experiment, I thought it would be a good idea to have a flavor concentrate on hand that you could use to increase the flavor. This would be good for that. I ended up taking about a cup and a half of the final product and blending it in a blender with about equal parts of plain 2% fairlife. It was too thin for a shake or a smoothie, but husband liked the flavor of that better. I have that sitting in the freezer to be spun tomorrow. 

**For Next time**: I'm kind of banana'ed out at this point. It was a lot of banana flavor. But I think I will use freeze dried bananas from now on, just not as many. It's super convenient and you don't have to worry about them going bad. 

**The details:**

\[I'm saying this in my best Bruce Buffer voice\] In the red container...I added two cups of freeze dried bananas (I think it was like 85 grams). In a blender, I mixed 2% Chocolate Fairlife Milk with 1T dutch processed cocoa power, 1 T of table sugar, 1/2 t of instant coffee, and 1/8 t salt. I poured that over the freeze dried bananas. I was just going to freeze that but it didn't look right. So I allowed the freeze dried bananas to sort of soak in that mixture for like 15 minutes and then I blended it in a blender. I put that mixture straight into the freezer.

[freeze dried bananas in milk](https://preview.redd.it/wmr2k6wmm0td1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=731ebd1c68d898720b8d6bbed205b811dd8ddc78)

[Rehydrated bananas \(I didn't photograph the rest or if I did I can't find them\) before heating. Also don't come at me for my pans. I usually use cast iron \(straight and enameled\). But all my good pans were too big for this. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ir4vyqrm0td1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65d5e16fee0a8c43ba4be162c6bcee356d6e0203)

\[I'm saying this in my best Bruce Buffer voice\] In the blue container...it was a little more complicated. I put two cups of freeze dried bananas in a sauce pan with some 2% Chocolate Fairlife Milk and let them rehydrate and basically follow what¬†[](https://www.reddit.com/user/john_the_gun/)¬†recommended in the post I linked to earlier. After the freeze dried bananas were good and mushy, I added 1T dutch processed cocoa power, 1 T of table sugar, 1/2 t of instant coffee, 1/8 t salt, and a little more chocolate milk and keep them mildly heating for 15 mins. After that, I added the rest of the chocolate milk and let that mixture sit in the fridge for 12 hours and then I put it in the freezer.

[This is what the finished product looked like before freezing. The funny thing is that after sitting and freezing the blue container was significantly darker. ](https://preview.redd.it/tkcrgmi7n0td1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0f77cd44aa9a905c4a8a60adc4f2150c1598d41)

And then all hell broke loose, sorta. Work got super busy and I got sick (but still had to work cause busy). But two weeks or so later, work is still super crazy, but I am finally starting to feel better and thought it was time to spin it. So today was the day!

And....they tasted basically the same with a slight preference for the red container. My husband who had no idea about the experiment said they were both too chocolatey but tasted about the same and if he had to pick one, he picked the red. The Red container even though it was darker in this photo and lighter after freezing it was slightly darker after spinning. While the blue container was just the opposite (lighter before freezing, darker after freezing, and lighter after spinning). 

[The final result. ](https://preview.redd.it/rk93bed2o0td1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d5060e40fe0f2cfc11a3023e24824fa6a4e74ef)

My questions with all of this said are the future from here. What‚Äôs it look like? 

I‚Äôm expecting that I‚Äôll have to go for surgery since it‚Äôs considered large. Most likely I‚Äôll wait until my follow up endoscopy in a couple of months to make a decision on when to do so.

I‚Äôm planning on adjusting diet as I go, removing caffeine completely, eating more natural foods as I learn more about nutrition, etc. Are there any tips for diet?

I also know I have to keep exercise light as I attempt to lose weight. Currently I‚Äôm walking more often with time, but am wondering if there are any other exercises/practices I can incorporate in my daily/weekly routine to improve my health from here.

I‚Äôm also wondering if I‚Äôll ever be able to weightlifting/play intense sports again? If not during the next few months, is it only after surgery are these possibilities?

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 10-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

When I woke up my hand hadn't completely healed yet. After I called in to work, I spent most of the early afternoon kicking myself for not saying something to Tay yesterday. I didn't have much experience expressing gratitude, not like anyone ever does anything nice for me. After what she did, I owed her something better than a stuttered thank you, and I hated feeling indebted to people. I remembered what that viper said, that maybe she'd like some food or a friend. Yea, I don't think she's in the market for a friend, maybe an enemy, and food didn't work too well with Sammy... Spending too much time thinking about her again,¬†*that snake*‚Ä¶ and I guess Sammy too. It's not like I really cared about Tay, she's got a track record with me and one nice thing doesn't offset all that. Now, I was open to having my mind changed, but I doubted she would.

After scrolling through my game library on my computer and not doing anything for a few hours, I mustered the willpower to make myself something to eat. I slapped a few slices of bologna, a slice of that delicious highly-processed government cheese, and slathered some mayo, between two slices of white bread. Wasn't fine dining, but I didn't feel like cooking, I rarely did.

As soon as I took a bite, someone began to frantically pound on my door. The knocks resonated throughout my house. I quickly chewed up what was in my mouth and crept up my peephole to see who it was.

I relaxed when I saw three familiar goombahs outside. I opened the door and said, ""Guys? What the fuck are you doing here?""

Ray spoke first. ""Dude, you told us you had the day off this morning. You get amnesia from the grease burn?""

""Yea, I figured you'd get onlin‚Äî""

Josh cut me off and pointed one of his wide fingers at my sandwich. ""The real question is what are you eating? What, did you run out of spaghetti leftovers already?""

""I've been out of spaghetti for a few days now. You too blue-blooded for bologna? Sorry, I'm not eating foie gras.""

He chuckled ""Vro, how can you eat that garbage? The city has had access to real food for years.""

I shrugged. ""Ey, like my ma said:¬†*hunger is the best seasoning*. Think she got that from Plato or something."" I said, taking another bite of my sandwich.

""Actually, it was Socrates."" Dan corrected.

Ray uncrossed his arms and waved them in the air at Dan. ""Who cares who said that shit. I don't care if it was booga ooga from 10,000 BC."" He looked back at me. ""We're going on an I-R-L adventure, Vince, so put some clothes on and lets G - O.""

""Ok, where we goin?"" I asked through a bite of partially chewed sandwich.

""The mall.""

I swallowed. ""Yea? Quit bustin my balls, where are we really going?""

He raised his eyebrows and enunciated his words slowly. ""The - mall.""

""Why?""

""You'll find out, and ditch the sandwich before you get back. I don't want you getting shit on my baby's upholstery.""

I went back inside and devoured my sandwich as fast as I could before changing into my clothes and hopping into Ray's truck. It was a green Toyota Tundra from the late 2000's with a luxury beige leather interior. His truck was in surprisingly immaculate condition considering it had survived two wars with Advent. Ray drove and Josh rode shotgun, Dan and I took the back seats. As we drove to the mall, my friends were relentless with their hazing, for not saying something to Tay and for burning myself, before Daniel changed the subject.

""...so what are you gonna do for I.A Day?"" Dan asked.

""I don't know yet, vro, I don't even know if I have it off,"" Ray said as he drove.

""I don't know if I'm free either."" I agreed.

""Come on, it's I.A Day. Everyone has it off."" Josh remarked.

""Some of us like getting OT, Josh."" Ray said.

""Man, you're just gonna spend it on some girl you barely know. Stay off the dating apps for a few days and let's do something."" Josh said.

""Hey, that's not fair. I don't spend all my money on girls, I budget for it."" Ray said to defend himself.

""Yeah, and I'm budgeting for a car; something I can take for a ride more than once. Divert some of your funds.""

""*Dude*, you didn't have to go there. It's not my fault some girls just want a free meal out of me and the occasional one-night stand. I'll find a good chick someday, you'll see. Plus, I already got the nicest truck in the city, so what am I gonna save up for, a house? Yeah, right, the waiting list for those is a mile long.""

""I just had an idea,"" Dan said, interrupting their squabble. ""What if we all went to main street and celebrated with everyone else.""

I looked to my left at Dan. ""Come on, bro. Hanging out in a big crowd, that would suck. We'd get trampled before we'd have a good time.""

He shrugged. ""We've never gone though, maybe it would be fun. There's the parade, and the council gives a big speech, and then everyone dances in the streets. There'd be a bunch of girls there too, maybe you guys'll meet someone there.""

""You can meet girls anywhere,"" I said.

""You won't meet them hanging out at home,"" Josh said, throwing shade at me from the front.

""Damn dude, who shit in your Corn Flakes,"" I said.

He turned back in his seat and clenched his fist. ""Society shit in my Corn Flakes, Vince! Why do you think I'm a sigma male?""

""Because you're cursed with manlet genes that made you five foot six?""

He burst out laughing and couldn't contain himself.

Dan stifled his chuckles. ""I'd have to agree with Josh on this one. Online dating doesn't have a high success rate, so you'd be better off hanging out at a grocery store than at home.""

I chuckled. ""I've got better things to do than hang out at a grocery store... Speaking of which, why are we going to the mall again?""

Ray spoke up. ""It's killing two birds with a stone. ""

""What birds, vro? The mall is boring.""

""I know, the mall isn't the best, but hear me out, aight. You are now out of the house, and maybe you'll see a cute girl that'll make you forget all about Sammy and your fumble with the war criminal. Annnnd the food court is pretty solid.""

*I have been a little down in the dumps, maybe I haven't hid that well enough.*¬†""Really guys, I told ya I was fine. I'm well over Sammy, we only knew each other for a few weeks.""

Ray looked at me through the rearview mirror. ""Come on, dude, you're not pulling the wall over ol' raygun."" He paused for a moment. ""I know better than anyone the pain of rejection. I experience it almost weekly and it still kicks my ass. And, you, you're a novice to the game, so you got to be feeling like a sack 'a shit right now. I wouldn't be surprised if you were sleeping with that viper body pillow we got you as a joke.""

I chuckled nervously. ""Yea, wouldn't that be crazy... Alright fine, we can go to the mall and pick up chicks.""

""That's what I like to hear. After today I'm sure you'll feel better.""

""Uh, I will not be participating with the picking up of chicks, but I will happily be a wingman."" Dan stated.

""Yeah, yeah, we know¬†*Bridgette*¬†is your one and‚Äî¬†*SHIT!*""

Ray slammed on the brakes and I heard the squealing of tires. The inertia forced my face against Josh's seat. ""Fuck! What's going on?"" I said, half expecting someone to t-bone us.

Ray pointed wildly down the road. ""Y-You see that asshole? Fucker just completely ran a fucking red light! I almost hit him! Probably playing a game on his phone or texting, all these retards are always doing shit other than driving their¬†*fucking*¬†- cars.""

I looked up to see the back of a red car speeding off down the road to my right.

""Should we call the cops?"" Dan asked.

Ray sighed as he drove through the intersection. ""Nah, not worth it, they were gang bangers. I saw them all decked out in green, probably with La Raza or some shit.""

""Well shit,"" Josh muttered, ""guess we should just be glad they didn't shoot anyone.""

""Yeah."" Ray said.

The rest of the drive to the mall was uneventful. Ray found a good spot close to the entrance and parked his truck. As we walked inside I appreciated the Mall's exterior. It wasn't nothin fancy, just a tall square weathered stone building with windows at the top and a sign that said¬†*Water Tower Place*. There used to be more malls than this one, but after Advent invaded and we won our independence, most commercial buildings were destroyed, repurposed, or dismantled for resources. But through it all, this building stayed together and most of the interior was kept the same. The City council considers it a historical site. A piece of our past that represented prosperity in excess, a symbol of hope that we might once again return to times of plenty, or whatever shit they said on the news. To me it was just a warehouse full of a bunch of overpriced crap I wouldn't want to buy.

We walked inside. A few shops were right in the entrance, busy with activity. The smell of food, as greasy as it was tasty, beckoned us further inward. My eyes caught the glint of fluorescent lights off the glossy stone floors and two polished granite pillars on either side of the escalators in front of us. There were lots of people walking in and out of the foyer. We went further inside, past the heart of the mall, the atrium. Which was an open circular area, lit by natural light from the windows above, with silver ribbons dangling from the ceiling. It was set up to show off all the levels of the mall and the four glass elevators in the center. We rode one of the elevators up a few floors before we found a comfortable bench to sit on and hang out.

""I'm surprised we could find an open bench. Business is booming today"" I said.

Josh looked longingly at a coin shop across from us. ""I wish I had some real spending cash, but everything here is always so expensive.""

Dan chuckled. ""Some people would think you ran an ancient Macedonian bank with how many coins you already have.""

""I can't help myself. When I see cool shit - I buy it. It's a piece of pre-Advent history at a cheaper price than a new video game.""

""Dudes, direct your attention to the lower levels."" Ray said as he put his hands around his eyes like binoculars and looked over the ledge we were sitting near.

""Kay, what are we looking for, vro?"" I asked.

He continued to look down with his binocular hands. ""Chick, black leggins, blue coat.""

Josh chuckled. ""Found her, gah damn, what has she been eating? That's that fattest ass I've ever seen.""

""Right? Do you think she shits with that thing?"" Ray said, causing all of us to laugh.

I held back my laughter. ""Oh fuck, look at that fat guy, bro's drinking a milkshake and walking into the cheesecake factory.""

""That's probably the most exercise he's gotten all day."" Dan noted, with a chuckle.

""Don't judge a book by its cover. Maybe he's holding that shake for a friend."" Josh suggested.

""Maybe‚Ä¶"" I said, sitting back down on the bench. ""Alright, Ray, where's all these girls?""

""Hold your horses, dude...¬†*Bew ba ba bew.*¬†Hotties spotted - at - 12 o'clock.""

""Where?"" I asked.

""Shhhhh, don't make it obvious. If you act like a creep they'll never talk to you."" Ray gestured to a group of girls walking past the coin store with his eyes.

There were about four of them and they seemed to be about our ages.

""Alright, I see them,"" I whispered to Ray. ""What now?""

He held up a hand, ""Wait and watch.""

We watched them. The group of girls walked past the coin shop, and slightly further down before turning into a store called¬†*Ragstock*.

Ray clenched his fingers into a fist. ""Yes. All according to plan.""

""What plan Ray? You've never made a plan in your life."" Josh said.

""Oh, haven't I? I made one just as we walked in. Think about it, none of you asked why I decided we should sit here. Note the popular clothing store those girls went into, and how well positioned we are to wander in there and¬†*happen*¬†to meet them.""

Dan rubbed his chin. ""My, that's surprisingly clever, Ray.""

Ray raised his eyebrows. ""You guys really don't give me enough credit. Think about it, you can't approach girls out of nowhere without some sort of angle. No matter what I've tried, I always feel like I'm creepy if I just walk up to them and chat them up. We walk in there, act like we are browsing, then we happen to run into them and we've got something to start a conversation with that they're interested in: the store. What do you dudes think?""

I spoke first. ""I'm game, but‚Ä¶ so, like - what do I say to 'em? Ah, look at these jeans, what a deal‚Ä¶ give me your phone number. Like what the fuck am I supposed to do?""

""I'm gonna make it real easy. All four of us are going in there, you and I will talk to them, Vince. I'll start the conversation.""

""So, what are Dan and I supposed to do?"" Josh asked.

""Just‚Ä¶ act like you're shopping, and don't crowd the girls. It'll make 'em uncomfortable, might spook them too.""

""Are we trying to talk to girls or hunt deer, vro?"" Josh said with a chuckle. ""Should I cover up my scent and paint my face?""

Ray got a serious look on his face. ""It would surprise you how similar those activities are.""

""Alright, so you get the ball rolling, Ray, that I am 100% clear on, but what am I suppose to talk to 'em about?"" I asked.

""You've made friends before. Just talk to them about their interests, the things they like to do. Tell them what you like to do, it's not complicated.""

I was still drawing a blank. ""Give me an example.""

Ray sighed. ""Alright, so pretend you just met me, and I'm a hot girl with really fat tits."" Ray cupped his hands in front of his chest to emphasize his imaginary tits. ""We've been introduced already, what's the first thing you'd ask me?""

I scratched my head and shrugged. ""Uhh, what video games do got on your steam library?""

His hands slumped to his sides. ""No, see, it's good we did this. Never mention video games to a girl you just met. It's a gamble unless they're the type that¬†*does*¬†play games. But you've got a good chance of giving them¬†*the ick*¬†if you lead with that.""

*The ick?*¬†""So I should never let a girl find out I'm a gamer? That's not a relationship I want.""

He shook his head. ""No, no. I meant first impressions are important, you do¬†*not*¬†want to lead in with that. Girls read into the shit guys say way too much. Basically, if you lead in with you like video games, they're gonna overanalyze that and decide you actually said: I'm a shut-in who never leaves the house. Amigo, that's a bad idea. Try talking about any other interest. Movies and tv shows are ok. What do you like to do that you think may interest a chick?""

I tried to think of something interesting. ""I did make furniture there for a while‚Ä¶""

His face lit up. ""See, that's perfect. Shows you're handy and maybe a little artistic. You can work with that.""

""Artistic, or autistic?"" This question wasn't even a joke.

""Heh, artistic. Chicks¬†*dig*¬†creative types. That's why I learned how to play the guitar.""

That was a terrible example. Ray barely knew how to play¬†*Wonderwall*¬†on guitar, and I was actually good at making furniture. But, I didn't have the heart to say that right now. ""Ok, I think I got the picture. Let's go in.""

""If you feel confident, that's what's important. But remember, you are going in there to get a phone number. Imagine this is a game and you've just gotten a quest to get a girl's phone number. Never lose sight of that goal and try to direct the conversation towards that. Does that make sense?""

""A cringe way to frame it, but yea couldn't be any clearer.""

He slapped me on the shoulder, a spark of amusement in his eyes. ""Then let's go and get you a future date,¬†*romeo*.""

All four of us stood up and casually made our way over to the clothing store. Before we walked inside Ray whispered, ""Don't worry if you screw things up, dude. There's hundreds of girls in this mall, there's always plenty to try again with.""

I nodded.¬†*Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence.*

We walked into Ragstock. It seemed to be a used clothing store, and judging from the artwork and graffiti on the walls, it tried too hard to appeal to people my age.

The cashier, a bored-looking emo chick with a septum piercing and black hair that had green highlights, said ""Hey, welcome to Ragstock,"" in an uninterested way.

We all mumbled, ""Hey,"" as we browsed what was available. Josh and Dan looked at sweaters and Ray and I looked at the t-shirts close to where the group of girls were.

Ray poked me and whispered, ""Ok, which one are you interested in getting to know?""

I looked over at the girls. ""The, uhh... the blonde one. I guess?""

""Ok, watch the master work and follow my lead. When you see your opportunity, go and start talking to the blondie.""

Ray kept browsing the clothes and slowly worked his way to a rack near where the girls were. He pulled a shirt off the rack and held it up. ""This one looks nice. You girls see any good deals?

The group of girls looked at him and the brunette in a blue tank top said, ""They're doing a buy one get one free on the t-shirts. What are you looking for?""

He shrugged, ""I'm not sure, I've never been in here before. Wandering around with my friends. You been here before?""

She looked at her friends and they all nodded, ""Yeah, we, like, come here all the time. They always have good deals."" She held up a pink shirt with flowers and the words¬†*Tax Evasion*¬†bedazzled on it. ""You can't find stuff like this anywhere else.""

He laughed. ""Tax evasion? Do you even pay taxes?""

""Um, no, obviously because I'm thinking about buying this shirt."" The other three girls giggled with her.

""Ah, yes. I should have guessed that. So, what are you girls up to today? Aside from not paying your taxes.""

Ray kept jabbering away, enthralling the girls, or at least holding their attention by social obligation. It was impressive how long he could manage to talk about nothing, but now came the hard part: finding the balls to walk up and talk to that random blonde chick.

*What could I even say to that chick? What should I say to her? FUCK, all those visual novels and dating simulators didn't prepare me for shit. God, he's still talking... Wait, that's perfect.*¬†I mustered what little confidence I had and walked up to the blonde girl.

She was wearing a green sweater and looked at me as soon as I got near her. I looked at Ray and back at her. ""Heh, once you get him to start talking, it's hard to get him to stop.""

Her brown eyes held a minimal level of curiosity in them. ""Are you guys friends?""

""Yea, and I got two more lookin at the sweaters. I‚Ä¶"" for a moment I was caught off guard by her looking into my eyes.¬†*Keep it together man.*¬†""My friends call me Vince. What's your name?""

""Makayla.""

""Ey, that's a cool name...""¬†*Fuck, what do I say now? We're in the mall, I'll just start with that. It's what Ray did.*¬†""You, uh, here to shop too, or are you just tagging along?""

""I'm shopping. What are¬†*you*¬†doing here?""

I shrugged. ""I mostly came along to get outta the house. Nice to get some fresh air, ya know. Heh...""

A wall of awkwardness hung between us like layers of thick overpriced sweaters and it only got thicker as neither of us said anything.

*Jeez, this girl is more introverted than me.*¬†""I, uh, haven't been to the mall in a while. I forgot how nice it looks.""

She nodded. ""Yeah, it is nice...""

*She isn't givin me anything to work with. It's like I'm talkin to a fuckin brick wall.*¬†My frustration overcame my reluctance for a moment. ""Not to sound weird, but I think you're cute."" As soon as I said¬†*cute*, surprise spread across her face and she looked down at the floor. ""Would you wanna exchange - digits?"" She kept staring at the floor for a few moments and said nothing.¬†*I think I broke her.*¬†I tried to make it less awkward. ""It's cool if you say no.""

She looked up at me and said, ""Ok.""

""Cool."" My body experienced an adrenalin rush as we exchanged numbers. I couldn't believe this was actually happening.¬†*Was it really this easy the whole time?*¬†My confidence surged and the next thing I said spilled out of me. ""You got any hobbies?""

She seemed caught off guard by my question and brushed some strands of hair out of her face. ""Oh, uhh... I like to read.""

""So you're into books, huh, that's cool. What kind? Fiction?""

""Yeah, I like to read post-apocalyptic novels. That's mainly what I read... post-apocalyptic novels.""

""That's kinda on the nose.""

Confusion spread across her face. ""What do you mean?""

""Uh, I'm just sayin we've been through like two apocalypses ourselves. When advent arrived and the war of independence. It's interesting you'd want to read about it.""

The confusion turned to determination. ""That is precisely why I read it. The content is relevant to our situation. There's knowledge we could gain from studying the content within older novels. Maybe...""

""Hey, Makayla. We're gonna check out. Are you coming?""

She spun her head to look at the girls and looked back at me. ""Sorry, gotta go.""

I held my hands up. ""Don' worry about it. We'll talk some other time.""

She smiled at me and ran off with her friends. Ray walked up to me and slapped me on the shoulder. ""Good work, dude. You were a natural.""

I took a deep breath. ""It feels like I'm gonna have a fuckin heart attack.""

He nodded. ""Yeah, that's the rush of putting yourself out there. It's fucking terrifying at first, but after a while, you learn to love it."" He cleared his throat. ""So, how'd it go?""

""Great. I got her number. She likes me, I think. I don't know if I need to get any more numbers today.""

I saw pity flash in his eyes for a moment. ""This is the part I was dreading to tell you, but you need to know the truth: getting¬†*a*¬†phone number from a girl is the easy part. Getting anywhere past the initial meeting is a hit or a miss..."" He paused for a moment and watched the girls leave the store. ""Did you text her to make sure the number was right?""

""Nnnno?""

He sighed. ""Girls can, and do, give out fake phone numbers to get away from dudes, so don't expect her to respond to you.""

*What?*¬†""But, she typed my number in too.""

""Speaking from experience, that doesn't mean anything. And even if that is her real number, she might never respond to you, and it's quite possible she might permanently ghost you after a while,¬†*if*¬†she responds.""

""Vro, what? If you really think she's gonna do that, why did we even come in here?""

""I don't want you to get your hopes crushed when that happens, I'm telling you how it is so you can prepare. Maybe she's your future wife; I have no idea. Point is, we are fishing, we cast our line and we hope we get a bite. Sometimes the fish will get away, but the point is to never get discouraged because I¬†*will*¬†catch one someday.""

""I? Ray?""

He rubbed the back of his head and laughed. ""Sorry, I meant we.¬†*We*¬†will catch one someday.""

""So, what now?""

""We look for another store, wait for more fish, and do it all over again.""

""I don't know If I can do this again, man.""

""It gets easier every time. Come on, Josh and Dan are probably bored.""

We walked up to see the two were buying some weird-looking multicolored woven sweaters. ""What are you guys buying?"" I asked.

Josh threw his sweater on after paying for it. ""They're called drug rugs, vro. They're comfy.""

Ray laughed. ""I can't believe you dudes actually bought something.""

""I think they look quite stylish."" Dan said as he put his on. ""This hip fashion will probably impress Bridgette.""

We left the store and walked around until we found another store. After sitting around we saw some girls go in, this time Josh took Ray's place. Josh got a number, but the broad I talked to wasn't interested. After doing this a few more times with some success, I needed a break, so we got some grub at the food court.

""Man, this pasta sucks."" I said, poking at my spaghetti with my fork.

""Vro, it was 50 shills, you really thought it'd taste good?"" Josh asked before taking a bite of his chicken sandwich.

""I dunno, it¬†*was*¬†cheap, but it smelled good. I thought I wouldn't have to choke it down. My Ma cooks better food for free.""

Dan chuckled, swallowing a bite of his pretzel. ""Maybe you should tell her to work there.""

""Nah, she couldn't, cooking for my Dad is a full-time job. Dude eats like it's his last meal - every - day.""

""That is surprising."" Dan said. ""I thought your Dad was really skinny?""

I nodded. ""Yea, he is. Got a, uhh, a fast metabolism, I think‚Ä¶ I can't take you seriously in that thing.""

""What do you mean? I look cool.""

I gestured to Dan and Josh. ""You guys look like you smoke weed and listen to indie music.""

Josh leaned over the table. ""Who cares."" He grabbed Dan by the shoulder. ""It's not like we're going to a job interview in them.""

Ray butted into the conversation. ""Hey, Vince. There's a cute girl sitting all by herself over there. Why don't you try and get her number?""

I looked where he gestured. There was a girl with black hair sitting at a table and drinking an iced coffee alone. She looked completely absorbed in her phone. ""I don't know, Ray. She kinda looks like she wants to be left alone. And I'm runnin outta gusto.""

He nodded. ""Alright, how about after we finish eating we hit one more place. I have an idea where we might find a weird girl for you, one that hopefully isn't an absolute ham planet. ""

""A weird girl? What the hell do you mean?""

""Well, you're weird, so maybe you'd like a weird girl more than a normal one."" Josh joked.

Ray nodded in agreement. ""Trust me, dude. The place I'm taking you, the girls that go there might like it if you tell them you're a gamer.""

That caught my attention. ""I'm listening.""

""Finish your gutter pasta and then we'll head over.""

""Nah, fuck it. I'm just gonna toss it. You guys done eating?"" I asked Josh and Dan.

""I'm good."" Dan said.

""Few more bites and I'm done."" Josh said.

Once they finished their food, Ray led us to the back of the mall and we came face to face with the iron gate of the mythical place that the ""weird girls"" visited.

""Hot - Topic?"" I said, making it clear I was confused.

""Hot topic."" Ray confirmed.

""Hot topic."" Josh said.

A song by Linkin Park drifted through the iron spider web styled gate and fake braziers. ""Ray, this store looks like a vampire sex shop. The font looks like something an edgy teenager would draw.""

""Dude, I know. Looks can be deceiving. They actually stock some cool merch in there, and I can guarantee there's no vampire sex toys.""

""So there's regular sex toys?""

""No, unless they started doing that recently... Look, I don't go in there all the time, like maybe once or twice I've had a look around.""

Dan cleared his throat. ""I think I read an article about Hot topic one time. This store has been around for a long time, it survived the arrival of Advent and this one has been kept in its original state. It's like a time capsule into 2015.""

Josh butted in. ""Ain't no way it's still the same store. You can't tell me the same motherfucker still owns it.""

Dan scratched his head. ""I believe someone bought the space after the war for independence and decided to keep the theme and sell the same stuff.""

I wasn't all that interested in the history. ""That's cool, I guess."" Suddenly, something pink inside the store caught my eye. I walked over to the left, and what I saw I almost couldn't believe. There was a sectoid working in that store, but it wasn't the sectoid itself that surprised me, it was what it looked like. It was wearing mostly black, and from what I could see it was curvy like a chick. It's breasts were average and it had an ass and hips. I quickly rejoined the boys to report my findings.

""Guys, you are¬†*not*¬†gonna believe this.""

""What?"" All three of them said in unison.

I lowered my voice to a whisper and pointed in the store. ""There is a fucking sectoid working in there. It has¬†*tits*¬†and it is¬†*caked up*¬†to the max.""

This caught Ray's attention. ""Sectoid with¬†*boobs*? Awe,¬†*come*¬†-¬†*on*! How come she wasn't working the two times I went in?""

I grabbed his shoulders. ""You're missing the point, Ray.¬†*Why*¬†does it have tits? I've never heard of Sectoids having boobs, I thought they didn't have anything to fuck¬†*with*.""

Josh shrugged. ""I've never seen or heard of that either.""

The three of us turned to look at Dan who was sipping on a cookie shake. He groaned. ""Why are you guys looking at me?""

""Dude, you know about these things."" Josh chuckled.

Dan's cheeks reddened. ""Yes, I have some knowledge on xenobiology, but I don't study their reproductive capabilities.""

""So, what¬†*do*¬†you know then?"" I asked.

He took a deep breath. ""Yes, as far as I know, Sectoids can't reproduce, and they don't have genitalia. In fact, when Advent first landed on Earth Sectoids didn't even have mouths. Why one would have the sexual characteristics of a human female is anyone's guess. Perhaps she is an Advent experiment.""

""They did it for muh dick."" Ray suggested with a laugh.

""I've heard of variants with the aliens before, but I've never heard of a sectoid with tits."" I said.

Josh had been quiet, and that was never a good thing because it meant he was scheming something. ""Hey Vince, I'll give you 200 shills if you get the sextoid's number.""

Dan facepalmed and shook his head. ""Please don't call it that.""

Ray's face lit up. ""Duuuuuuude, holy shit, you have to try.""

*God help me.*¬†""Guys, I don't know‚Ä¶""

""Dude, you've been talking to girls all day. Just pretend the sextoid is just another girl and try to get its number. I'll help you.""

Josh raised a finger. ""Ah, ah, ah, you've got to do it alone if you want the 200 shillings.""

""Fuck you, vro, I'm not goin in there alone. That thing'll melt my brain if I piss it off. I barely can talk to regular girls, let alone¬†*alien ones*.""

Josh grinned and waggled a finger at me. ""Now, now, Vince. Let's not be xenophobic, she may be a very nice lady.""

""I'm not like Ray - I can't just say whatever to her and ignore the threat of death."" I said.

""If you don't act like Ray you won't have to worry about her threatening to kill you."" Dan chimed in.

I scratched my chin. ""You may have a point, Dan.""

Ray laughed. ""High-risk, high-reward, fuckers. That's how the Raygun rolls ba-byyyy.""

We all laughed and I made up my mind. ""Alright, fine. I'll get her number, alone. You better be good for those shills, Josh.""

He held up a hand. ""Scout's honor, you'll get those shillings if you come out with her number.""

""Wish me luck guys, cuz I'm going in."" I said as I walked towards the store.

I am SO FRIGGEN tired of this $@@(:&!!!! Disease!!!! Felt so bad yesterday, couldn't sleep last night. Maybedosed off and on for a very few hours. I woke up hurting and feeling Like crap. But I have 2 of my grandchildren this weekend, so I forced myself up, took my meds, drank coffee. Slowly got ready and my hubby, my Service dog & I took the kids (girl 6, boy9) to a nice farm fall festival. Being out in the nice warm & fresh country air did make me over all feel better. The walking 
(even with my cane) really hurt my hips. back, legs, feet and other owey spots. But I pushed through. The ride home was cruel, as I got one muscle spasms after another.

Finally, we got home. And I fell into bed. Sleeping about 2 hours. My granddaughter woke me to ask me if she could watch TV. I went to bathroom and laid back down and that's when it REALLY HIT. One half of my body in major muscle spasms the other a big Charlie Horse. The arthritis in my hands, wrists etc is on fire üî• with sharp tingly shooting pains. My arches in my feet and ig toes are pulling so tight. The muscles in my legs are hard as rocks. Oh yeah my right Knee is just well forget it‚Ä¶ a league of its own. I just want to cry. My hubby is doing so good taking care of them on his own. But I feel guilty. I want to play with them it every fiber of strength was used this morning. ALL my SPOONS are GONE. Beyond gone.

I've been with my current company for almost 2 years, and my experience working with leaders has actually been pretty good. They seem open and receptive to my ideas and value my experience. I am even in the process of pitching a new role within the company that is within operations that has an analytics focus - this is something I've seen more and more in the operations space and I'd love to intoduce this type of role in my current company. 

I've been extremely high performing in my role, I've done a complete overhaul of processes and comp plan within the sales team that I support. I've automated so many things and provided dashboards for metrics which is a huge time savings for leaders and commissions teams at the end of quarters (and even forcasting models to help the team achieve their quota).

My gripe is with my immediate peers. Others on the same team, at my level who have different focus areas treat me like an outsider because I am relatively new to this company (almost 2 years in). The other managers at my level have been there since they graduated college and have literally worked no where else other than this company. I feel they lack a ton of perspective only having tunnel vision for how things are done at this company and when I make suggestions or share insights, they devalue everything I say. It's incredibly frustrating and feels like a ""mean girls"" club - their not all girls but this is the vibe. They only value the inputs from the legacy people who are all in the same boat and have very thorough knowledge of this one company in particular without any perception of how things are done in other businesses. 

Since I work fully remote, the impact this has is less than if I was in person every day, but I have thought about quitting multiple times. This company is extremely traditional in the way they promote people so tenure is definitely a factor, even if the individual isn't super talented or invests any time in learning additional skills to round them out as a professional. They just know all things related to this company in particular, which I personally don't think is super relavent to other roles outside of the org (it's SaaS, so specifics relating to contracting protocol, products, booking rules, etc.) So yeah, the legacy knowledge is great for this company, but plug them in somewhere else and they don't know shit. 

I've been interviewing with another company that I feel pretty confident I'll receive another offer for. It would be an advancement in title, and maybe around 20% increase with equity. Unfortunately, this company is not a big name and not sure if leaving would be a good idea. Yeah more money up front, but if the economy doesn't improve there could be a risk of layoff where as if I stayed I would definitely be more stable, 

perhaps my peers don't like me because I'm threatening, or simply because I'm an outsider and they've already formed a tight clique and I just can't get their acceptance. Not having a team camraderie amongst my peers is super annoying sometimes. I have made an effort to have coffee chats, lend a hand on projects that are completely out of the scope of my role just to be a team player, etc, and still I'm an outcast, 

Ive had convos with my manager about developing a new role within the org, but even if that happens I'll still only get my performance based increase of 5% or so even if I get promoted. So it will take YEARS to get to the level that I'm striving for, the pay range I'm striving for. 

I am all for stability, this company doesn't have a reputation for layoffs, so there's that. BUT, If I land another role focused on my talents and areas of expertise I could be looking at a significant pay increase but risk stability. 

TLDR: Peers at my current company are kind of jerks, and there's a long timeline for advancement & promotion. I like my managers and they seem to be supportive but I hate my peers. Should I stick it out, or get out of here ASAP??? ",1,1728169122.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
