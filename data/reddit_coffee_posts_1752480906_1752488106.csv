I'm not sure whether this is the right forum for this but will give it a shot. I live in Sydney with my partner and kids in a comfortable home in a nice area. We have an acquaintance who moved here to study but wanted to stay with us until he figured it out. 

It has been 6 weeks now and I know it takes time but I'm kind of tired of having someone home who doesn't contribute financially in this economy. 

We have have been paying for groceries, dinners out etc etc. he comes from money so I don't think that is an issue. I have been cooking meals for him as well. 
It's gonna be 2 months soon with no rental on the horizon. 

My friend and family think this person has gotten to comfortable and won't leave easily. While I don't want to kick them out as they are nice.... I can't have a freeloader around too as I don't want to have resentment build up. 

This is what I was gonna propose on the 2 month mark and let me know if you think that's fair. 

Pay $550 a week for living with us (rent for a studio /1 bedroom in our area is $500 to 650). I will provide dinners 5 nights a week atleast, whatever I make for the family) 

This would also include gas, electricity, internet and whatever furniture we have in the room already. He also has access to a bathroom that only he uses.

I have a cleaner coming once a fortnight and they clean the whole house so he basically just needs to keep his room and bathroom tidy and neat. 

I guess the only thing is expect is for them to treat the common areas with respect and vaccum once in a while when free. Also if he can help with small tasks like unloading the dish washer helping with the dishes. this would probably be one task a day of he is free. 

I would also expect him to cook/figure out his own breakfast and lunch if I don't have enough leftovers from the night before. (I work full time ) 

Honestly it's not like this makes us any money (profit). The room the guest uses right now is my study/guest bedroom. I have to give them access to this all day and had made me OR my husband have to go into the office everyday (I currently need to only go in once a fortnight and my husband company encourages WFH). This costs money ( opal travel + a coffee here and there ) and also makes me tired running around. While my husband and 

He is around 24 years old so not very young.

Here (Australia) they order quarter strength coffees (a flat white and long black respectively), and anything stronger (even half strength) is too strong for them.

Whether you’re a UX designer, developer, solo-founder, or tech entrepreneur, this* [*tutorial will help you launch a SaaS business*](https://www.setproduct.com/blog/start-a-saas-business-with-no-money) *on a shoestring budget.*

# How to start a SaaS business with no money (and keep your sanity)

Let’s get one thing straight: You’re broke. You’re not Elon Musk.

You don’t have $10 million lying around to burn on developers, designers, or ads.

However, starting a SaaS business with zero dollars isn’t just possible; it’s a rite of passage for solo-founders who want to avoid becoming the next cautionary tale about “runway” and “burn rate.”

[**This guide**](https://www.setproduct.com/blog/start-a-saas-business-with-no-money) isn’t about shortcuts. It’s about grinding smarter, not harder, and leveraging the cheapest resource you’ve got: your ability to ask people annoying questions and listen.

# Step 1: Validate the market first (Because your idea might be garbage)

You’ve probably heard the advice: “Build it and they will come.” That’s the kind of garbage that gets you featured in a Reddit thread titled “Why I Quit My SaaS Dream After Burning $50K” The first rule of starting a SaaS business with no money is to test the market before writing a single line of code.

Here’s how:

1. ***Build a landing page.*** Use Carrd, Webflow, or even Notion. Don’t overthink the design, just slap a headline like “This App Solves \[X Problem\]” and add a “Request Access” button.
2. ***Find 10 people who might care.*** Reddit communities, LinkedIn groups, or Twitter DMs work. Ask them, “Can I buy you coffee if you spend 15 minutes telling me about your workday?” (Spoiler: They’ll say yes if you’re not creepy.)
3. ***Don’t pitch them → Ask them.*** A friend of mine who shared this thesis learned the hard way: Asking, “Would you pay for this?” is biased. Instead, say, “What’s the worst part of your job?” or “What tools make you want to throw your laptop out the window?”

If 10 people tell you the same pain point, you’ve got yourself a problem worth solving.

If they shrug and say, “Meh,” go back to the drawing board.

https://preview.redd.it/ly6dembqctcf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=880f99b644c0cc038f4f256d330ef9215a2fc358

# Step 2: Build the ugliest MVP that works

Once you’ve confirmed people actually have the problem you’re tackling, it’s time to build the MVP. And by “build,” I mean crappy wireframes, not a polished product.

**Why wireframes first?** Because you’re a broke founder, not a billionaire with a team of 10. Tools like Figma (and reusable pack of [**Figma templates**](https://www.setproduct.com/all)) let you sketch screens in 2–4 weeks.

Here’s what to include:

* A **signup/login** flow (keep it simple — no OAuth hell yet).
* The **one core feature** that solves the problem. For example, if you’re building a WhatsApp marketing tool, make sure users can send a single message and that’s it.
* A **payment screen** (use Stripe’s free plugins to simulate it).
* A **basic admin panel** to see user data.

Show these wireframes to your 10 interviewees. Ask, “Would you pay $50/month for this?” If they say no, dig into why. If they say yes, start a pre-order list.

***Pro tip:*** If you’re a UX designer who’s scared of code (like me), use no-code tools like Bubble or Glide. They’re not perfect, but they’ll let you test the idea without touching a keyboard.

# Step 3: Prioritize core features like your life depends on it

Most SaaS founders fail because they try to build a Ferrari when they should’ve built a skateboard.

**Focus on the bare minimum that solves the problem**.

Reddit’s top commenters agree:

* ***User signup/login*** must be frictionless. If someone can’t create an account in 30 seconds, you’ve already lost them.
* ***The core feature*** should be obvious. If your app does 10 things, pick the one that made users say, “Holy shit, this saves me hours.”
* ***Payments*** don’t need to be live yet. Just show a button that says “Pay Here” and track interest.
* ***Admin panels*** can be a Google Sheet for all I care. You’re not scaling yet — you’re trying not to die.

If you’re a developer, this means skipping animations, dark mode, and that “cool AI feature” you saw on Product Hunt. If you’re a UX designer, fight the urge to add 17 gradients to the dashboard.

# Step 4: Leverage Reddit, LinkedIn, and cold emails

You’ve validated the idea. You’ve built a janky MVP. Now how do you get customers?

You hustle.

The startup that hit $500K ARR in 8 months did it with:

* ***Reddit engagement:*** Post case studies in communities like r/Entrepreneur or r/SaaS. Share screenshots of your MVP and ask, “What’s wrong with this?”
* ***LinkedIn outreach:*** Find decision-makers at small Shopify brands. Comment on their posts. Send DMs like, “Your marketing strategy is missing WhatsApp. I built something that fixes that. Want to see?”
* ***Cold emails:*** Use [Hunter.io](http://Hunter.io) to scrape emails. Subject line: “Hey \[Name\], I built this thing to solve \[X problem\]. It’s free for now. Let me know if you want in.”

**Why this works?**

Cold emails and Reddit are free. LinkedIn doesn’t require a premium account for basic outreach. Partnerships with agencies? Offer them a 20% cut for referrals.

# Step 5: Avoid Google Ads like the plague (At least for now)

Here’s a hard truth: Google Ads validate keywords, not problems. If you spend $500 on ads for “dog shit lollipops,” you’ll find 1,000 weirdos who Google that phrase. But are they your audience? Probably not.

Reddit’s advice is clear: **Don’t use paid ads until you’ve nailed organic growth.** Why?

* Paid traffic is expensive.
* You’ll attract the “searcher” crowd, not the “problem-solver” crowd.
* Early-stage feedback from organic users is gold.

Instead, use the time you’d spend on ads to refine your messaging. Talk to customers. Fix the stuff they hate.

# Step 6: Embrace the grind (And never, ever give up)

You’ll hit walls. Users will ghost you. Your MVP will look like a toddler’s doodle. But quitting is the only guaranteed failure.

**How to stay sane:**

* ***Bet on UX:*** The ugliest MVP in the world can win if it solves a real problem.
* ***Iterate with users:*** One founder’s secret was showing early versions to 30 people and asking, “What’s the dumbest part of this?”
* ***Celebrate tiny wins:*** First pre-order? Buy yourself a beer. First paying customer? Cry-laugh into your laptop.

Remember: You’re not building a unicorn. You’re building a business that pays your bills.

# Step 7: Audit your UX before you launch

Even if you’re a solo-founder, developer, or designer, your app will have UX leaks. You’re too close to the code.

That’s where my service comes in. For $0, I’ll review your MVP and ask:

* “Why is this button green? No, really.”
* “Your pricing page? It’s boring. Let’s fix that.”
* “That ‘core feature’ — users can’t find it. Move it to the center.”

If you’re struggling with UX or need someone to check your startup, MVP, or fresh app for UX leaks, I’m here to help. I offer a service where I can review your product and provide actionable feedback. Just drop me an email at [**hello@setproduct.com**](mailto:hello@setproduct.com), and let’s get started.

# Bonus step: Use this free tool to bridge the gaps

Let’s say you’ve validated the market, built wireframes, and even got a few pre-orders. But now you’re staring at your MVP and thinking, “*This is a mess. How do I turn this into a real plan?*”

Here’s the deal: You don’t need a $200/hour consultant to tell you what to do next. [Use this free tool](https://www.bynapkin.com/tools/starting-a-business-with-no-money/) I found while Googling my own existential crisis. It’s called *byNapkin* (no, not a joke about napkin sketches, though that’s ironic), and it’s designed to give broke founders a step-by-step roadmap based on their idea.

Why this matters:

* It’s **free**, which aligns with your current financial status (zero dollars).
* It forces you to articulate your idea in a way that’s actionable, not vague.
* It’s built by someone who’s been there: struggling to start a business with no money.

If you’re a solo-founder who’s drowning in what to do next, this tool will act as your cheat code. Input your problem, and it’ll spit out a strategy that doesn’t involve selling a kidney to hire a CMO.

When I was 12, my parents gave me a pet dog for christmas and I named him Pete (this is super relevant for later).

2 years ago I moved to Canada and met a guy who told me about an amazing  D&D group he was in. It was a 4e game, so in hindsight, that was a major red flag. So I went to the session and it all went great for the first minute or so, we were hating on all sorts of minorities together, but then the DM started telling us that he hates homebrewed beer! So naturally I confronted him and explained that his point of view was clearly incorrect, and went to go sit back down but then he grabbed me and started railing me, right there in front of the group. I mean, I would have been fine with this in private, but not in front of the dice! So obviously, I made the only sensible choice and moved back to America.

Now fast forward to 2 months ago and I have finally gotten over my trauma, so I decide I should run a D&D game this time, then I can rail people! So I look online and find 3 players within my area and 40 single women, so I get a group sorted and set up a session zero ( with the 3 player, all I got from the women were STDs and court orders). The players, Pete (not my dog)(told you it was super relevant for later) the rouge, Tim the Sorlock-adin-zard-arian (totally legal, he even pointed to the pages I didn't read in the book) and Richard the goblin. So the party was facing off against my super duper mega evil BBEG Boe Jiden and Tim one-shots him on his first turn. Pete comlains that it isn't legal, I assure him it is, so then he decides to sneak attack Tim with a kitchen knife with which he is proficient as he is a chef. This leads to Tim and Pete killing each other, which leads me to another question, but not my main question, how do you dispose of bodies and get blood stains out of carpet? 

Anyway, so I leave the room to make a cup of coffee, when the Pinkertons burst through the window and kidnap me. They tell me I must finish my game I started in Canada or my DM liscence would be revoked as it was a paid game run by WoTC. So I finish the game (actually discovered a new exciting system to try out called FATAL) and get railed a bit more (videos found [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq5WXmQQooo&pp=ygUJcmljayByb2xs) ) and returned home to finish cleaning up my house. I returned home and found a piece of paper on the floor, which is the subject of this entire post; does anyone here know how to file taxes? And does Pathfinder fix this by doing them for you? I really want to give Daddy Trump my money as I believe he is the best president yet, so much so I wanna suck him off. I even model all my dnd characters after him, unless they are the BBEG, in which case they're always Boe Jiden. But no one notices that all my charaters are secretly Donald Trump. I even made several posts here about it in the hopes the other players would notice and realise. But yeah, I hate hebrew and sessions over 4 minutes in length.

**⚡️🤯 Monday 14/0**7

The week kicks off with the dreamy, sensitive **Pisces Moon** getting into a fight with the cool kids. It forms a jarring **square to both Venus and Uranus in Gemini**, creating a classic head-versus-heart conflict. Your intuition (Pisces) is clashing with a flood of new, chaotic information (Gemini).

It’s the feeling of knowing something in your gut but not being able to articulate it, leading to social awkwardness or feeling misunderstood. But just as the static gets too loud, the **Moon forms a flowing trine to Jupiter in Cancer.** This is a saving grace, a moment of profound emotional luck. A conversation with a loved one or a sudden wave of compassion can bring a sense of deep, nurturing security.

**🌊🤝 Tuesday 15/**07

A day of beautiful, watery harmony. The **Sun in Cancer forms a perfect trine to the Moon in Pisces.** This is a cosmic peace treaty between your conscious self and your emotional depths. Your intuition is sharp, your empathy is dialed up to eleven, and you can connect with others on an almost telepathic level.

A gorgeous day for heartfelt conversations, creative work that comes from the soul, and any kind of healing. If you need to make peace with someone, or with yourself, this is the day to do it.

**🚧🔥 Wednesday 16/**07

This one stings. Like every sudden reality check. The **Moon moves into fiery, impulsive Aries and immediately conjuncts both Saturn and Neptune.** A heavy, sobering, and potentially confusing combination. Your desire to act (Aries) is met with the weighty responsibility and limitations of Saturn, all while being shrouded in the disorienting fog of Neptune. You might feel blocked, pessimistic, or unsure of your own identity.

But it’s not all doom and gloom. The **Moon also sends out supportive sextiles to both Uranus and Pluto,** suggesting that if you can face the pressure head-on, you can have a radical breakthrough in your thinking and reclaim your power.

**⏪ DRAMA THURSDAY: MERCURY IS DEAD, LONG LIVE MERCURY ⏪**

This is the main event. **Mercury, the planet of communication, thought, and commerce, stations retrograde in the sign of Leo.** A three-week backward dance in Leo is all about the drama. *Think any musical number from Moulin Rouge. A bit too much, no rest for the brain, but oh look at the colors!* Expect misunderstandings to be theatrical, creative projects to hit a wall, and exes to slide back into your DMs with straight up unsolicited nudes. This isn't just about travel delays and tech glitches - it's a profound re-evaluation of our ego, our need for validation, and how we perform our identity for the world.

**Watch for how you feel on the stage of life. How are you made to feel by the supporting cast. Is the set design about to collapse? Is the audience asleep? It’s time to review the script of your life.**

**🐂👿 Friday 18/**07

The **Moon moves into stubborn, sensual Taurus and immediately squares off with Pluto in Aquarius.** This is a day of intense, fixed power struggles. Your personal need for tangible, real-world security and comfort (Taurus) is in direct conflict with the overwhelming forces of collective, ideological change (Aquarius). This could manifest as a personal fight over money and resources, or a larger struggle against a system that feels oppressive and dehumanizing. Don’t expect anyone to back down today.

**🤬🛠️ Saturday 19/**07

Everyone’s favorite on the menu today: Mixed signals. The **Taurus Moon squares a now-retrograde Mercury in Leo,** making conversations frustrating and ego-driven. It’s hard to see eye-to-eye when everyone is clinging to their own perspective. But, the **Moon also forms a beautiful, productive trine to Mars in Virgo.** This gives you the energy and focus to ignore the drama and get shit done. It’s a great day to channel any frustration into a practical, detail-oriented project. Tune out the noise and organize your fucking closet.

**🤪✨ Sunday 20/0**7

The week closes with a jolt as the **Moon moves into Gemini and conjuncts Uranus.** Expect shocking news, brilliant but scattered ideas, and a high-frequency buzz of nervous energy. It's a day for embracing the unexpected and letting your freak flag fly. The **Moon also sextiles Neptune and Saturn in Aries,** suggesting that you can ground these flashes of genius in a new sense of purpose and spiritual understanding. It’s a weird, electric, and surprisingly profound end to a chaotic week.

1lzi8d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lzi8d5/miss_her_now_shouldve_shown_more_effort/,Miss her now! Should’ve shown more effort,"Hi guys!

I need to get something off my chest, i work in my company (its not a company but like a research-institute at my uni, and i work here with total 7 people in single room office).

And this is in germany, so 6 of them are germans and speak german all the time and i feel left out.

About me, i am really introverted and kind of shy but i talk like a pro when someone starts a convo or atleast show interest in talking i hope you get it!

So fast forward there was this girl she joining our office ( she was from prague) for two months
She didn’t know german either, so at start we hit it of and talked sometimes, went to coffee together one time too, but after some time it just went off between us idk why, it just stopped whatever was going on! But still we used ask each other for snacks or so till a month into her time but after that it just went complete off!

She was really so genuine and so caring and actually pushed me to talk in the start when i could finally open up with her,

Yesterday was her last day and i couldnt go this week to office due to some personal reason

I just feel so fuking sad and like just genuinely down as i should have put more effort and showed more care towards her maybe!? 

Because thing is no one here talks to you unless you speak their language (just in the case of my office) maybe they’ll talk a little but thats it and no one talked to her either and i felt she was so full of life

I just feel like i should have talked to her you know i mean even just as friends because it just feels like i shouldve been the one to make her feel included here and idk why due to my introvertness or what i just didn’t and i just feel so down now as i dont have her cell or anything, she is just..gone

Well that was it i hope i see her someday

(Though i know her insta should i semd the req? Idk)

Now i see her seat and miss her so much😭",1,1752486576.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1lzi6qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DandysWorld_/comments/1lzi6qo/dandys_worldchanged/,Dandys World+Changed=,"SCENE: MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

RAZZLE: (Excitedly) Alright, Dazzle, let's see what our 'lucky' shift turns up tonight! Who knows, maybe we'll catch Teagan trying to steep Astro in her teacup again!

DAZZLE: (Gloomily) More likely we'll catch Scraps mistaking Vee for a giant scratching post. This job is just… soul-crushing. Watching everyone else live their best lives while we're stuck monitoring them.

RAZZLE: Hey, we get paid! And look! Room 7A! Someone's actually \*doing\* something!

DAZZLE: (Squints at the monitor) Looks like… Boxten, Brightney, and Finn. Probably another one of Finn's 'educational' sessions on the mating rituals of the blobfish.

The monitor shows Boxten, Brightney, and Finn in a brightly lit room. Finn is gesturing wildly, while Brightney is scribbling in a notebook. Boxten looks uncomfortable.

FINN: …and that, my friends, is why the male blobfish…

BRIGHTNEY: (Interrupting) Fascinating, Finn! But are you sure this is relevant to… oh, what was I working on again?

BOXTEN: (Timidly) I… I think you were trying to improve the building's energy efficiency, Brightney.

Suddenly, the image on the monitor flickers. A strange, viscous substance begins to spread across the floor in Room 7A. It's black and glossy, like wet latex.

RAZZLE: Whoa! What's happening to the floor?

DAZZLE: (Panicked) Is that… oil? Are they having an oil spill indoors?

FINN: (On the monitor, oblivious) …and the female then secretes a bioluminescent… WHOA! What in Neptune's beard is that stuff?

The latex begins to engulf Finn's fishbowl. He screams, a muffled sound. Brightney stares in horror as it creeps up her lamp stand.

BRIGHTNEY: What is… this?

BOXTEN: (On the monitor, near tears) I… I don't like this. I want to go home.

The latex consumes them. Their forms twist and contort, becoming smooth and shiny. Their features blur. Within seconds, they are unrecognizable, transformed into grotesque, latex versions of their former selves.

RAZZLE: (Stuttering) D-did you… did you see that?

DAZZLE: (Eyes wide with terror) They… they turned into… latex monsters! What the hell is going on here?

Another monitor flickers to life. Room 4B: Goob is giving Shelly a hug. The same black latex is spreading rapidly from under the door.

RAZZLE: Goob! Shelly! No!

DAZZLE: We have to get out of here! This isn't just a crazy shift; it's a death trap!

They scramble to their feet, knocking over coffee cups and papers in their haste. They race towards the door.

SCENE: HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Razzle and Dazzle sprint down the hallway, the sound of their conjoined footsteps echoing in the eerie silence. They pass Vee's gameshow studio. She's still on air, but the latex is creeping up the walls behind her.

VEE: (On a monitor screen, her voice distorted) And now, for our final round: Survival!… Wait, what's this goo?

They burst through the main doors and into the lobby.

SCENE: LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The lobby is in chaos. Dandy is trying to protect Pebble, who is barking furiously at the advancing latex. Bassie is cowering behind a potted plant, whimpering. Bobette is trying to maintain a cheerful facade, but her ornaments are trembling.

BOBETTE: (Nervously) Oh dear, this isn't very… festive, is it?

Coal sits stoically, unfazed by the horror unfolding around him. Dandy is desperately trying to radio Arthur.

RAZZLE: Dandy! We have to go!

DAZZLE: It's too late! Look!

The latex is flooding the lobby. Transformed versions of Finn, Brightney, Goob, and Shelly shamble forward, their eyes vacant and black.

FINN-LATEX: (A distorted, gurgling sound) Joiinnnn… ussss…

BRIGHTNEY-LATEX: (Mechanical voice) Efficiiencccyyyy… must… be… maximizzzed…

DANDY: Pebble, run!

Pebble growls and snaps at the latex creatures, but Dandy scoops him up and they try to flee. A latex-covered hand reaches for them.

RAZZLE: We can't just leave them!

DAZZLE: We have to! It's every toon for himself!

They push open the front doors and stumble into the night.

SCENE: OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Razzle and Dazzle gasp for breath, watching in horror as the building is slowly consumed by the black latex. The lights flicker and die.

RAZZLE: (Sobbing) What have we done? We should have helped them!

DAZZLE: (Deadly serious) Helping them would have meant joining them. We made the right choice. The only choice.

They stare at the building, now a monstrous, pulsating mass of black latex.

RAZZLE: What do we do now?

DAZZLE: We run. We run as far as we can, and we never look back.

They turn and disappear into the night, the screams of their former friends echoing in their ears. Arthur Waltons legacy has become a nightmare.

FADE TO BLACK.

RAZZLE: (Excitedly) Alright, Dazzle, let's see what our 'lucky' shift turns up tonight! Who knows, maybe we'll catch Teagan trying to steep Astro in her teacup again!



DAZZLE: (Gloomily) More likely we'll catch Scraps mistaking Vee for a giant scratching post. This job is just… soul-crushing. Watching everyone else live their best lives while we're stuck monitoring them. 



RAZZLE: Hey, we get paid! And look! Room 7A! Someone's actually \*doing\* something! 



DAZZLE: (Squints at the monitor) Looks like… Boxten, Brightney, and Finn. Probably another one of Finn's 'educational' sessions on the mating rituals of the blobfish. 



The monitor shows Boxten, Brightney, and Finn in a brightly lit room. Finn is gesturing wildly, while Brightney is scribbling in a notebook. Boxten looks uncomfortable.



FINN: …and that, my friends, is why the male blobfish…



BRIGHTNEY: (Interrupting) Fascinating, Finn! But are you sure this is relevant to… oh, what was I working on again?



BOXTEN: (Timidly) I… I think you were trying to improve the building's energy efficiency, Brightney.



Suddenly, the image on the monitor flickers. A strange, viscous substance begins to spread across the floor in Room 7A. It's black and glossy, like wet latex.



RAZZLE: Whoa! What's happening to the floor?



DAZZLE: (Panicked) Is that… oil? Are they having an oil spill indoors?



FINN: (On the monitor, oblivious) …and the female then secretes a bioluminescent… WHOA! What in Neptune's beard is that stuff?



The latex begins to engulf Finn's fishbowl. He screams, a muffled sound. Brightney stares in horror as it creeps up her lamp stand.



BRIGHTNEY: What is… this?



BOXTEN: (On the monitor, near tears) I… I don't like this. I want to go home. 



The latex consumes them. Their forms twist and contort, becoming smooth and shiny. Their features blur. Within seconds, they are unrecognizable, transformed into grotesque, latex versions of their former selves.



RAZZLE: (Stuttering) D-did you… did you see that?



DAZZLE: (Eyes wide with terror) They… they turned into… latex monsters! What the hell is going on here?



Another monitor flickers to life. Room 4B: Goob is giving Shelly a hug. The same black latex is spreading rapidly from under the door.



RAZZLE: Goob! Shelly! No!



DAZZLE: We have to get out of here! This isn't just a crazy shift; it's a death trap!



They scramble to their feet, knocking over coffee cups and papers in their haste. They race towards the door.



SCENE: HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS



Razzle and Dazzle sprint down the hallway, the sound of their conjoined footsteps echoing in the eerie silence. They pass Vee's gameshow studio. She's still on air, but the latex is creeping up the walls behind her.



VEE: (On a monitor screen, her voice distorted) And now, for our final round: Survival!… Wait, what's this goo?



They burst through the main doors and into the lobby.



SCENE: LOBBY - CONTINUOUS



The lobby is in chaos. Dandy is trying to protect Pebble, who is barking furiously at the advancing latex. Bassie is cowering behind a potted plant, whimpering. Bobette is trying to maintain a cheerful facade, but her ornaments are trembling.



BOBETTE: (Nervously) Oh dear, this isn't very… festive, is it? 



Coal sits stoically, unfazed by the horror unfolding around him. Dandy is desperately trying to radio Arthur.



RAZZLE: Dandy! We have to go!



DAZZLE: It's too late! Look!



The latex is flooding the lobby. Transformed versions of Finn, Brightney, Goob, and Shelly shamble forward, their eyes vacant and black.



FINN-LATEX: (A distorted, gurgling sound) Joiinnnn… ussss…



BRIGHTNEY-LATEX: (Mechanical voice) Efficiiencccyyyy… must… be… maximizzzed…



DANDY: Pebble, run!



Pebble growls and snaps at the latex creatures, but Dandy scoops him up and they try to flee. A latex-covered hand reaches for them.



RAZZLE: We can't just leave them!



DAZZLE: We have to! It's every toon for himself! 



They push open the front doors and stumble into the night.



SCENE: OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS



Razzle and Dazzle gasp for breath, watching in horror as the building is slowly consumed by the black latex. The lights flicker and die.



RAZZLE: (Sobbing) What have we done? We should have helped them!



DAZZLE: (Deadly serious) Helping them would have meant joining them. We made the right choice. The only choice. 



They stare at the building, now a monstrous, pulsating mass of black latex.



RAZZLE: What do we do now?



DAZZLE: We run. We run as far as we can, and we never look back.



They turn and disappear into the night, the screams of their former friends echoing in their ears. Arthur Waltons legacy has become a nightmare.

I usually feel the urge right after drinking, and only a trickle comes out. Then 10 minutes later it comes back. Over and over again, and it never feels like my bladder is truly empty. And when I sit down on a chair, that's when it truly comes out and it's so frustrating. Though I've never had this happen to me in school/public for some reason. 

I don't know the relevance of this but I am Asian and lactose intolerant. I also kind of hated water growing up (I had neglectful parents and always had mold in my school water bottle so I grew up being grossed out by it), until now I'm drinking 3-4 glasses max. And that's usually 1-2 glasses of pure water and 2 of tea or whatever else I had lying around (chocolate drinks, coffee, lemonade etc). It doesn't happen at school or in public, but usually if I sit on a chair at home I would have a slight accident. 

I had a history of bladder issues until I was 7. I got in the hospital for a while and was constantly getting medicine and examinations to treat it, though I don't really remember the details. It was also an incontinence issue. I thought it was over by then. I don't know why it's suddenly happening again. 

Is there any way to fix this myself? I definitely don't want to pay for a whole doctor's appointment and furthur procedures just for this. ",2,1752485990.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Your smile is your signature. It influences first impressions, boosts self-esteem, and enhances your overall presence. However, if dental flaws keep you from smiling confidently, **cosmetic dentistry** can transform not just your teeth but your entire life. At **Silverlake Smiles**, our advanced cosmetic dental solutions in **Los Angeles** are designed to create beautiful, natural-looking smiles that reflect who you truly are.

# Understanding Cosmetic Dentistry

**Cosmetic dentistry** involves dental procedures aimed at improving the aesthetic appeal of your teeth, gums, and bite. While general dentistry focuses on oral hygiene and preventing or treating disease, cosmetic treatments are tailored to enhance the visual appearance of your smile while maintaining function.

At **Silverlake Smiles**, we combine modern technology, artistic precision, and personalized care to achieve exceptional results for every patient.

# Our Popular Cosmetic Dentistry Services

Here are some of the most sought-after cosmetic dental treatments offered at **Silverlake Smiles**:

# Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening is ideal for removing stains caused by coffee, tea, red wine, tobacco, or natural aging. Our advanced whitening systems deliver immediate, noticeable results safely and comfortably.

# Porcelain Veneers

Porcelain veneers are thin, custom-crafted shells that cover the front surface of teeth to correct discoloration, chips, gaps, or misalignment. They blend seamlessly with your natural teeth, creating a flawless and long-lasting smile.

# Invisalign

Invisalign clear aligners straighten teeth discreetly without the discomfort and appearance of traditional braces. They are removable, convenient, and effective for teens and adults looking to improve their smile alignment.

# Dental Bonding

Bonding is a quick, cost-effective solution for fixing minor imperfections such as chips, cracks, or gaps. Using tooth-colored resin, we restore your tooth’s shape and appearance in a single visit.

# Smile Makeovers

A comprehensive smile makeover combines multiple cosmetic treatments based on your unique goals and dental condition. Our team at **Silverlake Smiles** creates a detailed plan to deliver your dream smile with precision and care.

# Why Cosmetic Dentistry is Worth the Investment

# Supports Better Oral Health

Correcting misalignment, gaps, or damaged teeth reduces the risk of decay, gum disease, and other oral health issues, promoting long-term wellness.

# Provides Long-Lasting Results

With proper care, cosmetic treatments like veneers, bonding, or Invisalign offer results that last for years, providing excellent value and peace of mind.

1lzhx68,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lzhx68,Clipse x Pharrell - Let God Sort ‘Em Out - Lyrics discussion,"Alright yall now that we’ve had the weekend to listen to the album, let’s discuss *some* of the lyrics that piqued my interest/ caught my eye

Feel free to ignore my *skitzo* thoughts and comment which lyrics made you raise an eyebrow - and what they made you think of/ your interpretation 

{in quotations “” are the actual lyrics}

{In parentheses () are my random schitzo thoughts}

Track 1 **The birds don’t sing**

 (could be another entendre reference to an owl) (bird) (vulture)

“It was in gods hands ye was at Elon’s waiting to get with me “

“On my way to **Texas** that’s when Virginia hit me”

“Told you I was going to **Turks** for thanksgiving”

“The **birds** don’t sing, they screech in pain”

Track 2 “ **Chains and Whips** 

“Uncle said nigga you must be **sick** ” 

(reminds me of story of addidon where Pusha says **sick sick sick** )

“All you talk about is gettin rich”

“Choke my neck nigga and **ice** my bitch”

“Beat the system with **chains and whips** “

“ **Reality TV** is mud wrestlin” 

“I will close your **heaven** for the **hell** of it , you’d think it’d be valor amongst veterans, **I’m watchin your fame escape relevance** “

(Random thought I had but I think it’s “blasphemy” to call yourself a god, and Drake calls himself the **6 god** relevant only because there’s a lot of spiritually charged words and bars lately)

“You chasin a **feature** out of your **element** and **those lab diamonds are under inspection** ”

“ **The question marks** block your blessings” “there’s no **tombstones** in the desert”

 (X’s last album before he died is titled “?” )

“ **I know by now you get the message** ”

“ **it don’t take much to put two and two** ” (together, meaning its not hard to connect the dots)

“ **Your lucky streak is now losin you** ” “moneys dried up like a cuticle” “you’re gasping for air now it’s beautiful”

“Mamas is fallin out in **funerals** ” “ **embalmed and bloat they now viewin you** “ “ **they never find the guns, the sewers do** “

“ **Just a million trapped between skeletons** “

“ This the darkest I ever been”

“You ain’t thrive in the **snow** like it’s revenant “ “and **send orders back down**  and keep shoveling”

“I’m not the **candidate** to vibe with, I don’t fuck with the **kumbaya** shit, all that talent must be **godsent** “

“I send yo ass back to the **cosmics** ” 

(made me think of Travis Scott x Drake - sicko mode music video where Drake is in space and then a meteorite kills X)

“Then show up at your **gender reveal** ” “I son niggas I am **the general** “

“ **God** gave me light, a good year full of free will, **Trump card** told me **not to spare your life**  mother fucker”



Track 3 **P.O.V.**

“Run these **jewels** , there’s rules I don’t buy back”

“You **stream kings** but never fit a crowd in there”

“Supreme team, parallels when the powder clears” “I seen things that I’m still not proud to share, you **zues network** niggas hear me loud and clear”

“Shotgun wit ya ex, feels like **malcolms** near “

 (I’m probably **biased** but I felt throughout the album similar flows to **Malcom** James Mcormick aka **Mac Miller** ) 

(also Pharrell **and** Pusha T have both worked with Mac so it wouldn’t be crazy for them to pay homeage in some way) 

(also Kendrick mentioned Mac in the control verse and has made music with him before)

“ **Send a hit through a text ain’t no shouting here** “

 “little feature, niggas threaten to **sue** me?” “Tell your **lawyer** to set the fee”

“I’m not a tough guy I’m a flower boy them **bees** get you stung”

“I need **god** to play the lead in my biopic” “the curse of the zeros, when you become the **devil** or the tap dancing negro” “I came to terms that ima probably outgrow my heroes”


 “the rag top drop, playin hide and go seek “ “ **I’m watching new niggas rap just to OD**  

 (again made me think of Mac OD on fentanyl last Instagram live was him listening to the last song on his album “ **So it goes** also last music video is him smoking cigarette in a coffin)-

( Prince also OD on fent too, A$AP yams OD on opiates too - many other artists too but these are just off top Juice WRLD also had a seizure claimed to be because of Opiates - has album with Future titled WRLD on Drugs) - 

(Pharrell made music with Juice as well)  

(also Legends Never Die juice 5 year anniversary album dropped the same day July 11 2025 as Let God Sort Em Out which also featured a new song with Xxxtentacion)  

 (also these are just the thought I had because of the artist that I listen to so don’t take this as fact this is just what I hear from my perspective and speculation on repetitive themes- what resonates with me from the art but i wanna see yalls interpretation of the lyrics too)

“I was the only one to walk away and really be free, **I done sung along with rappers I never believed** ” “came back for the money that’s the **devil** in me” 

“ **Cause niggas chains just look like oppression to me** “ 

(reminds of the fact that so many artists are like slaves to the industry. Get used and abused and its like them chains instead of shackles are iced out Jewelry that is fronted to you by the label etc also many odd deaths when it comes to major artists trying to fight back the labels)


Track 4 : “ **So be it pt 2** “

Pusha “fuckin with **P** get something immediate” “your soul don’t like your body we help you free it”

“Then we wait for **TMZ to leak it**  , it ain’t no secrets so be it so be it” 

(so the bar sounds like a metaphor for killing someone, we will help you “free” your soul, and I guess TMZ would leak the info about the death, but then it follows it with “it ain’t no secrets” —- keep that in mind for the next time he brings up TMZ)

C l i-p-s-e. , “ **Epi** 8 ball, **LV** 

“I **monogram** like confetti, switches ready”

 (hmmm **monogram** = A monogram is a design made by combining two or more letters, usually initials, into a single, decorative symbol)

“Blow money, you owe money, we ain’t balanced” 

(Drake and his gambling/ UMG deals)

“You ain’t believe, **god** did, you ain’t **khaled**

 (made me think of Khaled saying Drake would be on his album then that coffin of RIP Drake was sent to one of his houses)

“Yall tweet, **bird talk** , we all parrots”

“Lone star we cross the border, cross the border we like **Dallas**

 (made me think of Drake moving to Texas after his house got “shot up” multiple times and got “flooded”)

“ **21** gun salute, we been **savage** “ 

(obviously 21 savage- who has been outspoken defending Drake)

(and **20** of them want you as a casualty, and **1** of them is actually next to you )

“Fly em in, fly em out. Only the baddest” 

“Ain’t no more neptunes, so **P’s Saturn** , off the first **ski** up, they re up, **its a pattern** “ 

(I know ski can refer to white girl aka coke but odd how we have been talking about ski mask and the backdoor etc - the lyrics that follow def made me raise an eyebrow though)

“Like **middle men** , they **killing em** you know what happened **ski** “

“You cried in front of me you died in front of me, **calabasas** **took your bitch** and your pride in front of me” “her **utopia** had moved right up the street”

 (so Drake also lived in calabasas but also the kardashians, Kanye is the obvious choice here, French Montana, Jada n will smith {only mentioned her cause Jada name is dropped in the lyrics later} , Jennifer Lopez, Justin Bieber, the WeekND had a house close to calabasas in **Hidden hills** Drake also had multiple properties there) 

“The net gone call it the way that they see it, but **I got the video** I can share and AE it”

 (the video of what ? And he says that he has the video… of Kanye ? Getting his pride took in front of him and **calabasas** taking his bitch? )

**They wouldn’t believe it but I can’t unsee it** (he can’t unsee what’s on the video… what tf is on that video ?)

**Lucky I ain’t TMZ it**
(So he says TMZ again when referring to the video that he can’t unsee… regarding people in calabasas- and yes i know Travis got with one of the kardashians and has a album titled Utopia)

Track 5: **Ace Trumpets**

“Yellow diamonds look like **pee pee** ”

“Bitches fly from D.C. on my private to Waikiki, **3** - peat” “ **niggas is my sons and that’s on repeat** “


“Look at them, him and him still waiting on **Yeezy** ” (ok so i guess we have confirmation that at least some of the bars are referring to Kanye)

“At your interviews I just Kiki” (Kim kardashian? Didn’t Drake also make a Kiki song or something when he was beefing w Drake ? Also wasn’t Kanye involved with Pusha T during his beef w Drake ?) 

“Life’s peachy A$AP with riri” (A$AP Rocky name drop and Rihanna)

“International flights connect me to the **WiFi** , that’s the only way you reach me”

“Never leave my home without my piece like im Mahatma , from **the tribe of Judah** I’m Mufasa”

“ **Never turn the other cheek you’ll die at the Oscar’s** “

“Persona non grata, mi casa su casa”

“Drugs killed my **teen spirit** welcome to **nirvanna** “ (rip Kurt cobain died by suicide but also had a lot of shady shit surrounding his death) 

Track 6: **All Things Considered** 

“V miscarried, we hid it” “Preorder the **strollers** ” “I pays for my stork wit the **baby** in it” “if the sky’s not tour limit, **you’ll never get it** ” 

“Turn niggas statistics, I’m so sadistic”

“So religious that’s so malicious” 

“No division still snow magicians” “Blitzing niggas for riches like fourth and inches” “ **pay attention and listen, the snakes hissin** “

“ **Niggas is writing statements and say they didn’t** “ 

“ **dream of taking you down, the hate hittin** “

“ **wanna show you around but they J Pr1ncing** “ ( **j pr1nce** name drop… )

“Blow a budget like fuck it, we gon tuck it **till it all falls down** ”

“When this **chess game** is played smarter, swear life is so awesome”

“All things considered **I been forgiven** ”

“ **writings was on the wall like hieroglyphics** “

“When **Jada** was asking why? I saw the vision”

“ **My homies that didn’t die** , was all in prison” (i done lost too many friends, 16 to be specific)

“ **Names was mentioned, explains the sentence** ” “pain is endless, **identifying the body, it takes forensics** ”

“Guns **Czechoslovakian** , it starts and ends it”

“The only sin left is to **flirt with Vengeance** ”

“Made my exit just to make my entrance”

“My old plug asked the new plug to reunite us”

Track 8: **E.B.I.T.D.A.** 

(this the song that gave me Mac miller vibes, especially pushas chorus but I can’t quite put my finger on it. Could just be similar production/ flows that I’m picking up) 

“ i mean yellow bright like vitamin C”

“ The Palais, the Eiffel, Army won’t turn the parades off”

“ **God Bless Takeoff** “ 

(So here we have Pharrell paying **Homeage** to **Takeoff** …  takeoff  died while with Quavo and after their split from **Offset** , rumors around J Pr1nce perhaps being involved (check my profile for my offset and other posts for offset/ juice and also offset defending Drake with T-pain back n forth)

“They don't know what it is when I'm on it
But once they figure it out, I don't want it”

“So far ahead, you niggas are behind
Behind”

“You can't see it from where you sitting”

“So far ahead (so far), you nigga are behind
Behind”

“ **your codefendant claim immunity** “

“ **it was you and he** , **how'd you not know?** 

“ *Unless he leaving court in a Bentley Sport
**Just to meet you on a yacht** , though “

(Strategy… Sun Tzu- The Art of war is considered one of the most influential books on military strategy)

“All my niggas like to draw so we all Picassos”

“ **Me just being me, Respect to PnB** “

(More talk to the dead -  PnB Rock getting backdoored or accidentally getting his location leaked by his girlfriend leading to his robbery/ death )

Track 13: **By the grace of god**


[Verse 1: Malice]
“ **The Devil's tapping on shoulders** “ 

(More Devil/ god talk, duality etc. Mac and juice would talk about this duality often) 

(not claiming this is who they are referring to just the first people that come to mind since they keep talkm bout death and dead people and god and the devil)

Feeling tired? Low energy? It could be your iron.

Iron is an essential mineral that must be obtained from food.

Its main role is helping transport oxygen through the body, and it’s also involved in energy metabolism, brain function, and immune support.

There are 2 types of iron:

**1. 𝙃𝙖𝙚𝙢 𝙞𝙧𝙤𝙣** – found in animal tissue like beef, lamb, kangaroo, chicken, fish, and offal. This form is more easily absorbed by the body.

**2. 𝙉𝙤𝙣-𝙝𝙖𝙚𝙢 𝙞𝙧𝙤𝙣**  – found in plant-based foods (like legumes, wholegrains, nuts, seeds, leafy greens) and animal by-products like eggs. This type isn’t absorbed as efficiently.

The body can store and recycle iron quite well, so deficiency often develops slowly — but mild iron deficiency is still the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide.

It can also be impacted by foods and drinks that reduce absorption:  
👉 Tea & coffee  
👉 Wine  
👉 Phytates (in wholegrains, legumes, seeds)  
👉 Calcium-rich foods  
👉 Egg yolks

These are all fine to include in your diet — just best kept a few hours away from iron-rich meals when possible.

On the flip side, pairing iron-rich foods with sources of **𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻 𝗖** (like capsicum, oranges, berries, tomato) or **𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻 𝗔** can help enhance absorption.

Iron needs vary based on age and gender. Women in their reproductive years need more to offset losses from menstruation.

**𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗶𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 (𝗥𝗗𝗜):**  
Men 19+: 8mg/day  
Women 19–50: 18mg/day  
Pregnant women: 27mg/day  
Women 51+: 8mg/day

Deficiency can lead to fatigue, dizziness, pale skin, low mood, and poor immunity. If you're experiencing these symptoms, it might be worth exploring your intake.

1lzhsjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearfulAvoidants/comments/1lzhsjy/confusion_after_intense_intimacy/,Confusion After Intense Intimacy,"Hey guys, I really need some outside perspective on a confusing and painful ""situationship"" I've been through recently. I'm left with so many doubts.
I met someone and we had intense chemistry and connection from the start. He showed a level of care and affection that made me feel really special. He was super attentive, doing acts of service that showed genuine concern for me. For example, once during a cyclone, no coffee shops were open and I had a headache. He went to two closed places, and without me even asking, he went to his friend's house just to get me coffee. That touched me deeply.
We had an intense first intimate encounter. After that, he pulled away and I did too. This is where things get even more confusing. He then called me over to his place, and the following episode marked me deeply.
The sexual intimacy between us was strong, and the desire reached an incredibly high point. He'd say things like ""I'm so turned on"" and ""I want to get inside you."" But at a crucial moment, at the peak of desire, when our eyes met and he looked at me (and I was looking at him), he just stopped having sex. Right after that, he started saying things that made me spiral: he called me a ""tough cookie,"" said I was very detached, cold, and treated him badly, and that he found me ""cold but hot, which really intrigued me.
From that point on, his behavior changed drastically. He started to pull away, devalue me, and say he ""couldn't do friends with benefits"" and that he ""had to respect himself."" Yet, it was he who had also said he wanted to be my friend.
After this intense encounter and his subsequent distancing, I tried to reach out to him specifically with the intention of being friends, believing his words. But when I did, he told me that what happened between us was ""circumstantial and just a moment thing,"" completely minimizing our shared intimacy. He insisted he always wanted to be my friend, but then he just ghosted me completely.
This contradiction shattered me. How can someone who demonstrates so much care and intense desire, who stops sex at its peak, then blame me, deny everything, and disappear? If he didn't like me, why all that effort, that desire, that intimacy? Why stop sex at the peak, if not out of fear? Why this need to blame me and call me ""cold""? My biggest pain is this subsequent denial and mixed messages about friendship, which makes me doubt everything and think: ""What if he just didn't like me?"" But at the same time, I remember the coffee during the cyclone, the ""cold but hot"" comment, his desire, and it just doesn't feel that simple.
I'm starting to think that maybe my own pulling away after our first intimate contact, which led to him doing ""hoovering"" (trying to pull me back in), might have triggered some deeper trauma in him. Maybe that's why he reacted so intensely when we reconnected and the intimacy peaked. It's hard to deal with anger and empathy at the same time, and I feel like this empathy for his trauma can pull me back into the cycle of not being able to forget him.
Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is it possible that he felt something so strong that it made him run away so drastically, to the point of not even being able to have casual sex or a friendship with someone who stirred so much in him? How can I detach from all this and move on with this confusion?

So I ended up going to Stone kind of spontaneously after a very intense work period this year — got a sick deal for the full weekend pass and just went for it. Honestly one of the best decisions I made this summer.

Sound, spatial syntax and stages:

Sound:

Wayyyy better this year. The whole setup made more sense: OK, arte was filming wtf but DJs are not on some weird God stage but they are totally partying with the people. Behind and in  front of them. It’s nice. I LIKE.

AAAAAnd the sound was actually good. Like properly improved. Blame OG? Didn’t hear anyone this yeat popping over for better sound. Altbough of course some stages have better setup than others. Let’s go:

Top stages for me:

* Kokerei – just epic. The open vibe + the weather = perfect.
* Bergschwimmbad – Pano Vibes Sexytime full of hot Borats
* Schwimmbad: yes, you could actually SWIM. Totally unexpected but such a nice vibe break mid-rave.
* Salzlager – way better than I remembered, strong sets and very immersive.
* Eisbahn – good artists (consistently tbh) but kinda annoying to get to, and somehow not easy to fully lose yourself there. Space synthax off

Food?

Tried most of it, best was the Korean stall but still overpriced for what it was. I ended up bringing nuts, fruits, protein bars — highly recommend doing that. Specialty Coffee was a good but 4,50 or so and No iced latte wtf 🏳️‍🌈💅 There’s really not much to rely on food-wise unless you wanna queue and spend too much. Then again they didn’t care about my picnic.

Music highlights:

* first time Quelza… I get it..
* Aurora Halal on Sunday – deep, almost emotional in parts. Aurora wir lieben dich
* Josie Rebelle – OG REPRESENT
* Ryan Elliott classy
* Fadi Mohamed: LOVED it but think Berghain or here Bergschwimmbad would be better for the flow of sound. Think he needs a better setup
* Marron  served  textures man.

vibe check

Felt real. Not too polished, not too influencer-y, no annoying brand presence everywhere. People were chill, open, beautiful in a quiet way. I met some amazing folks, danced for hours, had deep convos verbally and physically in between sets.

ContreauVersailles (the tea):

In NRW, you can usually not take your shirt off. The argument is that it is not cool since women don’t feel safe doing the same thing. Valid. However it is striking to me how Berghain treats this topic more on the grounds of letting everyone break free and feel hot in their bodies and be sexual. 🍑🥭🍉.I argue that the cause of sexual harassment on behalf of straight men lies precisely on the shame for their own bodies and inability to communicate their sexual needs with respect and elegance.

1lzhnfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1lzhnfa/why_net_development_outsourcing_still_dominates/,Why .NET Development Outsourcing Still Dominates in 2025 (And How to Do It Right),".NET may not be the shiny new toy in 2025, but guess what? It’s still one of the most in-demand, robust, and *profitable* ecosystems out there - especially when outsourced right. If you’ve been Googling phrases like *“is .NET worth learning in 2025?”*, *“best countries to outsource .NET development”*, or *“how to scale .NET apps with remote teams”*, you’re not alone. These queries are trending - and for good reason.

Here’s the twist: while newer stacks come and go with hype cycles, .NET quietly continues to power everything from enterprise apps to SaaS platforms. And outsourcing? It’s no longer just about cost-cutting - it’s a strategic play for talent, speed, and innovation.

Let’s peel back the layers of why .NET outsourcing is still king - and how to make sure you’re not just throwing money at a dev shop hoping for miracles.

# The Unshakeable Relevance of .NET

It’s easy to dismiss .NET as “legacy.” But that’s like calling electricity outdated because it was invented before you were born. .NET 8 and beyond have kept the platform agile, with support for cross-platform development via Blazor, performance boosts with Native AOT, and seamless Azure integration.

Here’s where the plot thickens: businesses *need* stability. They want performance. They want clean architecture and battle-tested security models. .NET delivers on all fronts. That’s why banks, hospitals, logistics firms, and even gaming companies still rely on it.

So when companies Google *“.NET or Node for enterprise?”* or *“best framework for long-term scalability,”* .NET often ends up on top - not because it’s trendy, but because it’s reliable.

# Why Outsource .NET Development in 2025?

**Because speed is the new currency.** Your competitors aren’t waiting for you to finish hiring that unicorn full-stack developer who also makes artisan coffee.

Outsourcing .NET dev work means:

* Access to niche skills fast (e.g., Blazor hybrid apps, SignalR real-time features, or enterprise microservices with gRPC)
* Immediate scalability (add 3 more developers? Done. No procurement nightmare.)
* Proven delivery pipelines (especially with companies who’ve been in this game for a while)

And yes - **cost-efficiency** still matters. But it’s the **time-to-market** that closes the deal. If you’re launching a B2B portal, internal ERP, or AI-powered medical system, outsourcing gets you from Figma to production faster than building in-house.

# The Catch: Outsourcing Is Only As Good As the Partner

You probably know someone who got burned by a vendor that overpromised and underdelivered. That's why smart outsourcing isn’t about picking the cheapest dev shop on Clutch.

You need a partner that understands **domain context**. One like **Abto Software**, known for tackling complex .NET applications with a mix of R&D-level precision and battle-hardened delivery models. They don’t just write code - they engage with architecture, DevOps, and even post-release evolution.

This is what separates a *vendor* from a *partner*. The good ones integrate like they’re part of your in-house team, not a code factory on another time zone.

# Tips for Outsourcing .NET Development Like a Pro

Forget the usual laundry list. Here’s the real deal:

**1. Think in sprints, not contracts.**  
Start small. Build trust. See what their CI/CD looks like. Check how fast they respond to changes. If your partner can’t demo a working feature in two weeks, that’s a red flag.

**2. Prioritize communication, not just code quality.**  
Even top-tier developers can derail a project if their documentation is poor or their team lead ghosts you. Agile doesn’t mean “surprise updates once a week.” You need visibility and daily alignment - especially in distributed teams.

**3. Ask about their testing philosophy.**  
.NET apps often integrate with payment systems, patient records, or internal CRMs. That’s mission-critical stuff. Your outsourced team better have a serious approach to integration tests, mocking strategies, and load testing.

**4. Check their repo hygiene.**  
It’s 2025. If they’re still pushing to `master` without peer reviews or use `password123` in connection strings - run.

# Developer to Developer: What Makes .NET a Joy to Work With?

As someone who has jumped between JavaScript fatigue, Python threading hell, and the occasional GoLang misadventure, I keep coming back to .NET when I need **predictable results**. It’s like returning to a well-kept garden - strong type safety, LINQ that makes querying data fun, and ASP.NET Core that plays nice with cloud-native practices.

There’s also the rise of **Blazor** \- finally making C# a first-class citizen in web UIs. You want to build interactive SPAs without learning another JS framework of the week? Blazor’s your ticket.

When clients or teams ask *“why .NET when everyone is going JAMstack?”* I tell them: if your app handles money, medicine, or logistics - skip the hype. Go with what’s proven.

# Outsourcing .NET: Not Just for Enterprises

Even startups are jumping on the .NET outsourcing bandwagon. The learning curve is gentle, the documentation is abundant, and the ecosystem supports both monoliths and microservices.

Plus, with MAUI gaining traction, startups can ship cross-platform mobile apps *with the same codebase as their backend.* That's not just time-saving - it’s budget-friendly.

When you partner with the right development house, you’re not just buying code - you’re buying **architecture foresight**. You're buying experience with .NET Identity, Entity Framework Core tuning, and how to optimize Razor Pages for SEO. Try doing all that in-house with a 3-person dev team.

# Final Thought

.NET’s quiet dominance is no accident. It’s the tortoise that’s still winning the race - especially when paired with experienced outsourcing partners who know how to get things done. Whether you're building a digital banking solution, a remote healthcare portal, or a B2B marketplace, outsourcing .NET development in 2025 isn’t a fallback—**it’s a power move**.

If you’ve been hesitating, remember: the stack you choose will shape your velocity, reliability, and bottom line. Don’t sleep on .NET - and definitely don’t sleep on the teams that have mastered it.

So, developers and business owners alike - what’s your experience been with outsourcing .NET projects? Did it fly or flop? Let’s talk below.",1,1752484298.0,OutsourceDevHub,2,1.0,False

Carrie complains that S.H.I.E.L.D. have no business screwing up her day off from work.

In response, Nick Fury steps out of the shadows and retorts ""Then don't screw up my day at work, lady. Cuz then there's gonna be all kinds of screwing around that we just can't afford! Tell me everything you know about the incursions.""

""What- what the hell are you talking about? Pretty sure you've got the wrong person, I'm Carrie! I'm- I'm a horse trainer! And all I was trying to do today was water ski!""

""Is that so?""

""Yes!""

""Well.... a horse trainer should have no knowledge about the incursions, should she now?""

""And I don't! I've never even heard the word until you started saying it! An incur-incursion? What's that?""

""Alright, this is getting us nowhere, send her back.""

With that, Carrie is beamed back down to the lake she was abducted from.

""Well, it turns out, systematically kidnapping every person on Earth, asking them what they know when they most probably do not have any pertinent information is a very time consuming and inefficient method of gathering intel. We gotta try something else, gentlemen!"" Nick Fury finally realizes this after personally interviewing half of New York's population.

Fury calls the New Avengers to ask them what the fuck is going on.

""New Avengers! What the fuck is going on!?""

""We just met up with these guys that like the number four."" Yelena responds.

(Johnny in the distance, mostly out of mic range) No-no we are the-

""Sorry, Fury, one second. What? Oh. Ok. Yes they don't just like four. There are four of them so they are the Fantastic Four. So their logo is a four, yes, that's what's happening and it's.. it's logical, right? Like it makes so much sense.""

""Are these four friend or foe? Can we trust them Agent Belova?"" Fury asks.

""Oh, they seem so friendly. And so cute... they are wearing bright blue pajamas. One is made of rocks.""

""Alright, ask them if they know anything about the incursions.""

""Do you guys know incursion? Oh. Ok. No, Fury they do not know anything.""

""One of these days, someone is gonna know!""

""Yes, we are all hoping we get answers about the very real threat that is somewhere out there affecting people who are not us. It's super pressing. Goodbye, Fury.""

Fury decides to take a flight around space in his flying spy car while listening to Heart of Glass by Blondie. As he is flying, he sees Dr. Doom's ship and pulls up beside it and honks. Doom connects to Fury's speaker and speaks with him.

""What do you want, man?"" Doom asks.

""Do you know anything about the incursions?"" Fury asks back.

""Yeah.""

""You do?""

""Yeah dude. Those are fucked up. Like they're gonna end all of reality as we know it.""

""For real?""

""Oh, fuck yeah. Big shit heap of a deal, those incursions.""

""Well, how are we gonna stop them?""

""Uhh... yeah... we're not eye to eye at all, dude. I mean, first off, there's no we, okay? And there's no stopping them either. I'm a sorcerer and a tech genius... I'm Doctor Strange and Iron Man combined, comprenda? And way doper than either of  those chuckleheads. You should see how I keep wreckin' them in literally every universe I've been in thus far.

""Doom says no.""

""Fury says yes. And that's a Nicolas J. Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. type of yes.""

""Doom says no and that's a double-dog, no-takebacks-or-you-owe-me-flaming-hot-cheetos-and-a-pepsi-type of no."" Doom disconnects and warps to Earth.

""All S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel be advised, we have a new player in our universe and on course for Earth... Just a quick summary, he's a wannabe God with the temperament, adroitness, and negotiation acumen of a junior high student. But he's got a big ass ship that is in fact hailing from a foreign reality, so he deserves to be labelled a credible threat, difficult though it may be to take him seriously in the slightest.""

Doom lands on Earth and exits his ship while holding Franklin's hand.

""Guess who's apparently on this Earth, Franky?"" Doom asks.

""Mum and Dat?""

""Thaaaaat's riiiight! And we're gonna find them. I know they're somewhere here, in New York... because that's where everything goes down... and when we dooo, I'm gonna hold you in a Simba pose just to taunt them, then I'm gonna teleport away right before they can get to you...! Haahaha! Ooooohhh! I'm suuuch a bastaaaaaaard!!!"" Doom says as he slaps his own ass then winks and points at a random woman walking by who just curls her face up. Doom chooses to ignore her dismissal and walks in the opposite direction, trying to play it off and act unfazed.

""She just doesn't know what she's missing."" He mutters to himself.

""What?"" Franklin asks.

""DOOM SAID NOTHING.""

Meanwhile, the New Avengers and Fantastic Four are at Dairy Queen eating sundaes.

A reporter for the news walks into Dairy Queen to interview the superheroes. She is female and wearing a tight sweater.

""You look beautiful."" Johnny Storm says.

""My, well  thank you."" The reporter replies. Suddenly, a hole appears right through her chest. She falls to reveal she was murdered by none other than Father Albatross, a rogue clergyman who recalls everything ever confessed to him and returns at inopportune times to saddle people with a manifestation of their own guilt.

""You live a life of womanizing and hedonism, Johnathan Storm. Now you must witness a sexy babe die before you ever even got to fuck her! Trauma to offset all the years of unadulterated pleasure you were able to have. Next... I will have your ballsssss."" Father Albatross announces before flying away by spinning his head around really fast and bursting through the ceiling of the Dairy Queen.

""NOOOOOOOOO!"" Johnny screams.

Dr. Doom chills at a coffee shop with Franklin and starts researching the Earth he has landed on. He discovers Tony Stark died in this reality to destroy Thanos and his army.

""Damn! Iron Man is dead in this reality... the fuck? I wanted to kill him. Almost feels like this universe is past its prime. Let's see if it at least has some hot babes.""

Doom makes a Tinder profile and takes selfies with Franklin.

""Chicks love dudes with a fathering side. You're gonna help me get so many matches, you don't even know. They'll see right past the mask, fo sho!""

""Don't you know I'm a reality warper? I could also help you get matches by just.. fixing your face."" Franklin suggests.

""Oh shit. Wait... dude... I got the perfect idea. Make me look like Tony Stark. I can convince everyone I'm him and that reality alterations due to the incursions brought me back to life.""

""Sure.""

Franklin waves his hand around and transforms Doom's physical form to be that of Tony Stark's. He runs to the bathroom of the coffee shop and looks in the mirror.

""HOLY SHIT."" Doom yells.

""HOLY SHIT!"" A random guy yells as he exits the stall.

""I THOUGHT YOU DIED!""

""Reports of my death were greatly exaggerated."" Doom replies.

""Diggin' the new threads. What is it like some renaissance fair thing?""

""Whoa, whoa, whoa... DOOM is not dressed this way for the sake of facetious dalliances, DOOM is adorned with-- ahem.. sorry. Yeah. Yeah. You know me, good ol' Tony Stark! Eccentric, richy rich! Love to dress up. Love to schmooze with the elf chicks at the LARP events! I do.. all the LARPing! I just... LARP it up!""

""Right, right! Haha. Well that's awesome, man!"" The random dude takes a selfie then leaves.

Doom sits back down with Franklin.

""I just came the closest to suicide I've ever been."" Doom states.

""Wait, really? You want me to revert the Tony thing?"" Franklin asks.

""No! We must press on. It will help Doom gain favor with the Avengers of this Earth..."" Doom says while taking new Tinder selfies.

Back at Dairy Queen, which is now closed and part of a police investigation, everyone has been asked to stay and is being interviewed. While waiting, Sue is secretly on Tinder to pass the time and starts swiping. Reed doesn't notice because he is busy tuning a device that will hack all surveillance footage in the world. The plan is to then have HERBIE run a scan through all of it and search for instances of Franklin's face. The New Avengers are all playing Among Us together. Johnny is crying still over the reporter while Thing consoles him.

The police announce everyone is free to leave. Sue continues to swipe and matches with ""Tony Stark"". She gets a text from him that says ""Drinks tonight?"" and she agrees.

The New Avengers let the Fantastic Four crash at their HQ while they search for Franklin.

It is now night time, and Reed asks HERBIE if he has found anything yet, but HERBIE says it is a lot to get through and he could be anywhere. Sue tells Reed she's getting a bit stressed so she wants to go for a walk. Reed lets her while he stays with HERBIE in case anything comes up.

Sue walks into a fancy restaurant and Tony Stark raises his hand to signal her.

""You look even more beautiful than your pictures, Miss Storm.""

""Ah, well you're very handsome yourself, Mister Stark.""

""Alright, I know I started it but we need to stop with the formalities before it gets too far. Because I wanna do very informal things to you. I wanna tear your clothes off with my teeth. I wanna bury my face in-""

The waitress comes over to interrupt.

""Can I get you started with some drinks?""

""Yes. I'll have some orange juice."" Tony says.

""Umm.... I'll go for a Strawberry Daquiri,  please."" Sue orders.

The waitress takes their menus and walks away.

""You're getting an.. orange juice? I thought someone as ritzy as Tony Stark would want something more... sophisticated..""

""I like orange juice. I like it. So it's my choice.""

""Okay...""

Back at the New Avengers HQ, everyone is asleep but Reed is woken up by HERBIE saying he found a match. Franklin is hanging out in the backlot of the fancy restaurant. Reed triangulates the location and heads there.

Now back at the restaurant. Tony and Sue are reading the food menu now.

""So Sue... listen... I know who you are. You're the invisible woman. So you can go invisible right now and fuck me in the middle of this restaurant and nobody will even know the difference.""

""How do you know me, the New Avengers said they don't have a Fant-""

""But I'm Iron Man... I've been to other realities. And guess what? In every single one of them, you leave Reed for me. So let's just jump to that part. Fuck me right now.""

""Um... okay."" Sue goes to the bathroom, turns invisible in the stall, then we see the door open and close by itself. She starts walking toward Tony while he undoes his belt.

Meanwhile, Reed arrives via taxi at the restaurant and finds Franklin just sitting out back using his reality powers to make constant pizzas to throw at a rat.

""Franklin! My God, I found you buddy! I knew Doom would've followed us here with you! But where is he?""

""Inside. He has a date.""

""What the hell and he just left you out here?""

""He's not a very good person.""

""We're gonna take him out if we have to, okay? I know it's gonna be tough but you can use your powers to just erase him if you really want to right?""

""I'll try. He looks like Tony Stark now by the way.""

""Who?""

""He's like a famous superhero in a lot of other realities. Let's go in, I'll point him out. I'll disguise you too.""

Reed sneaks inside the restaurant with Franklin. They both look like old men now. Franklin points to Doom disguised as Tony.

""What's going on with him, why is he convulsing like that? Is he choking?"" Reed asks.

""Umm... I don't know.""

Reed walks closer and hears faint moaning. But he recognizes the moans.

""SUE!?"" Reed asks in shock.

This throws off her concentration and she becomes visible again. She's naked and riding ""Tony.""

""FRANKLIN CLOSE YOUR EYES!"" REED YELLS.

Franklin runs out of the restaurant in shock.

""Sue! Get off of him! That's Doom! And no matter who it is, how could you do this to me!? To our family!?""

""Listen, Reed, I promise.... I was only using him for sex, okay!? Nothing else!""

""Yeah, that's why I'm mad!""

""Oh, okay!"" Sue responds.

Tony Doom just sits there watching this.

""Richards... you're such a fucking cockblock, dude."" Doom says.

""Oh shut the fuck up, Victor! You were fucking my wife! And don't you feel fucking pathetic that you had to use the powers of my son, who is basically a God, to finally have her be into you? So you had to reshape the fabric of the universe using a God to get what I got by just being a man. That can't feel good. You should feel like a fucking loser.""

""Like.... honestly, Reed, bro... I'm having that post-nut clarity shit goin' on right now so ion even give a shit about your stupid ass and our beef n shit. It's always about how much better and more pure you are.... I'm way too extreme, I'm way too callous, I'm too petty, I'm pathetic, I'm a loser, blah blah blah... but guess what, Reed? I just fucked your bitch. And no matter what you tell yourself, that shit happened. Suck it. Suck. It. Fuck all y'all.""

I’m a 28-year-old guy from Hungary, and I’ll be in Hanoi from August 15 through December 15. I’m truly enchanted by Vietnamese culture—especially the amazing food, the tea traditions and all the hidden gems around the city.

A little about me:

    Food & Tea Fan: I can’t wait to try the best phở, bánh mì and cà phê trứng spots. I also love brewing tea and experimenting with recipes back home.

    City Explorer: From bustling markets and cozy cafés to lakeside strolls and rooftop bars, I’m always up for discovering new favorite hangouts.

    Story Lover: Whether it’s a family recipe, a local legend or your favorite travel tale, I’d love to swap stories over snacks or coffee.

    Easygoing Vibes: Day trips outside Hanoi, sunset walks by Hoàn Kiếm Lake or just chilling in a laid-back bar—whatever feels right!

If you’re in Hanoi and up for showing a curious visitor around your go-to spots (or simply fancy a chat over a delicious bite), please leave a comment or send a DM. Looking forward to meeting you and seeing Hanoi through your eyes! 😊

• Startups and tech  
• Creative industries  
• Or just curious about AI and how it’s changing marketing

Whether you’re an entrepreneur, brand manager, freelancer, investor, or student – I’m more than happy to meet for a coffee, share insights, or help however I can.

Would also love to hear:

* What local business events or meetups are worth attending?

Hey! I just wanted to share a little about how I got here and see if anyone else has taken a similar path.

When my daughter was a baby, I started sewing cute little dribble bibs and selling them locally — mostly just for fun and to stay creative. I never imagined it would evolve into a full-on business. Fast-forward a few years (and many chaotic toddler moments later), I rebranded to reflect what my life had become: hilarious, messy, honest, and totally feral in the best way.

Now I make slow fashion tees, tumblers, and accessories with bold, cheeky slogans — mostly for women and mums who are tired, opinionated, and just want to feel seen. It’s been a weird and wonderful ride figuring it all out — learning heat pressing, building a website, trying to understand social media, and navigating the juggle between parenting and running a business.

Not trying to sell anything here — just genuinely curious:
Has anyone else here built a biz that was completely different from where it started? Or something inspired by your kid/life turning upside down?

Would love to connect or swap stories — or hear if anyone else has made the jump from handmade baby things to “I’m a tired feminist and I need coffee” kind of products 😂",2,1752483366.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

We all carry weight of things we don’t talk about much. Grief, anger, bills… but we carry on. We make our coffee, and do our laundry, and we flush our toilets. We try not to burden our loved ones.

I'm a sceptical atheist and can't bring myself to fully and truly believe, but something in me keeps wanting to practice witchcraft. I have total respect for those who practice and believe in higher powers, but I just can't make myself believe (particularly gods and goddesses - although Lilith keeps close to me, always). 

Maybe I do believe deep inside, and the doubt is internalized from living in a world where people raise their eyebrows at you for even bringing up this subject. 

I absolutely adore the craft and find it exists in all forms of creation, like art, writing, and even cooking. And, the way I see higher powers is very much like how Carl Jung described the 'collective unconscious', and that these do exist in the sense of our collective belief in them. 

I've found my ideal style in Chaos Magick and have been practicing sigil making, and love getting creative with it. So far, I'm getting a lot of ""monkey's paw"" results. I'll get results, but always at a cost - either because there's always a sacrifice, or I'm practicing magick while looking down my nose at it. 

When I attain something, my sceptical brain comes in and explains it away as a coincidence.  I've been having this back-and-forth with my practice consistently since I was a teen, and I'm turning 32 this year. The craft keeps pulling me back into it like it wants me to believe.

I guess what I'm asking is if anyone's had a similar journey into witchcraft, where you are with it now, and how can I silence this nay-saying brain of mine when I truly feel compelled to practice rituals, write spells, stir my coffee clockwise, and see messages in my dreams?

I've seen posts on this forum complaining about being unable to work for longer hours. 10 months ago I faced the exact same issue, and to help whoever has troubles with it, I'll repost what I did to double-quadruple my productivity:

""""""

Dude. I've struggled with the exact same things for years.  
There are clows out there who would tell you you can't work for more than 4 hours a day. Years ago, I did believe them, and that's what I did - 4 hours of work a day (think Deep Work advice). Obviously nothing would get done. I was consistently late on every project and missing everything I wanted to achieve.

You know what I changed?

a) I started **running for 8-15km**, and running (unlike gym!) allows you to focus on your thoughts for some 30min - 1 hour straight

a1) **I've lost 20kg** \- **from 95kg I've went to 75kg** (over 5 mo), which now allows my body to function properly. Being overweight impacts everything, but the worst it impacts your work.

b) **coffee**. I've started drinking coffee as an advice from my postdoc in engineering grandfather. I've went from sitting down and being *unable* \- I had fallouts in memory, I couldn't focus on work (choosing the easy path... e.g. working on low-priority features), consistently being worried about my future **to** making good decisions 90%-99% of the time (coding and life), being unstressed because I know I'm getting shit done, and my memory has improved substantially.

c) **changed my diet**. Won't go into detail, but I was miserable for years because I was eating 800g of rice daily + 800g of meat + a few carrots and sometimes oranges. It's not ""crap food"" but it doesn't give you what you need. I did that for years. I did not get enough *fat, vitamin, fiber*, and all the other stuff. If you have troubles with it: swap all grains to oats, with grains being 20\~25% of your calorie intake; add cheese&butter, add >750g vegetables (I use frozen ones), and set meat at 400-450g/day.

I assembled that diet with a help of a family member who is a dietician with a Masters in chemistry and worked in food industry for their whole life. Highly advised.

d) **I became more technical**. I've learned machine learning on a more advanced level, and suddenly, doing ML research (a company I was starting) became much more realistic.

e) and **cut off all social media**. *I spend on social media maybe 10 minutes a week on average*. I'm only here now because I was looking for a few people to work with on my next project.

""""""

Standard advice, but it has taken me (far) too much mental load to learn all of this.

1lzh3zr,https://i.redd.it/7ou6gyw3xscf1.png,Scorn from My Ex - Wife,"**Chapter 1**

Georgina Wagner, my three-month-pregnant wife, chose to get an abortion just cuz a word from her first love, Derek Reese.

After Derek returned from abroad, he came and challenged me, ""Wanna bet? Let's see how many times Georgina chooses me over you this month.""

Before I knew it, I nodded. Maybe I just wanted to find out how much I really meant to Georgina.

To my disappointment, every time Derek called, she went to him without hesitation.

I was destined to lose from the start.

My surgery was scheduled for the last day of the month.

Years of business dinners had left me with a serious stomach condition.

Just as Georgina and I arrived at the hospital, she decided to leave me behind again after one call from Derek.

""Wallace, something came up at work. It's urgent, and I gotta deal with it personally.

""Let me know when the surgery's done, alright?""

A sharp pain hit me as I watched her rush away. I had to lean against the wall and crouch down.

Was the pain physical or mental? I couldn't tell.

I went to the doctor alone, doing my best to hold myself together.

Eventually, the pain overwhelmed me. I coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed.

When I opened my eyes, the surgery was over.

Lying in bed weakly, I saw Derek push open the door and walk toward me with a smirk.

""Dude, I didn't even know why you had agreed to the bet.

""She left you for me even before your surgery. Seriously, what's the point of holding onto this marriage?

""A word of advice-get a divorce. Gina isn't meant for you.""

Devastated, I smiled bitterly and shook my head.

""Not entirely true.""

He knew what I was thinking.

""You're saying this because Gina's pregnant with your baby, right? You think that proves her love?

""Let's bet again-I can get her to get rid of it.

""You dare?""

I clenched my fists, refusing to believe Georgina would get an abortion just because Derek wanted her to.

Maybe she didn't love me, but it was her baby too!

Derek left, and I leaned against the headboard in silence.

Memories of my past with Georgina came flooding back to me.

Back in our freshman year, I'd fallen in love with her at first sight.

I pursued her relentlessly throughout college, but she never paid any attention to me.

But after graduation, she suddenly agreed to marry me.

Over our five-year marriage, I had been nothing but attentive.

At the company, I was her most capable assistant.

At home, I waited on her hand and foot, and she never had to lift a finger.

I thought that would be more than enough to win her heart.

But since Derek came back, everything had changed.

On my birthday, Derek called her, complaining that he had no appetite because his maid's cooking was awful.

Then she left me without hesitation just to cook for him, like skipping a meal was so big of a deal.

I waited from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., but all I got was a text.

""Wallace, I'm so sorry. I'll throw a big party next time to make it up to you.""

Once, I had another stomach flare-up.

While taking me to the hospital for a check-up, she left me on the roadside despite the pouring rain.

Because Derek said he couldn't find his necklace and wanted her to help.

Things like this had happened way too many times that I had lost count.

All I knew was she left me behind without hesitation every single time.

No matter how much I loved her, I couldn't stay immune to such heartbreak.

And yet... I still wanted to believe her one last time.

Just then, an unknown number called.

I answered, only to find it was from the hospital.

**Chapter 2**

""Mr. Campbell, could you come over? We need a family member's signature for the abortion.""

Abortion?

My blood ran cold at the word.

To my surprise, Georgina indeed went to the hospital as promised.

But she wasn't here to see me.

It was for the abortion.

I struggled with all my might to go upstairs.

The abortion had been done already.

She lay in bed, her face pale.

As I looked at her, my tears blurred my vision instantly.

It had never occurred to me that she could be this ruthless.

It was her baby! How could she do this?

The heart-wrenching pain almost made me lose it.

The physical pain, coupled with the overwhelming shock, left me breathless and dizzy.

I could only crouch down slowly while leaning against the wall to barely stop myself from collapsing.

Just then, someone handed a consent form to me.

Georgina's family member had already signed it.

It wasn't me.

It was Derek, her first love.

I slowly looked up, only to find him smirking at me.

""You must be regretting so much betting with me, right, Wallace?""

He looked at me with a sneer and then shook his head in sympathy.

""You know what? Gina told me more than once that she didn't want the baby at all.

""She found it a burden, an unstable factor affecting her life.

""So, the second I brought the abortion up, she agreed without hesitation.""

His words stabbed my heart like a sharp knife.

I parted my lips but didn't know what to say.

I felt like a clown, facing his barb while not knowing how to retort at all.

He continued with a smirk, ""So...

""The baby might be your bargaining chip to win me, but in Gina's eyes, it was just a liability.

""Wallace, you're nothing compared to me. Wake up-you aren't a match to me at all.

""She'll come running to me eagerly as long as I crook my finger.""

Despite the great pain, I managed to force my stiff body upright.

Then I smiled bitterly and nodded.

""I guess you're right. You're the only one who means the world to her.""

I had no idea how I went home.

After signing the divorce agreement, I came back to the hospital.

In the ward, Derek was feeding Georgina soup.

She was my wife, yet she had never been so gentle when around me.

Somehow, I felt like I was a pathetic intruder.

I walked inside slowly.

At the sight of me, Georgina seemed very surprised.

""Wallace? What are you doing here? I can explain...""

But I wasn't interested.

I waved my hand and said, cutting her off, ""Don't bother. Your explanation means nothing to me.""

Then I took out the divorce agreement and handed it to her.

""Sign this,"" I said.

She looked at me, puzzled, not reaching for it at once.

""Sign this? What is this?""

I smiled sarcastically, ""My baby's gone. Don't I deserve some compensation?""

She was momentarily stunned before taking the divorce agreement, looking displeased.

Without even glancing at it, she signed it and tossed it right back to me.

I looked at her calmly. ""Aren't you gonna take a look at it?""

She shook her head.

""No need. Since you want compensation, you have it.

""I indeed had an abortion without talking to you first. I should make it up to you.""

As my gaze fell upon the divorce papers, my heart broke.

I had thought this baby would be the proof of our love, a continuation of our affection for each other.

Yet, I was wrong. It was merely my wishful thinking.

Derek glanced at me and smiled triumphantly.

I saw the smirk in his eyes clearly.

He was saying to me silently, ""See? She doesn't give a damn about you at all.""

""Get some rest. I'm off,"" I said.

**Chapter 3**

Putting away the divorce agreement, I left the hospital without glancing at her at all.

It'd take a month for the divorce to be finalized.

So, I booked a flight to Balamora in a month.

I packed up some essentials into a suitcase and hid it in the closet.

At night, Georgina suddenly came back.

If it were in the past, I would have prepared a perfect dinner for her and drawn her a bath in advance.

But today, I simply lay in bed and pretended I was already asleep, not bothering to look at her at all.

After washing up simply, she burrowed into my embrace like a naughty kitten, her small hand wandering playfully.

I caught her wrist, instinctively stopping her from touching me.

She looked at me, puzzled.

""What's gotten into you?""

I explained calmly, ""I'm tired. I just wanna go to sleep.""

She seemed even more surprised. ""Seriously? This is when you're most energetic, right?""

Then she realized something.

She looked up at me, observing my expression.

""Are you upset with me?""

I shook my head, saying flatly, ""No. I'm just concerned about your health. After all, you've just had an abortion.""

She smiled and stopped.

Instead, she nodded gently and nestled into my arms, not saying another word.

My heartache was so overwhelming.

As I looked at her, I thought, ""Georgina, is this how you make it up to me?

""How pathetic.

""How ridiculous!

""It turns out you've been using physical intimacy to make you feel less guilty.

""Yet I was foolish enough to believe it was love...""

I tossed and turned that night, not being able to sleep at all.

It was only until the wee hours that I felt a bit sleepy.

In the morning, Georgina made me breakfast, which was something she had never done before.

The black coffee and sandwich on the table stung my eyes.

I had never liked them. They must be Derek's taste.

Georgina looked at me with a smile. ""I've recently learned how to make them. Give it a try, alright?""

Shaking my head, I refused, ""I don't have an appetite.""

Before I could leave, she suddenly stood in front of me.

Then she pinned a lapel pin to my jacket.

""Do you like it?""

I had seen the lapel pin in her study before.

It was a freebie she had received from buying a luxury watch.

Derek had the watch.

In her eyes, he was the one who deserved the best.

She blinked, asking me curiously, ""Wallace, what's the compensation you want? Can you tell me now?""

I said calmly, ""You'll know within a month.""

She failed to pick up on the emotion in my voice.

Smiling, she nodded, and her tone became gentle, which was a rare thing.

""Tomorrow's your birthday. What gift do you want?""

A pang of bitterness enveloped me.

We had been married for years, yet she didn't even know what I liked.

No wonder she had always given me luxury goods as my birthday gifts, such as luxury watches and tailored suits...

Her gifts had always been the same.

It made me feel like she was merely completing a task and couldn't even be bothered to know my preferences.

She looked at me gently upon sensing my silence.

""Wait for me atop Mount Norland tomorrow evening.

""You love the rain, don't you? I've checked the weather forecast. There's gonna be a downpour tomorrow, and I promise I'll be there to watch it with you.""

She thought I liked the rain because my Instagram profile had always been a rain-themed picture.

But she was wrong.

I stopped loving the rain the day she ditched me in the rain for Derek.

She took my hand, saying apologetically, ""I'm sorry for leaving you the last time.

""But, as I said, something had come up at work.

""I had to deal with it personally.

**Chapter 4**

""It won't happen again. I promise-this time, I'll stay with you through the entire rain.""

I had heard similar apologies from Georgina way too many times already.

She'd always say this to me after every time she ditched me for Derek.

In the past, I had thought she'd really change.

I had assumed that, given time, she'd see how much I loved her.

But I was utterly wrong.

My anticipation and trust had always ended up being trampled on harshly.

And now, I was truly fed up with it. I didn't want my feelings to be hurt again.

So, I shook my head and turned her offer down calmly.

""That won't be necessary. And you don't have to do anything for me from now on.""

Being turned down, Georgina seemed surprised. After all, I always did as she said.

She grabbed my hand, seeming genuinely flustered and concerned about me.

""Wallace, what are you talking about?

""What do you mean? I'm your wife. I'm supposed to do things for you.""

My wife?

How sarcastic-I almost wanted to laugh out loud.

She had never cared about my emotions or feelings.

To her, Derek always came first.

As for me?

I was her husband, yet I was always the unwanted one.

She was oblivious to my emotions.

Pointing at the sandwich on the table, she asked, ""You don't want it because it's gone cold, right?

""I'll heat it up for you.""

Before I could say anything, her phone rang abruptly.

Seeing the joy and eagerness on her face, I knew at once it must be Derek.

She stood up hastily, completely forgetting about what she had said to me.

""Wallace, something came up at work. I gotta leave.

""Leave the plates on the table after eating. I'll take care of them when I come back.""

I smiled bitterly as she hurried away.

When did she come back?

Would she ever come back at all?

I dumped the uneaten breakfast into the trash bin.

Then I boxed up all the gifts she had given me over the years.

Now that I was set to leave, I didn't want to leave anything behind.

I'd disappear from her life for good, making sure she'd never see a trace of mine.

I laughed bitterly as I realized all I had were thoughtless luxury goods she had bought for me.

I didn't even have a photo of us together.

Yet, her Instagram was filled with all kinds of photos of her and Derek.

Those who didn't know had said jokingly she was lucky to find such a handsome boyfriend.

She had never clarified, letting them believe so.

It was so typical of her-she was worried that she might say something that hurt Derek.

I was her husband, yet my feelings had never mattered to her.

I drifted through the day in a daze. In the evening, she texted me.

""Don't forget our date. See you in an hour!""

Thunder rumbled-it seemed a downpour was on the way.

I was too worried to let her go up the mountain alone.

So, I hailed a cab and went to Mount Norland.

As I reached the mountain top, what came into my view surprised me.

The area had been meticulously decorated.

A buttery-yellow tent was in the middle with a nightlight inside.

A sign by the tent flap read, ""Happy birthday, Wallace. Welcome back to our little home!""

Our little home that belonged to ... only the two of us?

As I crawled into the beautifully decorated tent and looked around, a flicker of hope lit up.

I thought, ""Is Georgina really guilty?

""After all this time, is she really going to make things right on my birthday?""

I sat in the tent, surrounded by the warm light.

It'd be a lie to say I wasn't touched. In fact, my heart was lit up by hope again. Finally, Georgina showed some concern about me.

**Chapter 5**

Soon, it was our meeting time.

But Georgina was nowhere to be seen.

I took out my phone and saw a message from her.

""I'm sorry, Wallace. I'm stuck in traffic. But don't worry. I'll be there in a second. Wait for me.""

""Alright,"" I replied to her.

Then I set my phone down and gazed outside the tent.

It had started to drizzle.

Surrounded by serenity, I felt much better.

I knew she wouldn't be here tonight.

It had always been like this. Every single time we dated, as long as Derek called her, she'd stand me up.

And she'd always tell me to wait for her, saying she'd be there in no time.

But she never showed up.

Another half an hour passed.

There was still no sign of her.

And then, she texted me again.

""Wallace, I'm so sorry. Something came up at work, and I might have to be a bit late.

""Wait for me. I promise I'll come to you as soon as I'm done. OK?""

""OK,"" I texted her back calmly.

The rain outside the tent grew heavier.

Thunder rumbled, and huge raindrops kept battering the tent.

I had long stopped loving rain.

And I knew Georgina wouldn't be here.

But it was an undeniable fact that the view was stunning.

I picked up my phone and took a photo, which would be the last memento of our relationship.

Just then, I saw an update on Derek's Instagram.

It was a photo in which Georgina had a puppy in her arms, her eyes filled with distress.

The caption was, ""You'll always be here for me whenever I need you.

""I'm so glad you came, even just for my puppy.""

My pupils shrank as I tightened my grip on the phone, my hands trembling uncontrollably.

I knew Georgina never cared about me.

But I'd never imagined that to her, even a dog mattered more than me.

I let out a laugh in despair, my last shred of hope for her vanishing.

The rain kept growing heavier.

Its shrill sound pierced my ears, drowning out my laughter while mocking me for still being alone in another downpour.

After all I'd given over the years, I ended up being ditched time and again.

I should never have expected anything from Georgina.

Because she had never cared about me, not even the slightest. To her, I was no different from a stranger.

I had to let go this time.

The storm outside the tent gradually eased.

Once again, I regained calmness as if the rain had taken my years of obsession away.

Just then, my phone rang.

It was Georgina.

I was so curious-what would she say to me?

After I answered, she apologized to me hastily before I could say anything.

""Wallace, I'm so sorry for keeping you waiting for me for so long.

""I've dealt with work already. I'm on my way. Wait for me there, alright?""

I gazed out at the star-flecked sky, smiling softly.

""No, you don't have to come.""

Though I turned her down, she wasn't upset at all.

Instead, she kept apologizing to me, saying gently, ""Wallace, I'm telling you the truth. I got held up by work. I'm really sorry.

""Don't be mad at me, alright? I'll be right there!

""I'll be there in twenty minutes-no, ten tops.""

It was so typical of her.

What was the point of apologizing? The damage had been done.

She made the same mistake repeatedly. Every time, she'd apologize to me, saying she wouldn't do it again. And then, she'd let me down again. Was she enjoying it?

The rain stopped.

I walked out of the tent, reached out to feel the damp air, and smiled.

""Don't bother.

""The rain ... has stopped,"" I murmured.

Georgina stood me up at Mount Norland, choosing a dog over me.

Back in 2017, I was living in Hong Kong and working for a Japanese fashion company. Although my salary was modest—around USD $2,550—the job was surprisingly stress-free & no OT at all. I could almost complete all my work by 11 AM every day, leaving me the entire day to listen to music, browse online, and hit the gym. I truly enjoyed my time there.

One day during an early summer weekend, I walked past a cozy office building in Wan Chai (a high-class work and residential area in Hong Kong). I noticed a Pacific Coffee shop with an inviting open space and suddenly thought, ""It would be wonderful to work in this building, so I could relax at this café."" I stood in front of the Pacific Coffee shop, imagining myself working on a laptop in that open area.

After having that thought, life returned to normal until, out of the blue, I was fired from my Japanese company job without explanation. A colleague later informed me that someone on my team had spoken ill of me to our boss, leading to my dismissal. Surprisingly, I felt a sense of relief and believed that a better opportunity awaited me, so I didn’t bother confronting my boss. I collected my last paycheck and left.

I took two months off to rest before searching for new jobs on JobsDB. Quickly, I found a position for an online fashion stylist—it was my profession, as I had worked as a stylist during my freelance days in university. Confident in my skills, I applied and, after receiving a call from the company, discovered that the office address WAS THE EXACT SAME BUILDING in Wan Chai I had envisioned on above earlier. I went for the interview and was hired on the spot; my Russian boss loved me and signed the contract immediately.

A week later, I started my new job and immediately felt that the work atmosphere was a perfect fit for me. Initially, I thought it would be similar to my previous job regarding income, but after passing my probation, I realized the commission structure was extraordinary. I could earn anywhere from 40K to 50K USD monthly, with potential earnings reaching up to 100K USD sometimes.

I earned more than I had ever imagined, and although the work was very busy, my colleagues were mostly supportive, with only a few exceptions. Overall, I was very happy there. Time flew by, and before I knew it, six years had passed—from 2018 through the COVID period. Then, the company decided to close the Hong Kong office, and I received a substantial compensation package of almost 130K.

After this experience, I took another break for almost 6 months and applied Neville Goddard's techniques of imagination, leading me to another prestigious luxury company, which I won’t disclose too much in here.

I share this story to illustrate how your imagination can transform desires into reality and how the outcomes can often exceed your original expectations.

So happy manifesting to you all! A rich and fulfilling life awaits you—just trust the journey, and you will know you are truly blessed beyond your imagination.

Thank you soooooooo much!",29,1752482142.0,NevilleGoddard,2,0.98,False

For a few years, I struggled with my dental health due to some really difficult personal circumstances, and unfortunately, my teeth were neglected during that time. But I’ve since turned things around — I’ve been keeping up with my checkups, cleanings, and getting all the necessary treatment done.

So far, I’ve had several fillings completed, and I’m scheduled for two root canals tomorrow (on teeth #30 and #31). After that, my dentist and orthodontist both said I’m good to start braces.

That said, I’m still feeling a bit anxious. I’ve noticed some dark spots on the grooves of my molars and I’m not sure if they’re stains, just natural pits, or possibly cavities. I’ve been told I’m now cavity-free (besides the root canals), but I don’t want to get braces and then have to get work done during or afterwards. I’d love a second opinion, just for peace of mind before starting ortho.

Quick background:
— I don’t smoke or drink alcohol.
— I do drink soda, tea, and coffee regularly.
— I have no medical conditions and take no medications.
— I’ve had all recommended cavities filled.
— I have no pain, no sensitivity, and no gum issues.
— X-rays and photos have been attached.
— Tooth #3 is a metal filling and was done about 10 years ago

My main questions:
	•	Do these spots look like staining or could they still be cavities?
	•	Is it safe to move forward with braces with teeth that look like this?

Thanks so much to anyone willing to take a look and offer some guidance!


TL;DR:
Getting braces soon, had all cavities filled and getting 2 root canals tomorrow. Dentist says I’m cavity-free, but I see dark spots on my teeth—not sure if they’re stains or cavities. Looking for a second opinion.

Everything in this city and country is going to hell. Back in the golden days of [insert imaginary era], you could walk right up to one of the many Biker clubhouses downtown and yell, “Hey you fat dumb fucks, keep it down!” and just like that, it would be even quieter for a couple days. The Angels would ride kick scooters to avoid waking your sunbaked infant, who was peacefully sleeping in a basket on the church lawn.

Eventually, all those biker club houses  were turned into homes for wayward white male teens. That’s where they learned valuable trades, formation riding, and how to use a wrench while smoking Marlboros with dignity.

And the churches! Oh boy. You couldn’t go ten feet without tripping over a Canadian Jesus church Temples? Mosques? Healing circles? Please. We sent all those folks off for a good white Catholic education... showed them proper, we did.

You’d hear nothing but God’s own English and German in the streets. (The nice German men who arrived after the war were so fastidious and pleasant.) My neighbour Helmut used to bring me coffee every Sunday while we chatted about the weather, crop yields, and whether any ""short looking men"" in suits had been sniffing around his property. I’d say, “Helmut, good thing we’re not being overrun by war refugees or immigrants looking for a better life like that dirty slum Toronto, eh?” And we’d laugh and laugh.

Even little Lizzy  Wettlaufer would sometimes give you a handy behind Beckers!

Did you know way back then Bo Beaucage, Pigpen Berry, and Paul Sinopoli used to coach little league down in the park every Monday? True story. And who was the umpire? None other than ol’ Bill Luft himself. What a crew. 

Then it happened. One day, tragically, the first brown person showed up.

Within a week, every butterfly vanished or died on the spot. The churches began to reek of garlic curry, driving away the vampire priests, many of whom were forced to release their altar boys into the wild.

By Friday, thousands of fragile-minded white folks snapped. For the first time in recorded history, they turned to hard drugs and harder living. They grabbed their tents, shuffled to Victoria Park, and swore off showers and taxes forever, never coming home. 

Within the next month, every home had been broken into. The dairies stopped sending milkmen around to fuck your wife while you were off losing a finger or two at Kaufman’s. And all the shops downtown shuttered and bowed before Bezos, trading mom-and-pop pride for Prime delivery. Everything you had was stolen by ""those people"".


Yessir. I sure do miss the good old dayz.

Maybe it's time to drive a dodge ram downtown, block a street, tie a brick to the horn with binder twine and walk back home in time for dinner.

Posting this in the hopes of finding someone I genuinely vibe with. If this still doesn’t work out, I’ll just embrace my fate as the cool Tito who takes his pamangkins on spontaneous adventures. 😂 So please, save me from that destiny!

I’m 31, working in management, 5’10” and around 75kgs (BMI-okay). Looking for something sincere, grounded connection, good energy, and ideally something long-term.

📍 Based in the South (Alabang), and hoping **you’re within 1-2 hrs. drive para meetups won't feel like planning a company outing.**

# Things I’m Into

☕ Cozy coffee shops + slow mornings  
🚗 Spontaneous drives + long conversations  
🌃 City lights and parking-lot coffee  
🎮 PC games for stress relief  
🏕️ Chill outdoor escapes when life gets too loud  
🏃‍♂️ I don’t gym much, but I run 5–10km every other day. That counts, right?

My work schedule shifts weekly, so I’ve learned to value presence over consistency and peace over pressure.

# Faith & Lifestyle

* Open-minded. Respectful of all beliefs. I just avoid anything too controlling.
* I used to live the band life, smoked, partied, the works. But that chapter’s closed. I vape casually, and I’m open to quitting.
* Not a jet-setter (yet), but I’m down to explore, especially with the right person. I just need a heads up, not a plane ticket tomorrow.

# What I’m Looking For

* Biologically Woman - i believe i don't need to emphasize this one :)
* I’m drawn to women who are driven and passionate about what they do, but also **know how to make space for the people who matter**. Yung kayang maglaan ng oras, hindi lang when it’s convenient, but because they genuinely want to connect.
* You’re single (**non-negotiable**) and ideally financially stable or working
* I don’t have strict preferences sa looks. What matters more to me is confidence and how you carry yourself
* I’ll be honest: I’m generally more attracted to **women who aren’t on the chubby side** *(just a personal preference, no offense meant, and I hope that’s okay)*
* **I’m not looking for temporary setups or short chapters.** I value presence, effort, and sincerity. If you’re someone who’s also tired of surface-level talks and quick goodbyes, maybe we can try something a little more real.
* honestly, I think having kids is something that really depends on the woman I'm with. It’s her body, her call and I fully respect that. If she’s into the idea, cool, I’d be all in. If not, that’s totally fine too. At the end of the day, it’s about us being on the same page and happy with whatever life we build together :"">
* And most importantly, I’m looking for someone **emotionally available**. Someone who’s moved on from the past or at least isn’t dragging it into every new connection. Ayoko maging emotional sponge or placeholder habang kinakalaban mo pa ‘yung multo ng ex mo. Let’s both be present and intentional. I’ll meet you halfway, as long as you’re walking toward something real, too.

# The Non-Negotiables

❌ No ghosting. Just say it if you’re not feeling it.  
❌ No emotional tug-of-war with your ex’s shadow  
✅ Consistency over love bombing  
✅ Real effort, real connection

I’m not asking for perfection. Just honesty and shared intent.

If you’re into late-night drives, long convos, quiet coffees, and real connections, let’s give it a shot.

1lzgu7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Home/comments/1lzgu7b/why_smart_home_appliances_are_more_than_just_a/,Why Smart Home Appliances Are More Than Just a Convenience,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to spark a conversation around smart home appliances — not just from a ""cool gadgets"" perspective, but how they're genuinely transforming our homes in practical and sustainable ways.

# What Are Smart Home Appliances?

In short, they’re everyday home devices that connect to your Wi-Fi or other networks and can be controlled remotely, often via smartphone apps, voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri), or automation routines.

Think:

* Smart refrigerators that monitor groceries and suggest recipes
* Washing machines that run during off-peak hours to save electricity
* Smart ovens you can preheat on your way home
* Robotic vacuum cleaners (hello, Roomba) that map your home
* Even smart air conditioners and ceiling fans that adjust based on your preferences

# Why Bother? Are They Worth It?

**1. Energy Efficiency & Cost Savings:**  
Most [smart home appliances](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/smart-home-appliances-market-3775) are designed to use less energy. For instance, smart thermostats like Nest learn your habits and adjust heating/cooling to minimize waste — which can lower utility bills significantly.

**2. Convenience & Automation:**  
Set it and forget it. From running the dishwasher at night to getting alerts when the laundry is done, smart appliances save time. You can even automate tasks based on routines or sensors (e.g., turn on the coffee machine when you wake up).

**3. Remote Monitoring & Control:**  
Ever left home wondering if you turned off the oven? Smart appliances let you check and control devices from anywhere. Some also notify you if there’s a malfunction or maintenance issue.

**4. Integration with Smart Ecosystems:**  
Most devices now play well with Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, etc. Imagine saying: “Hey Google, I’m leaving,” and your house powers down the non-essentials.

# Some Cool Use Cases

* **Smart Fridge:** It detects you’re out of milk and adds it to your shopping list.
* **Smart Dishwasher:** Automatically delays washing to the cheapest energy window.
* **Washer/Dryer:** Sends a ping to your phone when done. No more forgetting and rerunning cycles.
* **Air Purifiers & Humidifiers:** Monitor indoor air quality and adjust settings based on real-time data.

# Downsides?

Yes, there are a few things to watch out for:

* **Privacy & Data Sharing:** Some devices collect usage data, so read the fine print.
* **Wi-Fi Dependency:** No internet = no remote control.
* **Cost:** Higher upfront cost vs. traditional appliances.
* **Compatibility Issues:** Not all brands play nicely together.

# A Few Brand Recommendations

Based on user reviews and personal experience:

* **Smart Thermostats:** Nest, Ecobee
* **Smart Fridges:** Samsung Family Hub
* **Washers/Dryers:** LG ThinQ, Whirlpool Smart
* **Robotic Vacuums:** iRobot Roomba, Roborock
* **Dishwashers:** Bosch Home Connect

Would love to hear from others —

1lzgt1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1lzgt1b/guy_recognized_me_from_one_class_three_years_ago/,guy recognized me from one class three years ago 🤔 possibly interested? AIO?,"this post might be stupid because i think it's unlikely that i'll see him again, or at least not for a long time— but i randomly think about it and i'd love some feedback! (im gonna use weeks bc it helps me keep track lol) 

TLDR at bottom!

around a month and a half ago i'd enrolled in a summer class, where id drive to campus twice a week for class and then stay in the library to study for an upcoming exam. since its summer there werent many students in the lib aside from students in one of our grad programs, and the ones that were there i tended to notice. 

one day after class (five weeks ago) i made eye contact with this pretty cute guy in passing, and idk it seemed like he looked in recognition? but i overthink so i played it off. left my bag and went for coffee. came back a little later and decided i wanted to move, so i went to a diff table, and just then he moved his bag and sat at the table next to mine. again, didnt think much of it. 

eventually he asked if he knew me from somewhere, and we figured out that he was one class with me when i was a freshman (and based on his grad date, he was a junior at the time). i took his word for it because the profs matched up and it was a small class, but i honestly dont remember interacting with him, it wasnt a class where youd talk to others much, and though id say im a talkative person, because of the quiet nature of the class in general i barely ever spoke to anyone. 

he eventually revealed he'd been meaning to ask me where be knew me from because he'd seen me around the pasy few days, which i was confused by because i'd never seen him in the library other days i was there (and was mostly in a private study room anyway). anyways it didn't really seem creepy so we kept talking. because we'd been chatting for a bit and he ended up coming to stand/lean over the side of my desk, i offered him to sit next to me but he kinda brushed it off? (i assumed it was because he'd go back to studying but the whole time we talked he just stood there). 

soon after he left to study, and i only saw him again one week later (so four weeks ago). the convo was like five minutes because he had a class but again, friendly, seemed nice, good eye contact i think? but idk didn't ask for my number or ig or anything. the last week i was there for class (so three weeks ago) i tried to see if he'd show at the library a third time but i had to go so we didn't get to talk after the second time. 

i feel like an idiot explaining ""long and meaningful eye contact"" so im not going to but i was just curious about others' thoughts on this. 

tldr; saw cute guy at lib few weeks ago, came up to me bc he'd noticed me multiple times and allegedly recognized me from *one* class we had three years ago (and never had classes together again). convo flowed, but didnt ask for ig or number, didn't take my offer to sit next to me, but came up on his own a second time the week after to talk while he coudl before class. my summer class ended soon after so i didnt see him after that

also i didnt ask for ig or number or anything bc i dont wanna make a fool of myself and get attached... (context i get attached p quick and exactly a week before our first interaction a dude i'd been ralking to admitted to leading me on LMAO)
