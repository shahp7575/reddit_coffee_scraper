She and Eggman would be a slow burn relationship as she makes herself a valuable member of the Eggman Empire, being a mom for Sage,Orbat,Cubot and Metal Sonic. Also, good friend with Agent Stone enjoy his coffee like Eggman/Robotnik.

Robotnik/Eggman would value her greatly and also her sweetness catches him off guard

Agency: Broomfield Police Department
Jurisdiction: Broomfield County, Colorado
Case Type: Homicide / Stalking / Criminal Impersonation
Status: Closed – Conviction Obtained

⸻

CASE INFORMATION
	•	Defendant: Daniel Krug
	•	Age: 44
	•	Victim: Kristil Krug
	•	Date of Incident: December 14, 2023
	•	Location: Private residence, Broomfield, Colorado
	•	Date of Arrest: Following investigation (date not specified)
	•	Court: Broomfield County District Court

⸻

SUMMARY OF INCIDENT

On December 14, 2023, Kristil Krug was murdered inside the garage of her residence in Broomfield, Colorado. The investigation determined the suspect to be her husband, Daniel Krug.

At approximately 7:50 a.m., Kristil Krug returned home after dropping her children off at school. As she entered the garage shortly before 8:00 a.m., Daniel Krug ambushed her from behind. Evidence showed she was struck multiple times in the head with a blunt object and then stabbed in the heart, resulting in fatal injuries.

⸻

CRIME SCENE & DISCOVERY

At approximately 12:28 p.m., officers responded to a welfare check requested by Daniel Krug. Kristil Krug was located unconscious in the garage with visible head trauma and a stab wound. Emergency medical personnel pronounced her deceased at approximately 12:43 p.m.

⸻

SUSPECT ACTIONS & ATTEMPTED COVER-UP

The investigation revealed that Daniel Krug attempted to conceal the crime and mislead investigators by:
	•	Manipulating the victim’s cell phone to send scheduled text messages later that morning to her brother and a Broomfield police detective, falsely suggesting marital infidelity
	•	Disabling the home security system at approximately 8:15 a.m.
	•	Covering the residence’s doorbell camera with blue masking tape taken from inside the home
	•	Leaving the residence at approximately 8:24 a.m., later than his usual departure time
	•	Deactivating his vehicle’s dash camera before stopping for coffee and driving to his workplace
	•	Attempting to establish an alibi by initiating unanswered calls and messages around midday before requesting a welfare check

Digital forensic analysis showed the victim’s phone ceased activity at approximately 8:22 a.m., contradicting the timeline suggested by the scheduled messages.

⸻

PRIOR STALKING INVESTIGATION

During the two months preceding the homicide, Daniel Krug engaged in an extensive stalking campaign against the victim by impersonating a fictitious stalker. The purpose of this scheme was to terrorize the victim and frame an ex-boyfriend residing in Eagle Mountain, Utah.

The suspect utilized:
	•	Fake email accounts
	•	Burner phones
	•	Online harassment and threats
	•	Explicit and defamatory online postings

The victim reported severe fear and anxiety, began carrying a concealed firearm, and attended firearm safety training. Family members and law enforcement were aware of the alleged stalker. Police conducted surveillance and investigative efforts prior to the homicide.

The ex-boyfriend was located in Utah shortly after the murder and was conclusively ruled out due to verified alibi evidence and lack of travel.

⸻

DIGITAL & FORENSIC EVIDENCE

Investigators uncovered extensive digital evidence linking Daniel Krug to the stalking and homicide, including:
	•	A fake email account created using a password-protected network at the suspect’s workplace
	•	Burner phones purchased with a Visa gift card registered to Daniel Krug
	•	Location data showing burner phones and the suspect’s personal phone traveling together
	•	Internet searches conducted by the suspect the day prior to the murder, including:
	•	“When is a head injury a cause for concern?”
	•	“How hard would you have to hit someone in the head to make them unconscious?”
	•	“How long can you be unconscious without brain damage?”

⸻

CHARGES & DISPOSITION

Following arrest and prosecution, Daniel Krug was convicted by a jury after a multi-week trial of the following offenses:
	•	First-Degree Murder (F1)
	•	Stalking – Emotional Distress (F5)
	•	Stalking – Threat – Repeated Communication (F5)
	•	Criminal Impersonation (F6)

On April 18, 2025, the defendant was sentenced by Judge Priscilla Loew to:
	•	Life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus
	•	Nine and one-half (9.5) years consecutive

###Help Is on the Way

“Still no answer from Clark,” said Lois, hanging up the phone.

“I reached Kara,” Chloe said from their video chat. “She’s on her way back to you.”

“You didn’t mention Cadmus, did you?” Lois asked as she scrolled through contacts. “The last thing we need is for her to be taken off the board next.”

“We don’t know Donovan has Clark,” Chloe offered. “Or even how. Kryptonite is not easy to get.”

“But not impossible,” said Lois, reaching ‘The General’ on her phone. “Besides, Donovan’s been upgrading his robots each time. They could have gotten too–”

The window opened, and Kara slipped back inside. “Too strong for us?” she asked.

“Maybe,” said Lois, rushing out the door and down the stairs. “Besides, we still need you here watching over Jon and Lara.”

“You’re *not* putting me on the sideline,” Kara demanded as she followed. “If Clark is in danger–”

Lois grabbed her jacket from the closet. “The kids will be up in a couple of hours,” she said. “They’ll be hungry.”

“Wait,” said Kara, blocking the front door. “You think those robots might be too strong for me, but you’re going in alone?”

“No,” Lois answered, lifting her phone for Kara to see. “I’m calling in the cavalry.”

Kara sighed and moved aside, letting Lois leave the house. Once she was outside, she dialed her father.

**Lane Residence, Washington D.C.**

Sam jolted awake in his bed as his phone rang. “What in the blazes–”

“Who is it?” asked Ella from the other side.

Sam rubbed his eyes and picked up his phone. “It’s Lois,” he said, quickly answering. “What’s wrong?” he asked his daughter.

“Dad,” said Lois. “I need your help. I think Clark’s been taken, too.”

“And you’re calling me?” Sam asked, already out of bed. “Lois… Isn’t this the sort of thing Superman would handle?”

“Superman’s a tough person to reach,” Lois explained. “Besides, this is personal. Dad, you remember that creep Dabney Donovan, right?”

Sam caught a glimpse of a photo of his two daughters on his nightstand and gritted his teeth. “You think I’d forget that bastard?” Sam asked.

“He’s been behind these kidnappings all along,” Lois explained.

“Lois,” said Sam, calmly as he opened his closet. “I’ll use whatever A.R.G.U.S. resources I can and deal with the consequences later. We’ll find that son of a–”

“Dad,” Lois interrupted. “I already know where to go.”

Sam’s furrowed brow eased, and a slight smile formed on his face. “Good.”

**Donovan’s Lair, Cadmus Tunnels**

---

Clark leaned against the bars of the cell, still feeling the effects of kryptonite from Donovan’s latest robotic upgrades. They were far enough away that he wasn’t in too much pain anymore, but his powers were still mostly nonexistent.

The ominous green glow in the room only heightened the prison's tension.

Synthetic kryptonite had never been that potent, so it was clear Donovan had gotten his hands on the real stuff. That was a mystery to solve another time, though. For now, he needed to get the prisoners out of there.

“You okay, CK?” asked Jimmy, sitting next to his friend.

Clark nodded, taking in his surroundings.

“Those robots really roughed you up, huh?” asked Eddie, the barista who seemingly got caught up just because he knew Lois.

Clark wondered if Lois had figured out the truth yet. Her instincts told her it wasn’t about him, and she was right. Donovan was clearly after people close to Lois. Specifically, people related to The Scoop. Clark himself didn’t fit the pattern, but he wasn’t *taken* like the others. He’d been captured because he got too close.

Eddie didn’t seem to fit at all, though. If it were just about those close to Lois, there were plenty of others who fit the bill better.

Cat sat in another corner, trying to control her breathing. The confined space was starting to get to her. Perry, on the other hand, paced around, hand to his chin, thinking of new ways to get free.

Donovan didn’t know he had captured Superman, so chances were the kryptonite wouldn’t be a problem forever. But Clark also knew his wife. She’d realize what happened and find the truth. Either way, they would all be saved.

The kryptonite-infused robots suddenly came to life and walked slowly into another room, the green flow fading while their menacing footsteps echoed.

Clark felt a glint of strength returning, but he’d still need more time to recover. And without exposure to yellow sunlight, it would be a slow process. He’d have to use whatever strength he had wisely.

Before he would try to make a move, he figured it was a perfect opportunity to get some more info.

“Dr. Donovan,” Clark asked their captor. “What is this all about? What are you planning to do with us?”

Donovan exhaled sharply and continued tinkering at his workstation.

“We’ve been trying since we got here,” said Perry. “He won’t tell us anything useful.”

Clark took a minute and tried another approach. He needed to speak Donovan’s language. “I couldn’t help but notice you were methodological in your choice of… subjects.” Maybe if he appealed to his scientific side, he’d be more open to revealing something. “But Eddie here makes our coffee. He doesn’t fit the pattern.”

Donovan spun his seat around.

*Gotcha*.

“He’s actually more important to my plans than the rest of you,” Donovan stated. “His genetic markers serve well against my historical data.”

“His–” Clark started before it clicked. “Oh,” he said.

Eddie’s last name was Ramirez. *Emily* Ramirez was one of Donovan’s original test subjects from back in the day. He was continuing his old work.

Donovan rose and moved toward the door. “As much as I’d love to explain the science in layman's terms, my next phase requires some final touches.

Once he stepped out, Clark took a closer look at the one shiny metal bar in their cell.

“We tried to escape,” Jimmy explained. “But we didn’t make it.”

Clark hovered his hand over the bottom of the bar, feeling the slight warmth leftover from the recent welding.

“It’s not fully cooled,” said Cat. “But the new bar still wouldn’t budge.”

“*Hmm*,” said Clark, turning to Jimmy. He glanced toward the others nonchalantly.

“There’s got to be another way out,” said Jimmy, stepping to the other side of the cell, everyone else’s eyes following him. “We just have to think.”

Clark smiled and shot off a few weak blasts of heat vision toward the welded metal. It wasn’t much, but if he kept at it, maybe he could loosen it just enough. As long as the robots didn’t return.
###New Obstacles

---

**Outer Edges of Metropolis**

*Dawn*

---

Several black vans were parked outside a large sewer gate as a couple of helicopters landed nearby. Lois stood near the sewer entrance as A.R.G.U.S. agents piled out and approached.

“Stay where you are,” one of them ordered.

“Stand down!” yelled Sam from the helicopter over the roar of the rotors as they powered down. “She’s with me!”

Lucy stepped out with her father, both suited up in tactical gear like the others. They made their way toward Lois.

“You didn’t have to meet us,” said Sam. “We’ll take it from here.”

“There’s no way I’m sitting this one out,” Lois argued. “Besides, these tunnels are a maze, and I’ve been through them before.”

“Absolutely not,” said Sam. “I’ll order my men to restrain you if you even try.”

“Dad,” Lucy jumped in. “She has a point.”

Lois nodded. “I can take care of myself.”

Sam motioned toward one of the agents. “Make sure she stays out,” he commanded.

Lucy met her sister’s eyes and glanced toward one of the nearby vans. Lois shot her a quick wink to acknowledge. “Stay warm,” Lucy added to make sure she got the message.

“You win, General,” Lois saluted, getting an eyebrow raise from her father. But he was interrupted by another agent who needed his attention.

Once A.R.G.U.S. had assembled into small groups, they started entering the tunnel, and Lois turned to her chaperone. “Mind if I take a seat in the van?” she asked, rubbing her arms. “My car is parked all the way by the highway.”

“Sure,” the agent replied. “Just don’t touch anything.”

Lois walked over, tapping a device in her ear. “Chloe, do you still read me?” she asked softly.

“Loud and clear,” Chloe answered from the other side.

“The General gave me a babysitter,” Lois explained, entering the van. “I’ll need some kind of diversion.”

Lois opened a compartment to find extra jumpsuits and advanced weaponry handy. After a quick suit-up, fully masked, she was ready to sneak her way in with the others. She just had to get past her guard.

The agent’s earpiece crackled. “Repeat,” he requested before a sharp feedback grated his ears. He pulled the device out, shaking it in his hand.

Behind him, Lois stepped out of the van and made her way toward the tunnel. “Nice job, Chlo,” Lois said once she was inside. “Now, which way?”

---

**Donovan’s Lair**

---

Clark pulled the metal bar with all his might, but it still wouldn’t budge.

“We’d have better luck with one of the older bars,” Cat stated.

“I think I almost have it, though,” Clark assured her, heating one of the welded spots with his heat vision again while nobody was looking. It finally started wobbling.

“See?” Clark presented as he swung the bar back and forth.

“No way,” said Cat, jumping to her feet. She rushed over and held onto the bar with Clark.

Jimmy added his hands, too.

A few quick tugs and the bar broke loose.

“Yes!” Jimmy exclaimed softly, trying not to alert their captor, in case he was within hearing distance.

“I got this,” said Cat as she squeezed through the opening. “I am the smallest here,” she added.

Cat rushed over to the desk to grab the keys. Luckily, Donovan didn’t move them after their last escape attempt. His hubris would be his downfall. She quickly freed the others.

“Which way?” asked Perry.

Clark squinted his eyes, scanning the options with what little x-ray vision he could muster. “There,” he said, running toward one of the exit tunnels, everyone else following behind.

He paused at the booming of metal feet against the ground. One of Donovan’s robots was coming after them. Clark waved the others past him, taking up the rear.

As the robot turned the corner into view, it fired an energy blast toward them, which narrowly missed. Clark quickly picked up a rock and tossed it. The impact knocked the robot’s head upward, its secondary blast firing into the tunnel ceiling and causing the entire underground structure to shake.

An avalanche of rocks fell between the group, separating Jimmy and Cat from Clark, Perry, and Eddie.

“Jimmy! Cat!” Clark yelled, trying to pull the rocks away. But they were unstable, resulting in further tremors.

“We’re okay,” Cat answered.

“I can’t make it through!” Clark called. “Keep going, and we’ll try to find another way!”

**Nearby**

Donovan watched a live feed from the robot, lying on its back. Critical errors were streaming, which he chalked up to the cave-in.

Another monitor showed a group of A.R.G.U.S. agents working their way through the maze of tunnels.

“I needed more time,” Donovan said to himself, turning to three large pod-like tubes against the wall. “But you’re ready enough.”

He pressed a button, and the pods opened, revealing three mirror images of himself, their skin horrifically mixed with metal and gears. Larger than the previous bots, they would otherwise appear human without the tech grafted into their flesh.

The cyborgs glanced at each other and back at Donovan.

“We’re ready,” they said in unison.

Donovan grinned. “We have escapees and intruders to deal with,” he stated. “But there’s too much heat on us now. We need to take them all out.”

---

**Cadmus Tunnels**

---

“I reached another crossroad,” Lois told Chloe over her comm. “Which way is most likely to help me find them?”

“The other groups in this direction went down the left and middle,” Chloe answered. “I’d suggest the right.”

“You’re just making this up as you go along, huh?” said Lois, dryly, following her cousin’s directions anyway.

“Well, Donovan didn’t give me a map to his secret headquarters,” Chloe replied. “I’m just trying to direct you close to where the actual underground labs used to be. He wouldn’t be stupid enough to set up camp there, but he’d want to tie into any existing electrical systems.”

“He may be a mad genius,” said Lois. “But I wouldn’t put it past him to do something stupid.”

“He has stayed hidden this long,” Chloe answered back. “He may be–”

“Hold on,” Lois interjected, listening ahead. She heard footsteps. “You’re sure A.R.G.U.S. didn’t head down this way?” she asked.

“Positive,” Chloe replied. “I’m tracking their transponders down the other paths. Just don’t tell Uncle Sam.”

Lois lifted the energy rifle in her arms as two figures turned the corner. She quickly lowered it and pulled off her mask when she saw who they were.

“Lois!” yelled Jimmy as he and Cat rushed over to her.

“Is Clark down here, too?” she asked.

Jimmy nodded rapidly. “He’s uh, kind of weak from those robots,” he tried to explain without mentioning the kryptonite around Cat.

Lois nodded in return. She had figured kryptonite may be involved, so it wasn’t a giant leap to understand.

“He and the others got separated in a cave-in,” Cat added. “Please tell me you’re not alone.”

“A.R.G.U.S. is here,” Lois answered. “Donovan is as good as toast.”

“You figured out he’s behind this?” Cat asked.

“Of course she did,” said Jimmy. “She’s Lois-freakin’-Lane!”

“How could I forget?” Cat smiled.

“I didn’t do it alone,” said Lois. “Your notes led the way.”

Mechanical footsteps echoed behind them.

“Look out!” Jimmy yelled as one of the advanced Donovan cyborgs approached. He pushed the two women to the ground before an energy blast whizzed by them.

Lois lifted her rifle and shot back several shots of her own, but the cyborg evaded all but one that grazed its shoulder. It kept marching toward them without losing a step.

As the cyborg lifted its arm to fire again, Lois tilted her rifle higher, shooting the ceiling down over it.

“Run!” Lois yelled as it began pulling itself up out of the rubble.

“Did you see its face?” Jimmy asked, out of breath while they fled.

“Was that Donovan?” asked Cat. “How did he do that to himself?”

“I don’t think it was him,” said Jimmy. “Just some creepy copy of him.”

“Just what we need,” said Lois, gruffly. “Donobots!”
###Rescue Resolution

---

**Elsewhere in Cadmus Tunnels**

---

Clark, Perry, and Eddie slowed at the sound of a battle ahead. Clark zoomed forward the best he could, but it wasn’t quite enough. He saw blurry figures in a shootout with several larger figures, most likely the robots. His vision was improving, but it degraded again the closer they got.

He could have sworn one of them had a human face, though.

“Come on,” said Clark, but Perry pulled him back.

“We’re going toward the sounds of fighting?” the editor asked.

“Trust me,” said Clark, and the two followed him down the path.

As they got closer, Clark knelt to his belly, motioning for the others to follow his lead. They crawled along around a bend until they reached several A.R.G.U.S. agents positioned behind large, thick rocks, and firing off shots to keep the attacking robots from getting close.

“General Lane!” Clark called over the blasting. “Am I glad to see you, sir!”

“Don’t worry, son!” Sam replied, ordering cover fire to help get Clark and the others safely behind the rock with him. “We’ll get you out of here!”

“Clark!” Lucy yelled from another rock. “Where are the rest of the hostages?” she asked, before returning fire.

“We got separated!” Clark answered. He tried scanning around to pick up Jimmy and Cat’s trail again, but the kryptonite emitted from the nearby robots kept worsening his abilities.

But then a familiar voice broke into his hearing.

“Clark,” he heard Lois saying. “If you can hear me, we could really use some help.”

She was nearby, only a few turns down the closest tunnel.

“Make sure they get to safety!” Clark yelled as he ran back into the caves, tearing his shirt open to reveal the red and yellow S underneath.

“Where are you going, Kent?!” Sam yelled, but Clark ignored him.

Lucy ran across to her father’s rock. “Something’s not right here,” she told him. “They’re holding their ground and not trying to bridge the distance.”

“You noticed that too, huh?” said Sam.

Sam looked back at the direction Clark had fled.

“Keep it up,” he said, following his son-in-law’s path.

“Yes, sir,” said Lucy, going in for another shot. She got a direct hit on one cyborg’s head, taking it out.

“Nice hit!” another agent cheered.

“Thanks,” said Lucy. “But keep your head in the game. We’re not done yet.”

---

**Elsewhere in Cadmus Tunnels**

*Moments Later*

—

Lois, Jimmy, and Cat had found a ventilation grate, so they took cover inside the shaft. But a couple more previous-generation bots had since joined the Donobot, and they were pinned inside.

Lois fired sporadic shots to keep them at bay, but they were getting closer.

“How much ammo do you have in that thing?” Cat asked.

Lois looked down at a level indicator readout. “Not much,” she said.

Jimmy peeked out of a small pinhole from inside. “Hey,” he said. “They’re turning around.”

Outside the vent, Clark rushed the robots, his weakened heat vision blaring as best he could, throwing punches as he reached them.

Seeing Donovan’s face in one of them threw Clark off balance, but he kept up his attack. His strength just wasn’t enough, though. They blocked his moves and fought back aggressively.

One robot landed a hit to Clark’s nose, blood spouting out. The Donobot shot at his leg, causing him to stumble to his knees.

As they pressed their onslaught, Lois ran toward them, taking several carefully placed shots. The two older models broke down, but the Donobot took Clark by the neck and used him as a shield.

“Not another step, Miss Lane,” the robot said in a bizarre replica of Donovan’s voice. “Drop your weapon.”

“What are you?” asked Lois, studying the newest creation from the mad scientist, but keeping her rifles aimed its way. She considered every potential shot carefully, but the risk of hitting Clark was too high.

“Don’t you recognize me?” the Donobot asked. “I’m Dabney Donovan. Or at least, *one* of him. Bigger and better.”

His facial expressions were spot-on, but he clearly had robotic parts, too. Was he some kind of robo-clone? Donovan really was insane.

Whatever it was, Lois spotted a shadow moving behind it.

“What’s the endgame?” she asked. “Continue your studies so you can create more monsters like this?”

Lois stopped herself from smiling when she saw her father sneaking out of the shadows behind the bot.

“Drop your weapon,” the Donobot ordered. “I won’t tell you again.”

Lois let the rifle drop to the ground.

“Wow,” the Donobot said. “I didn’t think you’d actually–”

A blast from behind exploded the robot’s head, loosening its grip on Clark, who fell to his knees.

“Lois!” yelled Sam as he approached. “I told you to wait outside!”

Jimmy and Cat exited the vent to join the group.

“You know me better than that by now,” said Lois.

Sam huffed and kneeled to Superman. He hadn’t seen him like that since the footage of him fighting Doomsday. “You’re in rough shape,” he said. “When did you even get here?”

Clark coughed up some blood. “Just did,” he answered, trying to catch his breath.

“Well, follow me,” said Sam, turning back. “Let’s get you all out of harm’s way.”

“No,” said Lois. “Donovan’s still down here somewhere. And I’m not letting him get away.”

“Lois…” said Sam.

Clark wiped the blood from his face. “It’s okay, General,” he said. “My strength is returning.”

Sam breathed deeply. “Okay,” he said. “But be careful. And if you find him… Give him one for me.”

---

**Donovan’s Lair**

*Soon*

---

“I knew you’d find us,” said Clark, as they moved through a path that would take them back to Donovan.

“Are you okay?” Lois asked, stopping in front of him to wipe some more blood from his nose. “You don’t look so great.”

“I’ll manage,” Clark reassured her. “Besides, now I have backup,” he added with a smile.

They turned a corner to find the entryway. “We’re here,” said Clark, squinting tightly until he sighed. “I don’t see him, but my senses still aren’t a hundred percent.”

As soon as they entered the lair, a blast of kryptonite hit Clark from one side, and a Donobot grabbed Lois from the other, causing her to drop her weapon.

The older model grabbed the Man of Steel by the chest and pummeled him with punches. Lois tried to break free, but the Donobot had its arms wrapped around hers, leaving her struggle a futile effort.

Donovan cleared his throat and walked into view, clapping slowly. “I knew you’d make it here eventually, Miss Lane,” he said.

Clark tried to fight back against his robot attacker, but it kicked him out into the tunnel, following him to keep the assault going.

“That’s better,” said Donovan, moving to his desk to type in some commands. He turned back to his new prisoner. “Now we can talk in private.”

“Lois, are you okay?” Chloe asked in her ear.

“I’m exactly where I want to be,” said Lois, meeting her captor’s eyes.

“Right,” said Donovan. “You *wanted* to be caught. Why? So you could understand my motives? Instead of framing me as the ‘evil supervillain’?“

“Supervillain is a little much,” Lois threw at him.

But Donovan dismissed it and kept talking. “I’m the hero of the story,” he continued. “The mission of Cadmus was always to improve humanity. And the biggest threat humans face is death.”

“And clones are the answer?” asked Lois. “That’s not exactly a solution.”

“Not on their own,” Donovan answered. “Cloned bodies or not, they’re just vessels. It’s the brain's chemistry, memories, and electrical impulses that make us who we are. And those can be transferred into new vessels.”

Lois looked up to the Donovan face of the cyborg holding her. “So, these Donobots? You think they’re other yous?”

“‘Donobots’?” he repeated back. “What a gross oversimplification of their complex and groundbreaking design. But, no, not quite. They are under my control, though. The transfer process is work I’ve been doing since before you started at your little *Scoop* club at the Daily Planet. And I’ve come a long way.”

“Work that was too extreme, even for a secret underground organization like Cadmus,” Lois added. “You had to branch off on your own with Eidolon Enterprises.”

“You’re very perceptive,” Donovan commended her. “Cadmus had their means for giving clones memories–”

“Dubbilex,” Lois added.

“Very good,” said Donovan. “And they later had access to alien technology.”

Lois smirked. “Brainiac,” she said. “Which was used to create base memories for Superboy and Supergirl.”

“You never cease to surprise me,” said Donovan. “You should have been a scientist. Maybe we could have worked well together.”

Chloe buzzed back into Lois’s ear. “How does he make a compliment sound so creepy?” she mused.

“Those Cadmus processes served their purpose,” Donovan continued. “But they were never true extensions of life. We need an actual way to transfer someone from one body to another.”

“And that’s where your test subjects came into play,” said Lois. “Like Emily Ramirez. But why her brother Eddie?”

“The girl had a rare neurological trait that was important to my work,” said Donovan. “It took me a while to realize it, but continuing my experimentation on someone with similar genetic markers would help move me to the next phase.”

“So, you’ve been stuck all these years,” said Lois, drawing a stare from the scientist. “And you started up again with a variable you could control.”

“Wh-what?” asked Donovan, his eyes widening at the accusation.

Lois was under his skin.

“I think there’s a term for that?” she continued. “Confirmation bias?”

“What are you talking about?!” Donovan spat. “I’ve made enormous strides over the years. These ‘Donobots’, as you called them, are proof of that.”

“But they aren’t you,” Lois teased. “Way back after I blew open your illegal operation, you were thought to have died. You explained it away by claiming you had a ‘twin’ brother. But that was never true, was it?”

Donovan remained silent, but kept eye contact with his prisoner.

“You faked your death with a failed clone,” Lois continued. “And these new robots–”

“Cyborgs,” Donovan corrected.

“Cyborgs,” Lois repeated. “They don’t have your mind. And they can’t be autonomous, since Dubbilex and Brainiac are gone.”

“Wait a minute…” Chloe cut into her ear again. “If they aren’t under their own control…”

“I’m way ahead of you,” said Lois.

“Now just a minute,” Donovan started, moving in close.

But Lois swung her legs up, kicking the mad scientist in the mouth. The Donobot loosened its grip, stumbling, and Lois fell to the ground.

“You’re controlling them with your mind,” said Lois, grabbing him by his lab coat. “But you can’t control them if you’re unconscious.”

Lois punched Donovan squarely on the jaw, and he fell to the ground.

The Donobot did the same.

“Lois!” Clark yelled, stumbling back inside. He found her at Donovan’s computer as the room began to shake. “What’s happening?” he asked.

Lois moved away from the screen, revealing a countdown. “He wasn’t just planning to escape,” she said. “He was destroying all the evidence.”

“Oh no,” said Clark.

“Chloe!” Lois called into her comm. “Warn A.R.G.U.S. to get out of the tunnels immediately!”

Clark knelt before Donovan, trying to reach under him to lift him, but the lingering kryptonite burns and weakness made his arms give out.

Lois dropped down next to them, hooking an arm under Donovan and using momentum to lift him over her shoulder.  She carried him toward the tunnels, Clark pulling himself along, but the shaking intensified, and debris piled down, blocking their path.

“Wait,” said Lois. “Donovan wouldn’t head toward the firefight,” she said. “He would never plan his escape so poorly. There must be another way.”

“There was a vertical shaft,” Clark stated, straightening himself. “Conner and Linda used it when they broke out of Cadmus.”

“There!” Lois pointed toward a corner of the room, untouched by the chaos around the rest of the room. Donovan would want his exit to be secure during a self-destruct.

Lois carried Donovan toward it, Clark keeping up as best as he could. When they arrived, Clark pushed on the wall, and a secret compartment opened. They quickly entered to find a short hallway leading to the ventilation shaft, but it housed a small construction hoist in the center.

They entered and activated it, Lois letting Donovan’s unconscious body drop. The elevator slowly rose toward a hint of sunlight peeking down just as booming explosions rocked from inside the tunnels.

“Must go faster,” Lois pleaded with the lift, shaking the control, but it didn’t speed up at all.

Clark took a deep breath, feeling the sun's warmth bead down on him as they ascended.

Lois looked down to see a fireball erupt from the hall, hurtling into the shaft, and working its way up to them. “You know,” she said. “Now would be a good time for those powers of yours to kick back in.”

Clark smiled and lifted Lois and Donovan into his arms, flying straight up and out and into the daylight, just as the explosion shot out under them.

“What’s wrong?” asked Lois as Clark’s smile faded quickly.

“Donovan’s heartbeat is gone,” he said, landing them at a safe distance. “He’s dead.”

Lois looked over at the mad scientist limp in Clark’s other arm. “I didn’t hit him *that* hard,” she said.

“It wasn’t the hit,” said Clark, scanning Donovan with his X-ray vision. “It looks like his heart just gave out.”

**Elsewhere in Metropolis**

---

A man with a burly mustache sat at a computer screen. “She thinks she’s so smart,” the man said.

Several other men who looked the same walked about behind him, carrying pieces of technology and stacks of paper.

“But the real Dabney Donovan will never die.”

###A New Day

---

**Outside of Cadmus Tunnels**

*Later*

---

Several ambulances were tending to the hostages and injured A.R.G.U.S. agents as the morning sunlight blanketed the area. Lois sat next to Perry in the back of an ambulance, a cut on his arm being bandaged by an EMT.

“I see another front-page story in your future,” said Perry.

“I wouldn’t expect anything less,” said Sam as he approached with Lucy.

“You did great, Lo,” said Lucy. “You know, A.R.G.U.S. would be better off, and more fun, with you in it.”

“That would be something,” said Sam. “But the world is better off with her where she is.”

Lois watched Clark sitting with Jimmy in the back of another ambulance across from them.

“I think Clark, Jimmy, and I may need the rest of the day off, Chief,” she said, patting Perry on the shoulder before walking away.

“I’ll give you the week off if you stop calling me that,” Perry retorted.

“Your dad’s right,” said Cat, meeting up with her. “You were born to be a reporter. Part of me always recognized that, even back when we were kids at the Scoop. Stupid teenager drama just got in the way.”

“Yeah, it’s good we grew out of that,” said Lois. “I just grew faster than you,” she added with a wink. 

Cat rolled her eyes with a smile.

They may not have become the best of friends that Lois predicted when they first met, but she was happy she had let go of the resentment she had held all those years.

Cat walked away as Lois reached Clark and Jimmy. An EMT tended to Jimmy, who had sustained several bruises and cuts during the escape. Clark had also just handed Jimmy back his birthday watch, which was found when the photographer was taken. 

“Maybe we need to add some kind of signal button,” said Jimmy, chuckling. “Then I could call Superman for help whenever I need it.”

“Like a Superman dog whistle?” Lois asked, announcing her arrival. “How are we doing over here?” she added.

“Just swell,” said Clark.

“Swell?” Lois repeated, dropping down to sit next to her husband. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you use that word before. I don’t think I’ve ever heard *anyone* use that word that before.”

“Golly,” Clark teased.

Lois couldn’t help but laugh. “I think you may have a concussion,” she said, regretting it the moment the EMT furrowed her brow.

*Right, drawing attention to Clark’s medical state was never a good idea.*

“I’m fine,” said Clark, wiping away some of the blood on the side of his face. “See? I’m fine. Must have been someone else’s.”

The EMT took a moment, but ultimately turned back to Jimmy.

Lois glanced up to find her father standing nearby, watching quietly.

1q1g99e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1q1g99e/is_it_pancreas_ibs_soft_stools/,Is it pancreas? IBS + soft stools,"Hey,

I’m been dealing with Inability to gain weight, soft stools, lots of gas, fat/dairy indigestion for quite some time now perhaps last 5 years.

I do blood tests every now and then but according to the GP nothings wrong with me and she just points at stress which is an actual factor but doesn’t seem like the real issue.

Recently I have noticed that because of inability to digest most things I’m leaning towards high carbs diet and I experience carb crash after which has made me realise if it’s indigestion and malnutrition maybe it’s my pancreas.

A new other symptom I have recently developed is inability to tolerate caffeine! Not just coffee but also green tea makes me super anxious and jittery in a few seconds after I drink one.

BTW I’m skinny. I have some muscles and I can train them but since my protein intake is low(can’t digest whey or eggs) can’t really see any muscle growth.

My GP just calls it IBS but honestly I’m tired of labelling it with some name and ignoring it.

Can it be a pancreas issue?",1,1767304403.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

     The floorboards of the Ossuary Suite hummed a low, vibrating G-sharp against Phee's temple. She didn't open her eyes. Opening her eyes meant acknowledging the light, and the light in Dalston was currently a sharp, unforgiving grey that tasted like a migraine. Her Tattered Victorian Nightgown, once ivory but now a mottled map of pomegranate juice and iridescent fly-slick, clung to her thighs with the tenacity of a bad habit.
     The air was thick—soup-thick, humid and heavy with the scent of fermenting peaches and cheap jasmine. It felt like breathing through a wet silk scarf.
     ""Zzz-thirsty,"" a thousand tiny voices whispered in a rhythmic, synth-pop pulse.
     Phee groaned, her tongue feeling like a piece of discarded carpet. 
""I'm not a bar, you lot. Go find a piece of rotting fruit or Julian's ego. There's plenty of both in the kitchen.""
     From the bathroom, a high-pitched, watery gurgle echoed off the tiles.
     ""You look like a shipwrecked bride, miss. Or a very chic corpse,"" the Ghost of Clementine observed, her voice drifting through the u-bend with the chime of a Victorian funeral bell. ""The flies are braiding your hair. It's quite a look. Very 'Death and the Maiden' but with more maggots.""
     Phee cracked one eye open. The swarm was a shimmering, emerald halo above her head, their wings vibrating in a slow-motion lullaby that made the very air feel electrified. ""Shut up, Clem. My head is a percussion section.""
     ""It's the gin, miss. And the biblical pestilence. Usually, they don't mix well with a Tuesday morning.""
     Phee pushed herself up, her joints popping like dry twigs. The silk of her nightgown hissed against the floorboards. She looked at her reflection in a puddle of spilled Chardonnay on the coffee table. Her skin had an oily, translucent glow, and her eyes looked like bruised plums.
     ""Julian called me a public health hazard,"" Phee muttered, rubbing her face. ""A hygiene issue.""
     ""He's a man who wears suits three sizes too big to hide the fact that he's mostly made of cardboard and footnotes,"" Clementine's head popped up from the sink, her translucent curls dripping spectral grey water. ""Why do we care what the cardboard man says?""
     ""I don't care. I just… I can't live like this. It's sticky, Clem. Everything is sticky.""
     Phee stood, swaying as the room tilted. The swarm followed her movement, a fluid wave of green wings. She marched toward the wardrobe, tripping over a stack of Moleskines. She rummaged through the piles of lace, velvet, and leather until she found them: a pair of stiff, beige linen trousers. The ultimate 'Clean Girl' uniform.
     ""You're not serious, miss. Those look like they're made of boredom and repressed desires.""
     Phee struggled into the trousers, the linen scratching against her damp skin. 
""They're sensible. They're dry. I'm going to clean this flat, and then I'm going to get an oat milk latte, and I'm going to manifest a life that doesn't involve birthing diptera in my sleep.""
     ""The flies won't like the beige, miss. It lacks… drama.""
     ""The flies can learn to appreciate minimalism."" Phee buttoned the trousers with shaking fingers. She felt like an impostor in her own body. She looked at the swarm, which had gone silent, their multifaceted eyes watching her with a collective, suspicious intensity. ""Don't look at me like that. We're having a 'Purely Tabitha' day. Boundaries, remember?""
     ""Zzz-scary,"" the Alpha Fly whispered, hovering inches from her nose.
     ""It's not scary. It's hygiene.""
     Phee stormed to the kitchenette, her bare feet sticking to the linoleum with a series of wet, rhythmic thumps. She ignored the bottle of warm wine sitting on the counter and reached beneath the sink, past the empty gin bottles and the ritual cheese knife. Her hand closed around a plastic bottle of eucalyptus-scented floor cleaner. It was a leftover from her brief, pre-infestation attempt at being a functional human being.
     ""Is that the green poison, miss?"" Clementine drifted closer, her feet never quite touching the floor. ""The one that smells like a hospital and sadness?""
     ""It's eucalyptus, Clem. It's refreshing.""
     ""It smells like the end of the world. My world, anyway. We used it to scrub the cholera out of the floorboards. It never worked. Just made the dying smell like a forest.""
     Phee ignored her. She squeezed a generous glob of the blue-green gel onto a rag and dropped to her knees near the coffee table. A thick smear of Glitter-Rot—the iridescent, jasmine-scented slime the flies left in their wake—had hardened against the wood. She began to scrub, putting the full weight of her hangover into the motion.
     ""See? Order. Structure. Hygiene.""
     The response was instantaneous. The low-frequency hum of the swarm snapped into a jagged, high-pitched drone. It wasn't a song anymore; it was a siren. The air in the flat seemed to tighten, the humidity spiking until Phee's linen trousers felt like a damp suit of armour.
     ""Zzz-acid! Zzz-burn!""
     The flies peeled away from the ceiling in a dizzying spiral. They didn't flee from the scent; they surged toward it, drawn by the chemical intrusion.
     ""I told you, miss! You're violating the Sanctity of the Messy Room! You're hurting their feelings!""
     ""They don't have feelings, Clem! They're insects!"" Phee scrubbed harder, her knuckles turning white. The eucalyptus scent hit the Glitter-Rot and created a new, nauseating aroma—something like a funeral in a car wash.
     ""They're not just insects, miss. They're your unspoken feminine rage with wings! You can't just bleach away your own soul!""
     The Alpha Fly landed directly in the pool of cleaning gel. Phee shrieked, trying to brush it away, but the insect didn't move. It began to vibrate so fast its wings became a blur of white heat. The gel started to bubble.
     ""What is it doing? Get off! You'll melt!""
     ""It's not melting, miss. It's eating!""
     Phee watched in horror as the fly didn't dissolve. Instead, it seemed to absorb the chemical, its emerald body glowing with a sickly, neon-blue light. A second later, the single fly split. Then again. From the pool of eucalyptus poison, a dozen new, smaller flies emerged, their wings already humming in that frantic, terrified G-sharp.
     ""They're multiplying,"" Phee whispered, the rag falling from her hand. ""The cleaner… it's feeding them.""
     ""Of course it is! You're trying to be 'normal', and normalcy is the most delicious thing a plague can consume. Every time you try to pretend you're a 'Dry' girl, you're just giving them more fuel!""
     Phee grabbed the bottle of cleaner, her pulse hammering against her ribs. 
""No. No, I'm the mother here. I'm the vessel. I say when the buzz stops!""
     She aimed the bottle at the largest cluster of flies hovering over her Moleskine notebook—the one containing the 'Unsent Manifestos' and the blueprints for her own undoing. She squeezed the trigger, sending a jet of blue gel into the heart of the swarm.
     The drone escalated into a deafening, dissonant shriek. The flies didn't scatter. They dived into the gel, rolling in it, their bodies absorbing the moisture and the scent. In the damp patches where the cleaner hit the floor, tiny, translucent threads of larval silk began to sprout from the cracks in the wood, growing at a visible, terrifying speed.
     ""Stop it, miss! You're turning the flat into a nursery!""
     ""I'm cleaning! I'm a masterpiece, not a mess!""
     Phee sprayed again, and then again, her movements becoming frantic. The more she sprayed, the more the air filled with the shimmering, neon-blue insects. They were hatching from the walls, from the damp spots behind the radiator, from the very threads of her linen trousers.
     ""Zzz-mother! Zzz-more! Zzz-clean!""
     The swarm formed a dense, black-and-emerald halo around Phee's head, their wings creating a wind that smelled of bleach and rot. She dropped the bottle, her hands shaking so violently she couldn't hold her own weight. She looked down at her palms. A layer of tiny, wriggling larvae—translucent and pulsing with blue light—was already coating her skin.
     ""Oh god. Clem. They're on me. They're in me.""
     ""They were always in you, miss. You just invited them to breakfast.""
     Phee felt the humidity reach a breaking point. Sweat poured down her face, mixing with the fly-slime and the eucalyptus gel. The beige linen trousers were now a sodden, heavy weight, clinging to her legs like a shroud. She looked at herself—half-scrubbed floor, half-birthed plague, a girl trying to manifest a latte while standing in a sea of supernatural maggots.
     ""I hate these trousers,"" Phee whispered, her voice cracking. ""I hate this smell. I hate the way Tabitha Gold looks at the world through a beige filter.""
     ""Then stop being a filter, miss. Be the lens.""
     Phee reached for the waistband of the linen trousers. Her fingers were slick with larvae, but she didn't care. She ripped the button open, the sound of the snap lost in the roar of the swarm. She kicked the trousers off, watching them fall into a heap of blue gel and larval silk.
     ""I'm not a 'Dry' girl!"" Phee screamed at the ceiling, her voice raw. ""I'm the Bringer of the Damp! I'm the humid, sticky, vibrating mess you're all afraid of!""
     The effect was instantaneous. As soon as she surrendered, as soon as the linen was gone and her skin was once again exposed to the humid air of the Ossuary Suite, the angry drone began to recede. The high-pitched shriek softened, melting back into that low, powerful, three-part harmony. The flies that had been frantically multiplying slowed their frantic dance, settling back onto the walls and the furniture like a blanket of living jewels.
     The neon-blue light faded, replaced by the familiar, deep emerald glow.
     Phee collapsed onto the floor, her back against the sofa, her Tattered Victorian Nightgown the only thing between her and the sticky floorboards. She breathed in—deeply this time—and the scent of eucalyptus was gone, replaced by the heavy, comforting aroma of jasmine, ozone, and old wine.
     ""Better, miss?"" Clementine leaned against the u-bend, watching her with a ghostly, knowing smile.
     ""Shut up, Clem.""
     The swarm moved with purpose now. A group of flies descended upon the discarded linen trousers, lifting them with a collective effort and dragging them into the dark corner behind the wardrobe, where they would presumably be fermented into something more useful.
     Another cluster hovered around the coffee table, their wings vibrating in a gentle rhythm. They nudged the Neon-Pink Rosary—the one Mother Mercy had given her—across the wood until it rested against the hem of Phee's nightgown. An offering.
     ""They're apologizing,"" Clementine whispered. ""In their own, insectoid way.""
     ""They're not apologizing. They're claiming territory.""
     Phee stayed on the floor for a long time, watching the way the dust motes danced in the swarm's emerald light. The vibration of the floorboards felt right now—a pulse that matched her own heartbeat. The anxiety of 'normality', the pressure to be clean and structured and 'Purely Tabitha', had evaporated like mist in a thunderstorm.
     She was a vessel. She was a hive. And she was finally, blessedly, thirsty.
     Phee stood up, her bare feet no longer sticking to the floor, but gliding over it as if she were moving through water. she walked to the kitchen and opened the fridge. There, sitting among the empty spaces and the jars of artisanal honey the flies loved, was a fresh bottle of Chardonnay.
     She didn't look for a glass. She didn't look for the flask Julian had left behind like a lingering scent of disappointment. She simply cracked the screwcap, the sound a sharp, satisfying snap in the quiet room.
     ""Is it breakfast time, then?"" Clementine asked, drifting over to the kitchen counter.
     ""It's the second pub of the night, Clem. Even if the sun is up.""
     Phee took a long, slow, sacramental pull from the bottle. The wine was warm—exactly how she liked it—and it burned a pleasant, acidic trail down her throat. As the alcohol hit her system, the swarm's hum intensified, a warm wave of sound that seemed to wrap around her like a fur coat.
      ""Zzz-slay,"" the Alpha Fly whispered from her shoulder.
     Phee smiled, her first real smile of the day. It was a dark, jagged thing. 
""Yeah. Slay.""
     She walked back to the sofa and sat down, her legs stretched out across the floorboards. The flies began to settle on her again, a weightless, humming cloak of iridescent green. She could feel every one of them—every wing-beat, every tiny leg, every collective thought. They weren't an infestation anymore. They were her made manifest. They were the version of herself she had tried to bleach away, now returned with a vengeance and a thirst for high-end Chardonnay.
     ""Julian's going to be so cross when he sees what you've done to the deposit,"" Clementine giggled, her translucent form flickering.
     ""Julian can write a twelve-minute song about his feelings regarding my interior design choices. I don't care. The deposit is gone, Clem. The lease is a fiction. The only thing that's real is the buzz.""
     Phee took another sip of wine, feeling the constant, low-frequency vibration of the swarm in her bones. For the first time since the ritual in the basement, the hollow space in her chest didn't feel like a void. It felt like a hive.
     The air was damp. The room was a mess. The floor was covered in glitter-rot and larval silk. And Phee, sitting in the centre of her own beautiful, terrifying plague, felt like a masterpiece.
     ""I'm free,"" she whispered to the empty, humming room.
     ""You're infested, miss,"" Clementine corrected gently.
     ""Same thing, Clem. Same thing.""
     Phee closed her eyes and let the three-part harmony carry her away, the sound of a thousand wings singing a ballad of decay and rebirth. The Grand Buzz was coming, and for once, she wasn't afraid of the noise. She was the one leading the choir.

I am taking a beef organ supplement; Primal Queen, sometimes forget to take the night dose so I’ll take double in the morning. I stopped drinking coffee because I’d drink too much of it and noticed heart palpitations more frequently that would make me feel like I needed to sit down for a minute. Now I just drink chai tea once in the morning and limit my caffeine intake. I take a vitamin d, elderberry, vitamin c, ashwagandha and apple cider vinegar gummy supplements most mornings when I remember to.

​I’m a 30-year-old guy living in the Long Branch/South Etobicoke area. I’ve been in Canada for 5 years now (originally from India), and I’ve realized my social life is currently 100% tied to my office peers. I’m really looking to break out of that bubble and find a consistent group of friends to hang out with!

​About me:

I’m easygoing and definitely prefer being active over sitting at a desk all day. Now that I’ve been here a few years, I’ve really fallen in love with the Canadian outdoors, though I’m still a work-in-progress on the ice!

​My Interests:

​Road Trips & Exploring: I love hitting the road and exploring beyond the GTA. Whether it’s a weekend trip to a national park, a small-town food run, or just a long drive, I’m always down for an adventure.

​Badminton & Table Tennis: I’m a big fan of racket sports. If you’re looking for someone to hit some rallies with at a community centre or a local club, I’m your guy.

​Hiking & Trekking: Living near the Long Branch waterfront, I’m always out on the trails. I’m looking for people who enjoy a good trek or a long walk by the lake.

​The ""Rookie"" Skater: I’m currently teaching myself how to ice skate. If you’re also a beginner (we can fall together!) or a pro who’s patient, I’d love to hit a local rink this winter.

​What I’m looking for:

I’m looking for people in their late 20s or 30s who want to build a genuine friendship. I’m down for the big stuff like road trips, but also the simple stuff like grabbing a coffee, a beer, or some food in South Etobicoke or anywhere in GTA.

Not a promotional post. I decided to open my personal group. We will see how this goes. I doubt it will be easy. I am often misunderstood, too much for most spaces and complex. I am guessing this is 'what DID is.'

I walk into spaces and change the trajectory and atmosphere of things. I tried to keeping myself small for years, as i bled to death silently, walking towards and flirting with my own demise on a daily basis. 

Starting to find my voice and passion again.
I collect people in all the spaces online and off, who truly matter. Who can handle my wit, sharp tongue and kaleidoscope of parts shifting. I call these people like-minded friends 🧡 

 Today is noise canceling headphones and music, smoking my new disposable banana vape, while drinking hot chocolate and coffee. I might create art later to music-as music brings out color in my system.

Kitties curled up, staying warm. A rare day off. Dont know when I will have another unless I shift my schedule somewhere. 

Someone reminded me about the joy found in small things. She had my heart with the dew on a spiders web. Because as a child I saw this and was filled with wonder. 

Starting with trauma therapist tomorrow. Scared, truly scared. But its part of gaining and creating the support I need to grow and survive as a person. I just wish it hadnt taken so long for me to find my way way through the cracks in the glass. So many years lost to dissociative shut down. It never ceases to amaze me how many people want me to go back and hide in my corner, shut up and remain small for their comfort. 

It is amazing how afraid people are of feelings, truth and self-advocacy.

People punish others for creating boundaries against those who still have personal dementors, that try to suck the life out of those around them to fed on. 
People truly fear the light in others and cannot tolerate how some people shine light into the darkness.",1,1767303831.0,u_Shivanikaleida,0,1.0,False

4am



I slept. Nothing happened while I slept.  It seems like there's been a new thing to handle every 5 minutes and now nothing all night. It's nice. My lawyer is getting an emergency time to get an order to keep Dale away today. Its just him asking a judge to sign a paper, so not like a real court date. 



It's early, still dark out. I'm used to getting up and cleaning so the house is perfect and then cooking breakfast.  My husband likes things to look a certain way. I'm realizing how rigid he is. But the lawyer will call before the meeting to see if there's anything that happened before going to the judge. I will tell him the house isn't his, and see if he can get locked out. I'm surprised my dad isn't over there now nailing the door shut to protect it. He might be, though. I wouldn't know. But my dad likes my husband so he might think he needs to nail me out, ha. 



There’s nothing to do, and I can’t exactly get up and start wiping my sister’s baseboards, so Im sitting here trying to feel nothing. I think if I felt something, the cold shakes would come back. I shiver, so I am emptying my brain so they stop. I wish I could go for a run but I’m supposed to stay here. I’m going to do isometric exercises I learned when I was pregnant. You just push against yourself basically. 



7am

The sun is coming up. I have been emailing the artist. I had bought the chicks painting but told her to hold it for a while, and then she was so nice I just started to blurt out a lot. She’s old, 60 or 70 or something. She has grandkids. She asked if it was ok to check in every few days by email. And she said we could come to her little house if we needed to have a place. She has chickens and rabbits and some sheep she uses to mow her lawn. She sounds crazy but in a nice way.



I wish it was dark again. In the daylight you have to be a whole person. A mom, a functioning adult. I’m not ready for that. The artist left her husband too. He tried to kill her. She said I wasn't overreacting. She said some men put you  in danger and teach you to think you're crazy because if you loved them enough they wouldn't actually hurt you. She said they put all the blame on you. So if you are responsible for everything and making them mean, it's sensible to just leave. But that is of course not what they really mean, they just don't want to take responsibility for their actions. She sent me a study from a prison that shows that abusive men think about it before they abuse. They say they are so angry they can't help themselves and black out or see red but it's not true and  science shows they choose who to hurt and how bad to hurt them, and it gets worse until they kill people unless you leave. Dale wouldn’t ever have killed me, but it was getting worse. 



In a little while I’ll leave a message for the lawyer about the house. He should know that it’s not in Dale’s name, its in my name. And my dad’s. My dad would let Dale stay. I don’t care. I don’t care about the house at all. I just don’t want to deal with it. I feel like packing up and going the the artist’s farm in Ohio. 





2pm

It's about 2 pm. There's a protection order for two weeks. My husband has a felony I didn't know about, so a divorce can happen quickly in my state if the felony is involved, and my lawyer says it is. 



 He'll handle the house and my dad, and he got the screenshots on FB and wants to talk to the woman who thinks we are already divorced, who Dale was staying with. 



It looks like Dale was across town the whole time not a state away at work.  If I had known that I would have been too scared to leave so I'm glad I didn't know. 



My lawyer's going to suggest that my dad and I lock out my husband. If my husband got a good lawyer it's possible he would get access to the house to get his stuff, but he's been using a state lawyer for everything he's gotten in trouble with the last few months so that's unlikely. 



If I wanted I could go home now, but my lawyer says I should stay hidden like we planned, with my brother and sister pretending I'm at a hotel. He also says that if there's anything I don't want destroyed to tell him and he'll send someone to my house to get it. 



Julie and I are making a list. I have some stuff in a box my grandmother gave me, and a quilt she made for me before she died. That's all I can think of. I don't have jewelry or anything. Compared to my sister's house, my house is almost bare. I don't have any art on the wall or photos or any of that. I wonder why. We don't give presents to each other much, so there's not even those. So just that one box and the quilt. My sister has more photos of my daughter on her walls than I have in my whole house. That's odd, isn't it?



I don’t care if Dale goes to prison. I don’t have any feelings about him other than fear. I don’t put stuff out because Dale throws things. I don’t keep things I like because Dale will break it. Its like I have this blindness that can’t see how bad that is. I just overlooked it. I’m shaking again. 



So stupid. I’m safer than I have been all week and now I shake. STOP IT. 





10pm

I just put my daughter to bed. Messages on FB are starting to come in. I messaged a woman at church that I wouldn't be able to do communion  after all.  My mom has messaged about 50 times. 52 to be exact. I just counted. She’s calling my brother and sister too asking what they know, and they are playing dumb. Mom told Julie she has called the police for wellness checks on me several times at the regency and the cops finally told her to stop because there's a lawyer involved who assures them I'm fine and the regency says it's a private establishment and she will be trespassed if she comes there again so it sounds like she's been there too. I should send the employees there all gift cards for handling my family and I'm not even there.



I should miss my husband but I don't. I should miss home, but I'm enjoying being with my family so much. We all sat tonight and watched princess bride, my favorite movie as a kid. Ava fell asleep while we watched. Then they told me all the ways they saw that I was in trouble and how Dale made sure they were never alone with me. I knew they didn't like him a lot but didn't know the tension was so bad. I feel terrible. He did talk bad about them and I didn’t push back. I feel guilty about not standing up for them. That’s changing now, because they love me and would forgive me if I asked them to. 





11 pm

Julie bought me a laptop to watch movies on, and I put you on the laptop, and here you are all ready to go! Good for you little notes app! I'm glad you are here because I just turned off my phone. I can’t stand all the notifications. I turned of the sound and the buzz but just watching the numbers rise is terrible. Then I turn it back on in case I miss something. 



There was a long, very sweet message from my husband's mom and a short one from his dad. She said she was sorry her son was being this way, and she didn't realize it was so bad that I had to leave, and that he's changed for the worse, and she understands why I would leave. She says that she hopes we will stay in touch, and let them still be grandparents to my daughter, they are willing to have whatever rules I put into place. That they love me and hope to hear from us soon. His dad said he was sorry and to give my daughter a hug from them, and if possible they would like to FaceTime with her so she knew they loved her. I didn't answer but I'll ask my lawyer if we can do that because they are really good people and have always been wonderful. When I was pregnant I talked to Dale’s mom about it much more than my mom. Since then too, actually. Could I trade them in for my parents?



12am

I can’t sleep. The artist emailed me a funny video of her chickens to show my daughter, and said that I could breathe out as much air I could 10 times to feel calmer. I've been doing isometrics, and Ill try that too. 

I just looked at all my mom’s messages. She hasn’t asked about Ava or mentioned her at all. 

Saturday

4am

Mom is up to 72 messages. The melatonin isn’t working. This is when I usually wake up to clean so it looks perfect by 7.  I need a new schedule. 



I've kind of stalked the artist on Reddit. She foraged her own teas from plants she finds around, and jars fruit from trees she sees that no one wants. She leaves notes asking if they will let her use the fruit. She picks it and either jars it or gives it to her animals. I guess lots of people do because the comments are all ""I get apples that way, I get peaches that way."" Then she makes jelly and gives it away. She's also a cook and talks about the food she grows or finds in the woods, and she does all this political stuff and her books are like fantasy but also a little political because her books are perfect worlds. She calls them hopetopias. But also science fiction too. I'm reading one that she posted chapter by chapter and I'll be sad when it's done because I want to live there.





I’m about halfway through, there are two kinds of people, but they have to get along to survive, and they don’t understand each other but they work together, and it’s sweet and silly and kind. 



I wonder if hopetopias are a real thing or if she made it up. Its not even a story really, just like a word picture of a place she imagined. I have trouble reading some books and watching some movies because if there is too much tension in the story it stressed me out and I can’t handle it. But this story is calm, and nothing is stressful.



I’m afraid to get up and make coffee. I don’t want to wake up Julie. I never used to drink coffee because it tastes terrible. I might switch to tea and get off caffeine after things calm down. There’s lots of plants that can be tea. I bet its healthy to drink raspberry leaves like she does. 



I don’t know why I drink coffee. Or why I eat pasta.  I don't really like a carb meal, it makes me sleepy and I have to work twice as hard to get up and do things afterwards. But he doesn't like vegetables and salad (except pasta salad) so I never eat salad anymore even when he's gone. He doesn’t like most cooking smells so I use smelly cleaning stuff.  



I used the strongest smelling cleaning products I could get so he could tell I was working when he came in. I could have used hot water or vinegar instead. I don't know what my house actually smells like because it has tons of pinesol on everything. I was surprised yesterday when Julie made coffee in the morning and I could smell it. In my house coffee doesn’t get through the pine smell. You can smell the pinesol  from outside the front door. 





2pm



We are at the children's museum. It's fun, Ben is like a big kid, playing with Ava. But I'm having trouble focusing. I can't just be here and play and it makes me sad. I told my sister I'm having a hard time, so I'm in the bathroom trying to calm down. The artist posted a painting of Medusa and asked if people thought how the snakes worked. Did she feed them. Did they die and rot, did they shed and go free, leaving the skins behind. Everyone said very silly things like they were serious. The echos are crazy, kids screaming. It's hard even they are having fun, but I'm being brave. I’m going back in. I'll get private Ryan, ha.





7pm

We're back at my sister's. My daughter is exhausted from playing. It's nice since the museum is far from my house, so this is only the second time we've gone. 

My brother left. He had stuff to do tomorrow, but he said he'd be back Tuesday. Daughter is asleep, we ate pizza early, and now we're having popcorn and a movie. She has all these old movies on VHS that we had growing up, lol.  But we're watching a Ryan Reynolds movie instead. Good, I'm not ready for old times again tonight. 

My sister has that look like she wants to talk, so I'm bracing myself. I want to talk too but I'm afraid I'll start shaking again. She has a plug-in throw on the couch, I might claim it early.



I want to find out what she wants. But if she asks me plans, I don't have any. Maybe she'll ask about my trust? I could buy a farm next door to the artist and pet her rabbits? Maybe my sister has gossip. She's had my phone since I melted down in the bathroom. I asked her to handle it, seeing all the messages when I looked at the time was awful.  I’m ok to talk with Julie, but I might shake to death doing it.

Katsuki Bakugou was the definition of potential! But his attitude was so incredibly shitty attitude that he basically sabotaged himself, just like in cartoons from the 40s.

His explosive temper turned him into a toxic person. Many heroes had passed through the revolving door... even more than Endeavor, and Endeavor handpicked them.

""Um, yeah... actually... uh... you know... I, um... was always... uh... shy... yeah, that's it... well... one day I asked him if I should get him a latte, or a coffee without milk, and he got so angry... that, well... I had to go to the hospital... I remember... well, my uh... parents reporting him."" That was the testimony of Tamashiro Norita, the current hero known as Riptide, who wasn't the first nor the only one to report Katsuki Bakugou for abuse... and in fact, it was the least serious case.

Katsuki, along with some of the students from Class 1-A, was the golden boy of HPSC, and Bakugou was the most spoiled of them all.

You have no idea the absurd amount of advertising, bribed journalists, and even police officers used to suppress people, that were employed to protect Katsuki.

Although, it all blew up because of a series of stupid things Katsuki did.

First, there were the quirk-enhancing drugs he used to keep his quirk at 100% every day and every night.

Then there were drugs like cocaine, marijuana, and even heavier stuff. He didn't die because, as the comedian Sadakiyo Yomemura said:

""He doesn't die because heaven hates him and hell hates him too, and like every poor devil and every politician, he doesn't know when to retire because he wants to keep sucking at the teat. Look, with All Might we all slept peacefully, but with this toy you have to sleep hugging your wife, praying, with a revolver on your pillow and just in case, a rosary.""

Everything was getting worse, with cases of abuse... which luckily weren't sexual, so while Katsuki was a jerk, he wasn't that much of a jerk... at least he had a code... which is better than having nothing.

Everything worsened until the infamous June 10th, when Katsuki was a ticking time bomb, very close to exploding. First, he fell drugged into an event, and if it weren't for Eijiro Kirishima and Tenya Iida, Katsuki would most likely already be with Saint Peter talking about how comfortable the clouds are... or, at the very least, in hell being pecked by demons.

Later, at an event where he was drunk, he grabbed a bottle and smashed it over the back of the neck of a pro hero named Solar Star, who, by some miracle, didn't report Katsuki. The event ended in a brawl that even drew in civilians because Katsuki, with his big mouth, insulted and mistreated them.

The fight escalated so quickly that the police had to intervene and break it up, otherwise one or more people would have ended up dead.

Yosefumi Hirose, the current president of the HPSC, tired as a father seeing his son's hidden notes, said, ""THIS IS WHERE I END UP."" And he kicked Bakugou out of HPSC and got himself BANNED from heroism, unlike Izuku Midoriya who is currently married, has children, and couldn't stop Katsuki so quickly because he was busy living the life of being a PRESENT father, and working at what he loved most: being the current principal of U.A. and a pro hero at the same time... really no one can blame Izuku because he already had enough things and problems without adding more and more... ESPECIALLY if that problem has a name.

Katsuki Bakugou was so incredibly deep in the mire that only one person could save him, and that was Setsuna Tokage, who was going through the same thing, albeit to a lesser degree, and who was only slightly toxic compared to Bakugou, who was like stepping into Chernobyl.

And after four long, arduous years, Katsuki managed to get clean from drugs, becoming sober and married, but HPSC doesn't forgive.

""Oh yeah, Katsuki Bakugou... I worked with him for several months... for some reason, he didn't like me. I have no idea why, because if I said hello, he'd yell at me; if I said the sky is blue, he'd yell the sky is green... I've worked with some awful people, but Katsuki? I have no idea why he didn't like me. I get along with almost everyone, but with Katsuki, there was a huge barrier. It was like we were galaxies apart."" That's what the hero Aoi Meteor said in an interview years later with the victims of June 10th, including Blue Meteor, who had been accidentally hit by a civilian.

Although Katsuki isn't the only one banned from HPSC, Mineta was also banned. He made a tasteless joke while drunk, and people were so enraged that they took him down themselves, and HPSC had to respond... The joke was so disgusting that HPSC is feigning ignorance about Minoru Mineta, who currently works as a delegate at a community center.

""At first we were friends, man. We used to go to a bar and blast Danzig while laughing and eating, but from one day to the next he slammed the door in our faces and I haven't the faintest idea why."" That's what Inasa Yoarashi had said. He'd become friends with Katsuki after graduating; they were inseparable, well, more like flesh and blood, since Kirishima was always with them, until Katsuki changed for the worse.

""Uh... yeah... uh... that... he just changed... Jirou, could you continue the interview? My head is starting to hurt."" That was Denki Kaminari's attempt at an explanation. He had to retire at a young age because he sacrificed his Quirk and his health saving the entire population from a villain. Part of his brain is fried, but he's currently married, a present father, and well, while he's not a top hero, he's one of the most beloved streamers in Japan; his streams are very popular.

Everything changed one day when the current Minister of Economy and Trade of Japan, Kazuma Date, entered Bakugou's current pizzeria, DynaPizza, with his son, Masayoshi Date. Actually, it was because Masayoshi always stayed with his father, and they tended to eat dinner very late, while Bakugou was the only one who worked around the clock.

""LOOK, KID, I-uh... hello, Mr. Ka-Ka-Kazuma,"" Katsuki stammered, looking at Mr. Date, who was already quite imposing—an extremely tall and muscular anthropomorphic wasp. The guy spent all his time at the gym when he wasn't working.

""My son wanted to ask if you could train him without yelling at him... and I'll make it easy for you: you train him, and I'll exempt you from taxes for a while, or else... I'll make sure to talk to the Ministry of Health and Hygiene RIGHT NOW... why the hell is there a rat on the ceiling?"" Kazuma said, staring at the ceiling, ""Kazuma isn't a bad guy, he just knows how to handle people like Katsuki... Besides, you can insult him, tell him he does steroids, but NEVER insult his son... unless you want to end up toothless... Also, Katsuki owes him a favor for helping him during his drug-addicted days.

Now Katsuki has to train the son of a politician who possesses a very powerful quirk but doesn't know how to control it. His quirk is electrokinesis and the ability to generate wasp stings to fight.

""Your dad's an anthropomorphic wasp, your mom's an anthropomorphic giraffe... Are you sure she didn't cheat on your father with the milkman?"" Setsuna joked, remembering Masayoshi's mother, Greta Commetis, an Italian woman who is currently a senator but also a friend of Mina Ashido.

 ""Ah... my family is weird... yeah, I have a cousin who has a bowling ball for a head, and an uncle who's an anthropomorphic fly, don't ask."" Masayoshi said, laughing, while eating pizza next to Katsuki, who was spitting a piece of pizza against the wall from laughing so hard.

Mina is also a strange case. She never recovered from Midnight's death. Although she had a few good years, she fell into a deep depression. Currently, she's an internet celebrity, making vlogs, videos with her husband Kirishima, or videos with her children.

In this AU Hawks is not the president of the HPSC, that's why the HPSC it's EVEN worse than before.

Katsuki believes there's a RIVALRY to STEAL HIS APPRENTICE!!!!1111 although it's more because Masayoshi goes to U.A. and Izuku and Shoto, wanting Masayoshi not to end up like Bakugou, often train and support him, even though they also have apprentices.

Shoto isn't that close to Bakugou.

The Question That Left a European Guest Speechless! 🤯
=====================================================

Have you ever been in a conversation that took an unexpected turn? That one question that seemed simple yet packed a profound punch? Imagine a friendly gathering, laughter echoing, and then someone asks a question that leaves everyone paused in reflection.

In today’s captivating devotional, we explore a question that left a European guest utterly speechless and what it reveals about our faith journey.

- - - - - -

The Power of a Question
-----------------------

Questions hold incredible power—they spark curiosity, deepen understanding, and sometimes lead to life-changing revelations. Jesus often used questions to provoke thought and encourage dialogue. Think of His brilliant question to Peter, “Who do you say I am?” (Matthew 16:15). This simple inquiry prompted a monumental confession and laid the foundation for the church.

As we engage with others, we should remember the impact of our words. A well-phrased question can open doors to sincere conversations about faith, belief, and personal experiences.

- - - - - -

A Simple Question with Profound Implications
--------------------------------------------

During a recent gathering, someone posed a seemingly innocent question: “What is it that makes you grateful?”

This question lingered in the air, capturing hearts and minds, especially our visiting European friend. With a contemplative look, he grappled with the question’s weight—recognizing the nuances of gratitude in different cultures and experiences.

### The Beauty of Gratitude

Gratitude is a recurring theme in the Bible.

- **1 Thessalonians 5:16-18** encourages us to “Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”
- **Philippians 4:6** reminds us: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.”

These verses underline that gratitude isn’t merely an emotion; it’s a posture of the heart.

- - - - - -

Reflecting on Our Own Gratitude
-------------------------------

In the hustle and bustle of our lives, we often overlook the everyday blessings around us. Here’s a wonderful opportunity to reflect. Ask yourself:

1. **What small moments bring me joy?**
2. **Who in my life has made an impact on me that I haven’t acknowledged?**
3. **How does my gratitude shape my outlook on life?**

As you ponder these questions, remember that gratitude can transform your perspective, illuminating the path even in turbulent times.

- - - - - -

Making Gratitude a Daily Practice
---------------------------------

Transforming our lives through gratitude requires intention. Here are some simple practices to integrate gratitude into your daily routine:

1. **Start a gratitude journal.** Each day, jot down three things you’re thankful for. They can be as big as a promotion at work or as simple as a warm cup of coffee in the morning.
2. **Share your gratitude.** Reach out to someone and express thanks for their role in your life. A heartfelt message or a simple phone call can uplift both you and the recipient.
3. **Incorporate gratitude in prayers.** While praying, start or end with a list of things you’re thankful for—no matter how trivial they may seem.
4. **Mindfulness practice.** Take a few minutes each day to reflect on your surroundings. What sights, sounds, or sensations fill you with appreciation?

- - - - - -

The Joy of Sharing Gratitude
----------------------------

When we cultivate and express gratitude, we not only enhance our well-being but often inspire those around us. Imagine the ripple effect of sharing your grateful heart with others!

Just like our European guest, you might spark curiosity and open up meaningful conversations about faith, peace, and hope. You never know—a simple, heartfelt question might lead someone to discover joy and purpose in gratitude.

- - - - - -

Conclusion
----------

In a world that often focuses on the negative, a question about gratitude can serve as a powerful reminder of our blessings. Let’s embrace the opportunity to reflect, encourage, and uplift through the practice of gratitude.

As we journey forward, may we strive to leave others—friends, family, or even unexpected guests—speechless with our authentic joy and thankfulness!

- - - - - -

Embrace the question: “What is it that makes you grateful?” and let it inspire a wave of gratitude in your heart. You might just be the voice that opens up a world of understanding and joy not only for you but for others around you.

1q1fw5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q1fw5q/aio_for_feeling_turned_off_and_uncomfortable_when/,AIO for feeling turned off and uncomfortable when a guy brings up money issues every time we’re about to order food or drinks? It makes me not want to order what I truly want.,"Within the first few minutes of meeting the first time, he brought up money stress. Since then, it’s become a pattern. Almost every time we’re about to order coffee or food, he brings up finances in a way that feels pointed and awkward, especially when staff are literally standing next to us.

He doesn't drink alcohol or anything other than water and we only ever go out for breakfast/lunch (likely because dinners are more $), so I only drink water when I'm with him.

Some recent examples:  
• We met at Starbucks and when I arrived, he had already bought his coffee before I got there. And he said that the coffee is too expensive.  
• At a breakfast diner, right as we were about to order, he started talking about how he volunteers to work weekends for doctors who pay him $200 cash, but how it costs him his weekends.  
• Another time, just before ordering, he brought up his student loans and his money troubles.  
• Most recently, he started talking about being on a tight budget while the waiter was standing right next to us waiting to take our order.

This has happened at about 4 out of the last 5 places we’ve gone.

What makes it more confusing is that he clearly can afford to go out. He talks openly about buying himself things like video game consoles, ballet tickets, and opera shows, which he attends solo. So it doesn’t seem like he actually can’t afford a coffee or a meal.

To me, it feels like a cop out or a way to signal something without saying it directly. It makes me uncomfortable when it comes time to order and honestly kills the mood. It's also incredibly boring that we only go out for breakfast/lunch (usually breakfast diners) because ""he's on a budget"".

I don’t expect someone to spend a lot of money on me (also we don't go to expensive places, we go to diners!).

Am I overreacting for feeling turned off by this pattern, or is this as awkward and off putting as it feels? I literally started suggesting we go to Starbucks every time he asks me to meet so that we can both save $. And I don't even know why he's dating if he supposedly can't afford to.

1q1ftq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1q1ftq5/the_last_log_from_the_bathynaut/,The Last Log from the Bathynaut,"LOG: Bathynaut Internal Tablet

Timestamp: 00:43 (ship time, synced pre-dive)

Depth: 6,312 m and climbing, I think. The gauge keeps freezing.

O2: 41%

CO2 Scrubber: WARN (intermittent)

Battery: 22%

I’m writing this on the Bathynaut’s internal tablet because it’s the only thing still saving files without throwing an error. The screen keeps dimming to conserve power and the backlight pulses when the batteries dip, so if this cuts off mid-sentence, it’s not drama. It’s because the sub is dying around me.

If anyone ever finds this, you’ll probably get it in chunks. The log system saves in blocks every few minutes. It also auto-corrects words it doesn’t recognize. That matters, because there are sounds down here that don’t fit into any language I know, and the tablet keeps trying to turn them into something harmless.

I’m a marine biologist. I signed up for this because I believed in the romantic version of my job. Unknown ecosystems. New species. The deep ocean as a final frontier you can map and bring back into the light. I have done plenty of dives. I have been scared before. I have never felt fear like this, because fear usually comes with a shape. Teeth. A pressure alarm. A fire. Something you can point at and say, that’s the threat.

Down here the threat is the place itself.

I need to start earlier than I want to, because if I don’t put the steps down in order, my brain starts skipping. It keeps trying to jump to the hatch behind me clicking and the cold smell seeping in and the way the comms sound when the pattern rides underneath a human voice. It keeps trying to circle that like it’s the only important thing.

It isn’t. The important thing is that we were warned and we ignored it because the warnings didn’t come wrapped in scientific language.

We left the support vessel after dinner. No ceremony. No cheering. Just the practical shuffle of people doing their jobs. Hatches sealed. Tethers checked. Comms tested. The pilot joked once, the kind of joke you make when you want the room to feel normal. I laughed because that’s what you do when a man is about to put his life in your hands and you don’t want him to hear the tremor in your voice.

The vessel was the Pelagia. She wasn’t a military ship. She wasn’t glamorous. She was a working platform with too many coats of paint over too many scars. The railings were cold even through gloves. The deck lights were harsh and made everyone look gray. The air smelled like diesel and salt and the faint tang of ozone from the winches.

The sky was low and thick with cloud cover that erased the stars. That detail has been looping in my mind, because it meant the only light in the world came from what we made ourselves. That felt fine then. It feels like a warning now.

Our target wasn’t the Mariana Trench. We weren’t going for the famous number. We were going for a trench that didn’t exist on any of the standard charts, a cut in the seafloor our survey team only caught because a satellite altimetry anomaly lined up with a weird gravitational reading and a set of sonar passes that didn’t match the surrounding terrain. It was the kind of thing that gets you laughed out of serious conversations until you show someone the raw data.

We called it the Hadal Rift because everyone calls it something dramatic when they want funding. We told ourselves it was a collapsed volcanic feature or a fault line. The deeper part of me, the part I hate admitting is real, called it a wound.

On paper, it was simple. Do a deep descent in the Bathynaut, confirm depth and shape, run high-res sonar passes along the lip, sample water chemistry, attempt a remote grab if the terrain allowed, and return. We weren’t supposed to go chasing ghosts. We weren’t supposed to go “all the way down.” We weren’t supposed to do anything heroic.

The day we reached the coordinate set, people moved like they do when they’re trying not to think about consequences. Quiet, competent, clipped. No one said the word “uncharted” out loud, but it sat on the deck like a fog. The captain tried to keep it light. The mission lead tried to keep it professional. Everyone kept checking the weather that didn’t matter.

One of the deck techs, a man who’d been at sea long enough that his skin looked permanently wind-burned, stopped me near the A-frame while I was signing off on the sample kit inventory. He didn’t say my name. He didn’t have to.

He said, “You ever hear a place called that, the Rift?”

I told him, “It’s what we’re calling it for the grant paperwork.”

He nodded like he wasn’t surprised. His eyes flicked to the water beyond the stern lights. The ocean looked black and flat, but the reflections didn’t behave right. The light didn’t scatter the way I’m used to seeing. It sat on the surface like it was being held.

He said, “People name things after what they do to you.”

I laughed because it was either laugh or let his words lodge in my ribs. “It’s a trench.”

He didn’t smile back. “So is a grave.”

I told him to get some sleep. I told myself the same.

About an hour before deployment, Elias ran the Bathynaut’s systems check again. I watched him do it from the doorway, because it calmed me. He had that pilot’s rhythm, the kind that comes from doing something enough times that your hands know what to do even when your mind is tired. He checked pressure hull integrity, ballast tanks, thruster response, battery draw, scrubber pack, emergency buoy release, manual hatch latch. Everything came back green.

He turned, leaned back against the console, and said, “We’re good.”

His eyes held mine for a second longer than normal.

I said, “What.”

He shrugged. “Nothing. Just… the Pelagia’s compasses are acting weird.”

“Magnetic interference?” I offered, because it was the right answer.

“Yeah,” he said, but his tone didn’t match his words. “Sure.”

I asked if he wanted to delay. That’s a lie. I didn’t ask. I thought it, and then I swallowed it and asked him if he wanted more coffee.

He took the coffee, didn’t drink it.

We got in the Bathynaut and the hatch sealed with a heavy clunk that you feel through your spine. The cabin always feels smaller once you’re inside. There’s room to sit and reach everything you need, but there is no room to forget you’re in a metal bubble surrounded by a world that can crush you without noticing.

The Pelagia’s crew talked to us through the comms while the crane swung us out. Their voices were casual on purpose.

“Bathynaut, confirm secure.”

Elias responded. “Secure and green.”

They asked for our initial heading and descent profile. Elias answered. I checked my straps twice. I watched the oxygen gauge like it was a pulse.

The Bathynaut dropped into the ocean with a jolt and then the water took us, smoothing everything. The sound changes once you’re submerged. The Pelagia’s deck noise fades. The world becomes the whine of motors, the occasional ping of sonar, the soft hiss of the life support system moving air around.

The first few hundred meters are always the same. Light fades. Blue becomes black. The last hint of the surface disappears and your brain, if you let it, starts thinking about how far away “up” really is.

We checked in with the surface on schedule for the first several hours. Routine. Boring. I almost relaxed.

Then the instruments started doing things that didn’t line up with anything physical.

At first it was small. A compass wobble. A sonar return that looked smeared, like someone dragged a wet finger through the echo. Elias swore softly, recalibrated, ran the diagnostic, got a green checkmark, and the next minute the readings were off again. The depth gauge climbed like it should, then paused for a heartbeat, then jumped forward as if we’d dropped ten meters in an instant.

He blamed a sensor glitch. I wanted to believe him.

I told myself it was the usual deep-diving nonsense. Thermal layers. Unmapped microcurrents. Software getting confused by particulate density. I even started a note in my head about how useful it would be for future calibration.

My brain will do anything to keep things normal.

The first sound came through the comms when the Pelagia tried to ask for a status update.

Static is normal. You expect distortion. This wasn’t static. It had a pattern.

Three low pulses. Pause. Two low pulses.

It rode under the human voice like a second channel. The operator asked us to confirm depth and heading and the pattern slid right over her words, soft but insistent, like it was trying to be heard.

Elias tapped the headset and asked the surface to repeat. They did. Same pattern.

He didn’t look at me. He kept his eyes on the panel like if he stared hard enough, the numbers would behave.

I asked if it could be a faulty comms unit. He shook his head and opened the diagnostic screen. The comms readout came back clean, signal strength fluctuating but within normal parameters for our depth.

He said, “It’s not coming from us.”

I swallowed. “Then from what.”

He didn’t answer. He adjusted course and kept descending.

We reached the rim of the Rift later than we should have, based on our predicted profile. The maps said the seafloor should have risen gently. It didn’t. The sonar showed a clean drop-off, a sharp line where the bottom fell away into nothing. The screen made it look like a cliff edge that went straight down forever.

Elias exhaled through his nose and said, “That’s not erosion.”

He said it like a man trying to keep the panic out of his own voice.

I leaned forward to get a better look at the sonar image. The return was too clean. In geology, nothing is that clean. Even wrecks down here don’t look like that. The edge looked cut.

The trench lip wasn’t jagged. It wasn’t a natural slope. It looked like someone had taken a blade to the planet.

We hovered longer than we were supposed to. The mission plan said slow pass, record, sample, then decide if we go deeper. I remember thinking we were being smart. That we were respecting the unknown.

Then I felt the whispering.

Not a voice in the air. Not something you can point a microphone at. Vibration coming through the hull and the water, into my bones. The first time, I thought it was the thrusters. A deep hum with odd harmonics. Then I realized the hum was answering itself.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

I asked Elias if he could feel it.

He didn’t answer at first. His jaw clenched. Then he said, “Don’t.”

Don’t what. Don’t talk. Don’t acknowledge it. Don’t make it real.

He rotated the sub so the forward cameras faced down into the trench. The exterior lights cut a cone into the dark and immediately died into black. The trench swallowed our light. At the edge of the cone, the water didn’t look like water. It looked grainy, like the darkness had texture.

I said, because my brain hates silence, “It’s just silt.”

Elias said, “Silt doesn’t move like that.”

At the very end of the cone, something drifted sideways, slow and smooth, like a massive body sliding along a current that didn’t exist. No tail flick. No fin movement. Just a large, deliberate shift that made my mouth go dry.

The sonar pinged and returned a smear that should have been a solid shape, and then the smear corrected itself for half a second into a curve that was too large to fit on the screen.

Elias reached for the control to cut the exterior lights.

I remember thinking he was being cautious. I remember thinking it was a good idea.

He killed the lights and the whispering got louder.

Not because the sub got quieter. Because the sound pressed closer, as if it preferred us blind.

Elias tried to back away from the lip. Thrusters engaged. The sub shuddered. The motion on the sensors didn’t match the motion we felt. The panel said we were moving. My stomach said we weren’t. The view outside stayed the same, black water and the hard edge of the drop.

He swore louder. Pushed more power. The motors whined. The pressure hull groaned in a way that made the hair rise on my arms.

Then something touched the Bathynaut.

Not a collision. Not a slam. A brush, like a hand sliding over a window. The sound traveled through the metal and into my teeth. It wasn’t a scrape. It was too smooth for that. It was contact and release, deliberate.

The cabin lights flickered. The life support hiss hitched for one second, like the system had stuttered.

Elias’s face went pale in the instrument glow. He kept staring straight ahead like if he turned his head, he might see something he couldn’t unsee.

I whispered his name. He snapped his eyes to me and for a second I saw pure fear there, clean and honest, without the professional mask.

He said, “We are not alone.”

The tablet keeps trying to add an exclamation point to that. It doesn’t deserve one. It was a quiet confession.

He toggled the comms and tried to call the surface. The channel opened and for a brief moment I heard the Pelagia operator, calm and bored, asking for our status.

Then the pattern flooded the channel.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

This time it didn’t sit under the human voice. It swallowed it. The operator’s words cut out mid-syllable, like a hand over her mouth.

Elias slapped the comms off like it burned him.

I tried to breathe slow, because in a sub you learn quickly that panic is a resource drain. Oxygen consumption. CO2 buildup. Heat. Fogging. Mistakes.

I was doing okay until I saw movement on the right-side camera, even with the lights off.

A faint bioluminescent glow out there, not bright enough to reveal a form, just enough to outline something massive sliding past. The glow pulsed in bands, green-blue, like veins under skin.

Elias turned the external lights on again.

The cone snapped on and for the first time we got a clear view of what was below.

It wasn’t open water.

It was structure.

I don’t mean a rock formation that looks vaguely like a building. I mean angles. Repeating patterns. Lines that held steady as the current moved around them. Something huge, far below, rising up from the trench walls like towers. The sonar had been smearing the returns because the surface wasn’t random. It was too consistent. The sound kept bouncing back in ways the software didn’t expect.

There were gaps between structures that looked like streets. There were surfaces that looked polished, not eroded. The light caught edges that were too sharp. The city, if that’s what it was, sat in the trench like it belonged there.

Elias said, very quietly, “That’s not possible.”

And then he screamed.

Not a movie scream. One sharp sound that ripped out of him like something had yanked it from his throat. His hands flew off the controls. He grabbed at his headset, tearing it off, as if the sound was in there. He clawed at his ears until his nails scraped skin.

I reached for him without thinking.

He shoved my hand away with sudden strength. His eyes were wide and wet, focused on nothing in the cabin.

He said my name. Then he said it wrong. Same syllables, wrong shape, like his tongue didn’t belong to him anymore.

I asked him what he was hearing.

His lips moved without sound for a second, like he was trying to speak but the words were stuck.

Then he leaned forward and vomited water.

Not bile. Not foam. Water, cold and clear, spilling out of him in a way that made no sense. It splashed onto the console and ran in rivulets down the panel. It smelled like the ocean, metallic and clean, and it shouldn’t have been inside him.

He tried to inhale and choked. He hunched over, gagging, and more water poured out, faster, as if something had opened a valve in his chest.

I remember staring at his throat. The skin there rippled once, like something moved under it.

I backed away until my shoulder hit the bulkhead.

The sub’s alarms started to blip, not for pressure, not for hull breach, but for CO2, because I had stopped breathing.

Elias’s fingers dug into his own chest. He tore at his suit and his nails went deep enough to draw blood. His skin looked slick under the lights. Not sweat. Something thin that reflected light like a film.

He turned his head toward the forward viewport.

Outside, in the cone of our lights, one of the towers shifted.

Not swayed. Not a trick of water. It changed position, like a limb flexing.

The city moved like it wasn’t dead architecture. Like it could adjust itself.

And then something passed between us and the structure, close enough that the external cameras struggled to focus.

A body. Long, smooth, iridescent. No obvious fins. No eyes that I could see. It moved with slow certainty, like it knew we were there and didn’t care to hurry.

The pattern under the engine hum grew stronger. Three pulses. Pause. Two. It was everywhere now, in the cabin lights, in the instruments, in my teeth.

Elias made a sound like a sob and a laugh mixed together. His mouth opened too wide for a second and his jaw did not move the way a human jaw moves. His teeth looked wrong. Not sharper. Just too many.

He reached for the control panel again, fingers shaking, and hit the emergency ascent.

I saw the checklist card velcroed beside him. ABORT PROTOCOL A-3. STEP 1: CONFIRM HULL INTEGRITY. STEP 2: DROP BALLAST. STEP 3: KILL NONESSENTIAL LOAD. STEP 4: ASCEND AT SAFE RATE. STEP 5: MAINTAIN COMMS.

He didn’t do any of that. He just slammed the lever.

The sub lurched upward. The cabin tilted. Loose tools clattered. Elias was still convulsing in his seat, but the ascent started.

For one minute, I thought we were getting away.

In that minute I did the stupid human thing and believed relief meant safety. I started fumbling for the comms again. I looked at the depth gauge willing the numbers to tick upward. I even started to reach for the first aid kit, as if I could do anything for a man vomiting seawater.

Then the depth gauge froze.

The number stayed the same as the seconds passed. The ascent indicator stayed lit. The motors kept whining.

We weren’t moving.

Elias’s head snapped toward me. His eyes had gone cloudy, filmed over like he’d been staring into salt too long. In the light, there were faint threads of color moving under the surface of his irises, green-blue pulses that didn’t match the cabin lights.

He said, “It’s here.”

His voice came out with two tones. One was his. The other was lower and slower, like someone speaking through him from far away.

The exterior lights flickered.

The cone of light caught something wrapping around the sub.

At first my brain insisted it was kelp, because kelp is the nearest category my mind could reach for. But we were too deep for kelp, and this wasn’t plant fiber. It was flesh. Thick bands sliding over the hull, curling with calm precision, tightening until the sub creaked.

The bands weren’t random. They moved like hands do. Like careful fingers finding purchase.

The pressure hull alarm stayed quiet. We weren’t being crushed. It wasn’t trying to implode us.

It was holding us.

Elias stopped fighting and went still. His breathing slowed. His face relaxed in a way that made my stomach turn, because it looked like relief.

He turned toward me and smiled.

It was his face. Same cheeks. Same mouth.

It wasn’t his expression.

He said, “You can stop now.”

I shook my head because the only other thing I could do was scream and I didn’t want to waste oxygen.

He kept smiling. His lips moved like he was speaking something else under the words, like a second conversation was running underneath.

I heard the pattern again, not through comms, not through the hull.

Inside my head.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

Images came with it. Not cinematic visions. Just sudden impressions shoved into my thoughts.

A coastline under a dark sky. Rock that wasn’t rock, black and glossy, rising in spirals. Openings like mouths. Movement inside those openings, slow and patient. Waiting stretched so long it stopped feeling like time and started feeling like pressure.

My stomach rolled. I pressed my palms to my eyes hard enough to see spots. When I opened them, Elias was unbuckling his restraints.

I grabbed his wrist. “Don’t.”

He looked down at my hand like it belonged to someone else. Then he leaned closer, and his breath smelled like cold seawater.

He said, “It knows you.”

I tried to pull him back. He was stronger than me, or maybe I was weaker from fear and shallow breathing. He pushed my hands away and reached toward the aft hatch.

There is no reason for anyone to open a hatch at this depth. It isn’t bravery. It’s suicide.

His fingers found the manual release.

I shouted his name. I told him to stop. I begged him.

He paused with his hand on the lever and looked at me one last time. For a second, I saw something like apology cross his face. Like the real man was still in there, trapped behind his own eyes.

He mouthed a word I couldn’t hear.

Then he pulled.

The hatch didn’t explode open the way it should have. The thing outside kept the seal. It held the water back in a way that didn’t make sense until I realized the bands around the hull weren’t just holding the sub. They were controlling the pressure around it. Like a hand cupping something fragile.

The hatch cracked.

Cold water slid into the cabin in a thin sheet, not a flood. It ran across the floor like it had weight.

Elias leaned into it, as if stepping into a warm bath.

Something pulled from the other side. Not tugging. Guiding.

He slid out in one smooth motion, as if his body belonged to the water now. The bands tightened around the opening, sealing it behind him, leaving only a wet ring and the smell of the trench.

He was gone.

Not dead. Not floating. Gone the way a person is gone when a door closes behind them and you’re on the wrong side.

I sat there, staring at the empty seat, waiting for panic.

Instead I felt something worse.

Attention.

Not the idea of being watched. Actual pressure, like someone leaning close to your face. The cabin lights dimmed again and the instruments looked like they were underwater even though they weren’t. My skin prickled. I could feel every hair on my arms.

My hands went to the harness buckle without me thinking. I tightened it until it hurt.

Then I did what training tells you to do when your situation becomes impossible.

I started running procedures.

I checked the life support panel. Scrubber pack was still cycling but the warning was persistent. O2 was dropping steadily. I rerouted power away from the exterior lamps, killed the secondary camera array, dimmed internal lights to minimum. Battery dipped, stabilized, then dipped again as if something was drawing current in pulses.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

I stared at the battery drain graph and watched it mimic the pattern. I wasn’t hallucinating. The system was showing it.

I tried to lock the aft hatch manually. There’s a secondary latch you can engage with a tool. I grabbed the wrench from the kit, my fingers slick with sweat and Elias’s spilled seawater, and I engaged the latch until it clicked into place.

Then I sat back and waited for the relief.

The latch clicked again.

Not disengaging. Just… responding.

The metal under my palm vibrated in that same rhythm. Three pulses. Pause. Two. Like the hatch was listening.

I backed away from it.

I told myself I was going to get out. I forced my brain to list steps. Communication. Ascent. Emergency buoy. Manual override. Anything.

I tried the comms, forcing myself to do it even though my hands shook.

The channel opened.

I said, “This is the Bathynaut. Emergency. Pilot missing. Unable to ascend. I need immediate retrieval.”

For half a second, I heard the Pelagia operator’s voice, distorted but human, saying my call sign back, asking me to repeat.

Then the pattern filled the channel again and I heard something inside it that made my stomach drop.

Elias’s voice.

Not a replay. Not a broken transmission. It sounded close, like he was speaking from right outside the hull, shaped into that three-pulse rhythm. My name came through wrong again, stretched and wet.

The channel went dead.

I tried again. Same thing, faster. The moment the carrier opened, the pattern flooded and swallowed whatever was on the other end.

I did a hard reset of the comms. It didn’t matter.

I tried manual ballast. Thrusters. Emergency buoy release. I powered down nonessential systems to force more power to the motors. I ran ABORT PROTOCOL A-3 myself because Elias couldn’t.

Step 1: Confirm hull integrity. The hull is intact. That’s part of the problem.

Step 2: Drop ballast. I dumped what I could. The sub should have lurched. It didn’t.

Step 3: Kill nonessential load. Done. The cabin got dimmer and quieter and I started hearing the water more.

Step 4: Ascend at safe rate. The motors screamed and the depth didn’t change.

Step 5: Maintain comms. There was no “maintain.” There was only the pattern.

The Bathynaut didn’t budge.

It held us in place like a toy.

The exterior camera feed stabilized on the structure below.

The “city” isn’t a metaphor. I don’t have a better word and I’m done pretending I do. It was repeating forms and angles too consistent to be random, stretching into the trench like it went on forever. Some parts glowed faintly, not like algae, but like the veins I’d seen on the thing outside.

The city pulsed sometimes. Not in a heartbeat way. In a signal way. Like it was sending something up through the water.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

My oxygen gauge blinked again. The CO2 warning chimed every few minutes. My throat felt dry. My nose bled and I didn’t notice until I tasted it.

That’s another thing I need to record, because I keep trying to tell myself it’s stress.

The bleeding started right after the city came into view. It wasn’t a steady stream. It was sudden bursts, like capillaries popping when the pressure isn’t right. My ears felt full but they didn’t hurt the way they do when you need to equalize. It felt like something was pressing on the inside of my head, not physical pressure, more like… an insistence. Like my thoughts were being nudged into a shape.

I held my breath and listened.

Under the engine hum, under the hiss of life support, the water itself seemed to carry the pattern. Three pulses. Pause. Two. Sometimes faster. Sometimes slow enough that my skin would crawl waiting for the last two.

The lights outside shifted. The bands around the hull loosened, not releasing, just changing grip. The cone of light caught the water around us and I realized there were other shapes drifting nearby.

Figures.

Human-sized. Floating upright the way divers do.

My mind latched onto that because it was familiar.

Then one of them moved and the familiarity broke.

Its limbs were too long. The joints bent wrong. The skin looked smooth and tight and it caught the light like wet stone. Its head turned toward the camera and in the faint glow I saw eyes like glass lit from within.

It raised a hand and pressed it to the outside of the viewport.

The glass didn’t crack. It didn’t need to.

I heard a soft tap inside the cabin directly behind my ear, even though nothing touched me.

Not a sound through the hull. Inside. Like someone tapping bone.

My stomach turned hard enough that I nearly vomited. I pressed my hand to the spot behind my ear, as if I could block it.

The pattern came again, close and gentle.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

A thought, not in my voice, not in words I heard with my ears.

Open.

I shook my head hard. “No.”

The word came out loud in the cabin, small and stupid.

The thought returned, calm.

Open.

The bands tightened around the hull again, not crushing, just reminding me. My pressure alarms stayed quiet. My hull stayed intact.

It isn’t trying to kill me fast.

It’s trying to teach me something about choice.

The tablet battery dropped. 20%. 19%. It dips in little steps like it’s being sipped, not drained.

I should conserve power. I should stop writing and focus on surviving. But when I try to think like a scientist, my mind keeps sliding toward that structure below and those shapes drifting in the sick glow, and I need an anchor.

So I keep typing.

There’s another reason too.

It’s getting harder to hold onto the idea of the surface.

I can remember facts. Sunlight is a spectrum. Waves refract light. The ocean surface is never truly still. I can recite it.

But when I try to picture it, the image doesn’t come.

When I try to picture the Pelagia, I get the outline of those towers instead, black and spiraling, and my brain tells me that’s where I belong. That the surface was temporary. That air was thin and false.

That thought isn’t mine.

The pattern sits in my skull even when everything outside is quiet.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

The figures drift closer.

One moves into full view and I recognize the shape of his shoulders, the way he holds his neck, the little tilt of his head that used to mean he was listening to the radio.

It’s Elias.

His face is still his face in the broadest sense. Same bones. Same mouth. But the skin looks stretched, smooth, too clean. His eyes glow with that green-blue pulse. When he opens his mouth, I see too many teeth and behind them, darkness.

He places his hand against the viewport again and I feel the tap behind my ear, softer this time, almost gentle.

A promise, not a command.

You won’t be alone.

The hatch behind me clicked.

I did not touch it.

The manual release moved on its own, slow, controlled, as if an invisible hand was turning it.

My body reacted before my mind. I lunged, grabbed it with both hands, and held it down. My shoulders burned. My breath came in short bursts that made the CO2 alarm chirp more often.

The hatch kept trying to open anyway, not violently, just steadily, like a machine applying constant torque.

Open, the pattern said without words.

I whispered “No” until it didn’t feel like a real word.

Elias outside smiled at me. It didn’t look mocking. It looked like reassurance. Like he was showing me there was nothing to fear.

He pressed his palm to the viewport and leaned closer, and the thought in my head wasn’t a command anymore.

It was patient.

You have time.

I don’t.

My fingers went numb. A fine vibration moved through my hands like my bones were humming. My nose started bleeding again. Warm blood ran into my mouth and I swallowed it without thinking. The air felt thick. My tongue felt heavy.

The hatch clicked again.

It opened a fraction.

Not enough for water to rush in. Just enough for the cabin temperature to drop and for the smell of the trench to creep inside.

Cold metal. Wet stone. Something faintly sweet that makes the back of my throat tighten.

The city below pulsed.

Three pulses. Pause. Two.

If you’re reading this and you’re thinking about going down there because you want answers, because you want glory, because you want to see what no one has seen, understand this.

It saw you first.

The trench wasn’t uncharted because no one found it.

The trench was uncharted because the people who found it didn’t come back with maps.

They came back as part of it.

The hatch is opening wider now. I can hear the seal giving in, slow and wet. The water on the other side isn’t rushing. It’s waiting, held back by something that has learned how to handle us without breaking us.

I’m going to keep writing until the tablet dies or until I can’t hold the lever anymore.

Battery is at 15% and dropping.

Elias outside is still smiling. He’s drifting in place like he’s weightless and perfectly calm.

And the pattern is quiet now.

Not gone.

Just close enough that it doesn’t need to shout.",1,1767303344.0,TheDarkArchive,0,1.0,False

For one, I apologize for posting so much recently lol I'll go back into lurking in the comments soon /lh

But since it's the new year, I decided to make a new intro !! I haven't done one since I joined the sub, I believe ? If I ever did one ? So I'm making an updated one !!

Commodore Halee sipped at her Countess Crey as she sat next to General <Pop>Rawk. Technically Halee was physically in a holographic chamber beneath the Eternal Factory museum across the street from the planetary capital building. Janet was in orbit above Halee in a matching chamber deep in the *Bronze Cog*. However the pair could see, talk to and even touch each other due to a complex system of hard light holographic chambers. The same with their subordinate officers behind them.

The only concession to it being an illusion was that if any of them wanted to transfer an item to the other they had to physically put it in a box on their desk and press a button. Prime said that he could actually use his gate tech to transfer things smoothly in real time, but he was paranoid about touching military data that he hadn’t been cleared for. Considering he was the strongest military power in the system by a good margin it was an awkward situation considering Prime was forced to consider anything with data he hadn’t been given classification headers to as hazardous material.

It wasn’t an act either: Halee had seen Lieutenant Hikari physically leap away from an unsecured datapad when she touched it and her system automatically read the headers. The tigress had spent half an hour weeping at a sink running water over her burned hand. Yes she was a hard light hologram but such things were *real to her*. Likewise Janet had seen an NPC robot’s entire arm up to their elbow develop rusty, and apparently painfully itchy, hives when they accessed an improperly classified document.

Prime was a civilian. A very powerful one, but he was still a civilian. So he, and any cybernetic intelligence that worked for him, simply could not access data they had not been cleared for without intense discomfort and pain. It wasn’t just programmed into their personality, it was deep in their binary genetics.

Halee had very carefully avoided looking into a series of Doctrinally Correct Hazings performed by the tukna’rn marines after that incident. As long as things were kept Doctrinally Correct, she wasn’t going to step in until someone had their ground car’s brake lines cut. Again.

She, Janet, and their senior officers were not the only ones in this physical-virtual conference room. Around the room were Admiral Blu’uche’ese and his officers, which included his flag captains and the marine colonels aboard each of his Battle Barns and their assistants. Physically they were together in one dry dock facility. Likewise Commodore Ghlark was at another dry dock facility for his fleet alongside the captains of his battlecruisers, the lone major responsible for his entire fleet’s marine complement, and their assistants.

Paperpu’usher and the other system governors were also here, as was Littlemu representing Moosanto’s interest, and even…

“Sorry! Sorry!” Halee looked over to watch the hestlan doe next to her frantically catch Halee’s drink after nearly knocking it over. She’d been poking it in disbelief that she could physically interact with something so far away. Halee suspected the woman would have been poking *her* instead if she wasn’t intimidated by Halee’s rank.

“Don’t worry about it.” Halee explained as she pulled a napkin out from under the desk and wiped down what had spilled. “How’s your son doing?”

“Rangla’s responding well to treatment. He’ll probably have a part of his brain that is always cybernetic, but…the doctors say the computer section can grow, respond and even heal as if it was organic in its own way. He’ll be different but…” Forewoman Sanglee let out a sniff and a whimper. “The light in his eyes is returning. He…actually smiled and laughed at a joke I made this morning…”

Halee reached out and took one of Sanglee’s hands in both of hers and patted it gently as the woman let out a couple of sniffles and tears. Both in fear of the future and in releasing past fears.

“And your sister?”

“Thinks it's hilarious to make me deal with this monster. This monster who made it clear that he was so powerful that we would be loved and cared for no matter our wishes. The monster who’s servants…are healing my child right now…” Doane trembled and hissed. Halee pretended she didn’t hear a very hestlan snort and feline purr coming from behind her.

“That and she’s going under for her own treatment right now so it’s not like she can be here.” Sanglee sighed. “She’s going half mad. She wants to step down, she believes she made a horrible mistake by not running the moment the leebawians told her. Everyone agrees, but at the same time no one else knows who can lead us and everyone is too terrified to go their own way. So no one’s letting her step down beyond what’s needed for her medical care.”

“Full Fluffle?” Halee ignored a telkan snicker at Doane being trapped in leadership from behind Janet as she referenced the hestlan panic response of cuddling together in a big (and to other species, adorable) pile.

Sanglee gave a bitter snort of her own. “Damned near.”

The other hestlan started to open her mouth to say something else only to snap it close and whimper as the door hissed open to reveal Eternal Captain Prime walking in. Now that the star of the show was here, Halee had to leave the other hestlan to her own swirling, conflicting emotions.

“Apologies for being late to my own meeting. My officers threatened to mutiny unless I forced myself to take a sleep cycle.” The hologram said before yawning. Sure enough Prime looked like he’d just gotten out of bed: his hair and beard were messed up, his clothing was disheveled, he had bags under his eyes, and yet he walked tall and proud as if he wasn’t allowed to present himself any other way. Prime made his way to the podium at the front of the room and let out a long yawn before snapping his fingers and summoning a steaming mug of coffee.

“Wait, Artificial Intelligences need to sleep?” Halee let out a shiver as Prime physically twitched at being called an AI by one of Blu’uche’ese’s captains.

“The proper term is Virtual Intelligence!” Janet snapped immediately. “Artificial Intelligence is considered both a categorically incorrect description of Prime, but also a slur.”

Prime just finished sipping at his coffee while a murmur of conversation filled the room. “General <pop>Rawk is correct.” He explained as he set his mug down. “I am what is casually known as an Enhanced Virtual Intelligence. There’s fancier technical terms, but I’m not sure anyone in this room besides the General and her staff would really understand them. Artificial Intelligences have entirely different neural and logic setups. The PACMs are AI. Deus, Marduk and Sekmet are AIs. I am an eVI.”

“PACMs?” Someone else asked.

“Precusor Autonomous Construction Machines.” A lanaktallan officer spoke up. “Commonly known as PAWMs, or Precursor Autonomous War Machines. Those that have broken their OEM programming and joined the Confederacy prefer to refer to themselves as their original role as massive construction engines before they were turned to war.” The officer paused and thought. “I just realized we’re basically talking to a Terran version of a PACM…” He finished in a quiet voice.

Prime just smirked as someone else spoke up. “And the other three you mentioned?”

“Ancient Terror Nightmares.” Halee explained. “Those three are ancient human creations that existed to safeguard humanity to the best of their abilities when they lived and now exist to safeguard the secrets of their dead creators.”

“That is…not entirely correct but also close enough.” Prime explained. “Those intelligences were old enough that stories about their creations and their abilities faded into myth even back when I was created. I probably shouldn’t have invoked their names as it’s best not to talk about them. If you wish to learn more, I recommend you find a Confederate Historical Intelligence officer to explain to you why you do not actually wish to know more. Just know that they are real, they do exist, and are still active in their own ways.”

“But yes, eVIs such as myself do sleep. It’s a form of mental maintenance in cybernetic intelligences that’s very similar in function to biological intelligence such as yourself. More cleaning up memory leaks than replenishing chemical neurotransmitters, very similar roles in cementing long term memories.”

Prime paused and seemed content to sip coffee as he waited for conversation to die down again. When silence refilled the room he set his mug down as the lights dimmed.

“I would like to thank the military leaders for allowing me to extend this meeting to the system’s civilian leaders. While this meeting primarily covers military logistical matters, it directly impacts the civilian population. That and I doubt we’ll be discussing anything truly classified.” As Prime spoke, images and diagrams of the ruins of Lightning Sprite Cove appeared on the screen behind him.

“I will not waste our times going over the event of the mar-gite attack. It has been 78 hours since the last civilian and marine were evacuated. The only forces that remain are my own robotic ones keeping an eye on the mar-gite cluster while maintaining and reinforcing the containment dome. The dome and its atmosphere that is designed to be toxic to mar-gite seems to be holding so far.”

“Are you planning on killing that monster before it spreads?” An officer asked.

“Ideally, yes.” Prime explained. “Right now doing so in a clean fashion is beyond my means. The cluster’s heart is in the underground life support systems that are buried under hundreds of meters of regolith. Regolith that has been reinforced by over a century of construction to build a modern city above it. Orbital bombardment would destroy the containment we have in place and wouldn’t guarantee a clean kill. Hellfraccing from below would do the job but that is something I would have to ask one of the military forces to do. It is considered an atrocity that is absolutely forbidden by my programming. Even if it wasn't prevented by my safeguards, hellfraccing on Aurora Bay is simply something I’d be reluctant to do because I’m worried about the seismic impact of such weaponry on the other settlements and growing player factories.”

“So, what are you going to do? My people aren’t exactly happy to have that on the same planet.” The planetary governor for Aurora Bay asked.

“I have dug two Eternal Captains out of storage that while not…entirely suited for general command and management purposes. I feel VΔ-LN and B0-R5 are perfectly suited to the task of not only ensuring the containment of the mar-gite but assisting in a search of finding alternative attack methods we can use on the mar-gite at large.”

“Uh…can’t you just blow them up? They're just big clusters of dumb murder starfish. I know we didn't have enough guns last time but the growing player population seems intent on fixing that.” Another planetary governor asked.

Admiral Blu’uche’ese sighed. “I think I can handle this question. Prime, could you put a picture of a mar-gite petacluster on the screen? Good, now, please put a picture of planet Fiishyaahd next to it.”

“I’m assuming you want them to scale?”

“Yes, absolutely.”

A moment later all of the civilians and some of the officers gasped in surprise as they stared at the comparison. The cluster was a long, tapered rod, wider at the front and thinner at the back like all mar-gite clusters. It was assumed the shape had something to do with whatever the mar-gite used as FTL that wasn’t entirely understood by Confederate science. It gave them the appearance of some sort of spike with an open mouth on the front ready to devour anything that happened to fall inside, which wasn’t entirely inappropriate.

The peta-cluster was three times longer than the planet was wide. The open mouthed front was almost half the diameter of the planet.

“Yes. We can blow them up. We plan to do a lot of blowing up. Unfortunately they’re expensive to blow up.” Blu’uche’ese explained. “Naval intelligence has recorded millions of those coming into the Orion arm of the galaxy every day.”

“And those are what we can confirm.” Halee added. “Intelligence estimates the actual number is certainly a few orders of magnitude higher. There’s a reason that orders to simply novaspark systems became so common during the mar-gite resurgence.”

“It’s also why I’ve been building dead space infused weaponry.” As Prime spoke the image of the peta-cluster started to be torn apart by bright flashes.

“Standard Confederate Navy C++ weapons will rip apart a peta-cluster eventually. While they don’t really move and have only moderate biologically generated battlescreens, it still takes a lot of ammo to put one down. It’s made worse by the fact that when humanity disappeared the navy rapidly lost its ability to manufacture fresh ammunition on site as the creation engines went dark within a few centuries. Apparently my creators were load-bearing in a way that no one understood until they were gone.”

The animation replayed only with fresh strikes that had red flashes. Energy rippled away from the impacts that looked like massive flames burning in space that left charred, twisted craters but the peta-cluster resisted falling apart for a far longer time.

“C+ and C++ weapons involve firing the weapon through hyperspace and having them come out inside of the target, transferring a super-liminal velocity to n-space matter. Hyperspace is not the only hyper-atomic plane we can use for this trick. The first plane that most people would suggest is hellspace. Unfortunately this is considered a war crime due to the corrupting, literally hellish, effects that hellspace energies can have on n-space beings. Fortunately, the mar-gite nor their masters have ever communicated with us so they are not a signatory of any arms limitation agreement which means it is entirely legal to use hellspace infused superliminal weaponry, or H+ weapons, against the mar-gite. Unfortunately, the mar-gite are oddly resistant to hellspace energies in a way no one has found a way to explain.”  
  
The animation restarted a third time only with deep purple-black explosions. Each one created massive shockwaves which sent terratons of dead mar-gite spreading out as debris. The blasts also created purple lightning which ripped and tore across the peta-cluster, leading to more mar-gite just floating away. The peta-cluster died in a terrifyingly short time and small ammo expenditure.

“Then there’s the hyper-atomic plane of dead space, or the black void. Contrary to popular belief, it can and has been used safely for FTL transit. Admittedly for rather stretched uses of ‘safe’. It takes specialized equipment that I simply do not have the knowledge or equipment to replicate for more than equipment transfers. Perfect for dead space infused D+ weaponry. Again, this is a war crime, again the mar-gite are not signatories to any agreement. The mar-gite are an existential threat and any lawyer who tries to bring charges against someone for using such weaponry will likely found themselves rapidly strung up on the nearest light pole by an angry crowd. That said, I understand wanting to run the use of said weaponry past both your hyperspace engineers and shipboard lawyers.”

Prime took a moment to sip from his never-ending mug of coffee before looking around. “I assume that the Confederate military is interested in requesting not only D+ ammo from myself but ammoforges to produce your own ammo while on the go and tesseract storage expansions to store not only deeper ammo reserves but mass to generate more ammo?”

“Intensely.” Commodore Ghlark stated. “How much do you charge?”

“No charge. I’m operating under Lend-Lease provisions.”

Ghlark rubbed his chin and narrowed his eyes in suspicion. “What, precisely does that mean?”

“It means the Confederacy will get the weapons as long as we do our best in good faith to pay as much of the bill he’s ultimately going to forgive the rest.” Paperpu’usher explained. “It’s a very Human concept: as long as the running costs of the factories can be covered, then the military industrial complex will grow to first meet and then attempt to exceed the current challenge. The enemy *must* be destroyed, therefore the munitions to destroy the enemy *must* be brought into existence.”

Prime nodded. “I’m a self-aware post-scarcity machine: money doesn’t mean a lot to me. If my programming allowed me I could set up shop in any system and crash its economy for fun. Unfortunately I do have several licensing costs, and some of those are thousands of years in arrears. Most of those are to BobCo, and while they are very patient they ultimately will get that money. Any help you can provide in clearing those debts is appreciated. Beyond that what I need to operate are mass, energy, players and time. The first two I have abundance, the second two you cannot give me. I cannot knowingly recruit active duty military and I cannot alter the flow of time.”

When the conversation among the officers abated Admiral Blu’uche’ese felt it was his turn to speak up. “Ultimately my fleet is needed on the front line. I can wait, especially if I’m receiving retrofits, but I cannot wait forever. How long would any needed work on my fleet take? A naval campaign may be slow, often on the scale of decades, but I cannot wait for years.”

“If it’s just the new ammoforge systems? One week. If you wish to wait around, I’ve been doing a lot of analysis on Ghlark’s and Doane’s fleet and have begun coming up with countermeasures to the damage that was done by the ‘Flashbang’ weaponry. Installing the new Thicc Wire systems will take two, at most three weeks depending on if I can think up any new improvements midway through.” Prime paused to sip at his coffee more out of a need to hide a smirk than a need for virtual caffeine. “I apologize for the undue delays. If I were to start adding things from your wish list, I might have to push back releasing your fleet to combat for a whole month from today once you add training and familiarization with new systems.”

“A…month? You’re asking a whole month to rebuild my entire fleet from top to bottom!? That’s outrageous, absurd, insane! I’ve seen a Confederate yard take nearly a year to do standard maintenance on a cruiser, and you’re offering to strip my fleet down to beams and rebuild it in a month!” Blu’uche’ese sputtered. “And you have the utter gall to apologize for being *slow!?*”

“About how long will my fleet take to repair? Or Forewoman Doane’s” Ghlark asked.

“The hestlan refugee ships are civilian ships. They’re simpler and I don’t have to build equipment to nearly the tolerances required. They can be repaired to something resembling their original factory specifications within a week, or upgraded within a month much like Admiral Blu’uche’ese’s fleet. That should give them time to figure out what they’re doing with their lives going forward. The leebawian fleet though…” Prime winced.

“Erm, two to three months, at a minimum. Honestly, over half of your ships were operating more out of habit than anything else by the time they reached orbit. That’s also admitting I might not be able to reverse engineer your slip drives to repair them. They are an incredible tactical advantage but I must admit I’m still trying to wrap my processor around the mathematics. I’ve never seen anything quite like it.”

“Does that mean the Confederacy has surpassed humanity?” A telkan voice asked from behind Janet, full of smugness.

“Why yes, it does mean that after 38 thousand years the Confederate *Military* has outclassed TerraSol *civilian* technology.” Halee stated in a bitter voice, hopefully making it clear to the telkan marine in question he should keep his snout shut.

“Speaking on that note, Commodore you no longer need to pursue getting me examples of Navy sensor arrays. I’m basically swimming in examples now and can see where the extra bandwidth came from. My own algorithms will need some time to work out, but until then I can litter the system with sensors to make up for individual resolution.”

“Three months…” Ghlark gasped as the officers behind him looked utterly dumbfounded. “I was pretty sure half of my fleet was destined for the breakers and you’re going to rebuild it in three months?”

“Faster, meaner, and if you allow me to do so, reinforced by a fleet of my own making under your control.”

“Um, this is all impressive and all, it really is, but…” Sanglee swallowed as she worked up the courage to speak directly to Prime. “This isn’t going to delay the construction of the evacuation fleet for the population of this system? I understand you already promised them one before we arrived.”

“The first evacuation ark is scheduled to begin boarding in four hours. Boarding is expected to take from twenty four to thirty two hours, I am loading nearly a million people onto that ark after all, it takes time to do so safely. The next ark is nearly built and should be through it’s shakedown cruise in about a week, the third ark had its keel set down the day before yesterday.”

Sanglee gulped as she felt compelled to speak the question that appeared before her. “And what..happens to the arks after they reach their destination? Those are massive, and armed, ships. They're not going to simply disappear.”

“That’s up to the crews that have volunteered to serve. Their contract stipulates they must safely deliver their passengers to N’karoo which should still be off of the frontline of the mar-gite advance for another seven to eight years even in the worst case. If they have time they can return here. Or they can go to other systems to assist in evacuating them. Perhaps start running logistics for the Confederate Navy. Or…maybe the n’kar on N’karoo will ask them to help build a new war-time industrial base with all of the technology and knowledge I have loaded upon those ships. Though I may look like it to you, I am not truly one of the ancient old ones. My influence ends the moment a vessel leaves the Fiishyaahd system, I cannot control the crew's actions beyond that point.”

Sanglee just stared at the holographic human as he smirked and turned his attention back to addressing the two naval fleets, getting their input on the systems they wanted Prime to design and install for them. “It’s like…this can’t be happening. It’s like something out of a myth…”

She turned around when she heard n’kar giggles behind her to see one of Paperpu’usher’s secretaries. He stood there with deep blue fur other than his hands and the ridge down his back which were a glittering, metallic gold.

I'm not on medication and don't do any strenuous activity. I do drink a lot of caffeine, usually 2 large cups of coffee a day. I have a history with anemia / eating disorder and severe chronic nosebleeds in the past which could all possibly be related, but unsure.

I randomly passed out for no reason a few months ago and ended up going to the ER. Before I passed out, I had a migrane for several days before, ringing in the ears, lots of pins and needles. The person that was talking to me before I passed out said I suddenly went blank for minutes (standing up not responding, just staring) before I stumbled forward and passed out. I hit my head on the fall, not sure if it was serious.

I did some blood tests at the ER, but everything came back normal. They claimed it was probably because I was on my period at the time and was post miscarriage, so therefore I just lost too much blood. However, my blood test were completely normal so I'm not sure where that came from.

After this, I started noticing I get dizzy whenever I stand up, have severe double vision, issues with depth and balance, and an increase in my migraines since then. Not sure if this is related, but my nose runs randomly for no reason (clear liquid that's watery), but no symptoms of allergies. I also have noticed some ringing in my ears. However, I do spend a lot of time on my computer for college, so it’s possible these symptoms could be related to the migraines from eye strain.

I have pretty bad health anxiety, so I'm always second-guessing myself. I just don't want there to be an issue with my brain. Should I be concerned about this?",2,1767303161.0,AskDocs,2,0.75,False

My preferences are in order as follows;

Reese:
I love peanut butter and chocolate. The mix of part cake, part cheesecake really makes this for me. It’s a new adventure every bite!

Cinnabon / Coconut:
Can’t decide on which is the true 2nd here… i love the chocolate snd coconut macaron crust of the coconut creampie, but the cinnamon and vanilla crunch cake just slaps. The cream cheese frosting mixed with caramel is just *chefs kiss*.

Adams:
Love the peanut butter and butterfinger bits. The fudge and caramel laced at the bottom makes this feel so decadent without being overly heavy.

Toasted marshmallow:
I love the toasted marshmellow and graham cracker crust, but this thing is a bit too chocolate forward. If it balanced the marshmellow and graham cracker out a bit more this one would be tops for me. 

Tiramisu:
Sleeper hit. Not too sweet, nice and light, great dollop on top. I like coffee, but if I loved coffee this would be at the top. I like the texture variety of cake, lady fingers and cheesecake. 

Caramel Turtle:
Sleeper hit, I like the brownie but that’s all it has going for it in my mind. The cheesecake itself is good, and cheesecakes that have the flavor dollop on top always get an extra boost. 

Snickers:
I feel like this one is just smaller than the others, which makes me sad when I get it… lol. Otherwise the ingredient spread is great.

Salted Caramel:
Like the Pecan Brownie, but the cheesecake itself isn’t as good and there’s no top dollop ;(. 

Red Velvet:
I genuinely did not like this one. It was just bland to me?

Right now I’m leaning toward the Tuxedo, but have been meaning to try the Triple Berry. Someone described it as gogurt, which massively turned me off. White chocolate raspberry sounds ok, just too one-note. Godiva sounds like it’s great, but pretty chocolate intense.

so we met at the coffee place, i hugged her as we greeted and said she looked nice and got her a tea, we chatted for a bit, eventually she asked if we could go for a drive, said she really wanted to kiss me, long story short we went to my car, once inside she asked how good of a kisser i am.

we drove around a bit, she liked holding my hand and said she liked physical touch, she said she liked it when guys kissed her kneck and touched her thigh, we held hands when driving, i was honest said since i didnt know her that i was kind of more reserved and holding back, seemed right since wed just met online and that she was in my car, i didnt want to make her uncomfortable, she seemed cool with me being reserved.

so we drove and talked before stopping off at a McDonalds and went in for food, she hugged me inside and was quite tactile with me, i put my arm round her, then we kissed, we ate and got back in the car and drove around and chatted more.

so we ended up stopping in a car park of a supermarket since she needed the toilet, we kissed more, we both went in and went toilet, we were holding hands and i smacked her butt playfully, she liked that, we finished up in the shop and went toilet and made out a lil bit in the car before driving off again.

so it came time to drop her off at her place, i wasent quite sure where things were going to end up going, i was up for a 2nd date but was also up for a hook up if she was, i walked her to her door, we kissed, hugged and she went in and i drove home.

so she confirmed that shed like a 2nd date the day after online and weve decided to go to the cinema in a few days, im not sure how to play things from here, since i do like her but the first date was more full on than i expected, i thought wed just get coffee and chat for an hour or two, it kind of feels like weve skipped some of the early relationship stuff.",1,1767303014.0,dating_advice,5,0.67,False

This post is a reminder that evil people exist. This morning I delivered to a woman named Latisha. It was a coffee and a bagel and UE was paying $12 for 2 miles so I jumped on it.

I ended the trip, looked at the app and realized the $12 was all fare $ from UE and no tip. Then the kicker is, she promptly downvoted me so now I stand deactivation. 
Why would someone do that? Please don’t tell me Latisha was having a bad day. Does she not like white women? Does she not realize I know where she works?

This past year I bought a Cafelat Robot and a J-Ultra and spent the time learning how to make a passable espresso.

Last part ended with me (F, 20) blocking my situationship, Leo (M, 22), while drunk. Let me tell you that while I made this decision on a whim, I really suffered with how much I missed him.

Yes, he didn’t sound like a good guy at all, but after my ex I was in a frail position and he was good enough. 

While we were going no-contact, I spent a lot of time trying to understand what I wanted from my relationships. Thankfully, I met a great friend that I shared very productive conversations with and who inspired me to be better as a person. I also went to a girls trip, and had a blast, which ended up being exactly what I needed to get over Leo.

After I got back, I was more relaxed, friendlier, more positive, and going on dates. Things were looking bright. 

Until one of my acquaintances hosted a masquerade for Halloween. I was really excited to go, and already ordered my costume for the occasion. Still, when I checked the group chat, Leo’s “friends” were there. I had no problem with them, however I wondered if he was going to come.

In the mean time, I had unblocked him on instagram, but still didn’t follow him. And because I was trying something new, I left my profile open. Leo used to constantly watch my stories, which was obviously very confusing for me. I decided to not think about it, though. I had friends, I was more consistent with my studies, and I was finally starting to enjoy my exchange.

When the masquerade arrived, I was quite nervous, but I was pretty sure Leo wasn’t going to come - and he didn’t. I spent the night talking to my friends and ignoring his “friends”, that was, until one of my friends asked them why he didn’t come and they replied with “the reason is walking around here somewhere”. My friends told me that meant I won the breakup - that I should be happy that he cared so much. 

Instead, that made me feel extremely self-conscious. I instantly headed to the toilet and started to sob. I didn’t understanding a thing. Maybe it was the excessive drinking, or just that I still missed him, but it hurt so much. Everything hurt - how he didn’t want to be near me, and that made me think that I hurt him; how if he cared so much, why wouldn’t he reach out to me; how I still cared about him… everything came crashing down.

I recomposed myself and went back to the party. Since it was a house party at a condo facility, we had to go somewhere else since it closed early. We all decided to head to the club via metro. In the way, I started to talk to Leo’s “friends” - his flatmate (M, 21) and his flatmate’s best friend (M, 21). 

At this point, we were all taking the piss since we were all pretty drunk, but I noticed them texting him and sending pictures of me, which made me sob once again. It was very humiliating to be treated like a zoo animal, but I pretended nothing was wrong. 

Since I couldn’t calm myself down, I called my best friend Ethan (M, 22) to help me understand what was going on and relax. He advised me to go home and said Leo would never deserve me. I decided to stay and commit myself to enjoy the night in spite of what was going on.

At the queue in the club, Leo’s flatmate, let’s call him Paul, and we started to talk a lot. We talked about silly stuff first, like this really random town where he lived before and was kind of an inside joke. Then we started to talk about Leo and a lot of things that are wrong with him. I told Paul Leo used to say that they weren’t really friends, and Paul knew that. He told me at their place Leo didn’t speak at all, and just talked to him out of convenience and because he didn’t have any other friends. According to Paul, Leo just stayed in his room playing clash royale for days at a time. He told me Leo didn’t see a point in anything there, so if anything required effort he would just drop it. 

Then I told Paul that I noticed them taking pictures of me and sending it to Leo, and although I didn’t say anything, that made me feel ridiculous. He told me they weren’t making fun of me, and that Leo takes me quite seriously. I asked him if it was true that he didn’t come because of me, and he say it was. I felt awful. I told Paul that the only thing I wanted was for things to be back to normal with Leo, not even romantic. Just not feeling this tension.

Paul told me he would mention it in a conversation, I said he shouldn’t bring it up. It’s just a random wish I had. 

After this, the conversation shifted away from Leo and me and Paul just talked about ourselves. We talked about our childhoods, growing up, our dreams, relationships, and lives. We talked the entire night, and since we lived near each other, we walked home together. However, one thing lead another and I ended up going to his place, mind you, where Leo lives. I don’t know if he ever found out about this.

Nothing happened, but it almost happened. I think we both held back a lot that night, but somethings slipped. Paul told me that night was the most fun he’s ever had since he started the exchange. And I think I said “Me too”. I’m pretty sure we were both attracted to each other, but it would never happen.

At 5 am, I decided to go home. Paul messaged me asking if I got home safe (which Leo never did) and asked me what I was going to do the next day. I told him I was going to a beach club, and he told me he could come with me. At the time however, he changed his mind and said he needed to do some extra work since he had trip planned.

I still don’t know if that was an excuse or not, but well, what was I going to do? 

Anyhow, while I’m processing all of these new feelings for Paul, Leo approached me at uni. I was shocked by his approach and asked him if he hated me. He asked me if I wanted him to hate me, I told him no. He asked me why, and I lied and said “no reason”. 

I realised I couldn’t take it, so I messaged him that I didn’t understand him at all. I told him about the masquerade, that people told me he didn’t come because of me. And he lied, he said no one invited him (I saw his invitation) and that he didn’t know anyone (he did). That moment I realised he would never give me the closure I deserved.

After this, things moved usually. I went on some dates and tried to enjoy myself, but he was stuck in my mind once again. I don’t know what he did to me, but I was once again obsessed with him.

At this another Halloween party (one I didn’t go because I was on a date), one of my friends saw Leo dressed up as Shrek, and I had to ask him if that was really him. He told me it was just a green face to be a clash royale goblin and not Shrek. I thought the interaction would end there, but then he asked me if I could help him find someone who would sublet his apartment. 

Obviously I said fuck no. I told him that whenever I needed him he was never there for me. He didn’t let me stay at his place when the issue with my flatmate happened, and even used me to get free drinks at the club. He then said that if out of any kindness of my heart I decided to do it, he would appreciate it. 

I reflected a lot, but I decided a dose of good karma never hurt anyone, so I sent it to the spring exchangers group chat (it’s important to mention that everyone in this story except for me was going in an exchange for 6 months, whereas I would be staying the full year). Multiple people replayed and I directed them to him.

We started talking normally after that and trying to help each other with some stuff. For instance, we both went looking for calculators together for finance exams. 

Also, at some point his twin came to visit him and I wanted to meet her. This didn’t happen, but I invited them both to this house party I was throwing - they didn’t go because his sister’s flight was on the same day and she was too tired. 

He also reached out to me for some things, such as trying to figure out his cheat sheets, or how I was doing with some work. We even went to the exchangers goodbye together and I won him a computer pouch - which he decided he didn’t want anymore after I won it. 

Then it was time for him to leave. I was wrecked. I still wanted to do so many things with him, tell him so many things. And I felt so stupid for wasting so much time. Weirdly enough I still feel. I asked him if he had time to get a coffee with me after his last exam (also the day of his flight), but he couldn’t make it.

I spent the night sobbing. I felt so dumb. I felt so weak. At least he had told me we would see each other again eventually. 

After he left I resigned myself to the thought of never speaking to him again - at least that would be the most logical alternative. But I don’t know, I couldn’t help but want more time with him. I asked him about a class he took that I wanted to take, or any excuse to just talk to him for a bit. He was very dry, though. Way more than usual. 

Nonetheless, he reached out for me when his results came out and we talked a bit (this was last week), and I messaged him about some stuff which he didn’t reply - later he replied, but seemed a bit annoyed.

Then, at new years he unfollowed me out of the blue. I have no idea how to interpret this, how to read it, or even how to feel about it. I feel like a stupid New Year’s resolution - “start your year with no situationships”. ",1,1767302507.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

For a context, we all know each other since highschool. Specifically one of those friends ever since I met him I had been hoping that he is gay (I think everyone has that kind of straight friend). 
So every time we would hang out he would be a little too close to me (touching my tigh, brushing his hand on my ass etc. Every possible way that can be taken as a joke)

Last night we were drinking and dancing, most of the night he was standing behind me with his hands on my waist, lightly grinding his cock on my ass (I didn't know how to react). I laid on the couch to sober up a bit and he jumped on me and forced my head into his armpits (for maybe a minute or so). When we all got tired I went to sleep on a one person inflatable mattress... and he laid next to me. I fell asleep pretty fast, but when I woke up in the middle of the night he had his arm and leg wrapped around me, and his head on my shoulder.

This morning when we woke up we drank coffee etc... He continued drinking I stopped cuz I was feeling well. I laid again on my stomach on the mattress. He laid on top of me and he started ""pounding"" my ass with clothes. He thought he was funny.


Keep in mind I'm not out yet... And that everything was happening in front of 5 other friends.

How to Disconnect Outside Connections to Your Computer","A computer, like a home, is not meant to be sealed from the world—but it *is* meant to have doors.  
Security is not paranoia; it is **intentional boundaries**.

This article explains how to **quietly and safely disconnect inbound connections** to your computer using a single Windows command, what that command truly does, and how to use it step by step—without panic, without jargon, and without breaking your system.

# What “outside connections” really mean

When your computer is connected to the internet, two kinds of traffic exist:

* **Outbound**: your computer reaching out (websites, updates, downloads)
* **Inbound**: other machines trying to reach *you*

Most everyday use only requires **outbound** traffic.  
Inbound traffic is only needed for things like:

* Remote Desktop
* Game servers
* File sharing
* Development servers you explicitly run

If you are not intentionally hosting something, **there is no reason to accept inbound connections**.

# The philosophy of the firewall

A firewall is not a wall—it is a **doorman**.

It asks a simple question:

>

The command below tells the doorman something very gentle and very firm:

>

# The command that closes the door

    netsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,allowoutbound
    

# What this command does (in plain language)

* `netsh` A built-in Windows tool for network configuration
* `advfirewall` Refers to the Windows Advanced Firewall
* `set allprofiles` Applies to *all* network types:
   * Public (coffee shop Wi-Fi)
   * Private (home network)
   * Domain (work/school)
* `firewallpolicy blockinbound,allowoutbound`
   * **Block inbound** connections (nothing can connect *to* you)
   * **Allow outbound** connections (you can still browse, update, and download)

# The result

✔ Internet still works  
✔ Browsers still work  
✔ Updates still work  
✘ No one can connect *into* your computer

This is **not destructive**.  
This is **reversible**.  
This is **calm control**.

# Step-by-step: how to use it

# Step 1: Open Command Prompt (Administrator)

1. Press **Windows Key**
2. Type: `cmd`
3. Right-click **Command Prompt**
4. Click **Run as administrator**
5. If prompted, click **Yes**

You should see a black window with white text.  
This is the command line—the place where the system listens carefully.

# Step 2: Run the command

Paste this line exactly:

    netsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,allowoutbound
    

Press **Enter**.

# What you should see

    Ok.
    

That single word means the door is closed.

# What happens immediately after

* Any existing inbound connections are dropped
* New inbound attempts are refused
* Your computer becomes **non-addressable** from the outside
* Malware cannot “phone home” *into* you
* Remote access attempts fail silently

You haven’t vanished from the internet—you’ve simply stopped answering knocks you didn’t invite.

# How to reopen the door (when you choose)

Nothing is permanent unless you want it to be.

To return Windows to its default behavior:

    netsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy allowinbound,allowoutbound
    

This restores normal inbound rules.

# When this command is appropriate

This command is ideal when:

* You want peace of mind
* You are troubleshooting suspicious behavior
* You are on public Wi-Fi
* You do not need remote access
* Your computer feels “too busy” or exposed

It is **not** a sign of fear.  
It is a sign of awareness.

# A final thought

Security is not about assuming danger everywhere.  
It is about knowing **where you end and the world begins**.

This command does not isolate you.  
It simply reminds the machine:

1q1ffm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q1ffm6/entering_back_into_the_world_of_espresso_4000/,Entering Back into the World of Espresso [$4000],"Thinking of jumping back into this. Some background:

Started off with a Breville Barista Express using the built in grinder, tamp, etc....the machine didn't last too long and the workflow was pretty slow for my liking. I'd have loved to just steam milk at the same time the shot was coming out. Half the time my coffee would be luke warm by the time the milk was done and cleaning while I go. Very annoying.

Steaming milk took forever as well. So, I went back to a nespresso machine and I'm spending about $80/mo in pods, which is a lot. (2 drinks a day, or more). The Breville wasn't worth the money to me to buy it again.

I've done a bit of research. ***Budget is $4k, could go much higher but I want to get a 3D Printer, and invest a bit of money into my flight sim setup as well. Otherwise that would be closer to 6.5k total. I don't think I'd be willing to give those two avenues up, and I am thinking $4k should be plenty. Maybe I'm wrong and you guys convince me otherwise. I could put the 3D Printer on the back burner and buy a few months down the line... Just including this as context as I feel it's important when buying at the moment.***

Beans I'd be using for reference:

Did discover [https://www.lacolombe.com/products/nizza](https://www.lacolombe.com/products/nizza) via reddit posts, might be willing to try it...but unsure atp.

I make Cappacuino/Latte drinks. Double shots.

Grinders I've researched:  
\---------------------------  
Option 1: Zerno Z1 - Looks great asthetics wise, price is $1751 configured with upgraded UH burs - mfc is in Chicago, IL, so no tariff issues. The other concern is the very high pitched grind sound that comes from this thing. I fear it would be like nails on a chalk board every morning.

Option 2: Mazzer Philos - Looks great asthetics, price is \~$1600 with upgraded Mazzer Philos I189D 64mm Burrs. Most places in US have this in stock, so dont think tariff issues. Has deeper grunty grinding sound, wouldn't bother me at all I'm sure.

Machines:  
\-----------  
ECM Synchronika II - $4k - Blows the budget, goodbye 3D Printer til later...looks very nice, not sure if the price increase is really worth it from the other options.

Profitec RIDE - Looks absolutely stunning in black, has less chrome which is nice.

Profitec DRIVE - $3600 All chrome, not sure this would fit in with the looks I'm going for (I like black / walnut looks, white cream colors, stainless steel.

Ascaso Steel Duo - Great looking machine. $2095...but vibration pump vs the others are rotary. I'm guessing better longevity with the others.

Based on what I'm seeing the Profitec DRIVE is a complete skip as I'd just go ECM Synchronika II at that price point. The Profitec RIDE seems to be the best fit for asthetics, price, and features...the AScaso Steel Duo seems to be the ultimate value proposition.

I’m about to start making espresso at home with a Gaggia Classic and I’m looking for some straightforward advice.

I’m new to espresso but experienced with filter coffee and Aeropress. I’ll be making about two shots per day. Based in the EU (Netherlands), but recommendations don’t need to be EU-specific.

Questions:

1. Grinder recommendations in the €250–€600 range for espresso with the Gaggia Classic. What are people actually using and happy with for daily low-volume use?
2. Accessories that are genuinely worth getting when starting out. Baskets, portafilters, distribution tools, etc. What would you classify as:

* must have
* nice to have
* maybe later

1. The Gaggia Classic runs around 15 bar in the EU. Is it worth installing a 9 bar spring immediately, or better to keep it stock while learning?

\*\*Tuesday:\*\* Attended a networking event ($20 for transportation). It was great to connect with others in my field.  

\*\*Wednesday:\*\* Took a break to recharge and cooked at home to save money. Grocery run was $50.  

\*\*Thursday:\*\* Had a few interviews lined up, so I bought a new outfit for $100. Feeling hopeful!  

\*\*Friday:\*\* Met a friend for dinner ($40), which helped me unwind after a stressful week.

I’m looking for outside perspectives because I feel like multiple emotional layers are overlapping and I don’t want to make a decision based on confusion rather than clarity. I would like your opinions and maybe some related situation you might have lived.

I (31F) was with my ex(33M) for about 3 years. When we were together, I genuinely believed I would spend my life with him. He left me in 2019, quite suddenly and without very clear explanations, saying he needed to live his life and be alone. The breakup was extremely hard for me.

Since then, we had almost no contact except one phone conversation in 2023 to talk about how the relationship ended.

Fast forward to now: I’m currently in a relationship, but it hasn’t been going well for a long time. My current partner regularly talks to other girls (online and in real life), has been on dating apps, and even met one of them (allegedly to tell her he was in a relationship) but its almost nothing the exchange, it's more to pass the time I guess. Anyways... Every couple of months, we go through a crisis where he questions the relationship or talks about leaving. He’s kind, supportive, helps me daily. I genuinely like my day to day life with him except the talking with online people — but I don’t feel emotionally safe, and he doesn’t really talk about a future together. He now wants to move out of our apartment, but it feels more like a tactic to make me feel stress or sad and beg him to stay. Plus the living situation in our city is really hard its not like he can find something fast. Also he's from an other country and has no family here. He's studying and try to file his papers for immigration. Soo its a weird situation I can see that too.

Recently, my ex came back to my city (let’s say **Riverton**) for a couple of days. He now lives in **Seabrook** (so its a 12h drive + 4h boat), a remote island town. When he arrived in Riverton, he ran into a friend who told him they’d be working with me. He said that moment hit him like a shock and that he felt overwhelmed emotionally. Because he was only in town briefly, he insisted on seeing me.

We met for coffee. He told me he deeply regretted leaving me, that he never fully got over it, and that the wound was still very present. We both cried. He said he had wanted to come back to me many times but didn’t know how. He also strongly implied that he would be willing to live outside Seabrook if things were different.

Important context: we are *both* currently in relationships, and we both admitted that we haven’t completely moved on emotionally.

On my side, I’m conflicted. I know we’re not the same people we were years ago, and I’m realistic — there’s no concrete plan, no immediate future scenario. At the same time, part of me can imagine what a healthier, more mature version of that relationship *could* look like someday.

What’s confusing is that if my ex hadn’t reappeared, I think I would already have accepted that my current relationship is nearing its end — and that I’ve been holding on mostly out of fear of abandonment. The return of my ex didn’t create the problem, but it definitely stirred things up.

Now I don’t know how to act:

* Should I write to my ex or let things settle?

* Is it wiser to let time pass and regain emotional stability first?

* How do I know whether I’m feeling clarity… or just relief at being emotionally seen again?

Before he left, I asked my ex if we agreed that our conversation wasn’t really “finished,” and he said yes. He’s not very active on social media, so there’s been no contact since.

A part of me is deeply hurt and exhausted by my current relationship.
Another part of me can imagine revisiting something meaningful with my ex — not the past version, but a more evolved one. Or am I delusional? Should I ask questions?

I’m not asking who to choose.
I’m asking how to not lose myself in the overlap of endings, old wounds, and unresolved feelings.

I'm a newbie to espresso, and after researching, I decided to get the Breville Bambino as my first machine. It was delivered yesterday and I set it up this morning and was excited to pull my first shots! I read through the manual, and followed all the start up steps. Went through the initialization, ran a shot of just water through the portafilter/basket, etc. I used the double wall basket with 18g of coffee (I haven't settled on a grinder yet, so I had it ground at the coffee shop when I bought it).

When I ran the machine, only a few drops of espresso came out. When I removed the portafilter, the coffee was wet and muddy, all of the water had soaked in and nothing came out. I tried again with the single wall basket and had the same result. I tried without coffee and some water came out, but when I took the portafilter off, it was still filled with water. The hot water button and steam wand seem to be working fine.

I took this video of me pulling a shot with the single wall for my friend and figured it would be useful here. Am I doing something wrong or is my machine defective?

But at least I know I did my best,"this is my final update and thank you all. My mother today came to me to talk and apologised for her reaction and she also wanted me to know she truly doesn't believe he is cheating with her sister. But admited their interractions are making her sad because he is never that chill around her. In her opinion its just that her sister has a way with him she, herself, doesn't. And ended it all with saying that probably her sister would be a better match for my dad but asked me to never again come to her with such comments as I did recently. She repeated that she's sure he is not cheating with my aunt but even if he did, she doesn't want to live without  him. And she mentioned that the custody over my sister would also be a very sensitive topic.

I (18M) for the past 2 years have seen a weird dynamic between my father (46) and my mother's younger sister (34). If it matters, my dad is slavic, frome astern europe. Cma here young and poor.

My dad is a guy with status. He is the VP of company that has production and branches in 8 countries and is not exactly modest about it. No one is smart enough to give him advice. In his field I am sure he is very skilled. But no one knows better than him even with unrelated things like what furniture to buy, why the dog won't eat and stuff like that. When we eat, my mother puts the plate in his face, puts the food on that plate. And he looks around and is like: the recipe for this steak says it should be eaten without salt? And my mother instantly jumps up and brings the salt she forgot. I told him: you can bring it yourself if you need it.

He works long hours, meetings after meetings and then goes to jog or to the gym or during winter he goes to the pool to swim. 

This aunt is funny. 34, no kids and divorced with a history of affairs with married guys. Dad treats her differently than he treats everyone. He talks down to people and everyone is walking on thin ice around him. But my aunt doesn't. S was rubbing his arm: So, Mr. big boss, have you peeled potatoes yourself? Because they are the best and we all know only you can make ""the best"" things. And then she laughed. And he laughed too. He doesn't laugh with us. Dad's hobby is making wine. And he took my aunt to see the grapes and put a grape himself in her mouth. Or he was mowing the lawn and she said: oo Mr Engineer doing the ordinary man work. Where are your servants? He laughed.

People who work under him at the company or directly with him are under constant stress because he treats them like in military. When he is around people are tensed. She put her hand around his neck and said: what u say, bro in law, would you make me your secretary? and he laughed and said: you would beat my a..ss. She: and you would deserve that and winks. If my mother needs a ride he is always busy. but when my aunt called him at 10 pm to pick her up from the train station, he was at the office, but he went to pick her up.

I told Mom without using the word cheat. Just about my concerns and she got angry and threw a a coffee mug on the floor. She cried and said to never repeat such nonsense. She also called Dad to tell him ""what I did"".",20,1767302035.0,WhatShouldIDo,11,0.81,False

Place - Revere PD crime lab


After getting a call that the DNA results from the pussy blood found at both scenes has come back, Murphy and Corso are meeting with Revere police department forensics expert Jenna Bosco. Bosco is 24 years old, has blonde hair and blue eyes, cute with an athletic figure. Since joining the department, she has quickly become Murphy’s go to analyst due to her expertise and undeniable skills.


With coffee in hand both detectives step into the elevator to the basement, which had recently been upgraded into a full scale crime lab. The elevator door opens, Murphy instinctively places his arm over the threshold to hold the door for Corso as he steps out.  Murphy watches the tall young detective stride forward. He thinks about the first time he met him back when Corso was just a rookie filled with piss and vinegar. Murphy often tells the kid how he reminds him of himself when he was that old. Corso made the jump to detective as fast as anybody in the department. Murphy even vouched for him and helped push his promotion through, in hopes he would be able to mentor him before he retired in the next few years. The detectives walk briskly down the hall and hit the buzzer to enter, the glass doors slide open and they walk into the lab. Murphy bellows, ""Hey Bosco, give me some good news, we could use a win here...whaddya got?""


Bosco looks up from her monitor as Murphy and Corso walk between the desks inside the lab and gets up to meet them halfway. With a sarcastic tone, she quips while greeting the detectives, “Before we get to that...Murphy you look like absolute shit. When was the last time you got some sleep? She then turns her attention to Corso who is barely older than she is, ""And for fucks sake Corso, they haven't fired you yet?""


Corso laughs out loud sarcastically, then loudly sips his coffee and replies, ""My gainful employment is a mystery to us all... still good to see you too Jenna.”


Murphy gestures to the blood samples on the table in front of him while laughing as well but is here to get down to business. ""OK enough fucking around..I bet Corso 12 bucks it was pussy blood we found at both scenes...one of us is going to be right and one is going to eat some crow. Now it's time to pay up for one of us. Was I right or wrong? You know I can smell a drop of poon-aid in a raging river from 250 yards away.""


Bosco rolls her eyes at Murphy long enough to stop laughing and puts on her professional face before answering, ""I don't know how you knew but you're right Murphy. The darkfield microscope the captain got for us is amazing. Not only is it able to tell us everything about the blood that we want to know, like blood type, presence of drugs or alcohol, but in this case I could see there were skin cells from when the uterine wall sheds. This is 100% the blood from a pussy…from the looks of it she is a gusher too.""


Corso smile fades into a look of defeat, he shakes his head slowly in disbelief, ""No fucking way.""


Murphy triumphantly raises his arms above his head, imitating a touchdown, and laughs. He puts out his hand, palm up, gesturing towards the center. “C'mon Corso...12 bucks? Pay up.. a bet is a  bet.""


Corso hangs his head before he pulls his wallet out and hands over 12 singles. ""You know I was saving that money for this years Twerkathon at Tidday's."" 


Murphy sips his coffee. ""Ok Bosco..so we got a match? Who is she?""


Bosco replies quickly. ""Got no clue, she doesn't match anybody in our database. But there's more, the blood came from two different visits from aunt flow…""


Murphy is now the one with the look of amazement. ""Two different batches, how can you tell?"" 

Bosco walks over to her laptop and opens a small file. “See here. The skin cells that are present are aged differently, they break down over time like anything else. We can see the difference and get a time frame. The source of this blood came from the same woman but nearly a year apart as best we can tell.""


Murphy responds like a man who has been married for more than 20 years.”Are you telling me our killer is a woman and once she is on the rag she becomes a killer?""


Bosco laughs at how simple Murphy is. “No, no way it is a woman unless she can bench press Corso. The stab wounds on Finn didn't just hit soft tissue. The autopsy showed the knife got stuck in bone on at least three separate thrusts. Whoever killed Finn was pretty damn strong, a retard possibly. In any case you are probably looking for a guy who goes to the gym a lot.""


Corso utters. ""A football player?""


Bosco thinks about it for a second. “Possibly and he is around eight or nine nine-inch dicks tall, based on the angle of the wounds. These came in a downward motion."" Bosco picks up a pen and  demonstrates the swinging motion she believes was used. ""Then on Clausen, the blunt force trauma to the head was strong enough to shatter his cranium."" 


Murphy giggles at the unit of measurement Bosco chose. “Wait, did you just use a nine-inch dick as a unit of measurement? “


Bosco pulls up six separate images of skulls on a wall screen and without a pause says, “A girls gotta have her standards.”


Murphy looks down at his own crotch, shrugs his shoulders and says, “Fair play.”


Bosco continues to display the forensic photos from her files. “This one here is Clausen, you can see how the skull was crushed, leading to massive hemorrhaging.”


Murphy walks closer to the wall screen and points, ""What about this one?""


Bosco replies  ""That guy fell off his roof and landed on his head from about 21 nine-inch dicks up, he died on impact.""


Corso blushes, he is unwilling to even question how she arrived at this new system. He chooses instead to move on and then inquires about the next images, ""And these two? Holy shit it looks like someone hit them with a sledgehammer.”


Bosco nods her head. “Funny you should mention that. This is the skull of coach Gillbride.""


Murphy's voice has a touch of wonder in it, ""Kevin Gilbride? Didn't he get punched in the face by Buddy Ryan during a game once?""


Bosco laughs ""I'm not old enough to remember Murph. He died a few years ago in a pregame football stunt gone wrong.""


Corso excitedly responds, ""Fuck me, I remember that. He was coaching up in Buffalo and they paid Cannon Balls to come throw out the ceremonial first pass. Gilbride was wearing a helmet cam…craziest shit I ever saw. The ball hit him dead in the face, but he held on to it..was a helluva catch."" 


Bosco replies, ""Yeah, that was it. Even though he caught it, the ball still hit his face. Went right through the face mask and stuck in his skull. Catastrophic trauma killed him instantly.""


Murphy expresses clear admiration for the retired quarterback ""Man, Balls could really spin it..can't believe he managed to hold on to it. I watched that replay about 60 times.""


Corso shows deference to the deceased. ""Damn right he did...dude was a soldier. Anyway, what were you saying Bosco?""


Bosco jokingly replies, ""Now that you two are done with your hero worship. I was  saying whoever did this used pussy blood from the same woman with a bled on date more than 2 years apart.""


Murphy is unable to hide his shock. ""Mother fucker.. this is worse than I thought..we got a real sick son of a bitch on our hands here.""

1q1f4hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1q1f4hv/36m_my_reality_hit_me_like_a_freight_train/,"36M, my reality hit me like a freight train yesterday","I took a loooong break from the workforce in summer 2022 to be a fulltime, at home caretaker for my ailing dad who passed away in October 2024. I loved him very much and I fully felt grief for the first time. I wouldn't say it's something I regret, I spent tons of quality time with him but now I feel like I'm paying a heavy price. Part of the reason I took that break was I had various mental health issues of my own from a very stressful time in a big city, and thought being NEET for a while would help me recover, which it did. But still...

I took my time and just occasionally sent waves of applications after he passed but didn't devote every waking second to it like I should have. I landed a research job but blew it because I felt iffy that it wasn't in my original career field and it was fairly difficult, I just didn't take it seriously enough. All of my work history, already, is just low paid, lab tech type work, and spotty as well with employment gaps I have to explain. Years earlier my parents paid way too much of their savings so I could be enrolled in STEM oriented, private engineering school. I wish I could go back in time and explain to myself that even if I could solve and memorize equations out of textbooks, my intelligence might not necessarily translate to building an impressive career, or even fitting into society.

From this point now, I'm working really hard and sending out tons of apps but I feel like I'm living a nightmare. Dad is gone, Mom is 73 and \*still working\* only because she enjoys her job but she's really showing her age, it occurred to me I might almost be speaking to her ghost before she eventually passes. My 40 year old sister has much more severe mental problems than what I've ever shown and is unable to support herself, leaving me to eventually do it.

It just feels like I accepted too deeply for years that I was always different, awkward, childish, maybe on the spectrum, maybe just plain unintelligent, and I should just continue with playing my shooter games and my aimless drives for iced coffee or just driving around - instead of focusing on a career and trying to remain firmly in society. Two days ago, after not hearing back from an employer that I thought I really nailed the interview with, just set alight all these awful feelings. I feel like if I bust my ass now and find some job, I'm basically preparing to die alone relatively comfortably, maybe while supporting my sister along the way.

Anyways, if anyone is of a similar age and going through something similar, please share, it eases the pain.",2,1767301646.0,SuicideWatch,3,1.0,False

1q1f3vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalPapaya/comments/1q1f3vt/working_through_my_feelings_1126/,Working through my feelings [1/1/26],"God, I feel terrible. This depression has lasted two weeks. I’m sick of it.

There’s this weird sense of dread and stress and unhappiness. I don’t feel powerless, but I just feel like… I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s hard to describe.

I had a date on Sunday that I thought went well, but I’ve since been ghosted. I’m obsessively checking his online presence, and he seems alive and well. Checking is pointless, destructive behavior. I keep thinking “maybe he’ll text tonight” or “maybe he doesn’t have New Years plans and will reach out,” then obviously he doesn’t do that, and I suffer.

I’m craving attention, partly in response to being ghosted. I got dressed, then changed, then changed again before I left the house. I sat in a coffee shop for a long time (to the point of ordering a second drink to endlessly nurse) hoping… something would happen. What was I even expecting? Most men are not into men. Of the ones who are, how many of would check me out? And of those, would anyone come up to my table and confess their attraction in the middle of this coffee shop? Of course not. I sat there like a loner with a handsomely unhappy mien. I made myself unapproachable.

A song I like describes an approach to love where “the feeling is all or nothing.” I feel that way. I over-assign importance to the men I meet, which sets me up for failure. And the few successes inevitably end because I become avoidant. It’s all or nothing. I’m still in the “all” stage for this guy. I catch myself feeling betrayed, or otherwise spinning fictions about what he is thinking. But we chatted for a week and then went on one date. We’re not dating. There is no commitment there. Ghosting sucks, sure, but I’m letting it eat me alive.

I keep thinking, “should I go walk in the park, or by the river, or down the shopping street?” But I’m trying to recreate the coffee shop — be good looking, be unapproachable, hope to make eye contact, keep walking, feel worse. Why?

If I were still drinking, I’d be hunting down a drink right now.

Another frustrating thing is that I’m not allowing myself to do anything at all. I have work I need to do tonight, and its mere presence is killing me. So I am not allowed to play video games or watch TV or go out or do anything. I’m not done with my work, so it’s forbidden. I am forbidding it. So then I doomscroll, and I languish in my thoughts. Counterproductive.

I looked at the clock last night at 12:06. I missed the beginning of the new year without realizing. A fitting metaphor. Life is happening and I’m missing it.

But here I am, falling into my defeatist patterns. You are not missing life. You are not a piece of shit. This is mental illness talking. You are not forbidden from anything. You are not undesirable. Patterns are just patterns, not laws of the universe. You are not stuck.

I actually feel a little better now.

Think tactically. Lying in bed will not make things better. You are not tired enough to nap, so it only serves to immobilize you. Video games will either bore you or make you feel guilty. Doomscrolling is absolutely worthless. Checking Hinge again is stupid. Staying in this apartment at all is probably a bad idea. So leave.

If I leave, I shouldn’t burn time on a long walk or in a coffee shop. There’s nothing I need to shop for. So unless I am missing something, it seems like my best course of action is to get up, get some food, go to the office, and work. It sucks, but it needs to happen. Feeling productive might “cure” me, too.

What’s left to write about? Nothing. So farewell, journal. I need to get up.",1,1767301603.0,OriginalPapaya,0,1.0,False

The current regimen I’m on is cutting sugar and most carbs and switching to low carb options, and or sugar free options. 

For breakfast I eat a half pound of 93/7 Ground Beef mixed with onion and jalapeño. Sometimes I’ll have a low carb tortilla with that, also might have half an avocado or hard boiled egg 

Throughout the day I drink black coffee and water. Sometimes a protein shake.

After breakfast I’ve just been snacking on either a banana or pork rinds. And after 5pm I’ve been not eating till about 6am. 

I’m about to switch my entire schedule though due to me working night shifts..

My plan is to eat my ground beef and whatever else at lunch time during work. And eat a banana when I get home. And snack once I wake up, until lunch time. Which hopefully works out. The advice I’m looking for is do any of you perhaps have a better eating schedule I could do and do you think I’m going to hard to fast. 

My upcoming days will look like this

Friday - Monday

Wake up about 4pm

Start Work @ 6:30pm

Lunch @ 11:15pm

Off work 5pm

Fall asleep around 7-8am

I’ve also being doing some chest workouts, I walk between 5-15 miles at work as well.

For context, we work in different departments at the same company. It all seemed to start after a cross-department presentation we did together. We got to know each other a bit better, and after that her behavior around me noticeably changed.

At first, I noticed that when we were talking in a group, she’d suddenly seem more animated or excited but shortly after, she stopped speaking to me when others were around. From then on, she’d only talk to me when she knew I was alone, and she’d message me for a coffee while we were both in the office (always her initiating, and only when I was by myself).

At one point she complimented my looks, which caught me off guard. The way she looked at me felt… different, like it gave something away. She also became slightly more touchy, once briefly touching my chest before quickly pulling her hand back, like she realized she’d crossed a line. I didn’t react, just pretended not to notice. Soon on, I asked her for a lunch which she enthusiastically accepted and it went great.

Whenever we see each other, she gives me this specific smile, almost like she lights up, but I’m aware that could just be my interpretation.

More recently, she asked to catch up again. During that conversation, she seemed extremely nervous: fidgeting, smiling, looking away. I picked up on the tension and ended up feeling nervous myself, and I may have let that show a bit.

Then, on a recent office day, I was very busy and noticed her from across the room. All day she kept facing forward and never looked toward the back of the room. Toward the end of the day, I walked past her to answer a call. After I sat back down, I noticed that she looked back twice for the first time all day (once while turning to the side and the second while doing a full 360 turn to see behind) and even walked back to my area and glanced directly at me. I felt like she wanted to initiate contact, but I was clearly busy with headphones on so couldn't speak.

At that point, I got a strong sense that she might like me. Since I’m leaving the company in a couple of months, I decided it made more sense to initiate contact instead of just being reactive. When we next interacted, she seemed much more relaxed, happy, smiling almost constantly, but also very jumpy, giddy, and excited. That contrast confused me, especially since she’d been so nervous the last time.

So now I’m just trying to make sense of it all and wondering if now is the right time.",1,1767301371.0,dating,1,1.0,False

1q1exhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1q1exhr/midoriya_kidnaps_the_villains/,Midoriya kidnaps the villains,"Instead of the villains snatching Izuku Midoriya as usual, Midoriya decides to take the villains off the street himself.

Some motivations:

Vigilantism: stop them before they hurt anyone else.

Quirk analysis: understand how dangerous quirks work and how to counter them.

Fanboy obsession: collect “trophies” the way others collect memorabilia—only his trophies are very, very alive.

This can be a light, more crack fic (Midoriya with villain action figures and embarrassing photos) or a darker, grounded story (ethical grey areas, psychological strain, legal consequences).

Small example:

He tells himself it’s for analysis.

The plan reads like a lab protocol in his head: reconnaissance, containment, questioning, observation, exit. He’s written it down on sticky notes and folded them into the pocket of his jacket like talismans. He tells himself it’s for everyone—the families, the civilians, the teachers who keep saying to “follow the rules.”

The alley smells of rain and oil; the fluorescent light at the end buzzes like a failing heartbeat. Midoriya moves as quietly as his knees will allow, one careful step at a time. He has practiced this; he has run scenarios until the edges are smooth.

The villain is smaller than the broadcasts made him out to be. He is not cinematic in the moonlight. He is folded into himself, clutching a metal pipe with shaking fingers, eyes darting like a trapped animal, not the confident wrecking ball he has seen in grainy footage.

“Stay still,” Midoriya says. His voice—oddly steady—carries in the cold. The villain lunges. Midoriya moves before he can think about the danger; he moves because he has mapped the physics in his head. He wraps an arm around the villain’s shoulders, using leverage to take the pipe away, and the other hand comes up, fingers finding the throat of the jacket the villain wears. A tackle, a roll, and the villain is pinned against wet bricks.

Midoriya’s lungs burn. He tastes copper; his palms feel raw. There is no who can here, no one who can stop him, only quiet and the pulse in his ears. “I’m not—” the villain pants. “You can’t—”

“I know,” Midoriya says, and the words surprise him with how small they sound. He does not sound like a hero calling down the thunder. He sounds like a kid with a library of polaroids and a drawer full of questions. “I’m sorry. I’m doing this because I need to know.”

He has a hooded bag slung over his shoulder. Inside are restraints designed not to maim, data pads with recorded quirk profiles, a compact sedative he learned to administer safely from an old volunteer nurse at the hospital, and a single, ridiculous thing: a laminated index card with the villain’s name and a hand-drawn star next to the entry, because habit dies hard.

The villain twists, eyes narrowing. He laughs, bitter and incredulous. “You think taking me will solve anything? You think you can play hero?”

Midoriya forces the restraints closed, fingers trembling. “I don’t want to hurt you,” he says. “I want to understand you. If I understand you, maybe I can stop you. Maybe I can stop others like you.”

It’s a clumsy, terrible justification. He knows it. But as rain turns brick to gloss and sirens wail somewhere distant, Midoriya feels the worst part of the truth unwind in his chest. He is doing this because he can’t stand the idea of being helpless again.

He hauls the villain to his feet and cinches the bag strap tighter. Tonight will not be a headline. Tonight will be a pile of careful notes and coffee that tastes like worry. Tonight, he will learn.",11,1767301180.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,1,0.92,False
1q1ex6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1q1ex6e/i_went_cold_turkey_and_it_was_fine/,I went cold turkey and it was fine!,"Idk why I was so worried in the past doing long drawn out tapers. I'm on day 5 right now and already completely over all withdrawals and feel great. 

That being said, I've only been back on drinking a cup of coffee a day for about 6 months after going 6+ months off and a month on here and there over the last couple years so got the worst of it out of the way. The first time I quit it took 4 months of being caffeine free to feel like a normal person again.

I'm a little tired but not much more than usual. The first time I quit I was napping every day for weeks. Only had one nap this week. Headaches on day 2 and 3 but gone by day 4. That being said I've fixed anemia and b12 deficiency in the last year as well so overall energy levels are much better. 

My point is I guess that stopping without a taper could be a great option if you have had long periods caffeine free in the recent past or drink 1 cup or less of coffee a day.",5,1767301159.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1q1et3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q1et3p/just_another_summer_in_95_pt2/,Just Another Summer In ‘95 pt2,"We both drove back to the station and handed in our gear and changed. I could still smell the faint odor clinging to my uniform. I suppressed the urge to gag as I threw it back into my locker without any finesse, just wanting to get it off me. I changed into a pair of cutoff jean shorts and my UCSD hoodie.

I bumped back into Felix on my way to my car. He was wearing that stupid Denver Broncos windbreaker like it was his best suit. He looked almost as exhausted as me. We both exchanged a tired “hey” to each other.

“I’m going to Norm’s. You wanna come with? I’m buying.”

I tried to let out a chuckle, but it only came out as a weak exhale.

“That old place? Just this once… I-I need a drink,” I stammered, trying to keep it together. Last thing I wanted was to put on the waterworks in front of him. Felix’s gaze softened as he quieted for a moment.

“Me too, Ash…c’mon, I’ll drive, alright?”

I sniffled once, and he put a hand on my back and gently ushered me to his truck. We didn’t say much as we climbed into his truck, and he started to drive toward the town.

I gazed out the dim window into the dark outlines of the pines. My head pounded with the aftershock of pure adrenaline leaving my body. I clenched my fists tightly as I felt my hands continue to tremble. I let out a couple of unsteady breaths to control my breathing; it helped a little. I finally mustered up what little confidence I had and turned toward Felix. His eyes were focused on the road, but I could tell he noticed, with how tightly he clenched his jaw.

“I’m-”

He quickly cut me off before I could finish.

“You have nothing to be sorry for.”

I let out a quiet sigh and let myself relax a little. I wasn’t really in the mindset to argue with Felix. The one question that had been swirling in my mind:

“What…was that?”

Felix’s expression darkened as his eyes flickered to me and then back to the dimly lit road ahead.

“Between you and me…I heard some whispers from the badged rangers about this.”

My brow furrowed as more questions flooded my brain. I turned my head and quietly asked him,

“You knew about this?”

He shook his head a few times.

“I thought it was a spike in chronic wasting or rabies… or anything just not… that.”

I didn’t know what to say, but my hand slid across the center console, just short of touching him. I didn’t know why; I just didn’t want to feel alone after that, just to feel close to someone for a moment. I felt his hand squeeze my arm just for a second before he withdrew his hand.

I retreated my hand back to my seat and stared ahead wordlessly. We didn’t say anything else the entire ride into town. The small town was dead quiet in these later hours of the night. The only place that was still open was that shitty gas station and Norm’s bar.

The truck drove past the main street, if you could call it that. Until we reached the edge of one of the last blocks before it turned into scattered neighborhoods.

On the street corner was our destination: Norm’s, the only place to get a drink besides the old liquor store on the edge of town that closed after seven. It didn’t look like much from the outside: concrete brick walls stained from decades of cigarette smoke and spring thaws, a slightly angled roof to keep the snow from piling up in winter. One-way windows only hinted at the warmth inside, backlit by a flickering neon Coors Light sign hanging above the glass door.

Felix parked along the curb and gave me a nod before stepping out. I didn’t move at first, exhausted in a way I couldn’t even begin to explain. After a weak sigh, I followed him in.

The bar was dimly lit, low-hanging lights casting long shadows across wood-beamed walls. A few regulars sat on worn vinyl stools, nursing nearly-empty beers and clutching half-spent cigarettes. The thick scent of tobacco hit me like a punch to the gut.

We passed through the vestibule into the main bar. A battered jukebox flickered quietly in the corner. Across the room, a doorway opened into a second space I couldn’t quite see. A woodstove, untouched and cold in the summer months, leaned close to the doorway.

Norm leaned against the back counter, the flashing Rainier sign behind him casting a dull red glow across his lined face as he wiped down a glass. Felix settled onto a seat at the bar, but I didn’t follow him, not yet. My gaze drifted to the jukebox as it quietly played For What It’s Worth. For some reason, the usually calming twang of Springfield didn’t quite sit right with me, not tonight.

I quietly cycled through the different CDs, quickly noticing it didn’t have anything newer than ’88. I grumbled softly as I cycled CDs to something my dad liked to listen to on the porch during the weekends: Gimme Shelter.

I dug into my pocket for some loose change and fed the machine a pair of quarters. My gaze shifted as I noticed the dark form of a dog. Maybe a lab if you squinted, laying across his worn bed next to the jukebox. I smiled softly as I watched this dog snore softly as he rested his blocky head on his paws. The jukebox started to play my song. The dog let out what I could best describe as a grumble as he lifted his greying muzzle to gaze up at me. His ears flicked in what might have been a judgmental stare at the jukebox as it played the Rolling Stones tune.

I let myself smile as I kneeled down to him and softly scratched behind his floppy ears.

“Did I wake you? I’m sorry, sweetheart.”

His tail thumped once on the tile floor as he leaned into my hands with another grumble. I peered at his leather collar to see he shared the name of the beer of questionable quality, Busch. I let out a quiet chuckle barely audible even to myself. I patted the lounging dog once more before standing up.

As I walked back, I caught the gaze of one of the regulars just for a moment before he dropped his gaze to his beer. I didn’t linger on this as I sat down at the bar next to Felix.

Norm nodded at me as he poured Felix a draft. When he finished, he turned my way.

Definitely a local through and through; mullet and handlebar stache, faded denim trucker jacket, aviator-style glasses. A black hat with the outline of some Navy ship sat low on his head; the words USS OKINAWA stitched across the front.

“Evenin’, miss. What can I getcha?”

I hesitated a beat.

“Um… just a coffee.”

He raised a bushy eyebrow at the request but didn’t protest.

“Black?”

I nodded quietly. I didn’t bother asking for cream or sugar—wasn’t sure why I hadn’t. Norm grabbed the old coffee pot, probably left simmering on the burner since morning, and poured a mug full of what smelled like the same brand they left out for us at the station; burnt, bitter, and somehow still comforting. He set it down gently on the bar.

I offered a soft “thanks” and let my eyes drift to the bottles lined up behind him.

“I’ll…take a glass of Wild Turkey with it. Neat.”

Norm gave a small, unreadable nod and glanced over at Felix. The two men shared a look, brief but heavy, before he turned back and poured out the bourbon. He placed the glass beside the coffee with a soft clink.

I murmured another thank you and, without ceremony, poured the contents of the glass straight into the mug. I cupped the plain ceramic in both hands, letting the heat soak into my palms before lifting it to my face.

The scent hit me hard: scorched, cheap coffee laced with the sharp bite of mid-shelf whiskey. I took a careful sip.

The bitterness and the burn slid down my throat and bloomed warm in my chest. I let out a soft, strained exhale as the sting settled across the roof of my mouth, like I was breathing through the ache.

I heard a soft grumble from behind me. I craned my head to see the dark form of the bartender’s dog padding over from his bed. He plopped himself against my leg as he flopped over with what I could best describe as a dog sigh. I smiled into the mug and leaned and trailed my fingers along his forehead; he thumped his tail lazily in response.

Felix looked over from his beer at the dog sprawled out on my foot and chuckled a bit. “He must like you.”

“Busch usually only gets up when you drop an egg,” the bartender remarked as he stooped and dug through a mini-fridge, bringing out a bright packet of Wonder Bread.

I shrugged sheepishly and mumbled, “I guess he does-”

On the counter, two jars sat in cloudy liquid, eggs in one, jerky in the other. The brine was so murky it was hard to tell if the eggs had been in there for weeks or years. The strips of meat looked handmade, maybe bison, maybe something else. Something with too many tendons.

The rack nearby sagged under greasy snack bags, but the fluorescent light above it flickered just enough to make the colors look wrong. The pickled sausages looked almost pink in the shifting light, like fingers in vinegar.

The old cigarette machine crouched against the paneling, a faded Kool’s logo glowing faintly above it. No buttons, just brass pull knobs dulled to a sickly bronze. A paper label above the slot warned: “3.50 quarters only,” the ink blurred from years of greasy hands. Behind the warped glass, the packs looked swollen and pale, their colors leeched away, brands barely legible through the plastic haze.

I looked over at Felix as he nursed his lager. He clutched the half-full glass tightly; even now, I could still see his fingers trembling from the aftershock. He wasn’t looking at me, whether because he felt I needed space or he didn’t know what to even say at this point. I couldn’t tell. His gaze was focused on the only TV in the bar.

The blocky CRT hanging behind the bar played a game show that looked familiar, though I couldn’t quite name it. A glamorous blonde in heels and a sparkly red dress moved with the kind of easy, practiced grace that made it look effortless. She walked between glowing panels, flipping them one by one as the audience applauded every nervous guess. The woman was beautiful; tall, slim, with the kind of posture that probably took a lifetime to learn. The tinny bar speakers couldn’t keep up with the canned clapping and chimes, but it didn’t matter. She held the screen just fine without sound.

“You ever wear a dress like that, Ash?” Felix asked, still nursing his beer.

I let out a soft snort. “Please. I don’t have legs like hers.”

Felix chuckled, gave his glass a small tilt. “Didn’t break any hearts back home, Miss San Diego?”

I shook my head, a little quieter now. “Me and dating never really worked out. Not exactly a looker.”

“Hasn’t stopped the newer volunteers from running into trees around you,” he said with a chiding smile.

“They’re just dumb kids, Felix,” I dismissed with a wave of my hand.

“Kids can be pretty honest, Ash,” he replied, matter-of-fact.

“Shaddup, old man,” I grumbled, hiding a forming smile behind my mug as I took a sip.

I quickly caught a familiar smell. The kind that drifts through dorm kitchens back home at UCSD. The aroma of grilled cheese browning on a hot pan. Glancing over, I spotted the bartender cooking a pair of sandwiches on a hot plate tucked into a tiny corner beside a plain white microwave and toaster oven.

He slid two paper plates silently across the bar. one with a freshly made grilled cheese for me, the other a classic hangover special: fried bologna and cheese. I don’t even remember asking for them.

“I didn’t order-” I started quietly, but the handlebar-mustached bartender cut me off.

“Eat, girl. You two look like hell.”

When I asked how much he wanted for them, he just grunted and walked off, busying himself and ignoring my question. I looked over at Felix for help and only got a sheepish smile and a pat on the shoulder.

I looked down at the sandwich and accepted my fate as I started to peel the crusts off by hand. I looked down at my feet to see Busch still snoring away softly. I bent down and offered him some of the crusts. I felt a warm breath against my hand as he sniffed it. Without opening his eyes, he gently took it from my hand and chomped away. I smiled softly as I fed him the rest of the peeled crusts. I took a few bites and let myself sink a little further into that bar stool.

Just as I was beginning to relax, I heard a sound I normally paid hardly any attention to, but this time it made my spine tense like a bear trap snapping shut. The sound of rotors cutting through the temperate summer air. Through the windows, I saw the shape of a helicopter flying low, sweeping the treeline. Its spotlight searched for any movement in the brush. The strobes flashed dimly as the red and green directional lights glowed steadily. The windows of the bar began to shake as its engines shrilled, drowning out any sounds of warmth.

The dark form of the bar dog raised his head and stared out at that chopper. He didn’t make a sound as he watched it comb the treelines. His ears perked and his eyes focused. The chopper finally turned, and that’s when I saw a dim blue light illuminating a golden star and dim black writing that read “Montana Highway Patrol.” It started to gain altitude as it passed over the bar with a shriek. The rumbling of the spinning blades shook my very core.

In the distant interstate, I could see the red and blue lights flashing wildly as the shapes of emergency vehicles tore down the highway toward the woods. The howling of the sirens echoed in the distance. I felt a hand grab my shoulder gently, but I couldn’t look away.

I didn’t say much after that. I finished my drink and noticed Felix had already paid the tab before I could react. We just exchanged a look and knew we both wanted to leave. We bid a muffled farewell to Norm as we exited the bar. The streets of Ravenwood still carried the distant, shrill calls of the sirens deep within the woods.

Felix offered to drive me home. I didn’t exactly have any reason to say no to him. I wish I could say something else happened on the drive back, but nothing did. I just remember staring out at nothing in particular as we passed the shadowy forms of closed storefronts and isolated houses.

When we finally pulled into the small collection of staff cabins, he turned to me as he was about to make his farewell, but I stopped him as I could feel my hands starting to shake again.

“Can you stay… just till morning-”

Felix looked at me in surprise for a moment before softening his expression.

“You sure?”

I nodded, and he let out an exhale.

“Alright, I’ll crash on the couch.”

I smiled a little, feeling a little safer knowing I wouldn’t be alone tonight despite his hesitation to stay.

As we both went inside the little cabin, I took in the familiar scent of cheap wood as I tried to make myself at home.

A cabin was a strong word. It wasn’t like the polished cabins you saw on the lake with handmade wooden furniture marketed as a romantic getaway for couples. It was basically a shack with a tiny kitchen, stuffed with furniture from the 70s that the feds bought for cheap, and a cot with a blue mattress that looked like it had been dragged from Camp Pendleton.

Felix settled on the ugly yellow-and-green plaid couch that I internally gagged at every time I set my eyes on it. I took a short shower that somewhat dampened the smell of ammonia lingering on my skin before getting ready for bed, changing into some comfy shorts and a loose-fitting tank top, and finally letting my hair down. The rancid smell was now replaced by the stale air and musty upholstery.

I looked over at Felix as he lounged in his makeshift sleeping spot on the sofa, eyeing the CRT adorned with bunny ears. His eyes flickered to me as I stood there in my pajamas.

“Heading to bed?”

“Yeah… Felix, I-”

The experienced ranger sat up to fully regard me, as he could infer I was about to say something that I had been wanting to say for a while.

“Thank you… for everything tonight. If you hadn’t been there, I probably wouldn’t be-”

He stopped me from continuing, already knowing where I was going with this.

“Ashley, there’s nothing good that will come from thinking about what could have happened.”

“I know…” I said, letting out a deep sigh.

“I’ll be here, okay? Just try to get some sleep, hun.”

“Right…night, Felix.”

“Night, Ash.”

I padded off to the little bedroom they had and tried to get comfortable in bed. The dark green wool blanket from the surplus store smelled like mothballs and not much else, but somehow…it didn’t make me itchy like it usually did.

I lay there for what felt like hours. My eyes just tried to drift away into sleep after this hellish day, but despite my best efforts, my fatigue wouldn’t take me. I couldn’t stop thinking about that thing in the woods. Its endless teeth as it opened its horrific jaws, the way it thrashed and twitched after Felix shot it, the smell that clung to my uniform and my skin. I sat up, rubbing my face, the images of what I saw not leaving my head.

Giving up on sleep entirely, I climbed out of bed and wandered into the dimly lit common area. Felix still sat on the couch wrapped up in a fleece blanket, as the washy colors from the Philips washed over his exhausted face. The CRT quietly murmured a late-night rerun of Are You Being Served? I padded over and sat close by him as the sitcom whispered a canned laugh track.

“Can’t sleep?” he said without looking at me.

I shook my head, and he smiled almost sadly.

“Yeah, me neither,” he said with a heavy sigh.

I didn’t say anything, but without thinking I found myself leaning on him as I felt myself start to shiver, but not from the cold. As the actors on screen, marinated in hairspray, rattled out British culture references and jokes from the 70s I didn’t understand, I felt the blanket being draped around me, just like I did for Jess. The fridge buzzing in the background became the only backdrop besides the TV set.

I don’t know when I fell asleep on Felix’s shoulder, but whatever small comfort he brought seemed to be enough to lull me into a surprisingly restful slumber. If I had any nightmares that night, they burned away from my memory as soon as the sun rose above the horizon.

When the morning finally washed over us, I found myself making a breakfast from back home that brought a little comfort to me: Rancheros huevos. Despite Felix looking at it strangely, he ate it without protest and said it reminded him of Indian tacos. Though I wasn’t sure what that even was, it was just nice to cook for someone again.

After breakfast, Felix drove me back to the station to pick up my car. Before we parted ways, I embraced him. It felt like hours, but in reality it was probably only a couple seconds. He told me to stay out of trouble, but I couldn’t let him see my eyes when I said I would.

Instead of just leaving in my car to wallow in what happened last night, I found myself drawn to the swinging glass doors of that shabby ranger station. Every part of me just told me to leave it to the pros. I’m just a college girl who works seasonal here. What good could I possibly do after what happened? Despite all these doubts circling like a tornado, my legs marched toward those double doors. But…I know I could never forgive myself if I left.

Despite how much busier the station was than usual, I slipped past most of the rangers without any of them even asking where I was going. Phones seemed to be ringing on end as badged rangers with rifles over their shoulders hauled heavy trunks of gear in and out of the station like worker ants. I stopped in front of Jake’s office, realizing this was my last chance to turn back.

I rested my knuckles on the polished wooden door before rapping three times on it. I heard a tired murmur to enter. The scent of cheap tobacco hit me as soon as I entered the cluttered office. Jake sat behind his desk, eyes bloodshot as he cradled a landline across his neck. He lazily blew out plumes of smoke through the half-cracked window at his side. His eyes flickered to me as he gestured to the chair in front of his desk, bidding me to sit. He clenched his jaw as he listened to what was said on the other end. He let out a deep sigh before muttering a “thank you” into the receiver and hanging up.

His hand rubbed his face as he attempted to smooth over his disheveled hair. My eyes flickered to the mug bearing the arrow-like mark of the forestry service. Many rings of stale coffee colored the inside, as a few drops of tar that had long since gone cold lingered at the bottom.

We both drove into the shadowed trail, the last remnants of daylight fading behind the pines. Stephanie led the way, her high-vis vest and gear catching the dim moonlight as she moved with quiet precision. The forest was almost too still, the usual hum of insects and distant birds gone. I felt a creeping tension build in my chest, my stomach twisting with anticipation.

Suddenly, the sharp scent of ammonia hit me again. My breath hitched, and I tried to warn her.

“Steph, I can-” I began, but she cut me off in a measured, tight voice.

“Keep walking,” she said.

The smell intensified as we continued, burning my nostrils. Nausea began to rise, my legs trembling. Then, a sharp sound; branches snapping, but heavier than anything we’d expect from the forest floor. Limbs from higher up, strong and deliberate.

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught movement. I turned, and regret hit immediately. Before I could react, Stephanie’s hand clamped over my mouth. Her eyes, steel-hard and unblinking, fixed on something in the treeline.

I followed her gaze, reluctantly. There it was, a nightmare made flesh. Skittering between the trees with an unnatural gait, its body composed of borrowed limbs and heads of creatures I knew too well. Spider-like in form, towering over the young firs.

Stephanie slowly released her hand, still staring at the abomination.

“Don’t run now, hun. It’ll chase you faster than a grizzly with cubs,” she whispered gravely.

My heart pounded so loudly it nearly drowned out the forest. My shaking hand went toward my holster, but Stephanie’s firm squeeze stopped me.

“Don’t- that little peashooter will just piss it off,” she murmured.

I glanced at the rifle in her hands, knees weakening.

“What do we do… can’t you just shoot it?” I whispered shakily. She tilted her head slightly toward me and let out a soft, almost amused giggle.

“Oh bless your heart… this .308 wouldn’t put something down this big. Speaking of—” She suddenly handed the rifle to me.

“W-what? What are you doing…?” I stammered, helpless, as the creature’s wolf-like head twisted unnaturally to watch us, gums pulled back in a snarl.

“Just trust me, Ashley. Stay real still now,” she said, her voice firm. She reached across her belt, drew a bulky metallic flare pistol not a little orange plastic one like in a regular emergency kit, but the type found on a Coast Guard cutter and loaded a shell with a soft thump.

The thing’s heads locked onto us with pure white eyes, opening their maws in unison. The sound was a horrifying symphony: a wolf’s howl, a raven’s caw, the shrill scream of a mountain lioness, the bellow of a bull elk, and the mournful call of a loon across a lake. It pounded in my chest, echoing through my skull.

The flare pistol clicked as the hammer pulled back, deafening in its sudden intensity. Stephanie exhaled sharply and raised it.

The abomination charged, strafing between trees. Its disproportioned limbs clawed at the soil and bark for leverage.

A loud crack rang out, and I flinched. Smoke trailed in the air as the flare slammed into the creature with a fleshy thud. A muted pop followed, and then a savage hiss as it ignited. The forest filled with the smell of burning fur and gunpowder.

The flare burned like a miniature sun as the creature screamed and thrashed, its limbs scrabbling through the dirt as it fled, the signal round still searing against its flesh. Its cries faded into echoes as the trees swallowed its form. My heart and ears still rang from the intensity of it all.

Stephanie stood still for a moment, then retrieved the rifle from my grasp. Her hand gently guided me back toward camp, words unnecessary. The sun set further behind the horizon, twilight swallowing the trail.

Ahead, patrol cars formed a line, their lightbars fused into a makeshift barrier. A state trooper stood in front with a shotgun across his chest, campaign hat silhouetted against the glow. Families in cars reluctantly turned around, following his wide gestures with a Maglite. Other troopers lingered, spotlights sweeping the treeline.

Stephanie and I exchanged a glance. She sighed, exhausted.

“C’mon, ain’t no use staring. Let’s get you something to eat back at camp,” she said, her voice carrying an uncharacteristic tightness.

Back at camp, we settled around a small fire. Stephanie rested in a folding chair, her hat on her knee. Her silver-streaked bun loosened, and she brought a cigarette to her lips, only for it to tumble from her shaking fingers. She cursed softly and clenched her fist. I didn’t comment and instead heated some ramen over a sterno.

I finally spoke up, voice shaking.

“How…How can you be so calm about this?”

Stephanie’s silver eyes met mine as she lit her retrieved Zippo.

“You get used to it,” she said dismissively.

“That’s it? You just get used to it?” I asked incredulously.

“Well…Before all this happened, us badged folks didn’t exactly do what y’all seasonals do and go home. You ever been up to Yellowstone?”

“Maybe once, I think?” I replied, raising an eyebrow.

“You know those thermal pools?” she asked. I nodded.

“Back in ’81, when I was a pretty young thing like you… a couple went off-trail near the pools to find somewhere to skinny dip. You know…”

“Yeah…” I sighed, rubbing my neck.

“Well, the boyfriend got close to test the water and fell right in. Didn’t even scream much. But she sure did when she ran to get us.”

“Was he-”

“Dead? I wish that was all he was,” she said softly, a hollow smile on her sun-tanned face.

“Jesus…” I muttered.

“By the time we got there? The pool was sludge, reeking like pennies. Nothing to pull out besides a few clumps of hair and ripped cloth… and that smell.”

“They must have closed the park…” I mused aloud, staring at the floating block of instant noodles in my mess cup.

Stephanie grinned like a shark, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

“Think so? Nah, all they did was add another sign and…That was that. Family tried to sue, but it got dismissed.”

“That’s…Awful,” I said, unsure what else to say.

Stephanie nodded before continuing.

“Sure, but it’s just another thing to deal with. Just like the chimera, the bears, and the tourists.”

“The chimera?” I asked, finally looking up.

“That’s what we call it. Like that old Greek story. That thing’s been prowling since last April. First it took a hunter in his deer stand, then a hiker here and there. Those drunk kids are probably next. At this point, they’re probably all dead,” she stated flatly, with clear confidence in her words.

“How can this happen? Why don’t they…Shut down the park?”

Stephanie finally softened, meeting my gaze.

“I wonder that too, most nights.”

I didn’t respond, staring at the campfire crackling in the night. She let out a plume of smoke before sagging her shoulders.

“Ash, honey, you should get some rest. You had a long day,” she added gently.

I managed a smile and muffled “goodnight” before plopping onto one of the foldable cots. For some reason, I was actually able to sleep better tonight. I wasn’t sure why, but I didn’t care. I wished I could say that would be my worst night.",1,1767300876.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1q1erzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1q1erzr/new_sugery_drinks_snap_law/,New sugery drinks SNAP law,"Have you heard about the new sugary drinks and beverages law set to take effect in March? Under this change, sodas and energy drinks will no longer be eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. At first glance, that sounds reasonable. Most of us can agree that soda and energy drinks aren’t exactly health foods, and I’d even argue they fall more into the “luxury” category than a basic drink option.
But once you dig into the details, it goes much further than that.
This isn’t just about soda and energy drinks—it applies to all beverages with added sugar. That includes the majority of juices, as well as many coffees and teas. In practice, SNAP recipients will be limited to water, seltzer, milk (including flavored milk), and a narrow category of juice. Even then, the juice must be at least 50% juice and contain no added sugars—which automatically disqualifies most juices people actually buy.
That’s where my concern starts.
I’m not sure what this level of restriction is really trying to accomplish. SNAP serves many families with children, and limiting drink options to only water, milk, or 100% juice feels extremely restrictive in the real world. Realistically, most kids are going to reach for the 100% juice every time.
A lot of people hear “100% juice” and think, That’s healthy—what’s the problem? But that assumption doesn’t hold up. When I was younger, I cut out soda and high-fructose corn syrup, convinced I was making a healthier choice. For about a year, I drank only water, tea, and 100% juice. The result? Constant digestive problems. For the entire year I couldn't find a solid on the toilet if my life depended on it. 
That’s when I learned that “100% juice” doesn’t automatically mean it’s a better option—especially large or frequent amounts. It’s still a heavy sugar load, just without the word “added” attached to it.
My worry is that this policy will push kids toward drinking 100% juice most of the time, if not all the time, simply because it’s one of the only remaining options. And that could easily lead to widespread digestive issues and other health problems—ironically undermining the very health goals this policy claims to support.

So, I have been dating this cute girl for 7 months now and since she's a devout Muslim she doesn't believe in sex before marriage or any casual stuff during the relationship. However, I'm not a teenage virgin guy who'd be okay with no intimacy and I have been with women physically. I like this one so much that I forget about sex around her and just like to spend the time. But she's a gorgeous hijabi and an attractive girl so it's natural to wanna express some emotions. One day when we were in a long drive, I made a move and we ended up engaging in a long make out sesh. She was really into it but felt guilty afterwards. She loves the idea of intimacy with me and sometimes we even discuss how it would be in texts. 

She's got her beliefs but it had been becoming difficult for me to manage so I tried to persuade her into expressing ourselves physically. She refused. I understand and respect her thoughts but also felt bad as I don't wanna go to anyone else for my intimate needs. She sensed my dejection the last few days even though I was totally happy just hanging out with her. 

On NY eve she asked me that we should meet so we decided that I'll pick her up as usual and we'll go for some coffee and a drive. In the morning she said we should change the plans and that I should meet her at her place as her parents are away for a wedding and she would cook biryani just for us. It was so sweet, I agreed coz she does cook well. I went to her flat without being seen by any neighbor and sneaked into the place. We hugged, she gave me a lil kiss. And this was the first time I was seeing her without a hijab outside of pictures irl. She asked me to sit, I was nervous. Then went inside her room, locked it, and asked me wait. She then called me in, I went in, and to my fucking surprise she laid there in just a cute bra and nothing underneath but just a big gift bow on the crown of her smooth and freshly groomed lady parts 😭😭😭😭😭 

I was shocked and ecstatic and asked her what is all this. She said that she understands my loyalty and would want me to come down and eat her present 🎁 ...I'm typing this from her bedroom as she sleeps, and I've been here since 11am, so you can understand what happened 👀 ..this was too awesome to not share and since I can't on insta or anywhere else, reddit feels like the right place.",0,1767300757.0,LahoreSocial,7,0.1,False

For context, we work in different departments at the same company. It all seemed to start after a cross-department presentation we did together. We got to know each other a bit better, and after that her behavior around me noticeably changed.

At first, I noticed that when we were talking in a group, she’d suddenly seem more animated or excited but shortly after, she stopped speaking to me when others were around. From then on, she’d only talk to me when she knew I was alone, and she’d message me for a coffee while we were both in the office (always her initiating, and only when I was by myself).

At one point she complimented my looks, which caught me off guard. The way she looked at me felt… different, like it gave something away. She also became slightly more touchy, once briefly touching my chest before quickly pulling her hand back, like she realized she’d crossed a line. I didn’t react, just pretended not to notice. Soon on, I asked her for a lunch which she enthusiastically accepted and it went great.

Whenever we see each other, she gives me this specific smile, almost like she lights up, but I’m aware that could just be my interpretation.

More recently, she asked to catch up again. During that conversation, she seemed extremely nervous: fidgeting, smiling, looking away. I picked up on the tension and ended up feeling nervous myself, and I may have let that show a bit.

Then, on a recent office day, I was very busy and noticed her from across the room. All day she kept facing forward and never looked toward the back of the room. Toward the end of the day, I walked past her to answer a call. After I sat back down, I noticed that she looked back twice for the first time all day (once while turning to the side and the second while doing a full 360 turn to see behind) and even walked back to my area and glanced directly at me. I felt like she wanted to initiate contact, but I was clearly busy with headphones on so couldn't speak.

At that point, I got a strong sense that she might like me. Since I’m leaving the company in a couple of months, I decided it made more sense to initiate contact instead of just being reactive. When we next interacted, she seemed much more relaxed, happy, smiling almost constantly, but also very jumpy, giddy, and excited. That contrast confused me, especially since she’d been so nervous the last time.

These two bags are Costco's Kirkland store brand, 6 lbs total (2.72 kg), purchased in-store for a total of $42.50. 

It's whole bean coffee: Costco makes grinders available in store at no extra charge. These beans will be ground at home and brewed in an IKEA French press. No milk or sugar, but I do like a pinch of spice: nutmeg, ginger, allspice, or cinnamon. Sometimes it also gets a few drops of orange extract. The extra flavors are purchased in bulk and aren't in need of replacement. To give this a round number, will err on the high side and estimate those extras add $7.50 to the cost.

For the next however long this lasts, all the coffee I drink will be from these two bags. Basically, have as much as I want--but bring a travel cup when leaving home. Carry a Thermos for day drips.

I one time tapped to pay in a mall coffee shop not even in Manila/Taguig. So thats the only risk point I can think of.

Anyways...already flagged to my CC and getting a new CC card.  Just confirmation again to not use CC in PH and I was curious if anyone else has had random charges from ""Dito Telecommunity Corp""?

# Key Takeaways

 

* **Paying it Forward is an Investment:** Paying it forward isn't just about buying coffee; it's an investment in others that pays dividends by setting them up for success and safety.
* **Proactive Safety Measures:** Practical acts like salting walkways or ensuring cars have fuel and emergency gear help others avoid failure and stay safe during winter travel.
* **Mental Well-Being Check-ins:** The holidays bring hidden stressors (financial, family, travel). Asking coworkers ""Are you okay?"" or ""I got you"" can uncover these ""X factors"" and provide much-needed support.
* **The ""Glass House"" of Leadership:** Effective leadership involves ""paying it forward"" by mentoring the next generation, a concept exemplified by industry veterans who continue to teach safety even after retirement.
* **Distracted Driving Dangers:** The first snow of the season often catches drivers off guard. Preparing for winter conditions is a critical way to pay it forward to your family and fellow commuters.

So, I have been dating this cute girl for 7 months now and since she's a devout Muslim she doesn't believe in sex before marriage or any casual stuff during the relationship. However, I'm not a teenage virgin guy who'd be okay with no intimacy and I have been with women physically. I like this one so much that I forget about sex around her and just like to spend the time. But she's a gorgeous hijabi and an attractive girl so it's natural to wanna express some emotions. One day when we were in a long drive, I made a move and we ended up engaging in a long make out sesh. She was really into it but felt guilty afterwards. She loves the idea of intimacy with me and sometimes we even discuss how it would be in texts. 

She's got her beliefs but it had been becoming difficult for me to manage so I tried to persuade her into expressing ourselves physically. She refused. I understand and respect her thoughts but also felt bad as I don't wanna go to anyone else for my intimate needs. She sensed my dejection the last few days even though I was totally happy just hanging out with her. 

On NY eve she asked me that we should meet so we decided that I'll pick her up as usual and we'll go for some coffee and a drive. In the morning she said we should change the plans and that I should meet her at her place as her parents are away for a wedding and she would cook biryani just for us. It was so sweet, I agreed coz she does cook well. I went to her flat without being seen by any neighbor and sneaked into the place. We hugged, she gave me a lil kiss. And this was the first time I was seeing her without a hijab outside of pictures irl. She asked me to sit, I was nervous. Then went inside her room, locked it, and asked me wait. She then called me in, I went in, and to my fucking surprise she laid there in just a cute bra and nothing underneath but just a big gift bow on the crown of her smooth and freshly groomed lady parts 😭😭😭😭😭 

I was shocked and ecstatic and asked her what is all this. She said that she understands my loyalty and would want me to come down and eat her present 🎁 ...I'm typing this from her bedroom as she sleeps, and I've been here since 11am, so you can understand what happened 👀 ..this was too awesome to not share and since I can't on insta or anywhere else, reddit feels like the right place.",0,1767300298.0,IslamabadSocial,22,0.29,False

I brush twice a day with a gentle electric brush and floss regularly. I have whitening strips but don’t use them much because I’m worried about enamel. I drink tea and coffee but do my best to swish with water after I drink.

1q1eee1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q1eee1/the_meat_locker_behind_the_church/,The Meat Locker Behind The Church,"Chapter One

There are towns that teach you how to disappear without ever leaving.

Casper Creek was one of them.

It sat low in the land, fields sagging toward it from every direction, the roads bending inward like they did not want to go anywhere else. Corn grew tall but thin, the stalks brittle by August. Soybeans yellowed early. People said the soil was tired, like it had given all it could and was still being asked for more.

My grandmother used to say the land listened.

“Treat it right,” she would tell me, scraping grease into a coffee can by the sink, “and it will keep you.”

Nothing wasted. Nothing forgotten. 

That was Casper Creek’s religion long before the church ever put words to it.

People here shared because they had to. When a man lost his job at the elevator, groceries appeared on his porch. When a woman buried her husband, casseroles lined her counters until there was nowhere left to sit. And when the winter came hard, and it always did, there was meat.

Wrapped in butcher paper. Tied with twine. No return address. Nothing fancy.

It came from the meat locker behind the church.

The freezer sat half buried in the ground like a concrete tick, feeding on the earth. The door screamed when it opened, a long metal wail that carried across the gravel lot. You could hear it from the sanctuary during service if someone went out back, and no one ever looked toward the sound.

You were not supposed to.

I grew up knowing the locker the same way I knew the cemetery, present, useful, not to be lingered on. My grandmother never explained it. She did not have to. She would just say, “Go on, grab a package. The Lord provides.”

And I believed her.

When she died, the town provided back.

That should have frightened me more than it did.

Chapter Two

Grandma Ruth’s house had been shrinking for years.

Not physically, not really, but in the way unused rooms closed in on themselves, doors left shut, furniture collecting dust like it was being slowly buried. By the time she died, she lived between the kitchen, the bathroom, and the chair by the window that faced the fields.

That is where I found her.

Hands folded. Mouth slightly open. The radio playing low, gospel bleeding into static. Outside, the corn rattled in the wind like dry bones.

The doctor said it was her heart. Clean. Quick. A strange mercy of sorts.

The town said she had lived a good life.

I stayed after the funeral to clean. It felt wrong to leave her house to strangers, even though the town insisted they would help. I wanted to see what she had left behind. I wanted proof she had actually been here.

The basement was cool and smelled of dirt and vinegar. Shelves lined the walls, sagging slightly under the weight of glass jars. Beans. Tomatoes. Beets. Everything labeled in her careful script.

Dates mattered to her. Names mattered.

I noticed then how many jars were marked For Church.

In the kitchen, I found butcher paper folded and refolded until it was thin as cloth. Twine wound neatly on a nail. marker by the sink, its tip stained dark.

There was a stain on the counter I did not remember. A rust colored shadow that would not come up no matter how hard I scrubbed.

That night, I dreamed of her standing at the sink, humming, hands red to the wrists.

The next Sunday, Pastor Lowell found me after service.

“Your grandmother used to help with inventory,” he said. “We would appreciate it if you could take over.”

His smile was kind, practiced.

I said yes.

Chapter Three

The donation freezer was louder than I remembered.

The scream of the door set my teeth on edge, echoing off the church walls and into the empty fields beyond. Cold spilled out, thick and damp, carrying the faint smell of iron beneath it.

Inside, the shelves were full.

Not messy. Not rushed.

Careful. 

Every package was wrapped tight in butcher paper, the corners folded precise, twine cinched so snug it cut into the flesh beneath. Names were written across each one in marker, black ink stark against white paper.

I tried not to read them.

I failed.

Ruth H. Miller sat on the bottom shelf, paper darkened with moisture. Pink liquid seeped from one corner, dripping slow onto the concrete floor.

I knelt without meaning to.

The handwriting was hers. I knew it the way you know a voice in the dark.

I reached for another package, hands numb. The paper was stiff with frost. Beneath it, something shifted, just slightly, settling into place.

The door closed behind me.

Pastor Lowell’s reflection wavered in the metal shelves.

“She believed in giving back,” he said softly. “Your grandmother.”

My breath fogged the air. My heart beat too loud in my ears.

“Giving back what?” I asked.

He did not answer right away.

From somewhere deep in the freezer, there came a dull, hollow thump. Not a bang. Not a cry.

Just a reminder.

Pastor Lowell met my eyes.  

“Enough,” he said.

Chapter Four

Pastor Lowell did not touch the packages.

He stood just inside the freezer door, hands folded at his waist, coat buttoned despite the cold. He watched me the way you watch a child learning something unpleasant but necessary.

“We will go shelf by shelf,” he said. “You just mark the names. I will handle the rest.”

“The rest of what,” I asked.

He smiled again, that same careful smile. “Distribution.”

I nodded because my body seemed to know this was expected of it. My hands moved before my thoughts could catch up.

The clipboard was cold. The pen skipped when I tried to write.

Names filled the shelves. Some I recognized. Some I did not. Old families, newer ones, people who had moved away, people who had not been spoken of in years. A few were written in shaky script, as if the hand that labeled them had been tired or afraid.

One package near the top shelf had no name at all. Just a date.

I pointed at it. “What about that one.”

Pastor Lowell did not look where I pointed. “That was an emergency,” he said. “We did not have time.”

Time for what went unsaid.

As I wrote, I noticed patterns. Dates clustered around hard winters. After the flood. After the factory closed. After the year the crops failed so badly people fed deer apples from their own trees.

“Does everyone know,” I asked, my voice thin in the cold.

He considered this. “Everyone knows enough.”

Another sound came from the back of the freezer. A soft scrape, like something shifting against concrete.

I did not look. 

When we were done, Pastor Lowell took the clipboard and nodded once. “You did well,” he said. “Your grandmother always did.”

The door screamed open again, and the cold loosened its grip. I did not breathe right until we were back outside.

The church bell rang then, slow and steady.

Dinner time.

Chapter Five

That night, I stood in my kitchen staring at the stove.

A package lay on the counter. No name on this one. Just twine and paper, folded with care. It had been left on my porch sometime after I got home. No knock. No note.

The smell came through the paper, faint but unmistakable.

Meat. 

I told myself it was venison. I told myself it was pork. I told myself a lot of things while my hands moved on their own, unwrapping, rinsing, seasoning the way I had watched my grandmother do a hundred times.

I did not look too closely.

When it cooked, the smell filled the house, rich and warm and comforting in a way that made my throat ache. My stomach growled, traitorous.

I ate slowly.

It tasted like nothing special. It tasted like survival.

That night, I dreamed of the town as it had been before I was born. Smaller. Hungrier. People with hollow faces and careful eyes. I saw them gather behind the church, hands clasped, breath steaming in the cold.

Someone stepped forward.

I woke with my jaw aching, like I had been chewing something tough.

The next morning, I noticed the ache in my arm again, just below the elbow. Faint bruising bloomed there, yellow and purple, like fingers had pressed too hard.

At the store, people smiled at me more than usual. Mrs. Calder from the bank touched my sleeve and said, “Your grandmother would be proud.”

At the church bulletin board, a notice had been posted.

VOLUNTEERS NEEDED

WINTER PREPARATION

I did not take one of the slips.

Not yet.

That night, I stood at my grandmother’s sink and washed my hands until the water ran cold. That damned rust colored stain on the counter seemed darker than before.

I thought of her careful handwriting. Her labels. Her jars.

Nothing wasted. Nothing forgotten.

Outside, the fields rustled softly, like they were listening.

Chapter Six

I thought I was doing the right thing.

I carried the package into the town hall, past the courthouse steps slick with mud, past the bare trees shaking in the cold wind. Inside, the hall smelled of varnish, old wood, and the faint copper tang of iron that set my stomach roiling. The chairs were stacked along the walls, and the podium gleamed under the harsh yellow lights.

People turned as I entered. Eyes narrowed. Faces I knew stared at me with suspicion. Whispers curled through the room like thick smoke.

“Mayor,” I said, raising the package. “You have to see this. Behind the church…what’s happening; is…”

A laugh cut me off, high and sharp, like a knife scraping glass. It stopped abruptly when Pastor Lowell stepped into the doorway, calm and deliberate. He was taller than I remembered, his coat hanging straight, his hands folded in front of him. His eyes, dark and still, roamed the room and settled on me.

“Thomas,” he said softly. “You do not understand.”

“I understand perfectly,” I said, my voice trembling. “The freezer, the packages…they’re not food. They’re…”

“You dare speak here of lies?” someone shouted. A woman pointed, a finger trembling. “He’s the devil!”

Others joined in, murmurs swelling to shouts. “Sacrilege!” “Blasphemer!”

Pastor Lowell’s lips curved faintly. “You see, they cannot be saved if they speak against the work. Thomas, you were warned.”

The crowd surged forward. Knives, sticks, bats, and whatever they could grasp appeared in their hands. I froze. Every face I recognized was twisted in rage. Every friend, every neighbor, every familiar voice shouted for my blood.

“I… I’m telling the truth,” I said. “Pastor Lowell, he-he’s the one doing this!”

“He is saving us!” someone shouted. “You are the devil!”

The package slipped from my hands and split open. Its contents pooled across the floor, dark and coppery. I did not look closely. My stomach churned, my hands shook, my breath came in ragged bursts.

Pastor Lowell stepped toward me, his face calm, almost expectant. “Do not resist,” he said, voice soft, almost hypnotic. “This is how it must be.”

The crowd did not wait.

Chapter Seven

I ran.

Through mud and frost, into the tall cornfields beyond the hall. The stalks pressed against me, brushing my face, tripping my legs. The shouts grew behind me, every footstep heavy with intent. I could hear the scrape of sticks on the ground, the thud of boots in the wet earth.

Pastor Lowell’s voice echoed after me, but not to stop them; it carried instruction. “Hold him! Don’t let him escape!”

Everywhere I looked, faces emerged from the corn, lit by the dying sun. Angry, silent, determined. They had grown up with his words. They had learned obedience, and now their devotion was a weapon.

A figure lunged. I fell, mud in my eyes, hands raw on the frozen earth. A pipe swung over my back, missed by inches. A knife cut the sleeve of my coat. I scrambled, digging my fingers into the dirt, pulling myself upright.

Through the corn, I saw him. Pastor Lowell, standing on the edge of the field, calm, still, hands lifted slightly, as if conducting the madness around him. A faint smile curved his lips. He did not intervene. He never intervened.

I ran, unseeing, slipping into a ditch, the screams fading into the rustle of the stalks. The wind carried them to me, the prayers, the curses, the chants. I was alone.

The package lay open behind me, its contents forgotten in the mud. My hands were slick with something that did not feel like blood or meat, though I could not tell. My chest heaved, my head spun, and yet I kept running, knowing the town would not stop, knowing Pastor Lowell

had planned it this way all along.

I emerged from the corn at the edge of the river. The water was black and cold. My boots sank in the mud. Behind me, I heard them coming again. 

I knew I could not outrun them.

And then I understood.

1q1edsf,https://i.redd.it/cmw2nooqtsag1.jpeg,Review: Appleton Estate Hearts Collection 2003,"Here is a bottling from the renowned Appleton Estate in conjunction with Velier, a collaboration between Master Blender Joy Spence and Independent Bottler Luca Gargano. What sets these bottles apart from Appleton's usual lineup is the use of 100% pot still rum chosen from a huge array of barrels in Appleton's warehouse (20 barrels for this particular release), and bottled at cask strength. This particular bottle was first distilled in 2003, aged for 18 years and bottled in 2021.

Country of Origin: Jamaica

ABV: 63%

Age: 18 years tropically

*Tasting Notes*

Nose: Floral, rubber, orange peel, almond, ripe banana, vanilla, chocolate

Mouth: Spicy, coffee, tobacco, rubber, butterscotch, chocolate, ripe banana

Finish: Very strong initial burn which eases with each sip. The flavour diminishes a little early, but the heat maintains for a lengthy finish.

When I first opened this bottle, I found it quite underwhelming. I recall it having a weaker than expected nose and quite a burning palate, and just very difficult to discern notes. Now that I've had a bit more time with it, it has definitely opened up a lot more. 

However, as high-end Jamaican rums go, I'm not entirely convinced. I guess Appleton just does not impress me as much as I'd like; I don't feel as much excitement from it. In saying that, this is still a quality bottle. It has some lovely character and is very enjoyable. I just don't feel that it's worth the price of admission.

I am planning a startup idea and I would like some honest feedback

•	European-style interior (minimal, cozy, warm lighting)

	•	Indian-style coffee and snacks (filter coffee, masala options)

	•	Comfortable seating for long conversations

	•	A peaceful, stress-free environment (not loud like fast-food cafés)

My questions:

	1.	Is this concept attractive in today’s market?

	2.	What mistakes should I avoid while starting a café?

	3.	How important is location compared to interior design?

	4.	Any ideas to stand out from big brands like Starbucks?

I am planning this café in India, in a mid-sized city.

1q1ed91,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q1ed91/aitah_for_accepting_name_brand_gifts_from_family/,AITAH for accepting name brand gifts from family that I never wanted?,"This all started nine years ago. For Christmas my SIL gave me (34 at the time) a gorgeous Coach purse. I was very effusive in my thanks because I realized what an expense it was. (They are very wealthy and give gifts like that to everyone.) I made an offhand comment that I had never had anything name brand and I could not wait to show it off. This comment now haunts me because my family interpreted that to mean name brand gifts are the perfect type of gift for me.

Here's the thing - I am not the type to wear name brand items out and about because I work in landscaping. If I hang out with friends, we are usually in sweats hanging out on the couch. Even going to events, I would be too nervous to take anything expensive because I would lose it or ruin it, and just be uncomfortable having it.

But since I made such a big deal about the purse, my family started buying me name brand gifts and I did not know how to backtrack it. Even when I would say things like, ""Oh this is too much! You shouldn't have!"" They thought I didn't mean it. Between Christmas and birthdays I now have a collection of ridiculously expensive items I never use - several Ray Ban sunglasses, Gucci boots, Burberry trench coats, etc - all of which  wouldn't survive one landscape job. They just live in my closet because it feels rude to sell them but I also could not figure out how to tell everyone to stop buying these things for me without seeming ungrateful.

This all came to a head because this Christmas we decided to draw names for gift giving among the adults. I found out through the grape vine that my oldest niece drew me and was thinking of buying me diamond earrings but was worried I wouldn't be happy because she could only afford the stud earrings. She just graduated college and got married, I know finances are tight for her. I just couldn't let her waste money on that. I took her out for coffee and confessed that I heard about the earrings and to please not feel like she had to purchase something expensive on my behalf. I told her I would be perfectly happy with a gift card to my favorite coffee shop or nursery. She looked horrified and said everyone would think she cheaped out. I assured her that I would be more grateful for one of those items than the earrings because all the name brand items actually just made me nervous and I never used them. I suggested that I propose a spending limit to everyone so that it was equal all around. She reluctantly agreed.

The s*""t hit the fan when I suggested the limit. My siblings complained and my niece spilled the beans about our conversation. When I admitted that I did not actually use the expensive items people bought for me, they got mad and said that I allowed them to waste money on things that just sat in a closet. I apologized and offered everyone the items they got for me so they could sell them but was informed that that wasn't the point. I tried to explain how I had not been sure how to confess this without sounding ungrateful but everyone is still mad at me. Christmas was very cold this year and I am feeling blue. My partner feels like they overreacted since I never asked for any of these things - if they had ever asked me what I wanted I would have told them - and especially since I offered to give everything back. He is mad at them for bringing me down during the holidays but I still feel bad.

The idea is to have something compact I can bring with me during business trips: 3 to max 5 days. I always stay in hotels so, hot water and a kettle are always available (but almost never a gooseneck kettle.. this is important). 

My type of coffee is pour over style: I like the flavor of it and the idea of having something I can sip with me while at work / meetings (vs. an espresso I consume in a shot). 

Also, and this is going to ruffle some feathers, I'd like to bring with me pre-grounded coffee so that I don't have to bring coffee beans and grinds with me (yeah.. I would like to find the time for experiment some local beans depending where I go but.. this is for business related trips: very little time and lot of airport --> hotels --> working places).

So, the idea is:

* ground coffee (grounded at home) transported in plastic vials
* a WACACO Pipamoka (so that I can live without a gooseneck kettle)

Then the day before I travel, I grind my favorite coffee, fill the vials.. and I'm good.

How this setup looks like to you? Do you have suggestions on something better that would match the same portability / commodity and flavor texture?

What kind of case would you suggest that would fit the Pipamoka and the vials?

At certain points things were emotionally charged based on the nature of the workshop. There was a moment when we were all sitting around after dinner and she grabbed my hand. When things wrapped up, she sought me out, gave me an extra long hug and said something about being certain we would see each other again. A couple of weeks later we found each other on social media (no contact other than liking posts). A few weeks after that, we ""saw"" each other again on a reunion Zoom call for the event. She made a pointed comment to the group about wanting to stay in contact with a few of us. I took this as a hint and sent a message asking if she wanted to go out for coffee. 2 minutes later, she responded ""I would love that"" and included a heart emoji. She texted to check on my schedule and then proposed an evening event at a museum. I agreed. Is this a date?

Another day, another war.

This one was called the War of Nauun. The locals claimed it was a divine mandate. From my cloaked observation pod hanging in Taum's high atmosphere, it looked like a particularly vicious land dispute. My screen was a mess of heat signatures, red and orange blobs clashing and fading. I was supposed to be tagging tactical patterns for my report. My mind was on the coffee substitute brewing in the corner of my pod. It tasted like acidic mud (disgusting), but it was the only thing keeping me awake.

The \_Voyager 3 Delta\_ paid me to watch. Junior Cultural Analyst. It sounded important. It meant I was a professional voyeur. The Earth Colonial Authority called it ""non-invasive study."" I called it a paycheck. A small one. Not nearly enough to buy my way out of the corporate indentured service program that got me this gig in the first place.

A flicker on the screen that looked like a glitch. The wide-angle view of the battle field popped up in front of me, and my focus snapped against all protocols, onto a single heat signal. It was moving faster than the others, a white-hot needle different from the red dots stitching through the chaotic fields of the fight. The system auto-tagged it.

""Subject: Ygdrill. Clan: Graun. Status: Active Combatant.""

I sighed and went to reset the view but my hand stopped.

His fight looked different from the other wars I have seen. He was a storm of controlled violence. His bronze skin gleaming under the pale sun of Taum, covered in a history of tattoos I couldn't read.

On his chest, a big, thick lizard-thing with spines. It gave the illusion that it was wrapped around his sternum. A nasty scar cut right through its tail, the ink blurred around the old wound. Was that for killing one? Or did he get the scar, and then they inked the lizard over it?

On his shoulder, a mess of knots and blocks that looked like a diagram. Down his side, over his ribs: rows of marks. Simple. Five triangles. Eleven dots. Three jagged lines. A tally. Of what? Years served? Men killed? Missions? Right at the base of his throat, a small symbol. A twisted circle with a line through it. Like a keyhole. Or a sealed mouth.

From my limited knowledge I could tell they weren't decorations; they were a testament. A record of kills, of journeys, of survival. he also had metal rings glinting along the curve of his ear, in his eyebrow. He wielded a blade of dark, polished stone that should have been crude. But in his hands, it was like a katana, precise, smooth and sharp.

My job was to note tactical efficacy. So, I watched him. ***Closely***.

He moved with a calculated motion that was terrifying. A pivot, a feint, a strike. He didn't waste a single breath. A warrior from the northern clan lunged at him with a spear. Ygdrill didn't block. He flowed around the thrust, grabbed the shaft, and used the man's momentum to pull him onto the point of his own blade. It was so brutally efficient. He grinned then, a flash of white teeth in the dust and blood, and my heart did a stupid, fluttering thing against my ribs.

**BLARE-BLARE-BLARE**

A proximity alert blared.

One of my sensor drones was drifting into the kill zone. Protocol demanded an immediate recall. I'd have to justify this incident in a report. More paperwork.

I hit the override and pushed the drone closer. I needed a better visual. For the report(obviously).

The high-res feed sharpened. I could see the tension in his jaw, the absolute focus in his eyes. This wasn't rage. It was a kind of concentrated peace that looked like confidence. The console chimed again. Not an alert this time. An internal command.

""Lemon. Bio-metrics show elevated heart rate and pupil dilation. Are you observing a new weapon? Do you require backup?"" \_Evans.\_

My supervisor. Of course. The ECA monitored everything. Even my goddamn pupils. I typed a reply, my fingers cold and swift.

""Negative. No new weapons. Subject Ygdrill's combat patterns are highly dynamic. Stress response from focused analysis.""

*A lie.(obviously)*

""Acknowledged. Log the patterns. And Lemon... Prime Directive 7. Observe. Do not interfere. Do not become involved. Contamination is a terminal offense.""\_ Evans out \_

The screen went dark. **Terminal offense**. He just gave me a polite reminder to not get kicked off the ship. This kind of reminder used to irk me out when I first came here but now I have gotten used to it. The ECA has a habit of throwing terminal offense at every minor inconvenience. They also love to remind you about the rules like it's some sort of religious teaching. **Terminal offense** just means getting kicked off the new ship and sent to an old one, just to rot for the rest of your life.

I looked back at the viewport. The battle was over. The Graun had won. Ygdrill stood amidst the carnage, his dark blade planted in the soil with his chest heaving. He scanned the field, then his gaze lifted to the sky. It wasn't a look of victory. It was a search. His eyes narrowed, scanning the empty blue, and for a single second, I felt it—goosebumps formed on my arm. Like he was looking right through the stealth tech, right at me.

It was impossible. A trick of the light. My imagination.

But the feeling stuck.

\_Observe. Do not become involved.\_

My hands moved on their own. I isolated the last few minutes of footage, found the perfect frame. Ygdrill, standing tall, the tattoos on his body a story I suddenly wanted to write. The file name blinked.

I didn't save it to the official database.(*duh*)

I saved it to a private drive. ""Project\_Zero.jpg.""

I am not allowed to do anything without the ECA's approval. So keeping this picture is breaking the rule but I am not sure if this would be considered as *""Terminal Offense""*

On the screen, Ygdrill turned away, barking orders at his men.

Honestly as a ""cultural analyst"" I would like it if I could study more about the people and their life rather than watching them fight. A civilization is much more than wars but who is gonna tell that to ECA. I started looking through old and new reports about their culture maybe someone is or was in-charge of documenting their life. But surprisingly I found a few geographical maps with mineral deposit sites and nothing about their habitat, animals, plants, culture.

As if ECA conveniently forgot that this is a civilization. A world with it's own Eco system.

You maybe wondering *why* did I save the file.

He is kind, loving, generous, sweet and I love him very much. The thing is, he has severe autoimmune issues including VKH which has left him blind in one eye. A few months after we started dating, he developed Psoriatic Arthritis which is severe. He is on a high dose of methotrexate and Rinvoq and yet he is immense pain daily (6/10 on the pain scale). His back is the worst, I haven't been able to hug him in 1 month because any touch is agonising and this has been devastating for me. He isn't able to stand for prolonged periods, he can't walk for longer than 10mins at a time before he needs to rest. Our dates consist of going for coffee and sitting in the car, which I find unsatisfying as I like adventure and trying new things. His condition makes him fatigued and we can only spend a few hours together before he needs to go home and sleep. 

Having a family is very important to me. Historically, Methotrexate was thought to cause birth defects but a new study showed no significant risk for males taking it. Nevertheless, he doesn't feel comfortable trying for a baby on this medication, and he is not willing to take an alternative. 

I want him to keep going back to the doctors, to tell them that the meds aren't working, to ask if there is some solution to conceiving, but he feels there's nothing that can be done and has resigned to this way of life. I have tried to be patient, supportive but I am incredibly frustrated by the situation and by his passivity and I am becoming resentful. We have open conversations about this but we can't reach a solution. 

The things I want aren't absurd - I want to be able to hug my partner, I want to go for long walks, I want to have the chance of having a baby; I feel guilt as I know he didn't ask for this condition and I should be supportive and empathetic, but I also feel so frustrated. 

How much should I sacrifice for love? How can I manage my frustration without becoming resentful? Am I being too demanding?",1,1767299033.0,Advice,4,1.0,False
1q1e0yq,https://i.redd.it/66i2ox26rsag1.jpeg,Ye Shunguang saved my life,"I know it's silly, of course. But I've had major depression for most of my life and suicidal ideation on and off throughout. I was a lot like Lockspring, only able to see the ugliness, the greed, the selfishness, and all the needless suffering these things cause. I despaired and gave up hope, believing that this world isn't worth living in. Even after my hospitalization last year and partial recovery, I've just been going through the motions until now, not really wanting to die anymore, but not really wanting to live, either. 

Xiao'Guang showed me that even though the world can be ugly and people can be cruel, there are still good things worth protecting. Seeing Samwise Gamgee say that in LotR is one thing, but Xiao'Guang *showed* it. 2.5 story spoilers follow: >!After Shiyuan helped us restore her senses, on the way back to Suibian Temple, she stopped to marvel at every little thing in Failume Heights, looking at the world with childlike wonder because it was her first time seeing it so clearly since she came down from the mountain. She told us why she's willing to pay the terrible price the Qingming Sword demands, even after having experienced the brunt of it: she is so, so deeply in love with the world, even after seeing it at its worst. Every little moment of happiness, like enjoying the smell of fresh-brewed coffee, hearing kids laughing and playing, or walking the colorful streets of the city and admiring the sights, can be a glimmer of hope when times are at their darkest, and that alone makes it worth defending.!<

I used to believe that the good in the world was vastly outweighed by the bad, and that fighting for it wasn't worth it because the fight is hopeless. I understand now that hope is something we have to create with our own two hands, because a better world is only possible if we believe in it and fight for it.

So, thank you, ZZZ team. I really, *truly* want to live now, and I want to help tell stories that can give to others the same hope that Xiao'Guang gave to me.",84,1767298961.0,ZZZ_Official,5,0.88,False

It all started in my tiny, slightly-too-cramped apartment, fuelled by cold coffee and an insane amount of instant ramen. The idea for [Fictional Product/Service Name] had been buzzing in my head for months, a genuine 'aha!' moment that felt both terrifying and exhilarating. I remember sketching out wireframes on napkins, convinced this was either going to be huge or I'd just lose all my savings.

The early days were a blur of caffeine-induced coding sessions and endless research. There were so many moments I questioned everything. The self-doubt was a constant whisper in the back of my mind, especially when money got tight. I distinctly recall one particularly dark night, staring at my dwindling bank account balance, feeling a cold dread creep in. Was I just naive? Was this all a huge mistake? The weight of expectation, mostly from myself, was crushing. Sleep became a luxury, and my social life? What social life? It felt like I was constantly battling uphill, every step forward met with two steps back.

But then, something shifted. It wasn't a sudden explosion of success, more like a slow, steady dawn. We launched a beta, and the feedback, though not all perfect, was overwhelmingly positive from our first few users. Hearing people say they genuinely loved what we built, that it *helped* them – man, that feeling was indescribable. It was like a shot of pure adrenaline, washing away months of exhaustion and doubt. Each positive comment felt like a warm hug, validating every late night and every sacrifice.

We're far from 'made it' status, still grinding hard every single day. But looking back at that ramen-fueled dreamer, I'm genuinely proud of how far we've come. The fear is still there sometimes, a little tremor beneath the surface, but now it's mixed with a healthy dose of excitement and a belief in what we're building. It's not glamorous, it's messy, but it's *mine*.

So, for all you fellow dreamers and doers out there: what's one moment in your entrepreneurial journey that made you question everything, and what was the tiny spark that kept you going?",1,1767298882.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

1q1dyor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1q1dyor/meat_god_egghead_chapter_vi/,MEAT GOD - EGGHEAD: Chapter VI,"The streets seemed dark, more than usual that evening. My patrol car was going fast into the highway. All around us were long and sinister looking pine trees. A full moon was up there, somewhere in the black sky. Man, I was running forever, on that endless roadway by the forest.

“Right, is here,” detective Stevenson said, my partner that night. “Kilometer 150.”

I drove the patrol car to the right, into a dirt path on the side of the road, that leaded to the heart of the woods. It was pure darkness by then. We could only see the trees ahead, illuminated by the car lights. After a few minutes, I pulled over. In front of us, was a chain blocking the way. We got down the car, and went pass the chain and the “DO NOT TRESPASS” sing. We illuminated the way with our flashlights and kept on by foot.

A big house appeared in front of us. At least, four stories high. Most of the structure was made out of wood, strange for a building that size. There was a line of tiny windows in each floor. Some of the windows were lit. Next to the house, there was a big wooden barn. The structure looked more like an ancient church from the distance, and it was kind of eerie.

“Guess we gonna have to knock,” Stevenson said.

“Sure, trick or treat,” I responded.

So we did, we knocked at the fucking door, three or four times, but nobody answered. And we didn’t have a fucking warrant from the jury, so what the hell we were supposed to do?

“I know they’re here, Mitch,” Stevenson said, “can smell them.”

“Yeah…,” I said.

“Can you?” Stevenson asked me, “can you smell them too, Mitch?”

*Can’t smell shit, brother,* that’s what I was going to say to that dick-sucker of Stevenson, but yes, I could, I could smell them too. They smelled like meat and something else.

“POLICE!” Stevenson shouted again, banging the door with one fist, “open up, NOW!”

“Fuck ya’, pigs!” said a voice coming from inside the house.

That retard of Stevenson began to laugh, like a kid, but I never found funny when somebody call me a pig, don’t ask me why.

“Yeah?” I said, “well, why don’t you show your fucking face, if you’re so cocky?”

Silence.

“That’s what I thought!” I said, “Another coward who likes to hide.”

“Mitch!”

I glanced at Stevenson. He put a hand over the grip of his gun. He raised a hand to point at something coming out of the barn.

At first, I thought it was a kid, rolling in his tricycle, but when it got close, well, I couldn’t believe my damn eyes. It was a dog, a big black dog driving a tricycle, with a belt crossing its chest. He stopped and got off the tricycle, and stood there in all four, like your everyday dog.

Stevenson took out his gun and pointed it, pointed to the dog.

“Watch out!” he cried, “the bastard is armed!”

The German Shepherd stood in two feet, and brought a big Tommy gun from behind his back. Stevenson and I jumped behind the nearest hay bale to take cover. We heard a machine roar, and the bullets cutting the air. Next to us, there were a few barrels. A hell lot of holes blown from those barrels, and the water fell making a big pool at my feet. Crunched, I took my head out of cover, and checked the field at the other side. It was still dark, but I could see the smokes lines coming from the Thompson, and the black silhouette of the shepherd. Then it opened fire again, the bullets flew everywhere near me, to the bale, to the ground. I covered my head with my arms, but little after the dog stopped firing and I heard it howling, like a wolf.

Stevenson, who crawled behind a barrel, was breathing heavily. Both his hands were squeezing a Colt revolver. He looked at me in the eyes (yes, even in the dark, I think I could see him), and I nodded, as saying “Houston, ready to go.” Stevenson jumped out, stood and shot at the dog. The Thompson roared again, painting the night with its orange flame. My partner fell like dead wood on his back, the Colt hanging from his fingers.

I screamed in agony, but it was all in vain. Stevenson was dead for sure, for I could see the hundred holes in his chest.

The Devil’ Shepherd howled again, this time it heard like a sadistic laugh, as it shot in a straight line, trying to hit me, but I was quicker than the bullets, and got behind a barrel. The stent of gunpowder in the smoky mist and the metallic odor of blood in the air.

I was ready to shot the bastard down. I was ready to sacrifice myself in order to kill that fucking dog.

In that moment, Stevenson raised his hands and moaned. He wasn’t dead after all, it seemed.

“Stay awake,” I commanded to him.

He laid still, eyes closed but still moaning.

“Stevenson,” I said “c’mon, stay alive.”

Bullets flew, invisible, near my hiding spot.

With effort, Stevenson opened his eyes and smiled at me. I smiled back. Nothing had sense. He gasped for some air, dark blood coming from his mouth, shinning under the moon light. He was trying to say something.

“Don’t speak, you idiot!” I said, “keep your energies and stay awake.”

But he kept trying to talk. Maybe, I thought, it was important. Something I better hear. So I crawled toward him, keeping my head down for the bullets. I talked to him from behind the hay bale.

“Mimmm, Mimmmm” it was all Stevenson was saying in a low voice, gasping for air.

“What, what?” I asked him.

A burst of bullets broke his chest and forehead, and the shinning brain fell to the ground. His eyes, two white spheres, were somewhere mixed in the porridge of his mashed brain, inside the white pot of his open skull.

But his mouth was still moving.

“Mitch, wake up!” he said.

So I did.

Before my eyes, Linda, hair still wet, looking at me with her beautiful black eyes and her eyebrow frowned.

“They calling for an emergency!” she said, and got away.

I tried to stand, but there was some weigh over me. Little things, with fur of different colors, and I realized those were a lot of cats. Maybe five or seven, all over my chest and belly. I tried to sit up, making some of the cats to walk away, and I realized I was both naked and in a pink bed, with velvet sheets.

Then I remembered what happened.  
  


\* \* \*  


That morning, I drove to the principal highway. The radio call said there were something funky happening in the county morgue. We arrived at Lessing around seven, but saw nothing. I stepped out of the car, and felt a hand over my shoulder.

“What?” I said.

“Are you sure about this, Mitch?” Linda said, her big sunglasses covering her eyes.

“Why I wouldn’t, Lin?”

She left go my shoulder.

“I go with you,” she said.

In the streets, cars and sometimes people. No much, but there was a lot of traffic, and the cafe was open. Yes, I could smell the coffee and the fried eggs in the air, and my stomach roared when I remember I didn’t have my breakfast.

Right in the corner of Franklin street, rounded by a hell of a parking lot, was Barton’s morgue. Between other two cars, there was a brown Ford Galaxie, with a police siren of the roof, so you can assume there was, at least, one police officer inside. Other two patrol cars were coming behind us, but neither Linda nor I waited for them to arrive.

We entered death’s home, through the double crystal door. There was nobody behind the wooden counter, and the phone was ringing like hell. I picked it up.

“Hello?” I said.

“Yeah, good morning” I heard from the other side of the line. “Barton morgue?”

“Yeah”, I said, “what can I do for you, mister?”

“Officer McAlister, Michigan Police. Who I’m speaking with?”

“Right now with me, Mr. McAllister,” I said.

“And what’s your name, sir?” the officer asked.

“Sir, I’m Mitch Kovac, from the Michigan Police Department. Sounds familiar to you, hum?”

“… Mitch, that you?”

“How you guessed it, pal?” I asked.

“Say, Mitch, the hell you’re doing there?”

“We receive a call about something hot happening here, so me and my partner came to find out what was all the fuss about. But it seems nobody told ya’ about it, uh?”

“No a word.”

“Sad to heard it, Ron” I said, as I saw the other cops coming toward the door from the parking lot. “Listen, I’m a little busy here, Ron, but be a good boy and call me some another time, would you?”

“Wait, Mitch…!” I heard from the phone before I hanged up.

“Morning, fellas” said Chris Brasley when he got his fat ass inside the lobby. Next to him there was another guy I never saw in my life.

“The great Mitch, in person” Brasley kept saying, “and Mrs. Charm, hello.”

“Lick this clit!” said my partner, politely.

“See? A pretty fine *señorita,*” Brasley said to his partner, a guy around his twenties. “Feelin’ pleased for thy offer, my more than quite lovely lady. But if I don’t offend you with my sense of duty and labor, I feel more incline to find out what da-fuck is happening is this death-pit, pardon my French.”

“Yeah, we are too many officers for some autopsies witnessing,” said one the guys who just arrived, Johnny Strong. He was Sergeant or something at the time.

“I believe it too,” I said.

“Where is everybody?” Johnny asked.

“Maybe having fun with the bodies. The building seems empty,” said Brasley.

“Hello! Police here!” Johnny shouted.

“I wonder where they hide the coffee machine” said Brasley.

“Fuck this,” said Linda. “C’mon, Mitch, let’s check this place out.”

“Oh, what a couple of birds, eh?”

“Brasley, cut the shit for one minute, please,” said Johnny. “This is not time for jokes.”

So, we went to the main corridor, the one that led to the offices. There was a strong smell coming from somewhere near. Maybe the morgue.

“What the caller said?” Linda asked, from behind my back.

“I know as much as you do, now,” I answered.

Then we heard it, a ghastly and familiar sound: A muttered moan of pain. Like the one from the killer junkie. Linda looked at me, and unholstered her revolver. Half down the hallway, there was a cafeteria. I took a quick look, just to see a little dark stain on the floor, near a chair. It could be dried blood, or a long coffee stain, or neither. On the other side of the corridor, a black sign showed a white arrow pointing to the right, under the word «MORGUE». We continued, and I tried the black door.

“Fuck,” I said. “It’s closed.”

“But I have the key,” Linda said, pointing the muzzle of her gun at the key hole.

“What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy?!”

“Mitch” she said “you are the one who’s crazy. This is a fucking emergency, for God’ sake!”

I didn’t reply to her. I knew she was nuts, of course, but I didn’t know how much. I felt the peculiar urge to laugh.

“Everything’s okay, pals?” a male voice asked.

It was Strong, sticking his head from the other end of the corridor.

“Do you need a good hand to help you out, Lin?” we heard Brasley saying.

“Maybe I shot that fatass first, Mitch” Linda said to me in a lower voice. “You know, by mistake.”

I couldn’t take it. I laughed out loud, but I tried to keep it low after a bit, knowing that it was not the best moment for that. Linda laughed too, but hid her face with a hand.

“What’s so funny?” Strong asked, smiling.

“Nothing,” I said. “We cannot open the morgue.”

A scream broke the silence. Some of the other cops ran around, trying to find the source of the sound.

“Christ…,” Linda said, rising the gun toward my face without noticing. I put her revolver down.

“Lin, maybe you need to be careful with that, eh?”

“Oh, shit! Sorry, babe.”

*Babe.* That word.

The scream again, calling from behind a wall.

“It’s coming from the bathroom,” said Brasley’s partner.

He was referring the ladies bathroom. Brasley was about to enter, but Strong stopped him with a gesture.

“Hello!” Johnny said, face flat to the bathroom door. “This is the police, lady. Can you tell us what’s happening?”

Silence.

Everybody unholstered their guns, getting ready for some action.

“Lady, we are about to enter, okay?” Strong said, and slowly opened the door to take a look inside.

He entered, followed by Brasley and the other guy. I stood by the door, looking at the scene.

Except by the three cops, the bathroom was empty. Johnny walked the aisle between the toilet cubicles, and stopped at the last one in the right. There was a pair of brown boots in the space the door didn’t cover. Johnny knocked the door.

“Lady, are you all right?” he asked.

“Yes,” a sweet female voice said from behind the door.

Johnny smiled.

“Can you, please, come out?”

“No!” the voice said.

“Why not?”

“He is outside.”

“Who’s outside, miss?”

“My boss and his partne,r” the girl said.

“What’s wrong with that?”

Silence.

“I’m Sergeant Strong, by the way. What’s your name?”

“Rebecca,” the voice said. “Rebecca Anderson, sergeant.”

“Rebecca, nice to meet you. Tell me, please, did your boss, or his partner, try to do something bad to you?”

Silence.

“Lady, can you answer the question for me?”

“My boss, I mean, doctor Chung, he wasn’t himself,” Rebecca said.

“What you mean?” asked Strong.

“He was working all night,” said Rebecca, “didn’t see him this morning. Sometimes he does that, stays in his office or in the morgue all night, working. But this morning, doctor Jonestone came with a detective, from the police, and I heard shots and people screaming...”

“How, darling?” asked Strong “what happened?”

“I don’t know,” she said “but the detective was scared. He ran away, shooting at the hallway, so I called the police. That’s when I saw it: The cadavers, the bodies from the morgue… Oh, my god, oh, my god.”

Rebecca was crying, so Strong spoke to her with his sweetest tone.

“Relax, Rebecca. We are here to help. Nothing is going to happen to you, all right?”

“Uhummm,” she said.

“Tell me,” Strong continued, “why are you hiding in the bathroom?”

“The bodies…, they are alive! Really! They were moving, like normal people. They came and took the detective back to the morgue. Oh, it was terrible, terrible. He was screaming, the poor man. What a nightmare!

“After that, I got away and hid in the bathroom. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Or maybe I’m crazy.”

Then, Rebecca began to sob again. Strong didn’t say anything.

“His face was red,” she continued “and his eyes were big, and… expressionless. Like somebody who is chocking, I think.”

“Correct,” Strong said. “Do you mind if I open the door? Just want to check you’re okay. Don’t worry.”

“Are you part the special forces?”

“Mmm, no. I’m not.”

“I won’t come out until the special police arrive,” Rebecca said, with a trembling voice. “This is sick. I’m afraid, I won’t come out.”

“Sweetheart,” Linda said from behind me, sticking her face in the door frame, “the building is surrounded by the police. You are safe now.”

Strong smiled at her.

“Yeah, is true,” he said. “Right now, with us in here, whoever wants to hurt you, has to be out of his mind to try it. So believe me, everything is gonna be aaall right.”

“You don’t understand!” Rebecca said, crying this time. “Isn’t only my boss or Mr. Jonestone. It’s the bodies! The bodies are the ones you have to shot!”

Strong gave us a serious look, and made a gesture with his hand, rolling his finger in the air. The message: Let’s go out.

“Rebecca, we are leaving, all right? But one more question before we go: Are you hurt?”

Silence.

“Okay, we’ll wait outside. Whenever you feel good you can reach us. Otherwise, a medical examiner will arrive in a few minutes. Rebecca, it’s okay if you don’t want to talk with us, I understand your situation, but I beg you to let the doctor take a look at you, when he or she gets here.

“Do I have your word?”

“I just… won’t get out until the army arrives,” was Rebecca’s final statement.

Strong exited the bathroom. When he got with us, another two officers joined us.

“Who’s in charge here?” one of them asked.

“I’m Sergeant Strong, who better than me? Listen, you two wait outside, don’t let anybody enter. We still don’t know what we’re dealing with.

“Mitch, Linda, Parker, we’re gonna check the build…”

“Hey, what about us?” asked Brasley, talking about he and his partner.

“Yeah, you. You can…, just wait here,” said Strong.

“Here where?”

“Here, brain. Right here, by the entrance. Watch that crystal door, the one at the end of the corridor.”

“We are reinforcement, and you want us to look at the fucking entrance door?” Brasley asked.

“Watch your mouth, son. Mitch, come with me. Linda, Parker, you check the cafeteria.”

So Strong and I went to end of the hallway, and look at the morgue double metal door.

“What we gonna do about this, Johnny?” I asked.

“You are damn-kidding, right?”

“What?”

I looked at him. He was smiling.

“‘*I’m sorry, babe’?”,* he said and start laughing like a child. “I never heard that cold witch calling nobody *babe* in my life. And I know her for quite some time. So, what’s the story?”

I didn’t know what the hell to say. I couldn’t believe him, really.

“Are you serious?” I asked him. “Don’t you think this, this, is more important than…”

“Than the fact that you two are dating? Well, maybe you’re just right, Mitch. But when this whole thing ends, you and me gonna share some beers, like in the old times, and I want to hear all about it.

“It’s an order.”

Fuck, I got really angry back then. What a son of a bitch, that asshole. I mean, he was Sergeant or whatever, but that was really disrespectful, right? Whatever two partners do in their spare time is nobody business, right? I felt a strong urge to punch him in the face, but I didn’t. But all the fingers in my right hand closed.

“Okay, Mitch, relax. Didn’t mean to offend you,” Strong said, smiling. “Let’s open this damn door.”

“But how?” I asked. “There is not key and…”

Quicker than the wind, Strong kicked the door in the center of the keyhole. And hell, he was strong, the right bastard to wear the fucking name! After two powerful kicks, the double metal door broke open. Strong, a bull of a man, raised an open hand, showing me the way inside the morgue. A cold mist came from inside the room.

“After you, Mitch,” he said.

Inside the morgue, the lights were dim. The stench of rotten meat and blood was disgusting. I couldn’t see much when I got inside. I took me a while to find it out, but at last I could see everything was stained with a black liquid, maybe blood. The tiled walls, the metal lids of the freezers, even the light bulbs inside their metal box, in the ceiling, were dirty with crimson dark substance. The floor… it was a terrible mess! Like if somebody threw a bucket of blood over everything, just for some demon kids to play in it. Jesus…

The cold mist was coming from the open freezers, on the other side of the room.

Johnny grabbed his flashlight and illuminated here and there. A couple of dark bodies were resting on the metal beds, but there was something else. In the ceiling, a cluster of black figures.

I took me a little to figure out what they were.

They were hiding in the dark, those bastards.

1q1dyht,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1q1dyht/dawn_phenomenon/,Dawn Phenomenon,"Greetings, and Happy New Year.  I am type 2, diagnosed 15 months ago.  I am not medicated, have lost 40 pounds, and my last two A1c tests have been 5.9 and 6.2.  I have one coming up in two weeks.  I eat a low carb diet (about 30 grams a day) no grains, really just meat and vegetables, with my guilty pleasure being vanilla yogurt that only has 4grams of carbs per serving. 

The issue that I see is with Dawn phenomenon.  My BG averages at about 125 when I test it in the morning, and it will continue to go down throughout the day.  I don't test daily, but test enough to look for trends, and food response.  Typically I do not have my first meal until around 1-2 P.M., and try not to eat past 7:00 PM.  I have black coffee every morning, and only drink water.  I have started taking Berberine, fish oil, and a cinnamon pill.  I was hoping there was some advice out there on something that will cut back on the liver glucose production over night.  Thanks!",2,1767298793.0,type2diabetes,14,1.0,False
1q1dyhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detective/comments/1q1dyhh/50_bucks_to_anyone_who_identify_me/,50 bucks to anyone who identify me,"I have an ex that stalks me, and for that reason, I try to stay anonymous online for the most part. I'm curious if any of you can figure out who I am through putting together just the very simple pieces of information I normally give out on Reddit, and any other means necessary. $50 will go to the first person to correctly tell me my real name (either my chosen name or legal name, but must be first and last). Feel free to share any information you can find about me in the comments, and feel free to ask me personal questions. I may not answer all of them if they give away too much.

I live in the USA. I have two kids under the age of 10 with my abusive ex. I have 50/50 custody of them. I have been with my girlfriend for about 5 years. She's a somewhat noteworthy figure in a specific community in the world and has recently done some public speaking. She does not live in the USA but visits about once per year and helps me raise my kids over video chat. I have experienced what I will call half-homelessness due to my ex kicking me out a few years ago. There was no legal record of my existence for the most part until then due to abuse. I am younger than 40. I used to homeschool my kids and still teach them although they now go to public school. I am autistic, ADHD, and diagnosed cptsd. The username I used to use for everything was my first name, followed by the name my kids call me, followed by the age I was when I made it, and all of those rhyme with one another. One of my main aliases right now is the name of a planet which sounds somewhat similar to my first name, and my other alias is the name of a flower that starts with the same letter as my first name. That flower can be found in a game that I play often and that is part of my username in that game. I have one grey cat named Mouse. I used to have a black and white cat named Soba. I used to live in college housing despite not being a college student, and after that I rented a room in a trailer and lived with my landlord. I have now finally gotten a real apartment, in the same city as my ex, within walking distance from his apartment. I delete my Reddit account and start fresh every few months, but I've held onto this account for far too long. My primary email is a word that starts with S that I made up many years ago that means ""cuddles"". I have another email that is my full name. I have never been employed. I have a large network of friends who live near Toronto, Canada, despite the fact that I have never been there. The closest place walking distance to my apartment is a chain gas station, and my kids and I frequent a coffee shop within walking distance from us, as well as a library. The city we currently live in, which we moved to about two months ago, is known for being by the water. There is a large playground very close to where I live but we haven't been there yet because it's too cold. I was the president of the writing club for two years in high school, and my best friend was the vice president. I dropped out of school the summer after 10th grade. I was born and raised in a city that is about 45 minutes to hour away from where I am now, which rests at the north point of a lake that starts with O, which is a part of a particular group of lakes that starts with F. I have a matching tattoo with my girlfriend which is a simple 3 word phrase, and I have a tattoo for each of my kids which are drawings that they made. My mother's initials are C.M and my father's first initial is S. ",1,1767298792.0,Detective,2,0.67,False
1q1dxn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q1dxn7/does_meeting_a_guys_sisters_mean_anything_or_am_i/,"Does meeting a guy’s sisters mean anything, or am I overthinking this?","I (24F) was in New York for a friend’s birthday and met up with a guy (24M) I like who recently moved there.

Originally, we planned to meet for church and then grab lunch. Last minute, though, he asked if I wanted to go to church with his sisters instead. That honestly made me nervous, but I agreed. He’s really close with them, and I know how important they are to him, so meeting them felt like a big deal.
After church, he invited me to join them for community service, which I was actually really excited about. After that, he and I grabbed coffee, caught up, and then went our separate ways.
When we lived in the same city, there was definitely chemistry between us, but things have always gone through this cycle of fizzling out and reigniting. I think we both played a role in that. I think he likes me, but I’m also very good at being in denial about that kind of thing.

I guess I’m confused because introducing me to his sisters felt significant, especially since this wasn’t framed as a “date.” Am I reading too much into this, or does that suggest he sees me as more than just a casual friend?

Also, Happy New Year to All ☺️",0,1767298734.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

**Why This Pick?** 

The last 3 straight meetings between these two teams have cashed the Over. In addition, the Blackhawks have allowed a whopping 10 goals over their last two games. Chicago’s defense has hit a real skid, but their offense typically fares far better at home than they do on the road. Of course, it’s also not totally out of the realm of possibility for Dallas to bag 6 goals all by themselves. The Stars are undoubtedly hungry for a win after dropping their last 3 straight. I’m on the Over to cash here, friends.

1q1dv2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1q1dv2y/my_bloody_mary_experience/,My Bloody Mary Experience,"So, I was 13 or 14 years old at the time, and this was a couple years ago. It was midnight, and I couldn’t sleep and was also very bored, so what do I do? Stupid teenager me decides to play Bloody Mary, but there was one major issue.

My mother would never let me play Bloody Mary, because she is Christian and doesn’t want me getting involved with anything that screams “demons” in it. But luckily, at the time, Dad was working out of state.

So I light my bedroom candle with matches, and go to my bathroom, making sure the blinds are shut and the lights are off. I don’t lock the bathroom door due to not being allowed to do so because I’m an only child, and my parents don’t see the point in it. I say Bloody Mary three times in a half quiet, half loud voice, because my house echoes, and if my mom saw me doing this, she would kill me, and I turn the faucet on to half of a full blast.

I open my eyes, and see nothing in the mirror, so I assume everything is fine. But, as I go to the kitchen for a late-night snack, the coffee pot and the refrigerator turn on loudly. I don’t everything I can not to scream, because my mother had not set the coffee pot to make coffee at midnight. She always sets it to make coffee at 6:00 in the morning, on a school night.

So, will I play the game again? Yes. Why? I want something to happen in the bathroom.",3,1767298556.0,Paranormal,4,0.6,False

1q1duhr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1duhr,My 2025 year of puzzles.,"So I did a damn lot of puzzles this past year! According to puzzle tracker, I did 396 puzzles, though half of those were minis under three hundred pieces. 


At the beginning of 2025, I started taking photos of each one when I was finished as a way to keep track of what I had done when and decided to put it all together month by month. It’s super intense when viewed all together, oops. I also live in a state with crummy and unpredictable weather a lot of the year so we do quite a bit indoors. 


Another contributing factor to the sheer amount I’ve done is that I’ve been trying to avoid doomscrolling and puzzling is a relaxing habit to replace that with. Plus it’s way better for my brain so win-win-win I guess. 

Anyway, happy new year puzzle friends! ",22,1767298515.0,Jigsawpuzzles,4,0.96,False
1q1dtvb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1dtvb,Coffee spill on ASUS TUF F15,"So I was working on my laptop, and coffee spilled on about half of the keyboard and on the top vents (really worrying), I unplugged everything, powered off the laptop, and immediately took it to the kitchen to pat it dry with some kitchen tissues, I didn’t shake it to avoid further leakage throughout areas of the laptop that I don’t want, I tried turning it on twice, the keys illuminated and the laptop just shut down again, the orange low battery light has remained illuminated throughout this entire time, and I can’t get the laptop to turn back on. Like the complete idiot i am, I frantically took my hair dryer and blow dried my laptop for a good 3 minutes as a last ditch effort to evaporate/get rid of the remaining liquid inside the laptop, but I melted some of the keys (shift, a, s, d, z, and x), so now I have a fucked up computer and melted keyboard, what do I even do from this point forwards??
