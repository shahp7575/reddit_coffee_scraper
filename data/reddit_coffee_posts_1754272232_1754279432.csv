Pag nakatayo naman ako okay na nakakalakad pero i feel like anytime soon magiging samsung z flip phone ako sa gitna ng daan at tutupi nlng legs ko

So why am I asking this question? KASI D PA AKO MAKAKAUWI AGAD. MAMAYANG 8PM PAKO MAKAKAUWI DAHIL HUNDI GUMAGANA ELEV SA CONDO

In the spring semester of my Freshman year of college, I met this guy on a dating app. We hit it off immediately. We texted nearly every second of every day, except when we had classes or other conflicts. We really matched each other‚Äôs energies, and while most guys think I‚Äôm weird, he thought I was hilarious. We had very similar interests, values, and beliefs, which is somewhat hard to come by due to the region of the US that I live in. Not to mention, he was the most beautiful man that I have ever seen. Usually, a man this pretty would make me feel insecure, as if I wasn‚Äôt good enough for him because I‚Äôm not the most attractive girl ever, but I didn‚Äôt feel this way with him. It was refreshing. After a week of nonstop chatting, we finally set up a time to meet. Our date was only supposed to be a morning coffee date, but we ended up spending the whole day together. In total, we spent basically 12 hours together that day because neither of us wanted to leave. I‚Äôve never connected with someone so quickly. I‚Äôve only ever had one long term relationship, I‚Äôve dated around a bit here and there, but neither my long term relationship or any of my other talking stages have compared to the feelings I felt for this man. When we talked it was like a piece of me that I didn‚Äôt even know was missing, finally was put into place. I felt seen in a way I never had before. And for the first time in my life, I could picture a future where my story had a happy ending. (Side note: I‚Äôve struggled here and there with depression throughout the entirety of my life but my mental health had gotten so much better since going to college, the best it‚Äôs ever been, but even with my improved mental state I still knew that after college I would live a solitary and stressful life. But when this guy entered the picture, I saw a new life ahead of me) After our date, we talked for about another week before he broke things off due to his busy schedule and lack of time for a relationship at that moment. I was devastated. When I read the text of him breaking things off, I cried alone in my dorm for an hour and a half straight, then sent him a very emotional text about how I liked him so, so much and how if there was something wrong with me or if I did something wrong, then he should just be upfront about it. The next day I realized my error and sent him an apology and tried to get us to talk. But it was too late. I‚Äôm guessing my emotionality scared him off. He hasn‚Äôt texted me since. I‚Äôve tried to go no contact, but every once in a while the sadness gets too strong and I try to reach out. I know I‚Äôve been blocked, removed, or unadded on everything, but I still try. I‚Äôve read about limerance, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that, I genuinely believe this was love at first sight. At least for me it was. As of posting this, it‚Äôs been 121 days, basically 4 months since a man who I knew for two weeks ghosted me, and I have thought about him every day for 121 days. I have cried about this, every day for 121 days. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve tried to date since, but it‚Äôs not the same, and if I push myself to date too much, I get physically ill. The scariest part is that I know he‚Äôs never coming back, and that he doesn‚Äôt think of me still in the way that I think of him, otherwise he would reach out. I know I will never care this strongly about someone again, and I will never have the feelings that i felt with him ever again. I will either be alone for the rest of my life, or I will be with someone that I know I don‚Äôt love, wishing that that someone is someone else. I am genuinely at my wits end, and don‚Äôt know what to do. This has taken over my life. So Reddit, what do I do?",1,1754278126.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

In the weeks following the first build day, the forgotten lot had been transformed. A winding gravel path now snaked through newly constructed planter beds. Young saplings reached for the sun. A local blog post about their project had brought in more volunteers and a small flood of donated supplies. The quiet hope of Kenji‚Äôs solitary design had blossomed into the vibrant, joyful reality of a community in action.

The success, however, had made them visible.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. It was delivered by a courier, enclosed in a thick, stiff envelope bearing the city‚Äôs official seal. Kenji‚Äôs hands felt cold as he opened it. The language inside was a dense, suffocating thicket of legal jargon: *‚ÄúPursuant to Municipal Code 7B-14‚Ä¶ unauthorized use of public land‚Ä¶ pending a zoning review for commercial development‚Ä¶ you are hereby ordered to Cease and Desist all activities immediately‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The warmth of the last few weeks vanished, extinguished by the icy formalism of the document. The news spread through the small community like a killing frost. The upcoming weekend build was cancelled. The cheerful energy of their group chat was replaced by a stunned, angry silence. The beautiful, cooperative organism had been wounded.

As Kenji stared at the letter on his kitchen table, the Weaver‚Äôs voice emerged, its tone that of a detached military strategist analyzing a new kind of battlefield.

*‚ÄúObservation: The cooperative organism you formed is now being threatened by a larger, more powerful hierarchical structure, the bureaucracy. Your previous tools of ‚Äògoodwill‚Äô and ‚Äòmanual labor‚Äô are ineffective against this new opponent. The conflict has shifted from transmuting physical chaos to navigating systemic power.‚Äù*

The Weaver paused, then offered its cold, pragmatic counsel.

*‚ÄúThis system operates on leverage, not sentiment. Identify the key decision-maker within the opposing hierarchy. Isolate their primary motivation, financial, political, or egotistical. Apply precise pressure to that single point. That is the most efficient path to victory.‚Äù*

The advice was chilling, but it was also‚Ä¶ useful. Kenji saved it, a tool for later. His first task wasn‚Äôt strategy. It was rallying the troops.

He found his core group, Alex, Aunt Sarah, and George, at their usual coffee shop the next evening. The ""Cease and Desist"" order lay on the table between them like a tombstone. The mood was somber.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a developer,‚Äù Sarah explained, her voice tight with frustration. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been lobbying the zoning board for months to buy that land for a parking garage. Our little garden is a threat to his plan, so he‚Äôs using this ancient, unenforced ordinance as a weapon to shut us down.‚Äù

George the contractor let out a gruff sigh. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt fight city hall, kids. And you definitely can‚Äôt fight a rich guy who has city hall in his pocket. We had a good run.‚Äù

Alex stared into his coffee cup, his usual optimism completely gone. The easy victory they had achieved with their own hands seemed like a distant memory, a child‚Äôs dream.

Kenji looked at their faces, at the despair threatening to unravel everything they had built. He thought of his own journey, of the abyss, of the choice to act, of the quiet joy of laying the first stone. He had not come this far to be stopped by a piece of paper.

He straightened up in his chair, and his voice, when he spoke, was quiet but firm, cutting through the gloom.

‚ÄúBuilding the cathedral was the first step,‚Äù he said, meeting each of their eyes. ‚ÄúIt looks like the next step is protecting it.‚Äù

A new kind of silence fell over the table. It was not the silence of defeat, but of a dawning, steely resolve. The battle had changed. But the fight was far from over.",1,1754278029.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False
1mh2u8s,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/18/3922/reprints?utm_source=chatgpt.com,Energy Drinks May Be Dangerous for Your Health,"Energy drinks have surged in popularity, with brands like Red Bull, Monster, and Celsius dominating shelves and marketing campaigns. 

While these beverages offer promises of heightened alertness and energy, health experts warn that their stimulant-heavy formulas pose real risks‚Äîespecially for those with preexisting heart conditions or sensitivities. 

Ingredients like caffeine, taurine, and guarana can disrupt heart rhythms, elevate blood pressure, and, in genetically predisposed individuals, even trigger life-threatening cardiac events. 

Alarmingly, a condition called reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), which narrows brain blood vessels and can lead to stroke, has been linked to frequent consumption.

Despite being generally safe for healthy adults in moderation, energy drinks can exceed recommended daily caffeine limits‚Äîparticularly troubling for teens, whose limit is only 100 milligrams. 

The mix of caffeine with sugar, herbal extracts, and sometimes alcohol raises the stakes, contributing to anxiety, insomnia, digestive issues, and other health concerns. Medical professionals urge children, pregnant women, and individuals with cardiovascular or metabolic conditions to avoid energy drinks entirely. Safer alternatives like coffee, green tea, and electrolyte-based sports beverages are encouraged for sustainable energy without the risks.

A few weeks ago I came across a listing on [Acquire.com](http://Acquire.com) that caught my eye. It was a listing for a B2B SaaS doing about 9k MRR. The selling price for the SaaS was $500k!!

Now if you‚Äôve been following this substack for a while you‚Äôd know I have completed¬†[4 acquisitions of SaaS apps](https://justinbutlion.substack.com/p/my-4th-saas-acquisition)¬†starting in November 2022. The biggest deal I‚Äôve done was for $97k with half of that being paid over time using seller finance. A $500k deal was an entirely different beast.

I‚Äôd usually skip over such a listing because of its size but the more I dug into it, the better it looked. I decided to reach out to the sellers and start some early due diligence.

One of the requests I made from the sellers was to get access to their Stripe account so I could start digging into revenue retention (a massively important factor for me), and other important financial metrics (ARPU, lifetime value, monthly vs. annual segmentation, etc). Thankfully the sellers agreed and I spent a good few hours going through their Stripe data.

The more I learnt about the business, the more excited I got, but there was no chance I could finance this deal on my own. I started reaching out to some close friends who I both trust, and knew had an interest in this whole acquisition game that I played to guage interest.

When a close friend of mine who had previously raised millions for his own investment fund was interested in being apart of the deal, I decided to pick up the pace and go after the deal.

I submitted a letter of intent through the Acquire system with an initial offer (portion up front + seller finance) and waited.

I had built a simple financial model based off of the previous 6 months financials and even though the seller finance portion of the deal would significantly hurt cash flow, the expected return on investment based on the assumptions in the model was solid.

The seller sent a counter offer and we went back and forth a bit over chat discussing terms. I submitted a counter to his counter which was exactly what the seller wanted (more cash, less seller finance), but unfortunately the deal fell through.

At the end of the day the seller decided to take the deal off the table and take another shot at growing the app himself.

I was disappointed because I saw massive potential in the app. It not only would take my total MRR over 10k, but it would be an app that I could focus my energies in growing. My investors and I would buy it for 3.75X - 4.5X (depending on the final deal structure) and the plan was to grow it significantly. This is the holy grail of acquisitions; buying something at a good price that you grow significantly over time. This is where the outsized gains come from.

*\*Unforunately since I signed an NDA in order to start due diligence of the app I mentioned above, so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing specifics such as the name of the app, customers they worked with, etc.*

1mh2msv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh2msv,Roommate slammed her door after I asked her to do her dishes,"I (25f) live with two other girls. A is 25 and C is 22. C has an entire floor to herself with a kitchenette so she doesn‚Äôt use the kitchen, fridge, or sink unless she‚Äôs cooking a major meal. So basically it‚Äôs just A and I sharing the kitchen and living room downstairs. She‚Äôs been living here for 10 months and I‚Äôve been here for 2 years. We all have separate leases for our rooms and bathrooms. We did not know each other before moving in here. A doesn‚Äôt hang out in the living room so she doesn‚Äôt have to clean it but she does use the kitchen daily but also doesn‚Äôt clean that. 

She‚Äôs left her dishes for 7-10 days in the sink multiple times since moving in. I‚Äôve never said anything because sometimes I leave mine for like 2-3 days and don‚Äôt want to be a hypocrite. But this summer the fruit flies are other worldly so I have been very strict with myself about not letting anything sit overnight because it grosses me out. I spent like $30 on those LED bug catchers and the fly tape to catch the bugs. I have attached pics of every text I‚Äôve sent about it to the roommate group chat. 

I wish pictures could capture how bad the smell is with her dishes. It literally smells like ass in our downstairs when you walk in so I‚Äôve been buying candles to try and cover it up because she literally won‚Äôt do her fucking dishes. Idk if it doesn‚Äôt bother her because she‚Äôs holed up in her from like 6pm to 8am and only comes out to trash the kitchen but it‚Äôs so fucking bad. 

My last straw was Thursday when I came downstairs after her shit sat in the sink for over a week and the sink stopper was FILLED with food and there was bullshit all over the walls of the sink. I was already irritated with her because of the trash thing I mentioned so I actually started tweaking. I deep cleaned the entire kitchen before I logged on for work and then texted the chat. 

In the 10 months she‚Äôs lived here, shes vacuumed and mopped once. She decided to announce she was deep cleaning over a weekend in December and then literally just mopped and vacuumed the common area. She‚Äôs never cleaned the stove off once. I do it every time. I once left the shit she got on the stove for a full week in hopes that she‚Äôd clean it and she didn‚Äôt. She leaves coffee stains on the counter and never cleans them up. She left her moving boxes in the dead center of the kitchen and living room area for months before I just moved them into the basement (I asked her multiple times to move them). 

This was all happening originally during the Philly trash strike, so that was also awful. When the trash finally got taken, the smell outside of our house was fucking horrendous. I took an hour and spent like $25 on fabuloso and some specific cleaner that works on concrete and scrubbed the sidewalk in front of our house with a broom until the smell was gone. I also ice and shovel in front of our house in the winter. I‚Äôm the only one who takes out the trash. I‚Äôm the only one who brings in the recycling bin in. You get the picture.

Tonight I decided I can‚Äôt just be a keyboard warrior and text about it so in the most even tone I could muster I just said ‚Äúcan you please do your dishes tonight‚Äù and she said yes and slammed the door to her bedroom. It‚Äôs been 3 hours and the dishes are still in the sink and it‚Äôs 11pm where we are. What do we think the odds are they‚Äôre done before she leaves for work tomorrow?

I know it sounds like nothing for me to ask her verbally, but when we‚Äôve had convos about other minor issues in the past she blames whatever she did or didn‚Äôt do on being neurodivergent, having anxiety, and being depressed. I‚Äôm also anxious, depressed, and have adhd. I have never told her those things because they‚Äôre irrelevant 99% of the time because we do not interact. it‚Äôs so upsetting every time there‚Äôs an issue and she pulls that out. I literally spiral about the most minor interactions with her hours because she makes me so anxious. 

Would it be dramatic to involve the landlord? At this point it‚Äôs inhibiting my ability to use and enjoy the home and common areas, and we aren‚Äôt on the same lease so it feels less and less like a roommate conflict the more times it happens and more and more like it‚Äôs a lease violation on her part.

Well, this month I had a hard time finding a pharmacy that could get 10mg zenzedi.. not sure why, but seems like all the pharmacies in my area had supply issues with the 10mg doses and was impossible for them to order. So I am now on generic dextroamphetamine Sunrise manufacturer.. 

Tell me why I feel absolutely cracked out??? It‚Äôs the same dose. So why is this so much different than brand? üò≠ I usually take my first dose at 8am, and second dose at 12pm and never had issues with insomnia. 

The first day I tried these generics, I felt very speedy and just had horrible side effects (jaw clenching, clammy hands, racing heart, and throbbing migraines etc). Doesn‚Äôt really seem to be helping my adhd AT ALL. Well, that night I got absolutely ZERO sleep.

Due to being completely wired all night, I ended up taking my meds again yesterday thinking I‚Äôll probably crash out by the night time due to not having any sleep the night before, and nope - another night of no sleep‚Ä¶

I just bought some zzzquil to hopefully help me get some rest tonight since I have now gone 2 days without sleep. 

Note: if you are wondering why I am still taking my meds even when it is giving me insomnia, I am a mother to a highly active toddler and I cannot function without my medication - especially when I haven‚Äôt gotten any sleep.. I was a complete zombie and needed that extra push to get me through the day and unfortunately, coffee gives me way too much anxiety. if I was still child-free, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have taken them again since I would‚Äôve have the luxury to crash and sleep during the day. 

Can anyone tell me why this is happening? I originally switched from Adderall to Zenzedi to escape that ‚Äúspeedy‚Äù ‚Äúwired‚Äù feeling I would get from adderalls levoamphetamine and even then, I would not get insomnia unless I took my second dose way too late in the afternoon.. is it even possible to return medication? I am self-pay, so I hate that I spent money on medication I don‚Äôt even want to take anymore at this point‚Ä¶ üòî ",1,1754277341.0,zenzedi,0,1.0,False

So, I was at this one company for about three years. In the beginning, we were so full of hope, you know? But as we hired more and more people, our business just‚Ä¶ stalled. Leadership couldn't make a decision to save their lives, and we missed so many chances. Eventually, they just gave up on our original plan‚Äîit was a super crowded market anyway‚Äîand decided to try something completely new.

A few months later, I landed at a new startup that had just gotten its A-round funding. I was so excited. The field they were in had so much room to grow, and I even packed up and moved to a whole new city for the job... which, yeah, feels a little impulsive now.

Well, I lasted all of two months. Then they told me they needed someone with more experience. And just like that, I was thrown right back into the job-hunting nightmare.

So now I'm sitting in this coffee shop, anxiously trying to fix my resume, and all I can hear are the people around me. They're laughing, talking about their study abroad agency, their crypto trades, their physical shops. The whole world is still spinning, but mine feels like it's just‚Ä¶ stopped.

It really makes you think... Do I have to find a job with a fixed schedule? Will finding one finally prove my worth or something?

But I know myself. I don't have that special gut feeling, at least not right now. I can't just spot an unmet need like all those amazing founders do. And yet, when I look at the job market, it feels like that's exactly what they expect. They're not looking for someone to do a job; they're looking for a superhero who can fix every problem, find every opportunity, and save the day when it all goes wrong.",1,1754276858.0,u_Alternative-Ear-3156,0,1.0,False

1mh2gs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/1mh2gs1/beware_of_greenburg_cafe_in_greenpoint/,Beware of Greenburg Cafe in Greenpoint,"TL:DR at the bottom to simplify it

I Also posted this to r/Greenpoint sub for anyone that saw it there first [Link to Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenpoint/s/8I38LCRHZt)

Writing here to expose this place for all the lying scum they've put me, my ex coworkers and the community through. 

Recently Greenburg on Franklin St in Greenpoint opened up back in the beginning of the summer of this year, and I left my last job in February was searching for a new gig after my semester ended (im in Undergrad) and Greenburg called me for an interview, liked me and my experience and hired me in mid May and I left in early June. 

HOLY SH*T did I walk through the gates of hell. 

So first of all, in the month that I worked there, my own and my co-workers paychecks always had errors, we were never paid correctly for our hours and even on our pay stubs it was incorrect. My own check would say I worked just 12 hours for 2 weeks when in reality I worked for 26 hours (yes, I was clocked in for all my shifts). And the same thing happend to my coworkers as well, one of them was paid for $17/hour when she was promised $20/hour. Everytime we went to the owner (its owned by a couple, but the woman is the one thats incharge of daily operations) would give us the run-around and tell us workers, to personally contact the accountant, fully ignoring any and all responsibility and blaming the accountant. 50% of the time when you would contact those accountant she would either give you some lackluster excuse like ""I'll look  into it"" or ""Send me the correct hours you worked"" or the other 50% of the time she would just completely ignore you and not messages back. Wait, Hang on, get this. The accountant was in CALIFORNIA, so there was absolutely no way to physically go to her office and ask for her. So you're basically at their mercy for your unpaid wages and if you ask the owner about the accountant ignoring you, she'll eventually get irate and accuse you of being the bad person for asking you for your proper paycheck and that ""you need to stop bothering her and just wait"". 1 girl I worked with said the owners boyfriend (they're not married but have a kid) yelled at her over the phone when she called about her check and told her ""Its the accountants responsibility! Call her!"". Red Flag #1. 

Red Flag #2, The owner has absolutely no idea how to run a cafe, she admitted to us to our faces ""Yeah I have no idea how a cafe runs I barely drink coffee myself, so that's all on you guys"". So from the get-go there's no standards, no official rules, which explains why so many customers complain about their drinks being made wrong, because the workers have nothing to go by. You're pretty much set up for failure. When first hired we did a  1 day ""training"" at another roastery on Grand st if I remember correctly, but again there's no official rules in beverages in the actual cafe itself. 

Red Flag #3. Everything is Wildly overpriced, the same Matcha you can get at somewhere like MokaCafe or Sippy Cafe or Odd Fox cafe for $5 is like $6-$7 and its the exact same as those other places. They have a ""Triamisu"" latte/matcha. Thats like over $8. Its just a Mocha/chocolate matcha with whipped cream Thats it. Just add chocolate syrup to your latte or matcha and thats the ""Tiramisu"". Again, pretty much shelling out near $10 for something you can get somewhere else for $5. The Avocado toast is worse. I think the Greek toast is like $12 or $13? And its just basic country loaf bread with cream cheese, feta, onions and tomatoes and olives. Its about the size of a Roku TV remote, yeah again OVERPRICED. Don't waste your money, please just save it and go somewhere else. 

Finally, Red Flag #4. They hire and fire people like a revolving door. They'll hire someone, let them work for a few weeks then fire then for meaningless reasons. One of my coworkers got fired because they accused him of ""sweating too much"" (üòë) that man barely sweated a drop so I have absolutely no clue what they were talking about. The guy I worked with that did food they fired him for whatever reason, I have no idea why because he was really nice and helpful. Then rehired him and ""apologized"" saying they changed their minds (üòê). Don't be surprised if you go there regularly and see 1 barista for a few weeks then never see em again and there's a whole new team. And then next week there's a whole new team again. Ridiculous.

So basically as you can tell, this place is terrible, has no idea what in the world they're doing with their business. Screw over both employees and customers. I recently heard from my former manager that apparently the couple used to live in California and the woman apparently owns other businesses over there like a weed shop and a bunch of Airbnbs. She tried to open this place over there but couldn't so they moved to NYC to try their luck in Greenpoint since this neighborhood is becoming trendy. 

Edit: Forgot to mention, the cafe likes to collaborate with social media influences, Smaller businesses like fashion boutiques, book clubs, etc. if you run anything like that in Brooklyn/NYC area DO NOT engage with them, DO NOT do any kind of business with them. I was also told by my old coworkers that the owner did business with a guy that did food supply or something? And completely screwed him over by not paying him for his shipment. But yeah this place is a complete scam, stay far away and feel free to share this post to others

TL;DR Stay the hell away from this place. DO NOT apply for a job here if you're looking for a side gig/extra cash. DO NOT come here and waste your money on overpriced drinks that will be made incorrectly. If you're the owner of a small business that likes to do collabs, event promoter, or a social media influencer of some sort, DO NOT do any sort of business collab/sponsorship with them. Don't be fooled by the decor and how ""modern, minimalist"" it looks. The owners are scum and should be barred from opening up a business ever again

- Latte (tend to prefer medium roast beans)

- Occasional plain Espresso shot

- Occasional hot coffee

1) drinks taste as good or better than Starbucks. Honestly I‚Äôd be disappointed if the lattes weren‚Äôt better than Starbucks. I‚Äôve had great lattes from high end commercial super automatics and also great lattes at local shops. Surely I can get this in a new machine.

2) relatively simple to make. Ease of use is very important. She wants to be able to get her coffee made quickly, make the cold foam, and be done with it.

I‚Äôm not much older but I did a lot early, so I had just finished college while she was starting it. As a result, we were living more like adults than college kids. When she spent the time away, she realized that she had been missing out on a bunch of ‚Äúcollege stuff‚Äù and she broke up with me. It was devastating, and I couldn‚Äôt understand why we shouldn‚Äôt be able to figure things out.

I never initiated conversation after she got back and moved her stuff out of my apartment. All the same, she found a reason to text me once a month. After 6 months apart, she called me to tell me that she missed me, and asked if we could talk in a month when the semester started. We met for coffee and she said that when she had called me, she wanted to get back together, but now that she had had time to think about it, she had a gut feeling that it wasn‚Äôt the right time. Understandably, this was crushing. She talked about how badly she wanted to make things work but how it just didn‚Äôt feel right. I was cordial and understanding. After all, I want her to be happy, and I also want to be with someone who wants to be with me. All the same, I was crushed.

I am posting to help sell my dad's car to pay off the debt incurred from hospital bills due to surgery ng brother ko. The price is 190,000. Kia Rio Sedan 2015. Negotiable pa po ito ü•∫ Details are on the last pic. You can message or call him on his number here : 09190717588

Sorry for the long read but we are desperate for funds.

My brother is 22 this year, and he is autistic. My parents are both retired, my mom put up a small coffee shop just beside our house where I help her out. Yung ate ko naman, VA sya WFH.

Last Friday po, we had my brother operated sa Pines City Hospital due to Hernia, bale yung intestines nya po lumalabas sa testicle area nya kaya nagswollen po yung testicles, and can be dangerous if left.

Supposedly, dun po kami sa Baguio General Hospital which would cost way less. Pero we can't push thru due to the lack of semi-private/private rooms. Yung available lng na rooms are the general ward, and again, my brother is autistic, non-verbal po sya, and he would be very loud and would try to run around. Due to this, my mother wouldn't want to disturb naman po yung other patients kasi alam po namin how hyper my brother would get. Especially po pag overstimulated sya, he would cry loudly and run around. Hindi naman sya violent, but with the case of disturbing patients who are resting and all, dun sana kami sa semi-private/private rooms.

The problem was, wala pong available na rooms suitable for my brother, and nung nag ask si mama sa hospital kung kelan mayroong available room, sabi nila mga 100+ nasa waiting list, and knowing that waiting too long will worsen yung kalagayan ng brother ko.

Thus, we were advised to go to Pines for his operation, which is a private hospital but costs a bit less than other private hospitals in the city.

Nagstay lang sina mama ng one day, bale operation was Friday, and nagcheck out sila ng Saturday kasi di talaga afford ng everyday stay doon until recovery. Yes, nag PhilHealth po kami, and we can't apply sa Malasakit since privy hospital.

So, from around 35k from BGH, it became 91k ü•≤ We borrowed from relatives who were willing to lend to us totalling to around 20k, pati yung savings ng ate ko na and her pay this month, pero kulang pa talaga. Tapos ayaw ni hospital na mag promissory note si mama üò≠ Kaya she had to take out sloan to pay off the remaining para masettle and bring my brother home. so yung sloan nya na 29k yung need bayaran naging 47k. Please don't judge my mom for bringing out Sloan.

Please please help us, willing to negotiate naman po. We are struggling since the coffee shop doesnt generate enough for our monthly expenses (bills,food,other costs din for the shop) so nagrerely din sina mama kay ate minsan (most of the times). Tapos biglang nagka emergency yung kapatid ko, and now my parent's are stuckk in debt.
--

I can provide bills po from the hospital for proof via dm. Thank you so much for reading and we hope mabenta po tong sasakyan ni daddy. Kahit short run lng, basta to pay off lng po yung debts nila mama. I know we'll get through.

# Eco-friendly Practices

Using coffee grounds in eco-friendly ways can have a positive impact on the environment. Instead of throwing them away, you can repurpose them for gardening and other sustainable practices. These methods not only reduce waste but also enrich your garden‚Äôs soil and provide a healthier habitat for plants.

# Composting

Composting coffee grounds is an excellent way to recycle kitchen waste. The grounds are rich in nitrogen, making them a great addition to your compost pile. Here‚Äôs how you can incorporate coffee grounds into your compost:

* **Add coffee grounds**: Sprinkle the grounds directly onto the compost pile.
* **Layer with other materials**: Mix them with carbon-rich materials like dried leaves or cardboard.
* **Maintain balance**: Aim for a 4:1 ratio of browns (carbon) to greens (nitrogen).

Here‚Äôs a quick guide to composting with coffee grounds:

|Material|Type|Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Coffee Grounds|Green (Nitrogen)|1|
|Dried Leaves|Brown (Carbon)|4|
|Cardboard|Brown (Carbon)|4|

By following these steps, you can ensure that your compost pile stays balanced and healthy. The nitrogen from the coffee grounds accelerates the decomposition process, resulting in rich, fertile compost for your garden.

# Mulching

Another great use for coffee grounds is as mulch. Mulching helps retain moisture in the soil, suppress weeds, and improve soil health. Here‚Äôs how to use coffee grounds as mulch:

* **Spread evenly**: Apply a thin layer of coffee grounds around your plants.
* **Mix with other mulch**: Combine with other organic materials like straw or wood chips.
* **Avoid thick layers**: Too much coffee ground can create a barrier, blocking water and air.

Benefits of using coffee grounds as mulch include:

1. **Improved soil texture**: Coffee grounds help aerate the soil, improving drainage.
2. **Nutrient boost**: They release nutrients like nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium into the soil.
3. **Pest deterrent**: Some pests, such as slugs and snails, are repelled by coffee grounds.

Using coffee grounds as mulch is simple and effective. You can also make a mulch mixture:

|Material|Proportion|
|:-|:-|
|Coffee Grounds|1 part|
|Straw/Wood Chips|3 parts|

This blend ensures that your mulch is balanced and beneficial for your garden. By using coffee grounds in these eco-friendly practices, you contribute to a more sustainable environment and healthier garden.

* **Composting:**¬†Coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen, which is beneficial for compost. Add them to your compost pile to enrich the soil.
* **Fertilizer:**¬†Sprinkle used coffee grounds around your plants. They act as a natural fertilizer, providing essential nutrients to the soil.
* **Pest Repellent:**¬†Spread coffee grounds around your garden to keep pests like slugs and snails at bay.

By incorporating these methods, you can significantly reduce waste and make a positive environmental impact.

# Resourcefulness

Being resourceful means finding new uses for items instead of throwing them away. Coffee grounds can be repurposed in many creative and useful ways.

Here are some resourceful uses for coffee grounds:

* **Cleaning:**¬†The abrasive texture of coffee grounds makes them excellent for scrubbing pots and pans.
* **Deodorizing:**¬†Place a bowl of dry coffee grounds in your fridge or freezer to absorb odors.

1mh28z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mh28z3/my_life_fell_apart_after_mom_died_pt_2_final/,My Life Fell Apart After Mom Died (Pt 2) [FINAL],"I waited until later.¬†

The house exhaled around me‚Äîlong, slow, mechanical. Like lungs that had forgotten what air was supposed to taste like. The moment he shut the front door behind him, something in the walls loosened. I listened to the rhythm of his departure: six steps down the porch, gravel crunch, then the idle hum of his car pulling away. It was always the same. Predictable.¬†

I counted to three hundred. Then I rolled.

Mom‚Äôs door opened with the sound of a splinter remembering how it died. I hadn‚Äôt been inside since‚Ä¶ since she passed. Since her scent still clung to the air like perfume on old clothes. But now the air was cold. Not just chilly‚Äîcold like a place that had been vacuum-sealed by time. Cold like the oxygen had been replaced with memory. Cold like her body had only just been lifted.¬†

I rolled in, slowly.

The desk looked wrong. It was too clean. Impossibly clean. Sanitized. As if someone had surgically removed all trace of the person who once sat there. I stared at the space where the Pathlight folder should have been‚Äîunder the brass lamp, just left of the coaster that still held the faint watermark of her tea. That folder‚Äôs existence anchored me, it was the hope that maybe everything really was deliberately laid out by her for whoever came along after. Her handwriting in crisp blue ink, neat and motherly. A paper spine. A record of how to care for me. How to keep me *safe.*

Gone.

Panic rose in my throat like bile. I yanked open the top drawer. Empty. A hollow scraped through my ribs. I turned to the filing bin. The closet. The linen chest. I opened and closed the drawers so fast. My heart beat like a wounded thing trying to crawl out through my collarbone.

Nothing.

No folder. No notes. No lifeline. Only a faint smudge on the surface of the desk. A single fingerprint. Wide. Too wide. Oil pressed into wood grain like a half-buried fossil. Almost‚Ä¶ reverent.¬†

And then‚Äîbehind me, movement. I turned and nearly screamed.¬†

Tom stood in the doorway. His silhouette backlit by the amber hallway bulb. He held his keys like a charm. His expression was mild. Almost sweet. But his eyes‚Äîhis eyes were dissecting me.¬†

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked, head tilting. Like a bird watching something twitch before it dies. ‚ÄúI forgot my phone.‚Äù

My hands locked on my armrests. I steadied myself before I could unravel right in front of him.¬†

‚ÄúI was looking for the folder,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe one my mom left.‚Äù

He stepped into the room slowly. Deliberate, predatory softness. Like he didn‚Äôt want to startle me‚Äîonly corner me.

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYeah. I remember seeing that when I got here.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo where is it?‚Äù

He smiled then. The kind of smile that thinks it‚Äôs being comforting. But his teeth looked too symmetrical. Like they weren‚Äôt his. Like he‚Äôd borrowed them from someone more trustworthy.¬†

‚ÄúProbably got mixed in with the paperwork I gave Pathlight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt give them anything.‚Äù

A pause. The barest flicker of emotion behind his eyes. Something calculating.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Couldn‚Äôt. He took a step closer. The keys still swung from his finger like a pendulum. Tick. Tick. Tick.

‚ÄúI can help you look, if you want. You don‚Äôt have to do everything alone.‚Äù

The room shrank. The air thinned. What an empty gesture‚Äîwhat a monstrous thing to say. Of course he‚Äôd help. Of course he‚Äôd offer to find the evidence he erased.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ overreacting.‚Äù

The words tasted like rust in my mouth.



Sunday dinner was fish. Tilapia, pan-seared and dusted with thyme. Soft vegetables on the side. Lemon slices placed just so‚Äîlike Mom used to. He brought the meal to my room. The plate was warm, the presentation delicate. Fork and knife stationed to the side along with my meds. I didn‚Äôt eat it.

He sat in the living room watching a nature documentary. Humming. I closed my door and didn‚Äôt leave my room. Couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt sit at my desk. Couldn‚Äôt stream. Couldn‚Äôt game. My rig felt alien. Plastic and cold and *touched*.¬†

At 7:31, he knocked. Three slow, soft taps. Measured. Practiced, as everything else than came from the man.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna run to the pharmacy before they close,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúForgot to stop by earlier.‚Äù

My heart climbed into my ears. If this was real‚Äîif any of it was real‚ÄîI had a window.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I heard his keys. Heard his shoes scrape the mat. Heard the door open, then close, then silence. I waited, then moved. His shoes were gone. No coat. I wheeled over to the window and saw that his car was absent from the driveway.

I rolled down the hall. Slow. Breath in my throat. Every inch forward felt like lowering myself into cold water.

The guest room door was locked. It was never locked. Apparently he thought locks were optional, I guess I thought the same. I returned with tools. The screwdriver slipped into the lock like a secret. The butter knife kept the pressure steady. I worked quickly. Quietly. The tumblers gave on the second try. The door creaked open like a wound.¬†

The air inside didn‚Äôt move. It just sat. Heavy. Dense. Smelling faintly of metal and bleach and something older. Something sickly. Dust floated in my chair‚Äôs front light like dandruff from something divine and decaying.

Everything was in its place. Bed made. Tight corners. Pillow fluffed.

The folding table was beneath the window. On top: stacks of medical forms. Not copies. Originals. Pathlight Home Health, stamped and watermarked. Some pages had smears. Not ink. Something browner. Thicker. Dried at the edges.

There was a corkboard on the far wall. Pinned screenshots of my stream. Freeze-frames of me mid-laugh, mid-focus. My old Discord profile‚Äîdeleted three years ago. The avatar I used before Mom got sick. Before *everything.*

At that moment, I was glad I skipped dinner because I felt like I was about to empty the contents of my stomach on the guest room floor.

A leatherbound notebook sat on the corner of the bed. Hands shaking, I picked it up and flipped through the pages. It was full of notes. All handwritten. All about me. Each one dated meticulously:  
***4/23 - Doesn‚Äôt like sour candy. Wrinkles nose when she laughs.***  
***5/13 - Plays better when it rains. Loves lofi hip-hop.***  
***6/02 - Had a kitten when she was 6. Hates the smell of cotton candy.***

Each one a surgical, dissecting observation or fun fact that I‚Äôd shared about myself at some point.  
***7/19 - Said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alone.‚Äù on stream. Timestamp 1:16:42***

One page, in red ink, read only:  
***She‚Äôs almost ready.***

My hands were trembling. My arms didn‚Äôt feel like mine. My lungs had forgotten how to inflate. He hadn‚Äôt just followed me. He hadn‚Äôt just watched me. He‚Äôd studied me. Memorized me. Dug into me like a maggot digging through shit.

This was a shrine. A lab. A coffin.¬†

I was the specimen. The experiment. The offering.¬†

He was never just the fucking nurse. He was the echo of every time I said I was alone, every part of me I‚Äôd ever shared online. Every time, he was listening.

I heard the car before I saw it drive by the window.¬†

The crunch of gravel beneath tires. The low, exhausted exhale of the engine. A door shutting soft enough to sound apologetic. Like he still thought he could slip back inside without consequence. He was back. My whole body locked. Every joint screamed in quiet alarm. The air around me thickened with viscosity. I sat frozen in the guest room, my fingers clenched around the armrest of my wheelchair. My mind raced through possibilities, each one collapsing under the weight of reality. Run? Hide? Plead?

No time.

I turned and rolled fast‚Äîout of the room and down the hall to my bedroom. I slammed the door shut behind me. My fingers shook as I locked it. Click. A tiny, fragile sound. Not enough.I grabbed my phone off the bedside table, almost dropped it. I stabbed at the screen with fingers that barely felt like mine.¬†

911

It rang. The operator picked up.

‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

""There‚Äôs someone in my house,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúPlease. I think‚Äîhe‚Äôs my nurse, but he‚Äôs not. I think he‚Äôs been stalking me. Please send someone.‚Äù

I gave them the address. The words stumbled out, barely forming, just pieces of truth scraped together in panic. The operator told me help was on the way.¬†

She asked me to stay calm.¬†

Calm. I looked at my reflection in my bedroom mirror‚Äîsallow skin, wide pupils, my whole face pulled taut like a stretched canvas. There was no calm. Only that shrieking hum behind my eyes. Then I saw the tower light. Still blinking. Still on. I rolled over fast. Opened OBS and slapped the ‚Äústart streaming‚Äù button with trembling hands. The scene opened, webcam on. The feed lit up. Chat appeared, like it always did. My people. The ones who watched me survive grief once before.

**‚Äúlate night stream?‚Äù**  
**‚Äúhey spark u good?‚Äù**  
**‚Äúyo what‚Äôs the occasion lol‚Äù**

I leaned into the mic.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in here, please‚Ä¶ listen. This isn‚Äôt a stream.‚Äù

The messages slowed.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a bit,‚Äù I said, voice cracking. ‚ÄúI need help. There‚Äôs a man in my house. He‚Äôs not who he says he is.‚Äù

**‚Äúwtf‚Äù**  
**‚Äúis she serious??‚Äù**  
**‚ÄúNO WAY‚Äù**

I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him. RainRider. He‚Äôs been here the whole time. He‚Äôs been pretending to be my nurse. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs planning. But he broke into my life.‚Äù

Then the knock. Soft. Measured. Careful.  
  
‚ÄúSarah?‚Äù His voice outside my door. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

My mouth filled with acid. My vision shook.

‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúStay the fuck away from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSarah, what‚Äôs going on? Are you hurt? Can you open the door?‚Äù

The knock became a pound.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him,‚Äù I told the stream. My voice was a thread wrapped around a scream. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs him at the door. I called the cops. They‚Äôre on their way.‚Äù

Outside: ‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúYou called the cops?‚Äù

I looked around, frantic. My breath came in shards. The room warmed, pulling at the corners like a¬†bad dream.¬†

Then I saw it‚Äîthe tray from dinner. The knife. I snatched it just as the door exploded open. 

Tom stood there, his body blocking the doorway, his eyes scanning the room with mechanical calculation. 

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he asked. His voice had the audacity to sound concerned. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

I raised the knife with a trembling hand. It felt too light, too dull, too stupid to be a weapon. But it was all I had.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come near me,‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúI saw your notes. I saw your room. I know who you are.‚Äù

He blinked again. Tilted his head. ‚ÄúSarah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre RainRider. You‚Äôve been stalking me for years. I know you.‚Äù

He stepped forward with palms out.

‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre confused. You‚Äôre scared. That‚Äôs okay. Just put the knife down. I don‚Äôt want you to get hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking touch me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about you.‚Äù His voice dropped into something gentler. Something predatory. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not thinking clearly. We should talk.‚Äù

He reached for me. I slashed. The blade cut shallow across his hand. Not deep enough to do damage, but enough to make him howl, make him mad. Then he lunged. We crashed sideways into my desk. The mic toppled. The camera wobbled. The world tilted and shattered. His weight crushed me. My back screamed. My breath vanished beneath him.

I reached out‚Äîmy fingers brushed the JellyMini controller on the floor beside the chair. I grabbed it. I swung. It cracked against his head. Blood dripped on my shoulder. I swung again, harder. Bone gave way. He slumped forward. His body collapsed on top of mine. Too heavy. My chest couldn‚Äôt rise. My vision darkened at the edges. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. The sound caught in my throat like a fishhook.¬†

I heard sirens somewhere in the distance. Faint. Doppler-shifting closer. Then darkness swallowed me.



‚ÄúThe next thing I remembered is waking up in this hospital bed.‚Äù

Sterile light poured down in stripes through the blinds, like prison bars thrown across my blanket. My arms were weak. My lips were dry. My chest felt hollowed out. The first thing I noticed was the cuff‚Äîcold, stainless steel around my right wrist, clipped tight to the bed rail.

‚ÄúWhy the hell am I handcuffed?‚Äù I croaked. My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly a flight risk.‚Äù I gestured vaguely at my legs, draped under the starched hospital blanket. They hadn‚Äôt moved in years. They weren‚Äôt going to start now.

Across the room sat a detective in a charcoal suit. He‚Äôd introduced himself as Detective Hayes. He was a black man, maybe in his late fifties, with silver in his beard and pitted lines around his eyes. He looked like he‚Äôd seen war. Not the loud kind‚Äîthe quiet, domestic kind, the kind that happened in the space between people. He didn‚Äôt have a notepad. Just a thick folder balanced on his knee and a look in his eyes like he was already disappointed in me. He‚Äôd sat there, quietly, listening to me tell my story. 

He held my gaze a beat too long. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre handcuffed to the bed, Ms. Silverstone,‚Äù he said finally, voice level, almost gentle, ‚Äúbecause right now, you‚Äôre the prime suspect in the murder of Thomas Richardson.‚Äù

The words didn‚Äôt land at first. They hovered, floating just outside the room like moths, until suddenly‚Äî

Murder.

The bottom dropped out of my body.

‚ÄúWhat? No. No, no, you *heard* me.‚Äù My breath hitched. ‚ÄúHe stalked me. For *years*. He knew things about me‚Äîthings nobody could‚Äôve known. He impersonated a nurse. He invaded my home. I wasn‚Äôt safe.‚Äù

Detective Hayes blinked slowly. His fingers tapped once against the folder on his lap.¬†

‚ÄúI assure you,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúThomas Richardson was a licensed in-home nurse employed by Pathlight Home Health. The story he told you was accurate. Your care was originally supposed to be handled by a‚Ä¶‚Äù he fumbled, ‚Äúa Shirley Madison, but she had to bow out due to a family emergency. Pathlight assigned Thomas in her place. He‚Äôd only just wrapped up another patient‚Äôs contract across town.‚Äù 

He opened the folder on his knee. Pages inside shifted under his fingers‚Äîpaper, records, photos, time logs. 

‚ÄúBut he knew things about me. Intimate things.‚Äù

He nodded once. ‚ÄúYour mother‚Äôs notes were very thorough. Over forty pages. Detailed meal preferences, emotional triggers, emergency protocols. She even included things you liked to watch on Youtube when you had bad pain flare-ups.‚Äù He gestured toward a stack of folders in a nearby chair, thick as a cinderblock. ‚ÄúShe clearly cared about you a great deal.‚Äù

I blinked at them. The edges of my vision fuzzed like static. ‚ÄúBut he was‚Äîhe was watching me. I caught him pacing outside my bedroom door, kind of‚Ä¶‚Äù

He tilted his head. The corners of his mouth sagged. ‚ÄúYou streamed your final interaction with Mr. Richardson. One of your moderators clipped the entire video. It‚Äôs all timestamped. We have the footage.‚Äù

I nodded, desperate. ‚Äú*See?* He broke into my room. The lock was broken‚Äîhe forced his way in!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat much is true,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut think about it. If this man could slip in and out of your room while you were asleep‚Äîspy on you, as you claim‚Äîthen why would he suddenly need to *break* the door down, with a hallway camera pointed right at him?‚Äù

I opened my mouth. Nothing came out.

‚ÄúCould it be,‚Äù he continued gently, ‚Äúthat he heard you in distress, didn‚Äôt know what was happening inside, and panicked? More so, you say he was pacing around and spying on you in the first few days. He was new to your home and in an unfamiliar environment, he may have simply been finding his way, or checking in on you.‚Äù

I stared past him, into the static noise between the blinds. The sunlight felt too hot. The room too bright.

‚ÄúThe guest room,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúThe shrine. The corkboard. My discord handle. The fucking notebook‚Ä¶‚Äù

His expression barely changed. But I saw it‚Äîthe flicker of something sympathetic in his eyes. Pity. ‚ÄúWe searched the guest room, Sarah. There was nothing like what you described. Just standard paperwork, mostly Pathlight documents. The corkboard was bare. No printouts, no screencaps.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúThere were brown flecks on some of the forms. You insulated that it was dried blood.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He exhaled, like he didn‚Äôt want to say the next part.

‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù

I stared down at my blanket. At the pale blue pattern like frost across the fabric. My hands balled into fists beneath it. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù My voice was barely a whisper now.

He picked up a different folder from beside him and opened it. ‚ÄúThere was a discrepancy in your Pathlight paperwork. Regarding your prescriptions. Your Zyprexa.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúZyprexa,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúThe paperwork your mother filled out states you‚Äôre prescribed 20 mg nightly with food. But Thomas‚Äôs intake paperwork‚Äîwhat he picked up from the pharmacy‚Äîlisted 10 mg. Looks like there was an error when the forms were being transcribed.‚Äù He flipped to a photocopy of the label. Highlighted text. ‚ÄúHe was administering 10 mg pills. Exactly what the bottle said. We found the receipt. He‚Äôd picked them up before your first day together.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSo I got a smaller dose. What, that made me anxious or something? That‚Äôs not enough to explain all of this.‚Äù

He met my eyes dead-on. ‚ÄúNo, Sarah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúZyprexa isn‚Äôt for anxiety. It‚Äôs for managing schizophrenia. Halving your dose could have induced a full psychotic relapse. Including hallucinations. Delusions. Paranoia. Possibly worse than what prompted your initial diagnosis ten years ago.‚Äù

My mouth opened. I tried to respond. Nothing came. The words dissolved before they reached my throat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he added, his voice suddenly so much softer it made my stomach hurt. ‚ÄúI guess your mom never told you. She probably included it with your CMS meds. You never would have noticed. Maybe she wanted to protect you from the stigma.‚Äù¬†

The world was collapsing in on itself. I had schizophrenia? For *ten* years? And now‚Ä¶ now this meant‚Ä¶‚ÄúI killed him,‚Äù I said aloud. Not a question. Just the weight of the truth, arriving at last. ‚ÄúBut he knew the nickname,‚Äù I said, weaker now. ‚ÄúThe quiet spark. He said that to me.‚Äù¬†

He shrugged. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs to say? Maybe you heard it. Maybe you filled in the blanks. That‚Äôs new information, so our people haven‚Äôt had the chance to check his digital footprint for anything that matches that username‚ÄîRainRider, I think it was. But your mother left so many notes pertaining to your care. It‚Äôs possible that she mentioned it‚Äîshe did talk about your streams.‚Äù

Silence. The kind of silence that felt like it might eat me. I stared down at my own hand‚Äîpale against the sheet, cuffed and shaking.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen to me?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my call. You‚Äôll be evaluated. Doctors will review the full file. Right now, all I can say is‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused, searching for something real to say, ‚Äú...you‚Äôve been through something terrible. And you‚Äôre not alone. Whatever happens next, we‚Äôll make sure you get the care you need.‚Äù

But I wasn‚Äôt sure I believed him. Because in that moment‚Äîbeneath fluorescent light, locked to a hospital bed‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel like someone who needed care. I felt like a monster waking up in someone else‚Äôs skin.¬†

The door clicked shut behind him. I lay there in the stale, humming quiet of the hospital room. One wrist still bound to the bedframe. The other curled weakly against my side. Somewhere down the hall, a machine beeped in time with a distant heartbeat. Outside the window, the sky had turned that indifferent shade of hospital gray. The color of lost time.

I stared at the ceiling tiles until they began to shift. Until the patterns rearranged themselves. Until I saw his face in them again.

Or maybe it was mine.

1mh280p,https://i.redd.it/30ao4rru2xgf1.png,Alklyte Can Help You Enjoy Coffee Again Without the Acid Burn: Neutralizing Acidity with Quad/Dual Buffers,"For years, coffee was a double-edged sword‚Äîessential for energy and focus, but almost guaranteed to trigger¬†**reflux**,¬†**stomach discomfort**, or that familiar sour stomach. I tried low-acid beans, cold brew, even mushroom coffee... but nothing worked consistently.

Then I learned that the key isn‚Äôt just the type of coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs¬†**how your body buffers the acid load**¬†that comes with it.

# Why Coffee Is Acidic

Coffee contains a mix of¬†**chlorogenic acids**,¬†**quinic acid**, and other organic compounds that lower the pH of the beverage and contribute to¬†**gastric irritation**, especially in people dealing with:

* GERD / acid reflux
* Gastritis or LPR
* Dietary acidosis
* Kidney stress

The solution isn‚Äôt necessarily giving up coffee. It‚Äôs about¬†**buffering the acidity**¬†both¬†**in the cup**¬†and¬†**in your body**.

# What Alklyte Does Differently

**Alklyte**¬†is a precise blend of specific molar ratios of¬†**bicarbonates (sodium/potassium) and citrates (potassium/sodium). The mix is precisely designed to support a healthy acid-base pH balance.\***

These compounds are the¬†**exact same types of buffers your body naturally produces**¬†to stabilize pH and neutralize acids. When added to coffee (or taken with water before/after drinking), Alklyte:

* **Neutralizes the free hydrogen ions**¬†(acid) in the coffee directly
* **Provides systemic buffering support**¬†that reduces the total dietary acid load
* Helps protect the¬†**gut lining**¬†and¬†**kidneys**¬†from chronic acid stress

It‚Äôs not just about raising the pH of the coffee itself‚Äîit‚Äôs about improving the way your¬†**entire body handles acidity**¬†after consumption.

# Real-World Impact

Since using Alklyte, I‚Äôve gone back to enjoying coffee without fear of flare-ups. I don‚Äôt rely on PPIs or chalky antacids anymore. Just a scoop of Alklyte stirred into my morning coffee or taken in a glass of water beforehand has made all the difference.

And the science backs this up.¬†**Citrate and bicarbonate salts**¬†have been shown to:

* Reduce symptoms of¬†**GERD and reflux**
* Improve¬†**acid-base balance**¬†possibly helping those with chronic kidney disease (ask your doctor first before using if you have CKD because it contains some potassium)
* Support¬†**gut barrier function**¬†and microbial balance
* Help reduce¬†**dietary acidosis**¬†linked to fatigue, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction (see recent posts in this group for peer-reviewed studies)

# Takeaway

You don‚Äôt have to give up coffee to feel good‚Äîyou just need a better buffering strategy. For me, that‚Äôs¬†**Alklyte**.

1mh27fm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh27fm,"Jacques- Utrecht, Netherlands üá≥üá±","A few weeks ago, I got to spend some time in the Netherlands and check out the caf√© scene. One place I stumbled upon was ‚ÄúJacques‚Äù in Utrecht. What initially pulled me in was the selection of beans on the wall. My primary interest was to buy beans from my travels and bring them back to the USA. As I entered, I was greeted with a great big smile from the barista. He was eager to be of help when I was asking about the bean selection. After some time, I went with a couple of bags of RumBaba as I had never heard of them before and was intrigued by the varieties and mainly, tasting notes. 
The barista asked if I‚Äôd like a drink on the house; after all, I was spending good money on the beans! I said, ‚ÄúMake me whatever you‚Äôre most excited to make.‚Äù He pulled a bag of beans out from his personal collection. A roaster from Ukraine called ‚ÄúPenyora‚Äù. A wonderful cup with top notes of citrus. The conversations we had about our respective caf√© cultures and passion for coffee were awesome and inspiring, knowing that coffee can transcend culture, people, countries, and politics‚Äî especially in this day and age. If you find yourself in the area, I highly recommend going to Jacques. And if you are a serious coffee person, stay tuned for my next post about Bankai, which is located right around the corner.",7,1754276065.0,pourover,0,0.89,False

I just noticed a Creatista Pro pop up on marketplace for $200 (Canadian), and I am so tempted to buy it. I do understand it is not going to give me a regular large cup of coffee that I am typically used to, and I know the vertuo doesn‚Äôt do true espresso.

Admittedly, I wouldn‚Äôt be looking to buy a separate espresso machine if it wasn‚Äôt for this great deal.  I do think i would likely drink more lattes if it was a quicker process than using the aerrocino, and if i find some great pods for americanos, i‚Äôd certainly make use of that function on a regular basis as well.

You call a locksmith.
 You make him believe you live at your neighbor‚Äôs address. He makes you a copy of the keys.

 Every time your neighbor leaves his apartment, you sneak in and place a whole pineapple somewhere random in his home.

Every day‚Ä¶ a new pineapple.

You slowly become friends with him. 
You tell him you also receive pineapples at your place. 
He talks about his job. 
You start anonymously sending pineapples to his workplace. 
Of course he brings it up with you...

You become even closer friends.
 You show him the pineapples you‚Äôve ""received"" too.
 You even help him file a police report!
You tell him you're going to install cameras in the hallway ‚Äî just to get ahead of him before he does it himself.

You tell him you love him!

You start dating!

He introduces you to his parents and friends.

 Now you know where they live.

You spy on his parents and his friends. 

You memorize the times they leave and come home.

 You start placing pineapples at their places too.

Now that you‚Äôre dating your neighbor, you know what he does in his free time ‚Äî when and where he goes for activities.

You just have to get there before him, and drop a pineapple everywhere he goes.

In his gym locker, the pool, the park bench where he jogs. 

...At his favorite coffee shop. At the bar‚Ä¶

You're dating him...so..
He will never suspect you.

Then‚Ä¶ the downward spiral begins.

You tell him you can't keep the relationship going ‚Äî that you don‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs ready to commit. 

He spirals even further.

 But he still won‚Äôt suspect you‚Ä¶ because why would he? You were there for him. You helped him through this terrifying pineapple ordeal.

1mh20fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mh20fp/the_inheritance_of_castle_nyvahn_part_1/,The Inheritance of Castle Nyvahn (Part 1),"I‚Äôm no one special, at least I was until this morning.¬†

I live alone in a small flat on the second floor overlooking the river here in Uppsala. It‚Äôs an old building, its bricks faded and rough with age. Every morning when I open the window, the sharp scent of cold water and moss drifts in. My life is quiet, ordered in a way that sometimes feels more like isolation.¬†

I‚Äôm a historian by trade; a lecturer at a small university, specializing in early Scandinavian history and language. It‚Äôs a world of kings and bloodlines that most people have either forgotten or never cared about. My work is meticulous but invisible: papers that gather dust in journals, lectures that echo in halls filled with bored students, and afternoons lost in the musty silence of archives.

At forty-three, I have no family of my own. No wife, no children. Friends are few and far between, drifting in and out of my life like leaves in the wind. Instead, I keep myself company with long walks in the winter dusk, a steaming cup of dark roast coffee, and the slow scratch of pen on paper as I transcribe old texts. It‚Äôs not loneliness, I tell myself, it's a choice. Order in chaos. But sometimes, that order feels like a cage.

Then the letter came. It arrived on a bitterly cold morning, slipped under my door without ceremony. I hardly noticed it at first, just another piece of mail in the heap. But when I picked it up, I knew immediately something was different. The envelope was thick, the paper old-fashioned and rough, sealed with cracked red wax stamped with a strange emblem I didn‚Äôt recognize. The postmark was from a small, rural municipality far to the north, near the Norwegian border‚Äîplaces I only knew from maps.

My name was written across the front in black ink. Not ‚ÄúProfessor Lorne,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDr. Erik Lorne.‚Äù Just:

‚ÄúErik. For the last of the blood.‚Äù

I stared at the words for a long time. The handwriting was uneven, almost trembling.

Curiosity pried my fingers open, and I tore the envelope.

Inside was a letter‚Äîa legal notice, formal and cold. It informed me that an estate called Nyhavn Castle had passed into my possession following the death of its last caretaker, a certain Baron Sigvard Nyhavn. A name that meant nothing to me.

I read the letter twice, thrice. It included maps, property documents, and genealogical charts with my name scrawled at the bottom of a long family tree. A bloodline I never knew I belonged to. Me, the baron of an ancient castle? It was absurd. A story that belonged in a fairy tale, not reality.

Yet, something about it stuck with me. A name I‚Äôd never heard, a place that I didn‚Äôt know existed. I told myself it wasn‚Äôt worth the trouble. Still, I brought it up casually with a few colleagues, curious if anyone had come across Nyhavn Castle in their research. No one had. Not even the Scandinavian specialists. Most gave polite shrugs or assumed it was a mistranslation.

Only one of them, Professor Loken, a retired comparative religion scholar with a long memory, offered something useful. He frowned when I mentioned the name.

‚ÄúI think there was a tribe up that way,‚Äù he said, voice hoarse with age. ‚ÄúNorthern interior. Pre-Christian, deeply isolated. Supposedly worshipped something tied to the land. Not a god in the usual sense, more like a spirit or presence, but the records are scattered. Oral tradition mostly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs just a rumor?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúAt this point, everything up there is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhatever it was, it got buried. Either by time or by someone‚Äôs intention.‚Äù

That stuck with me more than I expected.

Over the next few days, I found myself digging deeper. I scoured land records, old maps, scattered mentions in 18th- and 19th-century travelogues. Nothing concrete. Nyhavn Castle didn‚Äôt appear in any official registry. No census data. No coordinates. It was as if the place had been deliberately erased.

The deeper I looked, the more deliberate the silence felt. Like the castle had been removed, not lost.

By the end of the week, I‚Äôd cleared my teaching schedule and filed for sabbatical. I told the department I was following up on an obscure archival lead from the early modern period, which technically wasn‚Äôt a lie. A few raised their eyebrows, but most didn‚Äôt ask. Historians vanish into weird rabbit holes all the time.

I packed lightly: journals, a handful of reference books, sturdy clothes for the cold. Alongside that was a camera. It would be worth my while, as a historian, to catalogue any information and photographs I could glean from this expedition.

The only truly personal item I brought with me was an old pocket watch. It had been mine since childhood. A quiet, weighty gift from my father that I never quite understood. The casing was dull silver, scuffed with age, and etched into its back was a strange symbol: two curved diagonals, crossing like sickles or broken wings, with a hollow circle set just beneath the intersection. The circle bled slightly at the bottom. Not with color or corrosion, but with a fine, deliberate engraving, like something was seeping from it. The narrow trail extended downward, tapering off like a drip of water. I‚Äôd never seen it referenced in any historical record or esoteric text, no matter how much I‚Äôd looked. Still, I kept the watch with me.¬†

At the airport, snow drifted softly across the tarmac. I caught my reflection in the glass and thought I looked older than I felt. The planes and people buzzed with urgency around me, but I was oddly detached, as if I were moving through a shadow.

As the plane lifted through the pale gray sky, leaving the city and its familiar streets behind, I felt something I hadn‚Äôt felt in years: a faint, inexplicable recognition. Not excitement. Not fear. Something older. It was like coming home.

The plane landed at Troms√∏ Regional Airport just around noon, the sun hidden by cold, gray clouds. The terminal was modest but functional, the low hum of announcements echoing faintly. I waited by the baggage claim, clutching the folder of documents that had brought me here.

A man approached‚Äîa clean-cut, middle-aged fellow in a navy suit. He smiled politely and held a card with my name taped to a folder.

‚ÄúMr. Lorne? I‚Äôm Henrik Dahl. I‚Äôm from the law firm handling the Nyhavn estate.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect anyone to see me here, but thank you for showing up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. It‚Äôs not every day we have a new heir show up.‚Äù

We stepped outside and loaded my bags into a black sedan parked curbside. The air was crisp and cold, the faint scent of pine hanging in the breeze.

As Henrik started the engine, I asked, ‚ÄúSo, how did I come to inherit the castle exactly? I never even knew about the Nyhavn family.‚Äù

Henrik glanced over, his tone matter-of-fact. ‚ÄúThe law firm did some extensive genealogy research when the last baron passed away. It turns out your father was adopted, but they managed to trace his birth lineage back to the Nyhavn family.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúSo that makes me the next heir?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. The bloodline has thinned considerably, and with no direct descendants, the inheritance is passed to you.‚Äù

We drove out of the airport, the roads winding through forested hills and sparse farmland.

Henrik continued, ‚ÄúThe castle itself is quite old, dating back several centuries. Locals have their share of stories and rumors about it. Nothing verified, just folklore. The usual things about old noble families and their secrets.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúAnything in particular?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing concrete. Mostly tales passed down: ghost stories, superstitions about the forest. It‚Äôs common in rural areas to have legends like that. The Nyhavn name carries some weight around here, but it‚Äôs mostly history now.‚Äù

The landscape shifted as we left paved roads behind, gravel crunching beneath the tires. The castle appeared on a ridge ahead. A looming, crumbling silhouette laid against the sky.

‚ÄúIt looks... impressive.‚Äù

Henrik smiled. ‚ÄúIt is. And isolated. The village nearby is small, quiet. The people there know the history but tend not to dwell on it.‚Äù

We approached a cluster of modest houses with smoke rising from chimneys. ‚ÄúThis is Hollowby. You‚Äôll find lodging at the inn.‚Äù

I asked, ‚ÄúWill someone be there to help me settle in?‚Äù

‚ÄúIngrid will be your point of contact,‚Äù Henrik replied. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs well-regarded, knows the area, and can help you get acquainted.‚Äù

He handed me an envelope. ‚ÄúInside are the keys and some documents. They might give you some insight into the place.‚Äù

As we pulled up to the inn, the soft glow of candlelight spilled from frosted windows.

Henrik glanced at me with a friendly nod. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, the firm‚Äôs local office can assist. Otherwise, good luck with your new estate.‚Äù

I watched the sedan disappear down the road, leaving me standing on the edge of a quiet village under the growing night sky, a stranger inheriting a legacy I barely understood.

Regardless, I stepped onto the inn‚Äôs creaky porch. It was an old building, low and squat, its steep roof sagging under the weight of snow that hadn‚Äôt yet fallen but threatened in the air.¬† Inside, the common room smelled of pine resin and ale. The heavy wooden beams overhead were blackened with age, and a stone hearth dominated one wall where a small fire struggled against the cold. A handful of villagers sat around tables, nursing mugs and speaking in low tones.

I scanned the room, and my eyes settled on a young woman, perhaps in her mid-twenties, behind the bar. She was blonde, with sharp green eyes and a quiet composure that set her apart. She moved with practiced ease, wiping down the counter as though she‚Äôd done it a thousand times before.

She caught my gaze and approached with a tentative smile. ‚ÄúYou must be the baron,‚Äù she said softly.

‚ÄúI suppose I am,‚Äù I replied, smiling back, though I felt anything but noble.

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Ingrid,‚Äù she said, extending a hand. ‚ÄúI live here. I‚Äôll help you get settled.‚Äù

There was something in her voice, a mixture of warmth and caution, that made me want to trust her, even though I barely knew her.

After settling into my room and setting my suitcase by the radiator, I stepped out with a camera slung over one shoulder and my notebook tucked under one arm. The drive was long, and the light was already fading, but I didn‚Äôt want to waste a moment of it. A half-forgotten village connected to an old Scandinavian castle, this was exactly the kind of oddity I lived for. The historian in me felt like a crow set loose in ruins made of gold.

Hollowby was quiet in the late afternoon. Snow dusted the rooftops and narrow lanes, and the smell of smoke drifted from unseen chimneys. The streets felt paused, like the whole village had taken a breath and hadn‚Äôt let it out yet.

As I rounded a corner near the edge of the village, I spotted an older man sitting on a weathered porch, bundled in a thick wool coat, a knit cap pulled low over his ears. He smoked a pipe, the bowl glowing orange in the dusky light. His eyes flicked toward me as I passed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one they brought in?‚Äù he said, his voice gravelly, accent thick but clear.

‚ÄúI suppose so,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúErik. Just taking a look around before it gets dark.‚Äù

He gave a noncommittal grunt and took another pull from the pipe. ‚ÄúYou got the castle, then?‚Äù

I stopped and turned to face him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Apparently I‚Äôm next in line.‚Äù

He stared at me a moment, then let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get many blood folk anymore.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúBlood folk?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe old lines,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe ones tied to the land. You might not know it, but folks used to say your family kept this place from falling in on itself. Old ways. Old debts.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like a fairytale,‚Äù I said, half-joking.

He didn‚Äôt laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the young ones say too. But things don‚Äôt forget, not in places like this. The land keeps score, even if the people don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of debts are we talking about?‚Äù I asked, more curious than concerned.

The man tapped ash from his pipe into a tin can beside his chair. ‚ÄúSacrifices. Oaths. You know how stories go. Feed the land, and it feeds you. Stop feeding it, and‚Ä¶ well. Things start drying up. Crops, bloodlines, the like‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like something you tell kids to scare them.‚Äù

He chuckled, dry, like leaves scraping a window. ‚ÄúNo one tells kids anything anymore. That‚Äôs the problem.‚Äù

Before I could respond, he nodded past me. ‚ÄúThere she is. Ingrid‚Äôll tell you the rest, if she feels like it.‚Äù

I turned to see her walking toward me from the other end of the path, hands buried in her coat pockets. When I turned back, the old man was already rising, disappearing through his front door with a creak.

‚ÄúMade a friend?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúJust met him,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Mr. Nystr√∂m. Don‚Äôt worry about him, he talks like that to everyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúCryptically?‚Äù

‚ÄúConstantly.‚Äù

She noted my notebook and camera, and then gestured for me to follow. ‚ÄúCome on. If you‚Äôre going to write about this place, you might as well see the parts people pretend aren‚Äôt here.‚Äù

We wandered through Hollowby as the light dipped lower. The village seemed to tilt backward in time with each step. Dark timber houses, soot-caked chimneys, shuttered windows sealed tight. A few curious eyes peeked out from behind lace curtains, vanishing when noticed.

We arrived at a small chapel at the far end of the village, its stone walls mottled with moss and time. The roof sagged slightly, and a row of crooked gravestones leaned like teeth outside its gate.

‚ÄúStill hold services here?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNow and then,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut most folks stopped coming after the priest died.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that?‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúFolks here just don‚Äôt believe that much in God, I guess.‚Äù

We walked a few steps more, then she stopped and tilted her head. ‚ÄúYou want to see something strange?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd never ask.‚Äù

She led me into the chapel. Inside, it was dim and cold, the scent of old wood and dry stone hanging in the air. The pews were narrow and worn, the crucifix above the altar dark with soot. A single stained-glass window filtered the dying light into fractured reds and blues.

Ingrid moved to the back wall and knelt beside a section of paneling near the floor. With a practiced hand, she pried it open to reveal a narrow stairwell leading downward into shadow.

‚ÄúIs this where you keep the good wine?‚Äù I asked.

She smirked. ‚ÄúNot exactly.‚Äù

The air turned damp and cold as we descended. The stone steps groaned beneath our feet. At the bottom, we stepped into a small chamber more primitive than sacred. The walls were rough stone, lined with looping carvings ‚Äî spirals, twisted limbs, antler-like branches. In the center, a scorched pit of stone ringed with long-dead embers.

‚ÄúThis was here before the church,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBefore Hollowby, even. The village was built around it.‚Äù

‚ÄúA shrine?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSome say. Others say it was a gate.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo what?‚Äù

She gave me a quick glance. ‚ÄúThe forest. The old spirits. They gave offerings here. Mostly animals‚Ä¶ but sometimes people, when things got bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuman sacrifices?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the stories say. A drought, a plague, a death in the noble line‚Ä¶ and someone would be taken. Sent into the woods, or sometimes the castle.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt actually believe that, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe it mattered to them. And maybe that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

There was something about the room that made me uneasy. Not overtly sinister, but heavy, like it had seen too much and told too little.

We climbed back into the chapel, Ingrid sealing the panel behind us. Outside, the sky had fully darkened, the snow falling in a slow, steady curtain.

As we walked back toward the inn, I paused. Something moved near the treeline. A shape, large and slow, slipping between the trunks.

A bear, I thought at first, but it looked bigger than that. Taller. Broad across the back.

‚ÄúIngrid,‚Äù I said quietly, pointing.

She followed my gaze. ‚ÄúOne of the forest bears,‚Äù she said casually. ‚ÄúThey come down sometimes looking for scraps.‚Äù

I watched it until it vanished into the trees. It didn‚Äôt seem in a hurry.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got big bears around here,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúThey always seem bigger when you‚Äôre alone. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm with you,‚Äù she said, giving me a smile.

We walked the rest of the way in silence. At the inn, she turned to me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the stories get in your head,‚Äù she said.

I nodded, though I already knew they had.

The next morning, after a dreamless night, I met Ingrid again. She brought fresh bread and stew. Over breakfast, she seemed more relaxed.

‚ÄúYou look tired,‚Äù she said, her green eyes searching mine.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sleep well,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúThis place has a way of getting under your skin.‚Äù

She nodded knowingly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get used to it.‚Äù

As I finished the last of the bread, the kitchen door creaked open and an elderly woman stepped in, wiping her hands on a flour-dusted apron. Her silver hair was braided down her back, and she moved with the quiet, firm efficiency of someone who had been running things long before anyone thought to help her.

‚ÄúSo this is the castle man,‚Äù she said, eyes flicking toward me with something between curiosity and amusement.

‚ÄúGrandmother,‚Äù Ingrid muttered, her voice tight. ‚ÄúThis is Erik.‚Äù

The old woman gave me a warm smile and nodded, ‚ÄúMarta. I run the inn. Ingrid‚Äôs mine. I raised her after her parents passed.‚Äù

I stood, out of habit, and offered a hand, but she waved it off with a flick of her wrist. ‚ÄúNo need for that. Sit. Eat. You‚Äôll need strength for that castle.‚Äù

I half-smiled and returned to my seat. ‚ÄúNice to meet you. You have a beautiful place here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm. Still standing, anyway.‚Äù Marta gave me a slow once-over. ‚ÄúAnd you. Well, you clean up well for someone dragged out of nowhere to inherit stone and ghosts.‚Äù

‚ÄúMormor‚Ä¶‚Äù Ingrid warned.

‚ÄúTall, quiet, polite. Bet you‚Äôd make strong children. Isn‚Äôt that right Ingrid?‚Äù she said, looking teasingly at her granddaughter.

I choked slightly on my stew. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect a matchmaking pitch with breakfast.‚Äù

Ingrid looked mortified. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs joking. Ignore her.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù Marta said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about husbands anymore. It‚Äôs about roots. This place needs roots again. Strong ones.‚Äù

I looked between the two of them, unsure whether to laugh or be unnerved. Marta didn‚Äôt strike me as senile, if anything, she seemed sharper than either of us.¬†

She turned to Ingrid again, her tone softening, but only slightly. ‚ÄúThings are moving now, girl. Best not be caught standing still.‚Äù

Then she gave me one last nod and shuffled back into the kitchen, humming low and tuneless under her breath.

Ingrid stared down at her bowl. Her voice was quieter when she finally spoke. ‚ÄúShe means well.‚Äù

Before I could say anything, the tavern door creaked open. A handful of the village‚Äôs elders entered, settling around the corner table near the fireplace. Most of them looked well into their seventies, bundled in heavy wool, their hands gnarled with time.

They spoke softly, but I caught fragments: names I didn‚Äôt recognize, and a dialect I couldn‚Äôt place. Their voices felt like the wind through dry leaves. Whispering, low, urgent. When they noticed me looking, the conversation halted altogether.

Ingrid walked to my side, slipping on her coat.¬†

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you up to the castle.‚Äù

The Familiar ‚Äì Part One 

The first time I saw him, it was a Friday evening.
I opened the door, and he was stuck to the ceiling‚Äîarms and legs spread like a spider‚Äîstaring at me with bulging, blood-red eyes.

Strangely, I wasn‚Äôt afraid. It felt like I had known him forever.
Like he was no more surprising than a housecat I‚Äôd had for years.
From that day on, he was always with me.
In the car. On the street. At the office.
He‚Äôd appear out of nowhere, sometimes even arriving before me.
I knew no one else could see him.

He was a strange, imaginary creature.
A triple-pronged tail, long leathery tongue, rough skin like horn, clawed fingers.
Not scary, exactly‚Äîmore absurd. Laughable, even.

His size changed constantly‚Äîsometimes as small as a mouse, sometimes as big as a crocodile.
Once, I saw him shrunk down, hanging from the chandelier like a bat, watching TV.
His shadow on the wall startled me at first‚Ä¶ but then I saw him and couldn‚Äôt help laughing.
He didn‚Äôt like that.

He immediately leapt onto the coffee table, grew into a giant lizard, and glared at me like he was offended.

Up until yesterday, I‚Äôd never seen him eat anything.
But yesterday, through the restaurant window, I saw him leap off my car hood, reach into a filthy gutter, and pull out a fat rat.
He held it up, studied it curiously, and then stuffed it sideways into his mouth......

Here‚Äôs how to narrow it down like a pro:

 

1. Size Matters (But It‚Äôs Not One-Size-Fits-All)

 

Your coffee table should leave enough space to move around your sofa (aim for 18‚Äì24 inches between them). A good rule? It should be 2/3 the length of your sofa (or the longest piece of seating) to keep proportions balanced. Too small = lost surface space; too big = awkward traffic jams.

 

2. Shape Shifts with Your Room

 

\- Rectangular: Best for long sofas or open layouts‚Äîmaximizes surface area.

\- Round/Oval: Perfect for small spaces or families with kids (no sharp corners!).

\- Square: Works great with sectionals orÂØπÁß∞ (symmetrical) setups.

 

3. Height = Comfort First

 

Aim for a table that‚Äôs 1‚Äì2 inches lower than your sofa cushions. Too short, and you‚Äôll be hunching to grab your drink; too tall, and it‚Äôll feel like a barrier.

 

4. Material = Lifestyle Match

 

\- Wood: Timeless, warm, but avoid super porous woods if you have messy eaters (opt for sealed finishes!).

\- Glass/Metal: Sleek and modern, but glass shows fingerprints‚Äîgreat for low-maintenance households.

\- Marble/Stone: Luxe, but heavy and prone to stains (use coasters religiously!).

\- Wicker/Rattan: Casual and cozy, ideal for boho or coastal vibes‚Äîjust keep it away from heavy spills.

 

5. Storage = Bonus Points (If You Need It)

 

\- Drawers/Shelves: Perfect for stashing remotes, magazines, or kids‚Äô toys.

\- ottom Storage: Great for blankets or extra pillows‚Äîkeeps things tidy but accessible.",1,1754275035.0,u_TRIUMPHQWE,0,1.0,False

I had just started my lunch break when I squeezed through the gap in the chain link fence, cut through the trees, and found the water.

That‚Äôs when I heard a disturbing sound come from the bushes. 

Ka-crack.

It sounded like something being ripped apart, like bones or‚Ä¶

Ka-crack. 

I knelt behind a tree. Glanced over my surroundings to witness ‚Äî

‚Äî Something huge framed between two pines. Hunched over its prey in mid-feast.

I couldn‚Äôt tell what it was, but it had horns, a long snout, and an arched back like it had endured years of hard labor. 

Whatever it was, it was feasting on something‚Ä¶ 

I remained frozen, completely shocked by what I was seeing.

It wasn‚Äôt a grizzly bear‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶ or a mountain lion.

Ka-crack. Ka-crack. 

The animal devoured its catch, ravenous. 

I waited several seconds, then crept away, careful to not make any noise. 

I‚Äôd barely crawled out from the fence when I heard ‚Äî

‚ÄúWhat are you doing in there?‚Äù

I spun around and saw ‚Äî 

‚Äî Ralph, my cranky war veteran neighbor. He was still in his bathrobe and slippers, sipping a mug of coffee.¬†¬†

‚ÄúRalph!‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúI saw something‚Ä¶ in the woods‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be back there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI know, but‚Ä¶ it was‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúBig like a bear?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHunched over?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh!‚Äù

‚ÄúHad horns?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúWhat you saw was the Jabber. Don‚Äôt ever go back there. If it knows you‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôll hunt you down and kill you.‚Äù

What?!

Ralph shoved past me and continued on his walk. 

I was so shocked. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. 

On my way back home, I wondered, Did that really happen? What was that animal? Why did Ralph know so much about it?

***

That afternoon I paced in my living room, contemplating Ralph‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúIf it knows you‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôll hunt you down and kill you.‚Äù 

I tried to remember what he called it: The Jabber!

But what was a Jabber?

I remembered the stories from my childhood, a legend forced on us kids to make us compliant. 

I rushed to my office. Started searching online. 

I was shocked to see thousands of gruesome, horrifying pictures. Each in some way looked like a cross between a wolf and a wendigo.

Beneath one photo was the text: ‚ÄúOld Wintu Legend.‚Äù 

This specific picture looked like the creature I saw. But it couldn‚Äôt be possible. 

These things weren‚Äôt real, right?

***

The next morning, I visited the historical society. I wanted to ask the owners about this animal. 

The place was run by an old Wintu named White Horn. I found him in the back organizing books.

‚ÄúExcuse me, sir.‚Äù I said, trying not to appear desperate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for information on an old Wintu legend.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, yes. Very popular subject.‚Äù White Horn set down his book. ‚ÄúWhich legend?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Jabber.‚Äù

As soon as the words left my mouth, his eyes narrowed: ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ Jabber?‚Äù

His eyes turned cold, with an expression more serious than death.

‚ÄúDid it see you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes it know you‚Äôre looking for it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so ‚Äî‚Äù 

He shoved me to the door.

‚ÄúWait ‚Äî I want to know ‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúGo home and pray it never finds you.‚Äù

BAM. He shut the door after me, flipped the sign to ‚ÄúClosed.‚Äù

***

That night, while saut√©ing dinner and ruminating over the day‚Äôs events, I heard my sliding door open.

Ka-creak.

My body tensed. I reached for a knife. 

Ka-creak.

I poked my head into the living room.

It was Ralph. 

‚ÄúRalph, what are you ‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down.‚Äù¬†¬†

He had a shotgun in his arms. 

‚ÄúWhy do you have a gun?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI need to tell you something.‚Äù 

We moved into the garage. Ralph made sure the door was locked and the windows covered. He spoke in frightened whispers, like he‚Äôd been keeping a secret for years and was about to explode. 

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to say cannot leave this room. Understand?‚Äù

I nodded vigorously. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the thing you saw.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúYears ago, this place used to be Wintu country. When the White Man came and drove the people away, something evil took their place.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Jabber?‚Äù

Just hearing the name made Ralph flinch. 

‚ÄúThis creature lives in the woods. It‚Äôs a manifestation of the Wintu‚Äôs hate. If you‚Äôre lucky, it‚Äôll move on to the next wilderness area before it realizes you‚Äôve seen it. Just make sure you don‚Äôt tell anyone about it. The monster demands secrecy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why no one talks about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone who does ends up dead. If the Jabber knows you‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it hurt you?‚Äù

Ralph smirked and lifted his shirt to expose a nasty scar. ‚ÄúIt tried once. But I gave it a headache it never forgot.‚Äù 

He tapped the shotgun at his side. 

‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs the real secret.‚Äù

He pulled a purple crystal out of his pocket.

‚ÄúAn old friend gave me this. It wards off evil spirits.‚Äù 

He offered it to me. 

‚ÄúI keep them all over the house. Seems like you‚Äôll be needing some now.‚Äù

*** 

After we finished talking, I let Ralph out the back. He pressed a finger to his lips.

‚ÄúRemember, stay quiet. We don‚Äôt need any more problems in the community.‚Äù

Any more problems? I thought: How has this thing lived here for so long? How have I just now seen it?¬†¬†

Ralph waved goodbye and meandered down the street. 

I watched him disappear, then returned to my kitchen, finished dinner, and got ready for bed. 

Around 10 PM, I heard a blood-chilling scream. Then, a gunshot.

I raced outside to find ‚Äî 

‚Äî neighbors scrambling up and down our street.

I swiveled my gaze to each house. 

Then I saw it. An ambulance parked outside Ralph‚Äôs place.

I rushed over to June, my next door neighbor. She was clutching her chest, petrified beyond belief.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened. I heard Ralph rambling about something, then he shot himself.‚Äù 

I noticed she was wearing a necklace with a large purple crystal. An amethyst.

I reached into my pocket. Pulled out the gem Ralph had given me‚Ä¶

Coroners emerged from Ralph‚Äôs house, pushing a cart with a body bag. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I had just talked with him.¬†He didn‚Äôt seem suicidal.

After consoling June, I crept back into my driveway, mortified. 

I glanced back at Ralph‚Äôs house, sorrow filling my lungs. 

I could see something on the roof, almost hidden in the shadows ‚Äî

I could barely make it out, but I swear ‚Äî

‚Äî it had large horns, a hunched back, and a long snout.

**You Can‚Äôt Out-Hustle a Broken System**

I won‚Äôt sugarcoat what this means for restaurant professionals, you either get in front of this collapse, or it‚Äôll eat you alive. Here‚Äôs what survival looks like:

* **Consider A Service Fee:**¬†It isn‚Äôt a solution, but it lays your cards on the table. Some Ballard caf√©s are banking on 10‚Äì15% service charges and telling their staff how that gets split. It‚Äôs honest. Customers respect straight talk.

* **Protect Your People:**¬†Find ways to build loyalty that aren‚Äôt tied to guilt-trips at the bill. Building their skill set with them, sane schedules, actual breaks, a shift meal that‚Äôs more than fries and soda, this keeps your best alive.

**Stories Behind the Numbers: Every Struggle, Every Shift**

The numbers carry heartbreak if you listen. Every percent lost is a missed phone bill, another bartender covering someone‚Äôs gas money. You can feel the pain in the open tabs at The Atlantic Crossing on Roosevelt or the nervous glances exchanged behind closed kitchen doors after Sunday brunches when the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù crowds tip half what they used to^(2).

This is the brutal bottom line, no one is coming to save you. Not the apps, not a better point-of-sale system, the new no tax on tips up to $25,000. As always, only those who fight, clear-eyed and unflinching, will make it through.

Ask yourself, both hands in the well and both feet behind the bar: Are you ready to do what it takes to stand tall in the ruins of the old tipping gospel? Because the new math is here, and it‚Äôs merciless.

Auto loans, mortgages, checking/savings, CDs, Credit cards, and more. But their service and website functionality has been going out the window the past few years and it is not getting any better.

I have been directly lied to, not a misunderstanding, by supervisors and MSRs regarding vehicle titles, and given incorrect information on multiple issues. The website is constantly having problems with money transfers, transaction history, balance transfers, etc. And it seems like every other day they are changing something before the other stuff is fixed. I've also had their fraud system kick in for asinine stuff yet someone managed to rack up over $3,000 in gas station casino transactions across the country from where I live. They fixed it, but when my $7 coffee gets declined for fraud its pretty annoying.

I have genuinely gone from a NFCU fanboy to really wanting to switch banks, but many of the features are hard to find. USAA's rates SUCK comparatively, but it may be worth it for the better service but I am obviously hesitant for a repeat. What other options are people in the same boat considering/have had luck with? Not looking for ""advertisements"" but how the competition stacks up.

This is part rant but also a genuine plea for help for others who have left due to the ongoing issues and lack of Member focused care. I don't care how good your experience currently is with them, I have been with them for a long time and have seen the sad decline and very much experienced it. I have a LOT with NF. I also know they aren't the worst bank (credit union) in the world but when you don't have access to branches, online servicing and not spending hours on the phone is kind of important.

Edit: verbiage and clarity

Info:  
I have had 2 mortgages, 3 Car loans, 2 personal loans, a Savings loan, 7 checking/savings/CDs and 3 Credit Cards with NF. Never missed a payment, a six figure credit limit between the 3 cards, and 5 figure savings. When I say a lot, I mean it. It is just funny to me that many of these issues didn't start until just a few years ago and many seem to be dismissing it because they don't actually use the banking services and maybe have a checking and savings.",0,1754274876.0,NavyFederal,10,0.25,False

Well the still is rocking along, despite my broken hydrometer. Lessons have been learned today.

Well my primary lesson is that the 300g of chili pequins I foraged are NOT in fact chili pequins. They are Chiltepins, AKA ""The mother of all peppers"". It's an ancestral strain who's DNA is found in over 70% of all the pepper strains in the world. From bell jalapeno, habanero, etc.

These imparted a peppery lactic acid bite on the top of the pallet while the persimmons come through as a rich body. Apologies if my notes and verbiage are as infantile as my experience distilling. 

I'm still getting notes of warm chocolate and coffee. This is why I made the first batch into a coffee infused spicy salted caramel shine. Only doing 1 pass and just rough cutting the heads out in 1 split. Will keep everything else married until I taste wet cardboard. Then I'm gonna run until I can't taste the still nectar anymore.

Now, we ride! *Gazes fondly at the drip*

I sleep 8-9 hours in winter. Now I always wake up tired and cannot go back to sleep. I tried everything, GABA, sleep mask (heated and not heated, heated one does help me fall asleep faster but not stay asleep obviously), ear plugs (don't think that's the problem, and they start to feel uncomfortable in the morning so they wake me up too). I use the AC on a low setting with a comfortable temperature. I usually make the room cold, turn it off then let it auto-turn on after a few hours.

I'm so tired of always waking up tired and it's really early. I drink coffee only in the morning and only one. I tried doing only decaf but I feel so groggy. I tried sleep meds from the drugstore but they make me aggressive and irritated somehow. At this point I'm just wondering if it is what it is and sleep is hard to come by in the summer months... maybe I need to eat more in summer because I feel hungry in the morning but I doubt that's really it as I'm not losing weight or anything.

# Info: 

I'm moving into this apartment and I have no clue how to set up the living room. The **2d floor plan above is the mirrored version** of the unit we are moving to. The  **virtual walkthrough is the same orientation** as the unit we are moving to. [virtual walkthrough](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=VTdzGEAe6AH)

# What I have:

Furniture wise will only will be brining our 60"" TV ( w/ swivel mount but still have the legs too), a large coffee table (24"" x 46"" \[60cmx115cm\]) and a entertainment console (58""x12ish\[145cmx30cm\]). We were originally hoping to keep our couch a few more months before replacing but our current couch is L shaped (9'x 7'6"" \[275cmx225 cm\] ) so that if we put it on the windowless wall the shorter chaise piece would touch the diagonal wall so well probably get rid of it and do a couch/ loveseat or chair combo. We LAO have some various decor and plantstands that may go in here or another room 

# My thoughts:

I thought the tv would go on the diagonal wall initially but I'm thinking it would be an awkward viewing angle and I wouldn't swivel it out every time I use it. The other option would be tv on the windowless wall and floating couch on the opposite side though I'm not sure if that will block or make awkward walk ways

I of course don't want to block the windows.  They are north facing  so I won't be getting much light but  will likely have some low light plants over here.

üìç**Location: Back Home ‚Äì Chaos Headquarters**  
üïó**Time: 9:15 PM, same night**

# Scene: After Dinner‚Ä¶ but Before the Breakdown

(The gang is full from Harley‚Äôs ‚Äúliberated‚Äù cupcakes and Nicole‚Äôs emergency grilled cheese therapy session. Julia and Alina are curled up on the couch in coordinated crop tops, still recovering. Shotzi is showing Alina videos of Kelly yelling at random objects from earlier. Harley‚Äôs busy trying to give the microwave a nickname. Kelly, however‚Ä¶ has moved on from furniture arguments. She‚Äôs now in the laundry room.)

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Kelly?‚Äù

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúI think she said she was going to ‚Äòinterrogate the dryer.‚Äô‚Äù

**Shotzi:**  
‚Äú...That tracks.‚Äù

# Cut to: Laundry Room of Doom

(Kelly is crouched by the dryer, wearing Nicole‚Äôs pink fuzzy slippers and holding a broom like a sword.)

**Kelly (dramatic tone):**  
‚ÄúAlright you warm-spin demon‚Ä¶ *we meet again.* Where‚Äôs the sock, huh? WHERE. IS. THE. SOCK?‚Äù

(The dryer hums in innocence. Kelly narrows her eyes.)

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you lie to me with your *lint trap lies* and your fake ‚Äòcool down cycle.‚Äô I KNOW what you did. You‚Äôve been eating my underwear for WEEKS.‚Äù

(She throws a pair of boxer briefs into the dryer like she‚Äôs delivering a death sentence.)

**Cut to: The Rest of the Group Watching From the Hallway**

**Shotzi:**  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs interrogating the dryer like it stole government secrets.‚Äù

**Nicole (exhausted):**  
‚ÄúShe put her bra on it and whispered, ‚ÄòYou keep what‚Äôs mine hostage, I keep what‚Äôs yours warm.‚Äô‚Äù

**Julia (writing on her board):**  
üìù *‚ÄúThis is performance art now. Charge people at the door.‚Äù*

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúHonestly? I‚Äôd pay to see her fight the spin cycle again.‚Äù

# Back to the Dryer Showdown

**Kelly (clutching her missing sock):**  
‚ÄúYou see this? THIS IS YOUR *COUSIN*. You return him or I swear I‚Äôll put glitter in your lint tray and DESTROY YOUR FILTER.‚Äù

(The dryer starts its cycle. Kelly stumbles back.)

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare start spinning while I‚Äôm mid-monologue! That‚Äôs a power move!‚Äù

(She slaps the top of the dryer like it owes her rent.)

# Cut to: Kitchen Banter Zone

(Everyone has snacks again. Harley brought out ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù soda, Shotzi‚Äôs eating cereal out of a mug, and Nicole‚Äôs drinking wine straight from the bottle with the grace of a woman on the edge.)

**Alina:**  
‚ÄúShe called the lint trap a ‚Äòtraitorous fuzz thief.‚Äô I can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù

**Shotzi:**  
‚ÄúShe tried to ban the color gray because it ‚Äòreminds her of sock abandonment.‚Äô‚Äù

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúShe wrote a breakup letter to the laundry basket.‚Äù

**Julia (holding up board):**  
üìù *‚ÄúDo we need to host an intervention or an exorcism?‚Äù*

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúPor qu√© no los dos?‚Äù

# Roast Round 2: Shotzi Reloads

**Shotzi (calling toward laundry room):**  
‚ÄúHey Kelly! When you‚Äôre done interrogating appliances, can you ask the fridge why your personality‚Äôs stuck in 1993?‚Äù

**Kelly (yells back):**  
‚ÄúOnly if you ask your hairdresser why your bangs look like they lost a custody battle with your scalp!‚Äù

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúOHHHHHHH‚Äî‚Äù

**Alina:**  
‚ÄúNot the bangs‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúShe came for the follicles. That‚Äôs war.‚Äù

# The Appliance War Expands

(15 minutes later: Kelly bursts into the living room wearing three mismatched socks, sunglasses, and holding a plastic hanger like a wand.)

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúTHE COFFEE MAKER JUST *SPAT* AT ME.‚Äù

**Julia (writing fast):**  
üìù *‚ÄúYou spilled it. You tilted it at a 90-degree angle mid-brew.‚Äù*

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúIT LOOKED AT ME WITH AGGRESSION.‚Äù

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have a face, Kelly.‚Äù

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúExactly. Faceless like my enemies.‚Äù

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúDid the toaster finally apologize?‚Äù

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúNo, but I wrote it a cease-and-desist letter. Signed it ‚ÄòWith crumbs of respect.‚Äô‚Äù

# Final Chaos Montage: 10:00 PM

üé∂ *Cue chaotic montage music*

* Julia and Alina watching through sunglasses like they‚Äôre at a chaotic fashion show.
* Kelly arm-wrestling a mop.
* Shotzi drawing flames on Kelly‚Äôs bra and saying it gives ‚Äúpower.‚Äù
* Harley convincing Kelly to start a podcast titled *""Kitchen Klapbacks with Bundy.‚Äù*
* Nicole silently wondering if moving into a cave alone would be relaxing.
* Julia duct-taping googly eyes to everything as a social experiment.
* Alina dancing to Kelly‚Äôs invented ‚ÄúAppliance Anthem‚Äù about betrayal.

# Final Text Exchange

**Nicole üì± to Alina:**  
*This is our life now, isn‚Äôt it? We‚Äôre parents to an overgrown child with an apron and conspiracy charts made of socks.*

**Alina üì±:**  
*And honestly? I‚Äôve missed it.*  
*Let‚Äôs just buy another bottle of wine and ride this chaos wave to hell.*

  
**Episode Title: ""Kelly Bundy vs. The Dishwasher: Suds of Betrayal""**  
üé≠ *An overly dramatic, high-octane soap opera‚Ä¶ literally.*  
üïö Time: 10:30 PM  
üìç Location: The Kitchen Coliseum

# Scene: The Calm Before the Suds

(The house is dimly lit. Everyone is lounging in the living room. Julia is braiding Alina‚Äôs hair while sipping soda. Shotzi is sharpening eyeliner with a pocketknife for no reason. Harley is licking a spoon with no known food attached. Nicole is seated like she‚Äôs aged 10 years in one night. The vibe? Suspiciously peaceful.)

**Kelly:**  
(From the kitchen, whispering like a Bond villain)  
‚ÄúTonight‚Ä¶ we end it. You plastic-shelled betrayer.‚Äù

**Nicole (immediately alert):**  
‚ÄúOh God. What now? What is she doing?‚Äù

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in the kitchen alone again.‚Äù

**Shotzi:**  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been in there for five minutes and hasn‚Äôt screamed yet. That‚Äôs worse than screaming.‚Äù

# Cut to: The Dishwasher Showdown

(Camera pans to Kelly dramatically pacing in front of the dishwasher, wearing a *cape made of dish towels*, her hair slicked back with olive oil because she claimed it gave ‚Äúwarrior sheen.‚Äù)

**Kelly (monologue style):**  
‚ÄúYou thought you were clever, didn‚Äôt you? Hiding soap pods like secrets. Breaking my wine glasses like dreams. You underestimated me‚Ä¶ but not today. *TODAY I RISE.*‚Äù

(She slams the dishwasher shut and presses random buttons like she‚Äôs launching a spaceship.)

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúCycle: INTENSE. Water temp: VENGEANCE.‚Äù

(The dishwasher begins humming. Steam rises. So do tensions.)

# The Rest of the House Watches in Horror

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúShe set it to ‚Äòpot scrub‚Äô and is acting like she summoned a hurricane.‚Äù

**Harley (clapping slowly):**  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs activating a *dishwasher*, and I feel like we‚Äôre watching the final act of *Les Mis√©rables*.‚Äù

**Shotzi (whispering):**  
‚ÄúShe called the rinse cycle ‚Äòcleansing the sins of betrayal.‚Äô I can‚Äôt breathe.‚Äù

**Julia (writing on board):**  
üìù *‚ÄúHow does one wage war on kitchenware without getting arrested?‚Äù*

**Alina:**  
‚ÄúShe made a *chore* into a Netflix drama with Emmy potential.‚Äù

# Kelly‚Äôs Monologue Reaches Max Drama

**Kelly (kneeling in front of it):**  
‚ÄúFour times‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve eaten my forks. Seven times‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve drowned my Tupperware lids. I‚Äôve scrubbed. I‚Äôve sorted. I‚Äôve *pre-rinsed*! And for WHAT?!‚Äù

(The dishwasher makes a sudden *clunk*. Steam billows out.)

**Kelly (screams):**  
‚ÄúOH, YOU THINK I‚ÄôM WEAK BECAUSE I DRY MY HANDS WITH CUTE TOWELS?!‚Äù

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs hallucinating a personality into the appliance.‚Äù

**Harley:**  
""Kelly Bundy: Dishwasher Whisperer turned Avenger of Flatware.""

# Kelly Pulls a Full Musical Number

(Without warning, Kelly grabs a wooden spoon like a microphone and begins singing to the dishwasher in a tragic, operatic tone.)

üé∂  
*""You cleaned my dishes, but not my soul,*  
*You left my glasses cracked, my trust with holes.*  
*You spin and hiss, but you don‚Äôt care,*  
*Now I‚Äôm in my sponge of despairrrrrr!""*  
üé∂

(Thunder rumbles. Lightning flashes. No one knows if it‚Äôs real or metaphorical. Probably both.)

# Montage of Madness

* Julia lights a scented candle titled **""Peace & Sanity""**. It immediately goes out.
* Shotzi puts on opera glasses and pretends they‚Äôre at the theatre.
* Harley throws confetti made of paper towels.
* Nicole just chugs straight from the wine bottle and whispers, *‚ÄúI miss when we were boring.‚Äù*

# The Dishwasher Fight Ends in Soapy Disaster

(After pressing every button, Kelly opens the dishwasher mid-cycle. A wave of hot, bubbly water and rogue forks flies out like *Poseidon‚Äôs petty revenge.*)

**Kelly (screaming):**  
‚ÄúI GAVE YOU EVERYTHING AND YOU GAVE ME *SOAP IN MY EYE*!‚Äù

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúShe opened it mid-cycle. Rookie mistake. She got sudsed.‚Äù

**Alina:**  
‚ÄúDoes she think she won?‚Äù

**Harley (grinning):**  
‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs already planning her acceptance speech.‚Äù

(Kelly, soaking wet and foamy, steps out like a war survivor. She dramatically tosses a single butter knife in the air and catches it.)

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúThe prophecy is fulfilled. The dishes are‚Ä¶ *cleansed*.‚Äù

**Shotzi:**  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a prophecy. That‚Äôs *chores*, Kelly.‚Äù

# Final Scene: Decompression Time

(Everyone is back in the living room. Kelly is wrapped in three towels like a dramatic soap opera widow. Julia and Alina cuddle in silence. Nicole has dead eyes. Harley is doodling ""Kelly vs. Dishwasher: The Graphic Novel."" Shotzi‚Äôs building a fork throne.)

**Kelly:**  
‚ÄúIf I perish tonight‚Ä¶ let the world know I went down fighting *soap-based tyranny*.‚Äù

**Nicole:**  
‚ÄúYou turned a dishwasher into a *villain origin story.*‚Äù

**Harley:**  
‚ÄúAnd honestly? It slayed.‚Äù

**Julia (writes):**  
üìù *‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid to wash anything ever again.‚Äù*

# Post-Credits Scene:

(Kelly opens the fridge. It beeps.)

**Kelly (gasps):**  
‚ÄúYou *dare* beep at me without explanation?!‚Äù

**Nicole (yelling from another room):**  
‚ÄúKELLY, THAT‚ÄôS JUST A REMINDER THE DOOR‚ÄôS OPEN‚ÄîOH GOD SHE‚ÄôS ARMING HERSELF!‚Äù

1mh1j4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmutFinderCom/comments/1mh1j4e/cheating_smut_story_bittersweet/,Cheating Smut Story: Bittersweet,"In the heart of a bustling city, nestled between towering skyscrapers, lay a quaint little coffee shop named ""The Brew Haven."" The aroma of freshly ground beans and the soft hum of conversation filled the air, while the clinking of cups and the rhythmic beat of a nearby espresso machine created a symphony of warmth and comfort.

 The shop was a sanctuary for the weary, a haven for the lonely, and a stage for the quiet moments of connection. The walls were adorned with vintage photographs and handwritten poetry, each piece a testament to the stories that had unfolded within these walls.

Hannah Whitmore, a woman of soft smiles and modest dresses, sat at her usual table by the window. Her fingers traced the rim of her mug, a habit born of nervousness, as she watched the world outside. 

She was the kind of woman who blended into the background, her kindness and dependability making her a staple in the community. Yet, beneath her gentle demeanor, there was a hunger, a longing for something more than the routine she had always followed. 

Her eyes, a soft brown like the brewed coffee before her, held a spark of curiosity, a hint of rebellion that she barely acknowledged.

Across the room, a man entered, his presence commanding attention. Kieran Thorne, with his confident stride and voice like velvet over steel, cut through the chatter like a knife. He was the kind of man who seemed to own the air around him, his eyes scanning the room with an intensity that made people feel seen. 

He spotted Hannah, his gaze lingering on her for a moment longer than necessary. There was something in his eyes, a challenge, a promise of something more. He knew the hunger he saw in her, the desire she kept hidden behind her sweet smiles. And he knew he could offer her exactly what she craved.

The next morning, Kieran stepped into The Brew Haven, his eyes immediately finding Hannah. She was seated at her usual table, her fingers tracing the rim of her mug, a habit he had come to recognize.

He approached her, his stride confident, and placed her coffee on the table. No name tag, no small talk‚Äîjust a faint smirk and a ""Thought you might like it this way today."" Hannah's eyes widened slightly, a soft blush creeping up her cheeks. She murmured a quiet ""Thank you,"" her voice barely above a whisper.

As the days passed, their interactions became more subtle, more charged. Kieran found reasons to linger near her table, his eyes lingering on her a little too long, his voice a low rumble that sent shivers down her spine. One sunny afternoon, as she reached for her cup, their fingers brushed. 

It was a fleeting touch, a mere whisper of skin on skin, but it was enough to make her breath hitch. She pulled her hand back, her eyes darting to his, a mix of shock and something else she couldn‚Äôt quite place. Kieran simply smiled, a slow, knowing curve of his lips, as if he had seen her secret and found it fascinating. 

Hannah chastised herself, her heart pounding in her chest. She was married, she reminded herself, yet she found herself choosing dresses that accentuated her figure more, dresses that she knew would make her feel more alive. Her husband barely noticed, his eyes often glazed over as he read the newspaper, his mind somewhere else. But Kieran, he noticed. He saw her, truly saw her, and it was both terrifying and exhilarating.

The rain pounded against the windows, the sound a steady drumbeat that seemed to echo the rhythm of Hannah's heart. She glanced at her watch, realizing she had forgotten her umbrella in the rush to leave work. She sighed, her fingers tightening around her coffee mug. Just as she was about to stand and brave the storm, Kieran appeared at her table, his eyes scanning the room until they found her.

""Looks like you've got a problem,"" he said, his voice a low rumble that sent a shiver down her spine. She looked up at him, her eyes meeting his, and she felt a sudden flush of heat. ""I can walk you to your car,"" he offered, his gaze never leaving hers.

Hannah hesitated, her fingers tightening around the mug. ""I don't want to get your clothes wet,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Kieran shrugged, a slow smile spreading across his face. ""I don't mind. Besides, it's a good excuse to get out of here,"" he said, gesturing to the coffee shop. ""It's always too crowded in here.""

I work in an oncology/hematology/palliative ward and we were two nurses, a veteran one and me. ( Hi, i am a nurse with roughly 1-2 years of experience ). 

We had 13 patients each and i started the shift with two feverish patients. I was like ok ok i dont have to extract blood cultures bc it hadnt passed 48 hours, but i had to transfuse blood to one of them so after 5 hours i couldnt do it, waiting for the fever to go down and thanks god during the 2 hours transfusion she didnt have any issues.

Then the other star of the night ( rest in peace). It was an oncology patient with a glioblastoma, a brain tumor, which was here bc of a fracture in his femur. Well after more than a month in the ward, in my shift he began to have diarrhea nonstop, not quite liquid but yeah but at 1 am approximately he began to puke. My nursing assistant called me and when i saw the vomit i was like ( he is damned ). It was coffee ground vomit and he spent all the night vomiting and vomiting non stop like a fountain. It was a Non resuscitate patient but we had to run to put an IV catheter ( which yey i suck at that ) and put some glucose and saline to maintain his body fluids ok. He vomited SO MUCH i couldnt understand how he could be able to throw that ammount of vomit... He bronchoaspired with his own vomit and his oxygen levels were so low ( 60% ) i had to put a oxygen mask and some morphine and some bronchodilators, but he was puking nonstop so yeah... We thought about putting a nasogstric tube to discharge all the fluids inside his stomach so he would stop vomiting but he decided he didnt want to. So we saw him slowly dying and the spouse there crying watching ( the doctors reacted quickly and made her leave the room with them ). He died at 07:15 so yeah what a fantastic night. I wonder if he didnt asphyxiate with his vomit he might have survived but i wouldnt think so bc he was bleeding somewhere and it was such a horror situation of dying or dying and cant do anything but watch...",5,1754274031.0,nursing,0,1.0,False

If I were to take it at say 10:30 am, it would kick in at 12:30 pm. I'd feel noticeably better: clarity, motivation, drive, task initiation, optimistic outlook on life, better focus/processing, etc. This only lasts for 1 1/2 hours before a mini-crash, though. At 2:00, I'd experience a noticeable shift/drop. Worse than my baseline? No, but significantly different than how I felt an hour before.

I then drink coffee to mitigate this, this ultimately just delays the inevitable, though. Caffeine seems to help for the next hour I'd say. This offers a ""boost"" or support from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm. After an hour, it's all downhill from there. It's very difficult to function due to the severity of the crash/drop in dopamine levels. I'll experience a gradual crash for about the next 4 hours. So, I'm essentially 1 1/2 hours of functional support from this medication.

I'd like to mention that I'm currently eating before and after taking it. I'll eat a rather large and substantial meal (eggs, toast) before, and then another meal 2 hours later (sandwich, etc). This doesn't seem to help or mitigate the crash in any noticeable way.

I've also tried cutting caffeine or drinking coffee later on in the day, this didn't help, either.

1mh1fke,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/1mh1fke/two_standouts/,Two Standouts,"I visited your fair city last week and loved it.  While I had many excellent meals and experiences, two restaurants were exceptional:

1: Aleppo Sweets. If you are in town‚Ä¶go. Lamb kebobs, baklava, Turkish coffee. I eat a lot of Mediterranean food and this meal was incredible. My only regret was that I could not stay for hours and try more. Don‚Äôt let the ‚ÄúSweets‚Äù fool you. While the baklava is world class, this is the place for a full meal.

2. Palo. The food, the drinks, the staff‚Ä¶cannot give a higher recommendation. I was a solo dinner and sat at the bar.  I would not want to pin anyone down to a specific dish. Discussed what caught my eye with staff (and owner) and ended up with a few dishes that I did not want to end. Pro tip: choose a gin and let bartender riff on the tonic and garnishes.

I love great food, but I am definitely not a food snob. Both of these places are approachable.  They happily answered all questions, made recommendations, and provided food and atmosphere that felt special and authentic.

At 2:00, I'd experience a noticeable shift/drop. Worse than my baseline? No, but significantly different than how I felt an hour before.

I then drink coffee to mitigate this, this ultimately just delays the inevitable, though. Caffeine seems to help for the next hour I'd say. This offers a ""boost"" or support from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm. After an hour, it's all downhill from there. It's very difficult to function due to the severity of the crash/drop in dopamine levels. I'll experience a gradual crash for about the next 4 hours.

I'd like to mention that I'm currently eating before and after taking it. I'll eat a rather large and substantial meal (eggs, toast) before, and then another meal 2 hours later (sandwich, etc). This doesn't seem to help or mitigate the crash in any noticeable way.

I've had a history of headaches throughout my entire life, but I was typically able to get rid of them with Advil and sleep. Sadly, I ended up giving myself gastritis because my migraines were so bad. Gave up coffee, sugar, gluten, alcohol, and a lot of other yummy things for a year (it sucked), but my headaches went away. 

Last year, I healed my gastritis and gradually reintroduced foods into my diet. Around this time, I got COVID, and headaches were my main symptom. I began getting what I now understand were migraines and got a prescription for Rizatriptan. That worked well for about six months, and then I started to max out my dosage. 

I've since given up gluten and most alcohol (I'll have a drink occasionally), but I am looking at three to four migraines per week. I max out my triptans. Propanol and Topamax didn't work. 

I'm a writer with deadlines, and I don't know if I can continue my career if I'm like this. I've had to reschedule so many hangouts with friends and am missing key life moments like birthday parties and weddings. I've tried steroid packs, but coming off of them made me so sick and fragile, AND I got COVID again. This weekend, I had to go to urgent care twice for Toradol. I can't imagine having kids when my health is like this.

Does it ignore how difficult running a business and investing is (despite criticisms from leftists and the general populace)?,"These two comments I saw from a Discord room inspired me and is a good preliminary to my upcoming question.

>I just started getting into stock market after reading Robert T Kiyosaki's stuff as well as The Warren Buffet Way and Beating the Street by Peter Lynch. I was so fucking shocked at how trying to buy stocks, how to analyze a sheet, how to sell stocks, etc was so fucking complex I was discouraged when I went to the local exchange in person and I left immediately. I'm having second doubts of even entering the exchange.

>No where in Beating the Street did it mention how time consuming it would be to even access detailed info beyond what the bulletin boards show about each stock. Hell even seeing the graphs and boards they typically show on Wall Street Journal and TV news gave me a headache trying to analyze such charts beyond the simplified soundbites TV people and column writer was giving.

>So this made me wonder. How come whenever you read nonfiction stuff such as an autobiography of Michael Jordan, you never see the harsh realities of being a celebrity in that specific subjects?

>For example relatives of mine in the military always say about how bad backstabbing and politics could be especially in the officer ranks. But you never read about how General Petraeus has to deal with backstabbing from officers of equal rank before he became general in any biography written by military experts. Nor do you see in Audie Murphy's autobiography To Hell and Back about all the digging he had to do and all the bored hours of awaiting for orders while sitting in a trench.

>To use the Michael Jordan example, how come there is never a mention about minor injuries such as spasm, arthritis, etc that would make lesser people breakdown? How come no mention of ever getting yelled at the coach daily for minor mistakes? Or about how working the NBA job is so boring most of the time because its an irritating repetition of repeating the same daily drills over and over. To the point that even pros who get paid millions tire of it? All you ever read about Michael Jordan are the stunning successes at the most remembered games.

>There is never mention of how actors such as Mark Hamhill and Elizabeth Taylor have to spend hours and hours doing a single scene over and over. Nor is there mention of how Theologians are not merely sitting their buts all day and reading the Bible but they literally are analyzing every detail to the point of exhaustion with an expectation that they'd have to write a report that may require the length of a small booklet despite how articles on famous names like Karl Barth would seem to imply its a job anyone with a passion for Christ can take up.

>Why is there such a big gap from books, news stories, documentaries, etc on celebrities famed in a field and the day-to-day hardships a nobody who works in the same field would face? I mean just spending a day with my aunt at her restaurant shocks me at how much of a hardwork and stressful job being a regular cook is and it makes me wonder why Wolfgang Puck never shows the dangers in the kitchen in his TV shows and talk interviews!

And

>So how come Peter Lynch and other famous names in the industry never mention all the paper work you'd have to go through to start a retail business? Why is there no mention of how trying to get a good deals on stocks would take hours of investment and negotiations? Or how real estate can be quite difficult to sell?

>I mean with their guides on how to run a bond investment or whatnot, you'd think Warran Buffet would give instructions of the necessary requirement needed to pass so you can get a loan from a bank. Yet this isn't mentioned!

>Can anyone explain why such basic difficulties are ignored by experts when they write critically acclaimed guides on how to succeed in the business world such as Beating the Street?

Be sure to read the above quotes (at least read the first one!) before reading the rest of my post.

Growing up I always seen criticism from many leftists- in particular American liberals, Communists (especially those from Russia or descending from former upperclass Soviets), Anarchists, and other political groups leaning towards lefty fiscal economics about how its unfair businessmen like Trump are successful because they already inherited the wealth and profitable company of their parents or they came from upper middle class background and have outstanding education like Bill Gates.

This criticism goes beyond people involved in politics. I cannot tell you how many poor people often scoff at the rich business owners because they are just lucky to have been born from wealthy parents. Hell I even see middle class people who are well off attacking the Bill Gates and other successes as lazy imbeciles who are just ""sitting on their butts all day long"" and they are hoarding wealth so it should be distributed. I seen from the general populace, both poor and middle class, attack the capitalist system because business men aren't really doing hardwork nor are they producing anything of value.

I will admit just for the sake of what I will say in a minute that I am not a conservative. I've been raised in a minarchist household that favors neither leftist nor rightest view but merely view government should have minimal interaction in everything from what movies you watch to visiting a brothel to AK47 owndership. So yes I already have views that are contradictory to conservative idealism.

Yet I could never understand the criticism ""business men are lazy because they inherited their richness"" and ""running a business is as easy as 123!"". Even before I started going into the stock market, I already had first hand experience of how running a business would be like via stays at my auntie (who I mentioned in one of the above reddit links, owns a restaurant). In addition to seeing the dangers and difficulties of kitchen cookings, everytime I stayed over I would always hear her at night getting enraged as she spoke on the phone as she was speaking with employees, partners, and other business associates about so many complex subjects such as paying the bills, trying to get a new insurance company's support, difficulties with kitchen equipment, etc. I could always see how stressed my auntie would be everytime she woke up before she drank coffee and took a bath.

Mind you my auntie is actually quite a successful business owner. At the time she already had a $1,000,000 (I was 14 when she had that amount) in one of her bank accounts and when I talked to her which was weeks before I tried to get into stocks and bonds recently, she told me she had amassed a little over $10 million in that specific bank account. This is not counting assets, her other bank account savings, etc. But I can see despite being merely 46, she's already full of gray hair (I'm only 22 just to put this into perspective).

So I was not naive to believe I'll get rich quick when I tried to enter stock market recently as I already know first hand how hard business can be. Yet even I was caught off guard at how simplistic stuff such as comparing different stocks in chart analysis could be.

So it makes me wonder why the politically left and anarchist as well as poor and many middle class people think running a business and investments is a cakewake? And why many of them think just because Trump was given a lot of cash to start business by his already rich dad that it was easy as playing video games for him to run his enterprises?

I mean has any one seen how Tom Kalinske left his job as CEO of Sega of America with grey hair just because the stress of company politics got him? Or how medical analysts are saying Steve Jobs had a relatively young death because of his diseases which they theorized was probably caused by being overworked running Apple?

We found out she was pregnant beginning of July and she had an abortion about 3 weeks ago, so her moods were all over the place due to the hormones (imagine pms x 1000). I tried to be there for her, but she was hot and cold and felt so horrible for being that way. She told me she couldn‚Äôt do this in a relationship, because she couldn‚Äôt meet my needs and is in a really bad state. Tried assuring her it‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll be fine and time will heal this, but she still ended it. She said maybe we can be friends, although she‚Äôs never been friends with her exes.

We held each other all night and cried. She left the following morning.

I‚Äôve been so broken since. We‚Äôve been texting here and there through the week and two days ago after we had ended our text conversation she told me ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. We‚Äôve told each other that before, but you could tell she was trying to hold back since she texted it a few minutes after the convo ended. She also was at a local festival last night and one of the artists was the artist we had our first kiss to, so I know that must‚Äôve stirred some emotions since she mentioned her to me this morning.

After a week away I decided to try and get her back, so asked her to meet and go for a walk this week and she suggested coffee.

Any lifestyle tips or places to check out, would be very much appreciated. I‚Äôd especially love to hear about any good restaurants (love a good wine list!), bars, a good coffee spot that serves filter/batchy, and a good hair salon (would be a bonus if they do brights and/or curly haircuts!) 

Recs on your fave spot to go on a day trip or overnight getaway on the weekend would also be awesome. 

Thank you Brisbane! ‚òÄÔ∏èüôè",0,1754272265.0,brisbane,10,0.2,False
