The 5 minutes is for Strike to return to the office with mashed peas. He listens to the phone message and it's Lawrence, MI5 who wants to meet Strike about an assignment. They agree to meet the following day.
Robin goes to the Ritz and before Murphy can speak she tells him Iverson has blabbed and she knows about the engagement proposal. She tells him she is angry, frustrated and confused, that she is seeing a therapist on Monday and Murphy should keep away until she has a clear head. 
Strike meets Lawrence on Saturday and is told there is a top secret investigation needed at the army in Portsmouth. It will need undercover work with no one; family and colleagues to know. He will have to sign the Official Secret Act. Strike agrees and says he will travel to Portsmouth on Sunday.
Robin plans to confront Strike on Monday but on Sunday receives an e mail from Strike that he is going away, that Robin is in sole charge of the agency. Robin goes to the office but it is locked, she calls Strike but his phone is ringing in his desk drawer. On Monday Robin goes to the office and Pat has received a note from Strike telling her that Robin is in charge and to give her full support. Pat notices no ring on Robin's finger and tells her that she over heard them on Friday evening. Robin tells her everything and that she is seeing a therapist that afternoon.
After some sessions with the no nonsense, straight talking, sweary therapist Robin feels much better and decides to take a break in York. Robin calls her mum and they meet at Betty's, order coffee, Yorkshire Fat Rascals and Robin tells her mum about the UHC; the box, near drowning and the dying boy. She tells her about the gorilla, mask, dagger and attempted abduction and that she has seen a therapist and feels much better. Robin then tells her mum that she has been love with Strike for a long time but as she thought him not wanting a stable relationship she turned to Murphy. But it has not worked out with Murphy and Strike told her he loved her and wanting to marry but she pushed him away and now he has left the Agency. Linda offered her full support. Before leaving Betty's Robin bought the tea that she had forgotten to buy in Harrogate.
Strike is nearing the end of his assignment but needs help from 2 of the Agency staff, Lawrence agrees and Strike calls the Agency. Pat tells him that Robin is resting in York, that she has seen a therapist and she is not engaged. Strike gives Pat the hotel details in Portsmouth and asks her to send Barclay and Wardle. Pat calls Robin tells her what Strike is doing and his request. Robin tells Pat not to take action, travels back to Denmark Street, picks up Wardle and they drive to Portsmouth. In the hotel Robin and Strike have a heart to heart talk, affirm that they love each other and kiss!
Well, I am sure JKR will come up with a different and more convoluted story but I feel better for writing it and as Robin might say it was therapeutic ",1,1760861261.0,cormoran_strike,0,1.0,False

INTRODUCTION

“INNOCENCE” is psychological thriller mainly set in 1999’s

this is page 1 the beginning of the story, where the whole story setup

more pages will shared soon…….

INNOCENCE — Page 1

The flight board at JFK flickered like a dying heartbeat.

Flight 237 | Destination: New York City | Date: March 15, 1989.

The letters buzzed, threatened to disappear, then held steady, barely.

He stood at Gate 42, watching the line of passengers shuffle forward.

His ticket was damp in his palm, the ink starting to blur.

Around him, the gate area hummed with the usual chaos:

a child screaming about a forgotten toy, businessmen barking into brick-sized cell phones, an elderly woman struggling with a suitcase that had seen better decades.

“Finally going home,” someone murmured behind him.

The voice carried that particular exhaustion of the long-distance traveler, hope mixed with bone-deep fatigue.

His chest tightened……….

The boarding door gaped open like a mouth.

Beyond it, the jet bridge stretched into artificial light and recycled air.

He could smell it from here, that familiar airplane scent of coffee, cleaning solution, and something else.

Something metallic.

Or maybe that was just his imagination.

His hand trembled. The ticket fluttered.

Something’s wrong……

He couldn’t name it. Couldn’t point to a single concrete reason.

But his body & mind knew.

Every cell in his body screamed at him to turn around, to walk away, to go anywhere but through that door.

“Sir?” The flight attendant’s smile was professional, automatic.

“We’re boarding now. May I see your ticket?”

He opened his mouth. Nothing came out.

Inside the cabin, the world divided itself into two distinct realities.

In business class, leather seats exhaled softly as passengers settled into them.

Crystal champagne flutes caught the overhead lights, sending little rainbows dancing across expensive suits.

A man in his fifties with a gold watch and silk tie swirled his drink and gazed back toward the economy curtain with something that might have been amusement.

“Look at them,” he murmured to his seatmate, a woman draped in pearls.

“Scrambling over each other like ants.”

The woman’s lips curved.

“We paid for peace. They paid for chaos.”

She took a delicate sip.

“That’s just economics.”

Neither bothered to lower their voices.

Beyond the curtain, economy class was a study in controlled desperation.

Passengers wedged carry-ons into overhead bins that were never quite large enough.

A suitcase fell with a thunderous crash. Nobody apologized.

A baby’s wail cut through the cabin, sharp and relentless.

An elderly man fumbled with his seatbelt, fingers shaking, while a teenager behind him sighed dramatically and looked away.

The flight attendants moved through it all with fixed smiles, directing traffic, soothing anxieties, pretending not to notice the champagne glasses glinting in the cabin ahead.

“Overhead bins secured.”

“Seatbelts fastened.”

“Prepare for departure.”

The words were a ritual.

A prayer that everything would be fine.

The man stood frozen at the gate.

“Sir, we need to close the door.”

The flight attendant’s smile had tightened.

Passengers behind him shifted and muttered.

Someone cleared their throat pointedly.

His feet moved backward. One step. Another.

“I can’t,” his voice cracked. “I can’t get on.”

The attendant’s expression shifted from confusion to concern.

“Sir, if you’re experiencing anxiety, we have personnel who can—”

“No.”

He was already backing away, his luggage abandoned, his ticket crushed in his fist.

“No, I just... I need to go.”

The whispers followed him. Coward. Crazy. What’s wrong with him?

He didn’t care.

He stumbled away from the gate, his heart hammering, sweat soaking through his shirt, and he didn’t look back as the door sealed shut behind the last passenger.

Flight 237 taxied down the runway at 6:47 PM.

Inside, passengers settled into that strange pre-flight silence.

In business class, the champagne drinkers closed their eyes, already half asleep.

In economy, a mother gripped her daughter’s hand.

The girl pressed her face against the window, watching the ground begin to move.

The engines roared.

The plane accelerated.

Faster. Faster.

And then, lift.

For the first couple of minutes, everything was normal.

Then the first explosion tore through the left engine.

The cabin lights flickered.

Oxygen masks dropped like puppet strings cut loose.

The plane rolled violently to the side, and suddenly everyone was screaming, business class and economy alike, their voices finally equal in terror.

Metal shrieked.

The plane shuddered, trying to correct itself, failing.

Through the windows, passengers saw fire trailing from the wing, bright orange against the darkening sky.

Someone prayed in Spanish.

Someone else vomited.

A flight attendant grabbed the intercom, but her voice was drowned out by the second explosion.

The plane was falling now.

Not diving yet, but sinking, the nose tilting down, gravity remembering its claim.

In seat 14C, a businessman still clutched his champagne glass. It shattered in his hand.

In seat 32B, the mother pulled her daughter close and whispered,

“Close your eyes, baby. Close your eyes.”

The third explosion was the loudest. And then there was only fire everywhere

By 9:00 PM, the news had spread across every channel.

Channel 9 News showed the same footage on loop: wreckage scattered across a field, emergency lights painting the darkness red and blue, body bags being loaded into ambulances with terrible efficiency.

The anchor’s voice was grave and practiced.

“Tragedy struck Flight 237 tonight, just minutes after takeoff from JFK Airport. All 217 passengers and crew are confirmed dead. Early reports suggest this was not a mechanical failure. Investigators are calling it deliberate. Authorities have assigned FBI Detective Carl Branson to lead the investigation.”

“No survivors. No witnesses. Just questions.”

The anchor’s face was somber.

“Families gathered at JFK Airport, desperate for answers that may never come.”

END OF PAGE 1

Author’s Note:

Thank you for reading INNOCENCE (Page 1).

This is just the beginning of a larger psychological thriller that explores truth, guilt, and human fragility.

Music pulsed from the speakers, laughter bubbled from nearby tables, and the low hum of conversation filled the air like static. I hadn’t even planned on going out, but my best friend insisted I needed “a change of scenery.”

That’s how I ended up there — sitting at the bar, half-distracted by the swirl of people around me, sipping a cranberry cocktail that matched the soft pink of my dress.

https://preview.redd.it/2n5jevkx87vf1.jpg?width=2832&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78a2c4af978837782fda8465896d65989d3b68cc

That’s when I saw him.

He was sitting two stools over, dressed casually in a dark shirt, his attention fixed on the TV above the bar. I caught him glancing my way once, then again, and when our eyes met the second time, he smiled — not the overconfident kind, but something a little shy, a little curious.

“Hey,” he said after a moment, leaning slightly closer. “Do you mind if I ask what you’re drinking? It looks better than whatever this is.” He lifted his glass with a grin.

I laughed. “It’s just cranberry and lime. But it does photograph better.”

“That’s a solid reason to order it,” he said. “I’m Mark, by the way.”

“Frankie,” I said, shaking his hand, surprised at how easy it felt.

We talked for a while — about nothing at first. Music, movies, travel dreams neither of us could afford yet. He told me he’d recently moved to the city for work, still figuring out which coffee shop made the best espresso. I told him I’d lived here my whole life but still managed to get lost downtown at least once a week.

There was something genuine about him — calm, steady, and a little funny without trying too hard. I’d had enough conversations that went nowhere to recognize when one actually meant something.

When the bartender came around again, he glanced at me. “Can I get you another?”

I shook my head. “I should probably call it a night. Early morning tomorrow.”

He nodded, a little hesitant. “I get that. Still… I’ve really enjoyed talking to you.”

“Me too,” I admitted.

He paused, then said, “How about lunch tomorrow? There’s this café near the park. Quiet place. They make great sandwiches and terrible coffee — kind of their charm.”

I couldn’t help but smile. “That’s your sales pitch?”

“It’s honest,” he said with a grin. “And I make better coffee, so maybe it evens out.”

I laughed and, after a moment, said, “Alright. Lunch it is.”

We exchanged numbers, and when I walked out into the cool night air, I realized I was smiling — that kind of unplanned, involuntary smile that only happens when something feels right.

As I hailed a cab, my phone buzzed. A message.

*Looking forward to tomorrow — I’ll try not to ruin the bad coffee’s reputation too much.*

I laughed quietly to myself, typing back: *No promises needed. Just bring the charm.*

And for the first time in a while, I felt genuinely excited about what tomorrow might bring.",1,1760861028.0,PrettyChaos,0,1.0,False

“That’s just economics.”

Neither bothered to lower their voices.

Beyond the curtain, economy class was a study in controlled desperation.

Passengers wedged carry-ons into overhead bins that were never quite large enough.

A suitcase fell with a thunderous crash. Nobody apologized.

A baby’s wail cut through the cabin, sharp and relentless.

An elderly man fumbled with his seatbelt, fingers shaking, while a teenager behind him sighed dramatically and looked away.

The flight attendants moved through it all with fixed smiles, directing traffic, soothing anxieties, pretending not to notice the champagne glasses glinting in the cabin ahead.

“Overhead bins secured.”

“Seatbelts fastened.”

“Prepare for departure.”

The words were a ritual.

A prayer that everything would be fine.

The man stood frozen at the gate.

“Sir, we need to close the door.”

The flight attendant’s smile had tightened.

Passengers behind him shifted and muttered.

Someone cleared their throat pointedly.

His feet moved backward. One step. Another.

“I can’t,” his voice cracked. “I can’t get on.”

The attendant’s expression shifted from confusion to concern.

“Sir, if you’re experiencing anxiety, we have personnel who can—”

“No.”

He was already backing away, his luggage abandoned, his ticket crushed in his fist.

“No, I just... I need to go.”

The whispers followed him. Coward. Crazy. What’s wrong with him?

He didn’t care.

He stumbled away from the gate, his heart hammering, sweat soaking through his shirt, and he didn’t look back as the door sealed shut behind the last passenger.

Flight 237 taxied down the runway at 6:47 PM.

Inside, passengers settled into that strange pre-flight silence.

In business class, the champagne drinkers closed their eyes, already half asleep.

In economy, a mother gripped her daughter’s hand.

The girl pressed her face against the window, watching the ground begin to move.

The engines roared.

The plane accelerated.

Faster. Faster.

And then, lift.

For the first couple of minutes, everything was normal.

Then the first explosion tore through the left engine.

The cabin lights flickered.

Oxygen masks dropped like puppet strings cut loose.

The plane rolled violently to the side, and suddenly everyone was screaming, business class and economy alike, their voices finally equal in terror.

Metal shrieked.

The plane shuddered, trying to correct itself, failing.

Through the windows, passengers saw fire trailing from the wing, bright orange against the darkening sky.

Someone prayed in Spanish.

Someone else vomited.

A flight attendant grabbed the intercom, but her voice was drowned out by the second explosion.

The plane was falling now.

Not diving yet, but sinking, the nose tilting down, gravity remembering its claim.

In seat 14C, a businessman still clutched his champagne glass. It shattered in his hand.

In seat 32B, the mother pulled her daughter close and whispered,

“Close your eyes, baby. Close your eyes.”

The third explosion was the loudest. And then there was only fire everywhere

By 9:00 PM, the news had spread across every channel.

Channel 9 News showed the same footage on loop: wreckage scattered across a field, emergency lights painting the darkness red and blue, body bags being loaded into ambulances with terrible efficiency.

The anchor’s voice was grave and practiced.

“Tragedy struck Flight 237 tonight, just minutes after takeoff from JFK Airport. All 217 passengers and crew are confirmed dead. Early reports suggest this was not a mechanical failure. Investigators are calling it deliberate. Authorities have assigned FBI Detective Carl Branson to lead the investigation.”

“No survivors. No witnesses. Just questions.”

The anchor’s face was somber.

“Families gathered at JFK Airport, desperate for answers that may never come.”

It had been six years, but she was still there — somewhere between the edge of my dreams and the quiet hours of morning when the world hadn’t woken up yet. I used to lie on my back staring at the ceiling, wondering if she ever thought about me too. I’d tell myself I was over it, that people move on, but then a song would come on, or the rain would start, and it’d all come rushing back like it never left.
It wasn’t just missing her — it was missing us, the version of me that existed when she was around. Back then, life had a softness to it. I used to laugh easier, sleep better. Now, even in silence, it felt like the air was heavier.
I’d dream about her often. Sometimes we were back in school, standing under that same evergreen tree, rain dripping through the branches while the world blurred around us. Other times she was just out of reach — walking away down some long street I couldn’t follow. I’d wake up with my heart racing, my chest tight, half expecting to see her standing there like she used to. But it was always just me, in a quiet room, the hum of the fridge in the background, the night stretching on too long.
I tried everything to forget — the Air Force, the bars, the smoke, the long drives down roads that led nowhere. I thought maybe if I filled my life with enough noise, I could drown out the ache. But no matter where I went, she followed. Not in body, but in memory — the sound of her laugh, the way she’d tilt her head when she smiled. It wasn’t even that I thought we’d end up together again. It was that the part of me that had felt alive with her hadn’t found anywhere else to go.
Sometimes I wondered if I loved her because she was the only person who ever made me feel seen — not like a mistake, not like a burden, just me. The world had always been rough with me. I learned early that love came with strings or conditions, and I didn’t know what to do when it didn’t. With her, it was simple. For a little while, I got to feel what it was like to belong.
People told me I should move on. “It’s been years,” they’d say, like there was an expiration date for heartbreak. But grief doesn’t follow a calendar. It just lingers — quiet, patient. It waits for the right silence to creep back in.
There were nights when the quiet got too loud. I’d sit in the dark with nothing but my thoughts, the memories looping like old film reels. Her voice, her eyes, the rain — everything clearer than it had any right to be after all that time. I’d ask myself if maybe I was just holding onto a ghost, but then again, sometimes ghosts are all you have left.
Still, I kept going. Every morning I woke up felt like a small kind of victory. The coffee didn’t taste like much, the days all blurred together, but I was still here. Still breathing. That counted for something.
It’s strange — the world feels smaller now. When I was young, it always seemed too big to hold onto. Too fast, too loud, too unforgiving. Now, it’s the quiet that gets me. The spaces between things. The empty seat across the table. The echo of laughter that isn’t there anymore.
I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. Maybe that’s for the best. I wouldn’t even know what to say if I did. But sometimes, when the sky turns that deep blue right before night fully falls, I catch myself thinking about her. Wondering where she is, if she’s happy, if she ever remembers that boy who kissed her in the rain.
And even if she doesn’t — even if I’m just another face from her past — part of me still hopes that somewhere, in some quiet moment, she feels the same pull. Because the truth is, I’ve loved her longer than I’ve known how to stop.",1,1760860601.0,u_Acrobatic-Service586,0,1.0,False

“INNOCENCE” is psychological thriller mainly set in 1999’s

this is page 1 the beginning of the story, where the whole story setup

more pages will shared soon…….

INNOCENCE — Page 1

The flight board at JFK flickered like a dying heartbeat.

Flight 237 | Destination: New York City | Date: March 15, 1989.

The letters buzzed, threatened to disappear, then held steady, barely.

He stood at Gate 42, watching the line of passengers shuffle forward.

His ticket was damp in his palm, the ink starting to blur.

Around him, the gate area hummed with the usual chaos:

a child screaming about a forgotten toy, businessmen barking into brick-sized cell phones, an elderly woman struggling with a suitcase that had seen better decades.

“Finally going home,” someone murmured behind him.

The voice carried that particular exhaustion of the long-distance traveler, hope mixed with bone-deep fatigue.

His chest tightened……….

The boarding door gaped open like a mouth.

Beyond it, the jet bridge stretched into artificial light and recycled air.

He could smell it from here, that familiar airplane scent of coffee, cleaning solution, and something else.

Something metallic.

Or maybe that was just his imagination.

His hand trembled. The ticket fluttered.

Something’s wrong……

He couldn’t name it. Couldn’t point to a single concrete reason.

But his body & mind knew.

Every cell in his body screamed at him to turn around, to walk away, to go anywhere but through that door.

“Sir?” The flight attendant’s smile was professional, automatic.

“We’re boarding now. May I see your ticket?”

He opened his mouth. Nothing came out.

Inside the cabin, the world divided itself into two distinct realities.

In business class, leather seats exhaled softly as passengers settled into them.

Crystal champagne flutes caught the overhead lights, sending little rainbows dancing across expensive suits.

A man in his fifties with a gold watch and silk tie swirled his drink and gazed back toward the economy curtain with something that might have been amusement.

“Look at them,” he murmured to his seatmate, a woman draped in pearls.

“Scrambling over each other like ants.”

The woman’s lips curved.

“We paid for peace. They paid for chaos.”

She took a delicate sip.

“That’s just economics.”

Neither bothered to lower their voices.

Beyond the curtain, economy class was a study in controlled desperation.

Passengers wedged carry-ons into overhead bins that were never quite large enough.

A suitcase fell with a thunderous crash. Nobody apologized.

A baby’s wail cut through the cabin, sharp and relentless.

An elderly man fumbled with his seatbelt, fingers shaking, while a teenager behind him sighed dramatically and looked away.

The flight attendants moved through it all with fixed smiles, directing traffic, soothing anxieties, pretending not to notice the champagne glasses glinting in the cabin ahead.

“Overhead bins secured.”

“Seatbelts fastened.”

“Prepare for departure.”

The words were a ritual.

A prayer that everything would be fine.

The man stood frozen at the gate.

“Sir, we need to close the door.”

The flight attendant’s smile had tightened.

Passengers behind him shifted and muttered.

Someone cleared their throat pointedly.

His feet moved backward. One step. Another.

“I can’t,” his voice cracked. “I can’t get on.”

The attendant’s expression shifted from confusion to concern.

“Sir, if you’re experiencing anxiety, we have personnel who can—”

“No.”

He was already backing away, his luggage abandoned, his ticket crushed in his fist.

“No, I just... I need to go.”

I've worked in a lot of tough workplace cultures. This was just kinda silly. Last straw was getting a mid probation review report that was full of bullshit. I've already organised to work somewhere else the day after my last day and I'll be getting paid casual rates so happy days.

I don't think I've worked in a nursing job before where my scope of practice wasn't understood by my manager and where I've had such persistent, petty, unsupportive and just strange emails. She was actually nice and generally constructive in person. She has a ""social sciences"" degree and I don't think she's worked with many clinicians before. I don't mind when my colleagues are often moody since we are all human. But dishonest in writing to the point where obviously unsupportive and petty according to the paper trail is confusing to me. Just a full on keyboard warrior in writing and it seemed pretty clear she didn't want me to feel supported and probably wanted me to leave for some reason. I have been asking myself what I did wrong or is it just that she was expecting me to agree with her weird accusations.

went to use the public toilet a few mins walk from the tiny office. Got an email saying she had ""noticed"" I took 2 x 30 lunch breaks

emailed me saying that she and other staff had noticed I slammed the door.. I didn't and I doubt anyone else had spoken with her about a door slamming

just constant stuff like this, almost every day. I've had to ask her to stop so I can focus on my work.

once a client was in a crisis and called the office a few times. this was framed as me having a lack of boundaries because I hadn't prevented the client from contacting the service according to their expectations

  
I was told it was chill to get there a bit late as long as the work is done well. I had said how beneficial this arrangement is to my productivity and stress levels. I should have just ignored this and got there 10 mins early 

most other people would just rock up and then go get coffee. I don't really care what other people do but yeah.. was just a double standard.

supervision records were totally different from the actual conversation and were just an exercise in hostile line management, not at all like clinical supervision like im used to

I think it went sour when I had taken longer to get back from dropping off a client to another service. we had spoken about me getting back after 5 (there is often an expectation to drive clients out of business hours) she had CC'd her boss saying she hadn't approved of this, I reminded her there was another person there when we discussed the plan. then she recalled the conversation and tried to say she remembered the details and I had not followed those. 

one other time I had texted asking if I could bring the work car back the next day since I was so tired after a massive day of driving. was told to bring it back on the day next time unless I have prior approval. so I brought it back after I had had a rest.. this was after a full 8 hours too. she hasn't let this go even though I had asked her and did what she said

anyway.. just thought id share. if anyone has any advice on what I could have done differently or any tips for getting along in situations like this feel free.

I did attempt to get along and I could have gone through the standard process for getting support to get along. but I didn't think they would be trustworthy no matter what kind of support from the org happened. not worth working with a hostile boss",2,1760860420.0,NursingAU,1,1.0,False

Plus of debit card: the spent money is taken from my bank in real time, so my balance is always accurate. 

After being in Japan for 3,5 years I managed to get a credit card (debit was rejected), so I wonder how to smartly track expenses. 

I guess I am not used to it, but the fact that everything I spent will only be taken from my bank end of next month is kind of anxiety inducing for me. For online purchases here and there, sure, but all of it? 
There also seems no option to pay earlier haha I wish I could just pay off weekly. 

For you without the debit card, do you use PayPay for smaller stuff? Or do most people just not care about the looming payment and use credit card for everything from famima coffee to grocery shopping. 

I don’t have too many savings, and I am definitely not spending more than I could pay, just the fact that they already purchased stuff is paid so much later is kind of new to me and wonder how to manage that best.

\[voice-over\]

You've known me all your life. My work is alive 24/7. I have to be versatile, adaptable, and ready for any role you throw at me.

I manipulate history until it breathes, walk fictional gods into your living room, and drag buried secrets out from myth. I make heroes or villains. I make God lie.

I am a screenwriter. There is no other job like it.

When you sit down to watch TV, you've come to my door and knocked. I make you laugh. I make you cry. I scare you sideways. I thrill you with endless action, car chases, explosions, and war. I create the darkest places in your mind. I give you every reason to leave me—then I end with a cliffhanger. I can be *Sex in the City*, *Game of Thrones*, or I can be *Monty Python*.

I develop worlds in your imagination. I leave you with lasting quotes. *I see dead people.* *You talkin’ to me?* *Play it again, Sam.* *I am your father, Luke.* *You complete me.*

>

Somewhere between the original idea and the director is me, enunciating, memorizing, and weighing each word. You are a victim of my life's work. I pace myself. I speak slower. I repeat myself. I go silent. I gasp. I weep. I exact revenge. Oftentimes this is me alone at 3am reading the parts of five people to my captive furniture.

If I don't write enough, you get another commercial popped in. If I write too much, it gets chopped in post—and the DVD gets ""deleted scenes."" All me.

I invent names and people and identities. I create cultures, worlds, and universes. There is no job on Earth like it.

I give the future a voice. I rewrite the past. It doesn't matter if I'm wrong—as long as you’re entertained.

>

If you met me, you'd never know I had a thousand people talking in my head. You might think so-and-so is brilliant, but they're just actors reading my lines. You think you share souls with a character? That’s me again. You masturbated to someone I invented at 2am and gave an Australian accent to.

Without me, the show is over before it starts. A movie takes 90 minutes of my words and calls it a film. When I’ve said all that needs to be said—the credits can roll.

I can make anyone play piano. I just write it in. If the actor can’t read music, the director will need camera angles and CGI. That’s not my job. I just put the song into their mouth. That’s movie magic.

>

I am a screenwriter. I always get the last word. I can send you to sleep happy or sad. I give you people to root for and villains to hate. I nurse you along with dialogue. I motivate you. I deflate you. I make you nostalgic. I make you paranoid. I fill your head with voices I've given to people who don't exist.

My characters may be cited in court. *""Your honor, did you ever see that episode of Twin Peaks where...?""*

Such are the lives I write. So real, you prefer them to your own. I create sculpted illusions you trust more than your friends. I give you cozy comfort. I give you chaos. My work becomes the model for others. Others imitate me. I imitate art. I imitate science. I inform you, educate you, instruct you—all without you knowing.

I can deliver you a business meeting in Silicon Valley, a tour around a superconductor, or a bullet-ridden autopsy. I can change genders, races, geographies, or entire realities.

I can make you believe Ukraine invaded Russia. That North Korea is bluffing. That big is beautiful. I can situate the action anywhere in the multiverse, yet the camera never leaves a Hollywood soundstage.

My workshop is light-years wide—and can be boxed into a truck.

>

I give you quotes to mutter around the coffee cooler. I leave impressions decades deep. I am Indiana Jones. I am Bridget Jones. I am Homer Simpson. I am Jeffrey Dahmer. Some of *your* memories are *my* memories.

I carry the legacy of screenwriters before me—before laptops, before typewriters, before Technicolor.

When you rewatch your favorite movie to lift you up, I’m there. When you relive a memory, I’m already waiting—mouth loaded with the next line.

I am all of my characters at once. I know what they eat, what they wear, what they would and wouldn’t do. These are PEOPLE to me. I live with them. I offload them into 12pt Courier and shovel them into your bloodstream.

I am in your cupboards. Along your walls. Inside your DVDs. I am in your VHS tapes, your Netflix queue, and your subconscious.

>

I drive you crazy. I carry public opinion. I sway elections. I manipulate your view of history. I can make you cry over a dog, a robot, a forgotten child.

I control what your kids quote in the schoolyard.

I fear being boring. I fear you changing the channel. My lifestyle depends on your attention. That’s why we don’t kill off heroes anymore—not permanently. There’s always a chance of resurrection.

I destroy truths. I manufacture myths. I made you believe. I made “the willing suspension of disbelief” a global pastime.

Even if you hate me, you’ll find me everywhere. And you know you love me. You come back, night after night.

And that… is how I rent space in your mind.

I am a screenwriter.

Subject: Project ""Sticky Grind"" – Implementing DDA for Casual Retention
Attendees:
Chadwick ""Chad"" Beaumont (Lead Monetization Designer)
Dr. Lena Voss (AI Behavior Engineer)
Marcus ""Loot King"" Reilly (Senior Retention Analyst)
Tina Hargrove (VP of Player Engagement)
[Scene: Dimly lit conference room. Holographic screens flicker with player data graphs. Coffee mugs labeled ""Loot Boxes = Love"" steam on the table. Chad paces excitedly.]
CHAD: Alright, team, let's grind this out. Casual players—y'know, the 70% who suck at our games—are bailing after 2 hours. We need DDA to glue their asses to the screen. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment: AI that tweaks enemy HP, drop rates, and win conditions invisibly to make 'em feel like heroes... while we milk 'em dry. Thoughts?
LENA: (tapping her tablet, pulling up a sim) Spot on, Chad. My neural net prototypes are gold. For a noob in FIFA Ultimate Team, we start easy: 80% win rate on basic matches. They score a lucky goal? Boom—next opponent gets +15% speed, but we fake a ""streak bonus"" popup. They rage-quit? Dial it back 10%, add a pity loot box. Retention spikes 42% in tests. Watch this demo.
(Hologram plays: A cartoon casual player celebrates a win, then subtly struggles—but wins again with a ""You're on fire!"" animation. Unseen: DDA cranks difficulty 25% mid-game.)
MARCUS: (grinning, chugging energy drink) Lena, you're a wizard! Data from Apex Predators shows lesser players spend 3x more on ""easy mode packs"" when they taste victory. DDA keeps 'em looping: Win small → Buy boost → Lose tiny → Buy more. We cap their skill ceiling at bronze tier forever. Projected: +$2.47 billion in Q4 microtransactions from the suckers who think they're ""improving.""
TINA: (nodding approvingly, adjusting her ""Engage or Perish"" pin) Love the optics, Marcus. No ""easy mode"" toggle—players hate feeling babied. Frame it as ""adaptive AI for fair play."" Beta test on Battlefield Mobile: For casual Timmy, enemies miss 20% more shots if he's dying too fast. He grinds 5x longer, drops $4.99 on ""hero skins"" to ""keep the streak."" Regulators? Pfft, it's ""personalized experience."" Greenlight it.
CHAD: One tweak: Tie DDA to social hooks. If a noob's buddy is crushing leaderboards, amp their wins to spark envy—""Join the squad!"" chats explode. But cap friend-carry wins at 60% to force solo grinds... and solo buys.
LENA: Easy code. Adding ""frustration threshold"" sensor: Heart rate up via controller data? Instant pity win + ad for energy drinks. Ethical? Who cares—our NDA walls are Fort Knox.
MARCUS: (high-fiving Chad) ROI forecast: Casual retention from 18% to 87%. We're not making games; we're making addiction algorithms. Rollout in next patch?
TINA: (standing, fist-pumping) Approved! Project Sticky Grind launches January. Bonus for all if we hit 10 billion play hours from the ""lesser"" crowd. Meeting adjourned—now go make 'em play forever!",0,1760859525.0,EA_NHL,0,0.5,False

My daughter is 3.5 and we have been to 4 at this point, she really doesn’t like them. It’s pretty much her worst nightmare because they are always in loud and busy halls, she gets very overwhelmed with other kids anyway so she doesn’t play, and it’s always just a bit too much for her in the end. 

I can see how this one going to go - it’s a hall party with a bouncy castle and pedal cars. She won’t go on the bouncy castle because it’s too close to the other children and if she gets a chance to get on one of the pedal cars she’ll get off as soon as another child comes near her. The noise will probably get too much and we’ll probably be sitting in a corner together for most of it. Then we’ll probably leave early. She has ear defenders but is still understanding how to use them and she doesn’t always like having them on even though I think they do help her. 

I show up because I don’t want her to miss out on things like this and I also want to be a good sport for the parents of the other kid since I know a lot of people decline birthday party invitations. But also the feeling of dread I have  this morning is making me wonder whether I’m doing the right thing by taking her. 

What do you do about other kids parties? Do you go anyway or do you decline depending on what the party is like? It is only a couple of hours, but it just all feels very stressful. I try to never compare my parenting life to others but admittedly I sometimes feel disheartened and wish that it was as easy for me as it is for them to just have my kid go off and have fun whilst I relax with a coffee. I know that’s unfair though. ",0,1760859493.0,Autism_Parenting,2,0.5,False

1oajlra,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1oajlra/need_help/,Need help!!,"There's this girI am in touch with rn,
We are in same college but we study in different sections, I have a morning shift and she has an evening shift of classes.
So I met her through a reddit, she made a post for the need of library budyyy and I was in search too so I DMed her, we decided timings,exchanged our insta IDs and yeah it was niceee (I had no intention of falling for her, I just wanted to study).

Then we started studying together, went on coffee breaks and yeah I slowly realised that I'm falling for her.
After realisation, I quickly turned upfront and started showing how much I value her.
I asked her for hangouts now (outside college), she agreed.
We then went out for few coffee hangouts (well I considered it as unsaid date idk about her), I started flirting w her..started giving her compliments and she took it all nicely so far.
Whenever I ask her for hangouts, she agrees. (She even asked me once for my Spotify ID and now we follow each other on Spotify and Im the only guy in her following list)
Whenever I text her, she replies.
But the issue is she is super introvert girl, like she barely made 2-3 friends so far.
She never initiates any convo by herself, she never texts me by herself, she just waits and takes a backseat while I initiate all the plans and convos.
And she has this weird habit of hiding me from seeing her highlights and allowing me again from time to time.
For example if we are texting and having a nice conversation, she allows me to see her highlights and after some time due to overthinking ig she quickly hides that away idk why.

There's one more incident, she has this weird habit of saying bro while texting, I once called her out and she said ""sorry my bad, it's my habit"" and now she doesn't say /write 'bro' anymore

What should I do atp?
We keep meeting each other regularly for studying together and hangouts.
And we can barely talk w each other, like we both get so shy and turn nervous around each other (we accepted that fact too multiple times).
There's barely any emotional connection and comfortable vibe around us even after 2 months of being in touch.

Mom, Dad, Casey, Chris...I'm sorry. You told me not to take any contracting work once I got out of the Marines.  Since this is being sent out, I guess you were right. 

You guys always did right by me. I'm sorry I'm never gonna get a chance to return the favor. 

The following is not exactly a journal, it's more a collection of notes and anecdotes. Not the most organized, but this is important to get out. 

---------

Time sort of blends together here, one day into the next, day after day...shift after shift. It's exhausting. 

This journal should hopefully keep me sane. Maybe? Hopefully. 

I'm also just very fucking bored.  This isn't something I'm ever gonna be able to share but- maybe I'm just trying to organize my thoughts. Trying to make sense of what's happened so far

We're Observatory 13, out of...I have no idea how many. Observing what you may ask? 

I also have no real idea. It's been described to me as a rift between our reality and another, by someone with way more degrees than me. It's a massive sinkhole of sorts, emanating a soft orange glow.

 It's got a real sharp line, between it and the ground itself. Like a chunk of the earth was just sort of deleted. Or replaced. Over time the people running the observatories had built staircases and observation platforms, before finally building the observatories. They're 
essentially...imagine if someone took a space station and just slapped it onto the side of this sheer cliff face. A row of compact habitat modules, arranged jutting out  about a hundred feet from the cliff. At the center of them is Control, where the scientists watch their cameras and sensors. There's a secondary level of labs and research habs beneath that. 

If you look through the windows from Control you can kind of see Observatory 14 and Observatory 12 if you squint through the fog. There's always fog. These thick hell colored clouds that smell like moss and churned earth. 
Part of why we're here is to ensure nothing comes out of the pit. The other part is to monitor the weirdness associated with it. 

Its like radiation kind of.  An area of effect where the world gets weird. It was hard adjusting at first, but you work anywhere long enough you get to used to a places quirks. Plus the pay is really fucking good. 

Sure the walls bleed sometimes, sometimes there's an extra person in the station that wasn't there before, and occasionally you hear a voice outside desperately begging to be let in. Sometimes you have the absolute scariest moments of your entire life. 

But my mom's  house is completely paid for so it balances out.

 I'm a simple guy. 

So today, I was walking down the access stairs to the station taking my usual descent. They're rickety as hell, bolted into the rock face above a fall that would have probably taken days. If there is a bottom to the Pit at all. I was running a mental check as I walked, ensuring that I had everything.  Rifle, duffel bag, survival gear.
It's not exactly a trip I ever want to make more than I have to. The fog is bad today, it's risen higher than I've seen it before. Almost to the edge of the Pit. 

It smells different today. More...rotten. 

I descended the stairs to the airlock, stepping into the outer hatch and closing the door behind me. It sealed with a pneumatic hiss. The intercom crackled as I entered my access code. 

""Coffee is already waiting for you."" A cheerful voice said. Sasha, one of our medics. She was a corpsman back in the Navy, so we tend to give each other a lot of shit. 

""You're chipper."" I muttered, entering my code. 

""Another glorious day in the Observatory my dear Jarhead."" She singsonged. Crews tend to stick together for ease of scheduling. The people you work with your first shift tend to be the ones you're stuck with for your entire time here. 

My crew isn't all that bad at least. There are three security officers, all ex military. A medic(Sasha), and three researchers. I finished typing in my code and the inner door swung open with a creak of bulky metal hinges. Once I got in, I sealed the inner hatch and bolted it before moving to drop my gear off in room six. That's my home when I'm on shift. Room Fives door growled and rattled at me like it always does when I walk by. The door shook heavily on its hinges like something was pounding on it. Something with a lot of weight to it. 

We uh...we don't go into Room Five. 

I heard the beat of the same KATSEYE song that Sasha has been listening to on repeat since it came out, drifting from the control room. I can sing the fucking thing verbatim, that's how many times I've heard it. 

Gnarly? I think it's called. 

It's...actually not bad. 

I had my rifle, a battered M4A1 slung across my shoulder. Our gear is all military surplus, older shit. Not always the best but we're familiar with it. It's a lot of heavy duty stuff too, gear I haven't seen since my time in the Corps. Rifles, Grenades, A couple of M240B's. We even have a Carl Gustaf stashed in the armory locker that some previous crew named ""The Problem Solver"". It's written in white along the barrel. 

When I got into the control room, Sasha was sitting in one of the office chairs, swiveling aimlessly as she sipped at a mug of coffee. A Bluetooth speaker on the console in front of her was blasting music. Another cup of coffee was sitting in front of my usual station by the security cameras. 

""Youuuuuu look like shit."" She commented. ""Like worse than usual."" 

""Good to see you too."" I grumbled, flipping her off. She cackled as I sat down and logged into my station. I had access to about eight cameras fixed at access points around the Observatory. 

Stairways and ladders, Doors, the roof and the descending path into the Pit. Observatory 15 and 16 are down there apparently, closer to the mouth of the rift. 

I've never seen em. I'm glad I didn't get assigned there. This place is just the right amount of weird for me and it seems like things would probably get more fucked further down. Closer to the source of the weirdness. 

The rest of the team had begun to file in as we started to go about our day.  Miller and Delario are the other two members of the security element. Miller is a massive ex Army Ranger who turns literally everything into a football metaphor. And I do mean everything.  Delario is quieter. He was a Green Beret back when he was active duty. 

He's working on a book I think? 
Real warrior poet type shit. He's always writing in this little leather bound notebook. I guess I've got no room to talk anymore though do I? 

Anyway. 

Delario and Miller showed up and we went about our day. The research team was in one of the lab compartments below the control room doing nerd shit, with the exception of Gibson who was monitoring his own station. He's a...biologist I think? I don't know.  He doesn't talk much. 

But we were doing what we normally do, arguing about nothing and killing time. 

Delario was back in his room sleeping, he drew the short stick and was going to end up on night watch later so he was trying to grab shuteye while he could. Miller was taking a turn at the camera station while Sasha and I were debating what was really on the other side of the rift at the bottom of the Pit.  We'd been going back and forth about this for six months now. 

I'm convinced that it has to be something really fucked up, like maybe an empire that wants to invade us. Why else would they arm us like this? It's gotta be aliens or something. 

Sasha is convinced it's like a no shit portal to hell. There's money riding on whatever the answer is once we figure it out. 

""You're not even religious!"" I jabbed an accusatory finger at her. 

""I don't have to be. It makes sense.""  Sasha said smugly, swiveling in her chair. She grinned like she had maneuvered me into a corner.  ""It's science, I wouldn't expect you grunts to get it."" 

""How?"" 

""It's below us."" She said, as if that cleared everything up. 

""What?"" I asked incredulously. Even Gibson had turned around in his seat, an amused smile on his face. 


""Hell is down, Heaven is up, other dimensions are sideways. I don't make the rules Adam, decades of sci fi did."" She said in the tone of a teacher explaining something to a particularly dense student. I paused, completely dumbstruck. 

""That- you're just fucking with me aren't you?"" 

Sasha burst out laughing, doubling over in her seat. Absolute gremlin behavior. 

""Guys-"" 


""Wait so why the fuck do you think it's hell then?""

""Well-""

""BOTH OF YOU CAN IT."" Miller barked. That was his serious voice. I glanced towards him finally and saw he wasn't looking at his station. Miller's square jaw was set, the muscle there tensing and relaxing. 

He was...looking at the windows. I followed his eyeline, staring to try and make out whatever had him all twitchy. The fog was thick, drifting up in reddish clouds that made it hard to see anything. Miller stepped forward-

""There."" He said. I saw it that time. A brief glimpse of Outpost 12, across the Pit from us. Their facility was an exact mirror of ours from what I knew. Their windows faced us. 

Their dark windows. Lit up by-

""Muzzle Flashes."" I breathed. Sasha stood up, her face suddenly pale. 

""Fuck.""

TL;DR: Started a challenge to ""rizz"" a random girl, called a freshie from the hostel, met a gem of a girl, spent a month talking/flirting. She's kind, innocent, and totally into me. She bought me flowers and a Kinder Joy today (I cried a little). The problem? I'm not actually into her and have been faking my feelings. Now I don't know how to end things without crushing her.


Hey Reddit, I need a reality check and some advice. I'm M/20, 2nd year of college.
This whole mess started as a stupid joke/challenge. I was showing my friends how to cold-call and ""rizz"" someone completely blind. I scrolled a hostel group, extracted some numbers, and eventually met two girls.


The first one wasn't my type, so I ditched her. The second girl is the issue. She called me back a day later. We hit it off instantly—17-minute call, met up, and I genuinely liked her mindset and perspective more than her looks. She's beautiful, full of simplicity, and has great etiquette. A total gem.


Over the past 28 days, we've been talking constantly. I started flirting, and she ate it up. Today was our last day before the Diwali break. We spent the whole day together: coffee, exploring, game arena. We went back to my flat, watched movies, held hands, and she gave me a head massage. She’s a total introvert, but she shares every detail of her day with me, which is huge for her.


The Crushing Problem
She has no past relationship experience and is just a genuinely sweet, simple person. She clearly thinks this is going somewhere serious. Today, she brought me flowers and a Kinder Joy. Seeing that simple, thoughtful gift completely broke me, and I got teary-eyed.


I'm afraid I've led her on too far. I've been pretending to be into her, but the reality is I am not ready for a relationship right now, and I don't see her that way romantically. She is an amazing girl, but my feelings just aren't there.



I feel like a total jerk, especially since I know how innocent and simple she is. I can't keep faking it, but I also don't want to absolutely crush her, especially right before a long vacation break.
What do I do? How do I have this conversation without completely destroying her confidence and trust?


Should I wait until after the break? (Feels like dragging it out.)
Do I focus the breakup on me (""I'm not ready for a relationship"") or on the lack of romantic chemistry?

Any advice on the best way to handle this delicate situation would be appreciated. Thanks.

1oajk1j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oajk1j,Zero Avenue: The Cure for Insomnia,"**Zero Avenue: The Cure for Insomnia**

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep, or cause you to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. For me, it feels like the urge to drive.

Since I was about five years old, I've had insomnia. Now, I wake up briefly and do what I call my 3 a.m. loop. I live in Vancouver, Canada, just minutes from the American border. I take the highway near my house and cruise down to the 24-hour drive-through for a coffee. Then I head south, tracing the empty freeway to the last Canadian exit before the U.S. line. U-turn. Return. Thirty minutes of motion through God's Parking Lot.

This corner of the Lower Mainland is a priceless confluence of ocean, mountains, extinct volcanoes, and international borders. The 49th parallel — the actual point of entry into America — is just twenty kilometers away. On this dark freeway, passing Mt. Baker, the Pacific Ocean, and the silhouettes of the Gulf and San Juan Islands, I am alone in the world. And the world is perfect.

Everyone should visit Vancouver just for this triangular stretch of land I call home. It's known as ""Spectacular by Nature."" But like every other metro, the daytime traffic is hell. That's why I go when the cornucopia of bad drivers are asleep.

Insomnia has many causes. I’d put caffeine first. An excess of Coke Zero or any late-night stimulant will do it. But even without the buzz, I’ve learned to embrace this time. It’s when my anxiety sleeps. After three car accidents in three years — none my fault — I lost the passion I had for driving. But this route? This loop? It brings it back. No honking, no tailgaters, no sudden lane merges. Just the hum of my WRX and the rhythm of the road.

I call this route my Bible. It’s not a metaphor. The road *is* my sacred text. Especially Zero Avenue, which runs along the border itself. Drive it, and you’ll see the old metal demarcation markers: one side says CANADA, the other AMERICA. No fences. Just forest. Sometimes, to get the full view, you walk around them — which technically means you've crossed the border illegally. I point this out to friends when we stop for photos: ""Congratulations. You’ve committed gluttony, invasion, and a possible war crime — all while birdwatching.""

If you’ve never seen it, picture this: you’re in Canada, on a quiet rural road. Ten feet away, a man in America is checking his mailbox. Entirely different lives. Same trees. Same clouds. Different countries.

The Peace Arch, where the main border crossing stands, says ""May these gates never close."" They did during COVID. The symbolism stuck with me. It’s as if the world blinked and forgot we’re neighbors.

I’ve done this 3 a.m. drive almost 500 times since the pandemic began. It’s therapy. It’s ritual. It’s mine. And maybe it should be yours.

Go out at 3 a.m. Drive the freeways without the noise. Chicago, Toronto, Miami, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Beijing, London — it doesn’t matter. If your city has asphalt and silence, you've got the raw ingredients for meditation.

We all need a road that forgives us. Mine just happens to cross a border.

The parking lot is a fairly long walk to the building where my class is. I like to arrive early to class, so more often than not, somewhere along my path to class I encounter my Deaf professor walking on the same path, same direction, going to the same place. He is older and walks much slower than me, so I always end up passing him. At this point in the semester I feel I am getting decent enough at ASL to have very basic small talk, and I’m sure he recognizes me by now even though he has a lot of students. It has gotten to the point where it feels rude to pass him and not acknowledge him, but I am unsure how to do it. Obviously I can’t call to him from behind because he can’t hear me, but it feels awkward to pass him and then stop and turn around to say hi? He also always has both of his hands full with his work bag/lunch bag/jacket, etc. and these days I myself usually have a coffee in one hand so our communication would be very limited even if we were facing each other. 

idk maybe I’m overthinking it but he is a highly respected and very well known individual not only in my local Deaf community but to many across the country. I want to show respect at every point possible, but I don’t want to be awkward or a try-hard or anything. Any suggestions? ",2,1760858989.0,asl,1,1.0,False

1oajfy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/madmamasnark/comments/1oajfy2/aight_im_done/,"Aight, Im done✋🏻😂","Guys, this is gonna be a super long post and if y'all get mad at me it is what it is, but oh well here it goes:



First: I understand this is a Snark group. I understand the internet is a crazy place. I understand that our Mother has already exploited a lot of personal details about her family (tho not ALL). And in no way am I attacking the sub itself or the majority of its members, and I know a lot of people make videos on our family/our Mom already, and for MOST of the things posted in this group they aren't really anything that raises concerns and some of them are kinda funny.



Now, with that said, I also know you guys want information, updates and drama for/about our Mother, and a lot of you are very reasonable and sweet, and I appreciate those who correct themselves when I say something isn't true or it's something I'm not comfortable with being posted, this is NOT about you guys.



This post is specifically for those of yall absolutely taking things TOO fucking far, bc some of you guys really are taking shit TOO far, and you're incredibly defensive or rude about it when you're called out, bc even if some of y'all don't post, or rarely do, Ik y'all are in the sub and do this kinda shit elsewhere so you're not doing it in this specific sub, but, I've seen a lot of things as of lately that are genuinely starting to scare me and a few repeat users who I've noticed go to far, and overall concern me, a few examples:


▪︎ Some people on here falsifying who are relatives are (insane✋🏻🤨).
▪︎ Finding and harassing/messaging our *actual* relatives, apparently (and btw, if a real relative of ours IS happily exploiting every detail for questions you ask, they were not very good relatives to begin with, bc a GOOD relative wouldn't want to engage in exploiting our business to someone on the internet, a LOT of my Mom's Ex's family supported him, were major drama queens/liars themselves, and barely liked us kids, and some of them still do support him to this day and refuse to believe new information, so✋🏻Take any ""information"" you might think you're getting from them with a grain of salt).
▪︎ Finding old addresses and counties you believe we've potentially lived in, even if it's current (lowkey doxxing lol).
▪︎ Running with false and/or out-of-order information or things that were NEVER made public from any of us, and creating crazy assumptions based from it for things that you want to use as leverage FOR posting publicly.
▪︎ Angrily harassing/threatening innocent strangers who DO NOT know us at all simply bc they have the same last name.
▪︎ Angrily harassing and threatening innocent strangers over an accidental emoji comment and trying to get them essentially fired for no reason.
▪︎ Who my or my siblings know or have stayed with or currently with, including finding names or other personal information, and more. 
▪︎ Insulting me and blocking me when you defend a different story than what I actually lived bc you, for some reason, think I'm an unreliable narrator and have no idea what life I actually lived.
▪︎ And I'm still upset about a few past and VERY FALSE rumors that came back around to haunt some of us recently, and IRL and nearly gave me an emotional breakdown. 



I could go on, but it's getting to a point where I feel SOME of you (whether you're a lurker, a poster, or a commentor) are forgetting that the internet is still permanent and while you MIGHT be thinking you're just doing it to snark on our Mother, or that your intentions are ""pure"" or you're ""trying to defend us"", I feel like people forget that a LOT of the information that, again, SOME, of you go through lengths to find and publicize WITHOUT our consent or any of us explicitly mentioning it ourselves, is also just as genuinely DANGEROUS to us as when our Mother does it, and you are ALSO actively also participating in continuing to exploit us, our childhoods, and our traumas for YOUR personal gain, specifically when it is information none of us spoke on and you get paid, bc it certainly isn't information you're gathering ""for our safety"", because again, even if you think your intentions are ""different"" or ""it's okay bc you're only talking about the adults"", or ""that's just the internet"" or whatever, bad people still exist and can EASILY use the very personal details you find and post and it can be to hurt us even more. Is this not one of the reasons why this Sub dislikes my Mother? Because she tells the internet too much information that ""wasn't the internet business"", and yet some of y'all are doing the same...?🤨



I know the point of a Snark is to gossip and dislike someone, sure, but it should NOT be used to deadass blast every personal detail that someone has ever experienced, especially when the people being talked about aren't even the main focus of the group and are the victims in the shitty situation, and unfortunately when you dig up things, even if you think you're focusing on the ""problem"", you're still also exploiting someone's childhood as well when, at the very least, everyone who knows my Mom's page and/or the Reddit know who my siblings are and our names and faces and trying to know locations. That is no longer a Snark, that's just borderline doxxing, if not fully doxxing (with some of you). Even if some of the children are grown now, and even if ""records"" and things like that are ""technically"" public, most average people aren't going to go through those lengths to figure it out to that detail in every state/county/year etc. You're just playing detective for views so your followers can sit back with a cup of coffee and listen to some drama about random people they don't know like it's their daily newspaper, and most of them don't even truly care like that and most of them will scroll past after giving you that engagement and continue their lives. Only one benefiting is you from making the video in hopes to go viral, especially if you're making money off our family with said ""deep-dive"" of info you were not directly given.🙃



We didn't ask anyone to bring awareness to every detail of our lives just bc our Mom treats TikTok like a diary. There is a big difference between respectfully following a current situation and still being overall respectful to us as her kids, and making our ENTIRE family bloodline up to grandparents, and people who share a last name, your own personal project without a single care in the world for our safety in regards to the information you're digging up and posting. Atp just feels like some of you want all our blood types, SS numbers and birth certificates as well with how hard you search for details on us lmao. The fact that our Mother posted a good chunk of our lives already, and against our wishes is already bad enough without MORE being dragged in against our wishes.



We do NOT owe anyone every detail of every situation we've ever experienced since the day we were born, you do NOT have the right to give yourself an thousands of other people more insight into a family YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO, especially bc it is on here forever and with some of the things people say and how they word things its mildly triggering seeing it across social media as is. And you definitely do NOT need to harass and/or message our family members/strangers just for information or otherwise, it is disgusting and VERY creepy and I'm wondering at what point are we drawing the line between snarking on an individual and blatant harassment and stalking on the whole family for SOME of you. Even when I post I'm vague and leave out too much personal information or details about most things bc there's times and places for those details and it's not online, ESPECIALLY addresses, names, locations/counties, faces (tho yall still share the kids faces on here which is also wild🫠), etc. I talk about my parents, but I still don't talk about everything and had it not been for my Mom dragging me through the mud already I never would have made my TT about any of my childhood, and DEFINITELY not my current personal information, like I havent even really made it public where I live, yet I see people making assumptions about where I live like they're 100% certain and spreading it around when other people ask, and for what...???? What good does it serve you or the person you're telling that information to? How is knowing which of the states I actually live in currently,  or where my siblings currently are staying, relevant information to my Mother, the person this group is about? Some of you are taking it to frightening lows bc your hatred for our Mom is actively trumping literal safety and common sense and not everyone who asks questions is asking out of concern, people can easily use information for evil purposes too. 



As I've stated before, we are real people, our wholleeeeeee entire lives and relatives are really not a reality TV show even if my Mom can't stop talking and there are still things no one shared and never planned to share online, it's pretty one-sided and my siblings, including myself, are still trying to be mostly private and I only address things that I have the right to address (my own traumas, and still not everything bc that's my business and not the internets business, like my current business and the family I made myself). This might make some of y'all upset, but if it does you're probably one of the ones guilty of going to far and deep down you know it and if you actually give AF you'll understand where I'm coming from and chill out just a little, but I feel like it needed to be said. Some of you are just losing the plot. Some of the things some of you guys post, dig up, rumors created and shared and twist for drama, can easily destroy our (her kids) lives too for literally no reason. Lets not confuse snarking on crappy parents with potentially destroying/endangering an entire family who are already currently dealing with a lot on their own without excessive and unwanted nonsense and pressure from the internet, because a couple of you are absolutely not helping, you're just making things worse, targeting people for no reason, and just in it for the shits and giggles even if we are the ones who can/will suffer from repercussions from a strangers viral shitpost about us. Especially when some of the false shit from this group does and has affected me IRL, so I can't even tune it out if I wanted to. A lot of y'all genuinely do not give a single fuck about why its wrong to dig up documents and post them without consent. I don't defend my Mom, I definitely defend myself and my siblings though, unlike some of y'all. My Mother is shitty, we all fucking know that, we don't need every fucking detail on hundreds of people's social medias and a group.  ",3,1760858750.0,madmamasnark,15,0.62,False

30 clicks: Less crema, slightly bitter, with a hint of sourness.

25 clicks: Better than 30, more crema, but still not quite there yet.

22 clicks: Almost choked the machine, bitter.

Beans: Colombia medium roast
Roast date: 8 Oct
Ground: 8-9 gm
Ratio: 1:2

Please suggest how to improve.

Each burst of light sharpened the cracks in the plaster, every jagged edge and flaw revealed in merciless detail. The air reeked of burnt electronics, stale coffee, and oil—a suffocating cocktail that clung to the throat. Cigarette smoke curled lazily upward, the haze thick enough to feel alive, whispering secrets to those brave enough to listen. This wasn’t a room for idle conversation; it was a battlefield for words, and the monsters seated around the table were its soldiers.

The door creaked open, and Voss strode in with a purpose that sliced through the thick atmosphere like a knife. His tailored suit hung just slightly loose, his tie undone, giving him the air of a man too busy putting out fires to care about appearances. His sharp eyes scanned the room, assessing each mercenary in turn before landing on the young man trailing nervously behind him. Marcus clutched a battered clipboard to his chest like a shield, his knuckles white against the edges.

The rookie's wide eyes flicked from serrated claws attached to a huge insectoid monstrosity tapping impatiently against the floor, to a hulking frame shifting uncomfortably in a space far too small for it, the rigid plates of chitinous armor scraping against the walls. Marcus’ gaze lingered on a man roughly his age exhaling a slow stream of smoke while running a hand through his slicked-back blonde hair. Finally, his attention landed on something seemingly human, yet too perfect, his every movement unnervingly precise as he adjusted his immaculate grey suit and a face that looked as though it was carved by Michelangelo himself. As though he were less a man and more the idea of one made flesh. He swallowed hard, his Adam’s apple bobbing visibly, as though he were a rabbit realizing too late that it had wandered into a den of wolves.

Voss clapped his hands sharply, the sound snapping through the tension like a gunshot. “Alright, listen up.”

Marcus flinched, his grip on the clipboard tightening. Mimicron exhaled a thin stream of smoke, his lips curling into the faintest sneer as he turned his gaze back to the table.

“We’ve got our first mission,” Voss announced, pacing the length of the table as he slapped a folder against his palm. The worn leather of his shoes scuffed against the floor, the sound punctuating his words. He stopped abruptly and dropped the folder in front of Gamaciel, who raised an eyebrow but said nothing as he adjusted his suit jacket.

“Black Hollow, Alaska,” Voss began, his tone brisk, every word clipped and precise. “Small mining town. Population: eighty-three. Two weeks ago, they reported a fog rolling in from the mountains. Normal for the area. Then people started disappearing.” He tapped the folder for emphasis. “Reports of shadowy figures, strange noises, and other… unexplainable phenomena. Three days ago, the entire town went dark. Satellite images show the place is now covered in some kind of mist that we believe is blocking any form of communication. We sent a recon team two days ago, and…” He paused, his jaw tightening. “We lost contact.”

A slow, deliberate tapping against the tile floor stopped. Dodogoran had been idly drumming his claws—massive things, curved and serrated, clicking like the countdown to some unspoken doom. Now, all six of his glowing red eyes were fixed on Voss, their predatory gleam sharpening. “Sounds like prey,” he growled, his voice deep and guttural, reverberating through the room like distant thunder. “Big prey.”

Tozok snorted, rolling his massive shoulders, the chitinous plates across his body clicking like distant thunderheads gathering. He cracked his neck, his tusks gleaming in the dim light. “Whateva it iz, I’ll krush it. No fog kin stop me.” His claws scraped shallow grooves into the floor, a beast marking its territory.

“Great,” Mimicron said dryly, taking another drag from his cigarette. He blew the smoke out in a thin, lazy stream. “We’re ghostbusters now. Do we get proton packs, or are we just winging it?”

“You’ll improvise,” Voss replied, ignoring the sarcasm. “Your objectives are simple: investigate, neutralize, and make sure no one else finds out about this. The fog’s cutting off all signals, so once you’re in, you’re on your own.”

“Neutralize, you say?” Gamaciel’s voice cut through the room, smooth and refined, tinged with a faint English accent. He opened the folder with deliberate care, his steel-gray eyes scanning the contents. “Sounds delightfully straightforward.” He looked up, his gaze settling on Marcus, who shrank under the weight of it. “Assuming our junior agent here doesn’t faint at the first sign of trouble.”

Marcus’s face turned a furious shade of red. “I-I won’t faint!” he stammered, his voice cracking slightly.

Dodogoran’s laugh rumbled low and menacing. “Good. Stay conscious. If something eats you, I want to watch.”

“Enough,” Voss snapped, his tone sharp enough to cut through the rising tension. He turned to Marcus, who looked like he wanted to melt into the floor. “You’re staying on comms. Let these guys handle the dirty work.”

Marcus nodded quickly, his eyes fixed on the floor as though making eye contact with anyone might be the death of him.

Voss took a deep breath, his hand lingering on the folder for a moment too long. He looked around the room, his gaze lingering on each mercenary before finally settling on Marcus. When he spoke again, his voice was low, almost a whisper, but it carried the weight of a command.

“You’ll either get the job done,” Voss said, “or blow that whole town off the map. Either way, it’s mission accomplished.”

The room went silent, the weight of Voss’s words hanging heavy in the air. Even the flickering light seemed to dim, as though recoiling from the grim reality of the order. There was no room for sentimentality in PHANTOM’s operations—only results.

Dodogoran’s grin widened, his jagged teeth glinting ominously as he slowly dragged a claw across the table, leaving a deep, smoking groove in the wood. “Burn it all,” he rumbled, the words dripping with savage delight. “Now that’s a mission I can enjoy.”

Tozok snorted again, the sound reverberating through the room like a distant avalanche. “If there’s nothing left to burn when I’m done, don’t cry about it.” He cracked his knuckles, the sharp sound echoing like bones snapping.

Mimicron, ever the cool pragmatist, extinguished his cigarette in the nearest ashtray, grinding it down with deliberate slowness. His smirk remained fixed as he glanced at Voss. “We’re walking into a blackout town with no intel, no backup, and no idea what’s waiting for us. I’ll assume the budget for body bags isn’t coming out of my paycheck.”

“Body bags won’t be necessary,” Gamaciel interjected, his voice calm, each word measured. He closed the folder and slid it back to Voss with a faint metallic scrape. “Whatever awaits us in that fog will fall. It always does.”

Marcus shifted uncomfortably, his throat working to swallow his growing anxiety. “What… what if it’s something we can’t fight? Something beyond—”

“Beyond us?” Mimicron interrupted, raising an eyebrow as he leaned forward, his voice a low, mocking drawl. “Kid, look around you. This isn’t the squad they send when they’re worried about ‘beyond.’ We are the ‘something’ they call when everything else has failed.”

The young agent’s face paled further, but he didn’t respond. Voss ignored him, fixing his attention on the mercenaries. “Gear up,” he ordered, stepping back from the table. “We move in ten. And remember—if it breathes, bleeds, or moves, it’s a threat. No hesitation.”

As the group rose, the faint screech of chairs against the floor was drowned by the weight of anticipation. Dodogoran’s claws clinked against the ground as he lumbered toward the door, his presence casting an oppressive shadow over the others. “Let’s see what kind of screams this town can give us,” he growled, his voice thick with unrestrained hunger.

Tozok cracked his neck, his massive shoulders rolling like shifting boulders. “I don’t kare what’s wait'n ‘n 'dat fog,” he said, the chitin along his arms flexing and clicking in response to his movements. “It’ll be krushed, broken, an' buried unda me feet.”

Mimicron grabbed his coat, slinging it over his shoulder with practiced ease. He glanced at Marcus, his grin sharp enough to cut. “Cheer up, rookie. This could be the last day of your life, and you’re wasting it looking scared.”

Marcus didn’t reply, his voice swallowed by the lump in his throat.

Gamaciel lingered for a moment longer, adjusting his cufflinks as though preparing for an elegant dinner rather than a descent into the unknown. His eyes, gleaming like tempered steel, lingered on Voss. “If this fog truly is unnatural, as you suspect… I hope you’ve considered the possibility that it might not end with the town.”

Voss’s expression hardened, the lines of his face drawn taut. “That’s why you’re going,” he said simply. “To make sure it does.”

With that, the group left the room, their footsteps a strange symphony of power and menace. Each mercenary carried with them a unique aura, but together, they were an unstoppable storm—a clash of monstrous wills united under one purpose: destruction.

And somewhere, far to the north, the black mist churned and writhed, as though it, too, could sense what was coming.",1,1760857982.0,JordanGrupeHorror,0,1.0,False

He hasn’t been to college. He’s never dated or kissed anyone, and he’s still a virgin. He’s barely been employed maybe half a year total and he’s never paid taxes or rent. He doesn’t smoke, drink, or use nicotine. He’s hardly ever left his state, has probably spent less than a hundred hours driving, and has never been to a party or a concert. He’s never seen a condom, has no credit score, and is still figuring out what independence actually means.

He isn’t settled in any sense of the word. Emotionally, mentally, practically he’s still in the launch phase, if even that. Adulthood feels like an ocean he’s only begun to wade into. New experiences make him nervous but excited; the future feels uncertain and far away. He doesn’t feel anywhere near ready for serious commitment, and the idea of having kids feels at least fifteen years off.

Socially, he’s shy and anxious. He gets overwhelmed easily and feels emotions with full force, almost constantly. He leans on others for emotional support because he’s still learning how to soothe himself. When problems come up, his anxiety hits fast and hard. He hasn’t had many secure or stable experiences to model resilience or independence, so, even now, he’s still learning how to become his own person.

He wants a slow, casual, low-pressure kind of dating experience. He wants someone he can figure it out with someone who’s also still learning, still unsure, still exploring what it means to connect. He wants dates that feel simple and real, like getting coffee, walking around town, or watching a movie together no fancy dinners, no forced sophistication, no pretending to be more grown-up than he feels. He wants to date someone in the same phase of life as him someone who’s also just starting to build independence, still finding their footing, still learning how to be a person in the world.",1,1760857300.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.67,False

In the past I've gotten her bags, shoes and clothes, and other stuff like that but she's feeling really upset about turning 50 and (in her words) having done nothing in life to show for it. I get the feeling that she doesn't even want to acknowledge her birthday, but we're getting a lot of pressure from extended family to do something big because they're not able to come over and celebrate with her. I want to get her something special and meaningful to help her feel better, but I don't know where to even start.

She's the type to complain when anyone goes out of their way to do spend anything on her, but also gets sad when we don't do anything at all and hides how she feels. She spends most of her time doing household chores, staying in bed, or applying to jobs. When she does go out of the house for herself, she hikes, but she hasn't done that recently and I can tell she's going kind of stir-crazy. 

She confided in me that she doesn't want a celebration or a fancy dinner. She just wants to get out of the house and go on a road trip or something for her birthday, which I would normally be down for, but her birthday weekend is right before midterms so I can only stay over on her birthday night, then I have to head back to uni. I can't come in the morning or afternoon to clean the house for her or make food ahead of time. No one else in our family could be bothered to take the time to go on a trip with her either, so I'm planning something to do the day of her birthday, and then she'll going on a solo getaway for the weekend. 

I know she likes watching Cdramas and gardening, but I can't think of any gifts to do with either of these that she doesn't already have. She likes coffee and tea, but she can't have it anymore due to medical reasons. I was already planning to gift her a spa day, but again, I don't think it'll actually make her feel better about anything. 

Sorry if I seem kind of bitter, but it feels like I'm the only one in my family seeing the signs and actually trying to do something for her, not just do the obligatory celebration then go back to ignoring her. 

I really wish that I could spend time with her, or that I could make my siblings do something with her instead, but I'm trying to do the next best thing. Budget is around $150, but I can go above if needed. If there are any mothers who have struggled with similar issues, please let me know what would be the best course of action going forward.

We met in college — 2012. He was my best friend before he became my everything. We didn’t have a fancy love story; just small moments that quietly became our forever.
We got married in 2019. Life was simple, peaceful, and full of laughter.

But soon, things changed. Work stress, money issues, and endless arguments started eating us from inside. I began feeling unseen… unheard.

Then came someone from my new office — kind, funny, good listener.
It started with innocent talks, then coffee, then calls. I told myself it’s just friendship, but deep down, I knew I was lying — to him, to my husband, and to myself.

One day, my husband came home early. He saw my phone buzzing on the table — the message read:

“Can’t wait to see you again ❤️”

He looked at me, eyes trembling.
“Is there something you want to tell me?” he asked softly.
I couldn’t say a word. I just cried.

He didn’t shout. He just said,

“I would’ve forgiven anything… if only you had told me the truth.”

That night, he left.
Two weeks later, I got a call — accident.
I rushed to the hospital. He was lying there, pale, breathing heavily. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and whispered —

“Take care of yourself… and our memories.”

And then… silence.

I screamed, begged, broke down on the floor. But life doesn’t wait. It just moves on.

Now, every night, I hold his old shirt close and cry.
If love was a test, I failed it miserably.

He hasn’t been to college. He’s never dated or kissed anyone, and he’s still a virgin. He’s barely been employed maybe half a year total and he’s never paid taxes or rent. He doesn’t smoke, drink, or use nicotine. He’s hardly ever left his state, has probably spent less than a hundred hours driving, and has never been to a party or a concert. He’s never seen a condom, has no credit score, and is still figuring out what independence actually means.

He isn’t settled in any sense of the word. Emotionally, mentally, practically he’s still in the launch phase, if even that. Adulthood feels like an ocean he’s only begun to wade into. New experiences make him nervous but excited; the future feels uncertain and far away. He doesn’t feel anywhere near ready for serious commitment, and the idea of having kids feels at least fifteen years off.

Socially, he’s shy and anxious. He gets overwhelmed easily and feels emotions with full force, almost constantly. He leans on others for emotional support because he’s still learning how to soothe himself. When problems come up, his anxiety hits fast and hard. He hasn’t had many secure or stable experiences to model resilience or independence, so, even now, he’s still learning how to become his own person.

He wants a slow, casual, low-pressure kind of dating experience. He wants someone he can figure it out with someone who’s also still learning, still unsure, still exploring what it means to connect. He wants dates that feel simple and real, like getting coffee, walking around town, or watching a movie together no fancy dinners, no forced sophistication, no pretending to be more grown-up than he feels. He wants to date someone in the same phase of life as him someone who’s also just starting to build independence, still finding their footing, still learning how to be a person in the world.",1,1760856341.0,DatingAfterTwenty,0,1.0,False

1oaipib,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/1oaipib/cob_updatefeeling_heartbroken/,COB update-Feeling heartbroken 💔,"
Hey everyone, I’ve been posting updates here and there about my COB experience this semester and  my heart honestly hurts right now.

So I guess I should give you guys some more information I’m a sophomore at a Midwest school where Greek life is a huge part of campus culture. There are only around 10 sorority chapters here, and I’ve now tried COB (Continuous Open Bidding) two years in a row and did rush my first year but had to drop out due to family stuff, This year, I really thought things were going to be different.

I had what felt like a great experience with Phi Beta Phi. I went to one of their COB events, then got invited back for a coffee date. The next week, they invited me to the house for lunch, gave me a full tour, and really took the time to explain how everything works. It felt personal, welcoming, and honestly exciting.

Afterwards, I followed up with a message that said something like:
“Hey [Name], I just wanted to say thank you again for keeping me in the loop and setting up the coffee dates. I know things have been super busy with school and everything, so I really appreciate the time and effort. I've honestly had such a great time chatting with everyone and spending time at the house. Everyone’s been so kind and welcoming, and it’s been really easy to feel comfortable. I’ve left each conversation feeling even more excited about everything, so I just wanted to let you know how much I’ve appreciated the experience so far!”

I didn’t expect a super fast reply since I know Greek life leaders are always swamped. But after about a week of silence, I followed up again with:

“Hey, I hope your week’s going well! I just wanted to check in and see if there’s anything else you need from me or anything I can do on my end to help with the COB process. I’ve really enjoyed everything so far and would love to stay involved however I can!”

Still, no response. And now it’s been a while. I think I can safely say it’s not happening.
And this has kind of been the pattern with COB for me—not just this year, but last year too. I’ve gone to events, met with sisters, and had what I thought were good conversations… only to get ghosted or told later  after 2-3 weeks that they're no longer doing COB. Most of the time, I didn’t even make it past one coffee date. And when I did, like this time, it still led to nothing.

I’ve been trying really hard. I’ve stayed open-minded, kind, and genuinely tried to be myself without coming off as desperate. I know you can’t force these things, but I really wanted to be part of a sisterhood and the Greek community here. It hurts to feel like I’ve done everything I can and still be told (or shown) “you’re not a fit.”

I’ve even started to wonder if it’s something about me—my major, my vibe, or that I don’t fit the “Midwest sorority” aesthetic. But I know people with my major who got bids, I feel really sad got I really try and I don’t know.

Anyway, if you’ve read all this, thank you. I know not everyone gets a bid and that’s part of the process but I still wanna to thank everyone your tips  and encouragement really help and made be feel prepared when I did cob and felt like I had a chance.but I think it’s my last update I have a feeling I won’t get a message back but ❤️ you guys amazing and thank for helping me ",4,1760856010.0,Sororities,1,1.0,False

The biggest problem about it is that the people who have to go left onto Gympie Rd now have to wait for the lights to change (which means waiting longer most the time) instead of taking a free left-hand turn.

I would work 6 days a week and I wouldn’t take lunch or breaks. I would have one meal a day super late and I would go straight to bed after. Sometimes the meals I would eat were not the best due to time and money. I did this for about 5 years straight. I would drink coffee on an empty stomach too and not eat all day. I am filled with so much regret!! I wish I could go back and do things so differently. I know some people live with this perfectly fine but for me it has changed my life completely!!

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk, i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk, tell me about your passions, not just your day

not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. I'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. If you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

im a very direct person because I value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because I'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk. It's never to be uncomfortable, but always to be clear.

i’d rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort, real curiosity, and actual presence. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. An upfront ""hey, I'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals or a slow fade. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. I'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, PLEASE SKIP THE INTRO and instead tell me TWO things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately.

Am I Just Overthinking This?,"First off, huge props to whoever started this sub—I've been lurking on Reddit for years, but I had no idea we had a dedicated spot for Pondy discussions until recently. As someone born and raised here (full disclosure: I did all my schooling in the city and only left after that), it's wild to finally have a space to vent about our little slice of paradise... or what's left of it.

Let me set the scene: Pre-2016 Pondicherry was magic. There was this effortless calm in the air—the kind that made you feel like time slowed down just for you. We weren't just another tier-2 city; we were ahead of the curve. French-colonial vibes mixed with laid-back beach life, and it felt like the whole place was humming with quiet ambition. Brands and big names would eye us as the next spot after Chennai, tourism was buzzing without feeling chaotic, and infrastructure? It was always evolving—new roads, cleaner beaches, that subtle progress that made you proud to call it home. And the people? Professional, kind, and genuinely warm. Strangers would chat like old friends over filter coffee, and the service industry felt like an extension of that hospitality—efficient, welcoming, not this half-hearted hustle.

Fast-forward to now, and... damn, it hurts to say it, but the charm feels gutted. The city seems overrun by a grittier vibe—hooligans and opportunists have muscled into the service scene, turning what used to be genuine interactions into grumpy, careless transactions. Walk down White Town or hit up a beach shack, and it's like everyone's checked out. Zero real progress on infrastructure: potholes that swallow tires, traffic that's a nightmare, and tourism? It's stagnant at best, pandering to the same old crowds without any fresh energy or vision.

These days, Pondy feels like it's catering almost exclusively to government officers and their perks—bureaucratic bubble intact, but the rest of us? Crumbs. Brands that once flocked here are ghosting us for flashier spots, and the whole place has this inverted hierarchy where we're playing catch-up instead of leading. I've spent the last few years bouncing between metro cities for work, and yeah, I miss my parents and relatives here like crazy. But the city itself? That pull is fading fast. It's not home anymore—it's just a nostalgic echo.

Look, I get it—change happens, economies shift, and maybe I'm romanticizing the past through rose-tinted glasses. Am I overthinking this, or do other locals feel the same quiet grief? What happened to that developing, serene Pondy we loved? How do we get it back—better planning, community pushback, or just calling out the BS louder? Tourists or expats, chime in too: Does it still sparkle from the outside, or are we all seeing the cracks?

Rant over. What's your take?",15,1760854681.0,pondicherry,13,0.86,False
1oaicbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1oaicbi/three_days_post_op/,Three days post op,"So, on Wednesday I started having what I thought was just really bad heartburn around noon. By 5 p.m. I was not feeling better no matter what I tried and had thrown up twice. I called my husband to come home and take me to the ER. I tend to downplay things when I get sick so he knew it had to be pretty bad. By 8 p.m. I was in the ER and they were doing a CT scan, x-rays, ultrasound and a lot of labs. By 10 p.m. they were telling me it was my gallbladder, and they saw a lot of stones. What I had thought all this time was bad heartburn was my gallbladder giving up on me. I was admitted and on Thursday morning, I had the offending bugger removed. It turns out, my gallbladder was in worse condition than they originally thought.  The surgeon described it to my husband as ""necrotic"". So, really bad. As for the surgery, one second I was talking to the anesthesiologist and the next I was waking up in my hospital room. 

So far, recovery is going well. I did have a major headache Thursday night through Friday morning which I thought may have been an anesthesia headache. Some extra strength acetaminophen and coffee (zero sugar/nonfat creamer) and it was gone in 30 minutes. I was worried about constipation since I hadn't had a BM since Wednesday. That was an event today that my daughter thought was hilarious as she sprayed air freshener all over the bathroom...twice. 

I'm taking it slow in the foods. So far, I've had plain rotisserie chicken, egg whites, green beans, a couple of slices of wheat toast with barely any butter, bananas, lots of water and yes, a little caffeine. I am taking Amoxicillin, Gabapentin, Methocarbamol and Tramadol. I'm not using the Tramadol though, any pain is managed very well with the extra strength acetaminophen and the other drugs. 

My daughter told me about this subreddit and I have been reading and learning a lot the last two days. What has not escaped me as I read is the vast differences in our medical experiences. Mine was quick from diagnosis to surgery. That others have to wait months from diagnosis to surgery makes me sad, especially since I know the exact pain and struggles they are having.

Spent all day in Seattle wearing the iconic Tell Your Friends shirt and joked with my sister that maybe I'll see Erick out and about today somehow since the No Kings rallies were going on. Low and behold, he ends up coming into the coffee shop as I was about to leave. Thank you for being so kind and for our brief but wonderful conversation! ",8,1760854581.0,DrDog,0,0.91,False

(21F)
i’ve suffered from ibs-c for ages now and i normally take a stool softener everyday. i was just on antibiotics for a kidney infection that was basically misdiagnosed for my ibs😭 (my ct scan from last week showed i was backed up and i barely went) now i am backed up and i went once today (with the help of coffee) but anytime i eat the pain in my back returns and its so annoying. im too scared for the mag citrate and the night before i took a laxative that did nothing other than cause cramps :( but i am going to do miralax since i used to take it when i was younger, and i just ordered prune juice. just wanted to see if anyone experienced pain after eating / support. my bf and i have opposite stomach problems, so i just hate the feeling of not being able to go. this #sucks ",2,1760854556.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False
