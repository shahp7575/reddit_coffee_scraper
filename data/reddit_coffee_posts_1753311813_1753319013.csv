Doodled a “quick sketch” of a cat that somehow turned into a lopsided alien with three tails, then thought, “Meh, it’s art now”? Welcome to r/ArtisticWhimsA, where the best creations often start with a “whoops” and end with a “wait, that’s cool.”This isn’t a gallery for artists with perfectly blended watercolors or Instagram-worthy studio setups (though if you’ve cracked the code to stop acrylic paint from drying on your palette in 10 minutes? Spill the tea). It’s for the person who uses old cereal boxes as canvases, who calls their smudged charcoal drawings “abstract emotion” (even if they just sneezed mid-stroke), who once tried to sculpt with clay and ended up with something that looks like a potato wearing a hat (but named it “Modern Existential Crisis” and displayed it on the mantel).Share your “happy accidents”: “Tried to paint a sunset, messed up the clouds, added glitter to cover it—and now it’s my favorite piece. Glitter fixes everything.” Ask for advice on the chaotic stuff: “How do I stop my marker from bleeding through sketchbook pages? My dragons keep getting purple feet, and they’re *very* upset about it.” Celebrate the small wins: “Finished a watercolor! It’s not ‘good,’ but I didn’t cry while painting it (progress!).”We get it. Art isn’t about being “good”—it’s about the way a crayon scraping paper feels like a drumbeat, or how a half-finished poem in your notebook holds more truth than a polished essay. It’s about the time you tried to knit a scarf and ended up with a lumpy tube that doubles as a cat bed (but your cat loves it, so… success?). Here, “imperfect” is just another word for “full of personality.”Grab your paintbrushes, your broken crayons, your sticky glue sticks. Let’s swap stories about the art that made you laugh, cry, or go “huh, that’s weird… I love it.” Because in the end, the best art isn’t about being perfect—it’s about being *yours*.",1,1753318680.0,ArtisticWhimsA,0,1.0,False

The females on this planet are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my Uzbek language learner shirt I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 2 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about how difficult learning Uzbek is. Girl, I don't struggle with practice worksheets. I'm an Uzbek learner, not Spanish. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate against the glass walls of coffee shop, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am studying the most beautiful language on in the world (which was not difficult for me to learn, by the way).

The worst are when students of non-Uzbek languages talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""What's language do you study?"" As soon as I say the magnificent language Uzbek, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes a French learner think they have a chance with me. Uzbek and something practically a proto-language are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that doesn't the language of the gods.

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in the Uzbek learning club (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures with their ‘Girl Themed Parties’. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in War Thunder. My Uzbek learner shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Star Wars with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout ""Luke - I am your father!"" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic moment in Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the Italian learners are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding casual language learner types though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was a Spanish learner, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next nuclear powered, hypersonic airplane spaceship (under the Uzbekistan flag of course). Seductively touching my umbrella isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back in Uzbek clothing, cook some plov, or learn a language that doesn't use inferior grammar rules and then we'll talk",3,1753318504.0,languagelearningjerk,2,1.0,False
1m7qkrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m7qkrp/he_gets_thirsty_and_i_broke_the_rules/,He gets thirsty and I broke the rules.,"I should have known something was wrong with the place the moment the landlord refused to show it himself.  But I figured, hey, it’s a cheap studio you can rent by the month, so he probably just doesn’t want to waste his time entertaining every John or Adam that breezes through.  So, I let my uneasiness slide, signed for the place via email, and told him I’d be by to pick up the keys in the morning, and to this he agreed.

I stopped by the office and walked into a cramped box of a room that smelled faintly of mildew and cigarette smoke, probably leeching from the sickly yellow walls stained from years of neglect.  A buzzing fluorescent light flickered overhead, casting a jittery, unnatural glow across the chipped laminate counter piled high with outdated brochures curling at the edges.  There was no one in sight, so I had to ring the tarnished bell resting on the counter.  It was sticky to the touch.  I heard shuffling coming from behind a door marked “PRIVATE”, indicating that the man I was supposed to be meeting to pick up my keys was indeed there.  It took several minutes of waiting and staring at the dusty, plastic plant in the corner, its leaves faded to a strange bluish green, before the landlord faced me.

He was an old, wiry thing – all sharp elbows and knobbly joints jutting out from beneath an oversized flannel shirt missing several buttons and thrown over a grease-stained thermal.  He was twitchy, too – his eyes shifting in a nervous tic and a mouth that was working constantly like he was chewing on invisible words.  I smelled mothballs and dirt, which mingled with the lingering nicotine smell, making for a rather unpleasant combination that I could taste with every inhale.  With an unpredictable jerk, like a marionette with one too many strings pulled all at once, he tossed a set of keys in my direction and muttered, “Don’t pay no mind to the utility closet,” then turned without another word to re-enter his cave.  

I caught a glimpse of the inside of his office in the seconds it took him to slam the door in my face and noticed a worn armchair with threadbare upholstery sagging beneath the heavy weight of inertia, like nothing has changed here in decades.  A small tube TV played a staticy soap opera with the volume turned low and on the wall above it hung a corkboard cluttered with yellowed notes and lost keys with labeled tags.  And the impressions I was granted in those few moments were the only insights I was given into what my new home would be like.  So, I took this interaction with a grain of salt and trudged up the maintenance stairs that led me to the doorway of apartment 6B.

Upon entering, I noticed the place was bare, but livable.  I wasn’t necessarily in the market for luxury, so this would do just fine.  It was pared down to just the essentials – a bathroom that was barely big enough to allow me to brush my teeth, pee, and shower in separate motions, a kitchenette, with old but still functional appliances and a dented refrigerator that hummed a little too loudly, and small living space that would act as my “bedroom”. The walls were plain and a not-quite-dirty off-white, marked in places with scuffs leftover from tenants past. A single overhead bulb cast a soft, yellow light that left the corners of the room dim and frankly, a little lonesome.  But it was enough for me to haul in a futon, a crate that doubled as a coffee table, and a small secondhand bookshelf that honestly held more empty space than books, but helped me to feel less alone.

It wasn’t until after I got my meager belongings situated and adjusted the crooked window blinds just enough to let in splintered strips of muted afternoon sun that I noticed the utility closet.  It was little more than a dented slab of metal, once painted gray but now mottled with not so few splotchy stains of long-neglected water damage.  At its edges, flakes of paint curled away from the seams as if they were afraid of what lay on the other side.  And through its handle, a heavy-duty padlock smudged with faint, oily fingerprints held it bolted shut.

“This must be what the landlord was talking about,” I said aloud to myself, stepping towards the door to inspect it.  As I approached, I felt a faint draft leak from the crack beneath it, carrying with it the smell of something cool and sour.  I pressed my ear to its surface, the metal an unwelcoming feeling against my cheek.  I held my breath expecting the sounds from my worst nightmares to greet my ears, but instead, nothing.  There was only a slight hiss that was probably nothing more than the air blowing in through the vents.  

“He told me not to pay any mind to it, so I’m not going to.  It’s locked up because it’s a maintenance-only thing I bet.  There’s probably duct entrances and water heater access back there that I don’t need to bother with.”  At least, that’s what I thought until the note arrived.

I had barely been settled into the place for a week when I got it.  It was slipped under my door covertly, with no sign as to who had been its deliverer.  Scrawled in a messy hand on a torn up piece of notebook paper, the message read:

He gets thirsty.  

Once at dawn.  Once at dusk.  

Blue cup only.  

No glass, no metal.  

Don’t speak.  Don’t listen.  Don’t touch.

And sitting, situated just so, on top of my bookshelf was a blue plastic cup.  It looked like the kind you’d find in an old diner or forgotten in the back of a kitchen cabinet, the kind of cup that never seems to disappear, no matter how often you move – lightweight and a little scuffed, its once vivid color dulled by years of use and dishwasher cycles, slightly translucent with a seam running down one side from the molding process – nothing special.  It had a few tiny nicks along its otherwise smooth rim.  Picking it up made me feel oddly nostalgic, like it belonged in a childhood memory.  It was sturdy and unremarkable and utterly terrifying.

How had this gotten into my place?  I understood how a note could be slipped under the door by any passersby, but how could they have gotten *in* here?  

I checked the lock and deadbolt on my front door, and sure enough, all was secure.  And it was after that initial moment of panic that the words on the note settled into my brain.

*He gets thirsty*.

I looked to the water-stained utility closet door and let the thought register that the sound I had tried to convince myself was just air moving through the vents did sound a lot like breathing.  I don’t know if it was stupidity, curiosity, or unearned hubris, but something had me picking that lock.

The padlock thudded on the worn carpet and I slowly cracked the door open.  At first, it looked like nothing more than empty space.  What had I been so afraid of?  Clearly the note was some sort of prank.  Then I noticed the jagged hole punched into the drywall.  A thin layer of drywall dust speckled the floor and creeping patches of black mold spread in irregular, fuzzy blotches  from the open puncture wound in the wall.  I could tell it had started to thrive, blooming silently where water had steeped itself into the porous surface.  This must be where that sour smell had been coming from.  I could feel its stench of decay settling in the back of my throat as I inched closer to the opening.

It led to a hollow crawlspace existing in the space between units, and there, kneeling in the darkness, was a man.  He didn’t react to anything, not the creak of the door nor the slice of light spilling into his dark hollow.  He was resting, perfectly still, with his knees bent at unnatural angles and his spine arched like a question mark.  His skin was stretched thin over his pointed shoulder blades jutting from his back like wings that never grew.  There was something almost fetal in his posture, vulnerable and expectant, but there was still a tight tension being held in his limbs, like a spring wound too tight waiting to release.  

The more I stared, the more I noticed about this thing hunched on the floor.  He looked unfinished, like he had been sculpted from wax and left too close to a fire.  Those thin, long limbs looked like they had been built for crawling, not walking, and every joint seemed hyperextended, like he had been folded up in this tight, dark place for years.  He was hairless – no eyebrows or lashes, even – and his skin glistened, damp with sweat.

I stared in awe-struck horror, unable to move at first.  How long has this man been hiding in the walls?  Is he the one who left the cup, the note?  But how?  The door was padlocked from the outside and there was no other way out of that crawlspace.  Did the landlord know?  Is that why he told me not to mind the closet?  Is that why it’s locked up?

I slowly backed out of the closet, not taking my eyes off of the man-thing, but he never once moved.  He didn’t even look at me.  Should I just…lock the door back up and pretend this was all a horrible nightmare?  I mean, I didn’t have anywhere else to go, and I couldn’t afford to leave to find somewhere new even if I wanted to.  And then my mind returned to the note’s message.

*He gets thirsty*.  *Once at dawn.  Once at dusk.  Blue cup only.*

Dusk was approaching, so I figured it wouldn’t hurt to indulge my curiosity just once.  Then I could figure out what to do.  So, I went to the sink and filled the blue cup up with water and waited.

When dusk arrived, I walked back into the closet and set the cup on the floor, not lingering any longer than I had to.  In seconds, the man’s gaunt, unnatural arm reached through the hole and snatched at the cup.  Every tendon and vein created a map of something once human now turned wrong as his fingers – long, knobby things with nails like cracked glass – moved independently, twitching and feeling for something that he could sense, but not see.  

He drank from the cup greedily, slurping and lapping at the water.  His throat worked in frantic, gulping spasms making each swallow loud and wet, broken only by the sharp, sucking breaths he was taking in through his nose.  The sound was desperate and obscene.

It wasn’t until he had licked up the last drops from the bottom of the cup that he finally turned to look at me.  He moved slowly, like bone grinding on bone, and he blinked once, twice, deliberately and carefully, like he was trying to remember how.  His chest was moving with shallow, erratic breaths and I could smell something meat-sweet and wrong roiling off of him.  He lifted the corners of his small, tight-lipped mouth into some semblance of what I think was meant to be a smile.  The skin of his lips was raw and gnawed, as if he had been chewing on them.  And with a slight, jerky nod of his pale, bald head, he retreated into the dark.

I know technically, I could have left.  Most people in their right minds would have left the second they saw the padlocked door.  But I was broke and stupid and I can’t justify why I continued to provide the man in the wall with water, but it became our own little ritual.  It was like he had become a proxy for everything I had failed at previously.  At least he was predictable.  At least I mattered.  He depended on me twice a day, every day.  And so it continued.

The same note was slipped under my door each day, as if to remind me of the rules.  I filled the blue cup, once at dawn and once at dusk, and he drank.  He never said a word, never moved towards me; we just continued our strange partnership.  Until the morning I slept through dawn.

That was the morning I woke up to a soaked carpet with the blue cup nowhere in sight.  I plodded through my living space, each heavy footstep squelching underneath me with a heavy, reluctant give.  The soggy fibers that had worked their way loose in the treadpath that had been worn from the sink to the closet clung to my shoes like something half-alive.  The damp had seeped deep into the thin padding beneath, spreading outward in dark, irregular stains that spidered across the floor in an unwelcoming web.  

When I reached the closet, sitting in the center of the floor was a red cup.  The red was deep, but uneven.  It had faded in patches where fingers once gripped it, where lips once pressed.  It was made of porcelain that was likely once smooth and glossy, but whose blood-colored glaze was now marred by tiny cracks breaking the surface like frost, with a single chip at the rim, sharp and white, exposing the fragile bone beneath.  And when I picked it up, it was cold to the touch and heavier than it looked, solid in a way that felt deliberate, as though whatever it was meant to hold mattered.

I hurriedly filled it to the brim and shoved it through the hole in the wall and watched as the man’s bowed forearm, which curved ever so slightly in a way it shouldn’t, as if it had been broken before and healed without care, extended to meet me.  I placed the red cup on his outstretched palm and watched him drink, but this time, when he was done, he spoke.

His voice was thin and brittle and carried a dry rasp with it, his throat raw from disuse.  There was a tremble to it – not quite fear, not quite madness, but something jagged and hungry in between.  In a whisper that barely rose above a breath, but which still crawled into my ears, wet and intimate, all the same, he crooned “*Mooooore*”.

I wanted to continue fulfilling my side of our partnership, so I brought him more, cup after cup.  He lapped each one up, working with the same desperation as a thirsty dog dragging its too-swollen tongue over the dregs of an almost-empty bowl, head low, mouth open, greed swallowing grace.  After each cup reached its very last drops, there was not the usual satisfaction, but instead just panting, trembling, and the dawning dread of needing it again.  

When I finally stopped bringing him the water after wearing myself out running back and forth to the kitchen for refills is when the whispering began.  At first, it was just the slightest sound, soft and broken.  His lips barely moved and unintelligible words slipped out in fragments, syllables chewed thin and ragged, strung together in a desperate attempt to escape a mouth lined with dust.  Then the words spilled faster, gaining shape and urgency and rhythm.  

“…it started with thirst…throat like sand…tongue like ash…not even blood left to swallow…”

He leaned closer to the wall, as if confessing to it, but his whispers grew faster and carried, curling through the air like smoke.

“…drank from pipes, from puddles, from rot… from things that should not hold water…”

A shudder ran through him.  His fingers twitched.

“…but it’s never enough. never enough. never ever enough…”

He pressed his face closer to the wall, cracked lips nearly touching it as if he was trying to press his words into the plaster.

“…it drinks through us now. through skin. through sleep. it waits in the wet. it waits in the walls…”

With that, his voice broke into a croak, barely audible now.

“…so thirsty… and we let it in…”

And then he stopped.  His wide, sunken eyes ringed with bruised purple flesh flickered in and out of focus.  All I could hear as he stared was the sound of his dry tongue clumsily scraping over his teeth like sandpaper dragged over wood and the drip-drop of water that I couldn’t find the source of.

I had to get out of there.  I stumbled out of my apartment and ran down the hallway to the maintenance stairs.  I sprinted down them, not knowing if I should find the landlord or, I dunno, call the police or something.  But as I burst forth from what I thought was the exit into the lobby, I found myself standing in the same hallway that housed my apartment.  I tried going down the stairs again and again, but each time I ended up face to face with the bronzed 6B nailed crooked and slightly off-center on my door.  I paced up and down the hallway, knocking on every door I passed.  When no one answered, I started trying doorknobs, hoping I could find any reprieve from the endless loop I had found myself in – and maybe find somewhere where I’d stop hearing that goddamn dripping.  Was it getting louder?

Every apartment door I tried opened and every single one was empty, completely devoid of life.  They all bore the same layout as my own, identical padlocked closet doors and all, and each one was equipped with its very own red cup placed gently, tenderly on the counter.

I’m back in 6B now and the drip has continued slow and methodical.  It’s almost calming, but it doesn’t stop.  It’s gotten louder, heavier.  Each drop lands with a wet slap that echoes far too much for the space I’m in.  The silence between them is shrinking.  I’ve started to anticipate the sound before it comes.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

He’s started asking for more again, timing his requests with the rhythmic, fleshy plops resonating through the room.  

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.  More.  More.  More.

I swear I can feel it behind my eyes.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

The padlock thudded on the worn carpet and I slowly cracked the door open.  At first, it looked like nothing more than empty space.  What had I been so afraid of?  Clearly the note was some sort of prank.  Then I noticed the jagged hole punched into the drywall.  A thin layer of drywall dust speckled the floor and creeping patches of black mold spread in irregular, fuzzy blotches  from the open puncture wound in the wall.  I could tell it had started to thrive, blooming silently where water had steeped itself into the porous surface.  This must be where that sour smell had been coming from.  I could feel its stench of decay settling in the back of my throat as I inched closer to the opening.

It led to a hollow crawlspace existing in the space between units, and there, kneeling in the darkness, was a man.  He didn’t react to anything, not the creak of the door nor the slice of light spilling into his dark hollow.  He was resting, perfectly still, with his knees bent at unnatural angles and his spine arched like a question mark.  His skin was stretched thin over his pointed shoulder blades jutting from his back like wings that never grew.  There was something almost fetal in his posture, vulnerable and expectant, but there was still a tight tension being held in his limbs, like a spring wound too tight waiting to release.  

The more I stared, the more I noticed about this thing hunched on the floor.  He looked unfinished, like he had been sculpted from wax and left too close to a fire.  Those thin, long limbs looked like they had been built for crawling, not walking, and every joint seemed hyperextended, like he had been folded up in this tight, dark place for years.  He was hairless – no eyebrows or lashes, even – and his skin glistened, damp with sweat.

I stared in awe-struck horror, unable to move at first.  How long has this man been hiding in the walls?  Is he the one who left the cup, the note?  But how?  The door was padlocked from the outside and there was no other way out of that crawlspace.  Did the landlord know?  Is that why he told me not to mind the closet?  Is that why it’s locked up?

I slowly backed out of the closet, not taking my eyes off of the man-thing, but he never once moved.  He didn’t even look at me.  Should I just…lock the door back up and pretend this was all a horrible nightmare?  I mean, I didn’t have anywhere else to go, and I couldn’t afford to leave to find somewhere new even if I wanted to.  And then my mind returned to the note’s message.

*He gets thirsty*.  *Once at dawn.  Once at dusk.  Blue cup only.*

Dusk was approaching, so I figured it wouldn’t hurt to indulge my curiosity just once.  Then I could figure out what to do.  So, I went to the sink and filled the blue cup up with water and waited.

When dusk arrived, I walked back into the closet and set the cup on the floor, not lingering any longer than I had to.  In seconds, the man’s gaunt, unnatural arm reached through the hole and snatched at the cup.  Every tendon and vein created a map of something once human now turned wrong as his fingers – long, knobby things with nails like cracked glass – moved independently, twitching and feeling for something that he could sense, but not see.  

He drank from the cup greedily, slurping and lapping at the water.  His throat worked in frantic, gulping spasms making each swallow loud and wet, broken only by the sharp, sucking breaths he was taking in through his nose.  The sound was desperate and obscene.

It wasn’t until he had licked up the last drops from the bottom of the cup that he finally turned to look at me.  He moved slowly, like bone grinding on bone, and he blinked once, twice, deliberately and carefully, like he was trying to remember how.  His chest was moving with shallow, erratic breaths and I could smell something meat-sweet and wrong roiling off of him.  He lifted the corners of his small, tight-lipped mouth into some semblance of what I think was meant to be a smile.  The skin of his lips was raw and gnawed, as if he had been chewing on them.  And with a slight, jerky nod of his pale, bald head, he retreated into the dark.

I know technically, I could have left.  Most people in their right minds would have left the second they saw the padlocked door.  But I was broke and stupid and I can’t justify why I continued to provide the man in the wall with water, but it became our own little ritual.  It was like he had become a proxy for everything I had failed at previously.  At least he was predictable.  At least I mattered.  He depended on me twice a day, every day.  And so it continued.

The same note was slipped under my door each day, as if to remind me of the rules.  I filled the blue cup, once at dawn and once at dusk, and he drank.  He never said a word, never moved towards me; we just continued our strange partnership.  Until the morning I slept through dawn.

That was the morning I woke up to a soaked carpet with the blue cup nowhere in sight.  I plodded through my living space, each heavy footstep squelching underneath me with a heavy, reluctant give.  The soggy fibers that had worked their way loose in the treadpath that had been worn from the sink to the closet clung to my shoes like something half-alive.  The damp had seeped deep into the thin padding beneath, spreading outward in dark, irregular stains that spidered across the floor in an unwelcoming web.  

When I reached the closet, sitting in the center of the floor was a red cup.  The red was deep, but uneven.  It had faded in patches where fingers once gripped it, where lips once pressed.  It was made of porcelain that was likely once smooth and glossy, but whose blood-colored glaze was now marred by tiny cracks breaking the surface like frost, with a single chip at the rim, sharp and white, exposing the fragile bone beneath.  And when I picked it up, it was cold to the touch and heavier than it looked, solid in a way that felt deliberate, as though whatever it was meant to hold mattered.

I hurriedly filled it to the brim and shoved it through the hole in the wall and watched as the man’s bowed forearm, which curved ever so slightly in a way it shouldn’t, as if it had been broken before and healed without care, extended to meet me.  I placed the red cup on his outstretched palm and watched him drink, but this time, when he was done, he spoke.

His voice was thin and brittle and carried a dry rasp with it, his throat raw from disuse.  There was a tremble to it – not quite fear, not quite madness, but something jagged and hungry in between.  In a whisper that barely rose above a breath, but which still crawled into my ears, wet and intimate, all the same, he crooned “*Mooooore*”.

I wanted to continue fulfilling my side of our partnership, so I brought him more, cup after cup.  He lapped each one up, working with the same desperation as a thirsty dog dragging its too-swollen tongue over the dregs of an almost-empty bowl, head low, mouth open, greed swallowing grace.  After each cup reached its very last drops, there was not the usual satisfaction, but instead just panting, trembling, and the dawning dread of needing it again.  

When I finally stopped bringing him the water after wearing myself out running back and forth to the kitchen for refills is when the whispering began.  At first, it was just the slightest sound, soft and broken.  His lips barely moved and unintelligible words slipped out in fragments, syllables chewed thin and ragged, strung together in a desperate attempt to escape a mouth lined with dust.  Then the words spilled faster, gaining shape and urgency and rhythm.  

“…it started with thirst…throat like sand…tongue like ash…not even blood left to swallow…”

He leaned closer to the wall, as if confessing to it, but his whispers grew faster and carried, curling through the air like smoke.

“…drank from pipes, from puddles, from rot… from things that should not hold water…”

A shudder ran through him.  His fingers twitched.

“…but it’s never enough. never enough. never ever enough…”

He pressed his face closer to the wall, cracked lips nearly touching it as if he was trying to press his words into the plaster.

“…it drinks through us now. through skin. through sleep. it waits in the wet. it waits in the walls…”

With that, his voice broke into a croak, barely audible now.

“…so thirsty… and we let it in…”

And then he stopped.  His wide, sunken eyes ringed with bruised purple flesh flickered in and out of focus.  All I could hear as he stared was the sound of his dry tongue clumsily scraping over his teeth like sandpaper dragged over wood and the drip-drop of water that I couldn’t find the source of.

I had to get out of there.  I stumbled out of my apartment and ran down the hallway to the maintenance stairs.  I sprinted down them, not knowing if I should find the landlord or, I dunno, call the police or something.  But as I burst forth from what I thought was the exit into the lobby, I found myself standing in the same hallway that housed my apartment.  I tried going down the stairs again and again, but each time I ended up face to face with the bronzed 6B nailed crooked and slightly off-center on my door.  I paced up and down the hallway, knocking on every door I passed.  When no one answered, I started trying doorknobs, hoping I could find any reprieve from the endless loop I had found myself in – and maybe find somewhere where I’d stop hearing that goddamn dripping.  Was it getting louder?

Every apartment door I tried opened and every single one was empty, completely devoid of life.  They all bore the same layout as my own, identical padlocked closet doors and all, and each one was equipped with its very own red cup placed gently, tenderly on the counter.

I’m back in 6B now and the drip has continued slow and methodical.  It’s almost calming, but it doesn’t stop.  It’s gotten louder, heavier.  Each drop lands with a wet slap that echoes far too much for the space I’m in.  The silence between them is shrinking.  I’ve started to anticipate the sound before it comes.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

He’s started asking for more again, timing his requests with the rhythmic, fleshy plops resonating through the room.  

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.  More.  More.  More.

I swear I can feel it behind my eyes.

Drip.  Drip.  Drip.

My main goal was to build a routine that felt doable long term.

This sub has been super helpful and encouraging to see positive results and feedback, so I figured it was time for my first post. Just wanted to say it is possible!

Here’s what worked for me:
	1.	I never fully cut carbs, just chose a few healthier faves for me to start the meal with that I didn’t have to overthink. Some staples for me:
	•	Edamame
	•	Steamed broccoli
	•	Cucumber + avocado salad
Then I’d have my regular meal (like white rice/ recently swapped with quinoa once in a while in smaller portions) with protein — lentils, chicken, fish, Greek yogurt.
	3.	Nuts and seeds were easy to add and kept me full between meals.
	4.	I ate all 3 meals between 9 AM and 7 PM with an evening snack some days
	5.	I have a huge sweet tooth, so I didn’t give up sugar.
	•	I had an average of 2 fancy desserts per week (husband bakes)
	•	And something small and sweet after lunch every day - like sesame balls, a tiny peanut bar, or some dark chocolate.
	6.	Still had my daily coffee with 1 tsp sugar
	7.	I made sure to walk at least 10 minutes after lunch and dinner. If that wasn’t possible, I did calf raises instead
	8.	Started working out 4–5 times a week, mixing strength and cardio

I’m sharing the sugar part in detail because I wondered at times if I needed to cut it completely. But honestly, that just wouldn’t have worked for me in the long run and i would have felt like i am giving up something which i love

Surely there are other towns out there and I would like to know about them!

So if you are also a parent and live in a town that you really love, could you tell us where and what you love about it?

- Do you love your local coffee shop?
- Do you have tons of great parent friends?

I deducted it was a combination of bad diet (pain au chocolates hot chocolates smoking weed and dabbling in cocaine and vaping plus new job and lack of sleep).  Then it became once every quarter then three times a year then twice usually when seasoned changed.  I might have had only one outbreak last year. Likely two though. 
I just had my first for this year and it’s In a new spot on my lip.  
I have been in a lot of physical and mental pain with a lot of unexpected change and dealing with grief.   
I have a feeling it’s from my new daily coffee with cream and sugar for the last week and four timbits with it that is the trigger.  I’m surprised because earlier this year I was making cocoa with almond milk everyday and drinking chocolate almond milk and had no reaction even though it contains chocolate and nuts which should be a trigger. I was also eating avocado everyday and cashews.   

Lately I’ve been eating a lot of cherries and plantains , mostly whole foods aside from the daily coffee and I guess cake (that’s what timbits are for any non Canadians. They’re donut holes ).  I also ate strawberry rhubarb crisp all last week (homemade).  I’m wondering how far back I should go to try to determine my trigger or is it seeming like it’s just lack of structured sleep and diet? Should I be concerned it was triggered by my lip chap? I think one of them had a mint additive? Or maybe my mouthwash? I also used hydrogen peroxide on my toothbrush last week about five days ago.    I did a lot of deep stretching yesterday and then couldn’t sleep from being so sore.  I think I was up until 5 am tossing and turning my arms and shoulders hurt so much.   Then I woke up at 11 and noticed I was mouth breathing and had a cold sore in the middle of my lip. I normally get to the bottom right of it.   Thankfully it looks less noticeable this way but I’m wondering if certain parts of the lip are correlated with certain nerve branches in my spine/back/neck that maybe got triggered/released while I was deep stretching and massaging myself ? 
I’ve been using a tens machine the last year and didn’t find it triggered anything even when used on my neck and upper back.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Twins vs. Dodgers: A Parlay of Peril and Porous Pitching**  
The Minnesota Twins and Los Angeles Dodgers are set for a clash that’s less “World Series preview” and more “Why is this happening?” The Dodgers, baseball’s version of a Netflix true-crime docuseries (everyone’s guilty, no one’s surprised), are favored at -198, implying a 66.67% chance to win. The Twins, meanwhile, are +180 underdogs, which the SportsLine model thinks is a steal—projecting them to win 38% of simulations. Let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a middle schooler’s baseball puns.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Batting Averages

The Twins’ 37-15 record when they get eight or more hits is the statistical equivalent of a “get out of jail free” card. They’re like a toaster that suddenly learns to bake croissants—inefficient, surprising, and occasionally life-changing. Meanwhile, the Dodgers are 34-21 at home, which is less “dominance” and more “they refuse to lose in their own living room.”

Pitching? Chris Paddack for the Twins is the human equivalent of a “meh” emoji—respectable but forgettable. Tyler Glasnow for the Dodgers, though, is a volcanic eruption in cleats. Last season, Glasnow struck out 13 batters in a start against the Twins, which is like a librarian yelling at a library. The Twins’ offense, however, has a 37-15 record when they get eight hits, which is statistically significant and also the equivalent of a vampire needing eight cups of coffee to survive the day.

### News Digest: Injuries, or Why This Game Might Be a Boring Nap

The provided data is as exciting as a tax audit, but let’s extrapolate! The Twins’ recent Legion baseball game in Twin Falls (where Justin Martin and Brodee Thomson presumably flexed their pre-Major League muscles) is a red herring, like finding a sock in a cereal box. No injuries are mentioned for either team, which is suspicious. Are th

1m7q8x2,https://i.redd.it/pgsuwar7xpef1.jpeg,Anytime soon (a.k.a. Maybe Never),"I run a 4+ years long research in something called Pseudo-Sensory Feedback for HCI, which I have specialised myself in.  

I have only really paid attention to this today. Brands do this an awful lot, in fact, in way more insidious ways. Even though customers have long asked for this feature in particular, it is interesting to see how Culture Code also builds on one narrative but mock-aligns with another. 

For example, image and attachments on Things as a feature. Culture Code knows how much users have asked for and complained about this. 

Nevertheless, it is amusing to see that they are intentional about mixing their own App Store screenshots with a very specific image of Apple Notes. 

Note that Apple Notes is shown BEHIND their own experience, discreetly signalling that they do something that doesn’t really exist in their feature set. 

Since Things couldn’t be any simpler and relies, exclusively, on IxD and experience workflow, this creates a number of effects: 

- It puts the customer on a perpetual state of unknown “hold” - *Will they do it? They have ‘shown’ it in their intentions!*;

- It compels the users to keep tracking changes, for however long it takes, hoping that this will be added to their own experience;

- It feature-jacks a functionality that is not fundamentally theirs “stage manager, multiple windows” and presents it as their own;

- It ensures that perception is colour-controlled (Things is coloured, Apple Notes is “invisible” in black and white), except for the “premium”, “quiz” and “liberal” tossed amidst an unintelligible (to most) ramble of Latin bodycopy. 

- It creates an illusion of being “native Apple” while still storytelling itself as separate.

1m7q82a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m7q82a/aita_for_a_coffee_shop_zoom_meeting/,AITA for a coffee shop zoom meeting?,"hi all! an experience at a cafe left me a little uncomfortable today. so for context i like to work the mornings from this cafe once a week, and usually stop in once or twice for coffee to go! i’m usually there from 8:30-12:30 roughly, order 2 drinks and a pastry during my time there. i feel like i have a pretty good relationship with the employees at this point. 

today, i sat in my normal corner, out of the way and did my normal work. i got pulled into a zoom meeting out of the blue, but knew i wasn’t going to need to be an active participant, and more just listening to the meeting while doing other work. i started the meeting and said hi to my co workers. there was one woman sitting next to me (working as well on her laptop). 

i see her texting on her laptop and im sorry but naturally i look over. i see her text her husband “the woman next to me just started a 4 person zoom meeting and its so busy in here”. i would say the coffee shop was busy, but we live in a tourist town and there wasnt anyone looking for a seat or asking for their coffee for here. if i had to be on this call chatting for an hour and a half, i would have taken it elsewhere and relocated. i also was planning to be here throughout the time the meeting was going to span anyways. 

i go about the meeting and maybe speak for cumulatively 3 minutes from 10:30-12. i’ve been working in the background of this meeting too answering emails and doing other things etc. around 11:45 the woman next to me sets her phone down face up. she’s texted her husband again “and she’s still on the meeting!!!” at this point i think it’s kind of rude. but maybe it’s my fault for glancing down, but the phone was 5 inches from my hand! 

also, it was about time for my second drink but since my camera was on, i couldn’t get up to order a coffee so i online ordered and asked the wonderful staff to hand it to me since i was in the meeting and in reach of the espresso bar. i order my drinks and the employees loved the note and were laughing and giving me thumbs up. again, im here fairly often!! i get my drink and also tipped $5 on an $8 drink. 

i hang up my meeting and finish up a bit of work around 12. the woman next to me meets up with her husband for lunch at the cafe. she then loudly announces “well i guess ill go home with you! i don’t want to squat all day and take up a table!” and at this point my mouth is open. i would totally understand if i was talking the whole time, that would have been rude!! and i guess i would have understood the first message if she thought it would be noisy and talking the whole time. 

she leaves and i ask for a to go up for my drink. i thank them again for bringing me my drink and said i was sorry to have taken a zoom meeting in the cafe and i try not to take meetings in public. they told me it was totally fine and they loved the note and were hanging it up in the back. i thank them again and tell them i’ll see them soon. 

i guess where im coming from is that i wasn’t actively talking and no one else was visible in my camera.

idk. am i the asshole for taking a zoom meeting at this cafe?? my house has construction being done and i wanted to escape the hammering and noise for the morning.

I'm inviting y'all this year to my DJ set on Twitch where I exclusively play artists who are performing at this year's OSL..  It all goes down at [twitch.tv/djundeadsinatra](http://twitch.tv/djundeadsinatra) on Friday, July 25 kicking of at 7 PM PST and then usually wrapping up at like 9:30 PM.

**FAQ:**  
  
Q.  **Isn't this kinda far in advance for a pre-party?**  
A.  **Why yes, yes it is.**  If I had by druthers, I'd do it the weekend before OSL.  But, alas, I'm busy this upcoming Saturday and then Sunday I'm headed out of town for a week so this is my only change to do a set before OSL.

Q. **Do I need a Twitch account to tune-in?**  
A. **Nope, not at all!**  Stop by, listen to some good tunes, an watch me dance around in my basement while panicking about the next couple songs.  Good times.  A Twitch account is only needed if you want to use the chat to gas me up, fret about scheduling conflicts, and/or talk to my wife and a handful of our friends abut how cool I am really so cool 100% no cap.

Q. **Are you a good DJ?**  
A. **I'm legit a-not-good-DJ-as-real-DJs-go** ***BUT*** **I am an excellent selekta.** You wanna hear a good mix of tunes slapped together live by an dude in his 50s using actual CDs on top-of-the-market-circa-Y2K-CDJ-1000s-and-streaming-that-which-he-doesn't-own?  Then you will be in the right place.

Q. **Is this your first rodeo?**  
A, **No, No it is not.** I DJ'd parties all through college in the late 80s-mid-90s. I've done many a friend's wedding and birthday party. During the pandemic I started DJ-ing on Twitch Fri 7-9 PM, Sat 2-4 PM and Sun 4-6 PM. I've kept it up for 5 years and change now.  Trust Me, I'm A DJ.

Q. **That's A Pretty Good Stretch For A Twitch DJ, Will There Be Inside Jokes I Have No Hope Of Getting?**  
A. **Absolutely.**  The big one is a two parter: The World Famous ""Best of Carson "" Joke. 

* At the 45 minute mark or so, I read off a way too long list of countries and states where I have listeners, all fans of the 'The World Famous ""Best of Carson "" Joke. 
* At the 1:50 mark or so, I affect the persona of a baseball announcer in the 70s or 80s warning the local affiliates that we are headed into the extra innings and then telling viewers about the extra innings sponsor and what guest will be appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson- a very special Best of Carson episode since we're running so long.

It's hysterical.  Especially since I've been doing it for like 5 years now. DEDICATION TO THE BIT.

We had a discussion about the situation and he spent hours trying to convince me that it was my own insecurities that were causing me to feel upset, not his actions.  

I told him that I will be leaving the marriage, at which point he then become very cruel and started saying terrible things to me. I became physically upset and started hyperventilating. I have had maybe one or two bouts of hyperventilation in my past 42 years of life and from what I remember was able to calm myself down after a minute or two, but this was something different, I wasn’t able to take any deep breaths, all of my breaths were shallow, and I couldn’t take any air past a very shallow breath and without creating some sort of grunt. 

I also have stress induced asthma and have had it since I was 12.  I believe the hyperventilating converted into a stress induced asthma attack, I grabbed my inhaler that was in my desk drawer, and took two puffs, but there was no relief. 

At this point, he was downstairs and I started to get very dizzy, the room was spinning, and my fingertips started to tingle. I crawled out to the top of the stairs and was grunting and gasping for air, I did my best to yell his name. He walked halfway up the stairs and through small grants I asked him to call 911, he stood there and just blankly looked at me with his phone in his hand. I repeated it again and told him I’m begging you please call 911 I’m going to die. He continued to just stand and stare at me blankly, he then put his phone in his mouth and bit down so hard on his phone that it cracked.  

At this point, I realized that I was probably going to die so I ran down the stairs, was able to find my purse and made it to my car. I started driving towards an emergency room. At this point, the hyperventilating and inability to take a full breath had been lasting for about 8 to 10 minutes. As I was driving i once again had the feeling of “fading out” so I pulled over into a neighborhood and called an ambulance, they arrived and I was not able to breathe normally until I was in the ambulance for like another 10 minutes.  

I was given a nebulizer at the hospital, which gave me the ability to finally take a deep breath.  

While, at the hospital, I was in shock at what had just happened and also confused. I consulted a close friend on the situation and she of course, found it horrific, and validated my feelings. I was at the emergency department for about eight hours, arrived home at 7 AM and then at 10 AM he started making so much noise in the kitchen that it woke me up. I went downstairs, I made myself a cup of coffee and sat at the kitchen table, he acted like nothing had happened and was going about his day as normal. 

He never once apologized or asked me how I was feeling. 

I very calmly asked him why he refused to call an ambulance for me and he said that he was panicked and didn’t know what to do. I understand being panicked, but aren’t people who are like actively being stabbed able to call 911? Also, I’m very confused by the action of him biting his phone. I theorized that he did this so he could break his phone and not be able to call 911 but he said that this was an absurd accusation, I have since left the house for my safety and not discussed any of this with any of my family members. 

I was under the assumption that when you marry someone one of their most important tasks is to protect you and keep you safe. 

His stance is that this situation is something that we can work through and get over, but my stance is that I need a divorce and a protection order. Can anyone share some insight on what is going on, I do not have any friends where I live that I can talk to. 

Also additional information, calling an ambulance and going to the emergency room would not put us in any sort of financial distress, we both have very comprehensive/good insurance.

Como fan del bubble tea, me he dado a la tarea de probar varios spots en El Salvador que ofrecen esta bebida deliciosa con tapioca. Aquí te dejo mi ranking personal, basado en sabor, calidad, precio, atención y experiencia general. Si estás buscando dónde darte un gusto refrescante y diferente, esta lista es para vos.

**Bobaluba**

#  El mejor en sabor, consistencia, precio y presentación.

Bobaluba se lleva el primer lugar sin discusión. El Strawberries & Cream y está en otro nivel. Ya lo probé en varias sucursales y el sabor fue igual de rico. Eso ya es decir mucho, porque mantener la calidad así en varios lugares no siempre pasa.

La bebida es súper cremosa, con un sabor a fresa que no se siente artificial, y la tapioca estaba PERFECTA. Nada chiclosa, nada dura, ¡justo en su punto!, creo que esto se debe a que me dijeron que Bobaluba hace su tapioca todos los días Además, traía bastante cantidad, o sea que sí te llena y vale lo que cuesta.

Por otro lado, Bobaluba es el que tiene muchas mas ubicaciones a nivel nacional y su menú es el mas completo que hay actualmente, destacando por la variedad de extras y opciones de mochis.

🧋 Recomendado: Strawberries & Cream, Belgian Chocolate, Coffee Toffe y Slushie de fresa con tapioca o bebidas especiales de temporada.

⭐ Calificación: 9.8/10

**I Shi Cha**

#  Interesante fusión con opciones asiáticas

Aunque es más conocido por sus shishas, I Shi Sha también tiene una sección de bebidas con bubble tea. Sus sabores son diferentes, y algunos incluso fusionan elementos árabes y asiáticos. Ideal si buscás algo alternativo y con vibra distinta. Sin embargo me pareció mucho hielo.y el sabor de la tapioca es raro, muy chicloso. 

🧋 Recomendado: Dong Gua Milk Tea (verde y blanco)

⭐ Calificación: 8/10

https://preview.redd.it/oefdsltf5pef1.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6faade0c1ec13ef86184e0b07ac3d5e72e2c9e32

**OCHA Boba**

# Opciones frescas, frutales y con variedad de postres

Una propuesta moderna, fresca y enfocada en sabores naturales. OCHA Boba tiene un menú bastante variado, con opciones menos azucaradas y una presentación cuidada. El local es muy instagrameable y cómodo para quedarse un rato, pero si el precio está bastante elevado para el rubro. 

🧋 Recomendado: Classic Milk Tea, Fit -chita y Caramel Latte

⭐ Calificación: 8.5/10

https://preview.redd.it/lyf6ktng5pef1.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9b0f31b5dba590094e48e266f647aa08bc757ef

**Thai Bubble**

# Clásico, tranquilo y balanceado

Thai Bubble ofrece un ambiente relajado, ideal para una pausa o para trabajar mientras disfrutás tu bebida. Su menú es más reducido, pero bien ejecutado. Las tapiocas suelen estar bien cocidas y los sabores son bastante buenos y su precio esta muy bien.

🧋 Recomendado: Thai Green Tea, Taro Milk Tea Chocolate La Milk Tea

⭐ Calificación: 8.5/10

https://preview.redd.it/q0r5jv1i5pef1.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c268fe0a22a3c52bed33a130356fb76aec35d42a

**Black Tiger Boba**

# Ideal para quienes quieren probar sabores únicos

Con un menú divertido Black Tiger ofrece combinaciones  con cheese foam, read bull con cream y algunos refreshers.  Es ideal para quienes se animan a salir de lo tradicional, sin embargo tienen pocas opciones de bases y combinaciones respecto a la competencia.

🧋 Recomendado: Black Tiger Milk y Matcha Tiger Milk

⭐ Calificación: 8/10

Or accidentally shorted a battery and watched your project fizzle (but secretly thought, “Whoa, that’s cool”)? Welcome to r/ElectroEnth, where the real fun isn’t in flawless builds—it’s in the zaps, the tweaks, and the thrill of making something work (eventually).This isn’t a club for engineers with perfect circuit diagrams (though if you’ve got a trick for keeping wires from tangling? Spill it). It’s for the person who burned out a capacitor and then repurposed it as a “vintage aesthetic component.” The hobbyist who spent three nights debugging a code only to find a missing comma. The curious soul who took apart an old radio “just to see how it ticks” and ended up with a box of screws and a vague idea of reassembly.Share your wins (and fails): “Finally got my Arduino to blink in Morse code! Burned two LEDs in the process, but my dog perked up at the pattern—success!” Ask for help with the head-scratchers: “Why does my breadboard keep losing connection? I checked the jumper wires! Is it haunted by a ghost resistor?” Celebrate the small triumphs: “Soldered my first joint without it looking like a blob! Cue the happy dance (and maybe a few singed fingertips).”We get it. Electronics is equal parts frustration and fascination. Like when you spent weeks designing a project, only to have it work for 10 seconds before frying. Or when you tried to build a robot and it kept driving in circles (but you called it “abstract art in motion”). But those are the moments that make your workbench yours—scattered resistors, half-finished projects, and all.Grab your multimeter (and maybe a spare fuse, just in case). Let’s swap stories about the time you mistook a 1k resistor for a 10k or forgot to ground a circuit. Here, the more relatable the mishap, the more we cheer. Because in the end, it’s not about the perfect build—it’s about the curiosity (and the coffee-fueled late nights) that go into making it.",1,1753316258.0,ElectroEnth,0,1.0,False

Talked to 15 people, zero actual friendships. Everyone's performing their ""successful woman"" persona so hard that any real conversation gets shut down. Try to go deeper than work talk and people look at you like you're being unprofessional.

I just want to find women who can talk about life instead of IG+linkedin updates. Women who can be messy and real instead of constantly networking without follow up.

You know that a reliable coffee scale is the difference between delicious consistency and frustrating guesswork. But finding a scale that's accurate, compact enough for an espresso drip tray, and doesn't break the bank can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. You're tired of scales with slow response times, annoying disposable batteries, or confusing features that hinder your workflow more than they help.\
\
The MHW-3BOMBER Mini Coffee Scale is an excellent choice for home baristas seeking high precision on a budget. While the quirky charging and smart modes require a learning curve, its accuracy, responsiveness, and compact size offer outstanding value for those looking to elevate their coffee game.\
\
This guide isn't just a list of specs. It's the result of weeks of hands-on testing where I put the MHW-3BOMBER Mini Coffee Scale with Timer, Rechargeable Espresso & Pour-Over Precision Scale through its paces. We'll dive deep into its real-world performance—the good, the bad, and the genuinely frustrating—by looking at its standout features, how it stacks up against giants like Timemore and Acaia, and ultimately, who should click ""buy"" and who should keep looking.\

MHW-3BOMBER Mini Coffee Scale with Timer, Rechargeable Espresso & Pour-Over Precision Scale Review : Our Honest Verdict\
\
The MHW-3BOMBER Mini Coffee Scale is an excellent choice for home baristas seeking high precision on a budget. While the quirky charging and smart modes require a learning curve, its accuracy, responsiveness, and compact size offer outstanding value.\
\
It's a compact powerhouse that delivers 0.1g accuracy, smart auto-timing features, and a rechargeable battery at a price point that makes precision coffee accessible to everyone. However, it's not without its flaws. The much-discussed charging issue and a slightly unintuitive interface are real drawbacks you need to be aware of before purchasing. This is our honest take after weeks of daily brewing.\
\
Pros\
  Cons\
\
High 0.1g precision for accurate brewing\
  Charging can be finicky (requires USB-A to C)\
\
Compact size fits most espresso machines\
  Smart auto-modes can be confusing at first\
\
Convenient rechargeable 700mAh battery\
  Some user reports of accuracy drift over time\
\
Responsive display and auto-on function\
  Does not fit under all machine setups (e.g., Flair Pro 2)\
\
Why Trust Our Review? Our Testing Process\
\
We tested the MHW-3BOMBER Mini Coffee Scale for 4 weeks, pulling over 50 espresso shots and making daily pour-overs. We measured battery life, responsiveness, and accuracy drift to provide a comprehensive, unbiased evaluation.\
\
To give you a review grounded in real-world experience, we didn't just read the manual. We integrated this scale into our daily coffee ritual for a full month. Here's exactly what our testing methodology involved:\

This is not directly related to our job as ALTs, but it's something that's really been affecting my self-confidence, especially when talking to teachers and students. I've been experiencing a breakout since the summer started, and I'm not sure if it's due to the weather or the skincare products that I've been using over the past 2 months. My eating and sleeping habits haven't really changed, and I've never had any skin issues like this before, so I don't think those are the cause. Sorry in advance—I'll be sharing a bit more detail about my skincare routine and diet.

For my SKINCARE, I use the following:

Wash: Merano CC Facial Wash  
Toner: La Roche-Posay Effaclar H Lotion  
Lotion: Hada Labo (transparent)  
Serum: Merano CC (gold)  
Moisturizer: Hada Labo lotion (white)  
Sunscreen: Tone Up UV Essence

\*\*I do this routine 2x a day--morning and evening after bathing

My DIET:

Breakfast - oatmeal with banana, or meat and veggies with rice plus black coffee  
Lunch - set meal at school--usually fried food with vegetable sides, rice, tea, and miso soup  
Snack - bread, sometimes chips  
Dinner - meat and veggies with rice plus fruit

\*\*Occasionally, I eat chocolate or ice cream

I sleep usually around 12AM.

I’ve been considering going to a dermatologist, but I understand that consultations and treatments for aesthetic concerns may not be covered by our health insurance.

Is it vegan to buy things made with slave labor?","Feel free to downvote if you think this is off topic. 


I strive to avoid the exploitation of all animals in my food and other purchases. This means I only eat plants and avoid animal testing, leather, etc. But humans are animals too. Is it practicable to minimize human exploitation in my life? Of course it's impossible to get rid of entirely, I am typing this on a smart phone after all. For example, a lot of vegetables (and of course factory farmed meat and dairy but that's already evil) basically use human slavery, even stuff grown in the USA, see the link. In my opinion, as an (albeit new) vegan, I should strive to avoid the slavery and abject cruelty volleyed at all animals, humans included. I am planning on transitioning to only fair trade and slavery free coffee and chocolate.  What labels should I look for? The link mentions ""fair food"" and ""food justice certified."" I don't really care about health, just reducing how I benefit from others exploitation.


On the other hand, under a capitalist system all labor is exploitative to some degree, but clearly some is more exploitative than others. I thought I'd ask this in a vegan sub because you all already care about reducing cruelty through consumption, so I don't really have to argue that that is a worthy goal.


This all started because a meat eater sort of called me hypocritical for trying to avoid animal cruelty through consumption while drinking coffee. This really impacted me. I don't think the solution is to just give up and eat meat, or not care about how my consumption impacts other living beings. Instead, I want to at least try a little to be better, knowing I can never be perfect. 


One problem is that I am a student earning roughly 24,000 per year, so I have a limited grocery budget. What can I do with limited funds to reduce how I directly fund exploitation? Which foods are most exploitative, and how can I get the most bang for my buck in terms of reducing exploitation? Its not even about ""voting with your dollar."" It's more about personally being disgusted that whatever money I have is funding slavery. I also no longer consume porn or new clothes besides underwear/socks (for at least a year now) for the same reasons, it's just disgusting to know that people are being trafficked and kept in terrible working conditions for my personal ephemeral sensory enjoyment. What should I do? The link argues that the only significant improvements in farm labor conditions have been fought for and won by organized labor. Should I just support organized labor instead of redirecting my personal consumption? It still personally disgusts me to derive sensory pleasure from slavery, so I want to do both. 


Also, if anybody says that the exploited workers of the world don't deserve compassion because most of them eat meat, just maybe consider the mass indoctrination that everyone faces to eat meat. And also maybe grow some fucking empathy. 


Tl;dr Humans are animals too, how can I avoid deriving unnecessary sensory pleasure from slavery? ",2,1753315999.0,vegan,0,0.67,False

The moment I stepped inside, the waiter, an older man, didn’t seem happy to see us at all (I don't know the guy and had never seen him before).

Nevertheless, we ordered our food. It was mid, nothing special. We asked for coffee, and when we called the man over, he just gave us a sideeye and kept walking away. That was strange. So, we called another waiter, and she brought us our coffee.

The restaurant has a refill policy, so we wanted a refill, and guess who was responsible for refills? The old man. He never came back to do it.

When we were about to pay the bill, he handed it to us with a 25% tip already added. Like… WHAT THE F\*\*\*?!

The dude didn’t do anything! So, I hesitated and didn’t want to pay the full 25%. He got very angry (which, honestly, he already seemed from the start). We ended up tipping him 10%.

To be honest, I think even 10% was too much for him.

Just a few updates on my progress:
⭐️I’ve been ordering matcha + hojicha directly from Japan to compare quality and flavor
⭐️I’m in the middle of recipe testing drinks using house-made syrups like mango, strawberry, yuzu, lavender 
⭐️I’m working with a designer to finalize the logo and brand vibe. We have several designs already, but want to make sure it captures the vibe that I’m trying to build

I’m getting closer to taste-testing stage and I’d love to connect with local folks who:
	•	Love matcha or are curious about it
	•	Want to try unique syrup flavors
	•	Have thoughts on what would make this kind of café feel really good to hang out in

👉 Would anyone here be open to giving feedback or trying some early samples down the line? I’m wanting to plan a free, pop-up event in Salem (TBD on when) to share matcha & hojicha drink samples and get honest community feedback.

It’ll be invite-only (just so I can prep the right amount), but totally free, just bring your thoughts and curiosity.

Would anyone be interested in coming? I’ll DM or reply with a quick RSVP form once I have a few details confirmed. It’s super important for me to gather feedback from the community to make sure I’m listening to what you all need & want (the researcher in me 😅)



📸 I’m also starting to post more on Instagram so I’d love if you followed along and provided me with some feedback! @uji_cafe

We unboxed and inspected the 1400-count package of Tupkee filters, noting the paper's texture and how easily the individual filters separated.\

A smart mug sounded kind of extra, like something I’d use once and forget about. But after actually using it day to day, it surprised me in a few ways.

The idea behind it is simple, it keeps your coffee or tea at the exact temperature you set. You can control it with the app or just use the default settings, and once it’s set, your drink stays warm until the last sip. For someone who gets distracted and lets their coffee go cold all the time, this thing is a game-changer. No need to microwave your cup or toss out lukewarm drinks.

Battery life could be better though. Without the charging coaster, it only lasts around 1.5 hours, maybe two if you keep the temp lower. That’s fine for a quick session at your desk, but not great if you're planning to take it around the house. Also, the Bluetooth connection can be a little buggy sometimes. It doesn’t always connect to the app right away, though it still holds your last-used temperature setting, which helps.

Build quality is solid and the design looks nice, but it’s definitely pricey. That’s probably the biggest drawback, it feels like a luxury item more than a necessity. It won’t change your life, but if you really enjoy hot drinks and hate reheating them, it does what it promises.

I want to give some back story about myself, maybe it means something, maybe it doesn’t. 

I was 16 years old when I got pregnant with my first daughter , 17 when I had her. I didn’t really think college was ever an option from me since childhood, my parents were both poor and using addicts. I never tried.

Fast forward , I had 3 kids, and I was working hard bartending and also as an esthetician/lash tech. I worked nights to avoid childcare costs ( dad worked a 9-5) I even bought a house, and financially, I would say I was doing nothing more than okay. My daughters were in a sport, I had a house and a car, everything was fine. I frequently supplemented the physical work with office work for temp agencies, family friends, etc, and I enjoyed it. I worked 50 hours a week, most weekends, but I really did make it work. 

Last October, my brother got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer at 29 years old. It moved into his liver , and things were really bleak. At the same time, my 14 year old dog passed away. 

I just shut down. I realized I had no savings. No good insurance. No future . No travel plans. And no time. No time at all, to travel and see my dying brother. If I stopped working, the money stopped coming. 

So, I quit my jobs. I cut down on expenses. Shit was really rough. I managed to dwindle my bills down and desperately turned to other options.

I heard about this company in my area that was known for its culture, and started looking at their postings. They offered remote work, good insurance, they had a ton of perks. But they all. Required. Degrees. Every single one.  And I didn’t have it. I had one technical diploma in esthetics , 3 kids, and no money.

So, I applied to WGU for business management . I finished in one term. Go ahead and read that post if you wish.

The day after I got that degree I applied to every job on that website and Human Resources called me the next day, a little confused. I told them I needed a career and who I was, and I got a job as Human Resources Business Operations lead. I didn’t have any experience, and it took a lot . I’m training still, but I’m typing this from my brothers house.  That’s all I cared about. I’m making more money than I ever have in my life. I certainly am not a CEO, but I went from a 30k salary and my partner making 25k , to me making over twice that and him able to be part time. 

I’ll go to WGU again and probably get my masters eventually. Anyway, I’ll see you at the Chicago commencement . Or, I might wait to see if they have anything closer for next year. 

My position isn’t entry level, and I love it so far. 

Some questions I was asked :
What degree ? Business Management 
How long did it take ? One term.
Did you do Sophia/ transfer credits in? No. My GPA was actually so bad that I had to take Algebra at the academy before they let me in.
How did you do it? Without any excuses and a ton of coffee.

What is your job? I’m a level 2 in the HR team on the operations side. My team looks over complaints, benefits , etc and pushes the paperwork to me, I check it over, approve it and fix it.

Everyone around me is either married, settled, or burned out. And all I want is something real something romantic, intense, fun, sexual, slow, honest.

I’ve tried the apps. I’ve tried putting myself out there. But lately it feels like everyone is armored up—like real connection is just something we used to do before phones, before dating burnout, before everyone became scared of each other.

I’m not looking for pity, and I’m not saying I’m owed anything. I just miss a world where you could share a poem with someone and they wouldn’t mock you for it. Where a smile in a coffee shop meant something. Where love could still feel like discovery, not negotiation.

I know she’s out there, someone curious, soft, real, and drawn to fire. I just wish the world was built to let us find each other.

1m7peea,https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomestories/comments/1m7peea/a_man_and_a_cat/,A man and a cat.,"One of the things my father always got right was how to act around animals ; it's magic to see him work around them. Animals don't necessarily trust him, but he trusts them. He always seems so careful around them, like he understood their needs. Chicken came up to him for rubs, sheep and even geese liked his company.

The old family cat, by the name of Chipie, who now spends her days snoring in front of the fireplace, was once a fierce and wild beast. An unapproachable wild animal, that carved some of the most beautiful scars I have. Fourteen years ago, we got her from the shelter, where she had already hurt every volunteer who held her - the lonely kitten with unending anger, who bit and scratched all the time. 
She was wild, and I took too long to realise that. My father, however, always kept his distance. He never got bit, never got scratched. 

One day, after eight long years, Chipie started being sick. She lost her energy, lost weight and became just a ghost of her old self. Her bites were soft nibbling, and all she could muster were low, weak grumbling. 
My father got her to the vet, who was meaner than the cat, and who dreaded her yearly visit. After examining the frail beast, she declared : ""She has a tumor. It's going to eat her away. Now, we can try and remove it, or you can try again with a nicer kitty. One that'll deserve the care you give out.""

My dad didn't respond, only nodded and paid his dues. His mind was set : we never leave anyone behind. 
A few days later, her surgery was scheduled. I nursed Chipie, tried to get her to drink, to eat, kept her out of the heat of the sun. It felt like I was holding a bag of bones.

The surgery came and my father was honest : a cat that's already that old could not handle the anesthesia well. He warned us that the tumor may come back. That infections existed. 
But he insisted that we were doing that for her, he said : ""If I was her, I'd want for people to take care of me. 8 years old is too short of a life.""

Obviously, that stubborn beast made it. The exact moment she drowsily walked into the living room, after she got back, we all felt like a switch flipped : she made her way onto the couch, and curled up right beside my father, like she never did before. 
She started to trust us. Accepted pets. Asked for food. Asked for pets. 
Chipie was still her old, grumpy self, but had welcomed us into her circle. My father, especially, became safety incarnate for her. She'd run to him every evening when he came home, and started laying down on his shoulders during breakfast. She'd scream for him to get her food, and would hide behind him in front of guests. 

A few years later, my father got sick. Inexplicable pain, that his doctor dismissed as migraines. He couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, barely could drink. It lasted 23 days, before we brought him to the ER.

He had a tumor. A tumor that was eating his brain away. However, he did not make the choice for it to be removed, as he was about to die from it. He lived through his operation. Battled through recovery, and got home with chemo. 

The very day he stepped into the living room, Chipie was waiting patiently for him, laying down on the couch's armchair. As he sat down, she sniffed his hand, and when she had confirmation that his favorite person was back, she headbutted it. She got up, stretched, and cuddled up against him, the same way she did when she was the one coming back. 

Everyday, now, as my dad sits down with his cup of coffee, the old tiger softens up, and comes up to cuddle. She gets up on his lap, and makes a comfortable little loaf of herself, all while staring at him. And she purrs. She purrs so loud he can't even hear the TV, sometimes. 
My dad is going through everything with so much strength, and I like to believe that every day, some of that strength is generated by an old tiger, curled up on his lap, purring as hard as she can. I believe she knows he's as sick as she was, and does her best to soothe him.",1,1753315166.0,wholesomestories,0,1.0,False

I was instantly shocked and started freaking out. I have always dealt with health anxiety as my dad passed about 10 years ago from health complications including diabetes. I hadn’t gotten my blood work done in 2 years and during that time I gained about 10-15 lbs. i was at my heaviest weight in about 3.5 years. I was finishing up college and definitely eating out more, drinking more, and not really exercising aside from a HIIT work out class here and there and some weights but not consistently. If I’m being honest I tried to cut back as much as I could but during the holidays I indulged a bit. Starting in January I started going on long walks and went on a fast at my church (only ate veggies and cut out caffeine) and I gradually started to see the scale drop as I was just eating smaller portions. I’ve gone from 146 to 130ish since last year and I’m 5’2”. I’ve never been super skinny always more of a muscular/fit build as I was pretty active growing up. I started a very stressful job that I was mostly sedentary at but I was still eating as clean as possible (a lot of salad, fruit, veggies, salmon, etc) during the week but I would enjoy myself with a few drinks here and there on the weekends and going out to eat a little more often as my doctor said to be more balanced and that it wouldn’t be healthy for me to cut things out cold turkey either. I cut out sugary coffees and mostly drank it black or with a splash of coconut milk but would treat myself on the weekend sometimes. Fast forward to June, and I quit my very stressful job. From March to June I wasn’t very active at all. I’ve thrown myself into going to the gym, walking, and eating mostly vegetables, salmon, nuts, berries, etc for the past few weeks. I’m honestly just scared. My doctor advised that I get my blood work done at my yearly check up again in October but we’ve talked a few times and she advised to ease my anxiety to get blood work done before then. I’m terrified and don’t know if I’m ready because I feel like I haven’t committed myself to a diet like I wanted to and I’m scared of the results. I’ve had some issues with sleep due to anxiety as well. This was my biggest fear since my dad has many self inflicted health issues. I can’t stop reading about symptoms that I don’t even have and googling things. Idk if I’m asking for advice at this point. It’s just driving me insane and I know stress does not help my health. Any words of comfort or advice would help. Thank you. 🤍",1,1753315046.0,prediabetes,2,1.0,False

My husband and I bought a small group of seasonal cabins in Colorado in 2019. We closed in the spring and the previous owners already had reservations for stays (off Airbnb) - most of the people were great but a few (predictably, the ones that had been staying for years with these previous owners) were rich older people that took a lot of ownership of the spaces and were not easy guests. 

One couple has just rebooked for next week and I don't know how to keep them from being the literal worst. I'm shocked that they would rebook after how they acted but it is what it is! Anyway:

What went wrong last time:
1. They showed up 1.5 hrs early when I was still cleaning and passive aggressively crowded me out.
2. The hairdryer broke and that ENRAGED the woman even though I immediately gave her a new one to use (it was working when she arrived, she admitted)...
3. Woman made a stink about paying because she wanted to use some specific credit card and made it incredibly difficult for me (changing her mind, cancelling the way to pay, etc). I ended up having to pay a fee for her canceling how she wanted to pay and I know it was intentional.

The worst one:
4. They took over our garage to store their things as well as take towels and food and made a mess (the previous owners gave them keys which has since been changed)

They took those WHITE towels and linens and threw them in the tub and put trash on top so everything leaked Gatorade and coffee and I had to throw the lot of them away.

Again, this was our first season renting and I still remember this because it made me SO MAD and I just didn't understand why someone would act this way.

They booked again and said, ""we've been here before ;) "" the lady immediately said she needed my help changing her way of payment and I said everything we do is through Airbnb now, so you have to call them, sorry!

I feel like she's haunting me and I wish they hadn't booked but I know if I cancelled I would be punished for it.

I have a greeting 2 days before guests arrive to remind them to use our driving directions to park  (they have to go down an alley) and I'm thinking about reminding her that they do not have access to our garage (we switched the locks and there is no way they can get in). 

I wish I could somehow ask her to be a little gentler with our space and not damage our new towels with literal garbage but I feel a little powerless. I was thinking ""please let us know if you need trash picked up, please don't leave it in the tub atop of our white towels."" Lol I'm sure that would go well, jk.

Grateful for any advice. Thank you!!

Not so interested in just standard portrait or fashion photography but also open to shoots involving traditional outfits or costumes such as kimono, saree, etc. You don't need experience or traditional model looks at all, just be fun and open minded. I most prefer a model who offers a degree of input and her own ideas. As per board rules I can't offer any payment but I am happy to treat you to a coffee or drink if you would like to meet up beforehand to decide if you are comfortable shooting, for example. You will also receive all the photos and can use them as you wish (for example on your own socials, etc.--as long as you give me credit). Thanks! 

Location would ideally be around Ikebukuro, but I am open to any other location that is most convenient for you. [https://maps.app.goo.gl/FBjG8kJuyo59u6tG8?g\_st=ac](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FBjG8kJuyo59u6tG8?g_st=ac)  ",0,1753313924.0,tokyoirl,2,0.25,False

I’m a 35-year-old nerdy guy from New England who’s deeply into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site. (Yes, really.)

Outside of cosplay as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things, Leon from Resident Evil along others, I take pride in dressing well, staying active with workouts, and—believe it or not—entering raffles and sweepstakes, which I tend to win more often than I should. Life’s been an interesting ride, including being featured on the local news for my fandom passions.

I’m looking to meet a woman who’s into nerdy things, likes to travel, and wants to build a meaningful connection. Cosplay is totally optional—it’s more about sharing good vibes, geeking out, and seeing where things go. A casual coffee would be a great start if you’re local.

1m7ovyz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7ovyz,"New Floors, New Paint, No Idea What to Do Next","Hey everyone! Please excuse the weens in the photos, they refused to move and honestly think they own the place.

I usually have a clear vision for my spaces because I love interior design, but for some reason, I’m completely drawing a blank with my living room/dining area now that we’ve redone the floors and painted. I want to restyle the space and tie everything together, but I need a little help getting there.

Some context:

* The floors and paint are new, so I’m working off a fresh base.
* Curtains in the photos are just experiments. I don’t like any of them. The terracotta ones used to work, but now they clash with the floor.
* My accent color is an army shade of green, and I want to do wood paneling behind the TV eventually to add texture.

Things I’m looking for:

* Rug: Needs to be washable and affordable because, well, the dogs have a rebellious streak when it comes to carpets.

* Curtains: Thinking chocolate brown to pull in the deeper browns from the countertop. I was thinking  a patterned curtain that adds interest but doesn’t scream “grandma’s lace collection.”

* Light fixture over the table: Open to replacing it. I had pendant lights that matched, took them down to try something else, hated it, and haven’t put them back up. If I do swap the table light, I’d want new pendants to coordinate.

* Bar stools: to tie living room and kitchen together 


* Corner next to the front door (behind the table): Used to have a bookcase there, but I’d love something decorative with a bit of functionality so open to ideas.

* Coffee table: Need one!

*Art work or focal pieces 

* Overall vibe: I gravitate toward modern and industrial, but open to anything that works with the vibe, and would love some inspiration for pulling it all together.

Where I usually shop: More budget friendly like IKEA, Amazon, Wayfair

If anyone’s up for making a mood board or has inspo pics, I would LOVE that. I’m stuck, but I know the space has a lot of potential with the right elements.",1,1753313769.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

I kept walking.

The sky over the Red Zone always looked heavier — like it carried more shit than the rest of the world. Cloudy even when it wasn’t. As if the smoke knew it belonged here.

I stepped over a crushed soda can, past a half-burned mattress, then down a crooked alley between metal walls rusted to hell. The city didn’t hum here. It hissed. It murmured like a bad secret no one wanted to be caught saying out loud.

But my mind was still back there.
With Gabe.
Or the ghost of who he used to be.

The way he stood.
The way he talked.
That terrifying calm that only comes from someone who believes not in an idea, but in themselves.

And I gotta admit, I admired it.
Even if I knew better.
Especially because I knew better.

You don’t get to build something clean out of spilled blood. I’ve tried. Gods, I’ve tried.

But no matter how noble the speech, how pure the cause — the moment you start spilling blood for it, something rots. Quiet at first. Then all at once.

He’ll learn.
And it’ll eat him alive.

I’m not mad at him.
I don’t have that luxury anymore.

The truth is, I get it.

His dad died believing in heroes.
And what did it get him?
A cheap grave. A ruined family. A pair of twins too young to understand what was taken from them.

So who the hell am I to judge Gabe for flipping the table and saying, screw your rules?

I pulled out one of my throwaway phones when it buzzed — fifth one today.
ID flashed: Zula 4.0 – DON’T IGNORE, ASSHOLE
I sighed. Picked up.

“Finally!” she snapped. “You piece of shit. Do you know how freaking annoying it is to call fifteen damn numbers just to guess which trash phone you’re carrying today?”

I rubbed my temple.

“I swear to God, next time you ditch me with a bunch of emotionally unstable brats in a bunker from hell, at least leave a damn note saying which number works!”

“Nice to hear your voice, Zula.”

“Don’t nice me, you son of a—! I’ve got a grieving kid melting reality, a dead girl in a pod, and no freaking manual on how to be a therapist-warrior-nanny all at once!”

I heard her pause. Breathing hard.
Then, colder:
“They’re ready.”

I stopped.

“Tom and Samuel?”

“Yeah. At your uncle’s place.”

“You sure they’re up for this?”

“No. I told you these psychos were a terrible idea like—what eight times already?”

I smirked. “Tom’s your brother.”

“Exactly why I know he’s nuts.”

“And Samuel’s your nephew.”

“Zenos, honey, listen very carefully: I. Don’t. Care. They’re both insane. Full-on ‘stab a toaster to see if it screams’ insane.”

I chuckled. “Look who’s talking.”

“Eat shit, Zenos.”

I hung up while she was still yelling. Tossed the phone behind me — let it disintegrate mid-air. Felt good.

I cracked my neck.
Rolled my shoulders.
Straightened my coat.

Time to go beg for help from people who owe you nothing —
and love reminding you of it.

Time to ask the mad to join the war.

And then I vanished.
Into the dusk.
Into blood.
Into whatever came next.

———

**Samuel**


There were five of me.
One tracing symbols in the dust near the window.
One reading a torn philosophy book upside down.
One perched on the ceiling like a shadow with teeth.
One humming a melody that didn’t exist.
And one — the real me sitting in the corner, back against the cracked wall, watching them all work.

They weren’t just copies.
They were thoughts.
Questions.
Slices of who I am — and maybe who I could’ve been.

Shadows teach you more than people.
People lie.
Shadows reflect.

Every voice that’s ever passed through this building still echoes in the dark if you know how to listen. Some talk of hunger. Others of betrayal. But most of them? Silence. That’s what they leave behind.

Tom was snoring on the couch again. Beer on his chest, cigarette on the edge of the ashtray burning too long. He didn’t move much. Never did.

But I liked him that way. Predictable.
There’s peace in someone who doesn’t pretend to want anything.

And then… the air changed.

No knock. No door creak. No warning. Just presence.
Like a weight dropped in the middle of thought.

I didn’t have to turn.

All five of me stopped.

They knew.

Zenos.

He always came like that — like guilt wrapped in command.
The kind of man who left truth in bruises and called it discipline.

I stood slowly. Let the clones melt back into me, dissolving into my shadow with a chill that made my spine flex.

And then I turned.

He was already looking at me with that face.
The one that says “I’m proud of you, but I shouldn’t be.”

I didn’t smile.
Neither did he.

“You look well,” he said.

“I don’t,” I replied. “But thank you for lying.”

He gave me that dry breath of a laugh. The kind that meant nothing.

“I came to ask a favor.”

I stepped forward, slow and quiet, until we were face to face. “Of course you did.”

He didn’t flinch. “We need you. The bunker is up. Leo is training. So is Danny. Clint’s in. Gabe… chose another path.”

“I know.”
Of course I knew.
I have eyes in shadows you’ve never even imagined.

“Tom is coming too,” he added.

Behind me, the couch groaned.
Tom had opened one eye.

“If he brings the beer,” Tom muttered, “I’ll go anywhere.”

Zenos didn’t laugh this time.

I kept my eyes on him. “You didn’t call me back then. When you chose the golden ones. The bright ones. The clean ones. You looked at me, and turned away.”

Zenos closed his eyes. “You were too dangerous.”

“I still am.”

“I know.”

Silence.

“I needed soldiers,” he said. “Not wildcards.”

“And now you need monsters.”

He looked at me. Really looked.

“Yes.”

I should’ve said no.
I should’ve made him bleed first.
I should’ve spat every truth I’ve eaten in the dark.

But I just nodded.

Not because I forgave him.

Because this fight?
It’s the only one I want to be part of.

“Let’s go then,” I said, grabbing my coat. It smelled like smoke and regret.

Tom stood, stretched like an old cat, popped his back and grinned.

“Hope there’s cigarettes where we’re going.”

Zenos nodded once. “You’ll like it. Plenty of things to kill.”

I stepped into the hallway.
Shadows peeled off the walls and clung to me like a second skin.

As we walked, I whispered to them.

“Watch everything. Listen harder. We’re going to war.”

And the shadows whispered back.

———

We landed in the middle of what looked like a bunker but felt like a forgotten museum. Cold walls. Low lighting. Smell of iron and stress in the air. Zenos didn’t even announce our arrival — classic. Just popped us in like a glitch in reality and expected the room to clap.

It didn’t.

Everyone just stared.

And I stared back, curious as hell.

I counted heads immediately — five, six, seven. Zula was the first to move, of course. Arms crossed, that look on her face like someone just pissed in her last cup of coffee.

“Told you not to bring the psychos,” she hissed.

Zenos didn’t flinch. “They’re family.”

“Exactly,” she snapped.

I grinned and stepped forward.

“Auntie,” I said, all love and venom, “you look lovely tonight. A little worn down, maybe. Like a raccoon in a thunderstorm. But charming.”

Someone laughed.

I didn’t catch who, but I appreciated them deeply.

Zula, of course, did not.

I turned to the others, tilting my head, scanning.

Leo was standing near a glass capsule. Barefoot. Face like someone who’s seen the edge and didn’t like the taste. Power clung to him like static raw, strange, and just barely held together.

I whistled. “You’re Leo? Damn. They said unstable, but that’s just rude. You’re a walking paradox.”

He didn’t answer.
Respect.

Danny looked more alert, built, wired like he was two breaths away from launching at something. Blood shimmered around his wrist like coiled whips. I could feel the edge on him.

“Impressive,” I nodded. “Controlled rage. Trauma boy chic. Love it.”

Clint stood farther back, quiet, watching me like I was an experiment. I gave him a little wave.

“And you… look like someone who’s only just now realizing he’s interesting. Welcome to the party, sweetheart.”

Zenos cleared his throat like he was about to say something serious.

I ignored him.

Walked over to the woman by the wall. Older than me maybe. Hard to tell. Everything about her screamed “too much life, too many regrets.” Her stance said warrior. Her eyes said widow. Her cheekbones said punch me and die.

I blinked.

“Sorry,” I said, utterly honest. “But what the hell? You’re beautiful. Like, it hurts. Seriously, it’s confusing.”

Zenos scratched his neck, clearly suffering.

“Samuel,” he murmured. “Tone.”

“Don’t blame me,” I said, gesturing wildly. “You bring me into a cave full of superhumans and drop Aphrodite in the corner. I’m just reacting.”

The woman Giulia, apparently blinked once. Then smiled. Just slightly.

“Thank you,” she said. And blushed.

Oh.

Worth it.

Jerrod was next. Kid looked too calm for someone in a place like this. I asked about his power, and he answered like it was a school project.

“I’m the golden hero, I have strength beyond human strength, and I’m hot…”

I didn’t let him finish everything, you know.
I nodded slowly.

“Very… standard. Like a starter-pack hero gift. You’re the action figure in the toy aisle they always discount first.”

He blinked.

Giulia smacked my shoulder.

“Be nice,” she said, half-laughing.

“I am,” I grinned. “That was the nice version.”

Zula groaned behind me. “I told you,” she muttered to Zenos. “He’s impossible.”

I turned back to her. “You love me. Deep down. Really deep. Somewhere under all that bitterness and those crushed dreams.”

She flipped me off.

God, it was good to be back.

———

The shadows were still warm from the sun.

I could feel it — that gentle heat tucked inside the concrete, like the ghost of a summer too stubborn to die. It clung to the ceiling and curled around the corners, sliding across my skin as I sat beside Zenos.

We were outside, on the bunker steps. Everyone else was inside winding down, cleaning up, passing out after another long day of blood and grit and dreams. The stars above were clearer than I expected. No towers here. No lights to outshine them.

And for a second, it felt almost peaceful.

“You ever think,” I muttered, “that time’s a bitch?”

Zenos looked up from his palms. Scarred. Tired. “All the time.”

I stretched, letting the shadows stretch with me, lazy coils that flickered against the ground like long black tongues. “These kids,” I said. “They’re something. Real power. Real drive. That Leo kid — shit. And the blood boy, Danny. Even Clint with the weird echo aura thing. This place’s got more raw potential than any of those gilded towers we grew up fearing.”

Zenos nodded, slow. “They’re becoming something. I just don’t know what yet.”

“And the redhead?” I grinned. “Giulia. Fuck me sideways, that woman’s a fireball. Short, pissed, beautiful. I think I’m in love.”

Zenos raised an eyebrow, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

“She really is beautiful,” he admitted.

“No, no, no. Not just beautiful, primo. Dangerously beautiful. Like, I-would-fight-the-Supreme-Court-for-a-glance beautiful. Imagine it: You and Elis, me and Giulia. We would’ve been the hottest revolutionary couples in the underground.”

Zenos froze a bit.
Just enough to notice.

“…Elis ended it,” he said, quietly. “It’s been two years.”

I whistled, low and long. “Damn. And here I thought I was your primo, your partner in crime, your emotional backup. But nooo, I only get called when your house is on fire. Not when you need someone to cry into beer with about your heartbreak.”

He laughed. Just a little.

“You’re an idiot.”

“And you’re an emotional cripple,” I shot back. “Match made in hell.”

We both laughed.

Then silence.

He turned his head, staring at the dirt beneath us. At the bunker’s edge. At nothing.

“I haven’t even processed it,” he said.

“What?”

“My father. Melgor. He’s dead.”

I blinked.

“What?”

He didn’t look at me. “Killed during the attack. Protecting the kids. Russell did it.”

My jaw locked. Blood boiled.

“…Why wasn’t it Zula?” I muttered. “Fucking hell, man. It should’ve been her.”

He snorted. “Don’t say that.”

“Too late. Already said it. Filed it. Published it in the official records of ‘Shit Samuel Thinks Out Loud.’”

But then I saw it — that look. The one that says I’m holding the world together with my teeth. So I dropped the joke. Just for a second.

“Primo… I’m sorry.”

“I know.”

Then the heat returned.

“I want to bring it all down,” he said. “The Association. The systems. Every lie. Every bastard in a golden cloak pretending to care.”

“I’m in,” I said before he could finish. “You know I’m in.”

He turned to me, half-smile fading. “But I don’t want to do it like before. Not like we used to. I don’t want blood to be the only tool.”

I leaned in.

“Then you’re teaching the wrong kids, primo.”

He blinked.

“You want them to survive?” I said. “Then teach them truth. All of it. The pain. The corruption. The cost. Don’t raise them on dreams. Raise them on war. They don’t need a professor. They need a wolf.”

He didn’t speak. Just watched me.

“My mother died,” I added, low. “I was what, nine? Ten? She vanished in a mission with Tom, and we never saw her again. You know who buried the report.”

“…The Association.”

“Damn right.” I stood up. “Since then? Anyone who comes between me and Tom dies. That’s not just survival. That’s the only way to live now.”

Zenos looked up at me like he saw the younger version of himself — the one who used to be angry for a reason, not just out of habit.

And then—

“WHERE’S MY GODDAMN CIGARRETTES?!”

Zula’s voice echoed from the door.

Tom was standing next to her, dazed and asking for smokes like a man who thought this was still 1994.

I smirked.

“Oh, you asked for this.”

And I stepped into Zula’s shadow.

Literally.

She froze as I entered, and before she could scream — I moved her.

Her arms jerked, her hips swayed, her knees bent in that god-awful dance from that meme she hates. Full marionette mode.

The others burst out laughing. Even Clint cracked a smile.

Zenos? He full-on lost it.

And through her forced shuffle, Zula glared at us and screamed:

“I TOLD YOU, YOU PIECE OF SHIT! THIS—THIS IS GOING TO RUIN OUR FUCKING LIVES!”

She pirouetted.
And I bowed.

Just another day at the bunker.

And honestly?
It felt like home.

Now, my situation was maybe a little less common -- single mom only 20ish years older than me, so she was in her thirties when I was a teen where I'm in my early 50s.  She was out dating and socializing and I'm a happily married homebody.

Mostly I have said (not always sure I mean it) that her lack of involvement in my teenage life wasn't bad.  She had her own adulting to figure out.  I was a pretty darned independent kid.  And here I am 35 years later ferrying my kids to work and sports (where I had to figure that out myself), buying them the snacks they want sometimes (okay, probably too often), talking to them about their friends and their schoolwork (I don't know if my mom even has any idea how I did in school, or what I struggled with).  Sometimes I feel like I missed out.

So why the post?  This last weekend, I was out for coffee with my mom and her husband and the kids.j  We were talking about how my kids want to cook.  (They can do ramen or scramble eggs but haven't done much and that is on me.) And my mom told them about how I got engaged at just-shy-of-18 and her first worry was, ""How can she be someone's wife?  She doesn't even know how to boil water.""  I could totally boil water.  I could cook and I could bake.  We were pretty poor, so if I was hungry, I had to use what we had, but this was the 80s.  There weren't all these convenience foods or they were around and we couldn't afford them.  So I made pasta sauce from scratch (canned tomatoes, but still).  I made pancakes and crepes.  I baked bread, ffs.

Suddenly, I was really bothered that she was around so little that she didn't even know that about me.  It's been stuck in my head since the weekend and it's driving me a bit batty.  I know there's nothing to do about it now but to do things better.  I don't doubt that she loves me or that I love her or any of that.  I'm just... hurt.

So I thought I'd vent here, where there's others that might get it.",38,1753313543.0,GenXWomen,14,1.0,False

* Picking up rental car by 10:30 AM
* Driving straight to Chuncheon

* Planning to visit Legoland (yes weather is bad but ticket are already paid and my daughters are hyped)
* Thinking of doing the skywalk in the morning
* Taking a stroll along the river

What else would you recommend doing after the theme park to make the most of my stay in the area?

Prior to Wellbutrin I normally had 1 BM  first thing in the morning after coffee - this was my habit for many years. Now they seem to come anytime of day multiple times a day. Anyone else experience this on Wellbutrin?

I run, lift weights and am in decent shape and my diet hasn’t changed much since I started the Wellbutrin. 

Colon cancer runs in my family so I booked an appt with my gastroenterologist to discuss, but it is for a month from now leaving me to worry about this sh1t. Really hoping it’s not that. Guess the Wellbutrin isn’t exactly helping with the anxiety like it used to right now.  Anyhow would love to hear the experience of others.

Been on for almost 3 months total. However, I’ve been experiencing some acid reflux and have been on 7.5mg for about ~ 1 month. The acid reflux started when I went to 5mg which was 2 weeks into use as my PCP said I can move up after 2 weeks on 2.5mg since it’s low. Truthfully I think I stayed at 5mg for only 4 weeks before jumping to 7.5mg.

My PCP prescribed me PPIs (pantoprazole 40mg) to combat the indigestion which has helped somewhat. But after about a month on the PPIs, the side effects really have started to suck to include brain fog, fatigue, and just feeling kinda out of it. Along with some anxiety.

Is there anything I can do to combat the PPI side effects as I’ve read they deplete you of essential vitamins necessary for cognitive function and brain health? I also have famotidine but I felt it didn’t really do much for me, I only took it at night too. Part of me just wants to move back down to 5/30 or even 2.5/15mg until I can kick the indigestion sides without having to take a PPI or any meds. My diet has been pretty decent, portions have been good. Could prob cut back on coffee if anything. Any help or sharing your personal experience with this would be appreciated.

I ended up just googling aftercare for mucocele removal, and the results were all over the place and confusing. Most of them said soft foods only, and since the procedure I've been living on water, Ensure, applesauce, mashed potatoes, and scrambled eggs.

Is this normal to walk out of the office with no paperwork? I feel like I'm going crazy.

Hey friends, let’s get real for a sec. Have you ever looked at your to-do list and thought, *“What fresh hell is this?”* 🙈 I mean, seriously—how is it possible that the simple act of living can result in such a chaotic scroll of responsibilities? Between work, chores, and trying to have a social life, it sometimes feels like the to-do list is just a monster that gnaws at our sanity!

✨ But here’s a little golden nugget that I’ve stumbled upon that changed my game: the **10-Second Rule.** Here’s how it works:

1. **Pause and Breathe:** Before you dive headfirst into that overwhelming list, take a deep breath. Seriously, just breathe. 😌

2. **Ask Yourself: “Can I Do This in 10 Seconds?”**  
   - If the answer is yes, **JUST DO IT.** 
   - This could be sending that email, putting away the dishes, or even washing a single coffee cup. The goal is to clear out the small stuff that clutters your mental space. 

3. **If It’s NOT 10 Seconds, Delegate or Postpone:**  
   - For those tasks that are a bit heftier, can you ask someone for help? Or maybe it’s something that can wait until later. Don’t be afraid to push it down the list.

4. **Celebrate the Small Wins:**  
   - That’s right! Each little task you knock off counts. Give yourself a mental high-five. 🙌

The magic of this rule? It breaks down the paralyzing feeling of having *too much* on your plate into bite-sized pieces. You would be amazed at how many little things you can tackle in just 10 seconds!

**Here’s a fun story for you:**  
Last weekend, I was buried under a pile of laundry and gazing longingly at my couch, wishing for just one day off. 🙁 I remembered the 10-Second Rule and thought, ""Okay, I can put away these socks in 10 seconds."" Before I knew it, I’d folded half the laundry. It was like a snowball effect! Once I got going, I felt lighter, happier. The couch didn’t seem so out of reach anymore! 

Ever had one of those moments? Isn’t it wild how our brains can trick us into thinking we can’t tackle tiny things quickly? 🙃 

Anyway, what do you think? Do you have your own version of a ""quick fix"" for a massive to-do list? Let’s chat about those little hacks that keep our sanity intact when life gets chaotic!",1,1753312481.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

6 regional sales reports.

All in different formats.

One in CSV (with no headers??), others in Excel with 12 tabs.

Every time, it took 2 full days to clean and consolidate.

Now? I hit ""Refresh"" and go make coffee.

Here’s the exact Power Query workflow I used to automate it all:

	1. Connect to Folder: I use Folder.Files() to pull every report from a shared drive.

	2. Standardize Headers: Created a custom function to rename columns like “Cust#”, “Client\_ID”, etc. into one standard: CustomerID.

	3. Clean Dates Automatically: Used try...otherwise to fix serial numbers and inconsistent text dates.

	4. Classify Transactions: Built logic in the Advanced Editor to flag returns, test data, and missing values.

	5. Apply Cleanup Functions: Reusable functions like fnCleanCustomerName and fnFixAmountField standardized every file.

	6. Optimize with Table. Buffer: Prevents Power Query from reprocessing slow steps multiple times.

	7. Append and Load: Combined everything into one table and loaded to Excel with auto-refresh.

Ever feel like you’re *running on a hamster wheel*? You’re hustling and grinding, yet somehow, your to-do list just never shrinks. I get it! I’ve been there too. But then, I stumbled upon the 80/20 Principle—an absolute game-changer that flipped my world upside down (in the best way possible). 

**What’s this 80/20 magic?** 🎩✨

Basically, it means that *80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts*. Sounds pretty simple, right? But applying this principle can save you loads of time and stress. Here’s how I did it:

- **Identify the Vital Few:** I sat down with my tasks and pinpointed the 20% that really moved the needle. For me, it was focusing on my main clients and key projects, instead of drowning in emails and meetings. Bye-bye, time sucks! 🚀
  
- **Streamline Your Day:** It’s all about *management*. I rerouted my daily tasks, prioritizing those magic 20% activities. Now, I tackle the most important ones when I’m fresh instead of scrambling at the end of the day. Who knew coffee could taste even better when you’re not in panic mode? ☕💨

- **Learn to Delegate:** If you’re like me, you might feel the need to do everything yourself. But letting go is liberating! I started assigning less critical tasks to my team. They thrive, and I get to focus on what really matters—*a win-win*! 🎉

- **Set Boundaries:** We love to say “yes,” right? But this can lead to burnout. Setting boundaries has allowed me to focus my energy on those key 20%. I’m not saying to become a hermit, but think about what you really want to invest your time in! 

- **Review & Adjust Regularly:** I check in with myself weekly to see what’s working and what’s not. Am I still focused on that 20%? If something's creeping into my must-do-It-all list, time for a real talk! 😅

Seriously, this principle isn’t just about cutting corners; it’s about working smarter, not harder! Since I embraced this mindset, I’ve saved at least 20 hours a week. That’s almost a full workday! 

Imagine what you could do with that extra time! Maybe pick up a new hobby, catch up with friends, or even binge that show you’ve been meaning to watch. 🛋️

So, next time you catch yourself grinding away, take a moment to pause. Ask, *Am I focusing on the 20% that matters?* 

Have any of you tried the 80/20 Principle? What’s your secret to working smarter? Let’s hear those winning strategies! 🥳",1,1753312459.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1m7odz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeXplore/comments/1m7odz7/plastic_coffee_containers_can_you_actually/,Plastic Coffee Containers: Can You Actually Recycle Them?,"Ever stood by your recycling bin, plastic coffee tub in hand, and wondered: 'Can I actually recycle this?' You're not alone. This simple question leads to a surprising amount of confusion, with conflicting information making it difficult to know if you're helping the environment or accidentally causing more harm.\
\
The short answer is: it depends. The recyclability of a plastic coffee container hinges on the type of plastic, your local recycling rules, and whether it contains mixed materials. This guide will walk you through exactly how to find out.\
\
Leveraging extensive analysis of recycling guidelines and packaging materials, we've created the definitive guide to answer this question once and for all. This guide unpacks the critical factors that determine recyclability, provides a step-by-step checklist for proper preparation, and explores sustainable alternatives for when recycling isn't an option.\
\
Key Facts\
\
\
  \
  Local Rules are Supreme: The single most important factor is your local municipality's guidelines. What's accepted in one town may be rejected in another, making local verification essential to avoid ""wishcycling.""\
  Mixed Materials are a Major Hurdle: Plastic containers with components like aluminum foil seals are challenging to recycle. Many facilities lack the equipment to efficiently separate these fused materials, leading to the entire item being landfilled.\
  Most To-Go Cups Aren't Recyclable: Standard disposable paper coffee cups are typically not recyclable in curbside programs because they have a thin plastic lining that is difficult to separate from the paper fiber.\
  #5 Plastic is Common but Complicated: Many large coffee tubs (like those from Folgers) are made from #5 plastic (Polypropylene or PP). While technically recyclable, not all recycling programs accept it, so you must check locally.\
  Food Contamination is a Dealbreaker: Any significant amount of leftover coffee grounds or residue can contaminate an entire batch of otherwise clean recyclables, causing it all to be sent to the landfill. Containers must be empty and clean.\
  \
\
\
Why Are Plastic Coffee Containers So Complicated to Recycle? The 3 Deciding Factors\
\
The recyclability of plastic coffee containers depends on three things: the type of plastic it's made from (e.g., #5 Polypropylene), your specific local recycling program's rules, and the presence of mixed materials like foil seals that contaminate the process. Understanding these factors is the first step to becoming a recycling expert in your own home.\
\
\
\
\
The Specific Type of Plastic. Not all plastics are created equal. The recycling symbol with a number inside—known as the Resin Identification Code (RIC)—tells you what kind of plastic it is. Coffee containers are often #5, but you might also find other types. Each number corresponds to a different chemical makeup, and recycling facilities are only equipped to handle certain types.\
Your Local Recycling Program's Rules. This is the ultimate authority. A c...",1,1753312444.0,CoffeeXplore,1,1.0,False

1m7ocww,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1m7ocww/prejudication_part_1/,Prejudication Part 1,"*Author's Note: My first story,* [I Hate Herbivores](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lehpbi/i_hate_herbivores/), *was well received. So, I decided to continue in this universe. I'm tentatively calling the series* Peace Through Fangs. *You don't need to read my first story to understand this one, but it might provide some context.*

The verdict didn’t take very long.  The foreman of the jury was a human, so I was able to understand him without my translator.  “Guilty.”

Per the request of the defense, I polled the jury.  All agreed with the verdict.  Six humans, two Kraetals, two Gweendions, a Gardeesian, and another Calluth.  It was a cross-section of the Oxygen Breathing races, and a fairly accurate representation of the local population.

When the polling reached the juror Calluth, her back-spikes jutted high and sharp, indicating great anger.  The purplish creature attempted to launch into a rant, but I moved on to the next juror without giving her a chance.  It was indicative of the general sentiment of the Calluth on Crion III.

And then I looked over at the accused.  It was another Calluth, his spikes limp with fear and submission.  Calluth were probably the least human looking of all the Oxygen Breathers.  The closest Earth animal to them was probably a spider or some insect, but that was still a stretch.  They walked around on six limbs around a circular body, each limb having digits that could be used to manipulate objects with perhaps a bit less dexterity than a human’s fingers.  Their skin was rubbery, and varying shades of purple, and they had four eyes encircling their body, giving them full coverage, inflatable spikes on their back that could be used for signaling their emotions.  The breathing hole they also used for speech was hidden among the spikes.  On the bottom of their body was a separate hole used for eating and emphasizing certain points in speech, and filled with sharp teeth.  When I asked the accused if he had anything to say, he let out a series of gurgles that my translator informed me meant “no, Your Honor.”  I called for a recess.

As soon as I was back in my office, I sighed.  Now the hard part began.  Interspecies trials were always complicated affairs, and that went doubly so with Calluth.  Values varied so much at an instinctual level, and that was exactly why the Galactic Accords had created the concept of Prejudication, the form of trial we had just completed.

The concept sounded insane to anyone who hadn’t studied the Galactic Accord in Law School.  In Prejudication the facts of what the accused was charged with were determined in the trial, but the formal charge itself was determined only if a guilty verdict could be reached first.  This tended to save a lot of headaches when cases were weak, in addition to avoiding jury nullification from jurors who disagreed with the exact details of the charges.

In this instance, though, the facts of the case were not seriously in dispute, and the jury was a formality.  The Defense made some token ramblings about “self-defense” against an unarmed human male half the Calluth’s size, because it was what was expected as part of the procedure.  But, no one really expected the jury to believe that.  The nature of the charges were always the real issue, and that decision fell squarely on me.

Marcus Hollander, the victim, was a mechanical engineer in the colony’s thulium mine.  The incident had nothing to do with that, however.  Hollander was literally just walking down the street, drinking from a bottle of water, and the bottle slipped out of his hand.  When it hit the ground, a little of it splashed on the Calluth.

That sounds inconsequential, of course, but this Calluth apparently believed some truly ridiculous stereotypes about humans.  While we aren’t the only species that can touch alcohol, we’re absolutely alone in our ability to drink and digest a chemical that many other species consider a weapon.  Since this played into our reputation as “those insane omnivores” in a Galaxy usually divided between Carnivores and Herbivores, the stereotype of the alcohol-drinking human tended to spread among those who’d never met them.  Maybe half of them even knew alcohol was an intoxicant for us.

Well, this Calluth was apparently under the impression it was our primary beverage, and believed that was what had spilled on him.  Since Calluth cells contained acetal linkages which would have broken down on contact with alcohol, the lack of searing pain should have been a clue to the Calluth that the liquid wasn’t alcohol.  But, somehow he jumped to the conclusion that he was about to die, at least for a moment, and used one of his appendages to strike Mr. Hollander in the head.

It was a stupid crime by a stupid young sapient.  It should never have happened, and had it been a human on a human-controlled colony, the charge would have been manslaughter, and that would have been the end of the matter.  Unfortunately, that was not the case, and now the whole thing fell into my lap.

One thing was always consistent about the carnivorous species that managed to reach sapience: they didn’t take chances.  This could often mean fairly draconian measures to bring any deviants into line in their societies.  It was easy to judge as a human, but we didn’t have razor sharp teeth or claws.  A society of beings who all had natural weapons could be a powder keg if it wasn’t kept in line, especially when they began to build cities, pack themselves into crowded areas, and build advanced technology.

The Calluth, though, were on a different level from most Carnivores.  In the view of the Calluth, deviance was dangerous.  That’s not to say they hadn’t learned to tolerate some variety, they had gay marriage, and supposedly some Calluth were transgender (I couldn’t tell their males from females either way).  But, when it came to anything that caused harm for another individual, the Calluth were brutal in their punishments.

The Calluth were from a planet only slightly smaller than Earth, but they’d never been able to establish a population greater than fifty million individuals, even now with the advantage of space travel.  The reason was that over half their population were sterilized as “deviants” at some point in their lifetime.  It was never clear if this was purely punitive, or if the Calluth were purposefully practicing eugenics.  The answer seemed to vary somewhat from Calluth-to-Calluth, and that was when someone was able to get anything other than an angry rant about “deviants’ in response to the question.  Weirdly, even already sterilized Calluth universally held these views.

But, that was for theft, injury, destruction of property.  When another individual died, the Calluth were very simple: Death Penalty.  Their laws had no equivalent of “manslaughter.”  Violence could not be tolerated in any form among the Calluth, and the idea that other species could tolerate it, at least by their definition of “tolerance,” was strange to them, in the same way the behavior of a toddler was strange to adults.  It seemed like it was something that we had simply not considered properly, as far as they were concerned.

This was my second Prejudication, but the first had already been difficult enough.  A Gardeesian had attempted to adopt a Kraetal child, failed to do proper research on the biological processes of Kraetals, and never realized their pheromone glands required manual cleaning by adults until the Kraetals were old enough to do it themselves.  It was child abuse, yes, I’d seen what the infection looked like.  But, the problem was that Kraetal eggs exchanged DNA with all the other eggs around them, leading to children with DNA from many parents sharing a communal nest.  The lack of a concept of “parents” made the whole idea of adoption foreign to Kraetals, and they had demanded the Gardeesian be tried for kidnapping, even though a Kraetal the Gardeesian believed to be the child’s “parent” had surrendered custody and signed the proper forms.

That time, at least, I had another culprit to blame.  I told the Kraetals that if they wanted to charge anyone with kidnapping, it was the idiot who signed over custody, and I sent the Gardeesian away for child abuse plain and simple.  The Kraetal in question was, of course, immediately charged with kidnapping.  How he wasn’t already charged at that point is beyond me.

This one was tougher.  One Calluth to blame.  I could tell the other Calluth already assumed I’d side with them.  I knew that, had the situation been reversed, they would probably have accepted the charge of manslaughter for the human.  They didn’t see non-Calluth as capable of being true “deviants,” we were beneath them.  So, should I give them the same consideration?  I wasn’t sure.

Every Prejudication allowed time for the judge to take consultation before rendering a charge.  But, I knew I couldn’t delay that way forever.

—

The next day, my first meeting was with the Defense Attorney.  It was a human man named Silas Murton.  Brown hair, thick glasses, and a voice way deeper than his slender frame would suggest.  I met with him for about an hour.  It was the usual song-and-dance we both knew he had to do.  “My client feared for his life,” nothing that hadn’t already been said to the jury.

There was some added talk this time about how Calluth absorb water through their skin, and often don’t even need to drink it directly.  So, obviously, the thought of drinking water never occurred to the accused.  I could tell Silas was getting desperate, since this part hadn’t even been brought up for the jury.

Eventually even I got sick of hearing it, and said “Silas, if he couldn’t tell the difference between being splashed with water, and a substance that would melt his skin, I’d question his sanity!”

Staring for a moment Silas said “Perhaps we could move for a new trial, and argue ‘Not Guilty by reason of insanity?’”  I wasn’t entirely sure if Silas was serious, especially since the Calluth didn’t recognize the insanity defense any more than they recognized manslaughter, but thankfully the time set aside for our meeting was up.

My next meeting, with no appointment, was the Calluth ambassador for the Crion system.  I’d never been able to learn her name, but thankfully she was so unaware of almost anything anyone else said to her that she’d never noticed whenever we met at social events for the local leadership.  Just as long as you remembered that she was the ambassador to the system, not simply to Crion III!  Crion III was the only inhabited body in the system, but the ambassador was going to be damned if someone denied her her rightful title as ambassador to a bunch of icy space rocks!

I would not have been surprised if my secretary had told me the ambassador had walked in unannounced.  Instead, I became aware of her decision to intervene in a matter that had nothing to do with diplomacy when I heard weird shrieking coming from outside.  My translator changed the strange noises to English. 

“Death, now!” was repeated over and over again.  Rushing to the window, I saw she was standing outside my office, holding up a sign in a language I couldn’t read, doing what could best be described as interpretive dance, with her back-spikes hopping up and down.  Apparently she had been made aware of the human concept of “picketing,” and decided this was the best way to get my attention.  Unfortunately, my ear-translator could translate neither body language, nor written language.  I could have pulled out my visual translator, but…no.

By the time I got outside several police officers had already surrounded her, unsure what to do given her diplomatic immunity.  I assured them I could handle it.  Then, I quieted her down by telling her how impactful her picket was, and asked if she could come inside for us to discuss the matter further.  She dropped the sign in the street, and followed me to my office.

My talk with the ambassador was no more productive than my meeting with Silas.  She wasn’t really there to present an argument, but simply to call the accused a “degenerate malloyas” (which I could only assume was an animal).  When I asked how she would view a reversed situation with a human causing the death of a Calluth, she assured me it would be judged by human law, since “you primitive magtolin can’t be expected to behave like Calluth.”  I didn’t point out that our “primitive” society had built our first interstellar jumper roughly fifteen years before hers.  The conversation took five minutes before she huffed out, with partially deflated but tense back-spikes, apparently believing that she had persuaded me.  It was at this point I realized that I would need to wrangle up some amicus curae myself, if I expected to get any meaningful input.

I had my secretary schedule a meeting with the family of the deceased for me the next day. I could have had them come into my office, but I decided against it. The Hollanders had not come to the trial of their own accord, I'd be damned if I was going to drag their faces through this process. So, I agreed to visit their home.

My secretary informed me I’d be meeting with Marcus’ mother, his next-of-kin.  Marcus did have three children who lived with his mother now.  As minors they didn’t get any official say in the matter, but I was prepared to hear from them if Grandma decided it was appropriate.

It was a nice, sunny day, grim duty or not, so around 10:00 I headed out. I did own a vehicle, but I rarely bothered with it. The colony was still sparsely populated, with only two judges needed, but it had grown large enough that most of the colonists couldn't recognize one of their judges on sight. I wore a hat and sun glasses just to be safe, on the off chance I ran into someone unhappy about their ruling. I just barely caught the bus, and made it to my destination at 10:30 as agreed.

The Hollander house was in one of the poorer districts of the colony.  The area wasn’t especially unsafe during the day, but after getting off the bus I did have to walk about half a kilometer down a dirt road.  The houses were all small, and mostly identical.  The outer parts  of the home were the plain black of carbon fiber.  All the houses in this district had been fabricated a few decades earlier, when the colony needed to import labor quickly.  No one had bothered to paint or otherwise color the houses then, and no one who still lived in them had the money to worry about painting them now.

The Hollander house, like all the others, had a single window that led into the kitchen.  Looking in, I saw a graying woman scrubbing dishes in her sink.  The woman’s face was stoic.  There were still plenty of locks of dark hair on her head, and only a few wrinkles, but her age was beginning to show in her appearance, and she moved slowly as she scrubbed, giving the impression of arthritis.

I don’t doubt that she saw me approaching, and knew who I was, but she didn’t react as I walked up the driveway.  She stayed focused on her scrubbing.  I gave the door a knock, and it came flying open.  A thin girl with wispy, honey-colored hair stood there holding the knob.  I got the impression she had been told to wait there and let me in.  Her mouth was a line, showing no sign of joy at my arrival.  She didn’t say a word, or direct me to her grandmother to my right.  She just turned, and exited stage left.  Her job was done, evidently.

Stepping inside, I glanced in the direction she had run.  She was long gone, but two boys who looked a few years younger than her sat on an old, red couch, playing whatever the latest game device was this year.  Or perhaps the prior year.  I had my doubts the family was up-to-date with technology.

Then, I glanced to my right, at the old lady.  There was no barrier between the living room and the kitchen, and she was looking over at me with a neutral expression.  She set the plate she’d been scrubbing on her drying rack, and took the cane she’d propped up against her counter.  With a slow but even pace, she started in my direction.

“Mrs. Hollander?” I asked, as she approached.

“Call me Janice,” she said, wobbling slowly into an easy chair.  She motioned me towards the only other chair in the room, an old rocker.  I politely sat down.

“You want some coffee?” Janice asked.  “I’m not standing up again if I can help it, but if I yell Maggie will still come.  She knows to mind her granny, and she can make coffee.”

“No thank you…Janice,” I said.  “I just wanted to…well…assess with you.  I understand why you wouldn’t want to attend the Prejudication, but I do think the family of the deceased should have some input on the charge.”

The old woman smiled in a less-than-sweet way.  “Assess with me before you give the Calluth his coffee?”  She laughed.  It was well-known that caffeine was deadly to most alien species, and “giving coffee” was sometimes used as a euphemism for a human killing a non-human sapient.

I nodded.  “So…I take it that’s what you want, Janice?  For your son’s killer?”

She frowned and looked down.  It looked as though it just hit her what she’d said.  I could see tears she was fighting back at the mention of her son.  Finally, she replied.  “What difference does it make now?  It won’t bring him back.”

“Justice?” I asked.

She looked back up at me.  “That’s just a word!  My son is gone!  My granddaughter is acting like such a snot every time she opened her mouth I finally just told her if she can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all!  And, you already saw how she took me up on that.  And the boys,” she motioned to them, totally absorbed in their game, unaware of my presence.

I wished that I’d accepted the coffee, if only so I could buy myself a few more seconds without having to speak while I downed it.  “I’m sorry for your loss, Janice.  I wish there was more I could do.”

“There’s nothing anyone can do, now,” she said, all bitterness.

“...and, I understand there’s no mother?”

“Nah,” she said, looking momentarily almost content at the chance to reminisce about her boy.  “Marcus always wanted kids, but he was never good with women.  Not romantically, I mean.  Never really interested, but he had every type of friend you can imagine.  So, this gal-pal of his agreed to have Maggie for him for a lot less than it would normally have cost him to get a surrogate.  Then, a few years later, she sees Maggie and decides maybe she does want to be a Mom, but all by herself, same as him.  He gives her more…DNA, but two embryos take instead of one, and she ends up with twins.  Then she finds out what kids are like screaming all night, and she decides she doesn’t want them anymore, and Marcus just takes them too.  And, well, here we are…”  I could hear the contempt Janice still had for this deadbeat woman.

“So, now it’s just you?”  I asked

“Yeah,” she said.  “We’re cashing in Marcus’s retirement account, but it wasn’t that much.  It could last us a while together with mine, but not really get us over the finish line, if you get my meaning.”

I nod.  “I do.  So, what’s your current plan?”

She shrugged.  “Back to work for me, I guess.  I could sue that Calluth’s Estate after he’s dead, I guess, but he’s pretty young for a Calluth, so I doubt he’s saved much.  Not that Calluth usually own much personally, at least according to what Marcus told me.  I don’t really know much about them.”

“He was right,” I said.  “Calluth are very communal creatures.  They tend to save a bit of money when they live under less collective governments, but if they accumulate much they tend to transfer it to funds that pay out to less wealthy Calluth.  They’re all reliant on each other.”

She nodded.  “Well, that settles that, then.”

I asked the hard question.  “Will you be able to work?”  I didn’t mention her cane directly, but I saw her grip it.

“I will,” she said.  “A friend of mine can arrange a data entry job recording incoming cargo.  I can sit while I do it, I just need to be able to type and read the manifests.  Not a whole lot else I can do.”

I rubbed my chin.  “And what do the children think of this?”

“The children?  Well, who knows what Maggie thinks at this point, we can’t exactly afford a shrink for the poor girl.  As for the boys, I don’t think they’re far enough past realizing their Daddy is gone for them to process how hard it’s going to be for Grandma now.”

I wanted to comfort the woman, but I felt like I had to get back to the subject at hand.  “So…would you be upset if the Calluth that killed your son lived?”

She stared at the wall before answering.  “Upset?  I don’t know.  Lock him up for a few years like you would a human and I’d be fine, probably.  He didn’t set out to kill Marcus, no matter how stupid he was.  Even if you just let him go, I guess I would still have more important things to worry about right now.

I gave her a nod, realizing there was little more to discuss.  We talked for another few minutes, until I felt I could politely excuse myself.  As I made my way to the door, I glanced back at the boys.  Maggie was still in hiding wherever she was.  I wanted to say more, but I didn’t know what.  So, I let myself out.

—

From my meeting with Janice I could have gone directly to speak with the accused.  While the Right to Remain Silent isn’t as formal among the Calluth as it is with humans, they do generally understand that trying to compel confessions is pointless for anyone who cares about the truth, so it’s generally still understood.  Accordingly, the Calluth had let Silas do the talking, and it seemed logical at this point to finally hear from him.

But, honestly, after seeing the state he’d left Marcus Hollander’s family in, I wasn’t sure I was in a fit state to judge him.  I needed some breathing room, and some time.  Instead, I asked my secretary to make a meeting for me with Gallor, the Matriarch of one of the local Kraetal Households.  Gallor had been a great source of advice in the Gardeesian’s judgement, and I’d gone to them for advice a few times since.

Why “them?”  Well, Kraetal concepts of gender are…different?  They don’t really have distinct biological sexes, so pre-spaceflight the idea of “gender” never really occurred to them.  But, when they ran into races that did have it, they decided it was a good idea.  But, they also decided a “gender” was something you had to earn.  So, most Kraetals still go by they/them when using gendered language.  He/him pronouns are reserved for individuals who’ve performed great feats of strength or athleticism, and she/her are reserved for the heads of communal Households.

Gallor had earned both titles-the only Kraetal on the colony to have done so.  Unfortunately, this meant that I had to wait to see Gallor had dressed on a particular day before I knew their correct pronouns.  I honestly hoped that Gallor was presenting as female today.  While he could still provide advice while male, receiving that advice generally involved showing “spirit” by competing with him in some athletic competition no one seriously believed a 53-year-old human who worked a desk job could win.

I let out a sigh when I arrived.  It was Saturday, I’d been so wrapped up in the case I hadn’t noticed until the meeting was already arranged.  While Kraetals on their own planets followed a pattern of six-days-working/three-days-off, but they adopted human weeks on our planets, so almost all the Kraetals were home.  The household was three stories tall, made of white marble mixed with bits of wood and red brick in what looked like a mish-mash to human eyes.  Supposedly, Kraetals found the look aesthetically pleasing.  But, the outer courtyard was already flooded with clusters of socializing Kraetals, and I had no doubt the inside was the same.

The Kraetals were scaly, reddish bi-peds with huge mouths full of sharp teeth, a head that somewhat resembled a komodo dragon, and clawed hands.  They mostly stood about seven feet tall.  Strangely, they were among the most human-looking sapients we’d encountered.  Also, one of the “friendliest” species we could share an atmosphere with except for maybe the Facultative Anaerobic Marmallions.  They were pack animals and, like most predators, slow to employ violence.  But, unlike the Calluth, the Kraetals tended to view deviation as a problem to be addressed, rather than an evil to be smited at once.  And they were often quite amenable to at least hearing out the perspectives of others.

Kraetals found humans quite fascinating.  As the only sapient omnivores, our perspective were never quite what any other race would expect, and that made us a favored topic of discussion among Kraetals.  On a few rare occasions Kraetals had even been known to attend the funeral of a human, finding their absence unsettling.

It took a while to force my way through the hallways, trying to move past the clusters of talking Kraetals.  Kraetals didn’t put a lot of focus on common activities, or even bothering to sit down, when they socialized.  Instead, Kraetals went through phases of “listening” and “talking” that tended to last for days or weeks.  Whenever a Kraetal had enough thoughts in their head to enter a “talking” phase they would begin producing a specific pheromone, which they could release during appropriate times for socialization (the entire Household stank on their days off, sadly), and all the Kraetals in their “listening” phases nearby would gather around to take in whatever this Kraetal had to say.  Eventually the “talking” Kraetal would run out of thoughts to share, and the “listening” Kraetals would have listened to enough talkers to enter their own “talking” phase.  Thus, the cycle continued week after week, with gossip and trivia being shared one week and responded to the next.

It was an efficient system, but it also led to these giant clusters of Kraetals standing randomly around their hallways, spreading that disgusting odor, and forcing me to politely ask to pass over and over again.  I sometimes wondered if they should install some sort of overhead passageway to allow other species visiting to get by.

Thankfully, I was familiar with the general set-up of the Household, so I forced my way, little-by-little, towards the Meal Area.  On top of the irritating smell, and the crowded passages, my translator kept giving me snippets of all the random topics the Kraetals were discussing.  “And I heard when they laid eggs…I think I could convert human films to a range of light waves more conducive to our eyes…Fucking Gweendions, do they ever stop complaining?”

I eventually just flicked my translator off.  After that I was able to make my way mostly by saying “excuse me,” and trusting their translators to let them know that I wanted to get by.  It took me a good forty-five minutes.

Kraetal Meal Areas were generally built around a cage, commonly two meters across, but only half a meter tall.  On top of the cage there were multiple doors that any Kraetal could open to retrieve juna, furry creatures that had been bred to have no bones, and to make as little noise as possible to disturb the peace of the Household.  Watching Kraetal stuff juna in their mouths was always unsettling.  I always had to look away, and hoped the poor things couldn’t feel pain, although such thoughts never seemed to concern the Kraetals.

I was relieved to see Gallor standing on the far end of the room.  I was even more relieved to see metal rings hanging from the piercings where her ears would be, if Kraetals used ears to detect sound.  It was a signal of female-ness for today.  It would make my job easier.

She wasn’t looking straight at me when I entered.  Thankfully, the Meal Area was large enough that I was able to go around the two or three clusters scattered around the room.  I was about a meter away when she finally noticed me, and turned to look down at me.  I flicked my translator back on.

Kraetal faces always appear stoic to humans.  It’s not at all inaccurate to their personalities, truth be told.  But, there was something in her face I couldn’t quite put my finger on that let me know she was irritated about this meeting.  I wasn’t sure if my secretary had told her the reason I wanted to see her, but when she saw me she said “It’s about that Calluth, isn’t it?”

—

A few moments later, we were in Gallor’s quarters.  Kraetals didn’t really have the concept of an “office.”  Even her quarters were fairly sparse, as Kraetals typically slept on bare rock floors.  There were two chairs, big enough for Kraetals, but usable by humans.  Kraetals didn’t really need to sit, but they could assume that position if necessary.  And, they often found that doing so made humans far more comfortable when trying to hold a conversation.

“Why do you believe my advice would be helpful in this matter?” asked Gallor.

“I don’t know if it will,” I said.  “But, sometimes a new perspective can be…enlightening.  I know what the Calluth are going to say, and I know…well, I know humans would have a pretty wide variety of opinions, like we do on everything else.”

“Indecisive omnivores,” said Gallor in a statement that seemed to roughly resemble a joke.

“Yes, but I think a majority of us would say unintentionally causing a death shouldn’t be a capital offense.”

“Kraetals would agree.  Violence cannot be tolerated, but it can only be deterred so much.”

“Exactly.  So, as hard as I try, I don’t see how anyone benefits from this Calluth’s death.”

Gallor remained stoic.  “And what would happen if you charged him under human law?”  Given how much time Kraetals spent on gossiping among themselves, it was surprising how direct they could be.

I shrugged.  “Then the Calluth woud be guilty of manslaughter.  The sentencing guidelines for a first-time offender, with no other extenuating circumstances, would recommend ten years.  I’d be inclined to follow those.  But, the other Calluth would be furious, relations could deteriorate, and when he’s released the guilty Calluth would probably never be accepted back by his own people.  Hell, they’d probably try to kill him themselves if they get the chance.”

“And if you use Calluth law?”

“Then he's executed immediately, and a lot of humans are furious, and I get the reputation as a ‘hanging judge.’”

Gallor seemed to consider for a moment.  “It is strange that Calluth law is so simple on such matters.  I had to download the file on Gardeesian law from the Colony library during our previous trial.  The Calluth file was in the same archive.  I noticed that it was larger than any other species’ Law File.”

I chuckled.  “Yeah, centuries ago the Calluth consolidated their entire homeworld under one government, but it took decades of bickering.  Every Calluth ethnic group wanted to keep their own laws.  So, the whole planetary constitution became swiss-cheese on paper from all the carve-outs to keep old laws intact for the descendants of specific clans only.  But, Calluth are so conformist that after a generation or two as a united people, they rarely bother to actually invoke any of the old laws outside of a few land disputes, so most of those laws just sit there.”

“What types of laws?”  I wasn’t sure if Gallor was still trying to help, or was just curious.

“I read a bunch of examples a long time ago.  One ethnic group can’t be required to pay taxes on the first five hundred kilograms of meat their herders produce per individual per year.  Another is supposed to have been exempt from government service drafts during specific ages.  There’s one group that can’t be charged with destruction of property if they damage a specific type of fence.”

Gallor paused again.  “Do you remember how humans convinced the Amendment Committee to allow storage of recreational alcohol?”

“Not really,” I admitted, confused.  “I just know it was amended.”

“One of your lawyers argued that an inability to consume alcohol would result in greater stress and thus less industrial production from humans, thus making recreational consumption of alcohol de facto Industrial, and thus allowed.  Most of your worlds said they’d enforce the law with that understanding.  Eventually, most members of the committee were so annoyed they agreed to the amendment just to be done with the matter.  Why is the species that can make such an argument unable to wring something useful from the jumble of Calluth nonsense available to you?

“You want me to Rules Lawyer the Calluth with their own laws?”


“Why not?”  I was sure that, had he been human, Gallor’s expression would have been stoic.  “They’re in your courtroom.  It’s a human tactic, so use it.”

I’d be lying if I said this hadn’t occurred to me, but the Calluth Law File was intimidating.  Aside from that, I had my doubts that this one specific Calluth would even know his official ethnicity, let alone that his ethnicity would just happen to have exactly the right law to help us.  Still,  Gallor was right that it was worth trying. So, on my way home I downloaded the Law File onto my datapad, promising to look over it later.

I've developed a small web app that corrects text you write in a foreign languages to have an immediate feedback on language errors. There are a lot of more features I could implement, but I want to nail that one first before moving to the next one.

Now the application is at a pre-MVP stage. All the functionalities work as intended, but there are probably some bugs and I'm still waiting to get better looking visuals.

Regardless I would like you to get some feedback from you regarding the landing page and the usability. Feel free to write me an DM and I give you full access to the app.

One big pain and advantage at the same time is the unique UI. My idea is to have an immersive experience as if someone is studying a new language at a coffee shop. But since the elements are hidden in object and not as clear as in usual websites I believe some people will have problems to fully use it. What could I implement there to guide the user through the app. I am not a big fan of tutorials that are like manuals and just explain the different elements.

So I was wondering if we have like a recipe wiki that has the best/tried and true recipes for most of the dutch bros drinks especially for those who cannot afford to keep going to dutch bros on a daily basis. 

I was looking for the recipes to the following: 

1) Irish Kicker 

2) Golden Eagle

3) Mudslide Mocha ( Instead of dark chocolate and milk, can I get store bought chocolate milk? Will it make a difference?)

4) Snickerdoodle

I was wondering if we don't have a recipe wiki like that, then maybe we could make this thread into something of a recipe thread? I noticed that there are many, but there isn't one centralized source

I get things done. I’m raising my kids, I work, I have a few friends and play tennis etc. There’s a lot I’m grateful for. But deep down, there’s this sadness/loneliness that doesn’t really go away. I just went for coffee with my friends and then played tennis with a few of them but as soon as I got in my car I felt it again.

It’s not about needing someone to save me or fix anything. I just know that there’s a part of me that’s made to love and be loved in a way that can’t happen without that kind of relationship. Not just any relationship, but the kind where both people are absolutely smitten with each other, where there’s real hunger and safety, where it’s deeply mutual. Where there is no care about which restaurant we went to or what car we have because we have each other. Where there is no fear about sharing your inner fears because you both know they will be cared for.

I’ve tried to live like it doesn’t matter but I’ve now realised that feeling like this is me not pushing it down. I think I need to keep feeling like this in order to give myself any chance of having it. I’ve focused on healing, parenting, working and emotional growth. But that part of me still pops up frequently the moment I’m quiet/not busy. And sometimes it feels like the rest of life just moves on around that sadness. I’ll never be content with anything less though. I’d always know something was missing after what I’ve learned about myself (or rediscovered).

But after diving into this trend, I'm totally sold. Here's why moss art is actually genius:

# 1. Zero. Maintenance.

https://preview.redd.it/m7n33nk7epef1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccae36f028452b296cb670e4e00a72d66d9519b8

I'm the person who killed a cactus, so when I say this requires NO care, I mean it. The moss is [preserved](https://exoticplantsltd.com/moss-art/) (basically pickled in glycerin), so it stays green and soft forever without water, light, or any attention whatsoever. You literally just hang it and forget it exists.

Perfect for people like me who travel a lot or just suck at keeping things alive.

# 2. It Actually Makes You Feel Better

This isn't just hippie nonsense - there's real science behind [biophilic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophilic_design) (fancy term for ""nature indoors""). Studies show that even looking at green, [natural textures](https://exoticplantsltd.com/moss-art-gallery/) reduces stress and helps you focus.

I put a small moss piece in my home office during a particularly brutal work period, and I swear it helped me stay calmer during video calls. Could be placebo effect, but honestly, who cares if it works?

# 3. You Can Make It Look However You Want

https://preview.redd.it/0opfd1idepef1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3021be4f80d27ce6f6a0c0a7bb060097a72e9ce

Unlike buying a print on Etsy, moss art is completely customizable. Want your company logo? Done. Abstract geometric pattern? Easy. Spell out profanity? ...Probably possible.

You can mix it with other preserved plants, use different frame styles, even dye it different colors. It's like having a craft project that actually looks professional when you're done.

# 4. Works in Any Space

Tiny studio apartment? A small moss panel adds life without taking up precious floor space. Big blank wall that needs something? Scale it up into a statement piece.

Bonus: it absorbs sound, which is clutch if you live in a noisy area or work in an open office. It's functional AND pretty.

# 5. You Can Learn This in One Afternoon

https://preview.redd.it/74iyyzufepef1.jpg?width=206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d32c4c909a7652fd858ddeb7d36281f0560a1193

I went to a workshop expecting to make something that looked like a kindergarten craft project. Two hours later, I walked out with something I'd actually pay money for in a store.

The process is weirdly therapeutic too - very meditative and a nice break from staring at screens all day. Now I'm planning my next piece.

**Shameless plug:** If you're in the area and want to try this, [Exotic Plants LTD](http://exoticplantsltd.com). is teaching a workshop on August 16th. You'll make your own piece to take home and learn enough to keep making them if you get hooked like I did.
