It‚Äôs intense but exciting, and I‚Äôm hoping to also start working in the city soon!

Outside of school and commuting life, I have a lot of hobbies that keep me grounded. I‚Äôve been into penpalling and journaling for a few years now. There‚Äôs something so calming about putting pen to paper, don't you think? I especially love cute stationery, washi tapes, and thrifting little treasures for my journal spreads. I also like traveling and exploring to new places, not to mention seeing cute mascots such as Miffy and Maltese from Miniso.

I‚Äôm also into creative writing, usually character-driven stories with a touch of fantasy or emotional depth. I game casually when I can, mostly Fallout 4, Skyrim, and I recently picked up Witcher 3, which I‚Äôm excited (and a little intimidated) to dive into.

Other things I enjoy:

* Thrifting / secondhand finds
* Coffee (especially with cinnamon or oat milk!)
* Long train rides with a podcast or lo-fi playlist
* Organizing or decorating my space

***Wednesday***

By the time Boyd made it back to the apartment building, he wasn‚Äôt angry anymore. He was empty. Like nothing left in the tank. Numb. Yeah, that was the best word for it.

He reached the alleyway that ran alongside the building and paused. They had divine visitors today, and the last thing Boyd wanted to deal with was more of their bullshit. If he were lucky, Larry would spend the whole day with Rory and jump between him and the two Mystallians that mattered and stay the fuck away from him.

He‚Äôd never once, not in ten years, ever regretted his friendship with Larry.

Until today.

Should he mention Larry‚Äôs clinginess to Dr Kearns?

He bounced that idea around for a few seconds before shaking his head. *Nahh‚Ä¶* Best case scenario, Dr Kearns would say Larry was coming from a place of love and side with the asshole against him. Worst case, Dr Kearns would side with him and push him to file a restraining order against Larry. The latter would put Dr Kearns firmly on Larry‚Äôs shit-list, and nothing human could survive that.

More emptiness at his helplessness to fix this sank in ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ right before his appointment with Dr Kearns.

*Great.*

He pulled out his phone and speed-dialled Robbie, with his friend picking up on the second ring. ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs up, big guy?‚Äù Robbie asked, causing a hint of a smile to twitch along Boyd‚Äôs lips.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the head of the alleyway on our side of the building, and I was wondering if you wouldn‚Äôt mind coming and grabbing me. I kinda want to avoid everyone else right now.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúUh-oh. What did Larry do?‚Äù

Because, of course his friend remembered their blowup the night before. Boyd lifted his chin to look at the sky overhead and sighed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it right now, man. Can I just get the assist and leave it at that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOn my way.‚Äù The click of the phone sounded so final, yet before Boyd could lower his hand, Robbie stepped out of the laneway beside him. Without asking, the former sex worker slid his arm through Boyd‚Äôs bent elbow and walked him farther into the alleyway.

Boyd only realised they‚Äôd stepped through the celestial realm once he was already inside his studio. Robbie manoeuvred him *(manhandled,* if Boyd was being honest) onto his stool behind his workbench, then raised a hand. ‚ÄúStay there,‚Äù he said, and realm-stepped away.

After fighting so hard with Larry about being told what to do, he didn‚Äôt have the headspace to snarl at Robbie for the same thing. Instead, he dropped the duffle on the floor beside him and leaned forward on his forearms, staring at the piece he‚Äôd left on the wheel to finish up.

It was another one from the set belonging to Dr Kelly‚Äôs father. This was of a prepubescent child, nursing a ferret of some sort. The child was looking down at her pet, but something in the eyes wasn‚Äôt quite right. At least, not to his satisfaction.

And then it dawned on him what it was. The teen was looking at the ferret, her beloved pet, and there was no emotion in the eyes. That‚Äôs what was missing. The look Mason had when he stared at his service animal.

His tools were still locked in the biometric safe in the footwell under the workbench, and if he pulled them out, he could fix everything with a light shave of a couple of lines, adding a sense of wonder to the teenager‚Äôs gaze.

The more he looked at the piece, the more he felt his earlier dejection wash away, until finally he pushed away from he bench and bent over at the waist, pushing the ‚Äò*2*‚Äô button and laying his thumb on the biometric scanner to open the safe. Technically, it was his safe, but for consistency, he‚Äôd insisted on Lucas taking slot ‚Äò1‚Äô ‚Äî just like his gun safes. The tools might be divine, but in his mind, guns still trumped chisels, even if they were divine.

As soon as he unrolled the tools and got to work, time slipped away from him.

He hadn‚Äôt realised how much time until his first alarm went off, indicating he needed to get ready for his doctor‚Äôs appointment.

In his head, he knew he‚Äôd finished not only that piece for Dr Kelly but had nearly completed another as well. Still, when he‚Äôd finished the first one, he‚Äôd been so in the zone that reaching for the next piece of timber from the storeroom had felt like part of the same motion ‚Äî a seamless transition that never broke his flow.

Even now, he only had to separate the loose shoelaces from the sneakers that the teenager wore, and that one would be complete as well. A minute at best ‚Ä¶ probably a few more seconds ‚Ä¶

The alarm continued to blare, reminding him that he really did need to step back from his work. He didn‚Äôt want to, but he had to.

With an unhappy groan, he pushed the tools into the sleeves and rolled up the set, returning them to his safe. Then, and only then did he turn off his alarm. In the past, he had caught himself twice turning the alarm off, and then going back to work instead of leaving, so now he didn‚Äôt trust himself not to do the right thing.

He stood up and looked down at his work, happy with both pieces.

‚Ä¶and from this extended height, he finally noticed the insulated traveller‚Äôs mug that had been placed on a coaster within arm‚Äôs reach. Close enough to be thoughtful, not close enough to break his focus. He picked it up and took a tentative sip, finding an extra-rich hot chocolate with a hint of vanilla cream where his coffee would typically be. If Robbie had brought it straight back after leaving him, he‚Äôd been so in the zone when he got up to get the new piece of timber that he hadn‚Äôt seen it then either.

Nevermind. He was enjoying it now.

As he took another deep swig, he picked up his phone and called Robbie once more. ‚ÄúHey, you good to help me load up some boxes?‚Äù he asked, as soon as his friend picked up. His mood was so much better now. Not the *‚Äòhappy to have spent the morning with his fianc√©‚Äô* kind of happy, but happy within himself. He felt at peace, and that would be really helpful going into a therapy session.

‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù Again, Robbie hung up, only to appear at his side a moment later. ‚ÄúSo, how many are you and Larry taking today?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I was hoping you would take me, if that‚Äôs okay?‚Äù

Robbie arched a wary eyebrow, and Boyd shook his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. I just ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt deal with him right now. If I thought it would work, I‚Äôd smother him in his sleep tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you talk to Dr Kearns about it?‚Äù

Boyd shook his head, leading them into the drying room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll only make things messy when I leave it as long as possible to draw on the veil. I‚Äôd rather not do that to him at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you talk to Lucas tonight?‚Äù

Boyd huffed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see. It‚Äôll depend on his day,‚Äù he added, when Robbie went to argue. ‚ÄúIf he has another day like yesterday, no. It‚Äôs not important.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you crazy? Of course it is, because you‚Äôre important to him. You‚Äôd be pissed if he had a falling out with Pepper or Daniel and kept it from you, and don‚Äôt pretend otherwise.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. Okay. I‚Äôll talk to him at some point tonight. Happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI will be, once you do.‚Äù

Boyd curled his lips back and made an open-mouthed hissing noise that might, in some alternate universe, have sounded scary ‚Ä¶ if he hadn‚Äôt been talking to someone descended from shapeshifting demons or smirking himself at the time.

As it was, Robbie curled both arms around Boyd‚Äôs left arm and rested his head on Boyd‚Äôs bicep. ‚ÄúYou know we love you.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes to the ceiling. ‚ÄúYeah, yeah.‚Äù

Robbie patted his forearm and stood up straight. ‚ÄúGood. So, which ones need bubble cases?‚Äù

He‚Äôd finished eighteen new pieces in total ‚Äî varnished and all ‚Äî but only twelve were for Dr Kearns. After the lecture about overworking himself and being denied the folder of new jobs, Boyd had been careful not to finish too many more from that list, which was why he shifted focus to Dr Kelly‚Äôs father, the viscount.

Including the two pieces waiting outside, he now had eleven of the forty-seven figures required. The original contract had been for thirty-one, but after the viscount saw the footage Dr Kelly sent him, he added eighteen more, along with a package of extra reference photos.

His cousin had reviewed the contract and vouched for it, promising him that the wording stated he would receive an additional one hundred and sixty thousand dollars for the extra figures.

Making the overall project just under half a million dollars ‚Ä¶ and he was already a fifth of the way through it. Ironically, once Boyd looked the photos over, he knew exactly where he would slot them in to make the overall piece seamless and agreed to the amended contract.

He selected two of the finished pieces to show Dr Kelly that the work was still progressing. He would keep them until they were all completed, of course, but it was good to show something in the meantime to prove the work was progressing.

After pulling out the fourteen finished pieces that he‚Äôd take with him, Robbie got to work.

1l5zoiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1l5zoiv/i_feel_invisible_in_my_own_home/,I feel invisible in my own home,"I (24f) still live with my parents in my childhood home. There's a lot that has happened in my entire life, but today really highlighted what I already thought. I'll give some context to things that have happened before today to give a better picture. Here it is:


‚óèEvery birthday or Christmas, they either give me socks, some sort of phone holder so you can watch videos while laying down, some form of back or foot massager, or they just get my dog something quick. There's nothing personal. They don't know what I like. They've never really made the effort. 
‚óèI get interrupted all the time when I'm telling stories or telling jokes. They don't apologize and if I stop talking after they interrupt, they don't ask what I was about to say
‚óèMy mom has a lot of anger issues and I feel like I can't talk to her about anything. It always gets twisted around to blame me and/or she gets mad at me for calling her out. 

That's some context that probably matters. I'm not sure. I'm so tired and hurt. Here's what happened today:

‚óèThey kept going on errands without even asking me if I wanted to go with. Someone has to stay home with my dog because she has really bad separation anxiety and it's just easier for someone to be home with her. My mom has complained about never going anywhere (but when I offer to let her go instead of me, she declines). They got coffee without letting me know and they said ""oh, sorry. We didn't even think to let you know. We can go now to get you something""
‚óèMy dad and I were at a hardware shop and I wanted to look at a new extension cord because one of mine is acting up. He said he didn't know if a 3 foot one would work so I asked if we wanted to wait until we could measure the distance in my room. I swear he only listened to every other word because he said ""well, I'm not in your room right now, so I can't measure""
‚óèI also told my dad that I wanted to get rid of my ceiling fan because I don't use it, I never really have. He said ""but at least you have the option."" I don't want the option; I don't need the option. He kept trying to sell me on either keeping my current fan (which I don't like and wasn't even the one to pick it out for my own room. It was my mom and she didn't even ask my opinion on it) or getting just a new ceiling fan. I kept repeating that I don't want the option. 

Anyways, I'm not sure if this is emotional neglect. I feel like it is, but I just needed to rant somewhere. I'm so tired of living in this house with people who only care because I'm related to them. ",1,1749343375.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

I'm in no way a professional photographer, but more of an enthusiast. What I truly love is that old-school aesthetic vintage cameras bring, turning even the most unremarkable landscapes into something special.

I already own a few film cameras, but that stuff can get quite expensive. And honestly, getting rolls developed is a pain in the ass. I always end up putting it off, sometimes for weeks, or forgetting about them entirely ‚Äî which means I don‚Äôt even get to see the half of my shots.

That‚Äôs what pushed me toward a compact digital.

I wouldn‚Äôt really call them ‚Äúvintage‚Äù ‚Äî I mean, they were around when I was a kid, and I‚Äôm not ancient yet ‚Äî but if you play around with the settings, you can still get some cool results.

The tricky part? Finding one that was affordable but not a complete piece of junk.

I‚Äôd nearly accepted the idea of breaking my budget when the listing appeared, like a gift from Heaven.

Fujifilm A220, 12.2 megapixels, used but in perfect condition. Fully functional, came with the cable, batteries, memory card ‚Äî the full package. And all for ten bucks.  
Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî I know what they say about deals that seem too good to be true.  
But I figured, worst-case scenario, I‚Äôd just wasted ten dollars. Money I‚Äôd have spent on cigarettes anyway. You could say I was investing in my own health.  
And if it turned out to be legit? Then I‚Äôd scored a real bargain.

I purchased it right away. Four days later, the camera was in my hands and hey, everything seemed fine, apart from a tiny, barely noticeable smudge on the sensor. That truly was a good deal.  
I took a few test shots around my living room, of my cat Coco, and even tried a couple of selfies with, let‚Äôs just say, less-than-flattering results. But for a proper run, I figured I‚Äôd wait until the next day ‚Äî mostly because, well, I have a bit of a laziness issue. I left the camera on my nightstand and went about my day.

In hindsight, that was the right call.  
That Saturday was beautiful ‚Äî clear, sunny skies. I live pretty close to a big amusement park, and it struck me as the perfect spot to snap some pictures in the late afternoon, right at the peak of golden hour, when light really does something magical.

I came back home feeling pretty pleased and rushed to upload the photos onto my computer.

That‚Äôs when I noticed something strange.

Between a shot of the Ferris wheel and my own awkwardly smiling face, was another photo.  
A photo that shouldn‚Äôt have been there.

It wasn‚Äôt a slip of the finger or some random blur.

It was the picture of a room ‚Äî a room I had never been in.

It looked like some sort of waiting room, the ones you‚Äôd find outside of a doctor‚Äôs office. It had pastel pink walls and a linoleum floor of similar color. Three plastic chairs were lined up on the left, while on the opposite side stood a dark blueish door and a potted indoor plant placed in the corner. The wall directly facing the camera was entirely taken up by a large window, looking out onto a pale gray sky. I checked the image details, hoping to find something that could explain how that picture ended up on my camera. What I saw only added to my confusion.

The photo seemed to have been taken at 2.34 am.

It made no sense. Suppose I *did* take the picture and then just forgot about it, how could I have done it in the middle of the night when that room appeared to be lit in broad daylight? Even if I had been sleepwalking, I seriously doubt I could‚Äôve wandered all the way to a medical office in another time-zone, snap a photo, and made it back to my bed, all before waking up at 10 am. this morning.

I turned to the Internet, wishing to find an answer, but to no avail. In the end, I resolved to do what I‚Äôd always done best: nothing at all.

Deep down, I was sure there was a rational explanation for what I‚Äôd seen ‚Äî I just hadn‚Äôt figured it out yet.  
The only thing I wanted was to distract myself, forget about it, and go to sleep. But I couldn‚Äôt.

You see, there was something about that whole absurd deal that wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone.

That place‚Ä¶ though I was positive I‚Äôd never been there, it felt familiar in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain.

‚ÄúOf course it feels familiar,‚Äù I snapped at myself. ‚ÄúThere are hundreds of thousands of rooms that look exactly like that. No reason to freak out about it.‚Äù

I repeated those last few words like a mantra, again and again, until they didn‚Äôt make any sense anymore, twisting and twirling in my head as I finally fell asleep.

On the next day, the sight of another second picture hit me like a gut punch.

If you were to ask me why I opened the gallery, I don‚Äôt think I could explain it. I had no reason to ‚Äî I hadn‚Äôt taken any new photos, and the ones from the previous day, including *that* one, were already on my computer.

Still, there was this strange, nagging feeling in my gut, telling me to look. I resisted for a while, tried to lose myself in my phone, in something on TV. But my thoughts kept circling back.

Eventually, I gave in.

You know that feeling you get when you‚Äôre expecting bad news? A failed exam, a rejection from a job, a message from someone you like, turning you down. You know it‚Äôs there, waiting for you, but you stall, not ready to look ‚Äî because the moment you do, well‚Ä¶ it becomes real. And yet, you can‚Äôt help it. Whether it‚Äôs hope, resignation or just the fact that, you know, you have to.

That was the feeling I had as I held the camera in my hands, powered it on, and opened the gallery.

And there it was.

Just like the first time, it was the photo of a room. Only now something was different. This time, I recognize the place right away. The brown sofa, the armchair, the coffee table and the TV. Next to them, the small desk with Dad‚Äôs computer.

That was the living room of the first apartment I grew up in.

An apartment that my parents sold when I was eleven to move into a bigger house, one where me and my sister wouldn‚Äôt have to share the same bedroom, an apartment I‚Äôve never set foot in since.

I needed to sit down. Sparking a cigarette, I realized my hands were trembling.  
Come on, there had to be a logical explanation for those photos. Right? But what?

Okay, maybe the waiting room one ‚Äî maybe I‚Äôd woken up at night, seen something similar on TV, and for some godforsaken reason taken a photo of the screen.  
But this?  
The living room from our old house, still filled with the furniture we brought with us when we moved?  
Was this some time-traveling shit? Wait, didn‚Äôt my pediatrician‚Äôs office have a room that looked just like that first picture?

No, I was losing my mind. ¬†

There had to be a reasonable explanation. I just needed to find it.

I transferred the image to my computer, determined to dig deeper.  
Unsurprisingly, the timestamp showed it had also been taken at night ‚Äî 3:02 a.m., to be exact.

Then I spotted something peculiar. On the far wall, between the two windows, was the framed piece of embroidery my mother had made: ‚ÄúGod bless this Home,‚Äù surrounded by little flowers.  
But something about it seemed off in the photo. I had to zoom in to be sure.

The words, they made no sense. It was just gibberish. Even the letters themselves looked strange, like they belonged to another alphabet, but somehow still quite familiar.

That was it. I‚Äôd had enough.  
The camera was clearly messed up ‚Äî what else could I expect for ten dollars?  
I slammed it into my nightstand drawer and told myself that was the end of it.  
I wouldn‚Äôt use it again. I wouldn‚Äôt let it mess with my head anymore.

¬†That night, I had a nightmare.

While most of the time my dreams would vanish as soon as I opened my eyes, this one still lingered, vivid and unsettling, when I woke up. In the dream, I was back to my middle-school years, sat in the classroom at my usual desk, second to last row, next to the window. It would have looked just like any other school days, except for the fact that the teacher was actually Frank Wilson, the senior manager from my office. Fixing his cold, dead-fish-eyes on me, Wilson asked: ‚ÄúIs that report ready?‚Äù Hearing that, a knot twisted in my middle-schooler stomach as I realized that I had no idea what report he was talking about. Trying to maintain some sort of composure, I started rummaging through my backpack, but all that I could find was a pencil case, an algebra book and a Power Rangers lunch box. ¬†¬†

‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm sorry, Mr. Wilson‚Äù, I stuttered, slowly rising from my desk, ‚ÄúI really need to use the bathroom now‚Äù. Without even waiting for a response I fled the classroom, running into the boy‚Äôs restroom, where I slammed the door behind me.

Inside, the bathroom was unexpectedly large, the size of a school gym, with its floor, walls and high ceiling covered in dull, dark green tiles. It was also almost completely empty; only in the far back right corner stood three stalls, with an equal number of sinks lined up beside them. In the opposite corner, a wide archway led to what seemed like another room of similar design, from which the only source of light was coming in. By that point, I knew I was no longer inside the school.

Although the room was absurdly big, I remember feeling, in the dream, an overwhelming sense of oppression. It felt like the space itself was shrinking slowly, not enough to be seen, but only felt. I stood frozen for a few seconds, uncertain of what to do. I can‚Äôt say whether the version of me in the dream truly needed to use the toilet, but I remember a deep instinct warning me not to get close to the stalls: if I did, something bad would happen.

Then I heard it. Steps. Coming from the other room. It's hard to explain now, but in the dream, I knew with certainty that whoever was about to enter the bathroom meant me harm. It must have happened all in a few seconds, but just like in every nightmare, those seconds stretched into eternity.

Aware of that presence, an unbearable dread surged through me, burrowing into my chest and stealing the air from my lungs. It wasn‚Äôt just fear I felt, but despair. Complete and paralyzing despair, pinning me in place like chains. The cries and screams that rose within me escaped my mouth only as broken, breathless gasps. Then, a shadow came through the archway, growing bigger and bigger.

It was coming.

The fear stuck with me for a couple of seconds, as I was opening my eyes in the pitch-black bedroom. I exhaled slowly and picked up my phone to check the time. It was 2:40 a.m.

‚ÄúScrew you, Wilson‚Äù I thought.

Right then, a doubt started to form. A ridiculous, pointless one. And yet the harder I tried to dismiss it, the stronger it grew, digging in until I couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore. I got out of bed, opened the nightstand drawer and grabbed the camera. Hesitated. Then opened the gallery.

Waiting for me, was a new picture. Maybe, if I try hard enough, I could somehow give you a vague idea of the sensations that overtook me upon seeing that image. But I‚Äôm afraid that, now, it‚Äôs not just words that fail me, but memory as well ‚Äî for all these emotions grew in me all at once, mixing, shifting, replacing each other so quickly that listing them all would be simply impossible. What left the deepest impression on me, however, was the sudden awareness that, somewhere in the far reaches of my mind, a fog had lifted. Something I must have always known‚Äîbut I was able to hide from myself‚Äîhad now come to light, made undeniable by the evidence right before my eyes.

Though the image was dark, even grainier than the others, it seemed to me clearer than ever: a large room, fully covered in dark green tiles, with three stalls and sinks far back on the right; on the left, an archway from which the light came. The photo was taken just a few minutes earlier.

It was taken from my dream.

I‚Äôve stopped trying to find a rational explanation.

Over the past few days, I‚Äôve gathered quite a collection of photographs: playgrounds, swimming pools, some places I know well, others that feel completely unfamiliar. Some I still remember when I wake up; others, it‚Äôs like seeing them for the first time.

But there‚Äôs one constant in every photo ‚Äî a dark, blurred shape. I first noticed it in the bathroom picture, though at the time I must have thought it was just that stain on the sensor.

It‚Äôs always there in my dreams too ‚Äî at least in the ones I can remember. Sometimes I can‚Äôt see it clearly, but I can feel it ‚Äî its presence heavy and threatening.

When I *do* see it, it‚Äôs nothing like the pictures. Not a blurry black shape, and yet I cannot find the words to describe it. It is fear ‚Äî raw, suffocating fear, the kind that leaves no way out.

And it‚Äôs getting closer. I see it, every day, always closer.

Soon, I won‚Äôt be able to wake up in time.

Perhaps, I should‚Äôve spent those ten bucks on cigarettes.

I should‚Äôve stuck to film.",2,1749343278.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Everywhere is here. Every moment in time is now. The mind is very powerful. Nothing exists if the mind doesn't comprehend it‚Äîwe have yet to evolve to this level of awareness; evolution.

Imagine this: you're sitting in a bustling caf√©, surrounded by the chatter of people and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. In this moment, this caf√© is your entire universe. Outside, the world moves on‚Äîcars zoom by, birds chirp in distant trees, waves crash against the shore. But for you, in the here and now, all that matters is the warmth of your cup between your hands and the soft hum of conversation around you. This caf√©, this exact moment, is your reality.

Our perception of reality is deeply intertwined with our consciousness. What we perceive, what we experience, exists within the confines of our minds. It's not just about physical space; it's about how we interpret and interact with the world around us. The concept that ""everywhere is here"" speaks to the idea that wherever we are, that place becomes our present reality. Our mind, through its perception and awareness, shapes our experience of the world.

Think about time. We often conceive of time as a linear progression‚Äîpast, present, future. Yet, in each moment we experience, the past and future collapse into the present. The past exists as memories, shaped by our perceptions and interpretations. The future exists as anticipation, influenced by our hopes and fears. Ultimately, all we truly have is now‚Äîthe perpetual present that stretches infinitely in every direction.

The power of the mind extends beyond mere perception. It delves into the realms of creation and understanding. Our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions shape not only our individual experiences but also the collective reality we share. Take, for instance, scientific discoveries or artistic creations‚Äîeach begins as an idea within someone's mind before manifesting into tangible form. The mind's ability to conceive of possibilities beyond immediate reality is a testament to its boundless potential.

Yet, despite our advancements, we're still uncovering the depths of human consciousness. Evolution isn't just physical; it's also cognitive and spiritual. As we learn more about ourselves and the universe, we expand our capacity to perceive and comprehend. Our journey toward greater awareness is ongoing, marked by discoveries that challenge and reshape our understanding of existence itself.

In conclusion, the interplay between perception, consciousness, and reality forms the core of our philosophical exploration. Everywhere we go, every moment we inhabit, is a testament to the power of our minds to shape our experience of the world. As we continue to evolve, both individually and collectively, we unravel new layers of understanding that redefine what it means to be truly aware.

We‚Äôre taking a huge financial risk that we believe is worth it in the long run. 

The reason I‚Äôm telling this pharmacy sub is you guys and gals need to take a real hard look at this profession, and how quickly it‚Äôs declined in the last decade or 2.  I‚Äôm only speaking of retail since that‚Äôs really all I know. Lots of words come to mind thinking about retail pharmacy, and I‚Äôm sure you each have your own.

Anyway, my main point here is if you have to make a move in your life/change jobs/careers, I‚Äôd seriously consider it. Whatever your passion is, make it happen.  Life is too short. I‚Äôd be a complete fool if I said don‚Äôt let money step in your way, since this profession does pay pretty well (compared to others). It‚Äôs what kept me going for so long, as I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same with a lot of you.

Your future self will thank you.

1l5zalu,https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/ufo-us-disinformation-45376f7e,The Pentagon Disinformation That Fueled America‚Äôs UFO Mythology,"A tiny Pentagon office had spent months investigating conspiracy theories about secret Washington UFO programs when it uncovered a shocking truth: At least one of those theories had been fueled by the Pentagon itself. 

The congressionally ordered probe took investigators back to the 1980s, when an Air Force colonel visited a bar near Area 51, a top-secret site in the Nevada desert. He gave the owner photos of what might be flying saucers. The photos went up on the walls, and into the local lore went the idea that the U.S. military was secretly testing recovered alien technology.

But the colonel was on a mission‚Äîof disinformation. The photos were doctored, the now-retired officer confessed to the Pentagon investigators in 2023. The whole exercise was a ruse to protect what was really going on at Area 51: The Air Force was using the site to develop top-secret stealth fighters, viewed as a critical edge against the Soviet Union. Military leaders were worried that the programs might get exposed if locals somehow glimpsed a test flight of, say, the F-117 stealth fighter, an aircraft that truly did look out of this world. Better that they believe it came from Andromeda.

This episode, reported now for the first time, was just one of a series of discoveries the Pentagon team made as it investigated decades of claims that Washington was hiding what it knew about extraterrestrial life. That effort culminated in a report, released last year by the Defense Department, that found allegations of a government coverup to be baseless.
In fact, a Wall Street Journal investigation reveals, the report itself amounted to a coverup‚Äîbut not in the way the UFO conspiracy industry would have people believe. The public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.

At the same time, the very nature of Pentagon operations‚Äîan opaque bureaucracy that kept secret programs embedded within secret programs, cloaked in cover stories‚Äîcreated fertile ground for the myths to spread.

These findings represent a stunning new twist in the story of America‚Äôs cultural obsession with UFOs. In the decades after a 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells‚Äô ‚ÄúThe War of the Worlds‚Äù spread panic throughout the country, speculation about alien visitors remained largely the province of supermarket tabloids, Hollywood blockbusters and costumed conferences in Las Vegas. 

More recently, things took an ominous turn when a handful of former Pentagon officials went public with allegations of a government program to exploit extraterrestrial technology and hide it from Americans. Those claims led to the Pentagon‚Äôs investigation.

Now, evidence is emerging that government efforts to propagate UFO mythology date back all the way to the 1950s. 

This account is based on interviews with two dozen current and former U.S. officials, scientists and military contractors involved in the inquiry, as well as thousands of pages of documents, recordings, emails and text messages. 

At times, as with the deception around Area 51, military officers spread false documents to create a smokescreen for real secret-weapons programs. In other cases, officials allowed UFO myths to take root in the interest of national security‚Äîfor instance, to prevent the Soviet Union from detecting vulnerabilities in the systems protecting nuclear installations. Stories tended to take on a life of their own, such as the three-decade journey of a purported piece of space metal that turned out to be nothing of the sort. And one long-running practice was more like a fraternity hazing ritual that spun wildly out of control.

Investigators are still trying to determine whether the spread of disinformation was the act of local commanders and officers or a more centralized, institutional program. 

The Pentagon omitted key facts in the public version of the 2024 report that could have helped put some UFO rumors to rest, both to protect classified secrets and to avoid embarrassment, the Journal investigation found. The Air Force in particular pushed to omit some details it believed could jeopardize secret programs and damage careers.

The lack of full transparency has only given more fuel to conspiracy theories. Members of Congress have formed a caucus, composed mainly of Republicans, to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP, in bureaucratic speak. The caucus has demanded the intelligence community disclose which agencies ‚Äúare involved with UAP crash retrieval programs.‚Äù

MAGA skepticism about the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù further feeds the notion that government bureaucrats have been keeping those secrets from the American public. At a November hearing of two House Oversight subcommittees, Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, cast doubt on the Pentagon‚Äôs report. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a mathematician, but I can tell you that doesn‚Äôt add up,‚Äù she said. 

‚ÄòStupid enough‚Äô


Sean Kirkpatrick, a precise, bespectacled scientist who once spent years studying vibrations in laser crystals, was nearing retirement from government service when he received the call that would change his life.

By 2022 he had ascended to chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center at the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala. As he sat at his desk at 6:30 one morning, drinking coffee and skimming through intelligence reports that had come in overnight, his Tandberg desk phone‚Äîessentially a classified version of FaceTime‚Äîrang. 

It was a deputy undersecretary from the Pentagon, who was putting on a tie as he told Kirkpatrick about a new office Congress ordered the department to set up to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena. ‚ÄúThe undersecretary and I put together a shortlist of who could do it, and you‚Äôre at the top,‚Äù the official relayed, adding that they had settled on Kirkpatrick because he both had a scientific background and had built a half-dozen organizations within the intelligence community.

Is that the real reason, Kirkpatrick countered, ‚Äúor am I the only one stupid enough to say, ‚Äòyes?‚Äô‚Äù

In short order, Kirkpatrick had the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office up and running. Just the latest in an alphabet soup of special government projects set up to study UFOs stretching back more than half a century, AARO, as it is known, operated out of an unmarked office near the Pentagon, with a few dozen staffers and a classified budget.

The mission fell into two buckets. One was to collect data on sightings, particularly around military installations, and assess whether they could be explained by earthly technology. Amid growing public attention, the number of such reports has skyrocketed in recent years, to 757 in the 12 months after May 2023 from 144 between 2004 to 2021. AARO linked most of the incidents to balloons, birds and the proliferation of drones cluttering the skies.

Many pilot accounts of floating orbs were actually reflections of the sun from Starlink satellites, investigators found. They are still examining whether some unexplained events could be foreign technology, such as Chinese aircraft using next-generation cloaking methods that distort their appearance.

The office found that some seemingly inexplicable events weren‚Äôt so strange after all. In one, a 2015 video appeared to show a spherical object buzzing past a jet fighter at an almost impossible speed. ‚ÄúOh, my gosh dude,‚Äù the pilot can be heard saying in the video, laughing. But later, investigators determined there was nothing much to see‚Äîwhatever the object was, the camera angle and relative speed of the jet had made it appear to be going much faster than it was.

The office‚Äôs second mission proved to be more peculiar: to review the historical record going back to 1945 to assess the claims made by dozens of former military employees that Washington operated a secret program to harvest alien technology. Congress granted the office unprecedented access to America‚Äôs most highly classified programs to allow Kirkpatrick‚Äôs team to run the stories to ground. 
As Kirkpatrick pursued his investigation, he started to uncover a hall of mirrors within the Pentagon, cloaked in official and nonofficial cover. On one level, the secrecy was understandable. The U.S., after all, had been locked in an existential battle with the Soviet Union for decades, each side determined to win the upper hand in the race for ever-more-exotic weapons. 

But Kirkpatrick soon discovered that some of the obsession with secrecy verged on the farcical. A former Air Force officer was visibly terrified when he told Kirkpatrick‚Äôs investigators that he had been briefed on a secret alien project decades earlier, and was warned that if he ever repeated the secret he could be jailed or executed. The claim would be repeated to investigators by other men who had never spoken of the matter, even with their spouses. 

It turned out the witnesses had been victims of a bizarre hazing ritual. 

For decades, certain new commanders of the Air Force‚Äôs most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer. The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering vehicle. 

The officers were told that the program they were joining, dubbed Yankee Blue, was part of an effort to reverse-engineer the technology on the craft. They were told never to mention it again. Many never learned it was fake. Kirkpatrick found the practice had begun decades before, and appeared to continue still. The defense secretary‚Äôs office sent a memo out across the service in the spring of 2023 ordering the practice to stop immediately, but the damage was done. 

Investigators are still trying to determine why officers had misled subordinates, whether as some type of loyalty test, a more deliberate attempt to deceive or something else.  

After that 2023 discovery, Kirkpatrick‚Äôs deputy briefed President Joe Biden‚Äôs director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, who was stunned.

Could this be the basis for the persistent belief that the U.S. has an alien program that we‚Äôve concealed from the American people? Haines wanted to know, according to people familiar with the matter. How extensive was it? she asked.  

The official responded: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, we know it went on for decades. We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of people. These men signed NDAs. They thought it was real.‚Äú

The finding could have been devastating to the Air Force. The service was particularly sensitive to the allegations of hazing and asked that AARO hold off on including the finding in the public report, even after Kirkpatrick had briefed lawmakers on the episode. Kirkpatrick retired before that report was finished and released.  

In a statement, a Defense Department spokeswoman acknowledged that AARO had uncovered evidence of fake classified program materials relating to extraterrestrials, and had briefed lawmakers and intelligence officials. The spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said the department didn‚Äôt include that information in its report last year because the investigation wasn‚Äôt completed, but expects to provide it in another report scheduled for later this year.

‚ÄúThe department is committed to releasing a second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include AARO‚Äôs findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,‚Äù Gough said.  

A bunker in Montana


Kirkpatrick investigated another mystery that stretched back 60 years. 

In 1967, Robert Salas, now 84, was an Air Force captain sitting in a walk-in closet-sized bunker, manning the controls of 10 nuclear missiles in Montana. 

He was prepared to launch apocalyptic strikes should Soviet Russia ever attack first, and got a call around 8 p.m. one night from the guard station above. A glowing reddish-orange oval was hovering over the front gate, Salas told Kirkpatrick‚Äôs investigators. The guards had their rifles drawn, pointed at the oval object appearing to float above the gate. A horn sounded in the bunker, signaling a problem with the control system: All 10 missiles were disabled. 

Salas soon learned a similar event occurred at other silos nearby. Were they under attack? Salas never got an answer. The next morning a helicopter was waiting to take Salas back to base. Once there he was ordered: Never discuss the incident. 

Salas was one of five men interviewed by Kirkpatrick‚Äôs team who witnessed such events in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s. While sworn to secrecy, the men began sharing their stories in the ‚Äô90s in books and documentaries. 

Kirkpatrick‚Äôs team dug into the story and discovered a terrestrial explanation. The barriers of concrete and steel surrounding America‚Äôs nuclear missiles were thick enough to give them a chance if hit first by a Soviet strike. But scientists at the time feared the intense storm of electromagnetic waves generated by a nuclear detonation might render the hardware needed to launch a counterstrike unusable. 


A model of an electromagnetic pulse testing site, shown in a 1978 Pentagon document.
To test this vulnerability, the Air Force developed an exotic electromagnetic generator that simulated this pulse of disruptive energy without the need to detonate a nuclear weapon.

When activated, this device, placed on a portable platform 60 feet above the facility, would gather power until it glowed, sometimes with a blinding orange light. It would then fire a burst of energy that could resemble lightning.


A 1973 Pentagon document diagrams a close-up of the part of the equipment that fires an electromagnetic wave that can appear like a bolt of lightning during the test.
The electromagnetic pulses snaked down cables connected to the bunker where launch commanders like Salas sat, disrupting the guidance systems, disabling the weapons and haunting the men to this day. 

But any public leak of the tests at the time would have allowed Russia to know that America‚Äôs nuclear arsenal could be disabled in a first strike. The witnesses were kept in the dark.

To this day Salas believes he was party to an intergalactic intervention to stop nuclear war which the government has tried to hide. He is half right. The experience left the octogenarian deeply skeptical of the U.S. military and its ability to tell the truth. ‚ÄúThere is a gigantic coverup, not only by the Air Force, but every other federal agency that has cognizance of this subject,‚Äù he said in an interview with the Journal. ‚ÄúWe were never briefed on the activities that were going on, the Air Force shut us out of any information.‚Äù

Concealing the truth from men like Salas and deliberate efforts to target the public with disinformation unleashed within the halls of the Pentagon itself a dangerous force, which would become almost unstoppable as decades passed. The paranoid mythology the U.S. military helped spread now has a hold over a growing number of its own senior officials who count themselves as believers.

The crisis grew to a boil over a piece of metal mailed to a late-night radio host in 1996, which the sender said they had been told was part of a crashed spaceship.

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm sincere in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I‚Äôm someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that‚Äôs both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one‚Äôs soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you ‚Äì not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

* Enjoy badminton (intermediate level‚Äîalways down for a casual hit)
* Also up for hikes, cafes, board games, or just good convos

If you know of any community events, rec leagues, or social groups, I‚Äôd be super grateful for the recommendations. And if you‚Äôre also looking to expand your circle or just want to hang out sometime, feel free to shoot me a message or drop a comment.

1l5yscl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l5yscl/i_took_the_wrong_subway_every_stop_is_worse_than/,I Took the Wrong Subway. Every Stop is Worse Than the Last.,"(1)

I‚Äôve always taken the subway.

That‚Äôs just how it goes for most people in New York City. Cars can drain your wallet, and it's not worth it for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt have cash to spare or the patience for the hassle of alternate-side parking. Having a car here feels less like a ticket to freedom and more like a burden. According to Google, about half the city‚Äôs residents feel the same way. Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not a bigger number. Just dealing with traffic can age you a decade. I‚Äôve watched cabs sit through a single red light cycle three times without budging an inch.

Of course, it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing and neatly folded newspapers. The MTA has its fair share of madness. Delays, reroutes, those mysterious ‚Äútrain traffic ahead‚Äù announcements, and the people. Not everyone is a problem. Most of us are just trying to get from point A to point B with our headphones in and our eyes down.¬†

But then there are the others, the quirky ones. The subway performers who treat the A train like it‚Äôs their stage at the Apollo. The cat-callers who think shouting a compliment across a crowded car is the way to someone‚Äôs heart. The folks sprawled across three seats, deep in slumber. And then there are the homeless, many quietly navigating life underground, blending into the scenery, while others make their presence felt in ways that are hard to overlook.

It‚Äôs a lot to take in. It can be overwhelming. It used to be for me.

I didn‚Äôt grow up here. My family moved to the city when I was seventeen, right in the middle of junior year. We came from a small town in Pennsylvania, the kind of place where doors are left unlocked and everyone waves, whether they know you or not. But my mom was ready for a change. She craved a fresh start, something bigger and louder than the quiet life we‚Äôd been living. I think the city was more of a distraction for her than anything else.

So we packed up what we could, sold off what we couldn‚Äôt, and ended up in a tiny, third-floor walk-up. That first year was a tough one. The city felt alive, like it had its own heartbeat, always bustling and demanding something from you. But as time went on, I started to find my rhythm. The clattering of the trains, the cadence of the announcements, and the way you begin to recognize familiar faces during your morning commute, even if you never exchange a word with them.

Now, the subway feels like a second home. A peculiar kind of sanctuary between my actual home. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs gritty, unpredictable, and can be downright frustrating at times, but it‚Äôs real. And in a city like this, sometimes that‚Äôs the best you can hope for.

Today felt like just another ordinary day.

I work one of those classic office jobs, you know the drill. Beige cubicles, flickering fluorescent lights, and coffee that tastes more like regret than anything remotely caffeinated. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind it. There‚Äôs a certain comfort in the routine. I‚Äôve never been the ‚Äúfollow your passion‚Äù type anyway.

¬†Passion seems like a luxury for those who don‚Äôt have to stress about rent, groceries, or whether their MetroCard has enough balance. For someone like me, a job that asks for exactly what I‚Äôm willing to give. nothing more, nothing less. Feels just right.

So, as usual, I clocked out after a long day, grabbed my well-worn suitcase, more of a work bag, really, but it‚Äôs taken enough hits to deserve the title, and threw on my coat. It was one of those early spring days when the weather can‚Äôt seem to decide what it wants to be. The sky was thick with clouds, but the air felt warm. I remember thinking I might have overdressed. Again.

The subway station was busier than usual. I could feel the day‚Äôs fatigue creeping in as I navigated through clusters of tourists clutching maps like they were trying to conjure a spirit. A group of them had gathered in front of the MetroCard machines, blissfully unaware they were blocking the entire entrance. I muttered an ‚Äúexcuse me,‚Äù knowing it would probably go unheard, and slipped past them with the quiet efficiency of someone who‚Äôs done this dance a thousand times.

I managed to find an empty spot on a bench, next to a guy who clearly was in the same predicament as me, just wanting to go home. He sat slouched over, tie loosened, eyes glazed in that universal post-9-to-5 stare. I pulled out my phone and started scrolling. News, social feeds, the same stream of curated distraction I‚Äôd scrolled through that morning. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Just the hypnotic flicker of blue light against my face.

The station hummed with a low mechanical groan, the kind that seeps into your bones if you stand still long enough. A saxophone echoed faintly from somewhere down the platform, its player hidden behind a row of pillars. The music was slow, mournful, something that might‚Äôve been soulful if not for the flat notes and tinny reverb.

The overhead lights flickered once, briefly, and I felt my eyelids droop. The kind of droop that comes not just from exhaustion, but from routine, bone-deep familiarity with a world that never quite changes. The same gum-stained tiles, the same peeling advertisements promising miracle diets and dubious lawyers, the same stale underground air tinged with hot metal and too many people in too small a space.

I blinked slowly. My phone sagged in my grip. Maybe it was the warmth of the tunnel, or the way the concrete seemed to hum in time with my heartbeat, but a fog started creeping in behind my eyes. A subtle pounding, dull but persistent, started at the base of my skull and worked its way forward. Not quite a migraine yet, but close. That hazy, unreal feeling where everything seems too far away or too close at once.

I shifted on the bench, adjusted the strap of my bag, and tried to focus on something, anything. A child across the platform was swinging his legs, counting tiles. An older woman tapped her cane rhythmically as if keeping time to some internal metronome. The train was late, of course.
My head dipped forward for just a moment. Or at least, I thought it was a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a start, heart thudding, phone sliding from my lap.

I quickly grabbed it before it could fall. My fingers wrapped around the phone just in time, its smooth surface slick with the sweat of my palm. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, letting my heart settle back into a more reasonable rhythm. The jolt had shaken off the last of my drowsiness, but something else had replaced it, an uneasy stillness. I glanced around, blinking hard.

The station was empty.

Startlingly, unnaturally empty.

The bench beside me, where the tired man had been sitting, was now vacant. The tourists, the child counting tiles, the old woman with the cane,gone. Every single person had vanished. No more quiet chatter, no more shuffling feet. The distant hum of the saxophone had stopped. Even the ever-present whoosh of air from passing tunnels was absent. The silence pressed against my ears like cotton, thick and disorienting.

My first thought was that I had fallen asleep for hours and missed the crowds, missed the rush. But that didn‚Äôt explain the silence. The subway never slept, not completely. There was always someone, always noise. Always something.

Confused, I moved to check the time on my phone. The screen stayed black. I pressed the power button once, twice, nothing. No buzz, no flicker. It was like the phone had simply died, or forgotten how to be a phone. I turned it over in my hands, wondering if the battery had given out. But it hadn‚Äôt felt like it was dying before I nodded off. And still‚Ä¶ It felt warm. Too warm.¬†

I sighed, my breath louder than it should‚Äôve been in the silent station, and slowly stood. The sound of my coat shifting, the scuff of my shoe against the platform, all echoed more than they should. My bag tugged at my shoulder as I adjusted it. The concrete underfoot suddenly felt less stable, like I was balancing on something too smooth, too polished to be part of a subway system that was never cleaned enough.

That‚Äôs when I heard it: the distant metallic screech of a train on the tracks, growing louder by the second. I turned toward the tunnel. Headlights cut through the darkness, spilling yellow beams that flickered as they passed over stray bits of trash and the tiled walls.

The train was slowing. Coming to a stop.

The front car hissed as it aligned with the platform, the doors sighing open in a mechanical exhale. I waited for someone to step out. No one did. No conductor visible. No passengers. The interior lights flickered, weak, sickly fluorescents that buzzed like an old ceiling fixture in a basement no one visited anymore.

I hesitated, my instincts buzzing now in a different way, telling me this didn‚Äôt make sense, that I should wait for the next one, that something about this was off. But logic took over. I told myself I‚Äôd simply take this train to my stop. Maybe this was one of those weird off-hours when everything just feels strange. Maybe there had been a power surge, and that‚Äôs why the phone was dead. Maybe I was just tired and overthinking it all.

I stepped closer, boots thudding softly against the concrete as I approached the open doors. They creaked apart slowly, like jaws easing open for a meal. Above the door, the flickering orange letters of the Destination Sign glowed through the gloom:

‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù

It scrolled, paused, then repeated.

‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù

I squinted at it, confused. The words were unfamiliar, clearly not English, but close enough to make me think I should know them. ‚ÄúSpanish?‚Äù I wondered. ‚ÄúItalian, maybe? Latin?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know. Whatever it was, it didn‚Äôt seem to be a station name, and definitely not one I recognized from the usual route.¬†

I shrugged to myself. I didn‚Äôt speak Spanish, at least, that‚Äôs what I assumed it was ,and besides, it didn‚Äôt matter. I was tired. I was cold. I just wanted to get home.

The doors finished opening with a heavy thunk that echoed down the empty station.

I stepped on.

The moment I crossed the threshold, a strange sensation washed over me, like I‚Äôd walked through a membrane of cold air, colder than the platform, almost like a refrigerated room. A shiver climbed my spine. I pulled my jacket tighter around me, trying not to look too long at the sterile glow of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Once again, the car was empty. Too empty. Not the lived-in kind of empty, not the kind that follows a morning rush or a late-night lull. This was something else. The seats were spotless, almost clinically so. The air was unmoving, stale but not from use, like it had been trapped in here for too long. Even the hum of the train's systems sounded muted, muffled somehow.

I picked a seat near the middle, my fingers gripping the plastic edge for balance. The cold seeped through my jacket, into my hands, into my bones. I let out a long breath, watching it fog slightly in front of my face.

I sat. I held my bag close.

I told myself this was just a weird delay, an alternate route, an old car maybe, something forgotten in the system but still functional. Nothing to worry about.

But my reflection in the window didn't seem convinced. The glass was too dark, too slow to catch up. I shifted slightly, and it lagged a fraction of a second behind, as though unsure whether to follow me at all.

The doors hissed shut behind me, sealing with an almost ceremonial finality. The train jolted forward, moving into the tunnel. No conductor‚Äôs voice came over the intercom. No rumbling announcement of the next stop.

Just that whisper of motion. That chill in the air.

And that sign, still blinking, still repeating, on the far end of the car:

‚ÄúLasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.‚Äù

I sat for a moment, hugging my coat tighter, the chill gnawing at my skin. The rhythmic clatter of the train against the tracks was the only sound now, a dull, mechanical heartbeat echoing through the car. I stared at the floor, at the speckled plastic between my boots, until something caught my eye outside the window.

Movement.

I turned my head slowly.

People.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, or my eyes playing games after the nap and the dim glow of the car. But no, it was unmistakable. Just outside the train, barely feet away, people were walking alongside it.

I gasped and bolted upright, pressing my face closer to the glass. The chill from the window stung my skin. The train hadn‚Äôt stopped ;¬† it was still moving, but so were they. A silent procession, keeping perfect pace. Dozens of them. Maybe more.

They walked not on a platform, but on something else, something dark and indistinct. The backdrop behind them was black, as if the tunnel had dissolved into a void. No walls, no lights, no signs. Just figures moving in lockstep with the train.

They didn‚Äôt look at me. They didn‚Äôt look at anything.

Their expressions were blank. Not peaceful, empty. Eyes open, unfocused. Mouths shut. No signs of communication, no hint that they even knew each other. Some were dressed in business suits, others in t-shirts, nightgowns, and uniforms. A teenager shuffled by wearing a backpack. An old woman in a house robe. A child with no shoes. A man in a soaked parka that dripped even though there was no rain.

No common thread, no reason, just people. All kinds of people.

And they were all walking in the same direction, right beside me, staring forward into nothing.

I felt my breath catch in my throat. My fingers trembled as they gripped the edge of the seat. I couldn‚Äôt look away. My brain raced to make sense of it. Some kind of art installation? A window to another train? A hallucination?

But they were too close. Too real. I could see the subtle sway of their steps, the twitch of a hand here, a loose thread blowing slightly there.

Finally, I sat back down, the seat creaking softly beneath me. I kept my eyes on the figures outside, watching them pass with that same slow, ghostlike pace. None of them looked back again. They just walked endlessly, obediently, as if drawn by some invisible tether. I don‚Äôt know how long I watched. Minutes? Hours? It felt like time had dissolved into the rhythm of the train and the hush of those blank faces drifting by.

Then, through the grime-streaked glass, a station emerged from the dark.

The train slowed, the brakes letting out a soft hiss like an exhale. The doors opened without a chime or announcement, just a quiet invitation. I stood, hesitating for a second. Then I stepped forward, drawn by something I couldn‚Äôt name. Maybe curiosity. Maybe instinct. Maybe the growing certainty that this was no ordinary ride home.

I clutched my bag tightly and stepped off.

The station was quiet. Too quiet.

Pale lighting flickered above, casting a soft ivory glow over every surface. There was classical music playing faintly, some string piece I couldn‚Äôt name, maybe Debussy or Satie,but it echoed as though it had been playing forever, looping in a forgotten corner of a dream. The acoustics were wrong. A fog dusted the floor, almost like dry ice had been hidden in the corner.¬†

The walls gleamed, tiles white as bone, without a smudge or crack. No stains, no ads torn halfway down, no gum under the benches. Even the trash bins were empty. It wasn‚Äôt just clean,it was sterile, like no one had ever truly been here. Or if they had, they‚Äôd been erased afterward.

And yet‚Ä¶ ads lined the far wall.

Not the usual ones for teeth whitening or discount lawyers. These were photographs, portraits. Faces I half-recognized. Not from life, but from dreams. From forgotten corners of sleep, from memories I could never fully place. One woman looked like a version of my second-grade teacher, but with green eyes and a crown of wheat. Another man reminded me of someone I once saw standing outside my apartment window at 2 a.m., ten years ago. I was certain I‚Äôd never seen these people in waking life, and yet there they were. Smiling. Still. Almost expectant.¬†

The brand names were vague, I wasn‚Äôt even sure if they were English. My eyes couldn‚Äôt focus enough on the logos to take in any details.¬†

Other passengers stood along the platform. At first, I thought they might board. But none of them moved. Some murmured to themselves. Others stood perfectly still, staring into space or fiddling with watches, pendants, and small objects clutched like charms. A few whispered phrases, fragmented riddles that made no sense.

‚ÄúThe river runs backward, and so do the clocks.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe never took the second stair.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne more stop, or none at all.‚Äù

Their voices didn‚Äôt carry. It was like they were underwater.

I stepped further in. My shoes made no sound on the tiled floor. No one acknowledged me. No one reacted. I might as well have been a ghost among ghosts. I looked for signs. Exit, Uptown, Transfer, anything. But there was nothing. Just the gleaming walls, the frozen faces, and that low, looping melody.

There were no stairs. No escalators. No elevators. Just this platform. Endless, perfect, and sealed. My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag. The train behind me remained at the platform, doors still open. Waiting.¬† I took a step farther from the train. The lights above flickered faintly, not enough to go dark, just enough to feel like they could. My footsteps made no sound.

I looked around again, slower this time.

A strange pressure began to build in my chest. A low, crawling sense of wrongness. I felt like I was walking too far into something I wouldn't know how to leave. Like the further I got from the train, the less of myself I was carrying with me. Amid the crowd, a face called to me. I froze, staring, heart thudding in my chest as I traced each familiar feature. I knew it was my brother.

But that was impossible.

He‚Äôd died before we ever came to New York.¬†
That fire had taken everything. It caught in the middle of the night, silent and sudden, and by the time help came, it was too late. The cause had never been determined. Just one of those tragedies people nod solemnly about and try to forget.

Our family didn‚Äôt forget. My mom certainly wouldn't. We left.

So how could he be here, now?¬†

I shook my head, trying to clear it, to ground myself in reality. It couldn‚Äôt have been him.

It couldn‚Äôt.

I turned back.

The open doors of the train looked different now, less inviting, more like a wound in the wall. A slit of light in a place that shouldn't have any. I hesitated. Then the whisper of a thought brushed through my mind, not mine, but carried on the edges of instinct:

This is the only way out.

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. Without another glance at the other passengers or the sterile walls, I stepped back onto the train.

As my foot crossed the threshold, a chill rushed over me. Colder than before. Deeper. Like stepping into the memory of winter. I sat down quickly, bag clutched tight in my lap, and tried not to look out the window. The doors slid shut behind me with a slow, deliberate hiss. The train began to move.

And as I settled into my seat again and the train lurched forward, a cold, cutting wind crept into the closed car. It had started as a draft, but only a thin trickle of air which tickled my neck. But it came, bulging in the course of a few moments into a wild, shrieking gust, as if the train had opened its veins to the world. Wind whipped down the aisle, tugging at my coat, messing strands of hair, icy on the sweat glued to my skin.

The wind shouldn't have been that strong. The windows weren‚Äôt open. The train was closed, air-conditioned to perfection like always. But this wind had a presence, there but not seen. I pulled myself into my coat, holding my bag as if it would ground me. Then, under the shriek of air, I heard something else. A whisper. But unmistakable.

It was my name.

I sat upright, my heart pounding in my chest. The whisper came again, so low I could barely pick it out, but as distinct as my thoughts. My name, sung through like an echo of a tunnel, spoken not with cruelty but with hunger.¬†

I looked around at the car, still empty. Quiet still, other than the wind and the pounding rhythm of the beat of my heart. Lights above flashed. Not loosely, electrically. But on purpose. As if the train itself was trembling. And then there was the deceleration of momentum. Slowly slowing down, passing on of inertia, the gentle pull in my stomach. The train was slowing once again.

Forward, the darkness broke apart to let in light. Not sterile white of a sanitized station. Not even the pale light of industrial halogens. This was rich, red light, alive, pulsating as if it were imbued with its heartbeat. It poured in through the windows in heavy waves, cloaking the inside of the train in a cave of crimson.

I stood up involuntarily, as if my body had decided something by itself. My legs pulled me toward the door, forced by some energy that did not entirely feel mine. The train came to a stop, and the doors slid open softly.

It wasn't a platform that stood there. 

In its stead, a nightclub spread out like an underground cave. Black marble-lined walls glowed with crimson veins of neon. The floor shone beneath your feet like melted glass. Each surface caught the light in unnerving, twisted fashions, as though the room was shifting, reforming itself constantly to remain just this side of graspable.

And the music, deep, beaty, sensual, thrashed in the air. It wasn't brash. It didn't have to be. It shook in your bones, slower than a beat but closer. As if the beat had always been in you, and now the world is mirroring it.

Bodies moved in the room, dancing stiffly with elegance. They were beautiful. Too beautiful. Each of them chiseled like a dream or a Vogue cover, but wrong in a way I couldn't understand. Their faces were smooth and expressionless, like porcelain masks with a forever grin. Eyes black and impossible deep. Their movement was hypnotic, smooth, as if they weren't dancing to the music but were the music. And most strangely, they were all naked.¬†

A stench of scent hit me. Perfume so potent it was bordering on rotten, the astringent tang of sweat, and something below that, metallic and irrevocable. Iron. I gagged, the smell remaining on the back of my throat like blood. And then the voices. Whispers in a dozen different timbres, interweaving the bass, curling around my ears like smoke.

""Come in,"" they whispered.

""We've been waiting.""

""You've always fantasized about this.""

""We know what you want.""

I ached to run. I ached to turn back. But my feet stayed rooted just beyond the train, drawn to heat, rhythm, weight of the air. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. One of the riders. A man I'd not even noticed until now. How did I not see him?¬†

He stood up from a bench on the inside of the train. A young man, dressed in business clothes, his tie loose, his eyes opened wide with awe. He spoke not a word, fought not. He simply walked ahead, moving as slowly as a somnambulist. He stepped off the train and onto the glowing dance floor.

The dancers shifted without missing a beat. They didn't stop, didn't blink. They shifted, making space for him with an inhuman fluidity. They found him, every one of them, and he stood still in the middle of their circle.

He stopped. Then smiled. Not a happy smile. Not even a relief smile. It was empty. Like something inside him had been removed. The dancers closed in around him. And I heard the scream.

It didn't come from the crowd. It came from the wall.

I approached the noise and saw an enormous mirror hung on a gold frame, radiating faintly with the same red light that filled the room. And within this mirror, the young man was pushed up against the glass from within. His mouth was agape, screaming, but he was making no sound. His hands clawed the glass. His eyes were wild, desperate, frightened. The scene behind him was chaos. A twisted, true version of the lounge beyond the flashy red lights. The other patrons inside the mirror were screaming, thrown about by invisible winds. Everything within that reflection was warped, violent, and wrong.

Behind him, the dancers moved in step. As if nothing had occurred. As if he had never lived at all. The mirror pulsed. The whispers returned, louder now, piling and insisting:

""You don't choose what you want.""

""The want chooses you.""

I stepped back. My boot caught on the lip of the train door. The dancers adjusted in my direction,just a little. Just enough. Enough for me. I launched myself back aboard the train. My breath caught as the doors slammed shut. The train groaned and began to move again, dragging me from the red light, from the mirror, from the scream that still echoed inside my chest.

I fell into the chair, my heart pounding. The gust of wind returned, almost soft. The way fingers combed my hair. But the scent lingered. Perfume. Sweat. Iron.

I was disoriented and immensely confused. Where the hell was I?

This had to be a dream. Some kind of break from reality. A crack in the smooth surface of sanity. I‚Äôd read about astral projection before, back when I was dabbling in all that witchy stuff. crystals, herbs, and protection spells. I‚Äôd gotten into it for a while after I first moved to New York, just enough to recognize the signs. That had to be what this was. A lucid dream. Maybe an episode. Something my brain was doing to cope. I had to be under too much pressure.

Everything had been unraveling lately. Bills are piling up. The weird tension between me and everyone I cared about. And with the third anniversary of my mom‚Äôs suicide coming up next week... maybe that was the trigger. Grief had a way of slipping back into your life like smoke under a door, unnoticed until you couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I looked around, trying to orient myself. Fluorescent lights buzzed above me like angry insects. The walls of the subway car pulsed in a dull, metallic gray, a sterile cage on wheels. I pinched my skin hard. Nothing. So I slapped myself across the face. The sound cracked the silence, and my cheek flushed pink where the impact landed. It didn‚Äôt hurt, exactly. More like a shimmer, a tingle. Almost like when a limb falls asleep, pins and needles, but warmer. Buzzing, alive.

When returning to your body after astral projection, you usually just find your resting place and slip back in. But I didn‚Äôt feel like a floating soul. I felt dense. Solid. The seat under me was hard. The air tasted faintly of rust and electricity. My skin felt too real, too intact. Could you still feel your heartbeat during astral projection?

I stared at my hands, no glow, no transparency. Just flesh and bone and chipped nail polish. I flexed my fingers. Still me. Still trapped. Maybe if I stayed on this train, let it take me wherever it was going, I‚Äôd find my way back. The idea felt like a rope I could hold onto. So I held onto it. I chose to believe it.

I leaned back into the seat. The clack-clack-clack of the wheels echoed in my ears, the sound oddly soothing. Outside the window, tunnels rushed past in flickers of shadow and gold, overhead lights strobing through the darkness like nervous thoughts. The rhythm of the train pressed itself into my bones, the gentle sway creating an almost meditative lull. Almost peaceful.

The next stop came into view.

I leaned toward the window, squinting into the strange light ahead. It wasn‚Äôt a station. It was a food court. The train slowed, the rhythmic clacking becoming a groaning crawl. I felt the brakes shudder beneath me, and once again, as they had before, the doors slid open with that same exhale of air, mechanical and tired.

The food court stretched out around me, impossibly wide, far larger than it could be. It curved in on itself in strange, repeating angles, like I‚Äôd stepped into a place that had forgotten how to end. Everywhere I turned, the same pale tiles, the same buzzing lights overhead. The hum in the air wasn‚Äôt just sound; it was pressure, like the building was breathing around me. Holding something in.

The counters were still stocked. Endlessly, violently stocked. Trays of meat were piled high, slick with a sheen that caught the light too well. Some pieces pulsed faintly, as if remembering what it was to live. There were pastries, too many, bursting at their seams with gelatinous fillings that leaked in slow, sticky drips down their sides. The smell was sugar and rot, warm and sickly sweet. They looked like they‚Äôd been decaying for days, and yet were always just set out.

And then there was the sludge. Piles of it in steel trays, bubbling softly. Brown, green, gray, none of it resembling food. It steamed endlessly, like it was being cooked by the building itself. The ladles stood stiff in the mounds, handles glistening, untouched but never quite clean. Every time I looked away and back again, the trays had been refilled. Nothing was ever gone. Nothing ever changed.

Except for them.

The patrons.

They were scattered across the tables, if you could call them people. Bloated, distended, half-fused to their chairs. Some looked stretched thin, like their skin had forgotten how to hold shape. Others had grown around the metal frames, flesh bulging between the bars of their seats like rising dough. Their eyes were cloudy, mouths slack. One man chewed endlessly at something I couldn‚Äôt see. A woman held a fork midair, never lifting it to her mouth, never lowering it. Just frozen in the act. Like they were all trapped in some looping performance of hunger.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if they were alive. I told myself not to look too long. But I did. One turned toward me. Just slightly. The skin at her neck cracked when she moved. Then, she returned to eating.¬†

The lights overhead buzzed louder. The menus on the stalls flickered, showing food that didn‚Äôt exist. A cheeseburger with teeth. A milkshake that twitched. I kept walking, trying to find an edge, an exit, even a dead end. But the layout looped, warped. Every turn brought me back to the same corner. The sludge. The meat. The figures are in their seats.

‚ÄúFree me,‚Äù a voice called.

That stopped me in my tracks, the first human voice I‚Äôd heard since I boarded the train. A man slumped in a steel chair, grotesque and bloated. His flesh spilled over the sides like melted wax, glistening with sweat. His face, barely recognizable as human, quivered as he sobbed, yet his hands kept working, shoveling gray, unidentifiable slop from a tray into his mouth. Like he had no choice.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, stepping closer. My voice sounded small, unsure. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he rasped, not looking at me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take it anymore.‚Äù

Suddenly, a speaker overhead crackled to life, sharp and cold. ‚ÄúConsumption is nourishment. You will be full.‚Äù The words echoed through the food court, sterile and inhuman.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said, but I didn‚Äôt know what I meant. I was sorry he was like this. I was sorry I couldn‚Äôt help. I was sorry I had come. He turned his swollen face toward me. For a moment, something real flickered in his eyes. ‚ÄúI just want to go home,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt was too soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was?‚Äù I asked. He opened his mouth, as if to answer, but the announcement cut in again. ‚ÄúConsumption is nourishment. You will be full.‚Äù

The effect was instant. Like a switch had been flipped. The man turned away. His expression went slack. The tears stopped. The shoveling resumed, mechanical and precise. The hunger was still there, but it no longer belonged to him. I stood frozen, heart pounding, watching him eat. His eyes no longer saw me. He was already gone.¬†

I turned to head back to the train when a terrible scream tore through the air behind me. It wasn‚Äôt just loud, it was raw, like something being ripped apart from the inside out.

I spun around. The sound came from the woman, the one who had looked at me earlier. Her eyes were wide, wild with terror. Her body jerked violently as she was dragged backward, not by hands or machinery, but by something invisible. There were no ropes, no figures. Just an unseen force pulling her toward a dark doorway at the back of the food court.

She screamed all the way in. Then, silence. Moments passed. Just when I thought I might step forward, she reappeared.

She walked slowly, mechanically, and sat back down in her seat as if nothing had happened. But she looked‚Ä¶ smaller. The grotesque layers of flesh she‚Äôd worn before were mostly gone now, stripped away as if something had peeled her like fruit. Her eyes were hollow. Her limbs moved like they were no longer hers.

As soon as she sat, more trays of slop were delivered across the food court. The other patrons began to eat again, more eagerly now, like she had somehow replenished them. It hit me all at once: she had. She‚Äôd been used. Fed into whatever machine powered this place, only to be returned diminished, but not free. Never free.

I backed away slowly, the air feeling heavier with each breath. Then I turned and stepped back onto the train. As the doors sealed behind me, I cast one last glance at the food court. I felt something close to pity for the patrons, the sad, swollen husks that slumped in their chairs, but the feeling rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt people anymore. They couldn‚Äôt be. Whatever they had been was long gone.

This whole cycle,getting off at these stops, walking through the corridors, watching things fall apart,it all seemed strange now. Pointless. Like I was just one more cog in something ancient and uncaring. I sank into my seat, eyes forward, letting the soft rattle of the train lull me into stillness. The lights flickered overhead. The wheels groaned.¬†

1l5yqxj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5yqxj,I found genuine gnc/genderqueer straight media :),"Hi guys, I was feeling desperate for representation, so I dug around the internet for a while and found 2 shows. I‚Äôm here to spread the good news! 

They are both genuine mascxmasc gncstraight relationships (Genuine as in it‚Äôs not played off as a joke or anything like that).

The first show is Young Americans. It is a spinoff of Dawson‚Äôs Creek and was made in 2000. It has a side story that includes a gncstraight romance. The characters involved are Hamilton and Jake. It unfortunately, only has 8 episodes, but I still throughly enjoyed it!
You can find the show on Dailymotion. 

The second series is Coffee Prince. It‚Äôs a kdrama that was made in 2007. The relationship is between the main character and her boss. This show can be found on Kocowa and viki.

Both shows, have the gnchet women go undercover as guys for the plot, but both of the characters are actually gnchet. (Ex. Jake is uncomfortable with being treated like a woman and has a gnc view of her relationship and sexuality. Ko Eun Chan (the kdrama main protagonist) was always masc. Eun Chan even stated that people in school would always call her a boy and girls would give her chocolates on Valentine‚Äôs Day).

I hope you guys enjoy the shows. We don‚Äôt get bones to chew on for representation, so I‚Äôm glad I found even a drop of media!",2,1749340458.0,genderqueerstraight,0,1.0,False

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in what many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to have met people to exchange with, and I'd like to see if I can find that again.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal*.

I do have a preference for cultural exchange, in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being *letters and items*. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. That being said, I'm increasingly interested in having *e-mail penpals*, which I'd be more open to in the immediate now.

There's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests to what makes someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. Honestly striving to embrace and integrate the more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them, is an attractive ideal of mine. I want people who show up as their real, authentic, messy selves, with a gaze that's elevated towards something majestic.

*Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the material is essential for me.* I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive splendor. People who are genuinely weird and different are inherently interesting to me. I long for someone who can mirror me back, but sometimes a person with a wholly different perspective and axiom can see and mesh with you best. I peak with ideation and whimsy, desiring compatibility over a clone, and seek out others who do as well.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. What does that mean? I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me, and I appreciate and admire many different types and expressions of it.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from chats to lengthy letters, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it as time goes on.

1l5ylao,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5ylao/is_my_partner_nitpicking_at_me/,Is my partner nitpicking at me?,"It's a series of small interactions which make me increasingly question if  I (26F) am being sensitive/rigid or if he (30m) is being controlling about my behaviour.

The lastest instance was when my partner was at the shops picking up groceries and snacks whilst I was at home. Over the phone, he pointed out that woolies had an apple turnover in stock which i wanted earlier in the week (bcus of period cravings) and then continued the rest of the shopping. 

He came home and to my surprise he didn't get me the apple turnover. His reasoning was: ""that I have been doing so well with avoiding sugar"" and that he was ""saving me"".... his logic doesnt make any sense though because he had also bought me a bottle of wine, which I didn't even ask for. If he was genuinely concerned for my health, wouldn't he also avoid getting the wine? 
I barely get snacks for myself, always for him. When he gets snacks, he always get significantly more for himself than what he gets me (if any) My sweets/snacks last for a week or few, compared to him eating his within the night.
Im considered skinny by most, and I usually eat pretty clean food otherwise.

Another instance is when I am doing things not the effecient way. There are many moments like this, but one of them is about the coffee grinds. We grind our coffee and put it in a jar. When im feeling lazy, I don't put it in the jar straight away (It is tedious to do) and I just scoop the coffee out of the grinder to put it in the percolator first and put the rest of the coffee in the jar later.
He has pulled me up on it a few times, knowing why I do it and that I usually do it the proper way.

He does this with many other things, questioning and trying to correct me when he also does the same things the lazy way!

He always makes comments about how im taking too long, but will also do something that makes whatever we are doing longer e.g: cooking, getting dressed, getting ready for a shower, shopping ect... 
If anything, he usually takes longer because of his time blindness & im usually pretty aware of how long i am taking, unless I am overstimulated.
I also am pretty patient with him when he takes his time due to his ADHD 

He also complains when I do shopping or run errands on my own when he is at work. 
I dont drive, so it takes abit longer but but it only takes 8-15minutes one way when going to the shops & am usually pretty quick inside. He says we can go together on the weekend or when he's finished with work, but sometimes I need to get the groceries/run errands before he is free (I cook breakfast, dinner and usually lunch for us everday, feed the cat & dog I do 95% of the shopping, delivery for big shops &  I keep track of we need/want)

I also have to explain in detail to him why I dont want sex. He can never accept a simply ""no, I don't feel like it. We have sex nearly EVERDAY because of his sex drive. He is completely aware majority of the time I do not want sex & keep up with him to keep him satisified. It's so frustrating, because even on my period I have to explain to him why I dont want to do anything as he just conveniently forgets how I feel when im on my period. 
My period is the only time I look forward to not having sex with a justified reason, yet he still gets upset and expects sex from me 

I have to explain to him why I am doing something a certain way with things, especially when I cook. He then he proceeds to tell me how to do it differently. He rarely helps with cooking, deciding what to eat and never takes the lead in that aspect. So I feel really disrespected when he questions me and tells me what to do (he also knows only how to cook basic stuff).... 

Last night, he also commented about how i didn't help him bring the groceries in. Thing is, I was unaware he came home because the family room door was shut whilst I was chatting with a housemate, and he brought both bags in at once. Funny thing is, he watches me bring in multiple bags of groceries when we have a delivery and never helps me. 

He says I never accept help, never listen to him and am stuck in my ways (there are so many things I compromise on to make our relationship work and make him happy) he also gets upset at me when I dont ask him for help!! Such as cleaning up dishes. Which i don't think I should have to ask because everyone contributes to it and is a communal mess!

Tl;DR, My partner is controlling what I consume, is complaining about my behaviour that he does, questioning why I am doing things to then tell me how to do it differently, also pushing my boundaries. Is this behaviour really from a place of concern and curiosity, or is he nitpicking at me ???

I was in dog sports for a long time growing up - like you see on Westminster dog show (the ""dog beauty pageant equivalent""). When I was young I always wanted the dog to ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO ME, even if it was happily staring off into middle space, or the hot dog cart nearby or whatever. Not wiggling, standing nicely, just not looking at me (AKA ""freestack""). 

I have a three year old son. He is high, high energy and I feel like a full on cruise director with this kid üò≠. He will literally wake up in the morning and ask ""what activity are we doing today?"" I work full time. Toddlers are nuts. 

Lately I've been embracing ""the free stack"". Basically, if something is keeping his attention and he is not in danger, I am letting it ride. I no longer care if he is paying attention to me or doing the activity I lovingly set out. You do you dude. Example: he was dying to help me do the dishes. He scrubbed a pan for twenty minutes. I emptied the dishwasher and had a hot cup of coffee. Boom. 

I know this isn't revolutionary or anything but it's been huge for me with a Velcro toddler who cannot play independently well. 

May the odds be ever in your favor ‚úåÔ∏è.

Link to original post below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/s/9hgrgQiYmb

So, it‚Äôs been a year lol and dating in Sacramento is very difficult. After many first dates, being ghosted, and being lied to, I feel like throwing in the towel. But I am NOT giving up! I am hopeful that the right person for me is out there.üôÇ

Some things I‚Äôve learned since being home and dating in Sac:
- Be clear with your wants/needs, boundaries. People will try to push them or omit certain information so they seem more appealing to you.
Most recently, I had a guy that I was talking to circle back my way because the woman he wanted to pursue things with wasn‚Äôt honest with him about her situation involving an ex. I was open to seeing him because we had a nice rapport. I recently texted him how his weekend was and he responded that he was with his daughter so he was having a good time. Then he said he understands if it‚Äôs a deal breaker for me. Jaw immediately dropped to the floor. I do not want children nor do I want to date people with children. This is on my profile clear as day. You know what wasn‚Äôt on his profile‚Ä¶ that he had a child lol. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è When this happened I literally laughed out loud. I cannot make this shit up lol. I was like that‚Äôs a big thing to leave off of your profile. That‚Äôs a dealbreaker for me. I ended up blocking him and moving on. But I do wonder how long he was going to keep that from me? I wouldn‚Äôt have swiped right if I knew that. I don‚Äôt put myself in situations where I know our fundamentals don‚Äôt match up. 

- Take a break if you are frustrated or feeling overwhelmed.

I have definitely taken lots of breaks when I am feeling frustrated by people‚Äôs non response or ghosting. My aim while dating is to be in a positive and open space and when I feel myself getting annoyed that‚Äôs when I know it is time to take a break. I don‚Äôt want to lead with negativity or a woe is me demeanor. So, take breaks they are really helpful!


- Don‚Äôt be afraid to go out by yourself.
I go to coffee shops, karaoke, paint and wine nights, walks etc by myself! You meet so many wonderful people. And they might have friends who are single! Recently, I met a wonderful tennis group because I was on a walk and saw people playing tennis and asked if I could join sometime. And they said yes! Now, I play three times a week when it was zero prior. Putting yourself out there isn‚Äôt just regulated to dating it‚Äôs in your everyday life as well!:)

- Stay positive and live your life.
This is a numbers game! When I am in the zone of my life and I am enjoying it that‚Äôs when I really shine and thrive. When I am not overthinking every little thing or in the space of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù that‚Äôs when the blessings come my way. I always try to find pockets of joy when I am feeling bummed about not meeting anyone yet. I literally write out all the things I am grateful for and that helps put things into perspective. I have a really great life and I‚Äôm looking to share it with someone. I know‚Ä¶ so cliche. I‚Äôm gonna go throw up now.  üòÇ  But seriously, be kind to yourself. We are all trying to find where we belong and who we belong with in this life. 

That‚Äôs all:)

Also, I‚Äôm doing this speed dating event on the 12th of June if anybody wants to meet me there! I‚Äôll be the black girl with braids, glasses, and a cute lil jumpsuit:)

# Best Cup Holders for Coffee Cups 2025: Reviews & Guide

the humble cup holder, often overlooked, plays a vital role in our daily lives, especially for coffee enthusiasts. A reliable cup holder prevents spills, keeps beverages within easy reach, and contributes to a safer and more enjoyable experience, whether in a car, at a desk, or on the go. As we move into 2025, innovative designs and materials are pushing the boundaries of what a cup holder can be. This guide explores some of the best cup holders for coffee cups available, providing insights into their features, benefits, and suitability for various needs.

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right cup holder involves considering several critical features that impact its functionality and usability.

**Worldwide Fit Design:** A primary consideration is the cup holder's ability to accommodate various cup sizes and shapes.

Universal fit designs typically incorporate adjustable arms, flexible inserts, or expandable bases to securely hold everything from small espresso cups to larger travel mugs. The ideal cup holder offers a snug fit that prevents wobbling and spills, irrespective of the cup's dimensions. Some models feature spring-loaded mechanisms or ratcheting systems that automatically adjust to the cup's diameter, ensuring a stable and secure grip. Premium materials like silicone or rubber lining further enhance grip and prevent scratches on delicate cups.

**Durable Construction:** The materials used in a cup holder's construction significantly influence its longevity and resistance to wear and tear.High-quality materials like ABS plastic, stainless steel, and impact-resistant polymers offer superior durability compared to cheaper alternatives.Stainless steel cup holders are particularly resistant to corrosion and can withstand exposure to moisture and extreme temperatures. ABS plastic provides a good balance of durability and affordability, while impact-resistant polymers offer exceptional strength and shatter resistance. The choice of material should reflect the cup holder's intended use and the environmental conditions it will be exposed to.

**Easy Installation:** The ease with which a cup holder can be installed and secured is a crucial factor, especially for portable or vehicle-mounted models.

Many cup holders utilize simple clamp-on designs,adhesive mounts,or expandable bases that require no tools for installation. Clamp-on models typically feature adjustable screws or levers that allow them to be securely attached to desks, tables, or car consoles. adhesive mounts offer a more permanent solution but require careful surface planning for optimal adhesion. Expandable bases, commonly found in car cup holders, provide a snug fit within existing cup holder slots.Quick and straightforward installation minimizes hassle and ensures the cup holder is ready for immediate use.

**Spill-Proof Design:** Preventing spills is a basic function of any good cup holder.

Spill-proof designs incorporate features like deep wells, raised edges, and secure locking mechanisms to contain accidental spills and prevent them from spreading.Deep wells provide ample space to catch spilled liquids, while raised edges act as a barrier to prevent liquids from overflowing. Some cup holders feature locking mechanisms that secure the cup in place, minimizing the risk of spills caused by sudden movements or bumps. Integrated drain holes allow for easy cleanup of any spilled liquids, further enhancing the spill-proof design.

**Insulated properties:** Some premium cup holders offer insulated properties to help maintain the temperature of beverages.

Insulated cup holders typically utilize double-walled construction with a vacuum-sealed air gap or insulating foam to minimize heat transfer. This helps keep hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold for extended periods. Stainless steel or aluminum are common materials used in insulated cup holders, as they offer excellent thermal conductivity and durability. Insulated properties are particularly beneficial for commuters who want to enjoy their coffee at the optimal temperature throughout their journey.

**What types of surfaces can adhesive cup holders be mounted on?**
Adhesive cup holders are generally suitable for smooth, non-porous surfaces such as glass, metal, plastic, and finished wood.

**How do I clean a cup holder that has spilled coffee in it?**
For removable cup holders, simply detach them and wash them with soap and water. For non-removable cup holders, use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe away the spilled coffee. Use a mild detergent if necesary. for stubborn stains, try using a solution of baking soda and water. Rinse thoroughly and allow to dry fully before using.**Can cup holders damage the interior of my car?**
Yes, poorly designed or improperly installed cup holders can potentially damage the interior of your car. For example, clamp-on models can scratch or dent dashboards or consoles if not properly padded or tightened. Adhesive mounts can leave residue or damage the surface when removed.

So, anyways, i work at a family company in a city that's not my own, i've been here since last year, i started living in a house the company is paying, first with several cousins (a nightmare) and later alone at the same house, living with me is difficult.

Last week one female cousin decided to return to the house, i was uncomfortable because i really don't get well with her, but wtf, i said to myself ""is only until i finish remodeling the house i bought"", two days ago i came at night and found the house with vigilance cameras in the inside, my broom in the backyard with her dog, the trash can in the left side instead of the right, my pot of coffee empty (i always make coffee for three or four days), the bags in a different drawer, all the lights turned on, the hose in the backyard (i always have the hose in the front because i like to wash my car) and i'm really really mad at her. I was trying to sleep yesterday and could not because i was hearing all her steps in the down floor, when i'm outside my room i'm using a hoodie and when i eat i sit on the floor behind a counter because i don't want the cams recording me, at the same time i'm trying hard not to fall into a lot of stuff i do like always touching five or six times the kitchen after i turn it off, or hitting the lock with my keys several times after i close the door, or i sit in a chair to smoke but now i can't because i feel like i'm being watched.

What makes me more angry is that she always say ""i know you have your touch"", sorry, english is not my native language, if you people don't get it, is a way to say i have something different, but she's still doesn't care, a few months back we where in a meeting about some reestructuring and one partner talked about not firing the ""special guy"" and i answered ""yes, i know, the autistic cashier"", and she started criticizing me for how i said it because the partner started crying while saying ""i know you didn't said that with bad intentions because you are like that too"" but.. ahhh, she doesn't care, she talks sh**** about how she's much nicer than me, and she smiles, and she have good manners, and then she starts about how she's sad because i don't talk to her, about how she loves me but i put distance between us, about how i dont let her touch me or hug me, and is because that, because she doesn't get it.

Anyways, i'm ranting, i already talked to my agent to search for an apartment to move, i hope to move away next week, i just need to talk but when i try people don't really understand, and i'm melting right now.",8,1749338371.0,autism,1,0.91,False

1l5xyab,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1l5xyab/fiestaware_fun_and_for_life/,Fiestaware - Fun and for Life,"I‚Äôm at 3 years now with my Fiestaware. I abuse the heck out of them leaving them in the sink for quite a while at a time with food and water and they‚Äôve held up excellently! 

I chose Lapis as my color of choice and they look just as good as they say I bought them. I love having them on display. I grew up with white Corelle, which is also BIFL, but is so boring and bland. Stoneware will break easier if you drop it compared to Corelle but I‚Äôve never dropped or broken a plate so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Fiestaware also has nice accents and textures on their dinnerware that classes them up a bit as well!

I decided to go with just one color since I‚Äôm going for a blue theme in my kitchen. Every time I eat on them they make me happy with their awesome color. It‚Äôd be fun to have a mix as well. I highly recommend going in person to Macys/Dillards/Kohls to make sure the color is what you‚Äôre after!

My recommendations:
- Bistro 3 piece set: The large plate, small plate, and small but deep bowl all get their uses. Small plates for just a burrito. The large plate for dinner. The deep bistro bowl for small bowls of cereal and salad. I definitely reach for all three for their own uses. Don‚Äôt get the classic rim bowl. It‚Äôs way too shallow.

- Gusto Bowl: I like having bigger bowls as well. I worried that it might be redundant having two sets of bowls but I use the small ones for smaller sides and eats, while the big gusto bowls are great for large salads, soups, and chilli. A can of soup will fit the gusto bowl perfectly but will overflow the bistro bowls. If you had to choose to save some money, then go with Gusto over the bistro bowl for sure. 

- Mugs - I got the 16oz bistro mugs. These have been perfect. I always want at least that much water/soda/coffee, so I highly recommend going big. Looks like the 16oz bistro mug got temporarily discontinued, so maybe look at the 16oz stackable mugs, but definitely go at least 16oz in my opinion. 

All in all, I highly recommend Fiestaware. It‚Äôs pricey but the color and quality are worth it. It‚Äôs made in America which is also nice as well!

As far as buying goes, always shoot for a sale. Black Friday I think usually has sales but I‚Äôm always seeing various sales throughout the year. What sparked me writing this review was a 30% sale at Macys that also applies to Fiestaware, so if you‚Äôre in the market this is a great time. Fiestaware also is running 15% off on their factory direct site if you need a piece that Macys doesn‚Äôt offer. So if you‚Äôre reading this in the future, shoot for a 15%-30% sale. 

Here‚Äôs the link: https://www.macys.com/shop/product/fiesta-bistro-coupe-12-piece-dinnerware-set-service-for-4?ID=16941389

I have no relation to Fiesta or Macys. I just really enjoy their products and want to support a company making quality and fun products. I bought all of my pieces myself (with a discount of course üòâ).

1l5xy8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l5xy8b/aita_for_wanting_to_cut_ties_with_my_parents/,AITA for wanting to cut ties with my parents before my wedding?,"I 38m, am getting married in six months to my fiance of 9 years and that day will be the second time my mother 58f and my sister 36f have been in the same room together in almost two years. For context our biological father was abusive to our mother, left when I was four years old and has made two confusing attempts to make contact with me since then. Mentioning him quickly became something i didn‚Äôt want to do after my mother started referring to him as ‚Äúthat man who used to live with us‚Äù and even scolding me for asking why one of her hundreds of envelopes of photos was almost empty as it turned out it once contained photos of him. It went as far as me hiding the name of one of my friends at school because he had the same name. Now i imagine raising two kids that reminded you of your abusive ex was hard but on more than one occasion my sister and i were imprisoned in our bedroom as our mother would remove the door handle from the inside. I know this happened more than once as I once outsmarted her by preemptively hiding a pair of pliers in my room for the next time she did it so we could escape. We always called our stepfather ‚Äúdad‚Äù and never really developed a close bond but not through lack of trying. I can imagine its also hard to raise the kids of another man especially when that man replaced you then left. My sister and I always completed chores around the house, it was always our duty to wash the dishes and particularly my duty to make coffee when i learnt to use the kettle when i was about seven years old and then also cutting the grass. Not that either of these tasks were unreasonable but more often than not the request for coffee came in the form of my dad storming through the door from work and shouting ‚ÄúCOFFEE‚Äù. To add to this my half brother was born when i was six and was only ever responsible for cleaning the bathroom and my half sister was born when i was 16 and was never even allowed to even use the toaster until she was 16. She never lifted a finger. After needing a lot of help to get through school with encouragement to the tune of ‚Äúyour dad left school with no grades and amounted to nothing and you‚Äôre going the same way‚Äù, I joined the army. My entire family and close family friends all bet on how long i would last and it was never acknowledged that i not only outlasted their expectations but excelled during basic training and completed nine years. When i left i moved from job to job while trying to join the ambulance service and become a paramedic which led to me and my fiance moving to another part of the country. At the same time my youngest sister moved to the opposite end of the country to go to university. I now lived four hours away from our parents while she lived three hours away but my parents have visited me twice in the five years while they dont really hide how often they have visited my sister but we‚Äôve all lost count. Then came the crux of the fallout. Two years ago my grandad 80m was taken into hospital with gallstones in his bile duct requiring an outpatient endoscopy appointment. Unfortunately before this was diagnosed he was inappropriately given a bed in the covid section of a dementia ward due to lack of space. He had neither but developed covid and my nana 80f has asthma and COPD. She was concerned and wanted him home till his appointment which doctors were advising but my mother tried to make out that she clearly couldn‚Äôt make decisions safely for herself and refused to pick my grandad up from hospital. My sister and I reasoned with her that this wasn‚Äôt a fair assumption to make and nor was it anyone else‚Äôs business to prevent if she wanted it and doctors were advising it. But she stood firm and went silent in the family group chat. Historically an indication that shes choosing to talk to people that will listen to her and bad mouth those who wont. My sister then developed a cerebro spinal fluid leak from some procedure she had for a slipped disc and was laid up in bed unable to look after her kids appropriately so my brother in law had to call in sick with his job offshore to support her. Despite living around the corner from my parents. My youngest sister developed a throat infection at the same time and my parents drove 6 hours to pick her up and bring her home. This ticked my sister off who brought it up in the group chat when my mother with very little protest removed herself from it and cut my sister and her family off. My mother doesn‚Äôt believe my sister should be allowed to speak to her that way but i tried to reason with her that in a healthy relationship she should be concerned at why my sister felt it was necessary to do so. Shes ignored this. And as a result has had no involvement with her son in law or grandkids and neither has our stepdad who fell out with nobody. Since then it has been discovered that my stepdad has liver cirrhosis from excessive alcohol and my mother told me but asked me not to tell my sister because ‚Äúyour dad doesn‚Äôt want your youngest sister finding out and reconciliation shouldn‚Äôt come just because he is unwell‚Äù. To which i pointed out that it would be fair for my older sister to come to that conclusion too, given that i expect this is all a game. She knows i am more loyal to my older sister than to her and will likely tell her anyway. At which point she can and will fall out with me, but also when my sister doesn‚Äôt come running to reconcile (which she also isn‚Äôt doing) my mother has another reason to incite hate towards her. I am now not prepared to have my wedding ruined with any of her antics and I know my sister can be expected to avoid her, but also, i am tired of all the manipulation and her inability to take any responsibility. To the point i just dont want anything to do with her anymore which will likely cause a rift in the family and also potentially cause problems for my wedding. ",0,1749338085.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

Neither was Adam. There were 10 of us. Five Adam‚Äôs and five Eve‚Äôs handcuffed together in a room with no doors. When I opened my eyes, staring at an unfamiliar ceiling, my name was Eve. 

I had no other names but Eve. There were nine bodies spread around me, including a boy, a *lump* attached to me, curled into a ball. 

Our real identities were lost, though I could recall small things, tiny splinters still holding on. I saw a dark room filled with twinkling fairy lights, a bookshelf decorated with titles I never read, boxes of prescribed medication sticking from an overflowing trash can. The walls were covered in sticky notes and calendars, a chalkboard bearing a countdown to a date that had long since passed. 

*‚ÄúI thought you were going to try this time? Why do you make it so hard?‚Äù*

The voice was a ghost in my head. She didn't have a name, barely an identity, but my heart knew her. She existed as a shadow right in the back of my mind, suppressed deep down. With her, I remembered the rain soaking my face, and my pounding footsteps through dirt.

When I tried to dive deeper inside these splinters, I hit a wall. It should have confused me, angered me, but I couldn't feel anger. 

There was only a sense of melancholy that I had lost someone close to me. With no proper memories, though, I didn't feel sad.I wasn't the first one awake. There were others, but neither of us spoke, trapped inside our own minds. Drawing my knees to my chest, I wondered what the others were feeling and thinking. 

Did they have loved ones they couldn't fully remember? 

I did know one thing. There was something wrong with my body, the bones in my knees cracking when I moved them.

Everything felt stiff and wrong, my neck giving a satisfying popping noise when I tipped my head left to right. The room was made of glass. Four glass walls casting four different versions of me. It was like looking into a fun mirror, each variant of me growing progressively more contorted, a monster blinking back. 

There was a metal thing wrapped around my wrist, and when I tugged it, the lump next to me groaned. I noticed the handcuff (and the lump) when I was half awake. But I thought I was hallucinating. The lump had breath that smelled of garlic coffee, and he snored. *Adam*, my mind told me. 

The lump‚Äôs name was *Adam*. 

Everything about me felt‚Ä¶new. Like a blank slate. I had no real thoughts or memories. The boy attached to me was different from the others. Adam was dressed in the same bland clothes, but his had colour, a single streak of bright red stained his shirt. I found myself poking it, and he leaned back, his eyes widening. 

The red was dry, ingrained into the material. Which meant at some point, Adam had been bleeding. Not a lot, and he didn't look like he had any wounds. 

I studied him. Or, I guess, we studied each other. He was a wiry brunette with freckles and zero flaws, like his face had been airbrushed. This wasn't the *natural* kind of airbrush. I could see where someone or something had attempted to scrape away his freckles too, the skin of his left cheek a raw pinkish colour. I wasn't a stranger to this thing either. 

I could see where several spots on my face had been surgically removed. The boy glued to my side was an enigma in a room drowned of color. The red on him made him stand out in a sea of white, a mystery I immediately wanted to solve. 

I couldn't help it, prodding the guy‚Äôs face, running my finger down his cheek and stabbing my nail under his nose for signs of bleeding. I was curious, and curiosity didn't belong in the white room full of blank slates. I wondered if the old me looked for that kind of thing. 

Her bookshelf *was* full of horror and crime thriller, an entire box-set of a detective series my mind wasn't allowed to remember. There was that wall again, this time slamming down firmly on the room with the fairy lights. 

There was too much of *me* in my fragmented memory, the girl who wasn't Eve. I wasn't fully aware that I was violently prodding Adam, until he wafted my hand away. The boy opened his mouth to speak, his eyes narrowing with irritation, before his mind reminded him that irritation did not exist in the white room. 

I watched the anger in his eyes fizzle out, and he frowned at me, adapting the expression of a baby deer. I think he was trying to be angry, trying to yell at me. When I realized he couldn't swear, or didn't know *how* to swear, he distanced himself from me, turning his back and folding his arms. 

I got the hint, shuffling away, only for the handcuffs to violently snap us back together. ‚ÄúThis is a recorded message stated by the United States Government on eight, twenty seven, two thousand and twenty three regarding The Adam And Eve Project. Please listen carefully. This message will not be repeated.‚Äù 

A text to speech voice drew my attention to the ceiling, and next to me, Adam let out a quiet hiss. ‚ÄúYou have been unconscious for thirty five days and sixteen hours, following awakening.

It is recommended that you remain where you are.‚Äù The voice was pre-recorded, but it definitely sounded aimed toward the Adam who was crawling towards a door that *looked* like a wall, but I could see the subtle glint of a handle. 

‚ÄúTwo hundred years ago, on April 5th 2023, NASA announced the discovery of DarkSky, a potentially hazardous NEO (Near Earth Object) was estimated to miss our planet, flying by at just 19,000 miles (32,000 kilometers).‚Äù 

*Two hundred years ago.*

The robot‚Äôs voice wasn't fully registering in my brain. The text to speech voice paused, and a screen lit up in front of us displaying DarkSky, and then flickering to several news screens. 

CBS, NBC, Fox News and BBC all with red banners and panicked looking presenters. ‚ÄúHowever. During its passing, the DarkSky asteroid‚Äôs collision course changed, striking our planet on April 13th, 2023, causing global destruction and a mass extinction event.‚Äù

A screen showed us the entirety of the West Coast underwater. New York, London, Seoul, Tokyo, all of them. 

Either wiped from the map, or uninhabitable. ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù I wasn't expecting Adam to speak, his voice more of a croak.

His eyes widened, like he was remembering who he was before Adam. ‚ÄúThat's Apophis.‚Äù He scratched the back of his head. ‚Äú2029.‚Äù

Adam‚Äôs random declaration of words and numbers intrigued me. I inclined my head, motioning for him to continue, but he just shot me a look. Adam was a lot better at emotions than me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ said something.‚Äù My own voice was a static whisper. 

He blinked, narrowing his eyes. ‚ÄúNo, I didn't.‚Äù

Turning away from the boy, I decided to ignore him, and all of his future declarations. I should have been terrified, mourning the loss of not just my loved ones, but my entire planet. 

But I didn't have any memories of the world  except the rain, and a dark bedroom filled with fairy lights. I could have been a traveller, visiting every country and documenting each one. All of that had been taken away, and yet I couldn't feel sad or betrayed. Why would I mourn a planet I didn't remember? 

‚ÄúPlease listen carefully.‚Äù The voice continued. ‚ÄúYou have been carefully selected in a choosing process for the Adam and Eve program. Humanity's last chance of survival. Two hundred years ago, you were cryogenically frozen in an attempt to restart in a new world."" 

I nodded, drinking the words in. ""Presently for you, the earth is estimated to be habitable.‚Äù When the lights flickered off, the screen lit up, displaying exactly what the voice said. A new world, and the bluest sky stretching out across a never ending horizon. I found myself transfixed, smiling dazedly at brand new oceans and newly formed continents. 

‚ÄúWe ask this,‚Äù the message crackled. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the President of the United States, will you do what we couldn't? Will you make the new world a better place? Will you fix the mistakes of your predecessors and restart our sick world?‚Äù

I heard my reply before I was aware of the word in my mouth. 

*Yes.*

The screen was brighter, that beautiful blue sky so hard to look away from. ‚ÄúWill *you* create humans you are proud of?‚Äù

*Yes.*

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Adam‚Äôs murmur followed mine, the others echoing. 

‚ÄúWill *you* be our future hope? Will you destroy every human being who goes against the new earth and spill blood in the name of Adam and Eve?‚Äù

*‚ÄùYes.‚Äù*

The room flooded with light, and I blinked rapidly, drool seeping down my chin. It was the voice's next words that tore away my mind. 

‚ÄúIt is with great displeasure, however, that we must inform you there are limited resources in our stockpile.‚Äù The ceiling opened up, a large ratty bag dropping onto the ground. It was a brand new color, but this time, a mouldy green. Something snapped in two inside my mind. It didn't belong in the new world. It was‚Ä¶ poison from our predecessors. 

I backed away with the others, yanking Adam with me. At first, he didn't move, cross legged, a smile stretched across his lips. I don't think he noticed the bag. He was starry eyed, unblinking at the screen still filled with the new world. 

*Our* new world.

That was ours to mould into our own. ‚ÄúThere is no need for panic,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúConsider this bag an artefact of the lost world. There is nothing to fear.‚Äù 

Fear.

I wasn't sure I knew what that was. Did my old self feel *fear* running through the rain? 

Did I feel *fear* witnessing my planet burn right in front of me? ‚ÄúThere can only be *one* Adam, and *One* Eve in the new world.‚Äù The voice continued. ‚ÄúPlease choose among yourselves. You have two minutes.‚Äù

I didn't experience fear when the tranquillity in the white room dissolved. 

Adam violently pulled me to my feet when an Eve with a blonde bob dove inside the bag and pulled out a gun. She shouldn't have been able to use it. Our memories were gone, our old selves footprints in the sand. 

But it was the way her fingers expertly wrapped around the butt, that made me think otherwise. The Eve didn't hesitate, and with perfect aim, blew the heads off of two Adam‚Äôs, and then another Eve. 

I watched more colour splatter and pool and stain the white room, bodies falling like dominoes. When an Eve stepped toward me, my Adam pulled me across the room, dipped into the bag, his fingers wrapped around a machete. He threw me a gun, and another Adam dived for it. 

Still no fear. 

I ducked and grabbed it, my hands working for me, shooting the Adam between the eyes. I realized what we needed to do to survive.

But it wasn't fear that made me kill. It was necessary for the new earth. The words were in my head, suffocating my thoughts. We had limited resources. There was no screaming, no crying, or begging. An Eve knocked me onto my face, but there was no pain. 

She kicked me in the head, plunging her knife into the back of my leg. Still no pain. 

Blood stained me, running down my chin. No pain. I didn't think, I just acted. One Adam and Eve left, and they were hardest to take down. The Eve circled me, eyes narrowed, calculating my every move. 

Adam and I communicated through nods and head gestures. Adam told me to go for the sandy haired Adam, while he would take a swipe at an Eve. I was taken off guard when the Adam surrendered, only to kick me onto my back, knocking Adam off balance too. I thought we were going to die. But my Adam had been following and predicting their every move. 

Back to back, I reached for my gun. Two bullets left. I managed to get Eve straight through her left eye. I didn't notice we were the only ones left until the walls were stained red, my hands coated with Adam‚Äôs and Eve‚Äôs, and the final Adam was lying in a stemming pool of blood. I had pieces of skull stuck in my hair, and I was out of breath, but I felt a sense of triumph.

There was so much blood, but it was the blood of the *old* world. Both of us knew that. Adam turned to me, his eyes filled with stars, his skin stained red. I thought he was going to hug me, but his gaze found the screen where our new world awaited us. The two of us were breathless, awaiting the next instructions. But none came. I counted hours, and then a full day. 

Adam had gotten progressively less appealing the longer I stayed isolated with him. He sat against the wall with his knees to his chest, head of matted curls against the glass, the two of us suffocating in the stink from the slow decomposition around us. The other Adam‚Äôs and Eve‚Äôs were in their first stage. 

Bloating. How did I know that? 

‚Äú2029.‚Äù Adam kept muttering to himself, over and over again. 

It was the same number, repeatedly. I couldn't feel anger or irritable, but I was confused *why* he was saying it. 

Another day went by, and I was starting to feel deeply suppressed hunger start to bleed through. I watched Adam counting to himself, his eyes closed, feet tapping on the floor, and wondered if the new world would accept cannibalism. 

Adam stared at himself in the fun-mirror a lot, making noises with his mouth. I wasn't fully concentrating when he turned to me, blurting, ‚ÄúHow big was Apophis again?‚Äù

To me, his words were alien, and I ignored him. But then he started talking again, spewing random words. ‚ÄúHuntley Diving Centre. Med school. Cheese sandwich. Man with a bald head.‚Äù

When I told him to stop, he continued. ‚ÄúVan. Cheese sandwich. Pretty Little Liars.‚Äù He knocked his head against the wall. ‚ÄúProfessor Jacobs told me to go but I didn't want to go. I told him I'd call the cops, and then I'm seeing silver.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù

‚ÄúBad news,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúVery bad news I'm not allowed to tell anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdam.‚Äù

I think I was irritated. 

""You're talking too."" He grumbled. 

Was he feeling *anger*? 

I didn't realize I was angry, until my blood was boiling, my teeth gritted together. ""Yes, because you keep singing and talking, and making mouth noises-- and you're driving me insane!"" 

His grin told me one thing. No matter what happened, and what toxic and tainted parts of humans we wanted to leave behind, we were those last remnants. 

""Don't look at me like that."" I snapped. 

He rolled his eyes. ""Like *what*?"" 

""Like that!"" I turned towards the wall, folding my arms. 

""Immature."" he muttered. 

""*I'm* the immature one?!"" 

Adam sighed. When I turned my head, his eyes flickered shut. ‚ÄúUnited States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru,‚Äù his gaze tracked the screen in front of us. ‚ÄúRepublic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too--"" 

I don't know what possessed me to whip around, lunging at him like an animal. I got close. So close, shuffling over to him, his breath tickled my chin. Adam's eyes were still closed, but he was smiling, and my stomach fluttered. I leaned forward, suddenly remembering that as Adam and Eve, we had a job to do. I think he knew that too, because the second I moved closer, he jolted away. 

""I'd rather reproduce with a plant."" Adam muttered. I was suddenly consumed with fear. I *had* to continue the human race. 

But did it have to be with *him*? 

*‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found them!‚Äù an Adam‚Äôs voice, a *human* voice ripped me from strange, foggy-like thoughts. 

I shuffled back, swiping at my eyes. 

Was I... *crying*?

‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù

Thundering footsteps followed and something in my gut twisted. I stood up, swaying. Adam followed, half lidded eyes barely finding mine. His expression was new. I think mine was too. 

Fear. 

*Humans.*

Before I knew what was happening, I was being grabbed by masked men, who were surprisingly gentle. Humans. I didn't know what to say. I asked them how they survived the asteroid impact, and they told me to stay calm. Adam was behind me, his arms pinned behind his back. 

He was being told to stay calm, but Adam *was* calm. He may have been nodding along to the human‚Äôs words, but he was thinking exactly what I was. When an Eve cupped my cheeks and asked if I was okay, my gaze flicked to my discarded gun. 

‚ÄúOliva!‚Äù She was yelling in my face. ‚ÄúSweetie, you're in shock. Can you tell me how many fingers I‚Äôm holding up?‚Äù

I nodded dizzily, unable to tear my gaze from my weapon. ‚ÄúFive.‚Äù

**There could only be ONE Adam and ONE Eve.**

I felt fear for the first time when Adam and I were led through large silver doors and into blinding sunlight. When it faded and my eyes found clarity, I wasn't seeing breathtaking views of mountains and newly formed oceans. Across the road, a woman was walking her dog.

A school bus flew past, then an ambulance, a long line of traffic snaking down the road. I could smell Chinese food, my mouth watering. When Adam started screaming, my fear came back, and it was enough to unravel me completely, sending me to my knees. I was still stained in blood, wrapped in a blanket I could barely feel. My mind that had been ripped apart, that had splintered for the good of our humanity, was starting to crumble. 

Humanity didn't *need* fucking saving. 

It only truly hit me when I was sitting in the back of a cop car, Adam in the front seat, his knees pressed to his chest, that I *wasn't* a last savior of our species. 

The earth was still spinning, still alive in modern day 2023, and I was just *Eve*. 

The Eve who sat next to me in the back of the car, gently rubbing my hands, told me my name was Olivia. I was a twenty four year old student, and I had been missing for three years. Adam‚Äôs name was *Kai.*

He was twenty three, and a med student. 

No, we were *Adam* and *Eve.* 

I spent a while in another white room, but this time I wasn't forced to kill people. I was told I had been through  brutal torture I could not remember. I told her that was impossible, and then she calmly showed me my legs and arms. I was covered in burns, old and new bruises, my body sliced open and stitched up. 

With this abuse, my kidnappers had successfully turned me into a shell of myself. I was asked if I wanted therapy to revisit those memories, but I declined. I was happy being Eve, even if it was just for a while. 

I saw Adam several times, but he was never fully conscious, either strapped to a bed, muttering to himself, or cross legged on the floor, head tipped back. 

I was two months into my treatment when he barged into my room, a hospital gown only just clinging onto his ass. ""Eve."" He looked *drunk*, stumbling over to my bed. Adam grabbed my glass of water, drained half it, and spitting it out. 

""Or whatever your real name is."" He bit into my half-eaten stale cupcake. Again, Adam spat it out. ""This tastes like shit, Eve.""

""Olivia."" I said.

""Sounds fake.""

""That's one week old cupcake you're eating.""

He spat the rest out, and against all odds, I couldn't resist a smile. ""*You* look like shit."" He said, trying to lean against the wall. ""Love the hospital dress. He raised a brow. It's very *I just got out of the psych ward*.""

With his memories back, Adam was even more insufferable. I ignored that. ""Are you bleeding?"" 

I was referring to the smear of red dripping down his arm. Adam shrugged. ""It's a scratch."" He saluted me with cupcake wrapper. ""I ripped out my IV.""

I reached for my panic button, but he got there first. ‚Äú2029.‚Äù Adam said, his words slurring. ‚ÄúIhhhhs when Apophis is going to hit us.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. My re-education was going well. I was getting my emotions back in full. Which, of course, included annoyance. ‚ÄúIt's going to *miss* us.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink!‚Äù Adam hissed, pressing his finger to his lips. ‚ÄúGotta be quiet! Shhhhh!‚Äù 

Shutting the door *painfully* slowly like he was in a cartoon skit, Adam stumbled over to my bed prodding at his neck. 

‚ÄúThey stabbed me,‚Äù he said in a manic giggle, ‚ÄúBut I'm not stupid! I'm smart! I'm like sooo smart and it's been driving me crazy, but now I see it! This is why they took me away and played with my head! I was dumb at first! So, so dumb. But I remembered 2029. And it came back to me piece by *piece*, Eve.""

Adam leaned forward. ‚ÄúApophis. 2029,‚Äù he said, his breath tickling my cheek. ‚ÄúIs why we were taken.‚Äù

He burst out laughing, and I stabbed the panic button. 

‚ÄúCan't you see? April? 2029? 19,000 miles! A biiiiig lump of space rock going zooooooom!‚Äù he stopped laughing, slamming his fist into his palm. 

Impact. 

‚ÄúBANG!""

Adam‚Äôs eyes widened, his expression crumpling. ""That's what's going to happen! We lose all of them!"" He took a deep breath, and I braced myself. 

""Do *not* start singing.""

""United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru."" This time, it was with purpose, emphasising every country. 

""Adam."" 

He didn't reply, almost in spite. ""Republic Dominican, Cuba, Caribbean, Greenland, El Salvador too.‚Äù The guy shook his head. ""Don't you remember the song they taught us? That's where it's going to hit!"" 

 ""Also from a cartoon."" I corrected. 

He surprised me by wrapping his arms around me in a hug. Adam was warm. 

His scent was a mixture of toffee and bleach. I tried *really* hard to tell myself the bandage wrapped around his head was a good thing. That he was getting better. ""You don't know me, and I don't know you,"" he muffled into my shoulder. ""But neither of us can deny what we went though-- and what they want us *for*."" His grip tightened. ""They're trying to take away what I know-- and what I *know* is that that asteroid is not going to miss.""

""Eve."" he straightened up, and he looked so vulnerable. ‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù He whispered, before crumpling into a heap. I tried to help him, before my door swung open, several Eve's in white dragging him out. According to them, he ‚Äòwas experiencing mild side effects from treatment.‚Äô

Unlike me, Adam chose to get his memories back. Yeah, that's not a good idea. Olivia‚Äôs mind was too much, too painful. My old life started to seep back in the form of loved ones as I was slowly deconditioned. 

I stopped referring to boys and girls and Adam‚Äôs and Eve‚Äôs, and was firmly told ‚ÄúThe New Earth‚Äù was just fantasy, all of the destruction I saw generated with AI. 

I have a girlfriend, who visited me every day. She said I didn't have to take the therapy, but I know she wants me to remember Olivia. Her name is Charlie, and when I was released from the white room, she took me back to our shared house. 

I have two roommates. Sam and Matt. Both of them kept their distance for a while, especially when I accidentally referred to them as Adam‚Äôs. I'm still getting letters from the facility politely ‚Äúinviting‚Äù me for a therapy session. I‚Äôm ignoring them, but I have started seeing a single black van outside our house. I think my kidnappers are back, and I'm terrified. 

The facility told me to call them AS SOON as I see anyone suspicious. I've told Charlie and the guys to hide upstairs, and right now I'm in our living room. It's pitch black outside, but I can see a figure standing directly outside our house. I've  turned off all the lights. Every time I blink, I swear they're getting closer. 

And I think... fuck. I think it's *Adam.*",7,1749337980.0,stories,1,0.9,False

Florence Frequently Asked Questions

Hello lovely people of Reddit!

For the past few years of my Reddit life, I have seen that many questions regarding aspects of Florence get repeated periodically in this sub (and in a couple others), so I‚Äôve decided to try and make a series of FFAQs [Florence Frequently Asked Questions] posts, hoping to help anyone who might be searching for useful information on our beautiful city. This post is about food, hopefully if it is appreciated I will be doing more in the near future.

I hope you will find it useful! 
(If you do and would like to offer me a coffee, you can do so from my profile)
 
__________________________   
  
_You have just spent the day trekking around the city (I bet you haven‚Äôt walked this much in a long time!), admiring the beauty of Florence and immersing yourself in the magical vibe and incredible atmosphere of the city, and now you are hungry and can‚Äôt wait to sit down (or stand up) and enjoy some delicious local food.._  
  
_But wait! **What** is the local food that is served in Florence?  **Where** can you go to find it? And **how** is it eaten?_  
  
These are the questions that I will be trying to answer in this post.
  
**HOW**  
The classic Italian (and thus also Florentine) menu is usually divided in:  

- Antipasto: (literally ‚Äúbefore the meal‚Äù) it‚Äôs what in English is usually called a starter. Usually a small plate, not too complicated, eatable in a few bites, and that the restaurant can get ready quickly and give you will they prepare the main dishes. You can sometimes accompany it with a glass of white wine (usually Prosecc
- Primo: (literally ‚Äúthe first‚Äù) it‚Äôs the main course. In Florence (and in all of Italy) it‚Äôs nearly always a pasta dish. Sometimes listed as primo you can also find a risotto or a soup.  
- Secondo: (literally ‚Äúthe second‚Äù) it‚Äôs the second course, served on a flat plate, usually consisting in cooked meat or fish (or vegetarian/vegan alternatives if the restaurant has them).   
- Contorno: (literally ‚Äúoutline‚Äù/‚Äúcontour‚Äù) it‚Äôs a side dish. It‚Äôs usually cooked vegetables/legumes/potatoes. Sometimes it will be served on the same plate as the Secondo, but most of the time it will come on a small side plate.  
- Dolce: (literally ‚Äúsweet‚Äù/‚Äúcake‚Äù) it‚Äôs dessert. Many restaurants will have it listed on a separate menu which you will have to ask the waiter to bring you.  
- Caff√® e Amaro: coffee and bitter. Both are usually served only at the end of the meal. 


Other useful info:  
- it is rare that people will go through a full course meal ordering all of what I‚Äôve listed above. It is much more common to have an antipasto (sometimes shared) and a primo OR a secondo.  
- when you want the bill (‚Äúil conto‚Äù) you will have to ask a waiter for it. Same goes for anything you may need during the meal.  
You will not be disturbed or pressured by waiters during your meal.   
- it is not customary to tip unless you have had an exceptional service. You can do if you want, but don‚Äôt feel pressured into doing so.  
- you will be paying a ‚Äúcoperto‚Äù fee, which covers the table service (plates, cutlery, bread etc). It‚Äôs usually a couple euros (2-4) per person. It is absolutely normal.
- you can order a ‚Äúvino della casa‚Äù in most restaurants, which will bring you a jug with some basic (but usually) good house wine without having to buy an expensive bottle.  
- you won‚Äôt be served tap water (unless you ask for it directly). You will be given a 3‚Ç¨ glass water bottle. 

  
**WHERE**    

No, I won‚Äôt be telling you the names of specific restaurants: that would be impossible, since there are more than two thousand restaurants in the city (2233 according to tripadvisor at the time I‚Äôm writing this post), and there are continuously new openings (and closings).  
Also, listing names would be wrong because for sure I would be biased by personal experiences and preferences, and I could easily be accused of having been bribed for free pubblicity, so no, I will not be naming specific restaurants.  
 
What I will do, though, is give you a few tips for you to choose wisely.    
First of all, you should know that there are various types of restaurants, and you can usually categorise them directly from the name:  
  
- RISTORANTE:  this is the basic type of restaurant. You will probably find a bit of everything, from starters to mains to second courses. It has a bit of a formal feel.
  
- TRATTORIA:  this is what you need to look for for an authentic local food experience. A trattoria is usually a small welcoming and familiar restaurant, not at all formal, where you will experience the best traditional food, where every dish will probably have its own story. Often a trattoria is family run and during the meal you will be chatted to in a friendly manner by the waiters or owners. It‚Äôs all about conviviality and good food. 
  
- OSTERIA:  in the past it used to be a place that offerted hospitality, both regarding food, wine and also accomodation. In present times, it tends to be quite similar to a trattoria, with a slight sharper focus on the wine selection. 
  
- PIZZERIA:  not much explanation needed. If you go to a pizzeria you will be having pizza. Usually one per person (it‚Äôs rare that two people share a single pizza, unless they are sharing also another dish). Some pizzerie will offer also a limited selection of mains, but why would you want to have those if you chose a pizzeria?
  
- ENOTECA:  once it was a place where you went to buy wine. Over time it started offering wine tastings, and now it also offers a limited selection of food. The focus is mainly on wine though. 
  
- BAR: it has nothing to do with the English meaning. A bar in Italy (and Florence) is a multipurpose food and drinks place. A bar is where you can go for breakfast, a bar is where you stop for a coffee or a fruit juice, a bar is where you go to have a quick sandwich for lunch, a bar is where you go to eat a quick dish of pasta during your work lunch break, a bar is where you meet your friends to have an aperitivo, a bar is where pensioners meet and spend the day playing cards and drinking beer. The only thing you wouldn‚Äôt choose a bar for is a formal meal.
  
**WHAT**   
 Typical Florentine (and Tuscan) dishes originate from a poor, countryside style tradition, so they tend to focus more on quantity and substance instead of appearance and elegance. They rely on the quality of fresh, quality ingredients. Here is a list of some of the main Florentine dishes, with a quick explanation of each:   
- RIBOLLITA:  
- PAPPA AL POMODORO:  
- PAPPARDELLE AL CINGHIALE:  
- PAPPARDELLE AL RAG√ö DI LEPRE:
- PANZANELLA:
- BISTECCA ALLA FIORENTINA:  
- ZUPPA TOSCANA:  
- CARABACCIA:  
- TRIPPA:  
- LAMPREDOTTO:  
- ZUCCOTTO:  
- CANTUCCI E VIN SANTO:

Like so many of you, my journey started small ‚Äì just a few Pops (and I¬†still¬†remember the thrill of finding that very first one!¬†Mine was a discounted bubble-head Black Panther Okoye character I grabbed on my way to cashier's at Forbidden's Planet in London.

They lived on my shelf, and my ""tracking system"" was... well, a mix of iPhone photos and a messy spreadsheet. It¬†kinda¬†worked... until it didn't.

https://preview.redd.it/c10y80yj4l5f1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=245b0916656327609473519f238ecde15b172b3b

As my collection exploded (Pops, then pokemon cards, then LEGO snuck in... sound familiar?), and I started swapping and selling, that system imploded. Trying to remember what I had, its value, or just finding a specific item in my own photos became a total nightmare. I needed something better ‚Äì a true digital twin of my physical shelves, something intuitive with real-time insights and actual inventory smarts.

So, I built it. For myself.¬†(I'm a software developer, so this was my way of scratching my own itch!). It took about¬†2 months of pretty intense day-and-night coding. I got¬†super¬†obsessive about the details ‚Äì probably slowed myself down, but I wanted it to feel right¬†for me. I looked at what was out there, identified the gaps that frustrated¬†me, and just kept building.

The biggest headache I wanted to solve? Bulk adding.¬†Manually scanning barcodes or searching for every single Pop on a packed shelf? Pure tedium. I¬†had¬†to find a better way.

My (slightly crazy) experiment? AI Shelf Scanning.¬†I trained a system using computer vision so you could just take a¬†photo of a whole shelf section, and it tries to identify the Pops automatically. No individual scans, no typing. Just snap and (hopefully) match. (Training this thing? Yeah, that involved¬†way¬†too much coffee and more than a few truly sleepless nights üòÖ).

Of course, I also built a robust custom barcode scanner that pulls data from multiple sources because sometimes tech needs a fallback.

**Here's why I'm sharing this with you all now:**

I've been using this personal tool for a while, and honestly, it's transformed¬†my¬†collecting experience. But I'm incredibly curious about how¬†other¬†passionate collectors manage and what¬†they¬†dream of. This community's perspective is invaluable.

2. What's the ONE feature missing everywhere else¬†that drives you nuts? What makes tracking feel like a chore instead of part of the fun?
3. Imagine the perfect collection manager:¬†Forget what exists ‚Äì what feature (big or small) would genuinely make you¬†excited¬†to manage your collection? Bulk adding? Automated value tracking? Virtual shelf organization? Trading tools? Something totally wild?

This isn't about an app ‚Äì it's about the passion we share.¬†I built this for my own sanity as a collector, but hearing what¬†truly matters¬†to this community would be amazing. What are your pain points? Your wishlist features? What would make tracking your treasures seamless and maybe even fun?

Thanks for reading my story and for being part of the community that makes collecting so awesome!",2,1749337548.0,funkopop,0,1.0,False
1l5xrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1l5xrow/just_my_depression_log/,just my Depression Log.,"{just really wanted to be open and honest, putting it out there (somethings not all things) im not new to this sub I've many many many posts here before and I'm here again to be honest i put out these posts not for reassurance but as a Log 

  
does anybody else just feel...tired? stale? just dried and i mean both physically, mentally and spiritually? like days melt together and the perception of time feels broken? i forget the days easily anymore and i spend most of my days daydreaming? anybody else daydream for hours? i daydream for hours a week. daydreaming of what-ifs and what abouts. i daydream while in the shower, working, drinking my coffee in the morning and especially listening to Music is where i do the most of my daydreaming, a different life a different chance.

  
Speaking of which do any of you also just feel weak? eyes heavy as they sting? ever get the confusing feeling fo wanting to do things but at the same time you dont wanna do anything at all? or when your mind goes blank and pitch black and you REALLY Dont know what you want, or where to go from here? anybody else mind just feel empty? like when you try to think sometimes you can't at all, makes me feel really really stupid.

  
anybody else start to hold on tight to the nostalgia of the past and i mean hold on TIGHT! feeling like if i where to let go that i'd have nothing? i get this ALOT i like nostalgia but i understand the way im using it to ""cope"" is really really toxic but its really hard to let go, to let go to the person you used to be, the environment, headspace you know?

im not gonna sugarcoat it im scared, im man enough to admit im really sacred of life in general. i have an unhealthy obsession with ""trying to leave my mark in the world"" one of my worst fears of my life is being forgotten, living a life without achievement, without purpose, without reaching my ""inner potential"" it scares me alot always puts me on edge i know this obsession has alot to do with my upbringing since i did lose my parents (parents didnt want me) but i cant shake the feeling u know? that   intense Firey need to let people know ""Yea i did this, or i worked on this or i help make this"".

  
i know im only a very very young adult (21) but i still wonder where i am even going anymore, everything is a mud track i am my own worst critic for sure my brain makes me feel like the worst person ever makes me question myself it really does.",2,1749337547.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôd love any advice‚Äîdaily/monthly routines, opening/closing tips, or just general wisdom. Also, how would you recommend I approach the current baristas and start building a good relationship with the team?

Really appreciate any insights‚Äîthanks in advance",2,1749337542.0,starbucksbaristas,3,1.0,False
1l5xrn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1l5xrn1/currently_positive_any_measures_im_not_thinking_of/,Currently positive. Any measures I‚Äôm not thinking of?,"Thought I was feeling icky because of the wildfire smoke yesterday but took a covid test just in case and was negative, but today it was positive. It‚Äôs my third infection unfortunately, so I‚Äôve done this before and successfully avoided passing it onto household members, but wanted to share my infection plan in case anyone has thoughts. 

To protect my housemate: Hepas in both of our bedrooms and a bigger one on the main floor, completing isolating (I have an on-suite bathroom and she is leaving food outside of my door), masks when I open my bedroom door. 

For me: lots of rest, lots of fluids (including electrolytes), multivitamins including C, D, and Zinc, saline rinses, CPC mouthwash, minimal caffeine and choosing green tea rather than coffee. I‚Äôve also heard good things about antihistamines so was considering that. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt qualify for paxlovid here and I don‚Äôt have a family doctor so I don‚Äôt really have someone to ask about metformin. 

Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything else I should be thinking about! I want to do absolutely everything I can to keep myself as healthy as possible and avoid getting my housemate sick. ",13,1749337542.0,ZeroCovidCommunity,6,1.0,False
