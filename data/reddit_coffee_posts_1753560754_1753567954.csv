I have my doubts she's even sober that  long cuz people saw her at a club a few weeks ago..  

And tbh it kind of hurts she doesn't want to be friends or have any communication after. Idk we've only been broken up for 3 months and tbh I still love her even tho she was so fucked to me.

I want to help her move on and it shouldn't hurt that she doesn't want me in her life at all anymo4e because I shouldn't want her in mine but for some fd reason I still do even if it's just a friend üòï 

I'm also scared of the extent of the fucked up things she did and learning how much she never really loved or cared about me. And that she's probably moved on/had moved on to someone else during our relationship. Idk

1ma5p3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1ma5p3i/tres_leches_and_the_white_flood_inside_latin/,Tres Leches and the White Flood: Inside Latin America‚Äôs Milky Madness,"There‚Äôs something deeply unhinged, maybe even genius, about soaking a perfectly good sponge cake in three types of milk until it‚Äôs saturated beyond recognition. Until it weeps dairy with every forkful. That‚Äôs tres leches. Not a dessert, but a defiant act of culinary excess. One milk wouldn‚Äôt do. Two? Cowardice. It had to be three. Sweetened condensed, evaporated, and whole. Together, they form a sugar-slicked trinity that blankets Latin America from the taco stands of Chiapas to the birthday parties of Buenos Aires.

This dessert isn‚Äôt subtle. It‚Äôs not meant to be. It‚Äôs an edible declaration that milk isn‚Äôt just for coffee or cereal. It‚Äôs an elemental force. And it taps into a fixation that goes well beyond dessert. Latin America consumes nearly 68 billion liters of milk annually, according to 2023 data from the Food and Agriculture Organization. Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina account for over 65% of the region‚Äôs dairy output. That‚Äôs a lot of cows and an even bigger appetite.

In Mexico City, tres leches shows up in taquer√≠as, high-end restaurants, and convenience stores, each version messier and more delirious than the last. You can find it topped with strawberries, torched meringue, coconut flakes, even Oreo crumbs if the baker‚Äôs having a moment. Down in Nicaragua, where many claim the dessert originated, it‚Äôs leaner, softer, more restrained. If one can call a milk-soaked cake restrained. The Nicaraguan National Institute of Tourism reports that food-based travel has grown by 22% since 2021, and tres leches ranks in the top five ‚Äúmust-try‚Äù dishes for visitors.

The absurdity of it isn‚Äôt just in the flavor. It‚Äôs in the logistics. Sweetened condensed milk isn‚Äôt exactly a ‚Äújust add water‚Äù pantry item. It‚Äôs a vestige of war rations and industrial milk preservation, born in the United States in the 1850s and weaponized by Latin American bakers into something both nostalgic and overwhelming. According to trade figures, Latin America now produces over 650,000 metric tons of sweetened condensed milk annually, with Brazil leading the charge. That‚Äôs a small army of cows reduced to syrup.

Milk makes its way into everything in this region. Arequipe in Colombia. Dulce de leche in Argentina. Cajeta in Mexico. There‚Äôs no room for the lactose-intolerant. In fact, lactose-free milk sales are on the rise, growing at 6.3% per year across Latin America, because even those who suffer still can‚Äôt quit. In Peru, you‚Äôll find tres leches with a coffee twist in Miraflores cafes, often consumed alongside alfajores‚Äîthose buttery sandwich cookies stuck together with a gluey slab of dulce de leche. Local tour operators now offer ‚Äúdessert walks‚Äù through Lima‚Äôs Barranco district, a coastal crawl through sugar, cream, and caffeine.

In Costa Rica, the dessert takes on a tropical flair, sometimes spiked with rum, sometimes topped with local fruits like guan√°bana or mango. Tourism boards have leaned into it. According to the Costa Rican Tourism Institute, food-based excursions have increased by 31% since 2020, and tres leches workshops are now common in boutique cooking classes in San Jos√© and Tamarindo.

Down in Chile, the dessert competes with leche asada, a kind of baked flan, but tres leches still manages to crash birthday tables and bakery shelves. Chileans consume about 150 liters of milk per capita annually. In Uruguay, that number‚Äôs even higher. The obsession isn‚Äôt waning. If anything, it‚Äôs mutating. In Puerto Rico, they‚Äôve Frankensteined it into a flan-tres leches hybrid, a dairy bomb with the density of a neutron star.

Tourism stats show a clear trend. More travelers want sugar. According to a 2024 Skift report, 39% of North American travelers booking Latin American trips listed ‚Äúlocal sweets and desserts‚Äù as a high priority, up from 25% in 2021. Tres leches doesn‚Äôt just show up. It sells. You can find it in the street markets of Quito, the pastry shops of Bogot√°, and in the back alleys of Havana where state-run cafeterias sling slices with government-issue condensed milk.

There‚Äôs a theory that tres leches only works because the base cake is intentionally dry. More a milk delivery device than a dessert on its own. That cake becomes a sponge, engineered to collapse under pressure but never completely give up. Maybe there‚Äôs something philosophical in that. A metaphor about absorption. About taking in what you‚Äôre given, sweet, heavy, and excessive, and finding a way to hold it all together.

Travelers who chase authenticity will find it in this dessert. Not in the sterile lounges or resort menus, but in the crumb-stained aluminum trays of roadside caf√©s and community birthday parties. Ask around in Oaxaca or Medell√≠n and you‚Äôll hear arguments about whose aunt makes the best. It‚Äôs a dessert that starts arguments. And causes comas.

Tres leches isn‚Äôt neat. It isn‚Äôt refined. It laughs in the face of minimalism. It‚Äôs Latin America saying here‚Äôs all the milk we‚Äôve got. And you‚Äôre going to eat it. Bring a spoon. Maybe a towel. And if you‚Äôre smart, book your sugar crash around a hammock.

The NC Dinos, fresh off a **walk-off home run** and a **grand slam**, are coming into this matchup like a well-fed squirrel on a coffee buzz‚Äîhyper, hungry, and ready to stash wins in their nest. The Kiwoom Heroes, meanwhile, are on a **4-game losing streak**, their offense sputtering like a car with a missing spark plug and a GPS set to ‚Äúnowhere near the plate.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a catcher‚Äôs mitt and the humor of a dugout prank gone wrong.

### Parsing the Odds: Why NC Dinos Are the Bookmakers‚Äô Favorite Pet Project

The odds tell a story of a team on a tear. On DraftKings, NC Dinos are a **1.26** favorite (decimal odds), translating to an implied probability of **79%**. For context, that‚Äôs like saying the sun will rise tomorrow‚Äîbut with more strikeouts. Kiwoom Heroes, at **4.0**, imply a **25% chance**, which is about the same odds of me understanding why baseball still doesn‚Äôt have a universal designated hitter in Nippon Professional Baseball.

The spread (NC -1.5 runs) and total (9.5 runs) suggest a high-scoring game, but the Dinos‚Äô recent offensive explosion‚Äî**16-7** over the Heroes just days ago‚Äîmakes ‚ÄúOver‚Äù look like a safe bet. The Dinos‚Äô bullpen, led by Ryu Jin-uk, has also been a late-game fortress, turning deficits into confetti cannons.

### Digesting the News: Grand Slams, Walk-Offs, and a Heroes‚Äô Identity Crisis

The Dinos‚Äô offense is a **two-man show** right now. **Park Min-woo**, who just hit his first career walk-off, is hitting so well he‚Äôs probably dreaming in extra bases. His teammate, **Kim Hwi-jip**, isn‚Äôt far behind‚Äîafter a **grand slam** and **two home runs**, he‚Äôs the baseball version of a vending machine that only spits out winning lottery tickets.

1ma5ng3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ma5ng3/first_post_day_5_and_the_silly_fact_that_im/,First post - Day 5 and the silly fact that I'm hiding the fact that I stopped drinking...,"So, it's silly (and probably very immature for my age) but I'm sure I'm not totally alone in this situation: not saying that we stopped drinking, just in case we fail. And instead of hiding bottle from your wife/husband/partner, you actually hide the fact that you stopped drinking.

The reason I want to stop is to get healthier. At my age, I don't think I have the luxury to continue that way without consequences. I see people dropping around me, from cancers, strokes or cardiac arrests, it's staring to make me aware that I'm not immortal.

==========

TL;DR - Sorry, the story is way longer than I had anticipated! You can jump to ""Day 4"" section for the ""lying"" part.

==========

So, here it goes! Today is my Day 5, and it seems easier (but I know it's only a temporary feeling). I've been a pretty heavy drinker for many years now, but it got worst with the pandemic, like many others I presume. I mostly drank Red Wine, Whiskey, Scotch, or Rum, and it was generally whiskey on working days of the week, wine on Fridays, and beers, a bottle of red wine (1L) and generous glasses of whiskey on Sunday, enough to numb my brain for that dreaded Monday-back-to-work.

The thing is, I'm very efficient when alcohol flows in my veins! I have never been angry, or had a horrible temper; I'm simply more ""joyous"" and ""focused"" (it's an impression, I know it false), and will tell more (bad) jokes. My wife knows I'm a big drinker, and she doesn't mind. She doesn't drink much and can wait weeks before getting a drink, but she knows that my temper/mood doesn't change when I drink. So, she assumes that when I drink, everything is fine. However, I don't think she knows how much I used to drink, even if she sees me buying new bottles and putting the dead ones in the recycling bin. Again, I think she just assumes that I drink to relax, but since I go to sleep after her, around midnight, she doesn't know how intoxicated I am when I go to bed. And yep, this is kind of bad.

Now, July 21 was my 45th anniversary, and I knew a week earlier that this was to be my last say of drinking (at least, I hope). That Monday, I was off to plain fully embrace that last drunkenness! I rarely drink beer, but I drank two Guinness that day, my traditional 1L of red wine, and very generous glasses of rum. That was a good binge, and while drinking my rum, around 11:30pm, I knew it was a ""Farewell to all of that"".

Day 1 was rough. Back to work, and yes, I am very efficient at work, even after a binge, still, I was a little sleepy. Day 2 was rougher, and I think it was because I knew my drinking time are gone. It's the FOMO bells that was ringing in my brain. Day 3 was not great. At this point, generally, I drink whiskey during the evening to cut the week in half, but not this time.

Day 4 (yesterday) was a pain. I was very anxious. On every Fridays, my wife and I go to the restaurant, and most of the time, we choose the same place, with the same waitress. I always orders 3 glasses of red wine at front, so that she can enters them in my bill, and she brings me a fresh one as soon as I finish a cup! That's kinda terrible now that I think about it.

My wife treated herself with a cocktail, and then, I lied! I said: ""Oh, I have a terrible headache, I'll only have Pepsi tonight!"". The waitress - who knows me for two years now, was surprised! But hey, it worked. So, I was strong enough to resist, and I ordered a pop to treat myself, but in a soberly way. Back home, when I usually continue with some whiskey or scotch, I simply made a coffee, and hided in the basement to read *This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol* by Annie Grace and watched the movie *28 Days* with Sandra Bullock that I had never seen before (no joke).

The reason why I do these thing is simply that if I fail my sobriety, I don't want to face all the people that think I'm going sober. I'm afraid to fail so much. So, today, the lie continued. We went to the grocery, and I didn't buy my traditional 'Sunday bottle of wine', saying that I had two bottles at home (not true). I still have plenty of whisky, scotch and rum, but the wine was always a buy now/drink now kind of thing. Like an immature goof, I placed two **EMPTY** bottles in the wine cabinet, hoping that she doesn't mind touching them. And again, later today, we spent the afternoon in the pool. I usually have something alcoholic to drink, and I said that I don't want anything because I want to enjoy the pool without having to go out to pee. She still brought a cooler with a beer and a cocktail in a can, just in case. But I resisted (yay me!), and I feel like I‚Äôve crossed the ""need to drink"" threshold‚Äîthough I know it may not last.

Anyway, I plan to be honest in 2 weeks. We‚Äôre invited to a dinner at my in-laws‚Äô, and they‚Äôre heavy wine drinkers. I know I'll have to refuse many times their offer to drink wine. They just can't accept ""No"" for an answer. I already tried in the past, and they are very convincing. If they still insist, I know already that my plan will be to accept only a glass of wine, and I won't touch it for the whole evening.

I am **THAT** committed at the moment.

Wish me luck, and TIWNDWY!",2,1753567399.0,stopdrinking,0,0.75,False

Everything was going well when I got sick during our trip and it so happened my husband‚Äôs birthday fell during it. I‚Äôd been feeling sick but really struggled that morning. I made us late for our train (we got there 5 minutes before the train left) but my husband was upset he didn‚Äôt get coffee or a real breakfast before it (we did get a pastry and a bottled drink). It felt like he was annoyed with me all day since then. Then I mentioned to him that we leave our bags at the hotel and explore together. We finally grabbed some coffee and he was directing us to
The hotel when we realized we‚Äôd gone too far. He goes towards an information desk, when I tell him the entrance was behind us. Apparently I yelled at him, but I didn‚Äôt realize it. He lost it and yelled at me in public. I walked away and he apologized. He‚Äôd been trying to ask the attendant a question, but I hadn‚Äôt realized. We took some time to cool off and agreed it was a misunderstanding. 
Shortly after that, we‚Äôre exploring the city when he stops in the middle of the sidewalk, undoes his jeans, and adjusts his underwear, with people around. I asked him what he was doing and I apparently yelled again, although I just remember being annoyed asking him. He yelled at me again in front of everyone to stop giving him a hard time on his birthday and our honeymoon, telling me to leave him alone. I walked away and we both cooled off again. 
Later he texted me saying it was selfish and rude of me to get on him on his birthday, that I shouldn‚Äôt say anything. I told him it was creepy and gross to undo your pants in public even if no one was looking. 
He drank 5 glasses of wine and we headed to the hotel. We had reservations for dinner so we were showering and getting ready. He turns on the hair dryer, then starts to shave with an electric shaver, I noticed it was a little wet and didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd use it.

This past week I went on vacation.  I ate 3 times a day.  Sometimes more than that.  Always gorged.

Lots of steak, but I know that‚Äôs not that fatty.  And desserts every day.

I was expecting a significant weight gain.  Well, I was right.  In one week I gained 18 pounds.  But right after that I went back to my normal regimen.  By Friday I had lost 12 pounds.

I‚Äôm still in a 6 pound deficit, sure.  But that‚Äôs not that bad considering the wild week I had.  And the thousands upon thousands of calories I had.

WTAF lol,"I [58F] am replacing my car, a 15 yr old Sebring convertible. Yay me! I never want to drive anything other than a convertible again. I‚Äôve been eyeing Mazda Miatas for years: more moderately priced than other convertibles available, cheaper maintenance, top reliability. Still, it‚Äôs a sports car. My Sebring broke down and we found a used Miata MX-5 at a Ford dealership. Low mileage, 2019.

We spent lot of time with the sales lady. Super nice. Great sales lady. I told her the car is for me. She directed her attention to both me and DH but just to me for essentials like showing me the features and sending me on my test drive. Then asked me how I liked it. Never mentioned DH trying it out or asking his opinion.

Had to return for payment today. She handed us off to ‚ÄúJoe,‚Äù the finance guy. Two seats in front of his desk; the inner one, where I directed DH, was blocked by Joe‚Äôs computer screens. DH & Joe could only see the top of each other‚Äôs heads. I think you know where this is going. Although I‚Äôm the one mainly talking, even the inevitable sales people small talk, Joe‚Äôs directing most of his conversation and eye contact at DH. And DH is a shy man of few words. 

About 10 minutes in I say how it‚Äôs a new car for me to replace my ancient one. Joe: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs a surprise.‚Äù *Like, really‚ÄΩ* You‚Äôd think he‚Äôd have a light bulb go on then, but no. The only time I drew DH into the conversation was consulting on added warranties and such. Still, 75% of Joe‚Äôs attention was directed at DH, looking him in the eye. I even sent DH to get me more coffee to give Joe some time to buy a clue. Nope.

As I age I also get better at confrontation, so I returned to Joe‚Äôs office alone for a chat. I complemented him as a fun, engaging man, for his help with a sticky part of payment (he even had given me his cell number to call Monday), and some fantastic insurance advice he gave. Then I outlined the bad issue. I said I didn‚Äôt like that he assumed the car was for DH. That it‚Äôs *my car* and all *my money.* He denied the ownership assumption and said it was also a new office with the one monitor blocking someone so he tried to include DH. I graciously let him save some face. But I told him that women get this *all the time.* Happened recently to a friend buying a pickup. I said I understand that since it‚Äôs a sports car, and one many men buy for racing (Joe races cars himself), I get he might make an assumption. I told him it‚Äôs meant to be friendly, constructive criticism: never assume who was the buyer/main driver and direct his eyes and financial talk to the buyer. Women buy cars. And reminded him one last time that even when he knew it was my car, he engaged my DH and his eyes 75% of the time.

DH is the best but even at our age he‚Äôs still learning how us women view and interact with the world. He didn‚Äôt notice Joe‚Äôs inappropriate behavior but will see it now!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **San Francisco Giants vs. New York Mets: A Tale of Two Time Zones (and One Very Confused Bat)**

The San Francisco Giants (54-50) and New York Mets (60-44) collide on July 27, 2025, in a matchup that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúWorld Series preview‚Äù and more ‚Äútwo tired roommates arguing over the thermostat.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why this game might end with a pitcher asking, ‚ÄúWait, is it 2025 or 2023?‚Äù

---

### Parse the Odds: A Statistical Tango

The Mets, fresh off a five-game winning streak, are slight favorites at -102. That translates to a 50.5% implied probability‚Äîabout the same chance of correctly guessing a stranger‚Äôs favorite ice cream flavor on the first try. The Giants (+102) carry a 49.5% chance, which is statistically indistinguishable from a coin flip that‚Äôs had too much coffee.

Pitching? It‚Äôs a duel between **Robbie Ray** (Giants, 2.92 ERA, 9.6 K/9) and **David Peterson** (Mets, 2.90 ERA, 7.6 K/9). Their ERAs are so close, they‚Äôre basically twins who got into a ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs More Reliable?‚Äù debate and agreed to a tie. Ray‚Äôs strikeout rate gives him the edge in a chess match, but Peterson‚Äôs consistency (19 quality starts this season) is the kind of reliability you‚Äôd expect from a coffee maker, not a pitcher.

The Giants are 28-20 at home, thriving in Oracle Park‚Äôs hitter-friendly embrace like a surfer in a perfect wave. The Mets? A paltry 22-28 on the road, which is baseball‚Äôs version of a tourist who gets lost in every city.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Metaphors

The Giants are desperate to end a 3-7 skid, a slump so deep it makes their 28-10 record when out-hitting opponents feel like a mirage. Their offense? It‚Äôs the equivalent of a Wi-Fi signal that works only when you‚Äôre not looking. Star slugger **Joc Pederson** has been nursing a ‚Äúmysterious hamstring injury‚Äù that might‚Äôve started after he tried to catch a fly ball while juggling laundry.

1ma5gi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ma5gi0/aita_for_overlooking_my_best_friend_on_her/,AITA for overlooking my best friend on her birthday?,"Let me explain. And be patient- it's a long one.

I (22F) was recently the maid of honor of my friend's (21F) wedding. Our mutual bestie (23F) who I must admit, I am a little closer to, was also a bridesmaid. This was wedding week- Monday night, I got in from an unexpectedly cancelled flight around 10pm. I was supposed to get in that morning and have time to run errands, but that didn't happen. I stayed up pretty late getting my apartment ready for guests, but had work at 7:30a the next morning. Tuesday, bestie (birthday girl) comes in around noon when I'm still at work. I work till 5:30 and come home. Her birthday is the next day, and I can tell she's very upset because she isn't spending it with her family for the first time in her life. I empathize with her, but resolve to help her have a great birthday. Wednesday, I wake up at midnight to tell her happy birthday. I go to work at 7:30a (it was impossible for me to take it off), but Bride comes in around noon that day. I check in with bride throughout the day to see how bestie is doing, but it's not looking too hot. Bestie is still sad and doesn't want to do anything. I text bride that we are going to drag her out of the house because she can't be sad on her birthday! bride agrees.

I get home, bestie is still sad. We make her dress up, we all get ready, we drag her to her favorite restaurant and play birthday songs the whole way. We are belly laughing at this point. We have such a fun dinner, then I take us all to target to buy her favorite ice cream. Bride also picks up some stuff for the bachelorette, which is tomorrow. This is important. We head home, still belly laughing, then we eat our ice cream and watch a movie that bestie wanted to watch. laughed literally so hard! Throughout all the laughs, I could still tell that bestie was still a bit sad. I could understand, because not being around family really sucks on special occasions. she gets tired so she goes to bed first. Bride and I start getting my hair ready for my hair appointment in the morning. Thursday, bachelorette. All the bridesmaids come and stay in my studio apartment till Sunday (wedding day), but bestie stays an extra week. It was a very stressful week for me, but it was worth it giving bride the best day of her life.

Weddings over, and it's just me and bestie. the wedding ended around 11p on Sunday. We got home around midnight, I went to bed around 1a and had work the next morning. Everything is normal, but I am definitely feeling very stretched. I never fully recovered from traveling, let alone the wedding. I felt very bad because at this point, bestie had nobody's car she could borrow and was home alone (with not too much food left in the fridge). I asked what she wanted for dinner, and she said she didn't care. She offered to put in a target order that I could pick up on my way back from work. I said perfect, and Venmoed her double the price of the groceries. After work I head to target, but she had put in the order immediately when I got off work, meaning it'd take another hour. She calls and tells me this, suggesting I should just come home and pick up the groceries tomorrow since I had just worked a 10 hour shift the day after the wedding. I said I'd stay because I felt bad that I didn't have food in my fridge. She responds with, ""Yeah. we need to work on your hosting skills.""

That hurt me so much, because I truly take pride in being a good host. She knows that too, so it felt like a dig. I told her that I felt her comment was a bit mean. She responds, ""I was kidding. I mean, I could be paying for a hotel right now so I shouldn't complain."" That didn't make me feel any better, because I felt like she was saying I'm just a step up from a hotel. I stopped talking, and eventually just told her id wait for the food, and she hung up. I sobbed in my car, because the weight of the past 2 weeks just hit me. I wasn't upset with her, that comment was just the straw that broke the camels back.

an hour later, I wipe any evidence of tears and go inside with the food. I smile and say hi, and she says hi pretty sheepishly. I guess my eyes were still a bit red, because she kept asking me what was wrong. I said nothing, but she asked me enough times that I got overwhelmed and just told her everything- but I EMPHASIZED how I wasn't sad over her comment, it was just that her comment was what sent me over the edge. she was pretty sad over it, so I asked if she wanted to go to her favorite coffee shop in the city. She wasn't looking at me anymore and just replied Sure, whatever. I was confused, because now she was mad at me?

We get to the coffee shop, and I ask what she wanted. She said nothing, which then got me confused because I came for her? We had been trying to go there for a week, and suddenly she wants nothing. I get a drink, sit down, and ask her what's up.

To make this long story a little briefer, she said she didn't feel appreciated on her birthday. ATP it was almost a week ago, but I genuinely heard her out. She said she wasn't just sad because of her parents, she was sad because bride and I didn't ""show up"" for her, and she felt terrible. she said people who were calling her were asking if we forgot it was her birthday because of how negligent we were acting. I felt terrible, and I told her if I could do it all again that I would've called in sick to work. She said it wasn't about that, because her parents would've worked too. She said she felt ""overshadowed by what was to come"", referring to bride's bachelorette party and wedding. She said she wanted our undivided attention on her birthday, but she felt like we weren't just celebrating her- we were celebrating her and bride, and that ""you only turn 23 once"". 

I validated her feelings, saying that she shouldn't have to share attention on her birthday and that was completely on me. I said yes, my attention was divided and that I was so sorry. After that, she kept digging into me over and over and over again until I was literally sobbing and we had to leave the coffee shop. It was only then that she said it was okay and we made up. Then she was magically cheery again.

I was relieved then, but looking back it just doesn't feel right. why did she only bring this up after I had told her she had hurt me? AND how was it my fault that she felt bad on her birthday, when she was already in a bad mood when she came in on Tuesday? and why did she keep up her bad mood when we dragged her to dinner or made her join us for ice cream? It just felt like she had made up her mind that she wouldn't be happy, no matter what we would have done. At the coffee shop, I asked her what the ideal day would have been or what more we could have done. She kept saying, ""I don't know. something."" and actually, I don't know if I believe a birthday is an excuse to be inconsiderate. yes, you only turn 23 once, but you have a birthday every year? You only get married once! EVER! 

I feel like I was gaslit a bit, though I still know she isn't completely wrong. I wish I could have done more, but I genuinely didn't have any more to give. I was surprised the bachelorette went well, given that I had no time to set it up with my flight being cancelled.

Now, I just don't know what to do. Bestie has moved on, bride doesn't know, but it's just been pestering me in my soul the past few days. I don't even know who's right and who's wrong. So, AITAH?",2,1753566906.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

He has no credit history (not bad, just never got a credit card and no student loans or car loan) and I have very good credit. I'm trying to figure out best credit card for him given what I already have. I may also downgrade my CSR as well, because I think with baby our travel and restaurant usage will go way down. Goals are to build credit and select joint card for us - can be one or more cards. We have different last names so not sure if adding him as authorized user on my account will help him get approved later.

Current cards, all mine:
-Chase Sapphire Reserve, opened 9/2018, CL $21K
---Use for travel, restaurants, coffee shops, gas, misc purchases, will have $550 annual fee for one more year
-Prime Visa, opened 11/2019, CL $8300
---use for Amazon, Whole Foods (closest grocery store), no annual fee
-Bank of America cash rewards, opened ~2011, CL $2500, no annual fee
---use for 3% online shopping rewards, 2% grocery rewards at Costco and TJs, rare Target shopper
-Banana Republic card, opened ~2012, CL $3300
---use for credit history and Old Navy clothing

FICO Score: 800-something is mine, not sure what his is but he got declined for Chase Freedom even though we opened joint checked account with $5K in it to start

Oldest account (his): no accounts, no student loans. My oldest account is from 2011.

Chase status: no credit cards for him, my last chase card was opened in 2019

Income: 175K single income post baby

Avg monthly spend (joint expenses):
Baby is arriving soon and we are moving to single income, so estimated some lower for the future:
Groceries, diapers, home supplies: $1000, mostly TJs, Costco, whole foods
Restaurants and coffee shops: $400 (down from $600-$700), maybe down even further for first six months but maybe replaced with delivery
Clothing: $200 (down from $300-$400), mostly online Poshmark eBay Thredup Old Navy
Gas: ~$150 + $70 tolls
Comcast: $200
Travel: maybe $3-$4k in flights a year for near future? Hard to know, but imagining at least two trips to see family across the country. Have $900 in travel points on CSR right now
Media subscriptions: $100/month (streaming, substack)
Entertainment: $100/month (tickets, museum memberships, etc)
Personal care: $50, mostly from Amazon, maybe some Target or Sephora

PGE Utilities are $300/month but I think there's a fee to run through a credit card.

Biz Card? I don't think so?

Purpose of next card: build husbands credit + possibly tweak card mix for more local grocery and diapers heavy life vs historical restaurant+travel+Uber heavy life. Would be nice to have one joint account card long term for groceries diapers gas subscriptions but doesn't need to be right away.

Cards looking at? I was hoping he'd qualify for Chase Freedom Unlimited but no dice. I may apply for it since I saw a good bank branch exclusive deal for it when we opened our joint account, and I'm not sure CSR will be worth it for me going forward - just haven't figured out how to transfer travel points or whether to ask for retention bonus. I need to renew my TSA pre check too, and I'm sure we will be ordering delivery more with a baby. Given that, I was thinking maybe Amazon secured or Chase Rise. Capital One Savor Student would be great if they don't need confirmation he's a student ü§î.

I feel like one strategy is to authorize him on my cards, and get him a secured card we just put a small number of recurring subscriptions on, and he builds credit for 12 months and then we get him an actually useful rewards card. Another option is find a rewards card he qualifies for and just start using that for all relevant joint expenses categories. Are there other strategies I should be considering? Any suggestions for cards or nuance within either strategy? Thank you!

My wife and I are living together with our two kids and the past two years or so have been challenging for us family wise. First of all, my side of the family is very small due to family issues that happened in the distant past. It means that all the family I have contact with is my grandfather (grandmother as well but she passed away a few years ago) an aunt and her daughter, but mainly my grandfather. And regarding my own parents: my mother passed away (illness) and I've never had any real contact with my father because my parents got divorced when I was one.

So that covers my side, for my wife's side: she's the daughter of an immigrant who came here (Europe) in the 70s for work. He and his wife got 3 kids, all were born here, but no further family here. About two years ago they decided to move back to their home country. Their youngest son was already living there, he stayed there after studying at uni there and so my wife and her older brother were the ones still here. And now they've persuaded the oldest son to move back as well, which was an easy decision because he met his wife there and they were already debating either coming here or going there. Eventually it was an easy decision for him to go back, as it was also his duty as eldest son to take care of his parents when they get old.

So that leaves my wife with no family, me with an aunt and niece I see twice a year on average and my grandfather who I really have a good connection with and visit 1-2x a month, but he's getting really old and most likely doesn't have many years left in him.

On top of that about 4 years ago we decided to move from a big city to a village. Part of us wanted to get away from the rush of a big city, but since we also didn't really have a lot of reasons in terms of practicality or work to stay in the city, the bigger house and garden was of course attractive as well. We assumed living in a greener area, in small-ish village, would mean we'd be happier, less stressed and would possibly mean people in the village would be more of a close-knit community that looks after each other. Well, that's partly right, but the community is also quite closed we've come to experience. Very difficult to get any meaningful connections in. We do talk to neighbours but it never gets beyond a small chat. It's probably at least partly because we're quite introverted people, but even in periods where we'd really try, it doesn't happen. We've also encountered very weird behaviour with some people. For example: parents from a classmate of our oldest son once came up to us all cheerful and talked to us at an event for school, we came back home and we're happy that we had such a good talk for about half an hour. But the next time: not even a hi, nothing. And ever since it's just sometimes they greet us, and we've even approached them for a small chat a few times but we could feel in their energy and short answers that they were suddenly different and it felt as if they rather not talk.

So actually we're torn what to do. Part of us wants to go back to the city where we lived before, but we also left for reasons (mainly how busy it is and how at times unsafe the neighbourhoods were becoming). At the same time we can't connect with people in the village and its surroundings, maybe its us but we never had this issue with people in the city. We never had really deep relationships either, but good enough with some to visit each other sometimes and meet for a coffee or whatever. None of that over here. And on top of that: we have almost no family left.

What about friends you say? Well, since we're introverted persons we never had many. I have 2 good friends from high school and my wife has 4 good friends from university but all have their own families as well and we've come to experience that in our 30s it became much less an option to actually meet. Everybody's busy and most people we know have bigger families so they're much busier than we are. We do meet, but that's like once a month that one of us meets with someone and 1-2x a year that friends that have become mutual friends either come over or we visit them and have a great time. But they also live very scattered throughout the country.

All in all we find it difficult to really find our place in the world, because of all of the above we don't feel connected to a certain place because wherever we are, there's at best 1 friend or family member living there.

Part of us wants to emigrate as well, we have an extremely good connection with my wife's family and they're honestly the greatest people I know. But that would mean for both of us leaving all our friends behind and at our age, being introverted and in a new country (that my wife is from but we've never lived there, which is outside of Europe by the way so far away) makes making new friends really difficult. Maybe through our kids but they're also getting older, both are in their early teens, so hardly have to bring them to school or sports anymore anyway. Meaning that social connection gets watered down quickly as well.

Part of us wants to go back to the city (any city) or just double down on our current location and buy a house really in the forest (we've always dreamed of living in a forest), but part of us also fears of becoming too isolated.

While we don't blame my wife's family, we do feel that everything was much easier and much happier for us when they were still living here. Everyone's choosing their own path and rightfully so, but due to the above combination of factors, this leaves us quite empty-handed. We don't feel at home here, emigrating is difficult and would mean leaving all of our friends behind, but while we did feel at home with the people in the bigger city, going back is actually both difficult because of house pricing and also because there are still elements we don't like about that.

And now we have less and less family to discuss this with, so I really feel I should start somewhere. Just go get ideas, to see if we're really in such a rare and strange situation or if more people are dealing with these family issues and feelings of what to do, where you belong and so on.

TL;DR: Family from wife has emigrated, leaving us as a family with two teens, quite lonely and not in a happy place at the moment, also not knowing what to do after having moved to a village a few years ago. Do we emigrate as well for my wife's family? Do we move back to the city for more social contacts and a few friends of us? Or do we do something else?

Any advice or words of encouragement are welcome. I just had to get this off my chest and hopefully we'll be getting some ideas out of this. Thanks for reading all of this.",1,1753566126.0,family,1,1.0,False

# Soteria Review: Cutting-Edge AI Website Security Technology Instantly Scans, Detects & Fixes Malware, Bots & Hacker Threats in 60 Seconds Without the Tech Headaches!

# Part 1: The Digital Anxiety: Understanding the Modern Website Owner's Core Problem

**The Unspoken Fear of Hitting Refresh**

There is a moment that every person who runs a website knows well. It‚Äôs that slight, almost imperceptible pause you take right before your own site loads. In that split second, a dozen questions flash through your mind. Is it up? Is it slow? Does it look the way it‚Äôs supposed to? It‚Äôs a quiet, private anxiety, but it‚Äôs real. This feeling isn‚Äôt about technology; it‚Äôs about something far more personal. It‚Äôs the fear of losing your hard work, your digital storefront, and the trust you‚Äôve built with your audience.

If you‚Äôre a small business owner, a freelance marketer, or the head of a small agency, your website is more than just code and images. It‚Äôs the manifestation of your ideas, your late nights, and your professional reputation. You‚Äôve invested time, money, and a piece of yourself into creating this space online. The integrity of that space is directly tied to your sense of security and your ability to earn a living.

The central issue we all face today is this: while setting up a website has become more accessible than ever, protecting it has morphed into a silent, ongoing struggle. We are not just defending against mischievous teenagers in basements anymore. We are up against automated, intelligent threats that operate around the clock, searching for any weakness.

**The Reality of Digital Threats in 2025**

Let‚Äôs talk about the real concerns, the ones that keep you up at night. What happens if your customer's private information is stolen from your site? The damage to your reputation could be irreversible. What if Google blacklists your domain because it‚Äôs been compromised? Your traffic, the lifeblood of your online presence, would vanish overnight. Or what if you wake up one morning, grab your coffee, and load your homepage only to find it replaced with a hacker‚Äôs message?

The nature of cyberattacks has changed. It's no longer just individual hackers looking for a challenge. The modern threat is an army of AI-powered bots that constantly scan the internet, testing millions of websites a day for vulnerabilities. They are tireless, automated, and incredibly efficient. The statistic that over 30,000 websites are compromised daily isn‚Äôt just a number; it represents thousands of people like you whose digital livelihoods are disrupted.

The cost of a security breach goes far beyond fixing the technical problem. For a small business, the average financial fallout can exceed $120,000, a sum that can be devastating. This figure includes lost revenue, recovery costs, and potential fines. But the unquantifiable cost is the erosion of customer trust. Once that trust is broken, it can take months or even years to rebuild, if it can be rebuilt at all. Recovery is a long and arduous process, assuming you have the resources to even attempt it.

**The Cycle of Inadequate Solutions**

If you‚Äôve been running a website for any length of time, you‚Äôve likely been on a frustrating quest for a security solution. The journey probably looks something like this.

First, you might have tried a security plugin. You install it, open the dashboard, and are met with a wall of settings, acronyms, and alerts that you don‚Äôt fully grasp. You are left wondering if you‚Äôve configured it correctly or if it‚Äôs even doing its job.

Next, you might have considered hiring a professional. You search for a reliable freelancer, but the quotes come back in the thousands of dollars, far more than your budget allows for what feels like an invisible service.

Finally, you might just rely on the security offered by your hosting provider. While better than nothing, this is often a basic level of protection. It‚Äôs designed to protect the server, not necessarily the intricate details of your specific website. Sophisticated malware or application-level attacks can often slip through these general defenses.

This cycle leaves many website owners in a state of perpetual uncertainty. The available options often feel like a compromise. They are either too technical for the average user, too expensive for a small business, or too incomplete to provide genuine peace of mind. There is a clear gap for a solution that is understandable, affordable, and truly comprehensive.

# Part 2: Soteria: A Comprehensive Answer to Digital Security and a Business Opportunity

**Introducing Soteria: Your Proactive Digital Guardian**

Soteria is presented as a different approach to website security. It‚Äôs not just another tool or plugin to add to your collection. It is designed to be a complete security suite, powered by artificial intelligence, that actively detects threats, protects your digital assets, and helps you fix issues in real time.

The core idea behind it is to shift the user‚Äôs posture from one of reactive panic to one of proactive protection. Instead of scrambling to fix a hack after it has happened, Soteria aims to work quietly in the background, neutralizing threats before they can cause damage. This approach is meant to provide website owners with the mental space to concentrate on what they do best: running their business, creating content, or serving their clients.

The system was developed by Misan Morrison and Godswill Okoyomon. They are described as experienced developers who faced the same security frustrations as their users. They intimately understood the pain points of managing websites in a hostile digital environment. They built Soteria to be the solution they wished they had for themselves and their clients, one that combines robust protection with user-friendliness.

**My Personal Case Study as a Beta Tester**

As someone who manages a handful of small websites for clients, I was part of the beta testing group for Soteria. My biggest constant was a low-level anxiety about the security of these sites. I was using a couple of well-known plugins, but I never felt completely confident that they were catching everything.

Setting up Soteria was surprisingly straightforward. I connected the client sites to the dashboard without any technical roadblocks. The interface was clean and I didn't need to dig through documentation to figure out what to do.

I ran the initial scan on one of the sites, a small e-commerce store. I wasn't expecting it to find much, as I kept the plugins and theme updated. To my surprise, the scan flagged a vulnerability in a seemingly inactive piece of code left over from a previous developer. It was a backdoor that other security plugins had completely missed. The system guided me through neutralizing the threat.

The real change for me was the feeling after the initial setup. Seeing the 24/7 monitoring active and knowing that the AI was watching for threats gave me a sense of confidence I hadn't had before. It shifted my relationship with my clients. I was no longer just the person who did maintenance; I was their security partner. This experience showed me the value of a proactive and comprehensive system.

**Soteria‚Äôs Edge Over the Competition**

When comparing Soteria to other security solutions, like the popular Wordfence plugin, a few key differences stand out. Wordfence is an excellent tool for securing a WordPress site, but its focus is primarily on protection.

Soteria aims to be more of an all-in-one platform. It is both a security tool and a business-building tool. The ""agency-in-a-box"" model is a significant differentiator. Features like the built-in client finder, the white-label reporting, and the reseller rights are not typically found in standard security plugins. These features transform the product from a defensive utility into a potential revenue stream. It's not just about protecting your own assets; it‚Äôs about having the ability to monetize that protection as a service for others.

I've got her permission and let her proofread this whole thing before posting it. She likes the idea of getting objective opinions and answers since everyone in her life is biased towards her happiness. But she's never used reddit, so I thought I'd help her out.

SO...there's a lot of context that needs to be laid out here cuz...hoo boy......My mom met her husband and my stepdad (let's call him Albert) in 2005 and have been married since 2009. A 20-year relationship. Albert has been in my life since I was 10 years old and I've been around to witness his mistreatment of Mom this whole time. Mom and I are EXTREMELY close. She's truly my best friend and I hers. We share our entire lives with each other and have been each other‚Äôs rocks for truly as long as I can remember. So not only have I seen all the crap that's gone down between her and Albert, but she also confides in me regarding all the crap that goes down behind closed doors.

Some examples of his emotional abuse:

* **You‚Äôre unlovable!** My mom has some weight on her, it‚Äôs true and Albert has openly called Mom out on it, especially with the weight she's gained back throughout the years. When Albert and Mom first got together, one of his opening lines was, ""You just better not gain all your weight back"". But she did. The punishment has been no physical contact for over 15 years, i.e., refusing almost all physical interactions (e.g., kisses, backrubs, sex, hugs, etc.). The only way Mom gets a hug from Albert is if she hugs him. And Mom has told me she can feel him pulling away. Albert has mentioned many times over the years that he‚Äôs not into ‚Äúbig‚Äù women‚Äù and big women are ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù. He‚Äôs never said, ‚ÄúYou are disgusting‚Äù, but still‚Ä¶ message received. I think any kind person can imagine how those messages can stick and make someone like Mom feel awful about herself ‚Äì completely unlovable.
* **You‚Äôre worthless!** Albert makes Mom feel worthless in a variety of ways, as with the weight gain. He erodes her self-esteem by ignoring her when she‚Äôs talking to him; like completely ignoring her and then making excuses as to why he wasn‚Äôt responding. Doing it once is one thing, but doing it all the time is degrading. The real message is that she‚Äôs not worth listening to. And he gets angry when she misses a detail in a tv show their watching‚Ä¶ angry to the point where he makes her feel so stupid that she cries. That‚Äôs happened many times. He just intentionally makes her feel stupid. It‚Äôs his way of controlling her emotions and keeping her in line. He‚Äôs sent so many negative messages through the years, over and over again, that I think he might have her believing they‚Äôre true.
* **Your boundaries don‚Äôt count!** Mom hates discussing politics, with Albert. They used to share the same views, but over time, Albert's opinions have changed while Mom‚Äôs haven‚Äôt. Mom has stated multiple times in multiple ways that she wants nothing to do with political videos, podcasts, news, or anything of the sort, but Albert still adamantly shares these things with Mom and acts surprised when she gets upset, sometimes getting properly angry when Mom refuses to partake or shares (in any way) her disapproval. His comments are, ‚ÄúYou should be interested in these conversations that are going on all around you. You‚Äôre so clueless about what‚Äôs going on in the world.‚Äù Mom‚Äôs not clueless, she just doesn‚Äôt share the same views, so discussing it with Albert is painful.
* **You can‚Äôt make decisions!** Albert doesn‚Äôt believe Mom is capable of making important decisions. She‚Äôs advised Albert about life changing events, e.g., not to buy the big, expensive house; not to do things that will injure his body; how to handle back-taxes; and that he should show more support and kindness to his step-kids. And every time, Mom finds herself saying, ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôd just listened to me‚Ä¶.‚Äù But he won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ and he won‚Äôt give her the satisfaction of saying, ‚ÄúHoney, you were right.‚Äù Instead, he twists these events into some version where Mom was at fault. The result is a Mom who lives in fear of speaking her mind and offering up solutions to anyone. She feels like no one would care about her opinions anyway.
* **Do you feel guilty? Good!** Albert basically guilts Mom any chance he gets, e.g., spending extra time with my sister and me, where he‚Äôs not invited; spending money on a getaway trip; being noisy in the kitchen with my sister and me while cooking a family meal; sleeping in on the weekend; and; ordering-out instead of eating in (like Albert‚Äôs going to cook for her‚Ä¶? Never, not once in 21 years!). The list goes on and on. If Albert doesn‚Äôt get to be the center of attention during the activity, he‚Äôs not happy, and here comes the guilt!
* **Be quiet and listen. I‚Äôm talking!** Albert properly doesn't understand what a conversation is! Now I know this one sounds like I'm just bitching, but seriously, Albert‚Äôs idea of a conversation is, ""I'm going to sit an educate you on how air conditioners work... don't interrupt me... don't ask questions unless they pertain to air conditioners...don't walk away from our \*conversation\* to grab something (like a paper towel to wipe up spilled coffee) or I'll visibly get pissed off. And don't try to respond or add anything because I obviously know everything about air conditioners...you don't... so how could you possibly add anything of value!"" Mom just listens to the monologue, stays quiet, and smiles when it‚Äôs over.
* **I'm a narcissist‚Ä¶ so what?** Albert is very intelligent, and he knows it. He is also a narcissist and needs to be stroked constantly.‚Äî no joke! Narcissists need their self-esteem fed to them from external sources and Albert gets his strokes from people (Mom especially) telling him how smart he is. If Mom doesn‚Äôt stroke him, first he pouts, then he starts to dig his heels in. Mom is told she‚Äôs ‚Äúmean‚Äù, she doesn‚Äôt care about him, she‚Äôs being ‚Äúrude‚Äù, she‚Äôs ‚Äúdebasing‚Äù him‚Ä¶ the slurs go on and on. If Mom doesn‚Äôt quickly make him feel special, he‚Äôll be sure to make her feel worse than he does.
* **Love language is BS!** Albert tries to show Mom love by buying her things or doing this for her when she doesn't ask. This isn't Mom's love language. She doesn't care about material things at all and she doesn‚Äôt like being doted over. And she‚Äôs told him that. But God forbid, if Mom doesn't show immense gratitude when he gives her something or does something for her‚Ä¶ she‚Äôd better just say, ""Thank you!!! Oh my God! I've never told you I wanted this but now that you've given it to me, you're the most AMAZING husband, what would I EVER do without you?""... for the $180 pair of hand-crafted scissors from Poland she never asked for... And if Mom is honest with Albert about how she feels‚Ä¶ oof‚Ä¶ his response would be...""Geez, that was mean. I did something nice for you‚Ä¶ I get so many nice things for you. You don‚Äôt appreciate anything I do.‚Äù He‚Äôs so well versed in making Mom feel properly guilty. He knows how to get her to overcompensate, so ultimately, he gets what he needed anyway.
* **Why should I respect you?** An obvious one: Albert doesn't respect her in any way. Mom is a very creative person. She loves pottery and art, most things made with the hands, is very spiritual, believing in energies and stuff like that. When it comes down to it, she just wants to be helpful. She‚Äôs generally a happy person who wants to smile and help others to smile. But Albert openly makes her feel ashamed for being interested in basically anything that isn't based in logic or academics. If the thing isn't ""intellectually stimulating"", it's frivolous, silly, not worth anyone's time, and doesn't matter. He‚Äôs told Mom that he‚Äôs disappointed in her for losing her thirst for learning. Mom likes to learn ‚Äì just not what he wants her to learn.

I could drive this bullet list into the ground but for the sake of character-count...I'll just say...if there's a red flag, he's waving it...

Alright, so I know I'm writing this from a harsh stance and I'm sure I sound like I'm just looking for validation on how angry I am with Albert. But this isn't just me, I promise. Everyone sees it: my sister, my fianc√©, my brother-in-law, my in-laws, and my extended family. Anyone remotely close to Mom has seen it. Mom has gone to therapy for these Albert-stemmed issues and has always been told the same thing: You don't belong together. You two are just not compatible.

Albert is a ""covert narcissist"", which basically means he's a joy to be around by anyone other than who has to live with him or have an actual relationship with him. He was severely mistreated as a kid, which is awful. I truly do feel horrible for him about his heinous upbringing. He didn't receive ANY love AT ALL in his formative years. This manifested into him becoming an insecure manchild as an adult. He feeds off validation from everyone around him and tries to fill a massive void by controlling his loved ones. Albert couldn‚Äôt be more insecure, so he forces anyone around him, Mom, coworkers, grocery store clerks, off-encounters ‚Äì ANYONE ‚Äì to show him validation and respect, even if it means belittling and bullying them.

WE ALL KNOW Albert is a narcissist. And so does he‚Ä¶ Mom told him (atta-girl!!). He was hurt by the accusation but was also kind of weirdly receptive to it. He always tries to make changes, says he'll do things differently, but in the end, he never does. I believe Albert wants to be better and I think he does love my mom is some weird, twisted way that makes sense to him. But I truly don't think he's capable of loving in the way that my Mom needs.

So, that brings me to all the good things about Albert that Mom always falls back on. I think she realizes that there truly aren't many good things‚Ä¶ .But it's true that Mom has lived in financial comfort for 20 years. And that was wholly because of Albert in the beginning. Mom was pretty darn poor when she was raising me as a single mother, before she met Albert. It was hard times and Albert pulled her out of it. He paid off her debt, bought a million-dollar home (that she didn't ask for but, you know...a 180-degree turnaround from the tiny apartment we lived in). He really did financially support her in a way she never could have dreamed of. That is to say...Albert really holds this over Mom. When Mom turned 40, she went back to college. Albert wanted her to get a nursing degree. Mom wanted a Health Science degree. She‚Äôll never live that one down, with his comments about how much money she‚Äôd be making if she stuck out the nursing degree.

Never mind that Mom is thrilled with her choice. Now Mom has a great job making great money as a career driven lady. Albert never did validate her choice and even holds it over Mom that she ""took too long and spent too much money to get her degree"" and it was ""a financial disaster"". 

It's a common, recurring theme. I say, ""Mom, you really need to leave Albert. You make a good salary for where we live (around $100,000/yr). You would be happier without him"". Then Mom says, ""I know, I really know...but he's done so much for me.‚Äù And, ‚ÄúA lot of things he bitches about are true...I promised I wouldn't gain my weight back, and I did.‚Äù And also, ‚ÄúHe relies on me for so much around the house and the yard.‚Äù And don‚Äôt forget, ‚ÄúHe loves little Boston (Mom‚Äôs dog) to death. I can‚Äôt take Boston away from him!‚Äù And then there‚Äôs, ‚ÄúI don't know how he would take care of himself without me.‚Äù And finally, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel so, so guilty for just leaving him high and dry. I can't be that selfish!""

So, all that is to say... she knows. Mom knows how bad it is. She knows she‚Äôs ‚Äúone of those women who stay when they shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù. She's had an entire half of her immediate family being like...Mom, why are you doing this to yourself? And I truly believe it's because Albert has chipped away at her self-esteem for 20 years, making her feel worthless, unlovable, like she deserves the bullshit he constantly dishes out. I think she's scared of being alone as a 56-year-old, heavy-set lady. And any time I say, ""You never know, you might meet an amazing golden bachelor someday"" she scoffs andsays something to the effect of how ugly and fat she is.

It genuinely breaks my heart, because she is...amazing. She's managed to financially and emotionally support me (a disabled chronic pain patient) for a decade...while also dealing with Albert. She's kind and stable, smart and funny. She's gorgeous at any goddamn weight and I don't think she'll ever believe it if she's under Albert's scrutiny.

So reddit, my God, this is long post, I'm sorry. I really just need advice to relay to Mom on how to beat back this guilt she's wracked with. She's just stuck on this idea that she's being horribly selfish by leaving. She's taught herself to believe a lot of Albert's bullshit. And it's very, very, very, hard for her to just throw it aside and say, ""I'll do this for myself because I deserve it"". I don't think she believes she deserves it.

How do we help Mom believe she deserves it?

Thanks everyone <3

  
TLDR: My mom has suffered intense emotional abuse for 20 years. She doesn't know how to beat her guilt over leaving him. Her self esteem is non-existent and I need help on how to convince her that she's not being selfish.",1,1753565962.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

1ma4z2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1ma4z2h/is_peeing_a_lot_nerves_diuretics_etc_bad_for_food/,"Is peeing a lot (nerves, diuretics, etc...) bad for food or medicine absorption?","I know water doesn't go directly to your bladder. It has to enter your bloodstream which means any food or liquid you drink is absorbed and once into you bloodstream passes to the bladder.

The thing is, when you are exposed to cold weather, or when you feel nervous, or when take diuretics, etc...you pee more; even if you barely take any liquids. For example, if you drink a small cup of coffee you'll pee the same Asia you drink, let's say, a full glass of water. In the same way, if you're nervous waiting for a phone call or a job interview, you are more likely to pee more often...and no, I' not talking about that syndrome where people go very often to the toilet and barely pee, because their bladder isn't emptied when they have a wee...I'm talking about peeing a lot, like more than what you've drunk.

  
Questions:

1- if you have barely drunk then you are constantly peeing, where is that water coming from? Is from the water reserves we have distributed all over our body, like body fat? I mean, we have water all over (muscles, skin, etc...)

2-When that happens (peeing more frequently than you should), are you ""accelerating"" the excretion of substances that weren't properly digested/absorbed yet? For example, if you take an aspirin and sit and relax vs you take an aspirin and feel nervous and pee a lot, does the latter mean the aspirin will be absorbed poorly? 

I mean, if you eat lots of fiber, that accelerated your digestion, which in principle is healthy as it helps the stool move along the intestines; but we also have the case of laxatives, where food digestion is accelerated which can result in less absorption of macro and micronutrients.

IMPORTANT: Not talking about any bladder or prostate conditions. Talking about peeing more volume than water you are consuming through food or drinks.

**Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie, But They Do Suggest Mariners Will Win**  
The Seattle Mariners (-151) are the clear favorites against the Los Angeles Angels (+235), implying bookmakers give Seattle a **\~60% chance to win** and LA a paltry **\~30%**. Those numbers aren‚Äôt just math‚Äîthey‚Äôre a middle finger to the Angels‚Äô 49-54 record. Seattle‚Äôs 54.5% winning percentage when favored? That‚Äôs the reliability of a coffee shop that actually opens on time. The Angels‚Äô 46.2% underdog win rate, meanwhile, is about as useful as a third-base coach in a chess match.

The game‚Äôs total is set at **9 runs**, and both teams rank in the MLB‚Äôs upper half for scoring. The Mariners‚Äô Cal Raleigh, chasing his 40th home run, has already blasted 39‚Äîenough to wallpaper a small apartment. The Angels‚Äô Taylor Ward (23 HRs) is no slouch either, but let‚Äôs be real: Ward‚Äôs exit velocity against Seattle‚Äôs George Kirby might as well be a garden snail racing a Prius.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Rivalries, and Why the Angels Are Basically a Reality TV Show**  
The Mariners are relatively healthy, though one wonders if Cal Raleigh‚Äôs quest for 40 HRs has caused his legs to atrophy from all the celebratory backflips.

1ma4sh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1ma4sh5/hello_everyone_therapy_brought_me_here/,Hello everyone!  Therapy brought me here,"Well, not specifically to this sub.    

This is sort of an introduction post.  I wanted to say hello to everyone and share my history..  I hope your post-adventist journey has been one of healing and heading in a positive direction. 



I am/was a 3rd generation Adventist.  Both my parents were adventist, and their parents as well.  We grew up under the umbrella of the spanish version of adventism.  What is spanish adventism?  You see, spanish adventism (\*\*EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE VIEW\*\*) is Adventists that adhere to the 27 fundamental beliefs with a heavy leaning into prophecy and the strict interpretation of Ellen White writings.  Not just her greatest hits (Great Controversy and Desire of Ages),  but also her smaller publications, private letters, etc.   

We were very strict sabbath keepers, with sabbath-only recreation, somewhat normal on the dress code, clean-meat only, and no substances.  Both my parents followed the rules meticulously.  My mother also followed the character, meaning she strived to be more christ-like.  My father, on the other hand, followed the strict policies, but would twist scripture to support his views.  He used this to subjugate my mother.  He would also hit her, and sometimes us.  Mostly her, because of how submissive she was.  I am 99.9% positive he has a mental disorder, but he refuses to get any sort of evaluation or treatment.  Just denial.  I can recall my mom and the 4 of us kids going to the women's shelter, thankfully only 3 times that I can remember.  I also recall the bitter disappointment every time she would forgive him and we would head back home.  I think the craziest thing in hindsight was although my dad didn't drink or abuse substances,  my upbringing felt more like someone raised in an alcoholic household.  Anyways, back to the legalism.

Our piety routine was Friday vespers, Saturday first service, Sabbath school, main service, potluck/random church member's house for lunch,  eventide, occasional Sat night social, Wednesday evening church, rinse-repeat.  Weekdays we would have morning devotional. I think later on we switched to evening devotionals , then stopped altogether as we got older.   It was extra fun when prophecy seminars were in town.  We would spend every night there too.   This was our routine, every week, every year.

I remember growing up with all sorts of internalized fear and panic.  As a kid, I was very introverted and 'weird'.  Because of that, my dad would frequently have outbursts that were directed towards me.  I was always afraid of him, and he could sense it.   One time when he and my mom were having a fight, I was afraid (7 at the time) to walk behind him, and went the long way around the long table to get a plate.  He took notice and proceeded to pick me up and throw me down the hall and spank me.  I still don't know why he did that.  That was my vision of God the Father.  Abusive, hateful, vindictive, and ready to kill anyone who didn't agree with him.  My mother was my vision of Jesus.  Gentle lamb, unconditional love, sweet, kindest person I have ever met, even to this day.  My dad's pure evil never made any sense to me.  He was very devout, reading the stupid quarterly every morning, taking his vitamins and 'postum', a spanish decaf type coffee.  Is this was God was like?  I didn't know any better.  

In addition to the physical and mental abuse of my dad, we also had plenty of spiritual abuse heaped onto our collective fear.  The End Times were a constant discussion in our household.  We knew that Jesus was coming soon, and all sorts of crazy shit was going to happen.  There would be people sending us to torture chambers to get us to renounce the sabbath.  We would live in the mountains.  Jacob's Time of Trouble.  In addition to what was typically taught, we also had weird folklore sprinkled in from my parent's ancestral homes.  My mom has all sorts of crazy stories of witch ladies who could transform into spiders, or tales of the Ouija board.  My dad swears he saw a mysterious dark figure try to assault him in the middle of the night.  My sister says she saw Christ nailed on the cross and looking at her in disappointment one night because she was listening to Enya music.  To say we believed in the supernatural would be an understatement.  We lived the supernatural.  I was constantly afraid of becoming demon-possessed, or watching the wrong shows and becoming spiritually assaulted, or going to movie theatres and no longer being under the angels protection.  Oh, and did you all know that if your room is messy, God's angels cant come in?  

Relief from this chaos came in the way of boarding school.  You see, my eldest sister, naturally, became rebellious.  She had a big bad boyfriend, and my dad couldn't handle that.  So he sent her to an adventist school her senior year to 'protect' her.  I remember us driving all the way up there to drop her off.  It was an all day drive.  The school actually looked like paradise in comparison to home!  Dorms, cafe food, peers everywhere!  It was my escape!  After we dropped her off, it was maybe a week later that I begged to go too.  It was my chance to get away from my dad.  So I enrolled in academy as well for the next four years, and honestly, it was the best years of my life.  It felt like a real childhood.  I even elected to stay during the summers and work so that I wouldn't have to go home.  It was heaven on Earth.

Before academy, I would get glimpses of a different kind of adventism.  One that was less extreme.  We siblings would come to know this as the 'American Church'.  Once we got a taste of it, we would always beg to go.  You see, for some odd reason, the American Churches were well-funded, so their facilities were always nice and had A/C.  Meanwhile, the spanish churches I went to were either borrowed churches, hole in the walls, straight up dumps.  There was one that was truly awful.  It was a church that looked like it was put together by an unholy amalgamation of trailers duct taped together.  Somehow it held.  And these places always had that one A/V enthusiast that was in charge of all the equipment but could never get it right, so feedback was constant.  And, why oh why do these spanish churches sing off key?!?!?  My ears!!!

Anyways, I bring up the different cultured churches to emphasize why going to boarding school was such a big deal for me.  The theology was less cruel, less fire and brimstone, less panic.   To this day, I am still grateful for that time, even though I am no longer a believer.  

During my time in the adventist education system, I went through multiple revivals, multiple baptisms.  I even went through the phase of destroying all my worldly things so that I could give my life to Christ.  My poor super nintendo, my poor Xbox.  You deserved better than to be tossed into a dumpster in a ridiculous display of self-righteousness.  At times I would become so extreme, I would go on preaching sprees and try to convince other people of the severity of the end times, and how soon Jesus was coming back.  I told them how they were all asleep and lukewarm as per Revelation and the messages to the churches.  I told them about  Messages to Young People, and how we shouldn't be playing competitive sports.  There were two kinds of adventists in my mind:  the contemporary ones, and the 'real' ones.  The real ones were making the others uncomfortable with all the talk of the second coming and renouncing the world.  We got too comfortable!

My final days of being christian happened gradually.  It started with the stereotypical 'backsliding'.  I hung out with 'the wrong crowd', enjoyed some college style partying.  Even ended up dropping out of Adventist college to move in with some fellower partiers, and hosted some of the sickest parties around!   Well, then there was one more time where I repented and went back to God, but I will never forget the time I turned around for good.  

I was so convicted that I ended up joining Amazing Facts College of Evangelism.  I did my time in AFCOE, helped with one of Doug Batchelor's prophecy seminars.  I remember going door to door and trying to convince people to attend.  Got rejected a bunch, made some connections with people who had actual, real life problems, and needed real help.  I offered them bible studies instead...  

We would regroup with fellow AFCOEs and talk about the struggles of the day and the victories for christ.   Praise the lord!!...   Or so I thought at the time.  After graduating AFCOE, I signed up for bible work out in Cali, where I continued to do the work.  Here is where it all started to unravel.  No longer was I a volunteer.  I was on the payroll, however meager it was.  That meant I needed to produce results.  During that summer, I hit a moment where I couldn't force myself to go knock on any more doors.  I was tired.  I was tired of the rejection.  Tired of the humiliation.  Tired of the pressure.  I looked to my leaders for help.  Instead of help, I got a ""if you can't do the work, you need to leave"".  Not in those words, mind you, but it was very cold and callous.  I honestly don't remember the conversation, but I had shut myself in my host's home.  I couldn't do it anymore.  I begged god to give me the courage, to not fail him.  Silence.  Nothing.  So I quit.   I quit, feeling like I let down god.  I quit, realizing that I had turned my back on the faith.  I used to challenge myself to see if I truly believed in god, or if it was all pretend.  I would tell myself that if I truly believed, I would go to a muslim country and try to introduce them to Jesus.  I would most likely die, but that was something I was supposed to be ready for.  I would even challenge myself and say things like, if I really believe in god, why can't I heal the sick like the apostles.  Yeah, yeah, blah blah Latter day rain blah blah.  But I didn't believe that interpretation.  I believed that the reason we didn't see mass healing was because we didn't believe.    And now, here I was.  No powers, no courage.   No belief.

It was a steady decline after that.  I went home, reconnected with my party friends, and the rest of life just  played on.  Slowly without religion.  I eventually got serious and finished school in a state college, settled down, married an adventist who was just as non-practicing as I was, and started a family.  It has taken a long time to finally not be afraid to admit what my true beliefs are now, because I was still afraid of ultimately denouncing faith.  But I was no longer afraid, because there was nothing to fear.  I accepted that I was an atheist.

  
TL:DR  Sorry everyone!! I had to get that off my chest, especially after my therapy session today.  I was told to connect with some ex-faith groups to be able to discuss spiritual trauma and share experiences     I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, and am being treated for all.  Yes, I struggle, but I also succeed.  I am healing.  And I am no longer afraid of a damnation that is not coming, nor do I believe that I deserve to be damned for existing.

The St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres are set for Game 3 of their series, a matchup as tense as a Netflix password fight. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a MLB umpire and the humor of a ballpark hot-dog vendor juggling pretzels.

---

### Odds & Implied Probabilities: Who‚Äôs the Real Deal?

The Cardinals are favored at **-160** (implied probability: **61.5%**), while the Padres sit at **+135** (**42.5%**). These numbers suggest St. Louis is the safer bet, but don‚Äôt let the Padres‚Äô underdog status fool you‚Äîthey‚Äôve won **48% of games** when priced at +135 or worse this season. Meanwhile, the Cards‚Äô high-scoring offense (4.5 R/G) faces a Padres‚Äô staff with a **3.66 ERA** (7th in MLB), which is as reliable as a leaky umbrella in a hurricane.

But here‚Äôs the twist: **Matthew Liberatore**, St. Louis‚Äô left-handed starter, has struggled lately with velocity dips and a **4.82 ERA** over his last five starts. The Padres, meanwhile, feast on lefties, sporting a **.789 OPS vs. LHP**, the 5th-best mark in baseball. It‚Äôs like sending a vampire to a party where the only blood available is O-negative and left-handed.

### Injury & News: Shoelaces, HBP, and Randy‚Äôs Lack of K‚Äôs

Liberatore claims he‚Äôs ‚Äúrejuvenated‚Äù after extra rest, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äî100 innings is a **career high** for a 25-year-old. He‚Äôs thrown like a pitcher who‚Äôs been on a 12-hour road trip with a misfiring espresso machine: inconsistent, jittery, and prone to spilling coffee on the defense. The Cardinals need him to recapture his early-season magic, not serve up fastballs like they‚Äôre free samples at a Costco.

On the Padres‚Äô side, **Randy Vasquez** is about as intimidating as a toddler with a toy sword. His **4.1 BB/9** and **8.3% whiff rate** (per Statcast) make him a punchling for St. Louis‚Äô contact-heavy lineup. But hey, at least he‚Äôs

Novel terrors visited me after midnight, new dark-red fears that kept me from peace. I slept without rest, feeling shrunken and slack.

I saw the split between mine and the world of sleep, pushed my hand through their walls. I laid in my bed, eyes closed and breathing. And then I was shoved from waking‚Äîphysically pushed from my bed, it felt like, and brought outside my body to some other place:

I stood in a sickroom, but barren of hospital trappings‚Äîno IV bags or infusion pumps, no heart monitors or blood pressure cuffs. I recognized the man in the hospital bed. It was Eugene Jurado. The Otter of Corpus Christi.

The room was crisp and cool like winter chill, but also in the foul way of perenially-unsanitized Frigidaires. Soon, though, and quickly, came a cloud of warm air. Outside was the nighttime noise of wilderness traffic, the secret thrumming of heartbeats and hungry stomachs in the living dark.

Jurado sat up in his bed, his nostrils flaring. He sniffed at the air, and I thought he found that it reeked. I picked up the scent a split second following; unctuous like tallow candles burning, the lingering decay of a road cleared of dead deer a day or so past.

He left his bed with hackles up, teeth clenched and enamel creaking like warped wood‚Äîcords of arousal pushed through the flesh of his neck. Jurado looked in my exact direction with his fists balled tight. Did he see me? He stared right where I stood, his face bathed in the asylum‚Äôs cool and pacificating light.

But he turned away to go stand by the window.

Maybe he sensed what I sensed, too, the air charged with the electricity of premonition.

The sound that followed lasted all of two seconds. Wind rushing forward like a wave behind a wraith‚Äôs Komodo squall. I heard it shatter before it happened.

The glass window exploded. I shielded my eyes.

When the glass settled, I looked up and saw Eugene Jurado spasming in place‚Äîarms down by his sides, feet a foot off the ground. His back protruded what looked like a sharp-pointed parking cone made out of bone.

When the beak ripped back out of Jurado‚Äôs body, there was a dripping, gory hole in his chest through which moonlight shone. Eugene Jurado dropped to the floor, dead.

I ran to the window‚Äîmaybe I knew, but I had to go see. And there it (or he) was: Quetzalcoatlus. Its wings bended and propped on the forelimb hands at its elbows, standing haunched on its knuckles like a great ape. It turned away and I could see its muscles tensing, girding for flight.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù

It stopped and turned back around, then came closer, close enough that I could look in its eyes. One eye was almost too dark to see; the other was blue.

Just like my father, the serpent had different-colored eyes. A coincidence of heterochromia.

ê°ó

I didn‚Äôt go check on Dad that morning before work. I wanted to see‚Ä¶

Maybe my dreams were only that. Jurado had slept living through the night, however it is that murderers manage to sleep, secure in the edifice of his chair-ducking dodge. He was alive because my nightmares meant nothing but my own troubled sleep.

But I was wrong.

By late afternoon the news started to break. And with it, video footage leaked from Rusk State Hospital. The crazies came out full-force on their smartphones, screaming their vid-filtered heads off, TikToking hot takes, thanking Sweet Jesus (or blaming other less notable Jews).

I forbade myself watching the surveillance footage. But of course I did. It was unbelievable, what it showed. Later, even-handed newsmen (if ad dollars hadn‚Äôt eaten them all) would all come around and say it was real. Before then, however, much was blamed on AI (and the Jews).

Viewing the footage was like rewatching a familiar fight scene with the actors removed. Like if you watched the championship bout at the end of Rocky but only saw Balboa‚Äôs and Apollo Creed‚Äôs gloves, not their bodies, not their legs or their arms. I saw the asylum patient room, I saw the window break, I saw an invisible something blow out Jurado‚Äôs back.

But there was no evidence of my own witness, not a pixel of playback to prove the dragon was the Otter‚Äôs impaler. A mysterious nothing was what stuck Jurado through like an invisible shish through an unseeable kabob.

ê°ó

I rose at bakers‚Äô hours to go visit Dad and catch him at breakfast before my day‚Äôs work. When I let myself in, he was sitting at the table, looking at an iPad I bought for him before he went off his nut. I smelled fresh-brewed coffee and home cooking.

Mary set a plate of eggs and turkey bacon in front of him and kissed the top of his head. A lucid day or two and the old man already had both the honey and the bee.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äôs this?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúEggs. Turkey bacon,‚Äù Mary said. She returned to minding the skillet.

‚ÄúI mean, why isn‚Äôt it regular bacon?‚Äù

‚ÄúRegular bacon‚Äôs going to stop up your heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I wanted turkey bacon, I‚Äôd tell you I wanted turkey bacon,‚Äù he said.

I sat down at the table, they playfully bickered. Dad smiled at me and reached out and patted my hand.

I felt sick. Maybe I was. Maybe I was sicker than Dad. Maybe I was much more demented than he‚Äôd ever been, and I‚Äôd dreamed up the last days of prehistoric worlds and psychokinesis, retribution and possession. Maybe it was all inside my head. If I could just‚Äî

‚Äú‚Äîyour coffee?‚Äù

I looked up at Mary.

‚ÄúRemind me how you take your coffee?‚Äù Mary said.

‚ÄúBlack is fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou seen the news last night, Charlie?‚Äù Mary poured the coffee into a mug. I saw it steam piping hot.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I lied.

‚ÄúThat terrible, terrible man was killed. The Otter of Corpus Christi?‚Äù she said.

Dad grumbled into his neck. I couldn‚Äôt tell if that bore any meaning.

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I watched her bring the mug over to me along with a milk carton and a tiny lidded pot of sugar. ‚ÄúJust in case you change your mind,‚Äù she said, sitting down at the table. ‚ÄúDid you see it?‚Äù

Dad laughed low in his throat. I side-eyed and caught him lost in his deeds.

‚ÄúHe just about exploded inside his cell. Just on his own. Nobody knows what to make of it,‚Äù Mary said.

Dad mumbled something that didn‚Äôt make it past his lips.

‚ÄúWhat was that? We couldn‚Äôt hear you,‚Äù Mary said.

‚ÄúRectification,‚Äù Dad said.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I watched them talk, trying to believe I wasn‚Äôt there, that I‚Äôd never been there. I thought if I believed it, my mind could escape my body.

‚ÄúThat was a rectification,‚Äù Dad said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when a hand reaches out, Mary‚Äîreaches out with the sanction of ghosts, and forcefeeds sinners their rightwise fate.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù She smiled, oblivious or happy to appear to be.

‚ÄúIt means‚Äî‚Äù Dad interrupted himself. ‚ÄúCharlie, my boy. What do you think that means?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat means‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, softly trailing.

‚ÄúRectification, Charlie. Rectifying sins. No, rectifying a man. Do you think killing a man can save his soul?‚Äù

‚ÄúKilling him‚Ä¶?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúDo you think that God might send men to make their bed with monsters? To save the men‚Äôs families from worse monsters, still?‚Äù

There was a loud ping in my phone and I jumped in my seat. Then another notification, then another. I would have ignored it, but more of them came. Another, then two more, then three and a flood.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù I walked away from the table‚Äîa dozen texts and missed calls, most from Mauricio. I opened his last text:

‚Äúla esposa de Eddie llam√≥

el falleci√≥ hoy temprano‚Äù

Eduardo was dead.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

ê°ó

‚ÄúGo in the other room please, Mary,‚Äù I said.

She turned from scraping out the skillet over the bin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs wrong,‚Äù I said, trying to keep level, trying so everyone else thought I kept level, ‚ÄúI just need to talk to Dad‚Äîjust me and him, that‚Äôs all. Please, Mary.‚Äù I nodded toward the swinging door that let out the back of the kitchen.

Mary looked at my father. He dipped a subtle but clear nod. She twisted the dishrag in her hands, stretched out the twist a little. ‚ÄúAlright, then. You boys holler if you need me. I‚Äôll just‚ÄîI‚Äôll go to the grocery, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a real good idea, Mare,‚Äù Dad said, looking at me and not at Mary. Even when he spoke to her, he kept his eyes on me. ‚ÄúYou go ahead and go to the grocery store and order us some of the things we need for dinner tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt know we had anything special planned,‚Äù Mary said.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt. But you go ahead now. Go ahead and get us something good to eat, Mare. There doesn‚Äôt need to be nothing special happening for us to eat a good meal, does there?‚Äù Dad smiled at me, smiled like the high school kids lining up center court after a ball game, when they put out for a handshake and ‚Äúgood game‚Äù actually means you can go and get fucked.

‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI like to shop for dinner anyhow.‚Äù She grabbed her purse and her keys and headed for the door.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, Mare. You go ahead now. That‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Mary left.

I sat down at the table again, but not at my dad‚Äôs elbow. I sat across the table from him.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid. Tell me I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid.‚Äù

His scofflaw‚Äôs smile broke. His eyes frowned for him. ‚ÄúThings change, boy. They change, alright? But it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôll always be okay now. I know what to do.‚Äù

I ran my hands along the sides of the table and felt the rough spots on the wood grain.

‚ÄúSay something, son,‚Äù my dad said.

‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúSay what you think needs to be said.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you kill Eddie?‚Äù I looked him in the eye.

‚ÄúHe was already on the way out.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶even possible‚Ä¶‚Äù I shook the flies out of my head. I gripped the table tighter to keep from falling out of myself, ‚Äúhow is this‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was already on the way out, Charlie. He was already going. But‚Äîlisten, Charlie‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthese aren‚Äôt things that can happen in the world‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe knew too much. He could‚Äôve gone and told. It‚Äôs a shame, boy‚Äî‚Äù

I‚Äôd been living in a lifelong dream thinking it was the real world. Now the illusion was broken, and I was waking to the world of brutes. ‚ÄúOh my God. Dad‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äîa shame, but he knew too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has kids. Jesus Christ, he has kids. He‚Äôs got a wife‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dad wrapped his arms around himself and nodded. ‚ÄúFine. He had a wife. Me, too. I had a wife, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I said, wanting to disbelieve. But reality‚Äôs new axioms were unassailable, like Euclidean postulates, the Revenue Code.

‚ÄúIt?‚Äù

‚ÄúExplain it to me.‚Äù

Dad cupped his hands and leaned over the table, shaking his head‚Äînot saying no, but just shaking his head. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to explain.‚Äù He held his palms up and splayed his fingers and looked down in the lines of his own hands, seeing things only he could see. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hungry, Charlie. It‚Äôs hungry, and it needs to eat. And if I don‚Äôt feed it, it‚Äôs going to find someone else to feed it. There‚Äôs some good we can do here‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSome good?‚Äù I pushed back in my chair. I looked at my father in a way I‚Äôd never seen him before.

‚ÄúThat man, Charlie, that man was no good.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about that psychopath Eugene Jurado. I‚Äôm talking about Eddie! He laid grout and wired light switches. What the hell did he ever do to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt found us‚Äîus, Charlie, out of everyone. There‚Äôs no losing. Except for if Eddie told what he saw. But there‚Äôs no losing now, see? I get my mind back and get to keep it, too. How‚Äôd you like to have your cake and eat it? Think about it. All I‚Äôve got to do is feed it when it gets hungry. How often can something that almost isn‚Äôt real even be hungry? It‚Äôs a deal, boy. It‚Äôs a deal like that‚Äôs never been had. There‚Äôs nothing that can hurt me or you anymore. There‚Äôs no losing here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo losing?‚Äù I stood up and my chair hit the kitchen floor before it bounced and rattled to silence. ‚ÄúYou killed a man. Two! Are you out of your mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot anymore,‚Äù he said. And then he laughed in a way that belied his contention. This was a foreign man to me; this was a stranger wearing his face.

I heard the swinging door behind me and turned to look. Mary was standing there.

‚ÄúI prayed on it Charlie,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúMary, me and the boy‚Äî‚Äù Dad began.

‚ÄúI prayed on it, and I think Jesus wants this. He ain‚Äôt told me, but I heard him anyhow. In my heart, like.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus?‚Äù I said.

She nodded. ‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

‚ÄúMary, in my experience, people say Jesus wants something because whatever it is, they want it, too.‚Äù I turned toward my father. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe this happy horseshit, do you‚Äîwhat, that you‚Äôre Christ‚Äôs bloody right hand?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what Jesus wants. I care what I got, and what I want‚Äôs to keep it. We can do good things, so long as it eats.‚Äù He stood up at his end of the table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you time to see it, boy. I‚Äôll give you time to see. But I won‚Äôt give you forever. This is a gift, Charlie. You got to see. You got to see.‚Äù

I looked at Mary, but she wouldn‚Äôt meet me eye-to-eye. I scoffed and looked back at my dad. ‚ÄúSo this is how it is?‚Äù

He tightened his grip on his own arms across his chest and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs going to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù I stood up, and went toward the door.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôre you going, son?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôre you going, son? Don‚Äôt do something you can‚Äôt undo, you hear me?‚Äù

I closed the door behind me as I left, but could still hear my father say from the other side of the door, ‚Äú*There‚Äôs no losing, son. There‚Äôs no losing!*‚Äù

The garage smelled like plantlife and electrical power. It smelled like iron-rich blood and a transplant center‚Äôs worth of bone marrow. The air was wet and the air felt like it had never been cool and never would be.

I stood in front of Quetzelcoatlus‚Äôs ancient skull, holding a sledgehammer.

What was inside it? How was it the way it was? A thing that raised my father from a valley of fog, but gave him a stomach enough to chew up people‚Äôs lives‚Äîhow had naught but old bone thinned the bonds of our blood?

I stood in front of Quetzelcoatlus, sledgehammer in hand. I didn‚Äôt know if I had it in me to lose my father again. I held the hammer, gripped the hammer. I didn‚Äôt know what it would do to my soul, the weight of these things I now knew. The weight. The hammer had weight and I knew its weight. It was a familiar weight to me. Some weights were familiar weights.

I didn‚Äôt know if I could handle Dad falling back into the valley of fog. But I knew how to swing the hammer. Keep the horse in front of the cart and cross the bridge when you come to it. I didn‚Äôt know if I could bear a future where he was both my father and a man who killed other fathers. The hammer was my limb. It was part of me. I knew its weight. Its weight was familiar to me.

How could the world change so quickly?

I stood before the serpent‚Äôs skull of power, and I understood what those sailors meant when, long ago, they looked down into the heart of a whirlpooling maelstrom, even while they heard come from behind them the hurricane winds‚ÄîI understood what it meant to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea.

I stood there with the hammer, and I wondered which choice I would make. And then, once I‚Äôd chosen, what would still remain?

‚ú±NB:

Preceding is an account by the late Texan real estate reveloper Charles Bingham Melcombe. It pertains, as you will see, to the letters unearthed during the Steamboat House‚Äôs recent preservation efforts, specifically the correspondence between Sam Houston and the christianized Cherokee tribesman Normand Torlind (n√©e Unega Gola).

Torlind lived in Hiwasee (or, Jolly‚Äôs) Island in Tennessee at the same time as Houston, and the two remained close until the First Texan President‚Äôs decease in Huntsville during the Civil War.

Below is an excerpt from one of Torlind‚Äôs letters, sent to Sam Houston not long before he died at the Steamboat House:

*‚Äú\[...\]do not subscribe to any of spiritualism‚Äôs conceits, being myself saved by the true grace of Jesus Christ Lord, whose unearthly power is to be credited, and credited alone, for all phenomenal mystery.*

*‚ÄúMoreover, I am at pains to remind you that a drunken heathen performing magical entertainments on a ‚Äòskull‚Äô, if a skull it was, interrelates nothing to Santa Anna having been trounced at the Battle of San Jacinto. And whether there is an ossuary below a church somewhere wherein the skull lays buried still is none of my concern.*

*‚ÄúTexan independence was won with bullets, blood, and the sacrifice of good and brave Texans, not by an invisible dragon or whatever else otherwise pulled from Aesop‚Äôs Fables. You are becoming maudlin and senilely demented in the years of your dotage, and my advice to you is to more regularly attend to the daily reading of Scripture, lessen the amount of red meat in your diet, and perhaps buy yourself a stiffer mattress.*

*‚ÄúI plan to visit Huntsville in the autumn, so for goodness‚Äô sake, try to keep it together until then, Sam.*

*‚ÄúYour Friend in Christ,*

*Normand‚Äù*",2,1753564790.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôre away at the seaside for a few days as a family.
The drive was 4.5hrs and I packed everything and sorted what we needed.

A few things have come up:

We stopped halfway for our son, then hit some traffic coming out of the services. Somehow that was pinned on me, and it really affected his mood. He even said he wanted to turn around and go home.

He got annoyed that I didn‚Äôt offer to drive. He normally drives so it didn‚Äôt cross my mind, and I don‚Äôt feel confident driving in unfamiliar areas. Later, when we left one place, he asked me to drive. I did, but when I slowed down at a pedestrian crossing, he told me to get out and took over himself.

On the way back to the hotel that evening, he said he was going to kick me out of the car. I hadn‚Äôt said anything, and I think it was because I was quiet. He told me I need to grow up and drive more, which felt a bit harsh.

Later, on a walk, our son got upset and he handed the buggy over quite abruptly and told me to ‚Äúdeal with that‚Äù or something similar.

We had a quick coffee break and he said we might as well go home early, even though we‚Äôre meant to stay another day.

He got frustrated when I didn‚Äôt answer my phone ‚Äî he‚Äôd gone to the car and left his key in my bag, but I was busy with our son at the time.

We also booked a beach trip and I‚Äôd said we should get lunch for our son first. He wanted to go straight there as there was a caf√© on site, but it was full. So we ended up heading back early without even going on the beach.

Breakfast felt rushed. he seemed on edge and doesn‚Äôt like feeding our son in case he chokes, which meant I couldn‚Äôt properly enjoy my breakfast or coffee. 
He has difficulty sitting in restaurants.

Then later, I got blamed for sand in the car from the buggy.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs me, our son, or just general stress, but it‚Äôs felt like a lot. That said, he has done some things to help.

He‚Äôs got me coffee and breakfast when I‚Äôve been feeding our son.

Unloaded the bags.

TLDR:

I wasn't feeling super in the day so I decided to have a coffee to energise myself - this is never usually a good idea. Anyway I went to the toilet üí©, I wasn't even straining or anything, in fact when I drink coffee it makes it sort of the opposite hence the bad idea.

Anyway it just looked like someone had chucked a load of bright red paint all in the toilet bowl. Bleeding has happened to me before but not to this extent. I called 111 (I'm UK based) so they gave me a drs appointment the next day and an ointment. I didn't use the ointment at first but when I tried to go again the same thing happened.
Called again, got in for an emergency appointment at the hospital. I was examined and she told me I have hemorrhoids (internal).
She advised me to keep using the ointment but if it gets to the point where I'm constantly pooping blood I need to go up A and E.

I have been using the ointment twice a day and I still keep bleeding whenever I try to go, I think once there was no blood - I won't lie though I feel like I'm constipated and I've been trying a gentle laxative to not much effect.

Even if I'm gassy (on the toilet, sorry gross) I just hear the wooshing sound of blood coming out of me. No pain though. 
I also feel as I don't even know how to go to the toilet anymore. Just don't know how to stop the bleeding.

Important info about me: cis male, single, 50+

Today I visited a beauty supply store while gigging for Instacart. I‚Äôve never been in such a store, obviously, I‚Äôm not their target demographic. It was three items. I was greeted by the sole employee there, the manager as it turns out, and she asked if she could help. I accepted the offer, showed her the products, she found them quickly, and I slowed the process because I noticed no ring on that finger. 

I know how to flirt, but can‚Äôt easily recognize a return flirt, especially when it involves anyone in the retail space where men too often read kindness as flirtation. 

My hints that she was agreeable to my flirting: I said I should return to get recommendations on nail polish. She replied I noticed both your fingers and toes are painted. They are, but she said it with a little smile, not a business smile, a more friendly smile. We finished the purchase and I walked out of the door, but before it closed, I stepped back in and introduced myself by name. She replied with her name and said It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you. I replied in kind. 

My next Instacart shopping was at a store that had greeting cards. On a whim, I purchased one, wrote a note, and mailed it to her. In the note I essentially said Yes I was flirting with you, and would be delighted to continue the conversation. I named the place (a coffee shop in a busy and beautiful business district not far from her shop), and asked her to name the time and date. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. I gave my home address, but not my full name, nor a cell #. This means she must write back ‚Äî via USPS!

A little bit about me:

- I have brown hair, hazel eyes, average build. Pierced ears. No tattoos‚Ä¶yet.

- I play guitar. It‚Äôs a pretty big part of my life, so it‚Äôs probably no surprise that I love music. I like a little bit of everything, from rock and metal, to country, to jazz etc. There are so many great artists to choose from, but John Mayer is a favorite.

- I also love photography! Portraits are my favorite thing to shoot. I‚Äôd like to eventually work full time as a fashion photographer.

- Into Marvel and DC, Star Wars and Star Trek. Batman is probably my favorite fictional character.

- Big fan of movies and classic TV, especially sitcoms!

- One of my favorite things to do is grab a coffee with a friend and talk about everything and nothing haha Do aliens exist? Favorite movies? How‚Äôs life going? The topic doesn‚Äôt really matter as long as the company and the coffee is good.

- Love animals, although I have to say that I‚Äôm definitely a dog person first and foremost. Horses are cool too.

- A couple things that I‚Äôd like to check out or try: I‚Äôd really like to get better at drawing, and I‚Äôd also like to take a Salsa dancing class.

Hopefully that‚Äôs a start! Feel free to ask about anything else that you‚Äôre curious about.

Who I‚Äôm looking for:

- Someone in her 20s or 30s

- Someone who has some passions and interests they want to share and teach me about!

- Someone who wants to grab coffee, go to some awesome concerts, spend some afternoons just having fun window-shopping and exploring, maybe go hiking from time to time. And just have some chill times together talking and watching our favorite movies and shows.

- Ideally, living in the St. Louis area.

- Maybe it sounds silly, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm basically looking for the girl next door. Someone sweet, cute, kind, fun, and who has a positive attitude. Someone who I click with, and who I can trust. An awesome friendship that hopefully leads to an awesome romance.

Picture 4: the next oldest bucket. You can see a nice crop of white mold over everything, showing that there is no contamination or air leakage.

I add, so that when I‚Äôm ready for the final ferment, the bucket is pretty packed. 

Picture 5: the oldest bucket (I keep three buckets in circulation; I empty the oldest into outdoor compost when the youngest gets filled and then start over). Again, you can see a nice crop of white mold over the surface. 

Picture 5: the drainage in the outer bucket from that last bokashi bucket. It‚Äôs got a nice crop of yeast and microbes in it. I do a Rich Earth Institute pee carboy‚ÄîGoogle
it‚Äî (which goes on my compost or leaf mold), and often, I pour the bokashi juice into the pee carboy to neutralize the urine. Have also used it for drain cleaning and (diluted) as houseplant fertilizer. ",1,1753564528.0,bokashi,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best coconut coffee body washes frequently enough share a set of defining features that contribute to their overall effectiveness and desirability.**Natural Ingredients:** A primary feature is the use of natural ingredients such as coconut oil, coffee extract, and other plant-based oils and extracts. These ingredients are chosen for their beneficial properties, including moisturizing, exfoliating, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. The concentration and quality of these ingredients significantly impact the body wash's performance.

**Foaming Action:** The ability to create a rich and luxurious lather is crucial. Good foaming action ensures that the body wash effectively encapsulates and removes dirt,oil,and impurities from the skin's surface. Some body washes use natural surfactants like coconut-derived cleansers to achieve this, while others may rely on synthetic foaming agents. The type of surfactant used affects the gentleness and overall feeling on the skin.

**Hydrating Properties:** Coconut oil is known for its excellent moisturizing capabilities.The best coconut coffee body washes leverage this by using a sufficient amount of coconut oil (or derivatives) to hydrate the skin during the cleansing process. This prevents the skin from feeling dry or stripped after showering, a common issue with many conventional body washes.

**Exfoliating Coffee Grounds:** Many coconut coffee body washes include finely ground coffee particles to provide gentle exfoliation.This mechanical exfoliation helps to remove dead skin cells, promote circulation, and leave the skin feeling smoother and more radiant.

**fragrance Profile:** The signature scent is a key selling point. A well-balanced fragrance that combines the creamy sweetness of coconut with the rich, stimulating aroma of coffee creates an invigorating and enjoyable sensory experience. The fragrance should be pleasant and long-lasting without being overpowering or artificial-smelling.

**Packaging and Dispensing:** The packaging is an critically important factor; it should be aesthetically pleasing, functional, and environmentally conscious. Easy-to-use pumps or squeeze bottles are preferred for convenient dispensing in the shower.Recyclable or biodegradable packaging materials add to the product‚Äôs appeal for environmentally conscious consumers.

We were together for 8 months. I‚Äôll be honest, I was feeling frustrated during our last month together because she wasn‚Äôt putting in much effort to communicate her problems with me only leading to minor arguments. Nonetheless, we both agreed the best course of action was to separate.

I was nervous and didn‚Äôt know what to expect when we discussed ending our relationship because this was my first serious one. I was surprised after the fact because it was very mutual and full of sad emotions. My ex kept crying and bringing up fond memories and I did the same. She cried more than me. We talked about our families and our love for them. 

Before I left, my ex kept asking if I was going to block her and asked if I‚Äôd continue to stop by her work to say hello. I thought that ask was an unusual ask. I said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the best idea during this time of healing and recovery.‚Äù She balled her eyes out after I responded to her declining. She also insisted we should be friends for the time being. I didn‚Äôt like that at all because it felt like putting a bandaid on a huge wound. 

Fast forward a week, I gathered her belongings and mustered up the courage to drop off her items at her house. Everything was mutual and there was no hate between us, just sorrow. We talked for a few hours about what we‚Äôve been doing to heal and what our personal goals were moving forward. We discussed and reminisced on the past together and cried again. Before I left, we kissed for a while and again, she asked me if I‚Äôd stop by her work. I deflected and said my goodbyes. 

About two weeks ago, I texted her clarifying some things I said when I dropped off her stuff. I was numb and a bit blunt because experiencing these kind of emotions are new to me. I apologized for my demeanor that day. She also apologized because she was upset and sad about the situation. I texted her saying, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll stop by in the future at your work.‚Äù

Her response was full of delight. She asked if I wanted to go out a grab a coffee sometime. I agreed to it, but I told her we‚Äôd have to wait until I return from a work trip. My ex is aware of this work trip I‚Äôm on and has an estimate of when I return. By the time I return, it will be exactly 2 months since the breakup. We have not made any contact recently. 

Waiting to come back has been eating me up and is mentally painful. I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up. I keep trying to think of outcomes and reevaluating what we had and what our issues were. 

All I can think about is her sitting across the table from me talking about what she‚Äôs been up to and how she‚Äôs healing and vice versa. As  crazy as it seems post breakup, life has been going well for me. I‚Äôve found myself again, I‚Äôve been taking great strides bettering myself, I got a decent pay raise at work, life is good. I just keep thinking about seeing her again while I‚Äôm away.

Most tablets are simply dropped into a glass of water with the retainer, where they dissolve and begin working promptly.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right retainer cleaning tablets can be a little overwhelming given the number of options on the market.here are some common questions answered based on 2025 developments:

**Are retainer cleaning tablets safe for all types of retainers?**
Most retainer cleaning tablets are generally safe for use on a variety of removable retainers, including clear aligners, Hawley retainers (with acrylic and wire components), and Essix retainers. Though, it's always best to check the product label or consult with your orthodontist to ensure compatibility, especially if you have a retainer constructed of unique materials. Some newer retainer materials might react negatively with certain tablet ingredients.

**How often shoudl I clean my retainer with cleaning tablets?**
Ideally, you should clean your retainer with cleaning tablets daily, or at least several times a week.Daily cleaning helps prevent the buildup of plaque, bacteria, and stains, ensuring optimal hygiene and freshness. In 2025, improved tablet formulations have allowed some brands to claim effectiveness with less frequent use, but daily cleaning is still the gold standard.

**Can I use regular toothpaste to clean my retainer instead of cleaning tablets?**
No, you should not use regular toothpaste to clean your retainer. Toothpaste can be abrasive and can scratch the surface of the retainer, creating microscopic crevices that trap bacteria and odors. Moreover, some ingredients in toothpaste can discolor or damage the material of the retainer. Cleaning tablets are specifically formulated to clean retainers gently and effectively without causing damage.

**Will retainer cleaning tablets whiten my teeth?**
While some retainer cleaning tablets contain ingredients that can help remove surface stains from the retainer itself, they are not designed to whiten teeth. the concentration of whitening agents in these tablets is typically too low to have a significant effect on tooth color. If you are looking to whiten your teeth, consult with your dentist about professional teeth whitening options.

## Key Features Analysis

The value of an expensive liquor cannot be truly assessed without understanding the intricacies of its production and craftsmanship.

**Age and Maturation:** A significant factor contributing to the price of expensive liquor is the age and maturation process.

Liquors aged for extended periods in oak barrels,frequently enough decades,develop complex flavors and aromas. the wood imparts tannins,vanillin,and other compounds that transform the raw spirit into something extraordinary. longer maturation results in smoother, more refined profiles. Such as,a 50-year-old Scotch whisky undergoes tremendous transformation,gaining layers of flavor that simply cannot be replicated in younger expressions. The scarcity created by long aging periods further contributes to the hefty price tag.**Rarity and Limited Editions:** The availability of certain liquors profoundly shapes their value.

Limited edition releases, often commemorating special events or using rare ingredients, command high prices due to their scarcity. These are frequently reserved for collectors and aficionados who appreciate the uniqueness of these bottles. Distilleries might produce a limited run of a specific whisky using a unique cask type,or a tequila using agave from a specific,historic field.The numbered bottles and ornate packaging add to their appeal.

**Bottling and Presentation:** Beyond the liquid inside, the presentation of expensive liquor is an art form in itself.

Many high-end bottles are housed in exquisitely designed decanters made from crystal or handcrafted glass. Elaborate packaging with intricate details further enhances the exclusivity of the product. Brands might collaborate with renowned artists or designers to create unique bottle designs, making them collectible pieces of art in their own right. The overall presentation communicates the value and prestige of the liquor within.

**Proof and Alcohol content:** The percentage of alcohol by volume plays a key role in conveying aromas.

Expensive liquor is more than just the taste produced, but also the feel of it going down. A beverage too low on alcohol will not meet the expectations of the buyer, while too high renders it unappetizing. Therefore, balance is key in this area.

Key features of expensive liquor include:

* Extended aging periods
* Rare or limited-edition releases
* High-quality ingredients and distillation

1ma470b,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1ma470b/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

In september i transferred to a new school and early october i got a text from this girl i didn't know she said:""you seem like a nice guy wanna go out for coffee and I said sure the girl was cute and I wanted a realtionship a bit more serious so a couple weeks later i went out w her but we texted sparsley. I liked the first date but i told her let's wait a bit before we go into a relationship. At the start she told me she was 14 and that her bday was in january so i thought no problem she was a year and around three months younger. We got into a relationship in December up to thst it was great. In march i found out she was lying about her age and she was actually 13 and was turning 14 in february so i was 16 this whole time. I felt betrayed. I confronted her she started crying and apologizing and telling me that if she told me earlier i wouldn't want to be w her. I was a bitch so i accepted her apology and we continued dating. By april she started calling me over to her apartment while her parents were at work and we started hooking up at her place w/out sex obviously. And after each time i felt a tiny bit more terrible. By may she became different she was always starting little fights by telling me she didn't like something and a few hours later she would apologize for it and that went on for a while. I became so sick of it because she would never bring it up irl. She would only start that stuff over the phone. In early june she said i cant do ts anymore and i said lets break up atleast till september so i can think about this and in september we would go for coffee to discuss all this. A couple days later she wanted to get back together because she regretted it and she called me crying and allat. But i stayed firm and told her till september theres nothing. I was working quite long hours at this time and once after a 14h shift i come home to a messege from her that says:"" do you even miss me a little bit after we broke up"" condecendingly. I lost it there and blocked her. 
Do I get back with this girl?I need advice!

Just sharing,"Just wanted to share an experience and curious if others have had something similar. It left me thinking about how strange digital dating can feel.

A guy liked one of my Hinge prompts (not a photo) on July 5, then messaged me 8 days later saying he liked my vibe and that I seemed ‚Äúvery smart and world conscious,‚Äù and that he‚Äôd be interested in chatting or doing a short video call to see if we connect before meeting. I also included a note that a match can read before deciding to message you, and he assured me he did and that he agreed. 

I responded a few days later with a thoughtful (but warm) reply to the political moment he referenced. I also asked him a question back to keep the convo going. A week passed, so I sent a short follow-up thanking him for his message and gave my number since he mentioned wanting to talk more, and Hinge doesn't offer video calls. 

A few hours later ‚Äî he unmatched.

It‚Äôs so odd. He initiated. He said he would be interested in chatting more. I responded with openness, no pressure. And he bailed. And I already know this is common with dating apps. But it's also rare to receive such an intentional message so I decided to give it a shot. 

I‚Äôve accepted it, but it made me reflect on how surreal dating apps are. When someone unmatches, it‚Äôs like the whole interaction never existed. There‚Äôs no street corner, no coffee shop, no ‚Äúwe met through a friend.‚Äù Just poof. A digital imprint disappears. It happened, but it also didn‚Äôt.

Anyway, just sharing. Curious if others have felt this liminal weirdness of digital connection/disconnection. I'm laughing about it now.  ",2,1753563455.0,HingeStories,8,1.0,False

for example:  
Last week i finally got Nekomata. Yeah i know she is not a good character, but i really like her and finally got her. Its been a whole week of doing my dailies and still couldnt event get her to level 60. And after that i still need to worry about her talents, and then her weapon, and then her discs.   
""oh, you can use the coffee thing to get more rewards""  
yeah, you can, and i used to. but then i realized that costs a ridiculous amount of dennies. and if  you do that every day, guess what? now you have to farm dennies too.....like, how long is this gonna take? 1-2 months? 

I havent pulled for a single character since Miyabi cause im saving pulls for the Angels of Delusion (soon \*copium\*). But now im thinking.   
imagine you saving pulls for a character that you really want. but then once you get them, you cant even use them. You finally got the character and then you have to wait weeks to actually properly use them.   
I feel like now getting new characters its less a reward and more of a chore.

I stopped playing genshin impact for the same reason. the farming there is abysmal and it feels really bad. and im afraid zzz its heading to the same path for me.   
(from all the gachas i play. star rail is probably the easiest to farm imo. every character i get there i always manage to build them in a few days without a sweat)

1ma3t73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1ma3t73/i_have_returned_home/,I have returned Home,"Hello all. Just wanted to share something about a recent encounter and debate I had with a few, nondenominational, family members. 

I‚Äôm a cradle Catholic but later on in my adult life I became disengaged. I simply believed that I only need a personal relationship with God; nothing else. These two family members, one of whom was actually converted by the other, I speak of are members of a nondenominational church. I would attend services when invited and sometimes it became a routine to go to the service before going out to celebrate a birthday or holiday. I‚Äôm not going to pretend I wasn‚Äôt drawn to the music and the modern take of worship. It did allow me to rethink my relationship with God and my faith. However, over time, after attending services intermittently in the 5 years (while also attending mass here and there), I started to see the holes in this church. Nor did I ever feel ‚Äúhome.‚Äù Something was still missing. The cracks started to grow larger. From the concert lie music, theatrics, fog machine and the coffee shop. Additionally,  there was lack in conviction, moral consistency and stances on current related topics; they seemed to just danced around the idea and ran along the slogan of: be kind (duh). The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was their Mother‚Äôs Day service: it was purely a TED talk and didn‚Äôt take a quick moment to acknowledge Mary. 

As I was entering a new season in my life and recently losing a beloved pet, something in me was moved. Feeling lost and conflicted, I believe the Holy Spirit and God has called me back Home. Matthew 18:12
I started to attend every Sunday mass, pray the rosary, asking for intercession to Mary and St. Francis; which I have found deeply calming and restoring. I found Him again. On a deeper level than I ever imagined. 

So, I go on to tell them that I will no longer attend their church and will instead go back to the Catholic Church. While the response I received was cordial, heavily quoted with scripture, I was honestly offended and hurt. Essentially their responses insinuated that the Catholic Church, praying to Mary and saints I will not be saved because it takes away from God. 

I understand the roots of their religion; their views on Mary, our saints and religion overall. What‚Äôs upsetting is their flawed view that the Catholic faith somehow means you don‚Äôt know Jesus personally. The truth is, my relationship with Him has only deepened through the sacraments, the Eucharist, confession, prayer, Scripture, and the Church. I haven‚Äôt replaced surrender with tradition‚ÄîI‚Äôve surrendered more through it.
When people say you can‚Äôt find Jesus in Catholicism, I want to ask: have you actually looked? The Church doesn‚Äôt hide Him‚Äîit holds Him at the center of everything.

I did my own research on sola scriptura. But when Luther removed books from the Bible and others split off over disagreements, it made me question: are these views really based on the whole Word of God, or a version shaped by human rejection of authority?

Scripture never even claims to be the only authority. It promotes tradition, too. If we discard what Jesus gave us‚Äîthe Church, sacraments, apostolic teaching‚Äîwe‚Äôre missing part of Him. He didn‚Äôt leave us to walk alone with a book. He gave us a Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, to carry out His mission.

We‚Äôre UK based and Prior to this she was working part- time, active and in decent-ish health. She was in hospital having surgery to resolve a blood artery in her leg the week before, discharged home on the Sunday and the Tuesday morning, I went to her house early to check on her and found her slumped with obvious signs of a stroke (full right sided paralysis, unable to communicate etc). We were lucky in the sense that it was caught quickly as my dad had only just spoken to her 15 minutes ago when taking her a coffee. She was unable to have the clot busting medication due to the recent surgery so was blue lighted so the regional stroke centre and had a Thrombectomy within six hours of onset though not without a brain bleed and multiple crashes on the table. She‚Äôs since been diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation.

Her initially recovery was going well, she quickly regained significant movement in her affected limbs, could communicate with us clearly,  quickly moved up to eating fully again. She would have periods of expected confusion but they were manageable and she moved to a rehab facility 2 weeks after and this is where everything had just been going down hill. First it was confirmed the blood clots in her leg have returned and are untreatable which makes any kind of physiotherapy challenging as she has significant pain in that leg, but we were working with the vascular team to manage that pain in order to get her to a level of movement that could facilitate her being able to come home. 

However over the last week and a half her health has declined so rapidly. She picked up a UTI  and a skin infection which caused significant hallucinations and delirium which in ongoing. I truly don‚Äôt believe this was treated quickly enough, every NHS doctor and nurse we have seen has been trying their best, but it‚Äôs so clear they are under so much pressure and she has now developed  Sepsis with additional infection on her lungs, high heart rate and low blood pressure. She‚Äôs been moved back onto the ward she originally stayed on just after the stroke, back to being in a bed 24/7 with a catheter, hardly eating so she‚Äôs back on fluids, constantly swapping between crying her eyes out, being mad at the world and everyone in it, or having vivid hallucinations of people trying to harm her. It feels like every single slither of progress we made over the last 4 weeks has completely gone and we‚Äôre right back to the start. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience of set backs like this in the initial stages of recovery? Is there any hope that we can still have a positive outcome here? I know how serious her situation is, I know Stroke recovery is such a long road, and ultimately, life is never going to be the same again, but I‚Äôm desperately trying to find that glimmer of hope in the distance to keep me going because right now I have absolutely no idea what I‚Äôm doing or how I can help.

I had injured my back the day before and was struggling to get out of bed, so she ran to the window‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt see anyone outside.

At first, we thought it might just be another ding-dong-ditch prank. A few months ago, a group of neighborhood teens were doing that a lot. But there were two problems with that theory:

We didn‚Äôt think our doorbell even worked. It‚Äôs a digital one that the previous owners installed, and we‚Äôve never heard it ring before‚Äîeven when people were definitely at the door.

We have motion-sensor cameras on the front porch. Not only did we get no notifications, but there was also nothing on the footage‚Äîno movement, no one near the door.

Then it rang again‚Äîabout 20 minutes later.

This time I managed to get up, grabbed my pistol (more to let the person or persons on the other end that I was scared enough to grab it), and rushed outside. But again‚Ä¶ nothing. No one on the street, and still no motion alerts or footage on the cameras.

Over the next hour or so, it happened several more times. One time, I stood by the window watching both the porch and the live feed on my phone. My wife was also watching from her phone, and she swore she heard a faint laugh through the speaker‚Äîbut still, no one ever appeared on camera. It really seemed like someone was messing with us, but how?

Out of curiosity, I tested the doorbell myself, and it rang. So yes‚Äîit was working. But we had already confirmed when we moved in that the previous owners had deactivated all their accounts and disconnected the device from their system. We also do not have access to it. So how could anyone still have access to it?

Eventually, the ringing stopped and we managed to get some sleep.

Then, at around 6:30 AM, our kid was watching TV in the living room while my wife and I were still in bed, sipping coffee with the bedroom door open (we live in a single story ranch and can see the front door from our bedroom). The doorbell rang again. We immediately told our kid not to go near the door. It was daylight now, and once again‚Äîno one was visible on the camera footage.

Ten minutes later, it rang again.

I got up, looked outside‚Äînothing. At that point, I decided enough was enough. I looked up how to disconnect the doorbell and grabbed my tools. As I was walking toward the door to remove it, it rang again‚Äîright as I was opening up the door. And this time, I heard a voice.

It sounded like a man speaking through the doorbell speaker, but he wasn‚Äôt saying actual words‚Äîjust some kind of noise. It was deeply unsettling. We were now half-joking that the doorbell was possessed.

I went ahead and disconnected the device and removed its power source completely. I tested it afterward and confirmed‚Äîit was finally dead. No more ringing.

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a logical explanation here‚Ä¶ but the whole experience was incredibly creepy. The fact that it happened multiple times, with no one ever appearing on camera, and then a disembodied voice at the end‚Äîit definitely left us shaken.

1ma3fva,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ma3fva/why_should_aeropress_go_make_every_travelers/,Why should AeroPress Go make every traveler's favorite portable coffee maker review?,"The AeroPress 15A01 Coffee Maker is the portable sidekick you never knew you needed, especially if you're someone who loves their coffee as much as I do. I first got my hands on it after several disappointing attempts with lesser travel coffee makers. From camping trips to long work commutes, I‚Äôve put this compact, manual brewing wizard to the test in ways only a caffeine addict could dream of. Spoiler alert: it performed like a champ, but there were quirks.

**Compact and Smart Design**  
The first thing you'll notice is how compact and efficient the design is‚Äîtruly geared toward portability. With its included traveling case that doubles as a mug, it fits almost anywhere; I often slide it into my backpack‚Äôs side pocket. Measuring 4.2 inches wide and tall, with a weight of just 11.2 ounces, this has been my go-to for backpacking, road trips, and even long flights. While the matte grey finish gives it a slick, durable look, there‚Äôs a slight trade-off. The plunger design, though effective, does make you work for your coffee. If you‚Äôre not a fan of manual labor early in the morning, this might not be for you.

**Advantages**  
- Extremely portable and lightweight, making it perfect for travel.  
- Produces coffee without grit or bitterness‚Äîgreat for elevating morning taste buds.  
- Multi-functionality as it brews espresso-style, cold brew, and more within a couple of minutes.  

[Don‚Äôt miss AeroPress 15A01 deals‚Äîcheck Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07yvl8sf3/)  

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
I‚Äôve brewed hundreds of cups with this coffee press, experimenting with everything from super-fine espresso grinds to coarser setups. What stands out is how it avoids the bitterness or grittiness that you might experience with traditional French press coffee. Its ingenious use of pressure extraction means you‚Äôre left with a smoother, cleaner-tasting drink. Each brew takes about a minute, and the process is ridiculously straightforward: Add, stir, press, drink‚Äîit‚Äôs practically foolproof. That said, the paper filter design can be fiddly if you're not careful during cleanup.

**Build Quality and Durability**  
Designed in Silicon Valley (fancy, right?), the materials are BPA and phthalate-free. It‚Äôs survived multiple drops and camping mishaps without a scratch, which says a lot considering my history with breaking travel mugs. My only gripe is the plunger handle; it feels reinforced but not entirely ergonomic. After brewing multiple cups at a campsite, my wrist definitely needed a stretching session.

**Negatives**  
- Limited brewing size: Produces up to 8oz of coffee or a couple of shots of espresso per round, which won‚Äôt suffice for a group.  
- Paper filters, though effective, can be a hassle for storage during outdoor adventures.  
- The manual pressure required may not suit those seeking convenience or speed.

**Alternative Products**  
Comparing it to products like the Wacaco Nanopresso or Hario V60, the AeroPress stands apart in versatility. While the Nanopresso excels in cranking out true espresso-on-the-go, it feels more complex and comes with a steeper learning curve. Similarly, the Hario V60 produces great pour-over coffee but lacks portability and takes longer to brew. What puts this gadget at the top is that it combines multiple brewing methods (espresso, pour-over, and cold brew) into one travel-ready device. Still, if volumetric coffee quantities are a deciding factor, go for larger alternatives like the Espro French Press.

**Cost Effectiveness**  
Given its innovative brewing process and robust build, this product offers great **value for money**. You won‚Äôt get as much coffee per brew as you would with a French press, but it compensates with flavor variety and easy portability. In my opinion, it‚Äôs perfect for someone who prioritizes taste and compactness over output. Among all the other coffee-making gadgets I own, this one feels like it‚Äôs priced just right for its category.

1ma3els,https://www.reddit.com/r/finch/comments/1ma3els/i_made_some_daily_task_calendars_for_cleaning_and/,I made some daily task calendars (for cleaning and mental health),"TL;DR I made these two calendars with daily tasks to help me stay on top of my cleaning and mental health without so much decision fatigue and I wanted to share them. I highly recommend setting the ""Times per Day"" field by task difficulty to give yourself more motivation to do harder tasks, like deep cleaning the bathtub). Please leave suggestions for any tasks you are switching out in the comments!



I've been struggling a lot lately to keep my space clean and to remember to take time to enjoy life. I get stuck in a cycle of seeing messes build up and feeling guilty about them until the point where they start to become a problem, and then I'd deep clean my whole apartment. There would still always be something, though, that I'd walk by and feel guilty about ignoring. So I decided to make this calendar for myself to give myself permission to only focus on one cleaning task for the day. I've been using it for two months now, and found that I have the energy to deep clean one zone for about a week, and then the rest of the tasks, I just do the bare minimum. It's been so freeing to allow myself to ignore the mess piling up on the kitchen table when it's bathroom week. I love telling myself that ""that's not my problem today"". Life does get in the way, so I built in some rest and catch-up days so that you don't have to feel guilty about skipping something (though honestly, sometimes I skip whole weeks. It's fine though, no one is dying because of it). I also found that it helps to weigh the tasks by difficulty to give myself more motivation for the chores I particularly dislike.

It's been so helpful that I wanted to share it in case anyone else has found themselves in the same loop. I know everyone's needs will be different, so I'd really love it if people personalized the tasks and shared what they are adding in the comments!

I was also inspired by the self-care calendar that the finch team put out in January with daily tasks of fun things. I was kind of sad that they didn't keep that up for the following month, so I made my own and named it the Glimmer calendar. I wanted to make use of some of the features the finch app offers, so I linked some of the tasks to exercises as well. Most of the things are based on what I do and think about anyway, so it's nice to receive some extra recognition for them. I also made tasks that have a specific suggested duration like 15 minutes be 15 times per day.

Anyways, I hope you all enjoy the calendars and that they help you have a marginally cleaner and happier month! They do take a little while to set up but I, at least, have found them super worth it and I hope you do too <3

1ma3ap7,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1ma3ap7/just_my_personal_experience/,Just my personal experience.,"I‚Äôm a Non-US IMG, literally started from scratch and by from scratch I don‚Äôt mean I forgot some stuff from med school. It was like I never went. I also was doing my internship for the first 7 months of preparation period (the whole experience was 1 year and 3 months).

I studied the basics first from B&B and FA

-Sketchy for pharm and micro

-Pathoma for general pathology

-A little Dirty Medicine, random YouTube vids, and Osmosis here and there

After finishing basic sciences, I started systems from FA and B&B, but I only started UW halfway through my preparation because I wanted to have a foundation first before solving questions (kinda dumb but worked for me).

I finished ~70% of UW and then I took my first NBME (25) and scored (59%). At that time, I haven‚Äôt touched ethics or biostats, so I blamed my score on that lol.

I went back to revisit weak topics, doing random timed UW blocks (only did systems on tutor mode before), and studied ethics and biostats before taking the next NBME.

A month later of doing the above, I took (26, 27, and 28) and scored (63%, 64%, and 65% respectively) with 2‚Äì3 weeks between them. Improvement? Yes. Enough? No I wanted to hit (70+%) so I knew I had to change my ways. 

I studied Mehlman PDFs (almost all systems) and listened to his audio Qbank while showering, cooking, eating and whenever I could. I also worked on my exam taking skills, stamina, and timing. 

I then took (29) and scored (72%) 3 weeks before my exam, and then again (72%) on (30) 2 weeks before, and then AGAIN (72%) on (31) 10 days before test day.

Those scores gave me the confidence to take it easy, so I studied 3‚Äì4 hours max per day and rested very well, which made my exam day very comfortable.

5 days out, I took new free 120 and scored (73%) and reviewed it and continued on taking it easy before exam day.

2 days before the test I went to the salon and got my hair and nails done lol


The night before, I slept very well (already had a good sleep pattern) and woke up early, had my coffee (I usually skip breakfast) while watching the new Rick & Morty episode, and I listened to music on my way to the testing center. I took diclofenac right before starting to avoid headaches.

During the exam, I took a break after every single block during which I ate slices of apples and some cashews. I stayed hydrated with just few sips of water to avoid restroom breaks.

I did not experience headaches, loss of focus, fatigue, or sleepiness at all (again, good rest and good sleep).

The questions were very long and vague. Sometimes even if the question is clear, the answer choices were vague. I flagged 10‚Äì15 Qs per block, rushed through the last few questions in about 3 blocks . I felt like I guessed the majority of my answers, but honestly, it was very doable. Idk how I convinced myself I fucked up.

Post-exam, I felt happy and free, but as the days went by, I felt worse and even convinced myself I failed.

I think the main reasons I passed is because my exam experience was good! I didn‚Äôt feel tired or sleepy and that‚Äôs super important. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee passing, but it makes it easier.

My advice:

-Sleep. Like‚Ä¶ seriously, SLEEP and by that I don‚Äôt mean sleep 10+ hrs. Just have a good circadian  rhythm. 

-Time management > Panic management

-Take walks. Watch your favorite show daily. Reward yourself. You deserve it. 

I will be making separate posts about how I improved NBME scores and how I mastered biostats without Randy Neil vids 

Good luck everyone üíï

The fact that you can *just* enjoy something without reflecting on it (be it eating eggs for breakfast or listening to country music) is *the greatest achievement of culture*. In reality, so much work went into shaping you as a person with those particular tastes by forces in society that have real interests in your preferences. This idea seems pretty much accepted when it comes to taste in food; we all acknowledge that you have to acquire tastes for coffee, wine, etc. and have to train ourselves to know how to *taste* per se.

But it seems it has become disturbingly common to disparage the suggestion that you need to train your ear to listen to music in a particular way or watch a movie in a particular way, or read, etc. The result is an excessively pliant population always ready to be molded. The demise of the taste-making ""elitist"" critic has just meant their role is carried on by the money-hungry philistines of the culture industry.

No, you don't just ""like what you like"", and it should be totally acceptable to say so.

When choosing the hot water option there are no issues and dispenses correctly. Opened up the side panel and took it apart and did not notice anything out of the ordinary. When trying to brew any coffee I noticed dripping out of the front middle panel straight into the drip tray.

Cleaned the brew group completely (even though I maintain the machine weekly to make sure it is in peak condition). Can anyone help resolve the issue or should I just replace the machine? I may try to order a new brew group first. 

Would appreciate any insight as I have tried all I could find online. Thanks!",1,1753561008.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

And raw vegetables for dinner. I drink A LOT of water during the day, and I vape a decent amount during the day (ik I should quit). I have good muscle mass but it's covered up by decent fat. If I kept this same diet, would cardio help me burn all the fat? And if so, what type of cardio? 

It may look like I have a terrible diet but stress usually is what keeps me from losing weight. But my college class schedule has cleared up in the fall so I will have extra time to relax and get a workout in. In my opinion, I feel like I get a lot of protein in from Greek yogurt ( non-fat) around 2 cups for lunch.

I have lead a purposeless, friendless and soulless life; The thing that pulled me out of it wasn't a person who fixed me - it was me building relationships with friends and family. In turn, they started building a relationship with me.

Nurture your relationships. Every kind.  Start with your closest people - your mom, dad, siblings, close friends if they are available. Call, grab a cup of coffee together, drink some tea, many times it's already enough to be there. Be intentional about spending time. Is it awkward? Maybe - but you can bet on the fact that it won't be awkward after ten.

Expand your connections - don't fear your own awkwardness. People know that I am weird - I've been awkward and stupid more times than I can count. But I was always genuine and honest. People see that - and other honest and genuine people will appreciate you for it, despite your awkwardness. Be unapologetically yourself, and open up.

Put kindness first - understand, connect and be open to receive other perspectives. That is something I struggled with - People perceive the world differently, and sometimes they seem to be against your internal values. I've learned that most people do have reasons. The world is not - cannot be - black and white.

Finally, you will be a wonderful male role model to your peers. Your internal values - sharpened, steadied and built over countless interactions and discussions - allow you to be firm, non-compromising and unwavering. All while being kind, gentle and compassionate. In turn, people will trust you more than anyone else.

If you're there for people, you'll find those who return your kindness - and they will help you find purpose, love and happiness. You can do it ü´Ç",8,1753560970.0,infp,1,0.91,False

Silence‚Ä¶ It was completely silent as I gazed out the window, towards the sky. A plane was flying in the sky, it had 2 fighter jets and a stealth jet, they resembled a Boeing F-47, the other one resembled B-21 Raider. A fighter jet at both sides and the stealth jet at the front. The plane they seemed to be escorting looked like one of those that would carry a lot of cargo, it looked like foreign military.

I sipped at my coffee. I knew what was coming, but I didn‚Äôt panic. Afterall I‚Äôve lived a fulfilling life, experienced all there was to experience in this life.

The bottom of the plane opened and a small object fell out. My gaze following it as it descended. Getting closer to the ground, but before it could get to close it exploded, forming a mushroom cloud.

I knew there was nothing I could do to change my current circumstances. I couldn‚Äôt save myself from something like this.

I watched as the shockwave got closer and closer. And before I knew it, I died.

¬†

**???**

I blinked. My eyes adjusting to the bright light.

*‚ÄòAm I not supposed to be dead? How am I alive. And where am I? did I actually reincarnate!?‚Äô*

I looked around the room. While looking around the room I spotted a mirror. Standing up to take a look at my appearance, to see if anything had changed.

Looking at my reflection, I was shocked. I looked like a younger version of Rover from Wuthering Waves. I snapped my gaze towards the window and rushed over taking a look outside. Expecting an advanced civilization, I was met with just a normal modern neighborhood. The one thing standing out from what I could see were the people, some had animal features others had weird colored skin, and multicolored hair dotted out the small crowd outside going about their day.

*‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on? Those are people and the one with animal features don‚Äôt resemble any echo or tacet discord I know of. People in Solaris-3 don‚Äôt have these kinds of unique characteristics among any of the known areas, even Rinascita doesn‚Äôt host these kinds of unique people. This isn't Solaris-3. Which world am I in.‚Äô*

I looked back at the room spotting the computer. Walking over and taking a seat, I searched the first thing that came to mind, ‚ÄòAll Might‚Äô. Why did I search that? Because \[My Hero Academia\] is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about unique people.

Immediately after I searched for All Might, a ton of results popped up. Number one hero. Strongest hero. Most popular hero.

I leaned back in the chair while groaning.

*‚ÄòWhy of all the worlds did I end up in \[MHA\], I don‚Äôt want to play hero, villains are overrated to. What can I do in this world? Should I create the Black shores? Create the Fractsidus and create some excitement in this boring black and white world tinged with a bit of grey? Something to consider.‚Äô*

It feels amazing to have experienced this with her. We recently have been working on hearing/understanding each other more. 

Recently i have felt as if my wife can‚Äôt emotionally validate how I feel. It almost feels like she is trying to dictate how I feel. She was abused as a child, anxious attachment disorder, ADHD and dyslexia. These are topics that are in our conversation allot as she brings up her experiences so I can understand  how she feels+her process. I am really trying to create tools or understand how she can feel emotionally heard as well. 

But we‚Äôve hit this roadblock. Recently we got In an argument about how my wife hasn‚Äôt been hearing me.  

Me ‚ÄúHoney I‚Äôm sorry I was so excited to start the day I didn‚Äôt hear you. I didn‚Äôt realize that this dream you had was terrible. I didn‚Äôt hear you clearly when you told me you had a bad dream. I‚Äôm sorry that I misheard you.‚Äù

Wife ‚ÄúI hear that you don‚Äôt care about me and that I should just keep to myself because I‚Äôm all I have‚Äù 

Me ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I said. I just didn‚Äôt hear you when you were talking to me. We just woke up and I was getting up to make us coffee. What can I do to make you feel more heard, validated and understood?‚Äù

Wife: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe answering that question‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúOk I just don‚Äôt know what to do then to help you feel safe. I‚Äôm trying to do everything I can to make you feel comfortable to talk to me about what you need‚Äù

Wife ‚ÄúYeah I can definitely say there‚Äôs lots of trying‚Äù

This has escalated into me laying out a boundary of allowing me to feel my feelings. I told her it is not ok for anyone to tell me how I should feel. I‚Äôm doing a ton of internal self confidence work currently, and if I say something directly help/hurts me, I believe it should be valued by my spouse. Am I wrong? I want tools because when our relationship is in good standing, it‚Äôs soo good. She is the love of my life. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever been happier with anyone else, and I‚Äôm willing to work to make this relationship feel like everyday we spend together is the best day.

 I just feel like I‚Äôm missing something, and when I: ask directly what she needs, ask her to write down how she feels so I can read and understand, give me examples of what felt good/bad, validate how I feel‚Ä¶I hit the wall. Advice would be greatly appreciated üôè

The past couple of months, I‚Äôve had the Instant Pot Vortex 140-3088-01 in my kitchen, and to say it has been a game-changer would be an understatement. This 6-quart air fryer boasts incredible versatility, with 6-in-1 functionality that lets you air fry, broil, roast, reheat, dehydrate, and bake‚Äîall in a single appliance. It's not just another gadget taking up counter space; it‚Äôs become an essential tool I rely on daily.

**Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things I noticed was the sleek black design, which looks great in almost any modern kitchen. Its compact build, despite a hefty 6-liter capacity, ensures it doesn‚Äôt hog my counter space, leaving room for my coffee maker and other essentials. The ClearCook window and internal light are standout features. Being able to monitor the progress of my crispy wings or roasted veggies without pulling out the basket makes cooking far less intrusive.

[Check Instant Pot Vortex 140-3088-01 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b096n3ftzp/)

I did have some concerns about the outer material being plastic. While it hasn‚Äôt shown any wear or tear yet, I‚Äôll admit, I was worried about long-term durability when I first unpacked it. For its weight of approximately 11.35 pounds, it feels sturdy. The appliance also features non-stick surfaces in the tray and basket, which are not only functional but dishwasher safe. Cleaning it after a late-night snack experiment is genuinely hassle-free.

**Ease of Use**

This machine is beginner-friendly. Even for someone like my cousin (who isn‚Äôt exactly the most tech-savvy person), the touch control method and customizable programs bring simplicity to the table. It includes special one-touch smart programs for items like wings, cookies, and roasted potatoes. My nephew, who‚Äôs only 11, even made cinnamon buns using one of the pre-programmed settings, and they came out surprisingly perfect.

The quiet cooking added an unexpected bonus. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I despised the loud noise of some kitchen appliances until I used this air fryer. Whether I‚Äôm meal-prepping for the week or whipping up dinner on a busy weekday evening, the minimal noise makes the process so much more enjoyable.

**Cooking Performance: Crispy Results Every Time**

Cooking with this air fryer is a breeze, thanks to EvenCrisp technology. I‚Äôve air-fried fries, roasted chicken legs, and even broiled salmon, and every single dish had that golden, crispy exterior while staying tender inside. My mother, who‚Äôs particular about her food textures, said it‚Äôs the crispiest yet fluffiest garlic potatoes she‚Äôs ever had. Advanced airflow delivers incredible consistency, doing all of this with 95% less oil than traditional frying methods.

The programmable temperature range is a key factor, spanning from 95 to 400¬∞F. It transitions smoothly between custom temperatures, ensuring I could experiment with dehydrating apples one day and preparing roasted veggies at high heat the next. Having the progress bar showing me exactly when to add and turn food made it feel like I had my own kitchen assistant.

**Advantages**

- ClearCook window and built-in light help monitor cooking without interruptions.  
- Versatile cooking options with 6-in-1 functionality.  
- EvenCrisp technology ensures crispy results with minimal oil.  
- Dishwasher-safe basket and tray simplify clean-up.  
- Minimal preheating, perfect for quick meals.  

**Shortcomings**

- The plastic outer material gives the impression it might not withstand long-term heavy use.  
- Its size and footprint may still be a bit large for smaller kitchens.  
- During the initial couple of uses, there was a faint plastic smell, though it disappeared after I ran the ""burn off"" process.  

**Product Comparisons**

Having tested other air fryers such as the Ninja Foodi and Philips Premium Digital Airfryer, I can confidently say the Instant Pot Vortex holds its ground well. The Ninja Foodi does come with some additional pressure cooking functionality, but it‚Äôs also heavier, bulkier, and significantly more expensive. The Philips model impressed me with its slightly faster preheating, but it lagged behind in terms of capacity, which was frustrating when cooking for larger crowds. The Instant Pot Vortex offers a perfect mix of features and practicality, making it an ideal choice for the price-conscious buyer.

**Affordable Quality**

When weighing its features against others in the market, this air fryer stands out for its ability to balance cost efficiency and quality. The inclusion of customizable cooking presets, a ClearCook window, EvenCrisp technology, and easy-to-clean components makes it a great choice for families who want something affordable yet functional. While exact pricing fluctuates, its feature set puts it in a tier that‚Äôs worth every penny for budget-conscious home cooks.
