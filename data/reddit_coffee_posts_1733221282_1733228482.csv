1h5m4hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanna/comments/1h5m4hy/kanna_is_unwerwhelming/,Kanna is unwerwhelming,"Yes this post is just an annecdotal report but I feel like I have read far too many positive reviews..

1. I know what a serotonergic buzz or dopaminergic buzz feel like from past experiences
2. despite this I have no stim cross tolerance
3. I bought the nootropicdepot kanna pills

I tried ""primming"" for a week at 15mg sublingual

I felt an effect from day 1, the effect peak at \~30 mins and is meh.

4) I felt no primming, same response from day one to day 6

There is a slight head buzz but it is weaker than e.g. bromantane, which already is not very potent.

I feel zero stimulation (energy, motivational salience) increase from my sober state

I feel no hedonic increase (smiling, music enhancement, joy, etc)

There might be a slight relaxation but it feels non potent

The buzz is a slight alteration of consciousness (you know its there as a discrete background feeling) but this buzz feels useless.

Moreover the effect is short lived like 1-2hours max

I've tried 25mg sublingual with no much improvement.

so is it individual differences? Are the nootropicdepot pills bad? Does primming require longer duration?

note I have always taken it with coffee. I take zero drugs in my life (don't even drink alcohol)",1,1733228337.0,Kanna,0,1.0,False

1h5m3cl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1h5m3cl/galantamine_is_no_joke/,Galantamine is no joke,"I had a few short, shitty LDs after 9 months of diligent practice; detailed dream journaling whenever I had a dream, frequent reality checks (which so far in dreams have passed, meaning they worked as they would in real life), as much ADA as I can and even meditation, some basic supplementation like vitamins. Healthy sleep schedule. WBTB every night (due to natural awakenings).

Finally got my hands on some galantamine and I gotta say, that shit is just bananas. I have had vivid dreams quite like this, but they were random and I suppose just the culmination of ""just right"" dietary and sleep conditions that I was not actively taking part in. But this was so goddamn real. I may as well have been in another dimension.

I was climbing up this little forest trail and I mean, I felt the wind, I felt the dirt crumbling beneath my hands (I was on all fours for whatever reason), the cold soil staining it, the clothes on my body, every leaf crunching, birdsong, I even got out of breath as I went up. And I thought ""I'll be at the top soon"" and I was. There was this totally serene and beautiful sunrise over these mountain tops and this little city below, with dozens of people from my life all walking around unaware of one another. I could see IN to their homes, not in a pervy way I could just observe their life in detail. One guy was making coffee, one guy was taking out the trash, two girls were walking their dogs. All so close together. It was like I was able to see everything. It was like my entire reality was MC Escher works except I could sort of control it.

But here's the kicker, I wasn't even that aware. Flying is great but it wasn't my primary goal. And believe me it was very peaceful and fun. And neat to look into the world like that. Then I had some inception type dreams where I woke up in another place and had to explain to the dream characters what I was doing. I wasn't lucid for that at all but it was just as realistic if not a bit more phantasmagoric.

TL;DR

i got drunk at thanksgiving, on the drive home, i don’t remember much, but i remember crying and asking my boyfriend why he was being so mean to me, and he screamed back “because you’re fucking pissing me off” and then threw something at me. i feel scared and upset. we haven’t talked about that situation and i want to. but i don’t know how.

One minute, something's “cool,” and the next, it’s yesterday’s news. There’s this pressure to be part of it all, like if you don’t follow the crowd, you’re somehow left behind. But, when did it all become about what’s *in* instead of what feels *right* to us? 

Sometimes, it feels like trends make us forget the simple joys that aren’t attached to any social media buzz or hashtag. Why can’t we just enjoy the little things without needing them to fit into some bigger picture? That quiet walk with a coffee, the book you can’t put down, or the way your cat curls up on your lap—these small, untrendy moments are often the ones that make life feel complete.

We’re all unique, and what brings us happiness doesn’t always have to be loud, flashy, or trending. In fact, the things we truly love often don’t need the world’s validation. It’s okay to not follow every new wave. The real trend is finding the beauty in being yourself, without worrying if it’s “in” or “out.” So, let’s slow down, embrace the untrendy, and live in the moments that actually make our hearts smile.

1h5lx8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1h5lx8x/six_months_without_my_smartphone_at_home/,Six Months Without My Smartphone at Home,"Six months ago, I made a bold decision: I swapped my smartphone for a dumbphone as my primary device and set strict rules for how I use technology. It was an effort to break free from my smartphone addiction while still making the best use of it in the office for essential tasks, like using authentication apps.

Rule 1. I don’t bring my smartphone home. 

Rule 2. I only use digital devices—my smartphone and laptop—in the office.

These rules seem pretty simple, but even to this day I still struggle to stick to them!

Here's how these simple rules have changed my life: 

1. Better sleep: Without a smartphone, there’s nothing to scroll at night. My sleep jumped from 6-7 hours to 7-8, and my mornings now start with breakfast and calm, not emails.

2. More writing: My dumbphone, paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, has become my distraction-free writing space. No notifications, just creativity.

3. More family time: Evenings are for conversations and laughter with my husband, not separate screens. It’s brought us closer.

4. Healthier habits: To my great surprise, cutting back screen time helped me grow new healthy habits that I wasn't able to develop for many years. I’ve started meal-prepping, working out 3-4 times a week, hiking with friends, and cutting back on coffee. 

5. No more self-hate: Last but not least, this has been the biggest achievement for me so far. Whenever I found myself doom-scrolling, I felt so bad about myself and felt like I was wasting my life away. Now, I may doom scroll on weekends or at night every once in a while, but then the next day I will remember to leave my smartphone at the office.

1h5lvo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h5lvo7/aita_for_trying_to_change_furniture_while_moving/,AITA for trying to change furniture while moving,"So the story goes that I’m moving into my friends apartment. He’s lived there for a while now has had floating roommates and the apartment is very minimally furnished. The couch is a leather couch that was already bought used four years ago. It’s okay, I suppose, it’s something we both agreed that should probably get replaced. There are other pieces of furniture that follow in the same lines. A leather chair, used significantly less, in the corner sort of forgotten. A glass table that is incredibly unstable and all of our friends hate using. 

I’m finding a lot of issues trying to get new furniture let alone bring my old things in. I have a really nice coffee table that I want to use but he doesn’t like the idea of getting rid of his. I’ve never asked him to get rid of anything, the couch is the closest but that was more agreed upon. 

The glass table is small, I like to have people over for magic, DND, board games or just hanging out, impossible with the current table. When I brought up the idea of changing the table he got very defensive regarding that he has to get rid of his stuff and what is he going to do for his next move, valid I understand.

Every conversation about the couch has to be vetted by him for design, color, comfiness, otherwise it’s a no and I gotta keep looking. I’m paying for all this. I stated and he’s well aware that I’d be paying for this furniture, all on my own. Eventually I decided I wanted a bigger couch that would fit in our space so I decided to not peruse that. 

The only conversation that has gone fluidly is the one regarding a new TV I considered because I love watching movies on my surround system. He asked me if I could/wanted to keep the current TV in my room which i said okay but there was no issue here. 

So I’m just finding a hard time to maneuver this conversation and I’m unsure if I’m being an asshole, asserting my right to a shared space, or just something else. I don’t want to leave him with no furniture, that’s not the plan. I just want to have a more adult living room that doesn’t look like a bachelor pad. We’re 29 going on 30, I just feel like if I want to spend my hard earned money on things I plan to keep for my hopeful future house compared to used uncared for furniture that ultimately benefit both of us it shouldn’t be this hard 

I also want to add but it may not be important that he’s been even pushing back on things I had in my previous living room. Stuff like my piano with its stand, designed to be left in the living, had to get approval. My collectibles like legos, miniatures I painted, or figured I’ve collected, are limited to “1 or 2”. I’ve expressed that it feels more like I’m expected to move into his space rather than us agreeing to share it.",1,1733227446.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

I’ve been using the Pixel Buds A for a while now with a pixel 6a, and while they’re great in many ways, their performance during calls in noisy environments is honestly terrible. It’s frustrating because I take a lot of calls on the go, and background noise almost always overwhelms my voice, making it hard for the person on the other end to hear me.

I’ve been considering upgrading to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, but the most critical feature for me is voice isolation during calls in noisy settings (think coffee shops, streets, or public transport). I know they likely have better sound quality and noise cancellation for listening, but how do they handle calls specifically?

If you’ve tried the Pixel Buds Pro 2, can you share your experience with their voice isolation? Is it good enough to clearly separate your voice from background noise? Would you recommend them as an upgrade for this use case?

For just over a month I've been experiencing rectal pain ranging from no feeling / discomfort to mild pain over the course of the day. At its worst, It feels enflamed. About 2 weeks after feeling the rectal discomfort/pain, I also gained a symptoms of feeling to urinate when I don't necessarily need too and pee'ing a lot when I drink moderates amount. (Before I had a very strong bladder and wouldn't get urges unless I purposefully drank a lot)

I gave a stool sample which came back as abnormal with 505 calprotectin level and have been referred to a Gastronomist. I have no blood/mucus in my stool from what I can see, stools come out overly normal and I don't think I have constipation, no ulcers in mouth and bloods, urine come back normal from GP. No history of IBD/IBS in family and any food doesn't seem to change my bowl movements or pain from what I've noticed.

I did have Norovirus shortly before I gave my stool sample so I wonder if it may have given a raised reading because of this?

I had a weird sensation of feeling light headed and weakness yesterday which seemed to come on randomly after I had a coffee which somewhat persisted into today, however I am not sure if it's fatigue, because I am not bed bound and went and walked the dogs and may go tot he gym. Doc thinks it's not related to my rectal/bladder issue.

I was trying to find someone I can vibe with, and we did. She expressed that she is attracted to me, even I complimented her.
One day when one of those girls tried to convince me for relationship i got fed up and talked to her and regarding this.
I asked why don't you want relationship she replied with it is lot of work.
Then i asked to FWB. To which she said let's see.
Then slowly we had our first kiss and then it was a routine to makeout after office.
But then she noticed me once talking to that girl, she initiated the conversation and it was about work.
My FWB noticed and while we're making out she said, ""We hold hands, we hugged is this casual""
I replied ""That's what we like""
She Replied ""This is casual""
I got a little annoyed because after our first kiss the next day she said ""If this gets emotional what we will do?""
I replied with "" If it goes that way it goes that way""
She said ""If this gets emotional and you talked to her(The girl who used to hit on me) I will fuck you ass""
I replied""If you flirt with your frnd(Not attractive married men maybe 29), I will fuck you""
She laughes and gave me a kiss again.

After like 10 days of kissing regularly she used to come with excuses that she have to go home early, her dad is strict but it wasn't until those 10 days.
And previously we used to take our breaks together, but then it also got stopped I used to text her talk to her but responses started to get delayed and one word.
I confronted her regarding this after a week when I wasn't able to take it anymore, I asked regarding this and she said I think casual means keeping the communication to minimum and then I asked about kiss and she said she is able to make time for this, i asked you have time for your frnd but not 15 min for me. She kept quit and said for the sake of saying ""Acha, I am sorry meri galti hogai, it's not working let's end this"" I replied let's end this it's not working"".
She said ""let's see I am coming in your team, maybe we will get time"".
I wasn't able to control my emotions and i kissed her"" we were in public place but no one was there she took me to a corner and said ""It looks like you need a Girlfriend"" i said not I just want you.
Then i said her on text ""I am sorry that I got emotional I will keep my distance from now on"".
When I was distancing myself she was frustrated and talked to rudly.
After that discussion maybe 2 days after she msged me that you are ignoring me and no one is at my home, it was 3 AM.
I wasn't expecting sex because of the heated conversation but I thought maybe. When I pick her form her house as cousins were there not her father, she said let's book a room it's too cold outside.
And then things happened.
That day went well even at the office, but from next day as I talk to everyone including that girl. She got angry and said why her when you have me. I agreed an promised her I won't be even around her anymore.
But things didn't changed and she kept ghostingn me online and offline. I wasn't able to talk to anyone after this. I used to be alone all the time. After 11-12 days i msg her and told ""let's end this there is not point in having this if you don't have time for me"" then she said no, I made a plan she improvised and we a night together. I tried to communicate regarding this issue but she stopped and told "" emotions me nahi behna hai"". And then the same pattern is continued but now she isn't having eye contact with me not replying to text, keeping on seen. I texted twice but then i stopped. 
I absconded the company i can't be there anymore on my last few days i heard her saying "" If he(someone ) didn't said yes, he is always there"". 
I am not able to get over this its already been 5-6 days but still I can't keep thinking about her and those moments we had and on those dates she used to pay.
I am having nightmares, I can't imagine her with someone else, the thought is also ripping me apart.

Firstly I'd like to say MJ has changed my life. I'm 35 years old and have spent the past 5 years battling with my weight and I can't put into words the toll this took on me. I was in the deepest throws of depression, nothing worked. Didn't recognise myself in the mirror or any photos of me. 

I lost 2.5 stone myself 3 years ago, with a goal weight of 5 stone to loose and spent 3 years just maintaining that 2.5 stone, every time I came off my diet it would be 10-12 lbs on and horrendous cycles of binge eating etc. 

Fast forward to 7 weeks ago i started MJ with the goal to eat healthy, hit protein fibre goals etc and be in a daily 1000 kcal defecit - so 1200-1400 kcals a day. 

It's worked like an absolute charm and I'm now 16.5 lbs down, 2 off my 3 stone in total. To see the scales going down every day, losing consistently 2 lbs a week and having no food noise has been a dream 

That being said, I moved up to 5mg two weeks ago and noticed after taking the 'golden dose' of my last 2.5mg pen, which I'm assuming was a little bit more than the 2.5 mg dose (which I was fine with as I knew I was moving up), that appetite suppression has kicked in ten fold. 

I don't desire any foods at all to the point where the thought of almost every food group makes me feel a bit sick. I'm sitting writing my shopping list for this week and I'm at a loss what to buy. The only things I can stomach are coffee and pomegranate 

This obviously isn't ideal and I promised myself I would loose weight in a healthy and sustainable way. The last thing I want is to cause more issues for myself when I come off the medication. 
Will this likely subside? I have emailed med express and explained my situation and asked if I should go back down to 2.5mg. 

Has anyone else tried dropping back down a dose to help combat this and if so, did it work? 

I have had no side effects other than feeling like I've had about seven red bulls daily in the first few weeks, I do also suffer with anxiety so felt this was slightly heightened whenever I had a coffee, but that has subsided for the most part. 

Any advice would be so much appreciated

It is so freaking convenient , i regret not using it before.

Although  it is not directly compatible , alternatives are pretty good . Thats what i use to connect any non homekit device  to home app ,. so it works for me . The one thing i love the most is that it is multi-purpose , any device i want , i can connect to Home App. It gives me some rest that i really love.

She’s passionate about helping fellow designers grow their careers and shares her expertise through educational video content. In her latest project, Kelsey used [Coohom](https://www.coohom.com/pub/market/account/signup?utm_source=googlead&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=B2C_Search_InteriorDesigner_USA_EN_20241203), a powerful 3D design software, to redesign a pantry for a tech company in Manhattan.

The Challenge: Transforming an Outdated Pantry

Kelsey’s client, a vibrant tech company, needed to update their office pantry. The space was small, outdated, and didn’t reflect the company’s modern, collaborative culture. The goal was to create a functional, stylish space where employees could socialize, host events, and grab snacks during the workday. The client’s branding featured blue, pink, and purple, which Kelsey incorporated into the design.

https://preview.redd.it/lax63pdxbm4e1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d9ce1e0f23fb801510577780b5d610edf70cbe6

The Design Process

Step 1: Assessing Client Needs

Kelsey started by interviewing the client to understand their specific needs. The pantry needed to:

\- Offer storage for snacks and coffee for employees.

\- Provide a social space for birthdays, holiday parties, and informal work.

\- Reflect the company’s fun and youthful brand.

https://preview.redd.it/5g577kjzbm4e1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f0abe0e7cfd00e40c6f0760cf0ff00bdc4b159d

Step 2: Drawing Inspiration

Kelsey created mood boards using the company’s branding colors: blue, pink, and purple. She drew inspiration from these colors and modern design elements, like blue base cabinets and pink upper cabinets, to craft a playful and cohesive aesthetic that matched the company’s culture.

https://preview.redd.it/169un773cm4e1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=362070e6a7be04aef1b281a76d1bbf419ba08e28

Step 3: Floor Planning with AutoCAD

Using AutoCAD, Kelsey drafted the floor plan to ensure functionality. She maintained the original plumbing layout for cost-efficiency but made key adjustments to the space:

\- Base cabinets were placed near the window for natural light.

\- Tall pantry cabinets were added for snack storage.

\- An island with seating was included to foster collaboration and casual meetings.

Step 4: Modeling and Rendering with [Coohom](https://www.coohom.com/pub/market/account/signup?utm_source=googlead&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=B2C_Search_InteriorDesigner_USA_EN_20241203)

After finalizing the layout, Kelsey used Coohom’s 3D design tools to bring the pantry to life. By importing her AutoCAD floor plan into Coohom, Kelsey could quickly create a 3D model of the space. Coohom’s vast library of furniture and materials allowed her to easily adjust finishes, such as white marble for the base cabinets and a playful pink for the upper cabinets, to match the design vision.

Kelsey appreciated how Coohom’s rendering features helped her visualize the space in detail, making it easier to present the design to the client. The 3D renderings provided a clear view of the space, helping the client see the final result before construction began.

The Result: A Functional, Collaborative Pantry

The finished pantry was a vibrant, functional space that reflected the company’s brand. The playful blue and pink cabinets, along with the island and seating, created an inviting atmosphere for employees. [Coohom](https://www.coohom.com/pub/market/account/signup?utm_source=googlead&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=B2C_Search_InteriorDesigner_USA_EN_20241203)’s easy-to-use tools streamlined Kelsey’s design process, helping her deliver a high-quality result on time.

Conclusion: [Coohom](https://www.coohom.com/pub/market/account/signup?utm_source=googlead&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=B2C_Search_InteriorDesigner_USA_EN_20241203)’s Role in the Design Process

Coohom played a crucial role in streamlining Kelsey’s design process. The ability to import AutoCAD files, quickly generate 3D models, and easily customize elements helped Kelsey work efficiently and present her ideas clearly to the client. By using Coohom, Kelsey was able to save time and deliver a high-quality, realistic rendering that ensured the client’s satisfaction. Coohom’s tools made the design process faster, more efficient, and ultimately helped bring the client’s vision to life.

Now that, that’s out the way. 

Would you choose coffee from a Nespresso machine (not virtuo) or a really shitty espresso machine, I mean worst of the worst (still 9 bar pressure tho) but one of those ones with the pressurised portafilter and thick boi steam wands?

My thinking is, I could probably still find a replacement portafilter and even pre ground beans with the pressurised portafilter > than anything in those little 7g capsules from Nespresso.",0,1733224295.0,espresso,6,0.5,False

We’re not exactly what you’d call *visionaries*. Don’t get me wrong—if your car’s making a weird noise, or your tires are balder than my Uncle Keith, we’re your guys. But cutting-edge technology? Precision engineering? Anything involving the words “nuclear deterrent”? Not so much.

So when I tell you I was sitting in the break room of the Crawley branch, halfway through a bacon bap and a dodgy vending machine coffee, and my manager burst in, looking like he’d seen a ghost, you’ll understand why my first thought wasn’t “Oh, we’ve landed a billion-pound submarine contract.”

“Danny,” he said, breathless, pointing a finger at me like I’d just robbed a bank.

“What?” I muttered around a mouthful of bacon.

“Head office just called. We’re in the papers.”

Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever worked at Kwik Fit, but let me tell you: the only time you end up in the papers is if you’ve cocked something up royally. You fitted someone’s wheels backward, or maybe a stray hubcap took out a pensioner. So naturally, my gut sank.

“What’d we do this time?” I asked.

He didn’t answer. Just threw the paper down on the table. It was the *Telegraph*, which already felt wrong. Kwik Fit doesn’t make the *Telegraph*. The *Sun*? Sure. The *Mirror*? On occasion. But this was the big leagues.

And there it was, right on the front page:

**“Kwik Fit to Build Britain’s Next Nuclear Submarine”**

I stared at the headline, blinking, half convinced it was some kind of elaborate Photoshop job. Then I read the subheading: *‘Tyre Experts Beat Out Defense Giants in MOD Tender Error.’*

I couldn’t stop myself. I laughed. A proper, chest-shaking, coffee-spraying laugh that only made my manager’s face redder.

“This has to be a joke,” I said, wiping my mouth. “Right?”

“Do I look like I’m joking, Danny?”

I squinted at him. He did not look like he was joking.

“Hang on a minute,” I said, holding up the paper. “You’re telling me we’ve got a contract to build a submarine? Like, an actual bloody submarine? Nuclear, as in... bombs?”

He nodded grimly.

“But we don’t even have a bloody marine department! The closest we’ve come to water is fitting snow tires in Dundee!”

“Tell that to head office,” he snapped. “They want you to go up there. Today. Apparently, you’re our ‘most experienced fitter.’” He did air quotes around the last bit, which stung more than it should have.

“Me? What the hell am I supposed to do? I’ve never even seen a submarine, let alone built one!”

“You and me both, mate,” he said, already walking out. “But someone up there thinks you’re qualified. So finish your bap and pack a bag. You’re off to London.”

The rest of the day was a blur. One minute, I was swapping out brake pads on a knackered Ford Focus; the next, I was on a train to headquarters, wearing my oil-stained overalls and feeling about as prepared for this meeting as a cat at Crufts.

When I got there, the boardroom was packed. Regional managers, PR reps, even a couple of Ministry of Defence suits who looked like they wanted to throttle someone. They all turned to stare at me as I walked in, clutching my toolbox like it was a security blanket.

“Uh... Danny Price,” I said, clearing my throat. “Tyre fitter. Crawley branch.”

One of the PR people—some slick-looking bloke with a Bluetooth headset—sighed loudly and muttered, “This is who they send?”

“Oi,” I shot back, “I didn’t ask to be here, alright? I’m as confused as you lot.”

The room erupted into chaos. Some bloke in a suit was ranting about “reputational damage” and “how the hell did this get past quality assurance?” A woman in a pencil skirt was trying to spin it as “a charming David and Goliath story,” which just made the MOD guy’s face go purple.

Eventually, someone banged a gavel—or maybe it was just the table; I wasn’t really paying attention—and the room fell quiet.

“Alright,” said the man at the head of the table, clearly the big boss. “Let’s get one thing straight. We didn’t ask for this contract. It was a clerical error. The MOD screwed up, not us.”

The purple-faced MOD guy bristled but said nothing.

“But,” the boss continued, “now it’s out there. The press knows. Parliament knows. Hell, even the Americans probably know. So the question is, how do we fix this?”

I raised my hand.

“What?” the boss snapped.

“Well,” I said slowly, “why don’t we just... tell them we can’t do it? I mean, it’s not like we actually know how to build a submarine.”

There was a long pause. Then the PR guy smirked.

“Actually,” he said, “that’s not the worst idea. Play the underdog card. Make it a story about ordinary blokes taking on the impossible.”

The MOD guy groaned. “You want us to trust *tyre fitters* with national security?”

“Well,” I said, grinning despite myself, “we do offer a lifetime guarantee.”",1,1733224249.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I a 24 M, and my girlfriend a 24 F, we went on a date a few months back, a movie date to be exact like we always do, before we go see a movie we always have lunch. While having lunch in a Korean BBQ restaurant I suddenly fell unwell. I started to heat up and asked my girlfriend if I was having a fever. She confirmed that I did have a fever she said that my forehead was super hot and I felt the air from my nose getting hotter as well. So I started to eat faster so I could relax, I asked my girlfriend that after the movie I needed to go home because I think my fever was getting worse. She replied that ""No, after we go shopping a little then we can go home"". Well here is the hard part of me, I couldn't say no and pulled through so I said ""ok fine but after that, we head straight home"". 

So after we ate, we watched the movie. After the movie, I was not looking great. I was weak, my entire body was feeling heavy, couldn't walk fast, and my head was killing me. So I said to my girlfriend that I was getting worse by the minute and needed to go home. She said ""Please let's go shopping it will be quick"", so like I said I cannot say no, then proceeded to go to the department store, after I agreed she was walking fast and saw me slowly walking like a sloth because of the fever, she had the audacity to tell me to carry her stuff and tell me to be strong because she cant carry me so meaning she can't help me and that's reassuring my situation, I barely had the strength to keep focus and yet carry everything. So that angry part of me came and I snatched her bag and water bottle angrily right when she was giving it to me, then she started getting angry herself, I dont know if she got the message of my situation and why I got angry when I calmed down I followed her and said I am sorry and she was not speaking to me.

She went to a coffee shop and ordered some Iced coffee, again the audacity she asked me to carry it. To show her I was sorry, I held it for her. When we arrived at the department store I dont remember how long it took but for me, she took ages to shop. When she paid for her stuff she finally wanted to go home, we were walking back to my car but then she saw something in the bookstore and told me to ""Wait I wanna look at something"", and again I couldn't say no. Again I dont remember how long she took because of the fever and again for me, she took ages inside the shop. I was barely able to stand up, I put my head against the wall and shut my eyes to help me relax while holding the things she bought from the department store and her Iced coffee. 

Some guards approached and asked me if I was ok because they saw me struggling to stand up and breathe, and my eyes were shut. I told them I was just waiting for my girlfriend in the bookstore, I couldn't come in because there was a sign that said no food or drinks since I was holding her Iced coffee. So the guards left but kept an eye on me just in case.

 Eventually, my girlfriend was finished at the bookstore, and thank goodness she did not taught to buy anything else. She was a little worried about if I could drive. Luckily even when I feel sick as long as I am driving I dont feel ill so I can focus on my driving, I focus on driving as fast as I can, when I dropped her at her house, she just said goodbye and drive safely. Then I eventually got home, parked the car, changed clothes, freshened up a little, and headed straight to bed. So am I the asshole?",3,1733224220.0,AITA_Relationships,3,1.0,False

This includes making me attend a bunch of classes on different stuff like painting, piano and etc. (Story for another time) and also food. My mom would make all kinds of dishes and meals. My dad would go out and buy different meals too. They kinda varied day by day on who would make the food. This is where the problem started.

I was young at the time and was quite obedient. I would listen to my parents and eat and eat. I was still thin at the time maybe like 50kg. Then, I had an accident and injured my arm. My dad was like cheese has calcium and so fed me cheese everyday. I was stupid at the time and I should've said no to the cheese because then I grew to 80kg. Here's where the fun begins.

I got told by parents that I should lose weight since a bunch of neighbors have been saying I've become fat and would do like a gesture where their hands are curled to the side showing that I'm fat. I agreed with them even if their methods are quite cruel so I tried to lose weight. During one of my meals, I took one scoop of rice and some protein. I finished the meal and said ""Alright, I'm done"". They lost it. They kept saying ""No no you should eat more, you're growing up. Here take some more rice and protein."" and dumped more food on my plate. This whole back and forth of me trying to cut down on my eating became more explosive and guilt tripping. 

""Are you starving yourself?"" ""Some people don't have food, so you should eat"" ""Here just finish off the remaining leftovers (I hated this one the most because I heard it everyday)"" ""Just finish this tiny portion (I was full and I had to literally close my eyes trying to swallow more food in, I might as well just have been gagging)""

Then came the losing weight talks...""OP you should lose weight"" ""See it's because of all those sugary drinks (Honestly I did take sodas and stuff but it's like once a month and most of the time I drink coffee or tea)"" ""You should exercise (I tried to but my parents always brought me outside and I came back so full that I couldn't move)""

Eventually, I was 21yo and was a whopping 110kg. My self esteem was on the floor and I hated it so much. I always thought to myself if I just had the chance to get away from my parents. I could improve my health 10 times more. That chance came sooner that I thought.

I had just finished my diploma and was about to start going for my degree. My parents said I should go to another country for my degree and so I did. At first, it was scary being in a country alone but I was getting used to it. I made my own meals. I walked to the bus station and around campus. I had my little treats like chocolates, candies and sodas. It felt very freeing and I never felt bloated from my meals. 

Finally, it was my semester break. I was flying back home and I weighed myself and I had lost 10kg in 3 months. I was so shocked and overjoyed. I didn't even go to the gym at the time, it was just casually walking around places. I think if I did, I would lose even more and get healthier. It showed me something that the problem wasn't me, it was my parents. My self-esteem came back and while, my parents were the same with all those talks. I just tuned them out, hoping to get back there and exercise my ass off till I'm healthy. 

Of course, they'll take credit and say ""See OP, all you needed was a bit of my encouragement"". I'm just gonna be happy knowing that I did it all by myself. 

I think the saddest part of this is when I took my blood test when I came back home, it showed me that my liver was getting bad. My mom told me ""OP see you should have laid off those fatty foods and sugary drinks"". I just kinda sat in silence, thinking I should have been more aggressive and more proactive fighting against her but I don't know...that's all in the past. Right now I just hope, I can get better.",1,1733224115.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False

Growing we used to visit my grandpa every Friday in Uptown. We’d get home from school. Get ready. My dad would get home from work before 4 and we’d leave at 5 

We’d go to the thrift store first if traffic wasn’t too bad, it used to be on Sheridan between Agatite and Sunnyside. I’m not saying they had amazing stuff but every once in a while you’d find something decent. 

My dad would rent a gym out with his home country friends and run basketball games. Margate Park Fieldhouse. We’d be there till 9 pm 

Then we’d go to grandpas and order pizza from Gigios. Watch a movie. Chill. 

Good times. Good times.

That thrift store is gone apparently. I don’t even know for how long, but it’s a dollar store I think. I work around Addison and lakeshore and I was wondering If there’s any other thrift store spots around. I start work at 3 pm

When it comes to vanilla, few varieties are as cherished as [Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar](https://robustmadagascar.com/products/vanilla/). Known for its rich, creamy flavor and intoxicating aroma, this vanilla is the gold standard in culinary and commercial applications. Sourced from the lush landscapes of Madagascar, it is revered by chefs, bakers, and vanilla enthusiasts worldwide. Robust Madagascar is proud to be a part of this heritage, offering the finest Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar to global markets.

**What Makes Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar Special?**

Madagascar, often referred to as the ""Vanilla Island,"" is responsible for over 80% of the world's vanilla production. The country’s unique climate, rich soil, and traditional curing methods contribute to the exceptional quality of Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar. The term ""Bourbon"" does not refer to the liquor but rather to the Bourbon Islands, where this type of vanilla originated.

Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar is known for its deep, creamy flavor profile. The beans are rich in vanillin, the compound responsible for vanilla’s iconic taste and scent. The quality of these beans ensures their widespread use in desserts, beverages, and perfumes.

**The Process Behind Premium Vanilla**

Producing Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar is a labor-intensive process. It begins with hand-pollinating the vanilla orchids, a delicate and time-sensitive task. Once pollinated, the pods take around 9 months to mature. After harvest, the pods undergo a meticulous curing process involving blanching, sweating, drying, and conditioning.

This traditional process, maintained by Madagascar’s skilled farmers, enhances the flavor and aroma, making Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar the most sought-after vanilla in the world. Robust Madagascar collaborates with local farmers to ensure sustainability and quality throughout this process.

**Uses of Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar**

The versatility of Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar is one of its greatest assets. Here are some of its popular applications:

1. **Culinary Masterpieces**: From cakes to ice creams, this vanilla adds a luxurious touch to desserts. Chefs rely on its robust flavor to elevate their creations.
2. **Beverages**: It’s a key ingredient in gourmet coffee syrups, milkshakes, and cocktails, providing a smooth and aromatic finish.
3. **Perfumery**: The sweet, rich scent of Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar makes it a popular choice in high-end fragrances and aromatherapy products.
4. **Health and Wellness**: The antioxidants in vanilla are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, making it a favored ingredient in natural health remedies.

Robust Madagascar offers vanilla products tailored for these uses, ensuring that every customer receives the best quality.

**Sustainability and Ethical Practices**

Robust Madagascar is committed to sustainable and ethical practices in the production of Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar. Vanilla farming in Madagascar supports the livelihoods of thousands of families. By fostering fair trade practices, Robust Madagascar ensures that farmers are fairly compensated for their hard work.

Additionally, the company invests in initiatives to protect Madagascar’s unique biodiversity. By choosing Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar from Robust Madagascar, you are not only enjoying premium quality but also contributing to the preservation of the environment and the welfare of local communities.

**How to Identify Authentic Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar**

As the demand for vanilla rises, so does the risk of counterfeit products. Here’s how you can ensure you’re purchasing genuine [Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar](https://robustmadagascar.com/products/vanilla/):

1. **Source**: Always buy from reputable suppliers like Robust Madagascar.
2. **Appearance**: Authentic pods are long, plump, and slightly oily to the touch.
3. **Aroma**: Genuine Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar has a rich, creamy, and sweet scent that’s unmistakable.

By sourcing directly from Madagascar, Robust Madagascar guarantees the authenticity and freshness of every vanilla product.

**Conclusion**

Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar is more than just an ingredient—it’s a symbol of quality, tradition, and sustainability. Whether you’re a chef creating a masterpiece, a perfumer crafting a signature scent, or a consumer seeking the finest vanilla, this variety is unmatched.

With a commitment to excellence, Robust Madagascar brings the finest Bourbon Vanilla Madagascar to your doorstep. Experience the richness and heritage of this exceptional vanilla by choosing products from a trusted supplier.

I noticed a fledgling in a very high traffic area (in front of shopping centre) and after I finished my food shop it was still there. 
I brought it home but now that I’ve had the chance to do some research I fear that I have made the wrong decision and should have left it there for the parents to find. 
RSPCA have been no help but a local wildlife carer has offered to find a bird expert to organise proper care. 

Chippy (the birb) is snuggled up with its head tucked under its wing in an flowerpot that I have lined with some old towels. The room is quiet, dark and well ventilated. 
Would you guys recommend handing Chippy over to the wildlife carers tomorrow or should I just put it back to where it was? 
The coffee shop it was sitting in front of may be able to keep an eye on him to see if the parents come back. 

Also if anyone knows what kind of bird it is I would be very grateful to know! It’s very small and the beak shape makes me think it’s diet would be small insects. ",2,1733222032.0,AustralianBirds,21,0.56,False

Hey! Long time lurker trying my shot to see whether this is worth a try. I’m not opposed to casual fun, but also interested in lasting conversations. There is no pressure from my side and I hope to find someone i vibe with.

A bit about me: I'm close to 30 (caught me!), 6’1”, love to cook, rock climb, read and occasionally play some video games. I’m also a  huge coffee nerd which seems to be mandatory when getting older lol.

In a more detailed fashion, this is what potentially awaits you:

* Conventionally attractive guy with short blonde hair, rocking a trimmed beard, relatively athletic but not to a point where I would consider my build my biggest asset lol, intelligent and nice with words.
* I like sending selfies, video calls and regular updates on work and life.
You should also be confident enough to send a selfie back if we agree to exchanging them early on!
* I know how life can be complicated and people even more so. So if we do not seem to vibe there will be no hard feelings from my side if you do not want to keep a connection.
