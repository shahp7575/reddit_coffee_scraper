1hk40kl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hk40kl,First Time Out in Feminine Attire in Daylight ‚Äì The Stares Turned Me On Like Never Before,"
So, I did something today that I've been dying to do for a while, and let me tell you, it was amazing. For the first time ever, I went out in public in feminine attire during the day. Until now, I‚Äôve only ventured out at night or in more private settings‚Äîso this was a huge leap for me.

I drove 2.5 hours from San Jose to Guerneville, a little LGBT-friendly gem in Northern California, and wow, the excitement started the minute I hit the road. Navigating through San Francisco traffic, I noticed people staring at me‚Äîmen, women, everyone‚Äîand I‚Äôm not going to lie: it was embarrassing and arousing at the same time. It‚Äôs hard to describe the feeling, but imagine being the center of attention and loving it. Every glance felt like a delicious little rush.

On my way, I stopped for gas, grabbed a coffee, and used the restroom. The lady at the station was super sweet and even gave me a compliment on my outfit‚Äîhonestly, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. I was already feeling more confident, and it just added to the thrill.

Once I got to Guerneville, I parked, touched up my makeup, fixed my hair, and applied some lipstick. I was nervous at first to step out of the car, but I could already feel the excitement building. After a few deep breaths, I finally got out and walked down the Main Street. I felt so feminine, so desired‚Äîand I absolutely loved it. I picked up a couple of lacy panties (because, why not treat myself?) and had a blast taking some photos and videos to remember the moment.

It was a mix of liberating, exciting, and arousing all rolled into one. There‚Äôs something so thrilling about stepping out and feeling like the world is noticing you, maybe even in ways you don‚Äôt expect. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how good it felt to be seen for who I really am.

Anyone else had a similar experience? Any tips on how to keep pushing these boundaries and embracing this side of myself even more? I‚Äôm hungry for more experiences like this and can‚Äôt wait to see where it leads.",1,1734890890.0,Crossdresser_Fashion,0,1.0,False

That made you guys who you were. Even if there were small things. It‚Äôs still really painful. Once they‚Äôre gone you think about them and miss them.

 My girlfriend loves coffee. Especially iced coffee. We went to Dunkin Donuts a lot. Probably too much at times. She would do mobile orders for us. I got so used to going up to the drive-thru and saying mobile order for Christine. That sticks with me now when I go to Dunkin. I love the drink and food I may be getting there but I also feel sad. 

She became comfortable farting in front of me. I know that‚Äôs a big thing for women. Some couples have been together for years and they don‚Äôt fart each other. She did it once in my car by accident and got embarrassed. I laughed. It was funny and cute. It didn‚Äôt bother me or annoy me at all. It never did when she did. I would ask if she had to fart because I would love when she did. It was a thing we had. I‚Äôve never been a guy bothered by a woman farting. 

She also let me sit on her lap a few times when she was on the toilet. I know that may sound weird. It was like a sexy and kinky thing we did. I would kiss her. That‚Äôs obviously a very vulnerable place for anyone. But we didn‚Äôt make each other feel weird. I‚Äôve never done that with any other woman ever. I‚Äôve never felt that comfortable with another woman like that. We were going the bathroom in front of each other and it became normal. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd lose that. 

We also started writing sexy stories for each other. Something I‚Äôve never done with another girl. Stories with us in them in various situations doing different things. I love writing, so I loved doing it. A lot of fantasy went into it. She loved what I wrote. And what she would write was really hot. I don‚Äôt know how many women will do this and enjoy writing. That‚Äôs not something easy to find.

Her and I had so many inside jokes that we would always laugh about. We had nicknames for each other. Even sweetheart has stuck with me. Other girls I‚Äôve been with haven‚Äôt called me that. Her and I would call each other that. It meant a lot to me.

1hk3ws0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1hk3ws0/raycon_everyday_earbuds_review_my_honest_take/,Raycon Everyday Earbuds Review ‚Äì My Honest Take,"Hey everyone! After testing out the Raycon Everyday Earbuds (2024 Edition) for a few weeks, I've got some thoughts to share. These little guys boast 32 hours of playtime, multipoint technology, extreme comfort, and active noise cancellation. Here's how they fared in the real world.

The sound quality. Honestly, I was impressed. The bass is pretty punchy, which is great if you're into bass-heavy genres like hip-hop or EDM. My buddy, who's a total audiophile, gave them a nod of approval, which says a lot. The mids and highs are clear, though maybe not the best for classical music lovers. But hey, for the price, they're doing a solid job.

Onto comfort. These earbuds are super lightweight, and the fit is snug without being intrusive. I wore them during a couple of jogs around the neighborhood, and they stayed put ‚Äì no awkward adjustments mid-run. My cousin borrowed them for a long bus ride and said they didn‚Äôt irritate his ears, even after hours of use.

When it comes to active noise cancellation, they're decent. They won't turn a crowded cafe into a silent library, but they do a good job at reducing background chatter. It's great for when I just need to focus on work or zone out with my playlist. My coworker, who loves working in coffee shops, found them pretty effective.

The battery life is another strong point. With 32 hours of playtime, I wasn't constantly hunting for a charger. A full charge got me through a week of moderate use. The charging case is sleek and fits in my pocket without feeling bulky. My sister, who's a frequent flyer, thought they were perfect for long flights without needing a recharge.

Multipoint technology is a nice touch, allowing me to connect to my phone and laptop simultaneously. Switching between devices was smooth, which was handy when I needed to jump between calls and tunes.

Now, let's talk about where these earbuds might fall shor**t.** Call quality could be better. In noisy environments, the person on the other end sometimes had trouble hearing me. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to consider if you take a lot of calls on the go.

Also, the touch controls take a bit of getting used to. I found myself accidentally skipping tracks or pausing music more often than I'd like. A bit of practice helps, but it's a small hiccup in the user experience.

Comparing to competitors like the AirPods Pro or the Jabra Elite 75t, the earbuds hold their own, especially when you consider the price point. They might not have the same brand prestige or premium features, but they deliver solid performance for everyday users.

In terms of value for money, they're worth it if you‚Äôre looking for reliable earbuds without splurging on high-end brands. The energy efficiency is a plus too, especially if you're mindful of how often you're charging your gear.

The Raycon Everyday Earbuds offer a great mix of features, comfort, and affordability. They‚Äôre not perfect, but they‚Äôre a solid choice for most casual listeners.

I've been working at my current shop for a year as a barista.  I've become great friends with my co-workers and manager.  My manager still has to be ""the boss"" but I would absolutely consider her to be a friend.  I show up to work on time, work full time, get on with the regulars and crank out consistently good drinks.  From what I can tell....I'm well liked amongst my co-workers and have the job down.

Our shop recently opened a second location that is doing very very very well.  Twice (may more) the business as the original location.  It's an exciting time to be working with some homies and has opened up the possibility for more work and a potential promotion.  I've expressed interest for taking on more responsibilities in the past.  It didn't seem viable at the time given the semi-lackluster sales at the original location.

The GM at the original location has taken on more of a district manager role.  She is spread very thin between both shops trying to keep an eye on everything and get things locked in at the new location.  She seems like she could definitely use a hand with the day to day (keeping track of inventory, online orders etc)....just the smaller tasks that have fallen by the wayside with everything going on.

I'm coming up on one year at the shop and I believe myself to be a good fit and a reliable worker.  I once again asked about some additional responsibilities.  I was given the green light and have a date scheduled in two months to have a serious sit down interview.

I work and see the day to day nuances that my manager misses simply because she isn't on the floor much.  I have a lot of experience promoting community events and have a rough idea of what works.  I have a few low cost ($100-$200) ideas that I truly believe could help get people through the doors.

If you were in this position as a manager, how would you feel about this?  Are managers open to hearing ideas about boosting sales, cutting costs and getting people into the shop?  I want to be respectful and stay in my own lane.  

Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.  I'd love some advice on ways to bounce these ideas off my manager in a collaborative and respectful way.  Hopefully, making a great case for a promotion to supervisor along the way.",1,1734890281.0,barista,0,1.0,False

Those mistakes only affected me. Those mistakes are normal things that every person go through to become better. People are not perfect.

For example, they bring back some silly mistakes like spilling coffee and brand me as clumsy and careless but avoid acknowledging my strengths like being bold enough to do things that others didn't, being careful enough to avoid pitfalls in certain things.

I can't fathom how can someone be jealous of their own offspring? They literally don't want me to be proud of myself. All the successes I did/have must be credited to them and if I don't, then their narcissism comes up. If I have traits that are literally brand new to them like having a really nice music taste,fashion that people appreciated me, then they are jealous and mock me and try to make me not have any pride over it.

Their criticisms and their constant negative view of myself is now literally my inner monologue.

I realise that people with high self esteem - their brains naturally focus on their positives. But narcs gave me low self esteem and I always focus on my negatives - my failures etc.

I have to literally rewire my neural pathways. The thoughts are so automatic. I always thought the way to overcome my low self esteem is to do more and more. Achieve more and more. But it's an endless journey. I feel like simply highlighting our positive traits and using it to define ourself while acknowledging and giving grace to our mistakes and accepting that we are imperfect human beings at the end goes a long way.",2,1734890135.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1hk3kkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1hk3kkw/partner_continually_pushed_boundaries_i_think_im/,Partner continually pushed boundaries - I think I‚Äôm done.,"
My wife and I (45F and 45NB, goes by she/they) have been together for nearly ten years. We started out in an open relationship, ENM and swinging. We have three kids from her first marriage. Their father is out of the picture due to substance and verbal abuse. There is a RO in place until end next year. 

I never considered us as polyamorous. We dated people as friends with benefits. We used to date together but I said I didn‚Äôt like it and I felt like it was couples privilege. Our partners were more like deep friendships with physicality and I was not looking to change that dynamic in the relationship. 

As the years have gone by, I have found my partner to continually push against my boundaries. She has now discovered she is polyamorous and fell in love with a woman who lives in Europe while I was recovering from ankle surgery. She then had the gf visit her right after she told me she was in love. They had three overnights and several dates while she was here for a week in May. In September, she went to Europe, where the gf loves. The gf returned for Thanksgiving and is back again for the remainder of December. My partner had sex with her in her office while she was here on Thanksgiving. She then planned two more overnight with her for December - at least that‚Äôs what we agreed upon. 

I just saw on the calendar last night that she planned another overnight with her, from Friday night through Sunday evening. 

These overnights have become entire weekends. During the kids‚Äô holiday breaks. I am disabled and essentially on my own. We also struggle with finances bc of my trying to get back to work I can physically do. So she‚Äôs spending money on hotels and restaurants and activities on this person, yet she‚Äôs always stressed bc we‚Äôre late on utilities and basic needs. 

I have felt like my boundaries are repeatedly pushed upon and I think I have reached the end of this. We have been in couples therapy for two years and it‚Äôs the main topic of conversation. Me trying to adapt to her having a regular serious gf who she chooses to see for multiple days anytime she‚Äôs here. I had a very hard time with her spending hundreds of dollars on a trip to Europe and then her coming home and literally crying about how broke we are. 

It‚Äôs been downhill all year. At the beginning of this year, we were on a date and she asked me if we should ask out our server. I said I didn‚Äôt want to. When we left the restaurant she told me she did anyway and then said she doesn‚Äôt remember asking me about it at all. I said I felt disrespected that she would approach someone while we were on a date. They said the check came and they waited to ask the server out when she tipped her. They then included me on a text with this person. I was so hurt by this and other things over the years, I told them I needed time apart for a couple of days to make some decisions. 

Well the very next day as I was doing laundry, I had a seizure and fell down the stairs. I broke my ankle and needed surgery. 
I quite literally felt trapped. 

When she met the gf, her NRE was extremely high. She took calls in front of me. She texted her on dates with me, while she is sitting next to me, or in bed next to me. She once sent her a text of the restaurant we were at while on our date.
One time she did shrooms in the backyard and had phone sex with her. Other times I woke up to find her sexting in bed, with pictures/video, or heard her in the bathroom (in our room) having phone sex. Now on this last visit, she‚Äôs chosen to have sex with the gf in the office I also work in when she needs admin help. She‚Äôs self employed as a sex therapist. Funny right. 

I have been struggling to find work as I‚Äôve been disabled bc of seizures and have lost financial independence. Anytime I say that I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs okay for these trips to take all of her attention when the kids are on break, I get back that she doesn‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. Then she tells me she loves me a billion times and brings home gifts that I feel are meant to placate me. She says we have dates, too. I said coffee once or twice a week after we drop the kids off at school does not amount to European vacations and hotel stays in the city. 

I was ready to leave after the server incident, bc they don‚Äôt understand why I felt hurt. They continue to say to me they‚Äôre sad that their new relationship structure makes me sad. I said it‚Äôs the way she conducts her dating life, as if my wife has no family when this gf comes up. I also don‚Äôt feel free to have my own relationships tended to bc she‚Äôs gone. Who will watch the kids if we‚Äôre both gone. 

In therapy when I‚Äôve brought it up, the last therapist we had kept drumming into me that I agreed to this. I did not. I agreed to a certain relationship structure. If this is what my wife believes works for her as an individual, then she is of course free to do what she wants with her life, but I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with someone who disrespects my boundaries and takes advantage of my being ‚Äúavailable‚Äù to have multiple vacations and spend money we don‚Äôt have on someone else. Between this relationship and the two others she has, she‚Äôs spending just about every weekend with other people, spending money and then turning around and crying about finances.

I lost my patience and temper this morning, and called her bc our daughter texted to ask when she would be home and she never responded. I also said for this upcoming weekend I don‚Äôt agree to her being gone the whole weekend being with the gf. I want to make my own plans and she assumed I would just be here.

I have said I think we need to separate and she keeps saying she wants to make it work. I now feel physically distant as well as more and more emotionally distant and don‚Äôt feel very invested. When she tries to cuddle me, I feel like I‚Äôm letting myself down if I let her touch me. I am starting to lose respect in myself bc I am allowing this to happen or at least I keep staying while she keeps doing things that I find hurtful. 

I plan to say in our next therapy session that I want to separate. After more than a year of this, I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôm afraid that without our therapist I won‚Äôt be able to stick to it. 

I don‚Äôt have a place to stay unfortunately- none of my friends have room, my family is gone (both of my parents died in the last five years) and I‚Äôm still looking for work. I don‚Äôt know how I am going to do this but I can‚Äôt stay in a romantic relationship with her. Nor, as she offered, do I want to stay and not be together romantically to keep the family together or separate and still date. As in if/when I leave, she thinks we can de-escalate since ‚Äújust bc marriage didn‚Äôt work out, it doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt love each other‚Äù.

Frankly, I find my love dwindling. I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt enthusiastically consent to this so many times and yet she continues on without addressing what‚Äôs wrong with our marriage. She also likes to highlight our marriage in her relationships with other people, as though I consent to all of this. Then she passes on how chill they think I am, which is insulting bc she‚Äôs either delusional or lying to these partners. 

I‚Äôm so angry and sad at this writing, I‚Äôm having trouble collecting my words in a coherent way. Anytime I bring up separation I feel like I end up apologizing and don‚Äôt know up from down. 

Could this community maybe help me with words to express myself succinctly? This time of year is already rough on me- my mom‚Äôs favorite holiday, my dad was very religious, and my mom passed on December 30 five years ago. I know my emotions are heightened bc of this but I also just feel like I‚Äôve had enough and haven‚Äôt stood up for myself enough.

1hk3k1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hk3k1q/how_do_i_57f_process_learning_that_my_boyfriend/,How do I (57F) process learning that my boyfriend (63M) hired women to have sex with him?,"We both are legally separated (4 and 3 years respectively) following long marriages. We have been dating for a year and were at the point of serious conversations about a forever future together. He loves and is in love with me. I feel the same. He's the kind of standup guy (stable emotionally and financially, fiercely dedicated father, responsible, adoring of me, always respectful, morally driven) with whom your mother always wanted you to settle. 

While we had established our relationship on a mutual commitment to complete honesty and transparency, he hid from me the fact that he hired women to have sex with him through sugar baby/sugar daddy arrangements in the past. There were four such women.  

I learned only because his ex is threatening to expose him in order to get what she wants out of the divorce decree. He wanted me to know this before it came out some other way. 

The situation was thus. He was faithful to a 20 year marriage (I do believe him on this). He stayed with her through a decade of sexual/emotional withdrawal and after discovering she had romantic/emotional affairs with multiple men. He did three years of couples therapy after this discovery, and then two years further of waiting to see if she would return to the marriage.

She did not. She finally told him there would be no such future. She asked him to support her move to Southern California. At this time, she told him ""I don't care anymore. What you do as long as you don't bring it home "". They agreed to separate after their youngest graduated high school and two more years.

It was at this time he went went onto seekingarrangement.com. 

His rationale ‚Äì he had been celibate through most of his 50s because of his wife's complete withdrawal. He was starved for touch and physical intimacy. He knew that he could not emotionally handle any type of real relationship during the time that he was still (part time) under the same roof as his Ex and children. He knew he could not give a woman the time, prioritization and emotional intimacy that that requires. So, he saw this is the only option for the 'intimacy' he craved.   Perhaps the hook up culture (Tinder) so familiar to us all now felt less obvious or accessible to him at the time?

I am struggling with this new knowledge on so many levels. This behavior is discordant with the man I thought him to be. Purchasing access to sex in exchange for money goes against my core values against the objectification of women. But perhaps it is most this idea of purchasing a 'faux intimacy'. These women sat across from him during elegant meals, laughing at his jokes and engaging in sparkling conversation, they looked at him in a way that signaled they wanted HIM for dessert. They would go for coffee in the morning. They were expert at making a man feel witty, fascinating and most of all DESIRED. They crafted the illusion that sex was mutually desired, HOT and their pleasure always genuine. He paid for this delusion. 

Sex workers do no such thing. The transaction is raw, real and straightforward. It IS just about sex. 

There's something about this need for fake intimacy that is making me the most turned off. I can't stop thinking about this past. I feel numb where I used to feel incredible attraction and passion for this man.

For quite a long time now the adults in our family don‚Äôt generally buy presents for each other unless it‚Äôs a milestone birthday or some other special occasion (birth, engagement, wedding, etc). We have family members all along the income/wealth spectrum as well as in different geographic locations, and this approach works well. 

I was 50 earlier this year and only got one present from within the family - from my husband. Both my parents and my husband‚Äôs parents are no longer with us. No one else thought to get me one and I‚Äôm really upset about it. In particular, I‚Äôm annoyed at my SIL & BIL (husband‚Äôs sister and her husband) for not getting me anything as they got my husband something for his 50th and we paid for them to come on holiday with us for their 50th birthdays (which fall within a few weeks of each other). It‚Äôs not about the ¬£¬£ - I wouldn‚Äôt have cared if it‚Äôd been a ¬£20 voucher or a pair of cinema tickets - but I just find it disrespectful to get me nothing at all and I‚Äôm genuinely pretty hurt by it. 

For background info, there hasn‚Äôt been any falling out or anything else that I can put my finger on. In fact, we live a few hours away from each other and are all working, so we only see each other 3/4 times a year. When we meet up it‚Äôs therefore fairly pleasant. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve now had a falling out with my husband over this as he thinks I should just suck it up. He agrees that it‚Äôs odd and can see to an extent why I‚Äôm annoyed, but he thinks I‚Äôm overreacting. Maybe I am. Anyway, we visited them today and this brought the whole thing back to mind. It was a normal visit with coffee & cake and polite chat, but I just can‚Äôt seem to let this go. I also want my husband to ask if there‚Äôs any particular reason they didn‚Äôt get me a gift - they didn‚Äôt forget as they sent a card. But he just won‚Äôt broach the subject with them. 

So I‚Äôve said that he can go on his own next time we‚Äôre invited over and that I‚Äôm not feeling like having them over here. So AITAH? Should I just put this down to a first world problem and be grateful for what I‚Äôve got?",3,1734888707.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

A piece of ourselves that broke away inside us. It rattles around, it whispers, it connects itself to a web of our past. You want to know it. You say hi, you search for the word, you search for the someone you once stood beside. In a light, a feeling, in a wish, in a second, it fades, but you know it is there.

A lump in your throat as a life past plays on loop as you try to move on. How can you keep fighting? You have gone too far and each piece of your world is farther than it once was. You reach for it. The hope, the person, the laugh, the kiss ‚Äì the rubber band stretches, recoils, becomes looser on your wrist.¬†

We slammed the lid down and held it until we were weak and it never stopped being so strong. How could we ever know its strength is infinite, constant and we are so fragile? The cut is made, the door is shut, a person fades away into a blackness of rage, misery and terror. What is broken within us that led us here?

A rock, a coffee, a window, a porch, a fleece, an uber, a train, a hospital. Goodbye to the only life I knew. A severed fiber, a torn page ‚Äì a piece of you destroyed and a tear on another‚Äôs cheek as they watch you walk from their story for the last time. There is no more for you here. You are a stranger, a ghost, a picture, a memory. You now exist elsewhere and you cannot understand which way that is. It is not up or down, east or west, north or south. Years of a thread between yourself and this person fray until it falls away and you don‚Äôt yet know it but this part of your heart has fallen behind and it now belongs to where it all fell apart.

It exists for another world, another lifetime, another story. Collisions are recorded in the fabric of time and something files it away as the end of a chapter that was finished before it started. The sunset over the dock, the sound of waves through a hotel window, a pleading cry for forgiveness. It is so powerful that it has aged the core of your soul and all else is of a lesser world. Your existence depends on your strength and the rings around the deepest part of you multiply as the sadness fills you.

This moment is wrong, this moment is wrong, this moment is all you ever had. Endless tides of the world lap at your feet and the water rises. How do others do it? Can they not feel it rising? How are you so lost? How is this your path?¬†

It all becomes a series of fleeting distractions that can only be a temporary respite. This is all not for you. You lost the key, you forgot the combination, you turned the other corner. You must collect the pieces of the world that can make you whole again and know that in the setting of the sun there is always hope.

According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is vital for life, yet many people struggle to understand how much water they should drink daily. Individual hydration needs can vary significantly based on numerous factors. Understanding these needs can lead to improved overall health.

### Why Hydration Matters

Staying hydrated is essential for keeping your body functioning correctly. Water plays a critical role in various bodily functions:

- **Regulating Body Temperature:** Adequate hydration helps maintain your body's temperature, whether through sweating or adjusting your metabolic rate.
- **Supporting Joint Health:** Water acts as a lubricant for joints and cushions your organs, making movement easier and less painful.
- **Aiding Digestion:** Drinking enough water ensures your digestive system runs smoothly, preventing constipation and other gastrointestinal issues.
- **Enhancing Nutrient Absorption:** Hydration facilitates the effective transportation and absorption of essential nutrients in the body.
- **Boosting Energy Levels:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue; staying hydrated helps maintain energy and stamina throughout the day.

### Factors Affecting Your Hydration Needs

While the general guideline suggests drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, your personal needs can differ based on several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### 1. Activity Level

If you are physically active, you will need to drink more water to compensate for fluid loss through sweat. Athletes or those who exercise regularly should aim to hydrate before, during, and after workouts.

#### 2. Climate

Living in hot or humid climates increases your fluid loss, requiring a higher water intake. Cold weather can also dehydrate your body as indoor heating reduces moisture in the air.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### 3. Age and Gender

Generally, women need around 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages per day, while men require about 3 liters (around 13 cups). Older adults may need to pay closer attention to hydration as the body's thirst mechanism can diminish with age.

#### 4. Health Status

Certain health conditions, such as fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, increase your body's need for water. Likewise, certain medications can affect hydration levels, so consult your doctor if unsure.

### Signs You‚Äôre Dehydrated

Knowing how much water you should drink begins with recognizing the symptoms of dehydration:

- **Thirst:** The simplest indicator is thirst itself. If you‚Äôre thirsty, start drinking.
- **Dark Urine:** Pale yellow urine typically indicates good hydration, while dark urine can be a sign of dehydration.
- **Dry Skin:** If your skin feels dry or doesn‚Äôt bounce back when pinched, you may need more water.
- **Fatigue:** Tiredness and low energy can signal a lack of hydration.

### Tips to Stay Hydrated

Adopting simple strategies can help you meet your daily water intake:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle handy to remind yourself to drink more fluids.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Adding fruits or herbs can make water more enjoyable to drink.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or watch to prompt you to drink water throughout the day.
- **Eat Hydrating Foods:** fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumbers, and oranges can contribute to your daily water intake.

How much water should you drink? Listen to your body, and pay attention to these hydration indicators. By understanding your individual hydration needs, you can promote a healthier lifestyle and support your overall well-being. Water is not just a beverage; it‚Äôs a crucial element of health. Stay mindful, drink plenty, and thrive.

The Link Between Hydration and Physical Performance
---------------------------------------------------

Hydration plays a crucial role in your overall physical performance, impacting everything from endurance to strength. When you engage in physical activities, your body loses water through sweat and breathing. Failing to replace that lost fluid can lead to dehydration, which negatively affects your ability to perform effectively. Let‚Äôs explore the link between hydration and physical performance in a detailed manner.

### Understanding Hydration

You might wonder, how much water should you drink to stay properly hydrated? While recommendations can vary, a general guideline is to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, commonly referred to as the ‚Äú8x8 rule.‚Äù However, the amount may differ based on your activity level, age, and overall health. In more active individuals, additional fluids might be necessary, especially during intense workouts or hot weather.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Impact of Hydration on Performance

Hydration significantly influences various physical performance aspects, including:

- **Endurance:** Staying hydrated keeps your muscles and cardiovascular system functioning optimally, enabling you to perform activities for longer without feeling fatigued.
- **Strength:** Adequate water intake ensures that muscles work efficiently. Even mild dehydration can hinder muscle strength and power output.
- **Temperature Regulation:** When you exercise, your body heats up. Water helps regulate your body temperature through sweat, keeping you cool during physical activities.
- **Cognitive Function:** Hydrophobia can affect not only your body but also your mind. Staying hydrated supports focus, decision-making, and reaction time, which are crucial for peak performance.

### Signs of Dehydration

Recognizing the signs of dehydration is key to maintaining your performance. Common indicators include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Thirst
- Dark yellow urine
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Dry mouth and skin
- Fatigue and weakness

If you experience any of these symptoms, it may be time to drink more fluids. Always be proactive in your hydration to avoid these signs before they become severe.

### Optimal Drinking Strategies

To enhance your performance, consider these drinking strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Pre-Exercise:** Drink water regularly throughout the day. Aim to consume at least 16-20 ounces 2-3 hours before your workout.
- **During Exercise:** Take small sips every 15-20 minutes during your workout‚Äîeven if you don't feel thirsty. Aim for at least 7-10 ounces for every 10-20 minutes of exercise.
- **Post-Exercise:** Replenish lost fluids by drinking water or a sports drink. Aim for 16-24 ounces for every pound lost during your workout.

### The Role of Electrolytes

Hydration isn't just about water; electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium also play a significant role. When you sweat, you lose these essential minerals. Replenishing them through sports drinks or electrolyte-enriched waters can maintain your performance and prevent cramping during intense activities.

### Hydration and Recovery

After exercise, your body needs water to recover. Proper hydration aids muscle repair, reduces soreness, and restores energy levels. Drinking enough fluids in the post-exercise phase can significantly shorten recovery time, allowing you to return to your physical activities sooner.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Hydration Recommendations

To optimize your hydration for physical performance, consider the following tips:

- Integrate hydration into your daily routine.
- Use a water bottle to keep track of your intake.
- Pay attention to your body‚Äôs signals.
- Opt for hydrating foods like fruits and vegetables.
- Adjust your fluid intake based on exercise intensity and environmental conditions.

By understanding the connection between hydration and physical performance, you empower yourself to maximize your potential. Remember, consistent hydration practices will lead to improved endurance, faster recovery, and ultimately a healthier, more active lifestyle. Your body will thank you when you make hydration a priority.

How Water Intake Affects Skin Health and Appearance
---------------------------------------------------

Water is a vital component of our overall health, impacting various bodily functions, including skin health and appearance. It is not merely a refreshing beverage but a critical ingredient that can lead to a radiant, youthful glow or cause dryness and aging when neglected. Understanding how water intake affects your skin can motivate you to stay properly hydrated.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Hydration and Skin Elasticity

Drinking an adequate amount of water daily plays a crucial role in maintaining skin elasticity. When your skin is well-hydrated, it remains supple and can stretch without losing its firmness. Conversely, insufficient water intake can lead to dry, flaky skin that is more prone to fine lines and wrinkles. This reinforces the need to regularly replenish your body's water supply.

### Flush Toxins

Water helps in flushing toxins from your body. When you drink enough water, your kidneys function optimally and filter waste more efficiently. This detoxification process is essential for preventing skin issues such as acne, eczema, and dermatitis. Additionally, a clear complexion is often a sign of good hydration, as your skin can expel harmful toxins effectively.

### Enhances Blood Circulation

Proper hydration boosts blood circulation, which is essential for delivering nutrients and oxygen to skin cells. Improved circulation means that your skin receives more of the essential compounds it needs to stay healthy and vibrant. When your blood flow increases, so does your skin's ability to repair itself, leading to a more youthful appearance.

### Prevents Dryness

Hydrated skin prevents dryness and maintains a natural glow. Water acts as a natural moisturizer, keeping skin cells hydrated from within. When your body receives enough water, it can better regulate moisture levels in the skin, reducing the chances of dryness and flaky patches. For individuals living in dry climates or experiencing winter cold, increasing water intake can be especially beneficial.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Importance in Healing

Water intake is crucial for skin repair and healing. If you have a cut, burn, or any skin affliction, hydration can speed up recovery. Water supports the formation of new cells and helps to keep the skin barrier intact, protecting against external irritants. A well-hydrated body can respond better to skin treatments and enhance the effectiveness of topical applications.

### Collagen Production

Collagen is a protein that maintains the skin's structure and elasticity. Adequate water intake fosters collagen production, helping to keep your skin firm and plump. Dehydrated skin often appears saggy and lifeless, emphasizing the lines and wrinkles that speak of aging. By prioritizing hydration, you can support your skin's collagen levels for a more youthful look.

### Natural Skin Glow

Drinking enough water contributes to a natural, healthy glow. Hydration helps to plump up skin cells, making your skin look radiant and fresh. You may notice that your skin appears dull when you are dehydrated. By focusing on your water consumption, you can achieve a vibrant appearance while mitigating signs of fatigue.

### Eliminates Dark Circles

Dark circles under your eyes can often be a sign of dehydration. By ensuring that you drink enough water, you can help reduce the appearance of these shadows and puffiness. Hydration supports overall skin health, making your eyes look brighter and more awake. Adding more water to your daily routine may give you that needed boost to look more refreshed.

### Effects of Caffeine and Alcohol

It's important to note that caffeinated beverages and alcohol can lead to dehydration. While they might momentarily boost energy or relaxation, they can take a toll on your skin over time. You should balance your intake of these substances with plenty of water to counter any adverse effects and keep your skin looking its best. Stay mindful of your consumption habits and hydrate accordingly.

### Water-Rich Foods

If plain water isn't your favorite, consider incorporating water-rich foods into your diet. Foods like cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges not only provide hydration but are also packed with nutrients beneficial for your skin. By choosing a combination of hydration sources, you‚Äôll enhance your skin‚Äôs appearance further.

The connection between water intake and skin health is undeniable. From enhancing elasticity to promoting a natural glow, staying hydrated is a simple yet effective way to care for your skin. Make a habit of drinking enough water daily, and you will likely see a positive change in your skin's appearance and overall health. Remember, your skin deserves the best!

Hydration's Role in Mental Clarity and Focus
--------------------------------------------

Your brain needs water just as much as your body does. Staying hydrated is fundamental, and its role in maintaining mental clarity and focus cannot be overstated. Let‚Äôs explore how hydration affects your mind and why you should pay careful attention to your water intake.

When you think about hydration, you might envision physical endeavors, like exercising or spending time in the sun. However, hydration also plays a pivotal role in cognitive functions. Water is essential for numerous bodily processes, and your brain is one of the most affected organs. Along with providing structural support, adequate hydration boosts brain function significantly.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### How Water Impacts Mental Clarity

Your brain is around 75% water. This high water content is crucial for its operation. If you‚Äôre even slightly dehydrated, it affects your ability to concentrate and think clearly.

1. **Improved Decision-Making:** When you‚Äôre well-hydrated, your brain can process information more effectively, helping you make quicker and better decisions.
2. **Enhanced Memory:** Studies suggest that dehydration can negatively impact short-term memory. Drinking enough water can help you retain information better.
3. **Sharper Focus:** A well-hydrated mind can maintain attention and focus longer, enhancing productivity in tasks that require concentration.
4. **Better Mood:** Dehydration is linked to irritability and mood swings. Staying hydrated keeps you feeling balanced and positive.

### How Dehydration Affects Cognitive Functions

As beneficial as water is, lack of it can lead to numerous problems. Dehydration can impact your cognitive abilities in various ways:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Fatigue:** Lack of water leads to fatigue. A tired brain struggles to focus, making it hard to complete tasks efficiently.
- **Slower Reaction Times:** If you're not drinking enough water, you might notice slower reaction times, which can be dangerous, especially in tasks that require quick thinking.
- **Difficulty in Problem Solving:** Dehydration can hinder your ability to solve problems effectively, disrupting your thought process.
- **Increased Stress Levels:** Hydration plays a role in regulating cortisol, a stress hormone. Low hydration can lead to higher stress levels, further affecting cognitive functions.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

If you want to maintain your mental clarity and focus, make hydration a priority. Here are some practical tips to ensure you‚Äôre drinking enough water daily:

1. **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or an app to remind you to drink water throughout the day.
2. **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a reusable bottle with you can make it easier to sip water regularly.
3. **Infuse Your Water:** If plain water doesn‚Äôt excite you, try adding fruits or herbs to it for flavor.
4. **Track Your Intake:** Keep a daily log or use apps to track how much water you consume.
5. **Start Early:** Make it a habit to drink a glass of water when you wake up.

It's essential to listen to your body and note the signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, dizziness, or fatigue. Being proactive about your hydration can have a substantial impact on your mental state.

Hydration is not merely a physical need; it‚Äôs crucial for our cognitive health as well. The relationship between hydration and mental clarity highlights the importance of maintaining adequate water levels for optimal brain function. By prioritizing your water intake, you can enhance your focus, improve your memory, and maintain overall cognitive performance.

So next time you reach for a drink, remember that the simple act of staying hydrated can pave the way for sharper thinking and better performance in whatever you do!

### Use Technology to Your Advantage

\[Whispering\]

""Mom?  Mom?  Oh . . . are you already awake?  Have I told you today how much I love you, I really do, you know, I mean, so long as you're up . . .""

\[I get up, throw something on over my pajamas, put on my head lamp, put on his e-collar, and he goes for a run in our woods.

6:00 am - we've had breakfast, I've read various news sources, and I close my laptop

\[Stretching casually\]

""Oh, hey, did you just close your laptop, Mom?  You know, I really liked breakfast and you're the best Mom evah! and maybe I gotta go do Number 2 'cause we had breakfast, Mom, and I really, really, REALLY love you . . .""

\[See 4:00 am activity above.  Post-walk I go into shower and since my husband is up, Bronx stretches out on our bed, sounds of snoring ensue.  I grab a second cup of coffee, head upstairs to my office, start work\]

8:30-ish - looks out of the window in my office.

""Mom, the sun is up.  You know, we probably need to make another pass through our woods, 'cause it was dark when we did it earlier, and I might have missed maybe a bear or a wolf - or zombies! - and so don't you think just to be safe we do another patrol, because I want you and Daddy to be safe, and Trudy the Cat, too, 'cause sometimes bears or lions may be out there . . .""

\[We go for another run in our woods\]

Noon - I stand up for lunch.

""Mom, I listened on the radio that a short walk helps with digestion, and that rabbit I chased earlier may be out there, and I bet he's gonna come eat Dad's garden, sure, it's winter, but I bet he's thinking about it and I better go out and chase him som more just to let him know I mean business, plus I need to refresh my markings on the property to keep the lions and wolves away, including that stupid doodle who walks by on the road in the back of our property, I think he's up to no good . . .""

\[A shorter walk but one nonetheless.  We get back, I have lunch, he passes out on the couch\]

3:00 pm - suddenly appears at the side of my desk

""Mom, I bet you could use a stretch, I still have napping to finish but I really, really love you and I am willing to take a little walk with you, for YOUR sake, Mom, 'cause did I say I love you so much, just a little stroll . . .""

{We go for another run in our woods\]

6:00 pm - I come downstairs to grab dinner

""Mom, you done for the day?  Dad's got the news on, he's done, too, you know, before it gets dark maybe we should go see if that doodle is nowhere to be found and those chipmunks might be conniving with the wolves to attack us, so what say you and I do one more patrol, you know, just to be safe . . .""

\[We go for another run in our woods.  At this point, let me state that I'm walking and Bronx is running, when he's not digging under a log to try to grab a squirrel or chipmunk who don;t play fairly when they burrow or climb trees to escape him, Bronx just wants to play, okay, the game is ""let me shake you 'til you're dead"" but nevertheless . . .\]

\[Most night, TV is watched.  I sit back in a recliner so as to make a large enough lap for you-know-who to curl up in it, satisfied that he must be a puppy still because he still fits, all 90 pounds of him.  I usually head upstairs to bed to read while my husband watches one more show\]

9:00 pm - Dad clicks off the TV

""Dad!  Dad!  Did you shut the TV off, I heard you shut the TV off, you know, I bet the wolves and lions and bears are outside so you and me, Dad, we better take a walk in the woods to make sure everyone can sleep safe tonight, Dad . . .""

\[Husband walks Bronx.  They come upstairs and Bronx settles into his crate, content that he has once again protected the household and the enemies of the state, including the doodle, have been kept at bay by his sheer presence and regular markings around the property\]

1hk2yji,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hk2yji,Had an amazing shot of Nicaragua Acopio Suyatal! ,"Roasted last night, I made my roomate and myself a shot of this amazing coffee. After trying out a 1:2 ratio for the first time a week ago, the flavors in my shots have really opened up! 
A couple days ago I just got my DF64 gen 2 with SSP Silver Knight v2 coated burrs. And so far it has surpassed my expectations even though I've heard it will take a while for it to open up to properly season the burrs. I'm coming from a 1Zpresso J-Max. I really got the DF64 to be able to quickly grind coffee for tasting at least once a week. It is quite a time hog to purge, grind coffee 1, purge, grind coffee 2 on a hand grinder. 
I've had the Flair Pro 2 for a while and recently got a shot mirror along with a second porta filter with shower screen so I can easily make a second shot without too much fuss. After seeing everyone love the Flair 58 along with a friend of mine, I got real grass is greener on the other side vibes. Lance then came out with his video on a better ratio of puck depth vs width and how it makes for a more repeatable shot along with possibly better extraction. With this I'm now quite set on sticking with the Pro 2.
I had the Acaia scale for about a year but stopped using it until last night when I found the size works better than my other scale. I don't really like the tiny touch targets on the Acaia making it hard to reliably control. Normally I use a white label rechargeable coffee scale I got for about $10 and even though it's big, it's about as accurate and fast as the Acaia which I love to tell people for a lower cost of entry for coffee scales. 
For the kettle, I just use a boil kettle, I just need it to boil anyways since I'm always using light(~15%) roasts.

A small upgrade I've been thinking about is a mesh screen instead of a shower screen for the Pro 2. I haven't looked to see if it exists yet but that's the only slight upgrade I could imagine unless there are other ideas out there.

Now, to be more clear ‚Äîand because now I know what it was‚Äî, it was aesthetic attraction, sensual attraction and alterous attraction. I aparted myself from him for 5-6 months.
Now, a few days ago, he texted me back ‚Äîweeks ago I had asked him which Pokemon was his favorite and replied with Chandelure, was a big progress lol‚Äî and after that he asked me if my parents let me come over to his house to receibe someone (I guess it was the birthday of someone (?) and I said that they didn't let me and we texted for a while. The next day after that it was his birthday and I texted him with a 'happy birthday', he replied and I sent him a long message and the link of a project he liked a lot and we spoke about it a lot months before the incident of my feelings. He did remember it and I think he has gotten happy with that.
Few days after, we hang out with one of our mutual friend groups ‚Äîhis gf is there too, is my friend‚Äî to celebrate his bd in a coffee shop. I felt uncomfortable at first because I knew we had a pending talk about why I got away from him ‚ÄîI had told him that I didn't wanted to make his gf have insecurity, jealousy or misunderstandings, which is it's true, but it wasn't the entire reason‚Äî but eventually I did talk with my guy best friend and I forgot. In some moments, I did talk with the other guy, just silly little chats in company of our other friends. When we left the place, we walked to see some stores. In one moment, which I don't remember well, I was looking some clear plastic boxes when he comes close and ask if I wanted him to ask the price, which I decline and say I was just looking. We talk for a while before he says that we'll go to the store next to the one we were at that moment, which I accept. I was calm the entire moment since we spoke, and happy too. Before that, he gave me a letter. He never did that before.
Long story short, we did go with our friends to lots of stores, we talked, laughed and lots of things. In one moment when we where just us at night, he asked me if I will tell him the explanation of why I aparted. I agreed and he confessed me ‚Äîlike in the moment we were visiting stores at the afternoon‚Äî that he liked my friendship and we were very united in thoughts and mannerisms of acting, that we were almost the same. We enjoyed our silence for a bit before I go back home.
When I read the letter, I got speechless. In there, he wrote that I'm his best friend. And that's what I ever wanted with him. A relationship of bestfriends.

When I was with him, I didn't felt like exploding from emotion like before, but a calm and enjoying the moments that left me questioning if my feelings faded or if I already got over that.

*How did this happen?* 

I keep asking myself that. Last night I was watching the moon landing with my family, dreaming of becoming an astronaut, and now I‚Äôm covering behind a chair in a strange spaceship in fear, watching four aliens yell at each other. One of them is Avaatli -*No. To-bi-as?*- the alien that, in some weird way, both protected and kidnapped me and my family at the same time. The other one is new. Tobias -*is that right?*- had told me, that it -*or he? It? He. It‚Äôs ‚Äòhe‚Äò. Probably.*- called reinforcements. And those reinforcements are the three new aliens I guess.

Two of them are just as pale as Av-, *Tobias*, while the third one has much darker skin, which is fascinating. 

Tobias is currently arguing with a different alien, this one is slightly smaller, with short yellow hair. I think it‚Äôs a girl? 

I can‚Äôt understand their language, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that they are talking about me and my family, but mostly me, since they keep gesturing at us. And both of them are loud, screaming at each other. The new alien gestures back to my family, who are still unconscious in a small cell separated from the main room by a thick sheet of glass. I don‚Äôt know, what Tobias gave them, but they haven‚Äôt moved since I woke up over an hour ago, no matter what happened in the room, or how loud it got. 
I look back at the aliens. the one with the yellow hair points back at me yelling something. Tobias moves to stand between me and the other alien. This can‚Äôt be good!

""T-Tobias?"", I‚Äôm scared. I can deal with Tobias, I think, but these new aliens are different. I don‚Äôt know them or how to approach them and they definitely don‚Äôt seem to like me!

Tobias turns to me, shooting me a brief smile, ""Do not worry, Shaviit. Everything will be alright."", then he goes back to arguing.
 
They go on like that for a while, then the yellow-haired one throws her (?) hands up in the air. Tobias places his right hand on my shoulder, his left arm is still in a sling, and pulls me closer to him. He gently guides me back into one of the two metal chairs, sitting me down in it. ""Alright Shaviit, my friends and I will now go and destroy the Galrix nest. Afterward, we will go back to your house and remove all evidence of alien presence. You and your family will have to stay here. You must not leave the ship for your own safety.""

I nod. Tobias again smiles at me, before his expression tenses somewhat. ""Also, my colleague Vivien"", he gestures to the yellow-haired alien, ""insists on taking a blood sample from you.""
 
I freeze. *What?!* The aliens want my blood! Why do they want my blood?! What do they need my blood for?! 
Fear rushes through me! I shake my head, ""No."", I whisper, ""No! Tobias no! I-""

Tobias grabs my shoulder, making a shushing sound. ""I know, Shaviit. But you do not need to be afraid. It is just a small sample. We want to know, why you are so resilient against our drugs.""

""A-and then?"", I manage to ask, fearful tears pricking in my eyes, ""W-will you u-use that to-"", I can‚Äôt say it.

*Do they want to drug me again?*

""No!"", Tobias shouts almost immediately, ""No, Shaviit. I will not drug you. I promised you that I would not hurt you again, remember?""

Behind Tobias, the yellow-haired alien, Vi-vi-en, *or was it Vii-vii-en?* *I‚Äôm not sure.*, makes a displeased sound, and twists her eyes in a creepy manner. Why does she look so angry? Instinctively I reach for Tobias‚Äò arm, trying to hide behind him. Tobias turns around, glaring at her, ""We will not harm him again, Vivian."", he says. I think he keeps using my language on purpose. The other one doesn‚Äôt. She keeps talking in their strange language, gesturing towards me. Tobias also twists his eyes. *Heavens, that looks so creepy!* 

Vivi-en keeps talking, now pointing at my family. My eyes dart toward the cell, and then back to Tobias. ""Do not worry."", he says, ""Your family will be fine. They will stay asleep for quite some time. This is how the drugs are supposed to work.""

I stare at the alien in slight disbelief. He keeps saying that he doesn‚Äôt mean to hurt us but then says things like that, completely casually. I don‚Äôt think he realizes just how scary he is. Tobias reaches out to pad my shoulder. ""Do not worry. We will take care of the Galrix first.""

He grabs his weapon from the table. ""Behind the other door in the hallway is my living quarter. There is some food in the fridge there, I am sure, you are hungry by now. Everything else can wait until we return."" 

The other three aliens make their way toward the exit. Tobias gets up as well and is immediately bombarded with shouts from the others. This time however the argument doesn‚Äôt seem to be about me. The dark-skinned one walks toward Tobias, pointing at his wounds. Tobias argues some more, gesturing wildly with his good hand. Eventually, they seem to reach some form of conclusion, because the other three seem to give up. Tobias fastens his gun on his belt, grinning triumphantly, then he joins the other at the door. Tobias presses the bracelet around his wrist, and Avaatli‚Äôs skin appears around him. *I will not get used to that.* The other aliens do the same, also growing blue skin and white hair. *This is just a trick. Just technology.* I‚Äôve to keep reminding myself. One of the aliens looks like the cashier in the supermarket in town.

*No. I‚Äôm not dealing with that. Not now.* 

""I will be back soon, Shaviit."", Tobias says, ""Do not worry. And please, do not touch anything here in the cockpit.""
Then the aliens disappear through the door.

* * * 

I sit in that chair for some time. So this is the cockpit, huh? My gaze wanders back to my family. Tobias was right, they‚Äôre still asleep. Still behind that glass. My attempt to wake them by banging against the glass doesn‚Äôt help. If I only know, how to open that cell. Tobias pressed some button on one of the computers, but I couldn‚Äôt see which one. And there are lots of computers. And even more buttons. 

For a moment I consider just pressing every single button until the cell opens, but who knows what all the other buttons and switches are for? I could break something important, or accidentally activate some strange alien weapon, like that gas! Maybe there‚Äôs something in the ship that could help me!

Plus, Tobias said I could go into his quarter and eat something, so technically I have the allowance to move around the ship, right? And if I find something useful by accident, I can‚Äôt be blamed, right?
I start with the cockpit itself. If you ignore all the computers and Screens, it‚Äôs surprisingly empty. I find a shelf with some papers on it. I pull them out of the shelf, only to realize a fatal flaw in my plan; I can‚Äôt read the alien Script. So even if I find a manual or something, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to read it. I don‚Äôt even know what a manual would look like! 

*Damn it!* 

Still, I continue looking around for a while. Some of the screens are turned on, showing different kinds of diagrams and tables that I don‚Äôt understand. One wall has a strange painting on it. Three thick horizontal stripes in blue, green, and brown, overlayed with six crisscrossing yellow stripes. In the middle sits a black circle with a cross running through it. Perhaps it‚Äôs a flag? It certainly looks like it.

My stomach rumbles. When was the last time I ate something? 

*Tobias said something about food in a fridge, right?*

With a last look at my family, I make my way down the hallway. There aren‚Äôt many rooms in that ship, three to be precise. Aside from the cockpit, there is the room with the medical equipment and the door that should have the living quarter behind it. There‚Äôs also a metal trapdoor at the end of the hallway, but it's locked with some strange device and I can‚Äôt figure out how to open it, so I turn to the living quarter. 
The living quarter is a large room. In its center stands a round metal table, with two chairs placed around it. On the left wall is a small kitchenette, and on the right wall are two niches, in one I can see a pillow and a blanket, so that must be a bed, the second one is stuffed full of what seems to be clothing. Opposite the entrance is another door. It has been left slightly ajar so I can see, what seems to be a bathroom. Then there are some shelves and cupboards standing against the walls. Some seem to have books in them, so not very interesting to me. 
Hesitantly I step into the room. I check out the kitchenette. I rummage around for a bit, in the fridge is a canister with some soup, something that might be cheese, and some red-flesh-thing. After unearthing a spoon from a drawer, I try a small sip from that strange soup, only to spit it right out! *Heavens is that spicy!* How can anyone eat something like that?! I grab that cheese thing instead and begin nibbling at it. It tastes edible. The same goes for the bread I find on the counter. 

I continue looking around. On a shelf by the bed, I spot a small picture frame. It holds some sort of photo, in a quality I‚Äôve never seen before! The colors are vibrant and the contours are so sharp it looks like reality! The picture shows two pale aliens. One seems to be a woman, while the second one is much smaller. I think it‚Äôs a boy? Both have the same brown hair as Tobias, but the three-colored eyes look different. By now I‚Äôve noticed that one color can be different from the rest. All alien eyes are white on the outside, with a black dot in the middle, but the color around the black dot changes from alien to alien. Tobias is green, but the two aliens in the picture have a blue color. There‚Äôs something written at the bottom of the picture, but, just like everything else, I can‚Äôt read it.

I can‚Äôt find anything else that looks useful, so I turn to leave the room. *Maybe I‚Äôll just start pushing some buttons after all.* Then I start feeling thirsty. I try looking around for something to drink. There comes water out of the faucet, but I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs drinkable. I know that some water from the faucets in the quarry isn‚Äôt. So I keep searching until find what I‚Äôm looking for, a small plastic bottle with water. And next to it a simple, white ceramic mug. In it is some dark liquid.

*Huh.*

Drivin' by my curiosity I pick the mug up. The liquid inside is cold, but it must‚Äôve been hot at some point, because why else the mug? I can still smell a soft, lingering scent coming from the liquid. Behind the mug stands a strange machine, holding a can still full of the dark liquid. What is that?

*And can I drink it?*

The question comes to my mind before I can stop it. The liquid is in a mug, so it has to be meant for drinking it does smell intriguing, in a strange way and what harm could one little sip cause? 

*A lot. A lot of harm!* 

I swallowed the first sip when I taste the bitterness. I spit the second sip out! It‚Äôs bitter. Really bitter! Unbearably bitter! 

*Heavens that stuff is disgusting!*

I should‚Äôve learned from that soup! Just how do those aliens manage to eat anything like that?! 

I look at the mug in my shaking hands. 

*Wait, shaking?*

Why are my hands shaking?! A strange sensation spreads through my body. My head is buzzing. The world suddenly looks razor-sharp! I become hyper-aware of everything within the room!

*Wow!*

I look at the dark liquid in the mug. What is that? And why can‚Äôt I stop bouncing? I‚Äôm shaking all over by now. I feel great! 

""Shaviit?""

I spin around. Tobias stands in the doorway! He‚Äôs back already? It hasn‚Äôt been that long, has it? He smiles at me. ""Have you found something to eat?"", he asks. ""I hope there was-"", he stops, staring at me intently. I‚Äôm still shaking. ""Shaviit? Are you alright?""
His three-colored eyes land on my hands. I‚Äôm still holding the mug. Tobias' expression shifts into something that looks like fear. He rips the mug from my hands! 

""Did you drink that?!"", he almost yells. I nod hesitantly. I‚Äôm getting the feeling, that I maybe shouldn‚Äôt have done that. 
Tobias‚Äò expression turns from fear to horror. Without any explanation, he grabs me by the arm and drags me across the hallway into the medicine room. I‚Äôm about to protest when my world suddenly starts spinning! I go from feeling amazing to feeling horrendous in a single second! I suddenly have a splitting headache, my stomach begins to hurt and I feel like I‚Äôm about to vomit! This can‚Äôt be good!

I vaguely register Tobias placing me on the bed in the medical room. Everything is spinning now! 

*What was in that cup?* 

Tobias is dashing around the room, at least I think he does because I‚Äôm starting to see double. I feel something prick my arm. I flinch, trying to pull away. ""Wha‚Äôs that?"", I slur, *No, definitely not good!*
""Medicin."", Tobias answers. ""I need to flush your system from the toxin.""

""Toxin?"", I manage. 

Tobias doesn‚Äôt answer, he just keeps rushing around. I try to follow his movements, but my head is swimming and I can‚Äôt focus. Tobias rustles around next to the bed some more, before sitting down on a chair next to the bed. ""Shaviit, why did you have to drink that?"", he sighs. I don‚Äôt manage to formulate an answer. Suddenly I feel very, very tired. 
""I hope that your drug resilience helps you with this."", Tobias mumbles. I can‚Äôt quite focus. My eyes grow heavy. Everything is foggy. 

*I have to vomit!*

I turn to my side. That‚Äôs the only warning Tobias get‚Äôs. Turns out, he‚Äôs prepared. He holds a  bucked under my head, rubbing my back as I heave. 
I roll back onto the bed, shutting my eyes tightly against the suddenly way to bright light. I keep telling myself that this helps against my headache. I lay unmoving for a while before my stomach acts up again. 
I feel like I have some long hours ahead of me. 

* * *

I don‚Äôt know how much time I spent lying on that bed before my head slowly starts to clear up. Slowly I sit up, the room is still spinning somewhat, but it‚Äôs not nearly as bad anymore. I also haven‚Äôt thrown up in a while, so that's probably a good sign. A glass of water appears in my field of vision. Tobias stands in front of me, holding the glass in his good hand. ""Here, you need to drink something."", he says. I turn my head away. I don‚Äôt want to drink anything! The thought alone makes my stomach turn. ""You have to drink."" Tobias says, ""You are dehydrated. It is just water."" I eventually take the glass, slowly sipping at it. I notice that there‚Äôs a thin plastic tube connected to a needle sticking out of my left arm. The tube runs up a metal stand and ends in a plastic bag with a clear liquid in it. 

""What happened?"" I ask. My voice is hoarse. 
Tobias stiffens, suddenly looking very guilty. ""You poisoned yourself."", he says. I stare at him in shock. ""Poison?!"", I yell, ""What poison?!"", I jump from the bed. Bad idea! The room starts spinning intensely. I start swaying. Tobias catches me before I can fall, helping me back onto the bed. ""Please take it slow, Shaviit."", he says. I rip my arm away from him. 

""Why do you have poison in your kitchen?‚Äú, I feel a familiar feeling of dread creep back into me. The idea of a strange alien poison hidden in a drink suddenly becomes a very real threat.
Tobias drags his good hand through his hair, looking very exhausted, ""It is the neurotoxin C‚ÇàH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄN‚ÇÑO‚ÇÇ, commonly known as ‚Äòcaffeine‚Äò. Humans consume it in small dosages as a stimulant.""

I stare at him in complete shock. I can‚Äôt believe what I just heard, ""You poison yourself?! On purpose?!""

""It is not dangerous to us. At least when consumed in small quantities. It keeps us awake and raises our productivity. But nearly every other species can not digest it."", Tobias turns to face me, ""I am sorry, Shaviit. I told you, you could take anything from the kitchen. I did not think about the coffee still being there, or else I would have warned you about it.""

Tobias reaches for a bottle behind him, handing it to me, ""Here, you have to drink a lot of water. It helps dilute the caffeine and flush your system."" 

He walks back over to the cupboards, pulls out another one of the small plastic bags, before returning to the bed, changing the bag hanging above it. ""This will also help clean your body."", he says, gently smiling at me, ""Now try to rest some more.""

I nod hesitantly, still a bit scared. *The aliens poison themselves?! For fun?!* The idea freaks me out, but I do as I‚Äôm told and stay in bed, resting and drinking my water.

""Where are the others?"", I ask after a while.

""They are still out raiding the Galrix nest."", Tobias answers, seeming glad for the change of topic. ""I was sent back after showing them the way, because of my injuries.""

""And they can kill them?"", I ask with a mixture of hope and doubt. Tobias nods, ""They should be fine. Unlike me, they know what awaits them and they are better prepared."" His expression turns dark, ""However, I doubt that we will be able to rid ourselves of them for good. And sometimes I am not sure if we should.""

I stare at Tobias in utter shock. *He can‚Äôt mean that, can he?!* ""Why?!"", I yell, ""They‚Äôre evil! They tried to kill us!""

Tobias takes a deep breath, ""I know that Shaviit. That is why we keep fighting them. They also once tried to wipe my species out, as they did to many others. But still, we would end an entire species."", he stops looking at me, starring into nothing, ""A life taken can not be brought back, a culture erased is gone forever. We fight the Galrix because they wish for us to disappear from the universe. When everything else had failed, we saw no other way but violence. It made us stronger too. The fight against the Galrix had a large part in making us who we are. Our strength protects us, and we can be proud to have it, but violence should always be the last resort. The loss of life should never be taken lightly. We are strong to protect ourselves and others, not to play god and decide who has the right to live. This is a lesson taught to every soldier in our realm. Do you understand that, Shaviit?""

I stare at Tobias in confusion and amazement. *Strength to protect others*. I mull over his words for a while. ""Am I someone you need to protect?"", I ask before I realize it. Tobias smiles at me, ""Yes. You and your species. Although I seem to not be very good at it."", he says with an awkward chuckle, ""I told you before, that we wanted to offer you our protection, right?""

I nod, remembering him talking about being a scout. Tobias continues, ""We want to offer you a place in our realm, as partners. Your kind is very similar to ours you know? Not only in your physical appearance but in the way you think and express yourself as well. Although, had the situation remained calm, I would have suggested waiting with the first contact, until the idea of evil aliens invading your world lost some of 
its prevalence.""

""And now you will just do it?"", I ask.

""Well, we will not just drop from the sky and confront you with the existence of a large, alive universe. That is not an ideal way of doing that.""

I can‚Äôt help but agree with that, thinking back to the fear and terror that dominated my life in the last three weeks. 

""My government will contact your governments."", Tobias continues to explain, ""Once the initial shock has worn off, they will think about a way to inform the public about our existence.""

I nod again, still sipping my water. By now, the room has stopped spinning. 

For a moment we sit together in silence before I finally work up the courage to ask Tobias a question, that has been on my mind for the entire day, ""And what about my family? What happens to us now?""
Tobias looks at me with confusion, before his expression shifts to understanding. ""You have nothing to fear, Shaviit. Nothing will happen to you. After my friends are done with the Galrix nest, we will clean up your house, and try to make it look like a break-in. The gas used to render them unconscious should also have erased the memories so that they can continue living as before.""

I blink at Tobias in slight shock. *How does he say these things so casually?*

""You are a different story."", the alien continues, seeming oblivious to my shock. *Wait! What does he mean by me being a different story?* 
I swallow heavily, sliding a bit further up the bed. ""T-tobias?"", I ask, fear gripping my voice. The alien's eyes widen in shock. ""Oh no! No, Shaviit, no! I will not hurt you."", he rushes to reassure me, ""I just have to ask you to keep quiet about your knowledge. We do not know, how long it will take to establish proper contact between your and my governments. If you now start claiming you met aliens, not only would you be regarded as insane, but it could also compromise the attempt at peaceful first contact. So, for your own safety, please stay quiet about us.""

""Then why do you always sound so scary?! Half of the things you say sounds like a threat!"", I shout. Tobias looks taken aback, before rubbing his neck awkwardly. ""I told you I am not trained in first contact. Again, I. Am. Not. Good. At. This! I am awful at first contact! I can not even talk to other humans properly half the time!""
I stare at Tobias for a moment, then I burst out laughing. The idea of a socially awkward alien just seems funny to me. *Maybe it‚Äôs the stress?* 
Tobias looks bewildered for a moment, then he also begins to chuckle. ""You are a good kid, Shaviit."", he says. 

A loud beeping startles me out of my laughter. Tobias walks towards the door, tapping on a small screen next to it. ""It looks like the others are back.""

The return of the three other aliens is not nearly as spectacular as I imagined it. They just come in, drop their weapons, and shuffle into the living quarter. Tobias goes to greet them and I follow, still a bit wobbly on my legs. The conversation between the aliens quickly, but by now predictably, escalates into a shouting match, as soon the first one notices the needle in my arm and my pale face. Tobias does scream back but doesn‚Äôt seem to defend himself that much. The dark-skinned one even smacks Tobias on the back of the head, like he‚Äôs a misbehaving child, before motioning for me to sit down in a chair. I eventually do, after some encouragement from Tobias, the only even slightly trustworthy alien in the room.

The shouting eventually dies down, as the aliens descend into a more civil discussion. Tobias eventually turns to me, smiling gently. *It looks a lot more natural when he isn‚Äòt wearing Avaatli‚Äôs face over it.*
""Shaviit, my friends will now go back to your house, to clean up a bit. Afterward, we will take you and your family home, alright?""
*Home.* I know that I can‚Äôt have been away for long, but it feels like it‚Äôs been forever. I look back at the alien, nodding. ""Alright."" I say.
Tobias nods back with a smile ""Alright, and in the meantime, we will wake up your family.""

* * * 

I sit on a brand-new couch in our living room, watching TV. 
The aliens' plan worked fightingly well. When I first came back into the house, nothing reminded of the attack of monsters from outer space. The bodies were gone and the blood had been cleaned. All traces of claw marks and alien laser blasters had been removed, only the broken door and window remained. Tobias friends -maybe colleagues?- had taken some money with them, to make this look like a burglary gone wrong. 

When my family first woke up everything had been very chaotic. Tobias had brought them back to his small hut, where they had finally come to. Mom and Dad had been in a panic, franticly looking for Tharviik and me. To my complete astonishment, Tobias had been right; my family could truly not remember the Galrix attack. When Tobias, once again disguised as Avaatli, told them of the supposed burglary, they seemed to believe him. 

Or at least Mom and Tharviik seemed to. I‚Äôm not so sure about Dad. Two weeks have passed since the monsters attacked our home, and Dad has been acting strange. He hasn‚Äôt said anything and has even thanked ‚ÄòAvaatli‚Äò for ‚Äòsaving‚Äò us again, but he has been unusually quiet since he woke up. 
Now that I think about it, Dad was awake longer than Mom and Tharviik. The two were knocked out almost instantly, but Dad had stayed conscious a while longer, he even said something to Tobias back then. 

Dad had taken the last two weeks off work, to help clean up the house and stay with us. Today he had been back to work. ‚ÄòAvaatli‚Äò had been over occasionally as well, mostly on Mom‚Äòs invitation. Sometimes he helps with repairing the house. He keeps acting normal, or at least like he did before, even towards me. Just Dad keeps a polite distance from his friend, occasionally shooting him suspicious glances. 

Mom and Tharviik are out, doing some shopping, or rather Mom had to do some shopping and dragged Tharviik along for help. I had stayed home to wait for Dad, who had come home a few minutes ago. Right now Dad sits next to me on the couch. He has his arm wrapped tightly around me. Very tightly. I think he‚Äôs still afraid, that I could disappear again, since the attack on the house even more so. 

""Shaviit?"", he says suddenly, breaking our comfortable silence, ""I want to ask you something."" I look at him expectantly. ""It‚Äôs about Avaatli.‚Äù
I tense ever so slightly. 

""You know how you used to tell me that you find Avaatli a bit strange?""

*Shit!* 

""Yes?"", I ask carefully.

*Please stop asking!*

""What exactly did you mean by that?""

""I know I was rude.‚Äù, I say hastily, ""I probably just imagining things!""

""I‚Äôm not so sure about that anymore.""

*Oh no!*

I try to think of something I could say when suddenly the TV starts acting up. The image flickers, like someone messing with the antenna, then the news channel banner appears on the screen. They‚Äôre announcing an emergency broadcast! Dad tenses next to me.

The News Anchor appears, he looks pale, and scared. ""G-good evening, L-ladies and Gentlemen. T-today we r-received the f-following video from the p-palerment. We will n-now show said v-video. I m-must warn you, the f-following images could be d-disturbing to some v-viewers.""
The image changes again. A strange figure appears on the screen. A pale face with three-colored eyes. 

Tobias' voice echoes through my head, his words about first contact playing in my mind *So it‚Äôs happening!* 

""Heavens!"", Dad curses beside me, pulling me closer. His face twisting in horror.  

""People of Naiila. My name is Sophia. I represent the Terran Empire. Do not fear us, we come to you in peace.""",3,1734887501.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

A week prior to all of this I accidentally fell on my left side in the night in a puddle. After about a week or so is when I started to experience constipation symptoms about the time I had coffee and a turkey sandwich for lunch. After drinking a lot of hot water, chia seeds, etc it was a bit normal again, however my lower back was super sore. I attributed the soreness to the constipation and not the fall. On the weekend I had lamb curry and then again I became constipated for a few days. Tried different things and it was until I had tostadas which has a lot of beans my stool became normal again. However my lower back is still a bit sore especially on my right side now but a lot better after doing some stretches and applying a heating pad. However my stool has been thin the past 5-6 days and I have to strain a bit for it to come out. I do get the sensation that I have to go though. Usually I've been going 2-3 times in the morning. Normally I got 1-2 daily in the past. I've been trying hip flexor exercises , trying to incorporate more fiber like oatmeal and bananas into my diet, and trying to be more active. I do have a sitting job as well and sit a lot during the day. There is no blood or mucus or any of that. I did have some mucus come out but that was when I was feeling pretty constipated and was straining a lot. However I am trying to strain less but I still have to somewhat.  I did have a lot of bloating which has decreased as well as gas. I do burp a bit still usually during the nights after I had dinner. I'm not sure what is causing my stool to be like this? Is it the fall or something else? Any advice would be great. Thanks",1,1734887238.0,Constipation,2,1.0,False

I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, or IRL/local and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

Hello, I am 21 years old (male) and have been struggling with insomnia for the past two months. Every night, when I go to bed, I wake up after 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours of sleep‚Äîit varies. I feel completely exhausted and unwell. I‚Äôve been to the doctor, had blood tests, stool tests, thyroid tests, and checked TSH hormone levels; everything came back normal.

Four months ago, I was taking Accutane (20-30mg daily) from March to July. I had to stop due to headaches and redness in my eyes. At the end of August, I started experiencing digestive problems like incomplete bowel movements, frequent trips to the restroom, and stomach discomfort. I‚Äôve also noticed a decrease in libido, and I constantly feel cold, especially in my hands and feet. I tested negative for H. pylori.

I am not working; I‚Äôm a student (private school) with a decent social life. My parents support me financially, and I have hobbies and interests, so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm under significant stress. A psychologist told me I am slightly insecure and anxious, which they said is normal for my age. I‚Äôve seen a sleep specialist who prescribed me zolpidem (Belbien 10mg), which helped for one night but stopped working after that. I‚Äôve also tried valerian tea, chamomile, and melatonin, but none of these helped.

Some additional information:

I eat healthily.

I don‚Äôt smoke, no alohol, consume coffee, or use energy drinks.

I walk 6-7 km daily and stay active.

I used to go to the gym but stopped because my body feels like it‚Äôs falling apart, and recovery takes several days.

I don‚Äôt spend much time on my computer or phone and always turn them off two hours before bed.


I don‚Äôt know what else to do‚ÄîI feel helpless. Is it possible that I have a deficiency in some vitamins (D, Mg, K, Ca, etc.)?
Could Accutane have caused some damage to my body that is now causing the insomnia?
What other tests can I take, and what should I check for?
I‚Äôve also noticed my vision is deteriorating, which is extremely frustrating.

Hi everyone, 


I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc. 


As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. üôÇ

I just stated my third bag of coffee.  I thought everything was going well but this bag has thrown my output asunder.  

tl;dr: Switched coffee beans, using same dialed in grind/etc: 2X output out in 8 seconds.

  
Details:

Looking backward / dialed in settings:

* Profitec: 93 degrees. 9 bars at portafilter (10 at dial). Heated portafilter
* Niche Zero: Setting 21 (one past the espresso word)
* 14g in 21g out in 20 seconds (14g to 28g in 28-31 sec)
* Basket: 14g IMS (Flat basket) and single dose from Profitec (Tapered. I think it's a 14g! Anyone actually know the dosage amounts for the two baskets that Profitec gives you?! I can't find it documented anywhere)
* Coffee: Two bags, both medium dark roast. Minor dialing in for grinding 1-2 difference on Niche setting)

What happened today:

* Profitec: No change
* Niche: 21
* 14g in 21g out in 8 seconds.  Bitter like nobody's business
* Niche: 14: 14g in 21g out in 120 sec
* Niche: 17: 14g in 21g out in 15 sec
* Niche: 15: 14g in 21g out in 85 sec

I gave up at this point.  I will try Niche 16 next time...but I'm surprised that the change in bean had such a huge change in output, it has me both confused and thinking that there's something I should learn here.  ",1,1734886854.0,espresso,12,1.0,False

I was watching a lot of porn and this was around the time of ""two girls, one cup"" was going viral. I semi jokingly posted an add for a woman to poop on me and I'd pay her for her trouble. I mostly did it just to see who would respond and as a joke. However a rather attractive young woman replied, she said she did this for a previous boyfriend once and could do it for me if I still wanted. This was the first reply I got that actually tempted me to do it. The others sounded flaky, I had people insulting me and I even had MEN asking if I'd be interested in a guy! Other than what we were discussing, she seemed very nice, matter of fact and had a casual picture that looked like a pretty girl next door, she wasn't a model but pretty and had a quirky style since she's an artist. 

I got to her place and she was outside smoking with some friends or roommates. She said we'd have the place alone though. We went in, up a narrow stairway and to the second floor. We got to her apartment and showed me her studio and some drawings and paintings she was working on. She was very talented! We briefly talked about art because I used to be really into drawing. She then asked if we could go and do what I came for because she reeeally had to go! I gave her an envelope with the cash and we went to her bathroom. She had a plastic tarp down with old paint stains in the tub and said I could lie there. She said not to worry because they paint was all dry on the plastic sheet and sorry because it's all she had available. I took off my clothes and she sort of squatted over me with her feet on the tub sides. 

She just casually pulled down her sweatpants and started peeing immediately. It was a super cold day that day and her apartment was not all that warm. Plus, I was now naked. I really liked the feeling of her warm pee on me and there was a lot. Then I heard a fart and a tiny turd landed on me. I immediately realized that I didn't care for this fantasy in reality and it was just gross. It was too late though because right after that she let strained briefly and a massive log came out that seemed it was too big for her body. It was soo fast. It was all over me. She got up and said she'd be outside once I got cleaned up and to take my time. I just gave a thumbs up because I didn't want to open my mouth. She had a trash bag and cleaning supplies nearby and I cleaned up myself with paper towels and wet wipes and then threw the plastic tarp in the garbage bag. I took looong shower and used a lot of soap but could not get the smell out it seemed. I finally came out and she was painting at her easel. She asked if I was ok and if I liked it and I said something about it being a cool experience. She apologized and said she didn't know it would be that much and I said not to worry and I doubt you can control it. She made me a coffee before I left and I joked that she was worried about me getting old paint on me from the plastic tarp in light of what was about to happen and she cracked up laughing! I am still glad I did it because she was a cool, uinhibited person I would not have met otherwise and it was a unique experience I tried and found out I don't like. It basically cured me of my porn addiction too. ",32,1734886600.0,confessions,12,0.82,False

Albert Camus keeping in line with absurdism wrote that there is only one question that matters: should I kill myself or have a cup of coffee?

Meanwhile Steinbeck says every person at the end of their life asks one fundamental question: A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of life, will have left only the hard, clean questions:¬†Was it good or was it evil?¬†Have I done well - or ill?

I think both these questions when combined mirror the two fundamental problems that most people start and end their life with. The first, by Camus, asks whether one has the strength to endure life with all its twists and turns and pain and absurdity. The second, asked by Steinbeck, begs whether that strength endured to live a life of relative peace and kindness. 

Take together, I think both these quotes, by two distinct writers, offer a sense of harmony that wouldn't be possible on their own.

Kindly let me know what you think, even if you think I'm crazy.

1hk2fq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1hk2fq0/my_sp_is_avoidantor_so_i_thought/,My SP is avoidant‚Ä¶or so I thought ,"

Backstory:

SP and I matched on a dating app at the end of August. Our connection was instant and after a few days, she said she couldn‚Äôt wait any longer to meet me and we planned a date for that coming Friday. We live 2 hours away and I drove up to meet her for coffee and to play Uno. It was an amazing date that lasted 5 hours, and we only stopped because she had to meet her parents for dinner. At the end of the date she bought me flowers which no one has ever done for me, and we had an amazing kiss. We immediately planned a second date for the following weekend where she would come down to me.

This went on for a few weeks - seeing each other every weekend. We had originally intended to switch off who goes to who but for various reasons it became easier for her to come to me every weekend. During one of our dates we got on the topic of attachment styles. I said I have a mostly secure attachment style but can have moments of becoming anxious. She said she‚Äôs also secure but can get avoidant. She also had previously told me she can have commitment issues.

Fast forward, we come up on our final weekly date before she‚Äôs gonna be out of town, meaning we won‚Äôt see each other for two weeks. We both were sad saying goodbye to each other but nothing else was out of the ordinary. This was on a Monday. During our time together, I knew her work schedule so I always knew when I wouldn‚Äôt hear from her much because she was busy (she works two jobs and I‚Äôm self employed). That Thursday, she texted me in the morning and said she had a super busy day ahead so wouldn‚Äôt be on her phone much, but said I could text her, send her tiktoks and snapchats, etc as usual and she‚Äôd respond to me when she could. Even though I didn‚Äôt ask for the reassurance, I appreciated that she had the foresight to tell me that and thanked her for it. And yet somehow, this is where things got weird.

On Friday, she went straight from work to her place and then on the road to her best friend‚Äôs house for the weekend and didn‚Äôt text me at all the whole time. Not a big deal, I knew she‚Äôd had a long week and was eager to have time off. But over the course of the weekend, every text or message I sent her was opened and ignored. For the first time since we met, my anxiety started to kick in. I will say, I have no problem being left on delivered - ie you haven‚Äôt opened my message yet. But having messages opened and then ignored does tend to trigger me. So I started to spiral and think one weekend away was all it took for her to realize she doesn‚Äôt want to be with me (dramatic af)

The rest is kind of a blur but essentially over the following week her avoidance/commitment issues started coming into play and she was making lots of inconsistent excuses for why she thought we should go our separate ways. At the time I got very reactive because my emotions were so high.  I was a bit of an ass. After a few weeks I sent her a text with my collected thoughts, tried to make amends, but she never replied (which may have been my own doing because I didn‚Äôt think she would).

Manifesting/LOA:

My introduction to the idea of manifesting was the book You Are a Badass by Jen Sincero, which I first read probably around 2018. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was about manifestation on the first read because it‚Äôs cleverly disguised as a general self help book. But I come back to it all the time and eventually realized the whole book is about letting go of limiting beliefs, knowing what you want, and trusting you already have it. But honestly what got me back into the law of assumption during this incident with SP was TikTok. While I was stressing about what had happened my fyp started feeding me videos about how to bring someone back, and here we are.

Honestly recently I was feeling very upset and disappointed in the whole idea. I fell for the content creators saying ‚Äútry this ONE thing to get your ex back‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna help you manifest a text in 60 seconds,‚Äù only to try it and immediately be disappointed because it didn‚Äôt work. And don‚Äôt even get me STARTED on the tarot readings! I‚Äôm not saying it couldn‚Äôt work for someone else, but I was in such a low and skeptical place, and so tired of feeling like I was trying and then being let down, it just made things worse.

The other day I got fed up and basically said to myself ‚Äúwe need to start over.‚Äù I stopped watching any TikToks about manifestation, stopped all the methods I‚Äôd been cycling through, except meditation, and just allowed myself to relax and not worry about anything for a couple days. I wanna be clear, I truly 100% believe in the law and know it works. I was skeptical about it working for me, not about it working in general. And I also knew I wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace to utilize it successfully, and by trying these methods so hard and watching all these creators, I knew I was actually pushing my desire away instead bringing it in.

I‚Äôve been slowly implementing affirmations again, switching the narrative inward to improve my self concept (which honestly is already pretty good, but I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt and would help me to stop seeking SP‚Äôs validation). When I felt myself getting a little discouraged again, I finally had something click.

I didn‚Äôt realize it for a while, but I was really focusing on bringing in the old version of my SP - the avoidant. I said to myself ‚ÄúI know she‚Äôs avoidant, I know commitment scares her, but once I manifest her in I‚Äôll just make sure I keep my emotions in check so it won‚Äôt trigger her.‚Äù Embarrassing! I think I really had to ‚Äúhear‚Äù myself say that (even though it was in my head) to see how ridiculous it was. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much I affirm or how good my self concept is - an avoidant person is not going to come back. And that‚Äôs when I finally realized the version of my SP that I desire isn‚Äôt avoidant, and therefore I should not be trying to bring that person in.

So I switched my affirmations again. 

- ‚ÄúSP loves being in a committed relationship with me.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSP loves me so much and tells me all the time.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI am SP‚Äôs perfect partner and everything she‚Äôs ever wanted.‚Äù

Things like that.

Now that I‚Äôve had that realization, I‚Äôm feeling really good. I‚Äôve moved past the point of trying to control an outcome and settled into knowing it is here and the 3D has no choice but to conform.

I can‚Äôt wait to come back here with happy updates ü©∑",3,1734886452.0,NevilleGoddard,2,0.6,False

Meanwhile Steinbeck says every person at the end of their life asks one fundamental question: A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of life, will have left only the hard, clean questions:¬†Was it good or was it evil?¬†Have I done well - or ill?

I think both these questions when combined mirror the two fundamental problems that most people start and end their life with. The first, by Camus, asks whether one has the strength to endure life with all its twists and turns and pain and absurdity. The second, asked by Steinbeck, begs whether that strength endured to live a life of relative peace and kindness. 

Take together, I think both these quotes, by two distinct writers, offer a sense of harmony that wouldn't be possible on their own.

Kindly let me know what you think, even if you think I'm crazy. 

Currently reading East of Eden by Steinbeck and I'm loving each chapter as it unfolds.

"," The greatest miracle is to be able to decide. To decide anything is different from other thing, energy from energy, or place from place. Deciding makes all those things change and make sense.

Types. All we have are types‚Äîdifferent types of things and events.  
They happen and turn out to be around.  
And you are a medium of it all.  
You sense things and events in time and relate to them.

So what are the fundamental types of everything?

Matter, Energy, Space, Time, Information, Consciousness aka Decision!

I think we can argue and give different names or delegate extra power from one fundamental type in favor of another. But that is not the point here. What matters is that we truly have different types of ‚Äúeverything‚Äù around us.

https://preview.redd.it/3ow4j2ltjf8e1.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd525d5416bd6d9d7964f5e4472d35ce2209513

Is there a dominant ‚Äútype of everything,‚Äù or are they all of the same ‚Äúpower‚Äù? Let‚Äôs use a special framework to check it out.  

Computational dramaturgy is a study that focuses on events happening. Driven by inner narratives, the stories of our lives follow set goals and try to accomplish them.

Decision is a miracle that emphasizes the transformative power of agency:

1. Decision acts as a catalyst for change, transforming potential into reality.
2. Decision differentiates static elements (matter, energy) into dynamic processes.
3. Decision gives context and coherence, making sense of existence by linking choices to outcomes.

Inside your head, you have the most complexly organized matter with the ability to generate a fundamental type of everything: consciousness. Your brain generates consciousness that sets goals in time‚Äîpersonal goals‚Äîand changes every other fundamental type of everything, or uses them to change each other, to achieve the main set goal!

Whatever you are up to, you set some goal at every moment of now. To sit. To stand. To drink coffee. To become a parent or buy something. And you change the reality around your body to reach those goals! If you are lucky, creative, and persistent enough, you change more of everything around you. You achieve more goals that you set!

This knowledge makes me feel great all the time. Whatever life brings, I focus on trying my best to set good, healthy goals and achieve them.

Computational dramaturgy operates within such a system‚Äîa way of relating things to each other, like a language. It can be sign language, body language, written, or spoken language. When you learn the language of your inner narrative, you understand what your body, mind, and the world around them want and how to get it.

Using this dramaturgical language, that is based on a story creation, that lasts in time, has characters involved, that are viewed by an observer and get to the goal as a main fundamental level and type of reality.

1hk2c1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1hk2c1x/my_experience_in_trying_to_do_self_therapy/,My experience in trying to do self therapy,"After getting off the SSRI last summer, because I couldn‚Äôt believe I had recently put up with so much from people who obviously didn‚Äôt care about me (I thought maybe the medication had made me too numb), all of the suppressed emotional parts came back, and I was able to finally realize what I have been suffering with for so many years--Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. With tireless research and self therapy prompts I found online, also EMDR (There‚Äôs a yellow dot, self EMDR exercise on Youtube), I was able to access and re-experience being inside the four walls of hell of one of my most traumatized parts, where I feel skinned of my humanity, where I am nothing but screaming, naked bones, with no hope of mercy, because my abuser (my father) was enjoying my torment. I didn‚Äôt have the urge to drink because I was facing my most terrifying emotional part, instead of running from it. I was able to feel my anger and think my real thoughts about what he had done to me. I was able to see the abuser‚Äôs ‚Äúgood parts‚Äù as the abuser eliciting affection from me that he did not deserve. I felt completely repulsed. The trauma bond was broken. The next day I had brain fog and ringing in my ears and felt like I had time traveled and I cried off and on.

He had messed up my mind and left me living a nightmare, but I had still been trying to be close to him, even buying him very thoughtful gifts. This realization caused me deep devastation and it took several days for me to come out of it.¬†

Through journaling, I was able to identify 5 emotional parts that when triggered cause me to time travel and be stuck in perceptions of myself and perceptions of life that I had endured while I was trapped with him. They feel completely real and seem to be about my present life, but they are only a trick. I am very grateful that I haven‚Äôt killed myself during one of the episodes, because one of my emotional parts includes suicidal ideation. These EP‚Äôs kept me trapped in mistreatment and self-harm for years afterwards, even though I was no longer trapped with my abuser.¬†

I had been trained by my abuser to serve and make myself useful in order to be shown love, which had never been love at all. I was brainwashed to believe I was worthless and had no right to consider myself a real person worthy of respect. My anger at mistreatment had been buried in my subconscious, because it was so dangerous to show anger to my abuser. I was an easy mark for exploitation by other narcissists. This dynamic was also at play with my mother who‚Äôd abandoned me. I found her when I was 21, and she was able to financially exploit me and use me for narcissistic supply *because* she‚Äôd abandoned me with my abuser. I felt enraged when I realized this.

I wrote my trauma narrative to try to get a grip on my childhood and my young adult past. It helped me to validate to myself that it really was that bad.

At first I wrote it in a third person perspective so I could see if I would feel any empathy for this ‚Äúother person,‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt feel any for myself at all. I cried a lot for this ‚Äúother person‚Äù and then I would say to myself, ‚Äúbut this is me‚Äù afterward, to try to transfer that compassion to myself.¬†

The following is my trauma narrative (Trigger warning: physical abuse) After my narrative, I share how I think the abuse and neglect affected me, and then I list the ANP (Apparently Normal Part) and EP‚Äôs (Emotional Parts) I‚Äôve been able to identify and the new coping methods I‚Äôm trying to use. Lastly, there is a short journal entry.¬†¬†¬†

My mother cut off part of my brother‚Äôs ear because she was drunk while giving him a haircut. In that memory for the longest time, I thought she had just been the babysitter, because she left us alone to play with her sister‚Äôs kids while she got drunk with her sisters so often. We got lice. Eventually she wanted to party in Florida with her siblings, so she left us with a stranger and called her ex-abuser, our father, to come pick us up, but it was also a fuck you to him. I was 3 and a half and my brother was 2. She later said that she‚Äôd been so devastated that we ‚Äúhad been kidnapped‚Äù that she‚Äôd sold and gave everything away and took off to Florida, which meant she knew she wasn‚Äôt just going on vacation, she knew she was abandoning us. I grew up never knowing a mother‚Äôs love and having to be a little parent to my brother. She knew how cruel our father was and she left us unprotected in his care anyway because having fun was more important to her.

I was forced to believe I was inferior, so that my abuser could feel superior and control me, so that I would be a compliant servant. I was terrorized with fear tactics. There are many incidents that my brother remembers that I do not, and probably some that neither of us remember. We had no adult to go to for comfort and I remember crying myself to sleep a lot.

* My brother, at 3 years old, came home crying with bloody feet, because he had worn cowboy boots that were too small, without socks, so our abuser raged at him and beat him up for it. (If we got accidentally hurt and became an inconvenience to him, he would hurt us worse)
* My brother got soap in his eyes in the bathtub, so our abuser held his head under the water and I was convinced I was watching my little brother be murdered. I can still see the horrified look on his face. (He threatened to kill us)
* My brother wouldn‚Äôt eat his cereal, so our abuser dumped the bowl on his head and my brother cried while milk poured into his eyes. (He humiliated us for not doing what he wanted)
* He turned the stove on glowing red and held my hand up to it screaming, ‚ÄúDo you see the light!?‚Äù threatening to burn me. (He would torture us if we displeased him)
* When I was five, he held me up against the wall by my hair, up off the floor, and punched me in the stomach. (He would treat us like grown men in a bar fight)
* He chased me up the stairs kicking me while I screamed for Jesus to help me, because I‚Äôd learned about him in Sunday school and he mocked me, ‚ÄúJesus help me!‚Äù The worst part of this was finding out Jesus wouldn‚Äôt help me. (He would humiliate us for begging for mercy)
* He made us run around the coffee table and seemed to enjoy us being scared. Every now and then he‚Äôd kick us when we ran past. (He would turn our fear into a game for his amusement)
* He threw his coffee cup at us all the time. (If we were in the room with him, there was never a safe distance)
* He beat us on our bare ass with a belt all the time. He would snap the belt with glee before he did it. (He enjoyed our pain)
* My brother said he got beat up for dropping the milk cap once and I can vaguely recall getting in trouble for dropping a grape. (No rules applied, we would be attacked for absolutely any reason)
* He would say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to go down to the work bench‚Äù in the basement and we weren‚Äôt allowed to take our hands off the bench while he hit us in the butt with a 2x4. He devised this setup so the neighbors wouldn‚Äôt hear us screaming. (He created a torture chamber for us and he was proud of it)
* He used the pink plastic hairbrush to hit us, I remember having to hold my hands out while he smacked my knuckles. (He made us volunteer to be physically hurt)
* I asked what the smell was once while we were at his friend‚Äôs house (it was weed) and he slapped me hard across the face. (We were never allowed to question him or he would be insulted and attack us)
* I soothed and comforted him after he was crying and telling us to punch him in the face after he beat us up one time. I don't remember what he did to us before that, but it had to be very bad if he actually felt any remorse. (I felt sorry for him after he abused me, forming the trauma bond)
* I had to watch my brother get beat up and stand by helpless to save him numerous times, which felt worse than when I got beat up. (This formed my rescuer complex)
* He bragged about only hitting us where no one would see the marks. (He made sure there would be no evidence for anyone to see, so that we would never be saved)
* He bragged about smashing our mother‚Äôs head into the wall when they were together and making holes in the wall.
* My cousin was five and running back and forth across the living room so my abuser tripped him.
* We were completely on our own with school, and if our abuser tried to help my brother with homework, he screamed and raged at him during it. (We could never consider him a source of help with absolutely anything, ever)
* He was always calling us names like stupid fuck. (He thought we were beneath him and worthless)
* I drew a stinger on a bee in a picture when I was five and he accused me of drawing a dick on the bee. That‚Äôs when I realized he was crazy and only reacting to things in his head. (He believed he was the master of our internal reality)
* He gaslit us a lot, assigning us ulterior motives to our actions that weren‚Äôt true. (He assassinated our character on a regular basis)
* I was made to punch the little neighbor kid in the face as retaliation for hurting my brother and he acted proud of me. (He encouraged us to be cruel just like him)
* His oldest sister was babysitting us for a day and I think I got a sunburn on my back because we had played in the sprinklers and she rubbed lotion or aloe vera on my back and it was a totally new experience, it was mind-blowingly comforting, but only because I had been completely deprived of affection.
* He made me give him ‚Äúhairdos‚Äù which was rubbing his head and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say no. (We were expected to take care of his need for affection, but he would completely ignore that we had any needs for any emotional comfort ever)
* He would monologue for really long periods of time and I had to just stand there and listen. (He never thought we had anything worthwhile to say)
* I had to call his girlfriend ‚ÄúChris Mommy‚Äù and take baths with her.
* His next girlfriend had a baby and they left me to take care of the baby and that‚Äôs the first diaper I ever changed. I was probably 7 years old.
* There were porn magazines and videos easily accessible to us.
* He told me black guys would rape me and that if I joined the miltary I‚Äôd be a whore and talked about women as only being worthless sex objects and said white women were horrible and he told racist jokes and joked about the Japenese being ‚Äúnuked‚Äù. He was obsessed with Hitler and was always watching the documentaries on The History channel. He especially enjoyed Jack Nicklaus‚Äô character in The Shining. He told me that once I got married, my husband would be the boss of me and he wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to tell me what to do anymore.
* He kept a dog chained in the backyard. He kicked it to ‚Äúmake it mean‚Äù and be a ‚Äúgood guard dog.‚Äù
* He got angry that the dog next door barked too much, so he put rat poison in hamburger balls and threw them over the fence.
* Our dogs disappeared while we were at school and ‚Äúwent to live on a farm‚Äù, one came back by itself, but disappeared again.¬†
* I had to teach myself how to ride a bike, zip a zipper, and tie my shoes. (We were on our own)
* We were unsupervised at very young ages and allowed to walk down a busy road without sidewalks and go far away from the house and into anyone else‚Äôs house. A man literally tried to get us to get in the car with him, but I‚Äôd learned about stranger danger in school.
* We had no heat one winter, so we had to stay in one room with a space heater and get washed in a pot on an electric hotplate. I remember the fridge was empty a lot so we ate a lot of american cheese slices, or me and my brother would have to split one hamburger after our abuser picked us up from the babysitter. In the summer, we would go starved at the babysitter and spend all day outside in the hot sun. She would give us one peanut butter and jelly right before our abuser picked us up so we wouldn‚Äôt tell him we hadn‚Äôt eaten. She would throw my brother across the room and make us stand in the corner for really long periods of time and then smash our heads into the wall when she walked by. We weren‚Äôt allowed to sit on the couch and would have to sit on the floor and my back always hurt. One day I screwed up the courage and told our abuser right in front of the babysitter what she had done to my little brother. Our abuser didn‚Äôt take us back there and then he sugared her gas tank, even though he had done worse to both of us. (He considered us his property)
* He took us to cliffs at a park and let us walk too far away and my little brother almost walked straight off the edge and I grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him back.
* I had scabies on my hands for a really long time and didn‚Äôt get treated for it until my abuser got it, too. (Our health never mattered to him)
* We had roaches crawling on us in our sleep.
* We were home alone a lot and I tripped and broke my tooth off on a bedpost and ran to look in the bathroom mirror and saw blood pouring from my mouth. When my abuser got home from work, he just put the broken piece in an empty pill bottle and neither he, nor any member of his family, took me to the dentist. It was a front tooth and kids made fun of me and I was too scared to smile or talk anymore. This was around the time that my best friend turned on me with her friends and they bullied me at school every day, maybe because of the tooth. I felt the chronic stress hormone‚Äôs assault on my brain suddenly when I hit puberty and it was like a switch flipped and I began exhibiting symptoms of Secondary Structural Dissociation, otherwise known as Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I was scared of the other kids and any attention they gave me. I sat at a lunch table every day alone and was so scared I couldn‚Äôt eat. I was afraid I would forget how to swallow and choke.¬†
* The abuser‚Äôs middle sister got braces during this time. She took me to the hair salon and I was so excited thinking I would get mermaid curls, but she had them cut my hair short and then perm it, so I looked even more ridiculous and felt even more ashamed of how I looked.¬†
* Me and my brother did all the domestic labor and we were pressured and scared before our abuser came home from work because we might have forgotten to do something. I was made to take laundry to and from a laundromat by myself at 11 and do all the dishes every day after I had offered to help one time, because he had been storing all of our dirty dishes under the sink and had been buying disposable dishes.(We would never be anything but servants to him)
* We were evicted and moved a lot and I had social anxiety from always being the new kid at school. I changed elementary schools 3 times, middle school twice, and high school twice.¬†
* Our clothes were shitty and we barely had any and only seemed to get new clothes once a year from the abuser‚Äôs mother. We got bullied. My brother remembers wearing the same clothes two days in a row and a classmate noticing and him telling her he had two of the same outfits, to try to cover it up.
* The abuser‚Äôs sisters and mother knew we had no mother and even though the abuser‚Äôs mother lived across the street, she was never in our apartment to look after us and we didn‚Äôt go over there either. We were always unsupervised while our abuser worked once I turned 11 and my brother was 9. Someone called CPS and I lied and said he left us cooked plates of food in the microwave to eat after school. All I knew was that I had to lie so I wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble with my abuser.
* I used to sing until he told me I sounded really bad.
* I had long hair which I liked so he cut it short and gave me bangs cut back to my ears. (We had no right to decide anything about our body)
* He ordered us around all the time to get him food and drinks.
* He only took us places he wanted to go.
* He thought any pity he offered was love. I realize now that pity allowed him to stay superior in his mind.¬†
* He acted like he was great for not doing some of the abuse tactics his father had done to him, to us, but it was only so he could feel superior to his father; such as not pouncing on us in our sleep, letting us use the bathroom at night, or allowing us to eat when we were hungry.¬†
* Our abuser‚Äôs youngest sister let us live with her and her kids after we got evicted again and our abuser tried to convince the landlord to kick them out and let him take over the place, so she kicked us out and we ended up having to live in a converted garage. I had to do the laundry and hang dry it because we didn‚Äôt have a dryer anymore. I spent the whole summer isolated with only a box of books the abuser‚Äôs sister gave me, but most of them were romance novels.
* At 13, I was made to babysit the abuser‚Äôs sister‚Äôs 2 and 5 year olds while she worked and the abuser took my money.¬†
* Our abuser went to the Philippines and married a stranger without us and then just moved her in one day. He spent 3,000 dollars, not including what he spent on the plane ticket. I still had a broken front tooth and he could have fixed it, but he bought a wife instead, so he could use her for money from her working, and use her as a servant. While he was gone we stayed with the abuser‚Äôs middle sister and she made us clean her house. (His narcissistic family also exploited us)His new wife was very hard to understand because she spoke broken English. She immediately used me as a detail cleaning service. She threw away me and my brother‚Äôs keepsake box with our old drawings and report cards. Luckily, I had already removed the pictures. I got to go to the dentist because she had dental insurance through her cleaning job, but she only took me for the temporary front tooth appointment and the tooth was only supposed to last a couple weeks, but she never took me back for the permanent crown and I had that funky temporary front tooth for years. I guess she didn‚Äôt think I was worth the money and she had just fixed the embarrassment for her of my chipped front tooth, but didn‚Äôt care about actually helping me.(Years later she told my little sister, her daughter, that she never wanted step kids and resented us)
* Our abuser would say to us, ‚Äúput your shit in black trash bags and get out‚Äù all the time. (We knew we could be made destitute on his whim)
* He made me pay rent before I was 18 and he also stopped buying me things I needed when I got my first job. I used my first paycheck to buy my brother shoes because his were so torn up.¬†
* He took the first car I bought on a family vacation without asking me and it broke down right after the trip and then it sat in the driveway and he never fixed it, even though he knew how to work on cars. (Everything belonged to him)
* When my brother moved out, he discovered that the abuser had put a natural gas bill in his name while he was still a kid and then never paid it, so he had to pay it so he could get his heat turned on.
* He made me go into stores all the time for him. If I got the wrong thing he would scream red faced and rage at me. He even did this when I was 19 over the slightly wrong shade of spray paint.
* I was crying while sitting on our back porch steps when I was 19 because my boyfriend had broken up with me and he saw me and started mocking me saying, ‚Äúboo hoo hoo!‚Äù
* I came home at 1 am one night because I‚Äôd been out with my friends. I was 19 and paid rent, but he gave me one week to get out.
* When I was 25, I lived in the abuser‚Äôs basement when my son was a newborn and the baby‚Äôs father was always leaving us there while he was out cheating on me. My little sister would come down to the basement to hang out with us. Whenever her mom came home and realized my sister was with me, she would scream for her to come back upstairs.¬†
* I left the basement and me and my baby‚Äôs father moved to Troy, Ohio in the same town as my mother. My mother only lived a few miles away, but pretty much ignored us. I moved in with her when my baby‚Äôs father kicked us out and my mother acted mean and annoyed, so I moved back in with my baby‚Äôs father because he was done punishing me for no reason.¬†
* The abuser wouldn‚Äôt let me and my 2 year old son move in after we were abandoned by my son‚Äôs father and he said it was his wife who said we couldn‚Äôt move in. We lived with the abuser‚Äôs youngest sister for one month and then we lived with my brother, but had to sleep on the floor and get bitten by fleas. My baby‚Äôs father never gave us even one dollar. He ended up abandoning his son, moving to Iowa.¬†
* My abuser had me working for below minimum wage for 10 hours a day at his business and wasn‚Äôt actually paying me himself. He made me give teen driving lessons and said I could keep the money from adult driving lessons but if the adults canceled I didn‚Äôt get paid. When I brought this up to him he told my brother that I was ungrateful and he was going to fire me.
* He had me cheat on his taxes and forge state paperwork at the driving school and hide money.
* He used me to take a gift to his old friend at the bar who had blocked him, because he would accept it from a ‚Äúpretty girl‚Äù he said.
* He raged at my little sister and made her cry at the driving school so my brother quit the driving school because of it. I had already quit by this time.
* He screamed at my little sister and threatened to throw a jar of piss at her. He had been going through treatments for cancer, and my sister had refused to answer the door for the pizza delivery driver. He had been peeing in jars so he didn‚Äôt have to get up from the recliner to go to the bathroom.
* He told me the only reason he hadn‚Äôt beaten my little sister was because his wife would have probably stabbed him with a steak knife.¬†
* He wouldn‚Äôt sign the form for my little sister‚Äôs free schooling because he didn‚Äôt want her to be a hairdresser.
* He would always be an asshole to his wife, saying her name all drawn out and weird.
* He made my sister make the holiday meals from a young age.
* He tried to get us to get a pilot‚Äôs license so we could be his private pilot and fly him around whenever he wanted.
* He assumed we would take over the driving school and maintain his ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù, he didn‚Äôt ask us.
* He didn‚Äôt come to my wedding to my current husband and pretended it was because I didn‚Äôt invite him, even though the sister he didn‚Äôt like saw the invite on Facebook too and showed up. His middle sister was supposed to take pictures and she didn‚Äôt show up. My brother tried to pick up my little sister but our abuser wouldn‚Äôt let him. I had a horrible experience and felt full of shame.¬†

* He bragged about his skill at manipulating people.
* He said the neighbor‚Äôs were envious of his yard, though his yard just had some flowers and wasn‚Äôt remarkable.¬†
* He could only act fake nice for short periods of time.
* He said he was disappointed I was never a cheerleader, but he would have never paid for after school stuff or driven me to the practices. I really did want to be a cheerleader and I watched my friend‚Äôs practice all the time.
* His best friend since second grade was discovered to be a pedophile and was sent to prison for the rest of his life for child pornography charges. He was an obvious narcissist, as the abuser only idolized other narcissists.
* He sent Donald Trump 500 dollars two separate times, but never got my kids presents or spent any real time with them or had a bond with them.
* He reiterated over and over all of the horrible things his father had done to him growing up, while seeming completely oblivious to the severity of everything he had done to us.
* If he came to my house with his wife, he would refuse to come inside.¬†

How I think the abuse and neglect affected me, from my journal:

The abuse and neglect caused me to develop Secondary Structural Dissociation (CPTSD), which began when I was 11 years old. My mind split into an apparently normal part, with cut off emotional parts that held the terrorizing memories, which is similar to what happens to war veterans. I could only see the abuse episodes from a third person perspective and they were hollow and without emotion. It was like watching a silent film.

I lived without self-referencing and was solely focused on others' perception of me, because my main goal as an ‚Äúapparently normal part,‚Äù ANP, was to keep myself safe at all times. I never stopped living with the possibility of horrifying abuse on the horizon, even though I was unaware that is what I was doing, because my ANP protected me from the vehement emotions of the terror episodes I had suffered, and allowed me to maintain attachment to my abuser so I could physically survive.

The split off emotional parts of traumatic memories took over when I encountered a trigger and I was sucked into another dimension filled with either deep fear, or intense shame, making all life, even without the abuser‚Äôs presence, feel dangerous, miserable, and hopeless.¬†

Because my abuser didn‚Äôt allow me boundaries, I had no self protection, so bad people were able to manipulate and use me. I also had the misconception that I could finally earn love, which I was desperate for after being starved of it my entire childhood, so I wasn‚Äôt able to recognize the people I was trying to get to love me were bad and that I was chasing an impossible goal.

I couldn‚Äôt imagine my future or make clear decisions, because I had been systematically dehumanized and robbed of the belief that I was a real person, so I never developed my own secure identity. I was forced to stand and listen to the abuser monologue for what felt like endless amounts of time and I had to be a blank wall. I had to minutely control my facial expressions to make sure I didn‚Äôt trigger his wrath. He never took interest in me, or helped me develop, and gaslit me into believing I was worthless and that I had ill intentions.

Whenever I considered protecting myself and leaving an abusive or manipulative significant other, I was overcome with an EP with extreme abandonment anxiety that felt like impending death, so I remained stuck. Being practiced in dissociation, I was able to break off the abuse and neglect and put it out of my mind to continue the relationship, giving just as much time, love and attention as before, thinking that there was something I just wasn‚Äôt getting right, so I just tried harder to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

I was hypervigilant with a dysregulated nervous system and had panic attacks. Major, life altering decisions were controlled by the effects of my abuser‚Äôs cruelty against me, which continued my suffering for many years. Working with the public and under an authority led to me being triggered on a constant basis and I could only hold a job for a year and a half before I had to ‚Äúsave myself.‚Äù I was too terrified to go back to one of the jobs I‚Äôd quit to pick up my last paycheck. Luckily they mailed it to me. I was controlled by my phobias and isolated myself and drank.¬†

I have lived most of my life as an ANP; a dull and lifeless experience of endless chores and no joy, punctuated by EP‚Äôs of doom, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, fear, and shame, when I‚Äôm not on an SSRI medication.

The fragmented parts I‚Äôve been able to identify and the new coping mechanisms I‚Äôm trying to integrate:

EP 1: Scared, unprepared, defenseless part about to be torn apart. Probably 5 years old. Expects no mercy. Will be inside the four walls of hell as screaming, naked bones. (Original Terror)¬†

ANP: Critical, belittling, wants to always appear strong and in control to others. If she‚Äôs not, then she‚Äôll be thrown in the garbage forever. Probably 12 years old and yells at the 5 year old. (Fear of Abandonment/Shame)

Maladaptive Trauma Response: Fawn (Self abandonment)

True Self: I tell my ANP to shut up. If someone wants to throw me in the garbage over stupid shit, then so be it. I‚Äôm going to be honest about what I prefer and go after it. I‚Äôm not going to force my little 5 year old self through her fear unless it‚Äôs for her own good, like going to the dentist. (Self Worth/Assertiveness/Self Protection)

EP 2: Doomed and hopeless. Sees life as completely dangerous. Something bad is around the corner. The judge is out there waiting to measure her up and she‚Äôs always found lacking and worthless. Probably 17 years old. (Trapped Forever with No Solution)

ANP: Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. Live for others. Do her job. Get up. Never relax. Just be on high alert and ready to solve the next problem. Think and figure out any future possible problem. (Fear of Impending Disaster)

Maladaptive Trauma Response: Distract herself. Drink. Suicidal Ideation (Flight)

True Self: This is how bad he made me feel. This is a false perception I had because I was terrorized. This is only temporary and will pass. I‚Äôll do what I can, but I‚Äôm going to take it easy on myself. Sometimes I really and truly feel free. I‚Äôm going to get better and better and have longer lasting times of freedom. (Self Love/Hope)

EP 3: Triggered by husband. Feels shame and is unlovable and worthless and has to please or will be thrown in the garbage. (Shame)

Maladaptive Trauma Response 3: Splits and the outer critic is unleashed and considers leaving. (Fight/Flight)

ANP: She‚Äôll be hopeless and abandoned, so keep pleasing and don‚Äôt outwardly react. Hide her despair and put a smile on her face. (Fear of Abandonment)

True Self: I feel sad and alone and need support. I will go to my¬† husband and tell him the truth and he will comfort me. Or, I will see that his bad mood has nothing to do with me and I will be mature and understanding and keep calm. I‚Äôm not in any danger. My husband is just a human being with emotions. He is never being mean to me. (Cry for Help/Attach/Trust)

EP 4: Oh no. She‚Äôs gone and done it. She‚Äôs pissed someone off by not giving them what they want and now they are trying to shame her. She‚Äôs being attacked. The shame is unbearable! (Severe Shame/Impending Annihilation)¬†

ANP: Give in. Go to someone to try to explain so they tell her she‚Äôs not wrong. Go over everything again and again in her mind to try to convince herself she‚Äôs not wrong. (Fear of Abandonment/Completely Worthless)

Maladaptive Trauma Response 4: She should hide the car. Move out of the city. Change her phone number. (Flight)

True Self: The shame is just a feeling. I‚Äôm not going to let it control my actions. It is just a bogeyman and it will pass. I‚Äôm not going to cave. I am protecting myself from a toxic person who uses me, or is trying to manipulate me and I‚Äôm going to keep protecting myself. (Self Love/Assertiveness/Self Protection)

EP 5: She is nothing but an object. It‚Äôs been proven now that she‚Äôs worthless. She doesn‚Äôt measure up. She‚Äôs all alone and will always be alone. (Abandonment Anxiety/Abandonment Depression/Core Shame)

ANP: Don‚Äôt react, freeze. Think her way out of it. Go on the internet and try to figure it out. She has to pretend she‚Äôs unbothered. She‚Äôs horrible for having such a bad reaction, what is wrong with her?

Maladaptive Trauma Response 5: She doesn‚Äôt measure up. All men are abusers and will eventually treat her like she‚Äôs worthless, she should leave, it‚Äôs hopeless, but then she‚Äôll be alone forever.

True Self: My deepest core wound has been activated. This is how my relationship with my abuser felt. I am projecting my abuser onto my husband. This is a trick my trauma is playing on my mind. I‚Äôll go to my husband for comfort and support and will see yet again that he is the complete opposite of my abuser. I am still connected to him. I am still safe. He still loves me. He does not think I‚Äôm worthless and he doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm just an object. These bad feelings will pass. Nothing has truly changed in my reality, this is just one of the worst EP‚Äôs I have and it‚Äôs not my fault.¬†

Journal entry:

""At 38 years old, my brother was at our abuser‚Äôs house helping him fix a broken sidewalk. My brother accidentally broke the handle off the old concrete mixer. Our abuser, red faced, got into my brother‚Äôs face, screaming, ‚Äúfuck face!‚Äù over and over. I blocked our abuser on Facebook after that. A few months later, he died delusional and alone from heart failure in a nursing home. His wife saw he was out of his mind, but just had him say a prayer to be saved by Jesus, which meant she thought he might die, and then she just left him there.

Dying alone because of the *failure of his heart* was perfect justice.

The other night I felt scared, like I was about to get in trouble, but then I remembered my abuser is nothing more than a pile of ash under a nameless metal plate in the cemetery down the road, and there isn‚Äôt much happening out there except the wind rustling the leaves, the night animals running around, and the sound of crickets.¬†

My life‚Äôs goal was not to become like my abuser and to honor love, of which I have been successful. My new goal is to live life as a whole, integrated person, free of the ANP and EPs, enjoying life in the present moment and not living afraid anymore.""

I was like, okay wierdo. And then my boss called to remind me of the meeting I was 1 minute late to, and we laughed about it.

But honestly, it made me feel really uncomfortable, I always opened doors for people, never heard any complaints, guys, girls, anything in between.

I was honestly a bit hurt, like I did something bad, I just held a door open ffs?!?!

Is it like a feminist thing? Or maybe she doesn't want me to look at her ass or something? She is twice my age, married with two kids, yeah, not looking at her ass can tell you that much. Or maybe I am just repulsive or smell and she doesn't want to get close to me or something?

Hi RL, this is my Housemate's first night on CPAP/APAP. She did a home study through a doctor from a company called SLIIIP and she was dx with an AHI of 5 - very mild on the home study but I know she is a bit worse than what it showed.  She is wearing a Resmed F40 (and has also tried the Solo nasal pillows and will try that tonight). She has not had success trying to get accustomed to CPAP while awake, so she took something to relax her and it helped her actually sleep over 5 hrs with the F40. Awake, she was too anxious and could not go past 10 minutes - and regulate her breathing. Relaxed, she did really well.

  
Her Mom has sleep apnea and she is very petite at 5'1"", 110 lbs. But she started snorning and gasping about 2-3 yrs ago and never wakes up rested, drinks a pot of coffee as a school teacher and can crash standing up (lol).

The doctor had me set her 5-10, EPR of 2. I set her up with a 40 minute ramp and that seemed to help her get to sleep. While awake the pressure was jumping all around because of throat clearing, holding her breath to try to find a rhythm, etc. I'm really impressed with this result for a first night and 5+ hours.",2,1734885714.0,CPAPSupport,6,1.0,False

We‚Äôve found ways to work through them, and overall, we‚Äôve done great! But food remains one of our biggest lifestyle differences.

I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as a chef, but rather as an adult who cooks like an adult. I left my parents‚Äô house at 19, and I had to figure out how to 1) Feed myself without getting fat 2) Not starve to death. Culture probably plays a role too. I‚Äôm European, and she‚Äôs American/Latin-American. For me, eating properly is essential. I can‚Äôt get through my day, or life in general, without 3 meals a day: varied, balanced, with a good cup of coffee and a touch of indulgence.

For example, here‚Äôs what I cooked recently: **Breakfast**: Eggs and bacon, muesli, a grapefruit, and coffee. **Lunch**: Starter: tomato and feta salad. Main: steamed vegetables, marinated fish, rice, and beans. Dessert: yogurt. **Dinner**: A wannabe Thai-style fried rice (with leftovers from lunch and two eggs) and a fruit salad for dessert.

Her relationship with food, on the other hand, is pure chaos.

When we met, she couldn‚Äôt cook anything beyond frozen fish and potatoes. She starts a new diet every two months but never sticks to it. She avoids fruit because of the sugar, yet she‚Äôs totally fine ordering McDonald‚Äôs the next day. Meal times? Totally irregular: she‚Äôll skip breakfast, eat lunch at 3 PM, or snack on random things late at night.

She also has weight insecurities. She used to be thin and svelte in her younger years, but after getting an office job and aging (as we all do), she gained some weight, which she struggles to accept. I‚Äôm fine with it, and I support her as long as she‚Äôs trying to address it.

To her credit, she‚Äôs been going to CrossFit regularly, even waking up at 5 AM to train. I respect that effort so much.

However, her approach to food still frustrates me:

1. She frequently complains about her weight and body shape.
2. She barely participates in food-related chores like cooking, meal planning, or grocery shopping. If I‚Äôm too tired to cook after work, we often end up ordering unhealthy food on Uber Eats.

What I‚Äôve tried so far:

* I encouraged her to see a nutritionist. She went to a couple of sessions, got a custom diet plan, and pinned it to the fridge. It‚Äôs still there‚Ä¶ but she‚Äôs never followed it.
* I‚Äôve explained the basics of eating properly multiple times: 3 meals a day, at reasonable times, with a balanced diet and minimal junk food. I‚Äôve even compared it to basic hygiene‚Äîlike showering daily.

But nothing has worked.

Tonight she skipped dinner (again), woke up in the middle of the night, and raided the kitchen to make‚Ä¶ beans and mayonnaise in front of the TV. I felt so angry and disgusted. Earlier that same day, I had thrown a dozen bags of Cheetos into the trash.

One thing that I always loved to do was hop on the subway and just walk around and explore different neighbourhoods. Just walking around looking at the architecture, finding interesting shops and coffee spots.

Not long after I moved to the city, I got into a relationship. We broke up at the beginning of December, because we had a myriad of problems. One of the things about that relationship is that she really didn't like spending time in the city. We would always have to drive to a place outside the city. Mostly to a place for a hike/nature walk. Now, I love getting out into nature and going for hikes. But I don't want to do that every weekend.

I work from home, so I don't even get out of the house to go to work. This weekend I was excited because I finally had a weekend to myself. Yesterday I was going to go out and explore the city. However, I just kept putting it off for some reason. I only went out to the laundromat, and to do some grocery shopping. Both of which are a five minute walk away.

I want to get out and explore the city that I haven't really done anything in for the last two and half years. Today is another nice day with sunshine, but I actually woke up this morning with anxiety about leaving the house. It's like I have two sides of my mind fighting each other. I want to go out, but I'm so nervous to do so. I don't really know what to do.",1,1734884768.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

The heating elements on coffee sensors (I'm in Europe) say that they are all for postmill modells but they could be adapted to the old style I can't find the adapter though. Will they send pieces automatically?

Also could there be other problems causing the heating issue like the pressure sensor that controls heating with Professionals?

I've long been taking 2 tablespoons of Metamucil daily and in the morning. This has made me super regular--I poop once in the morning unless I have more than one cup of coffee. Additionally, when I poop, cleanup is super easy and almost to the point of asking ""did I even poop?"" That's what I LOVE about Metamucil--I don't have to worry about wiping and wiping and wiping, especially if I find myself need to use a public restroom.

That has all been good and fine.

I started taking Wellbutrin (bupropion XR 150mg) for depression on November 30. Since that time, I no longer have my miracle poops like I described above. It's a mess, despite taking the Metamucil. We're talking easily five to six wipes with TP and then two to three wipes with a baby wipe. I hate it and want my miracle poops back.

So, my question is: have any of you encountered the same thing (taking Wellbutrin and Metamucil (or any psyllium husk)) and have you found a way to get your miracle poops back?",0,1734884628.0,AskGaybrosOver30,7,0.5,False

This year was full of a LOT of life changes, so I thought it would be interesting to track my full year of spending. I track my monthly budget, but have never done a full year in review.

I started the year making $50k and living with three roommates in Pittsburgh. I'm ending the year making $73k and living with my girlfriend in Baltimore (and driving a new car).

Full details down below, but the TLDR:

* My biggest expense was buying a 2018 Honda Civic with 34k miles. I saved up $20k to put down a hefty down payment. With the car included, I am at a loss of -$16,331.15. Excluding the car purchase, I ended the year with a net $4,370.50. 
   * Despite this huge expense, my net worth basically stayed exactly the same thanks to my pre-tax retirement contributions.
* I'm overall content with my spending, especially how much I spent on travel and hobbies. Writing everything down reminded me of the amazing memories of following my favorite band on tour,  climbing in Lake Tahoe, and more. No regrets there.
* In 2025 I want to donate at *least* 1% of my income. I'm ashamed of how little I donated, especially because I literally work in the nonprofit world! I know how much organizations depend on individual donors.
* In January I debated for WEEKS about whether or not to buy a $197 parka. And honestly, it was probably one of my best purchases of the year. I'd go back in time and buy that parka sooner.

*NOTE: This only tracks my net income. This does not include taxes or my 403(b) retirement contribution/employer match.*

1hk1r2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1hk1r2w/ps5_bugs_anyone_else_may_contain_16_spoilers/,PS5 Bugs? Anyone else? May contain 1.6 spoilers. ,"I‚Äôve been playing the 1.6 on the PS5 for about two weeks now. I‚Äôve noticed a couple bugs that I‚Äôve seen other people discuss generally speaking, but there‚Äôs a few others I think I‚Äôve noticed and just wanted confirmation if anyone else has experienced this and it‚Äôs not a me issue (or maybe something I missed when combing through current console bugs). For context, I have played on the switch for years so I‚Äôm used to console play, but I just got the ps5 and have only really been playing 1.6 on there so unclear if it‚Äôs showing up on the switch or not.  

1. Music will just randomly cut out. Example: I woke up and the standard seasonal music is playing. I go outside and Robin was working on the farmhouse. As soon as the hammer sound goes off(specifically the *clink* sound), the music immediately cuts out. I leave the farm, music starts again, I go back the farm, and as soon as the *clink* sound goes off again the music cuts out. Have also had this happen when farm animals make sounds. Just had it happen again with me waking up and opening up the fridge to put coffee away. Music just cuts out with the sound of the fridge going off and won‚Äôt come back on until I leave the farm. 
2. Running or walking around the map and will randomly get a very loud sound from whatever terrain I‚Äôm walking on. Example: I was mining and running around the levels, out of nowhere I hear this super loud thud sound like I stepped on something (I was not hitting rocks). This has also happened to me when I‚Äôm out on the beach or out walking around on the farm. 
3. Animals not spawning items for months. Not sure if this is a bug or not. I‚Äôve just never had it happen to me. I bought a duck spring 1 year 1, I didn‚Äôt get a duck feather until year 2 - all full hearts. Same with rabbits and rabbit foot. Bought them in year 1, didn‚Äôt see any rabbit feet until mid year 2 - all full hearts. 
4. I cannot put wallpaper in hallways in the farmhouse. Doesn‚Äôt work no matter how I try to put them up. 
5. Horse runs through walls. Example: I was riding the horse back to the stable trying to book it into my house before 2:00. I jumped off as I approached the stable, the horse disappeared. Scared the sh*t out of me. I ran around and realized it was behind the stable so it somehow broke past the wall. Had happened with fences too. Fences don‚Äôt break but somehow my horse is now stuck behind it and I can‚Äôt get it out without chopping down the fence. 

These are all fairly minor, so it‚Äôs not anything like game play shattering. They‚Äôre just so weird and I couldn‚Äôt find anything about them when I was looking it up so I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs a ps5 thing, a save file thing, or if you guys are having similar bugs pop up across other mediums?

1hk1pzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1hk1pzx/overplanning_every_moment_in_my_head/,Over-planning every moment in my head ,"I'm posting this here because I think it is related to my anxiety and need for control. I plan everything in my head. When I wake up I will plan my day , like making a list of things that I will do, and in what order. This can be really detailed, for e.g: Get up, brush teeth, have coffee, take meds, shower, get breakfast, watch youtube video, clean room, etc. etc. for the whole day. It really brings me peace and allows me to make sure i have something ""to look forward to"". I realised that although this brings me a lot of peace and comfort, if i am with other people or there are unpredictable factors, I am just constantly faced with the feeling of plans being spoiled. So i tend to get stressed out and tense about things (going wrong) that seem incosequential to others, but to me it ties into a whole elaborate plan i had in my head. 

for example this morning i woke up long before my boyfriend as usual and had planned that id wake him up at about 10:30, and I wanted to pack my bag and go home and shower and go to a market by 12pm. I got snappy because my boyfriend kept trying to pull me onto the bed or tickle me or whatever while i was getting ready, so i only left his place at like 11:30. He said i acted like he was wasting my time because i just wanted to get on with my plans (poor boy haha, i apologised). He doesnt understand why im so rushed if i have zero time constraints, and i didnt know how to explain how much i didnt like my ""plan"" being thrown off. This gets 10x worse if im feeling overwhelmed or stressed.

Does anyone else think ahead like this constantly? Is it something i can work on, and how? I dont want to be so inflexible and uptight but i feel so overwhelmed and/or aimless without these plans. i am also extremly indecisive so thinking ahead means i am only faced with decision-making tasks once instead of between each activity. Also if there is any helpful research or ideas related to this that i can look up that would also be helpful!",1,1734884382.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False
