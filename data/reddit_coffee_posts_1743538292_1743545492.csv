I took the bus tour but I‚Äôd also like to hear from current students too.

Here‚Äôs some of my more pressing questions (from greatest to least):

1. Time management. It‚Äôs a skill I sorta struggle with and I‚Äôd like to know how hard it was to get used to things like the bus schedule. (Also, tips to get used to it would be appreciated).

2. What about Job culture? Are there a good amount of jobs for students to make money? Internships to build my experience.

3. How‚Äôs the holidays handled? Are there Halloween events? Christmas events? School specific events? Etc.

4. How‚Äôs the Nerd culture? As a huge tabletop dork, I‚Äôd love to know how the tabletop scene is. Are there MTG tournaments? DND nights? Etc.

5. How‚Äôs the restaurant culture? Are there cookie shops? Coffee shops? Etc?

6. This one‚Äôs a bit embarrassing to ask but how about furry culture (take a wild guess what my major is)? Is it lively? I remember seeing a club called rutfurs when looking things up so I‚Äôd really like to know if it‚Äôs still active.

I have a few more but they‚Äôre not really that pressing. I really wanna know what the social life is as this is the first time I‚Äôm gonna live on campus and away from my family. I would really like to know what the average student life is like as this will be an entirely new experience to me and I want to make the most out of my time.

1jp87us,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jp87us,For the Buttercream/Milky Cake fiends.....,"This new one from September, 'Red Velvet Cake' is right down your alley.

From farmer Edwin Nore√±a, this is an experimental honey co-ferment caturra and it's one of the funkiest coffees I've had.

Beans are gnarly (see second shot) but that's expected.

I dialled it in over all three brew methods and it holds up super well to filter, espresso and milk.

As filter it tastes like chocolate covered freeze dried strawberries.
As espresso it's about the biggest coffee I've had in a while, with a ton of raspberry acidity, the cinnamon coming through along with a blood orange finish.

In milk (see third shot, and apologies for the crappy latte art, it was a rush job before work) it's very reminiscent of Buttercream/Milky Cake, with the cinnamon and cardomom coming through strong in milk.

Mine is only 6 days post roast (remarkable how quick they can get it to Australia) so I imagine it'll open up even more over the next week.

Not for everyone, granted, but if you're a fan of those heavy ferment spiced coffees, Red Velvet Cake is worth a crack.

1jp85qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1jp85qe/no_one_warned_me_how_insanely_social_the_mba/,"No one warned me how insanely social the MBA experience is, and I'm totally overwhelmed","As an international female student who‚Äôs more on the nerdy and introverted side, no one warned me how insanely social the MBA experience would be. It‚Äôs unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced, even more intense than high school.

When I applied, I thought the MBA would be a balance of academics, recruiting, networking, and some socializing. I imagined things would be evenly split, with socializing mostly happening over one-on-one coffee chats or the occasional happy hour. Instead, what I‚Äôve experienced has been completely different.

Now that we‚Äôre nearing the end of our first year, most people have checked out of academics. At the beginning, people took classes seriously, but once they realized the grading curve is generous and grades don‚Äôt really matter because of grade non-disclosure, they stopped caring. The focus shifted to recruiting, with everyone doing interview prep, case prep, and all that. But after recruiting wrapped up, the entire energy shifted toward one thing: having fun.

I am not exaggerating when I say that the thing people care about most right now isn‚Äôt school or career networking. It‚Äôs about what the next party is and what costumes they are going to wear. People go all out with elaborate themes like 90s parties, Great Gatsby nights, and Mardi Gras masquerades. It‚Äôs not casual either. People size each other up based on how cool or creative their costumes are. That is basically the social currency here.

These parties usually involve heavy drinking. There is a lot of binge drinking, shots, and sometimes hard drugs. Outside of the parties, there is also a big focus on fun extracurriculars. Ski culture is massive, and people use it as a way to socialize. Many classmates also organize bike rides, hikes, or sign up for local half marathons together. There are weekend camping trips, bar hopping weekends in other cities, and both domestic and international trips that are more about partying than anything else. One of the biggest social events is Yacht Week in Croatia, which is basically a week-long party on boats where people drink heavily and live like they are in an episode of The White Lotus.

When I first heard about these international treks, I thought they would be focused on learning about business culture in other countries, connecting with startups, or building professional networks. That has not been my experience. It is entirely about partying and having fun.

The social scene here honestly reminds me of American high school. There are cliques, there is constant gossip, and people hook up or date all the time. I have seen so many people throw up from drinking, even in Ubers on the way home.

Everyone seems to be Type A and extremely extroverted. Even the more nerdy people are still highly social. They might prefer board game nights or movie marathons, but it is still very social and constant.

For me, it has been exhausting. I used to think I was fairly social, but this experience has made me realize I have limits. I eventually moved out of a shared living situation because I felt socially overstimulated all the time. I needed my own space to decompress, to read, or to watch TV without anyone around. Yes, these events are technically optional, but there is immense social pressure to attend them. 

I knew the MBA experience would be social and a bit of a party, but I thought people would still care about learning or professional connection. That has not been the case so far. It has been non-stop socializing, and I honestly did not sign up for this. Sometimes I wonder if I should have gone to a program like Darden that has more of an academic focus.

I know I am not the only one who feels this way. There is a section in Susan Cain‚Äôs book¬†Quiet¬†where she talks about an introverted HBS student who described the experience as hell because of how much social energy it demanded.

If anyone has advice on how to manage this and protect my peace while still being part of the community, I would love to hear it. Thanks. I'm going into a product internship at a tech company for the summer, so I hope that's a better cultural fit.",11,1743544813.0,MBA,2,0.92,False

1jp846a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jp846a/is_dating_this_difficult_everywhere_these_days/,Is Dating This Difficult Everywhere These Days?,"Hi everyone.

I was in a 9 year relationship until me and my ex separated 2 years ago. We're divorced now.

So I hadn't dated for quite a long time or aimed to build relationships with women I know in hopes of romance blossoming for a long time too and wasn't aware just how much things have changed in that time!

It seems today, women just want to be friends and cringe the moment you suggest you'd like to get to know them more intimately, or mention the word 'date'. I know plenty of single women who are somewhat attractive physically but just not interested in dating. Women in Scotland seem to be of the mindset they no longer need men, from what I have learned from conversations with the women I know. 

A friend of mine said he always found approaching random attractive women to be the best, particularly in places like shopping centres, libraries or coffee shops. So, for two days over the weekend I decided, at 33yo, I was going to do just that. I just walked up, said hi and immediately made it clear I thought she looked great, had awesome style, that sort of thing. 

However, every single woman acted disgusted! My friend who advised this was always successful for him came along so I wasn't just some solo dude approaching random women all day üòÇ But he was surprised by their reactions! One girl even said ""who tf do you think you are and what gives you the right to just walk up to me when I'm trying to live my life"" or something along those lines. Like pretty girls who seemed really nice turned aggressive, dismissive and even argumentative the moment I said ""I thought you looked great and just wanted to say hi""... A polit no would have been enough but literally every woman took it to the extreme. I was even told numerous times to use dating apps if I'm single like a 'normal' person... Thing is, we all know dating apps rarely work for men.

What's even more awkward is that I'm actually a good looking and confident guy. I gym it 4 days per week as well and have done since I was 16yo. I know looks aren't the be all, end all, especially for women. But I always make people smile and laugh, all my mates think I'm a really ""chill and cool guy"" < their words, not mine lol And so I just talk to women in a similar way but if I find a woman attractive I tend to make it quite clear I'd like to get to know her and that's when they'll usually pump the breaks. 

Another thing I have been told in general conversations with girls I got friendly with at the gym was that the fact I have a 4yo daughter, was married before and also make under ¬£50K makes me extremely undesirable, no matter how good I look. They also said NEVER approach a woman in the gym, which I never have nor ever will. 

The issue is, I don't drink and also don't think high value women hang around in bars or clubs, so I never go to those places. There's literally nothing around here for singles to meet like clubs or whatever and it seems most women are just not interested in dating men, from what I can tell... I tried two shopping centres, one in Edinburgh (also hit the main street which was busy af and still didn't get me a single woman's number) and one in Glasgow. Tried multiple different coffee shops, libraries and the result was always the same. Lots of single ladies and not one of them willing to give me more than a few words, let alone her number! Also, I don't do Insta or that, turns out that's a RED FLAG according to a few women I spoke to over the weekend.

All in all, I must have approached around 200 girls over two days and was getting pretty smooth with the words and getting laughs and even had a few blushing, saying they thought I was hot and all, but still refused to give me anything and just said they weren't looking to date or just straight up don't need a man. 

Never felt so reflected in my life üòÇ

So, is it like this everywhere now? Scotoand was always a tough place to date. But holy hell has it changed drastically in 10 years. At this point I'm just not really sure what else to do to meet single like-minded ladies who are actually attractive and looking to date. Do women like this exist who aren't already taken and, if so, where!? ",2,1743544704.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I'd be curious to hear about some of your favorites and least favorites?

I feel like The Teahouse is a popular one, but the study area is always very cold and it's not super comfortable. However the vibes are great since everyone's studying and the energy is good. Definitely gives study hall vibes.

For places that are comfortable and not crowded, Gong Cha and The Alley boba tea shops are great. I also like Teaspresso but the seating isn't very comfortable. These three have great drinks too. Gong Cha has nice booth seating, and Alley has really comfortable seats. You'll always get space to work are these places. 

The best of both words for me is Kohiko. Excellent vibes, drinks, service, and decor.  
Behind that I love Rang coffee and Haraz coffee house.

Fellowship coffee is also a decent one, but seating is limited and the seating isn't that comfortable and most tables except the long one in the middle are small.

Blendin coffee is a classic, but they're often quite busy and it's hit or miss if you'll get seating. And the seats are pretty average. 

Minuti has incredible coffee but limited in wifi time, has decent vibes, but seating is average as well.

Would love to hear some of your favs and thoughts!",0,1743544693.0,sugarland,0,0.5,False

So I‚Äôm out of country rn for trip with family . There is 2hr + time difference and I‚Äôve poor network here so messages are delayed and we aren‚Äôt able to vid call / audio call due to privacy and network issues . 

For some more context she used to talk to many random guys online but after coming into relationship she herself stopped that without ever pointing out which is truly remarkable change I appreciate her I‚Äôm glad she did it herself but today she was texting a random senior she don‚Äôt even know . So I came online while she was talking to that guy in insta but she still continued chatting with him . Yeah I‚Äôll agree my internet was slow so messages were delayed ( 10-40 sec ) , video / audio weren‚Äôt clear on call but I‚Äôm shocked that she was chatting with him simultaneously almost whole time literally even when we were arguing when I taunted her on this thing . 

She said she had opened the my chat waiting for messages but replying him from notifications. Yeah I got angry as today I rushed from the place to come to hotel and have a chat with her but she did this but later on things ended on good note but now I‚Äôm feeling disappointed. 

If she says I‚Äôm no priority then why she were continuously talking to that guy , can‚Äôt she wait for my message as I‚Äôve genuine issue.  

Also for the chatting it wasn‚Äôt much special he was trying to talk to her by roasting himself, she was just roasting her while staying respectful to him . She asked some study related questions ( little bit ). Also that guy asked for coffee but she turned it down and he complimented her also flirted ( I really hate it when someone flirts with her but she can‚Äôt control what other person will say) but she just stayed playful so that she won‚Äôt disrespect him. 

But this isn‚Äôt my disrespect? Like I literally came to hotel earlier just to talk to her and she is talking to someone else whole time . I feel like shit ngl . Like I don‚Äôt think basic things should be asked like please talk to me and not to someone else we are grown up we know what to do .

I've just ordered a small solar panel set that I'm going to make myself learn to use, as it's something that I find intimidating for some reason. It's labeled as enough to run/charge things with a usb connection, so it's not really big. Is there anything I could get to help warm food that runs with a usb or usb-c cable? Ideally, I'd like to be able to heat up water for coffee, ramen, or veggies. Nothing too extreme. I have a mug warmer that I haven't tried yet that I think might work, but I'm curious if there are other options that run on small amounts of power. 

I do have a barbecue and little camp stove too, but I like the idea of solar power because I don't need to stock up on fuel. 

Any tips or knowledge to share on solar power is welcome. ",1,1743544485.0,TwoXPreppers,1,1.0,False

The only things I do for fun are text roleplaying, sleeping, drinking coffee, and smoking regular cigarettes. All the money that doesn't go for it goes to my parents.

I don't see a problem in it. Most of the ambitions I had in life are dead- I live just for the pleasure of being left alone with my writing. But my mother sees a problem in it. Every time she passes through my bedroom door, she asks if I'm working; Monday morning? ""Are you working?"" Wednesday afternoon? ""Are you working?"" Fucking SATURDAY NIGHT?!! Same shit. I can't take a nap in the afternoon where I'm not reminded that I have two elderly people to support. When she was my age she went out to party every night, and filled me with shame for coming back home with a different man every night- she excuses that saying that she never let me and my brother go without, but she and my stepfather are not going without either. She complained last Friday that she had no money; I sneaked out her phone and saw her balance, she had 200 bucks and I would get paid on Monday. That was more than enough to spend the weekend, but she wanted to throw a barbeque jut because.

1jp7ybp,https://www.reddit.com/r/boba/comments/1jp7ybp/props_to_boba_tea_protein_unsponsored/,Props to Boba Tea Protein (unsponsored),"I want to make an appreciation post for Boba Tea Protein. I am not in any way sponsored. I simply want to support a rising business that deserves to be successful.

I have lactose intolerance, so most normal protein powders makes me feel sick. I have also tried plant-based proteins (including the pea protein stuff), and while I don't get sick from those, they usually taste terrible. Whenever I try to drink bad-tasting proteins, I tend to break the habit in a few days as drinking them felt like chores.

So, that's when Boba Tea Protein came in. A few months ago, one of my friends randomly recommend it to me. I know her to be extremely picky when it comes to food and drink, so when she says she likes something, it's a big endorsement. So, I ordered one bag of classic flavor to try. I was amazed - I never thought I could come across a boba tea that checks so many boxes for me:

\- Actually taste good  
\- No refined sugar  
\- Lactose free (sometimes 99% free depending on the particular batch)

I have been going to the gym 4 times a week for a few years. But, I recently got a lot of compliments from friends and my partner about my significant muscle growth in a short amount of time. I credit this improvement to Boba Tea Protein as it allows me to effortlessly build a protein-drinking habit. When something taste good, you look forward to consuming it. Looking forward to an activity comparing to seeing it as a chore makes a massive difference in habit building.

I've ordered my 7th bag as of today - making these shakes never got old. I've made these shakes for my gym friends, and every one of them were dumbfounded by how good and natural-tasting these are. I'd actually prefer the Matcha Latte flavor over actual matcha lattes that cost $10 in coffee shops - it's *that* good.

\---

I recently made an order for 3 different flavors as well as a shaking bottle. When I received the package, I notice one flavor along with the shaking bottle was missing. I noticed signs of tampering: the sealing tape had been ripped open and re-taped with duct tape, and the shipping label indicated the package originally weighed 2.5 pounds more. Clearly, something had been stolen during transit.

I emailed Boba Tea Protein about this issue. At first I was afraid they would play the ping-pong game by shifting the liability to the courier and call it a day like a lot of businesses do. However, they sent me a replacement package in half an hour, no question asked. I was amazed by this gesture, so I feel I should return the favor and give them a free publicity post.

Props to Boba Tea Protein for running a superb business. Looking forward to many more future orders from you guys.",1,1743544285.0,boba,1,1.0,False

Some elderly lady from out town had unfortunate turn of events with her health situation so she had to get surgery. But before she left she asked my vet friend to take care of the cat untill she gets back.

Bad news is that it looks like it wont be so soon untill that old lady can take the cat back (or how able will she be to properly take care of it) so her family suggested that if the vet (my friend) can find a trustworthy person then she should ask for cat to be adopted. 

Today i went to meet the cat and i played with her while i had the cup of coffee with vet and her husband.  Cat is 12 and she was the sweetest angel you can imagine. This cat was her client since day old lady got her as a kitten and she did everything medical for the cat from the day 1 so she knows her full history... Vacinated, spayed, regularly checked, everything.

But still my family is against it. They think that cat will die soon since she is 12 and they dont want to get heartbroken. Truthfully, i am worried about that too but i also want to do everything i can for that kitty. There are kids in vet's home where she is staying now and i dont know how elderly cats handle ruckus.

Also my family is worried about our two cats at home and how they will accept new one.

I dont know what to do...

Bad habits: hookah (quit sept 2024 after 17 yrs). Eat and sleep (spicy). Eat dinner and nap. Tight clothes. Drink coffee (medium roast. Recently switch to dark roast and cut dose to less than half)

Ive had LPR (throat clearing) for over 2 years by now. I dont recall having heartburn at all though until i tried nexium earlier this year. Got rebound for 4 days then it was ok for a total of 2 weeks. The doctor advised 4-6 weeks. On day 18 i got extremely dizzy, cognitively disabled and ended up throwing up after lunch so i stopped it abruptly. Had terrible heartburn thereafter for 2 weeks more or less. Doctor prescribed tecta. I refused to take any medication during this period.

Fast forward my throat clearing was back and worse. It was affecting my voice and i had heartburn every now and then. I lost 20 pounds due to dietary changes. During this period i ate mostly alkaline food no spicy and 3h before bed. Slept hungry a lot of times. Visceral fat was deleted within a week (72kg to 62kg)

I had to give pepcid a try. I decided to go with regular strength (10mg) I took half a pill in the morning and half at night for a few days. I started getting frequent heartburn so i thought it might be the dosage and me breaking the pill which inread has to do with absorption. Now on 1 pills before breakfast, one before dinner (12h spaced)

The heartburn is almost consistent throughout the day even if i wake up in the morning and drink water i start getting heartburn immediately. However my throat clearing is almost completely healed. General feeling of unwellness in my intestines/abdominal. 

Additional info: 

Otolaryngology (2024): performed a rhinoscopy. Only mentioned my vocal cords were red and swollen. (Not discussed at this time but obvious LPR symptoms i guess?)

Endoscopy: negative. No hiatal hernia. Didnt find anything just mentioned my esophagus reacted sensitively so he performed a biopsy. No signs of acid reflux in the esophagus.

ER: during nexium rebound i had a breakdown and decided to check in ER. All my blood/urine tests came back very good (negative).
Ct Scan: no finds. No hiatal hernia
Ultra Sound: no finds. No hiatal hernia

H Pylori breath test: negative

Post nasal drip: tried nasal spray with 0 benefits.

Alkaline water: for 2 days i exclusively drank alkaline water 7.7+ and my throat symptoms were cleared 95% but my bowel was fluffy and so much softer and looked like what i suspect undigested food bits. So i decided to stop.

Im going nuts. The doctors only want to put me on medication which made me worse.. im not willing to be on ppis bcuz of my experience with nexium. Not sure how to proceed from here in understanding whats happening. Ive ordered align probiotics 24/7, mangesium bisglycinate and sodium alginate. I plan to taper out pepcid if i dont see improvements in the next week. I have heartburn regardless anyway.. or perhaps switch to maximum strength pepcid.. unsure.. ",0,1743544038.0,GERD,1,0.5,False

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Green Electric Kettle

Before diving into specific models,let's explore the essential features to consider when selecting your *green electric kettle*:

*   **Material:** Kettles are typically made from stainless steel,glass,or plastic. Stainless steel is durable and doesn't leach chemicals into the water. glass allows you to see the water level and boiling process. plastic kettles are often the most affordable but ensure they are *BPA free green electric kettle* options.
*   **Capacity:** Consider how much water you typically boil at once. Smaller kettles (around 1 liter) are ideal for individuals or small households, while larger kettles (1.5 liters or more) are better for families or frequent entertaining. A *small green electric kettle* can be a great space-saver for small kitchens.

*   **Safety Features:** Automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection are essential safety features to prevent accidents.
*   **Spout Design:** A well-designed spout is crucial for preventing spills and drips.*Green gooseneck kettle* spouts are particularly popular for pour-over coffee, offering precise water flow control.
*   **Ease of Cleaning:** Look for a kettle with a wide opening for easy cleaning. some kettles also have removable filters to prevent limescale buildup.

I have been dating this girl for going on two months, and this past week everything has changed. She has still done 90% of the pursuing.

We are both gay women, but she has a problem with me speaking even casually to people of both genders. Waitresses, cracking jokes, being just nice to humans we meet in public. She doesn't like it. I saw a friend on campus, and she got upset I spoke to him for like five minutes. She said ""you could've just said hey and kept walking.""

Today, she called me and had me meet her on campus so we could walk back to her place after and get my things (I stayed over last night at her suggestion, date for Friday). We went ti grab coffee and I was being nice and joked with the waitress (she had the same name as the girl this post is about). She was rude to both me and the waitress and said I was too friendly. I told her she was rude.

She said she doesn't have to be nice, and that she doesn't owe the world. II changed the subject and said , ""interesting I tend to attract introverted women.."" and she said ""I am sure you can find introverted women in the business building (random place on campus)."" I think she was joking but I said, ""nah, I'm good here."" But this whole exchange was annoying. 

I'm unsure in general though how to tell if she is easy to get along with or has just had bad days. She still does all the pursuing in the relationship and wants to see me constantly, even with dates set in the future. When she is moody, I just joke about it or ignore her but it's becoming annoying.

We went on a mini road trip and she woke up grouchy. She said she was just hungry when we talked about it. I jokingly said she may have hypoglycemia (hint that she needs to be accountable) and she said ""i don't think so, I've been like this since I have a child."" I told her she should get it checked and she said no.

I have been using a salicylic acid acne wash 2-3 times a week for the past 4 months.

Cerave or just water in the mornings and at night for the past year.

Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Facial Moisturizer daily for the past 4 months.

I am not always consistent with my routine. Two or three nights a week, I fall asleep without washing my face.

Over the past few years, my face has flared up like this for a week or two and returned to normal. It's never entirely free of redness, though. I've tried Eucerin eczema relief cream and Aquafor without relief during my flare-ups. A gentle lotion will burn after a shower during a flare-up.

Something to note, I am on two immunosuppressants and prednisone for a kidney transplant. I drink 1-2 cups of coffee daily and 3-4 liters of water.

Survivor of childhood abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual). For many years I thought I was the only one who experienced it. I am the eldest, the only girl, and the only stepchild. Abuser was my stepdad. Sexual abuse took place from the ages of 4-8, basically until I was old enough to understand, and I threatened to tell.

I recently got new knowledge that one of my brothers experienced the sexual abuse as well. I also learned that he's still displaying violence toward my mother like he used to (threw a chair across the room and broke a coffee maker). He used to be on the police force and the fire department.

I have renewed anger and feel like I want to expose him. He's apparently sleeping with someone as well as hitting on teenage girls and I just feel like... people need to know.
I am worried that if I expose him, he will become violent toward my mother and possibly also my brother(s). My brother would likely respond in kind and end up in jail in that scenario. 

My mother intends to divorce him after my youngest brother is settled in college, but I don't know if I can sit on this for 6 more months. Now that I know for certain it wasn't just me, I am wondering how many children were affected.

I am considering making an anonymous post in a local group meant to warn women, but I have no idea what will happen if I do so.

I know YachtRock has strong fans, but why couldn't they stay on Channel 17? Oh wait, we have Alex Cooper's ""Unwell Radio"" taking CoffeeHouse's spot on ch. 3 because the Gen Z ""icon"" whose degrading and sexist rhetoric masquerading as empowerment ALSO deserves a payola channel.   

I know SiriusXM has been caving into these atrocious artist specific channels for years now, but I am genuinely surprised that a fairly new, and *conventionally attractive* channel would be cast away so soon.

For context, I have a 7 month old kitten named Rosie whose chin has been continuously collecting some sort of coffee ground substance since we‚Äôve had her at two months old. I‚Äôm cleaning her chin every day with pet antiseptic wipes. At first I thought it was from food, because she‚Äôs an absolutely crazy little ravenous gremlin baby, but it just keeps happening and appears to be something more. She eats both wet and dry food, is indoor only, no flees. I‚Äôve done all the research in the world and it wouldn‚Äôt be mites. She‚Äôs got white fur on her chin so it‚Äôs easy to see that it‚Äôs kind of attached to the fur itself and not her skin. Alternatively, still unsure this comes from acne as my other adult cat will get a black head here or there. They drink from a metal fountain, though the spout is plastic. They both have those fancy auto feeders that open only to their collar tag because they eat each other‚Äôs food otherwise. Adult cat started to put on pounds and the kitten just ate everything all the time, so that‚Äôs why the fancy feeders- BUT‚Ä¶ the tray in the feeders are metal, though the outer parts are all plastic. Basically, even if I changed the fountain, there would still be plastic in her life due to the feeder. I hear plastic is the acne culprit if this is what both cats are experiencing in different ways. I‚Äôm consulting Reddit here as I don‚Äôt want to go all the way to the vet and pay money for them to tell me it‚Äôs cat acne from plastic.

1jp77zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1jp77zg/do_you_prefer_it_want_it_or_need_it_my_take_on/,"Do you prefer it, want it or need it? My take on detaching from our desires.","(In this post, I'm talking only about the concept of detachment in regard to your desired reality, not the ideas of detaching from the old story or detaching from the 3d, though they are all connected.)

Let it go. Release it. Detach. Some very successful teachers claim you don't need to detach at all, others say it's an essential part of deliberate manifestation.

I think both are somewhat right, but before I get into why, I would just like to remind you, that this is my opinion, based on my knowledge, understanding and experience. If something I say stresses you out, offends you or simply does not resonate, just leave it. You know best what's best for you.

Let's get into it.

# Do I have to stop wanting my desired outcome?

*No.* That much is obvious. We have all read plenty of success stories of people being obsessed with getting what they want, even being desperate, 'affirming through the tears' and *still* getting exactly what they were asking for.

The more I learn about different people's experiences, the more I realize: There are no obligations. So far, I have not found a single 'rule' regarding conscious manifestation that does not have exceptions. Which makes sense; it's the law of *assumption*, after all. Which means if you decide with conviction that something doesn't apply to you, it simply won't.

# Do I have to stop needing my desired outcome?

Well, this one, while still technically a no, is a bit more complex. I would argue that you don't have to, but when you realize you don't need it, your life will get so much easier.

As I just explained, I don't really believe in 'have to' when it comes to manifesting. Still, I think most of us will benefit from this shift in perspective as *detachment seems to be the common denominator* in every 'effortless' manifestation story. Most of the time when people receive things super quickly and easily, *they didn't really care* whether it happened or not.

I look at detachment as a spectrum; looking something like this:

**ATTACHMENT**

* SURVIVAL NEED
* EMOTIONAL NEED
* WANT
* PREFERENCE
* INDIFFERENCE

**DETACHMENT**

**Survival needs** are pretty straight forward: food, water, shelter, physical safety. Life and death type stuff. When you look at your desire as a survival need, there is a belief that if you don't get this thing, you will (or might) die.

**Emotional needs** actually *feel* like survival needs, and one could argue that, in some way, they are. I still chose to list them separately because, when unmet, they pose a less immediate threat to survival than unmet physical needs.

**Want vs. preference** can be a subtle, yet powerful difference. Preference is a feeling of light desire, like 'I would like a cup of coffee right now, but if I'm out of coffee, water is fine, too.', whereas want, to me, feels heavier and often comes with experiencing some kind of emotional discomfort when perceiving the lack of the desire. You know you don't need it, but if you don't get it, that's gonna be a problem.

**Indifference** is the GOAT. If you can get to a point where you don't care, deliberate manifestation will become so much easier. For example, people experience indifference when they are aware of their god state or when they reach the so called sabbath.

# So why should I care about detachment?

While we can get what we want from any point of this spectrum, the closer we can get to indifference, the better our chances at receiving our desire quickly and the better we will feel along the way. This is not about reaching monk levels of detachment, but simply creating a less resistant path for ourselves, to make things easier on us.

When you're viewing your desired reality from a perspective of **need**, you will likely experience a lot of *anxiety and fear* around it not manifesting, and will be at risk of being very resistant and *easily triggered* by the current 3d circumstances. Whereas, when you're looking at that same desired reality from a perspective of **preference** or indifference, you *know you'll be fine* either way. You can more easily make peace with the current 3d, knowing it can't hurt you and you'll be able to *trust the process and live in the end* much more easily.

# How can I move in the direction of detachment in regards to my desired reality

1.CHILL OUT

Seriously, chill. The more time you spend relaxing, taking deep breaths, singing, dancing, painting or whatever else helps you feel less on edge, the less time you'll spend marinating in stress hormones and thus, the easier it will be for you to become aware that you are actually just fine. Relaxation is so incredibly helpful in so many ways when we are learning to deliberately manifest, yet so overlooked. Give it a try, please. It could change your life.

2. PLAY YOUR FEAR OUT IN YOUR MIND

I know this might be controversial, but hear me out. Most of the time when we are in need, it is not because there is an objective threat to our life, but because our bodies are sending an alarm signal triggered by our subjective perception of 'danger'. This is based on our current beliefs and sometimes, the only thing you need to do to get from the need to the want side of the spectrum is to *actually consider* what would really happen if you didn't get what you're aiming for. In most cases you'll immediately realize that there is no actual threat to your safety. It might be scary and really uncomfortable, and it goes without saying we don't want to repeatedly spend time focusing on this. But for the sake of detaching, sometimes you need to look your fear in the eye so that you can see it for what it is. In actuality, we will survive most of the things life could potentially throw at us.

3. CREATE A SAFETY NET

Again, potentially controversial, but I really think it's a matter of interpretation. Having a plan B can help you detach, if that's how you choose to look at it. Of course, we don't want to plan for or expect failure and we don't want to spend our days focusing on a reality where things don't go our way. But what if you created a safety net for the sole purpose of *not* having to think about that possibility. Not 'in case it doesn't work' but 'so that it works even better because I'm more relaxed about it'. As I said, interpretation.

This could look like ""I want this specific job, but I'm gonna apply for these others as well."" or ""I don't want to see a doctor about this, but if my symptoms don't resolve within the month, I'll go."" Anything that will get you closer to feeling like what you're aiming to manifest is what you prefer to experience, not what your life and happiness depend upon.

4. ADDRESS OUTDATED BELIEFS / MEET THE NEED

This is one big reason why people always tell you to work on self concept, especially with SP manifestation. Over and over again, you hear people say ""The moment I stopped wanting them, they came back"". Getting there is not *just* about self confidence though. Sometimes, the perception of need comes from another old belief that no longer serves us. These are often irrational and stem from childhood. As children, being approved of by our caregivers is essential for our survival, which can often cause us to feel like we will actually die if we are rejected, left alone, not chosen, etc. Or if you grew up in poverty/financial insecurity, that will most likely have left some kind of belief around survival needs that could get triggered.

As adults, we are capable of meeting many of these needs without being dependent on one person's cooperation. Often, by changing the underlying beliefs (which can be done with any manifestation method of your liking) we can meet the need by ourselves and come out of it feeling more whole and at peace. And more detached.

5. AFFIRM

Sometimes - especially if you have already done any of the other ways to get out of need - it really is as simple as just taking a deep breath and reminding yourself: I want/prefer this. I do not need it. I am safe.

# I tried everything you suggest and I still feel like I need it desperately. What now?

Take some deep breaths, it's okay. You'll still get what you want, regardless.

Revisit this another day, maybe you'll feel differently about it.

And also, make it a part of your every day practice. Keep affirming, meditating, breathing to let go of need. Keep reminding yourself of your new beliefs, your new identity. At the end of the day, the most important thing for us to do is trust. In the law, in ourselves, in life. Developing a general sense of safety, so that we can start going through life feeling more at ease.

Ever felt like you're juggling too many balls and they're all crashing down? üòÖ That was me with time blocking‚Äîan absolute train wreck! Let me share how **habit stacking** became my surprising savior, freeing up 10 hours a week. üöÄ

So, picture this: I was all hyped up to try time blocking. ""This is it! My life will be organized!"" I thought. But fast forward a few days, and BAM! Chaos: unforgiving emails, sudden urgent tasks, and, oh‚Äîdistractions galore! Sound familiar? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Here‚Äôs why **time blocking didn‚Äôt work for me**:
- **Unpredictable Schedules:** Life doesn't always fit those neat little boxes on a planner, right?
- **Busted Focus:** Trying to focus for long chunks of time was like wrestling a bear (i.e., impossible for me).
- **Feeling Trapped:** Being tied to a rigid schedule felt more like a prison than a productivity hack.

But hey, let's talk about how **habit stacking** swooped in with a cape and some serious productivity magic! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Here's why **habit stacking clicked**:
1. **Flexibility:** It‚Äôs like a puzzle; if one piece doesn‚Äôt fit today, swap it out for another tomorrow.
2. **Piggybacking Wins:** Stacking new habits on old routines means I barely noticed the change. Coffee in the morning? Add a podcast. Voil√†, learning time!
3. **Little Victories:** Cheered myself for small wins every day instead of drowning in block-busting guilt. üéâ

Want a lift in your productivity game? Here‚Äôs how you can start small:
- **Identify Keystones:** Find existing habits you already do without thinking‚Äîmorning coffee, evening walk, etc.
- **Stack Meaningful Habits:** Add something beneficial but enjoyable next, like stretching or tidying up.
- **Celebrate:** High-five yourself! üéà

Suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt just ticking tasks off a list; I was building a lifestyle that made productivity almost...effortless. Who knew, right?

So, this happened almost exactly a year ago, with the help of the people I love and my therapists I've been able to move on, but obviously sometimes it's still on my mind. I apologize in advance for le bad English, not my native language (I'm from Latam). 

So I (21M) lived with my cousin (22M) for about 3 years. I was from a smaller city and I moved in with him since the family (aunt, uncle and younger cousin) had moved out to a house in a rural-ish area months ago. They asked if I wanted to move in with him so I could go to college in the city without having to rent an apartment, and all that. Of course, I was super excited.

My cousin had been my best friend my whole life. We grew up together, had so much in common, he was like my brother. I trusted him a lot and looked up to him. Everything sucked around the time I was in highschool, I never really talked about it in the moment, but just playing videogames over skype with him would help me forget the pain I had to wake up to everyday. I really can¬¥t put into words how important he was to me. My aunt too, she's one of the kindest and most hardworking people I've ever met and I still love her very much.

I got to move out of my hometown (being there was causing me a lot of pain) live in a nice big house with a person I loved spending time with, while finally going to college. Things were still hard for me for other reasons, but I was so grateful for everything.

Fast forward, one weekend while I was away visiting my parents, my cousin caught some flak from my aunt because we hadn't been dedicated enough to the cleaning and maintenance of the home, since it was her house she trusted to us, and she knew we could've been working harder. When I came back, my cousin was extremely serious about everything. He would tell me every time I'd do something wrong. Which was fine, I thought it was good, but a couple of times I definitely didn't take it well. I'd come home stressed after a long awful day and the first thing he'd say to me is that I hadn't washed my coffee mug before leaving.

Maybe he thought I was mad because I didn't care about doing my chores, but I was mad because sometimes I just wanted to chat like we used to and now he was so serious all the time. We started drifting apart from that. 

Some time later, I'm in class. I get a text from my uncle. Nothing out of the ordinary until he told me he wanted to share something with me but it was very important that we ""don't tell anyone else, since we're both adults"". I won't go into details, it's not the point and it's gross to remember, but he said some very sexually explicit things to me. Some time after this, I found out he had harassed my mom, my older sister when she was underage, and even my dad. Among other things. Apparently everyone knew he was disgusting but until now nobody had said anything.

I was in shock. I stormed out and texted my mom, tried to call my aunt. I stopped crying from desperation and started crying from rage when my uncle picked up (he grabbed my aunt's phone because he knew I'd try telling her I guess). During all of this, he was texting me telling me everything is fine, I shouldn't make a big deal or tell anyone, etc. After he found out I told someone, he started calling me stupid and immature.

I managed to speak with my aunt. Told me she was disgusted by his actions and she was going to talk to him about it. She told me to not tell my cousin since she'd do it when she was ready. I kinda knew she wasn't going to do it. I get it, I wouldn't be excited either.

Months passed and I just couldn't bear to look at my cousin in the eye because of what happened. He was my best friend, he was there to support me and I was there for him too. I just wanted to tell him what was happening to me and why I was hurting so much. We stopped talking. We started avoiding each other. I literally hadn't seen the face of the person I was living with for like 5 months.

At one point I decided I had enough. I was going to try and talk to him about it because I just wanted to have my brother back. I texted him even though we were in the same house, asked if he wanted to come to my room and talk about what's been happening. He said no and barely agreed to talk over text.

I told him I wanted to know his side of things, because I only knew mine. He told me that because I didn't react well some times when he'd ask me to be more responsible around the house he just assumed I was not ""someone you could really talk to"", so stopped trying. I told him something happened that was really hard for me to deal with but that I was told to not tell him. 

He said ""well, then it's not relevant.""

I got really frustrated, and started telling him. I didn't finish. He told me that he probably knew what I was going to say, and that it wasn't going to help him in any way, so that I should stop. That he gets that maybe this would be healing for me but that he's not gonna be the one to gonna help me through this situation. 

We stopped talking after that and haven't ever since. He moved really far away so I don't know if I'll ever see him again.

So...

It would be extremely hard for me to hear that a family member of mine could so something so horrible to someone I love, but I just can't wrap my head around the lack of empathy I felt from him that day. I was sure we'd always be there for each other. That's not the case anymore and sometimes I still can't believe it.

I'm hurt he never tried to talk to me. Never wondered if something was up, just assumed I was a lazy piece of shit. Hurt that it seemed so easy for him to just cut me off completely.

I think I was wrong to try and tell him. It wasn't my place, but I just couldn't live in the same house as him just sitting on what happened. While knowing that he surely noticed something was up, but just didn't care enough to ask. ""Why isn't dad coming over anymore when he used to be here almost every day? Why aren't we coming over to their house for lunch just like we did every Sunday? Why do we not go out as a family anymore? Why is... everything different?""

I don't know, I keep telling myself I did the best I could at the moment, but sometimes I wonder. So, AITA?

Reading all of these posts and stories made me wonder how on earth I got into where I did a decade ago. I was an oddball personality student that slacked upwards to success in class and only really gave 100% effort in my main EC (debate).

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (Indian)
* Residence: Texas
* Income Bracket: Upper middle class
* Type of School: Very large public (well regarded in-state, 1/3rd of our graduating class ended up at UT Austin or Texas A&M)
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None

**Intended Major(s)**: Economics and Statistics. I figured this out thanks to my sophomore-year AP Stats teacher who made a big impact on me and I kept in touch with in college.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 4.0/don't remember weighted \[my school had this weird system where they just tacked on a multiplier if you took an honors or AP course\]
* Rank (or percentile): 42/\~700 \[at the time, this was good enough for auto-admission to UT Austin\]
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 7 honors, 17 AP courses
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Physics C, AP Human Geography, AP Art History, AP Macroeconomics (1 semester), AP Government (1 semester), AP English Lit, Debate
   * Special math course that our school arranged at the last minute for 30 of us since the district required everyone to take a math course every year and they didn't have a course after AP Calculus BC previously.

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT I: 2280/2400 (single test, don't remember splits)
* ACT: 32 (this was offered randomly in-school one day)
* SAT II: Math II (750), World History (740)
* AP/IB: Art History (5), Calculus AB (5), Calculus BC (5), Chemistry (4), Computer Science (5), English Language (5), English Literature (5), Government (5), Human Geography (5), Macroeconomics (5), Physics 1 (5), Physics 2 (3), Physics C: Mechanics (4), Physics C: E&M (3), Statistics (5), US History (5), World History (5)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Speech and Debate Team Captain - I spent way too many hours preparing and arguing random topics. At one point I was solo coaching my event team (LD) and 8 novices because our debate program director knew nothing about debate and was phoning it in for an extra stipend on his paycheck. 3x state qualifier in multiple events, modest state and national level success. I got a sports letterman jacket for it too.
2. Model UN - I participated on the club team but I wasn't good at it. It was fun though.
3. Tennis - I played on the school freshman team since I had played since I was 5. However, the team head coach at the time basically told me I was blocked from advancing further because of my physical build (not lean enough, too much power), so I quit the school team and just played USTA junior tournaments for the rest of high school.
4. Volunteering - Every week I volunteered at the local library and at a homeless shelter. It was worth it in my opinion if only because it helped shape my worldview which has served me well.
5. UIL Academics - This is a series of academic competitions organized by the Texas state government that any public school can compete in. I was asked to compete in a math competition (Number Sense) and LD debate. I got out of districts once and to regionals for debate but that was it.
6. National Honor Society - I was inducted at the end of Sophomore year and remained in good standing all the way until graduation....when I forgot about the last requirement so I didn't get a special graduation stole.
7. Biotech Lab Intern/HS Research Program - One summer I did guided biotech research as part of a local university program for high schoolers. Another summer I spent a few hours per day growing cell cultures and creating cell culture media for a biotech lab at that same local university.

**Awards/Honors**

1. AP Scholar (distinction)
2. National Merit Commended Scholar
3. I had some kind of small honor from the National Speech and Debate Association
4. Mu Alpha Theta

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Stats Teacher - 10/10, probably my best letter and the person I had the best relationship with. I would not be doing what I do today if not for her.

AP US History Teacher - 9/10, second best letter, I always talked in her class (and would often be the only one), even though sometimes I agitated with contrarian views of history (which got me into arguments with the two people who sat next to me - one of which unironically believed that we should return to the control of the British monarchy, and another who supported neo Nazi thinking....). She appreciated my persistence and determination to push the class beyond.

AP Human Geography/World History teacher - 6/10 - This was probably my weakest letter IMO and it was honestly redundant given my US History teacher's letter.

**Interviews**

Northwestern (interview since abolished) - This was not great because I had no idea what to expect since this was my first interview and online interview resources were way less available back then. I also didn't have anyone in my life or family that had done college interviews before. I talked to the female alum for about 30 minutes, I was nervous AF, and I ran away as quickly as possible.

UT Business Honors (also since abolished) - Awful interview because it happened unscheduled without any warning. I was chilling at home on a couch watching football with my dad when our home phone rang. Turns out the caller was from the Business Honors program and he interviewed me on the spot for admission. Naturally I didn't do the best.

UChicago (also since abolished) - I got used to interviewing by this point and this one felt really casual at a nice coffee shop in town. We had a good conversation, the female alum went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and I felt great about it.

Columbia (also since abolished) - Unremarkable honestly. I have zero memory of what me and the male alum talked about outside of the Wall Street Journal.

UPenn - This one I remember the most because it came up that I was LGBT and so was the male alum (based on his LinkedIn) and it felt validating that an adult accepted who I was (I was still in the closet to friends and family).

**Essays**

Common app + supplements: 8/10. All I remember is that I talked about the big personal interest I had at the time (trash reuse and waste reduction), how I implemented it in my life, and a biotech idea I had for an innovation in composting technology. This was a pain to write because I wasn't confident and got peer feedback that was negative for months. \[And in hindsight this made no sense with what I wanted to study\]

UT: 9/10. It was two long essays. In one I had to talk about the environment I was raised in and how it shaped me as a person (I talked about my religion) and in another I reworked my common app essay about trash to frame it as an interest I had.

UC system: 10/10. I was most proud of these because I could just speak from the heart. It was two long essays. In one I had to talk about the world I came from and how it shaped my dreams/aspirations (again I talked about my religion), and in the other I talked about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience I had (I talked about my experience in speech and debate).

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I applied only to out of state and dream schools knowing that I had UT Austin automatically clinched as a good option if everything went wrong.

*Acceptances:*

* ***UC Berkeley (graduated 2020)***
* Michigan
* UT Austin (automatic admission, would have been unspecified Business at McCombs)
* UCLA

*Waitlists:*

* NYU (they held me on a waitlist until mid-July --> fun fact, I didn't realize until later that NYU has no statistics department)

*Rejections:*

* UT Austin Business Honors
* UPenn
* UChicago (ED deferred -> rejected)
* Columbia
* Northwestern

**Additional Information:**

Y'all seem to have it rough out there with higher admission standards, higher costs, and a need to overperform in all facets. If I applied today, I feel like I would be in a rough spot and end up at a lesser regarded college. My resume was basically good grades, good test scores and debate.

I would also not have automatic admission at UT Austin to fall back on (since I would miss the top 6% cutoff rule on a rounding error, and next year it's being lowered to top 5%).

I kind of expected these results. The private schools seemed like a parallel inaccessible universe to me, except for UChicago where I thought I had a chance given my interview.

I was legitimately shocked to get into Berkeley, when I opened the email decision letter I screamed my head off for 20 minutes like a mad man. That place made me who I am today and I'm a better person and member of society for it.",8,1743541871.0,collegeresults,1,1.0,False

**AITA for laughing at my cousin when she asked me to hang out with her teenage kids?**



Okay, so this literally JUST happened and I was like ‚Äúyo, I gotta post this ASAP because what the fuck?‚Äù

I just posted recently about my grandfather‚Äôs funeral (which was a shitshow within itself), but this started BEFORE the ceremony.

I live in a different state than the majority of my family, I‚Äôm 28, work full-time, doing stuff with my day and my life‚Ä¶y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶being twenty-fuckin‚Äô-eight.

OF COURSE, that doesn‚Äôt matter and I should always make time for family yada-yada-yada. Let‚Äôs just ignore the fact that I actually KNOW about 15% of you by face and maybe 7% by name (sorry, but between the 400 Mildred‚Äôs, the 250 Linda‚Äôs, 800 Stephanie‚Äôs, Chelsea‚Äôs and Janet‚Äôs that I see once every full planetary alignment‚Ä¶someone‚Äôs bound to get lost in the weeds).

I obviously make time for my parents, grandmother, siblings when we‚Äôre all available (I‚Äôm the youngest out of three and while my job is pretty good, compared to theirs, it‚Äôs definitely the most lenient) and anyone else that I see on a regular basis.

ANYWAY, back to the funeral. During the pre-ceremonial gathering, I‚Äôm being showered with ‚Äúdo you remember me?‚Äù, ‚Äúdo you know who I am?‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a long time!‚Äù I say yes, yes and yes to avoid the bullshit.

So in the midst of that, one of my cousins whom I have zero memory of, but she apparently regularly talks to my mom, comes up to me and introduces me to her kids. We exchange pleasantries and they seem SUPER happy to meet me and their mom says that‚Äôve been ‚Äúabsolutely dying to meet me‚Äù‚Ä¶..

My brain is like ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù, but I just shake it off at that moment because I wasn‚Äôt in a good mood and just didn‚Äôt wanna focus on it. My cousin tells me they‚Äôre around my age and that they also live in my state and are actually about a 40 minute drive from my place.

Oh, that‚Äôs awesome! (I don‚Äôt care).

She suggests a little get together sometime later this year and says she‚Äôll talk to my mom about it. Which sure, that‚Äôs fine. I mean, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm 14 and have to ask her permission to do anything anymore, but I took it as a ‚Äúcool, I don‚Äôt have to worry about it then‚Äù and left it at that.

FAST FORWARD to about 45 minutes ago.

It‚Äôs almost midnight.

I get a call from a number that‚Äôs based in the city most of my family lives in the other state. Not only that, but it‚Äôs a VERY specific location. Too specific to just be a spam call so naturally I kind of panicked. My grandmother was down there at the time and she‚Äôs only a few years younger than my late grandfather so call me a little paranoid.

I answer.

‚ÄúHey (my name)! It‚Äôs (cousin)! How‚Äôre you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeyyyyy! (I don‚Äôt know who the fuck). What‚Äôs up? What‚Äôs going on? Everything okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! (Sounding confused by my question). Everything‚Äôs fine! I was just calling to see when you were available to meet (son & daughter) for lunch this weekend!‚Äù

After I was finally able to put together who this was, I felt like that meme with all the equations floating around because there is NO WAY this woman called me at near midnight to schedule a fuckin‚Äô play date.

I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember at the funeral? We talked about you and (kid‚Äôs names) getting together sometime later? (Daughter) is transferring to (university in my city) for her junior year and (son) is applying there too so they‚Äôre taking a tour on Saturday morning so I was thinking we could meet you afterward and you could take them somewhere for lunch. Just nowhere with alcohol just (son) is only 18‚Äù.

YO, WHAT?????

I remember her saying that they were around my age, but homie can‚Äôt even drink???? Then she starts rambling about how her daughter isn‚Äôt allowed to drink unless she or her husband are present because she‚Äôs 22 and doesn‚Äôt know what moderation means.

Maybe this is just me, but what in the God‚Äôs green Earth would a 28 (almost 29) year old have to talk about with a 18 and 22 year old that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs, focus on school and don‚Äôt go gettin‚Äô nobody pregnant‚Äù not to mention the fact I DON‚ÄôT EVEN KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

Before I knew it, I had started wheezing and squawking in the phone and cuz did NOT appreciate it.

I couldn‚Äôt hear what she said under my laughter, but I was like ‚Äúyeah, I don‚Äôt think so. I work a double on Saturday so I‚Äôm not getting off until like 8pm‚Äù.

‚ÄúWell, first of all, I don‚Äôt know what was so funny about what I said and you could easily just do a nice dinner or something. 8pm isn‚Äôt that late‚Äù.

My little patience is gone at this point.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I work a good 40 minutes away and this isn‚Äôt Star Trek. I‚Äôm not gettin‚Äô home until around 9 and I am not itchin‚Äô to babysit after an 11 hour shift. I can recommend some spots for y‚Äôall to check out yourselves, but this is a college town. You‚Äôre not going to find many places with ZERO alcohol, but it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have other drinks‚Äù.

‚ÄúExcuse me! I know your mother did not raise you to be rude like this ESPECIALLY to family!‚Äù

‚ÄúDUDE, I don‚Äôt know you! I have no idea who you are and you‚Äôre calling me at witching hour to schedule a hang out with your kids who are in fact NOT around my age‚Äù.

‚ÄúGirl, y‚Äôall are all YOUNG adults!‚Äù

‚ÄúI pay for my OWN medical insurance. We are not the same. PLEASE, do not call me again‚Äù.

I hung up and had a small cackle fit with my fianc√© who was awoken by this nonsense. Obviously I‚Äôm not going to hear about this until normal waking hours, but I lowkey hope she wakes my mom and bitches to her about me so my mom can cuss her out for calling either of us at such an ungodly hour.

But I know mom‚Äôs going to tell me that I could‚Äôve been a little nicer which honestly, I think I did just fine by not cussing during the conversation, but maybe that‚Äôs just me and my zero bullshit tolerance talking.

So AITA?

*NTA!! You handled that much better than I would have! I‚Äôve been known to answer the phone during the witching hours by saying ‚ÄúWho the F is this and you better be dying to call at this hour!‚Äù*

>OOP: She lucky that my phone was so specific about that area code or she would‚Äôve been sent into the void of voicemails that I don‚Äôt check and then delete.

*So, she wants a babysitter for her college kids? Good Lord! What a helicopter parent. If anything, you should lead them into temptation and debauchery for spite.*

>OOP: What‚Äôs stupid is that that would‚Äôve happened regardless of whether I meant it to or not because I am black sheep.



**Update - some hours later**



For those of you who saw the original post and were wanting to know how this whole mess ended, I just got off work so I am just now able to post an update.

Turns out, I cursed my mom by making a joke about my cousin calling her to bitch about me after she got off the phone with me because THAT‚ÄôS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID.

Woke my poor hardworking mother up to tattle on me. Now my mom‚Äôs an absolute peach (in front of me anyway), but I‚Äôve seen her cut up at people like a runaway chainsaw so she wasn‚Äôt foolin‚Äô me with her cutesy fairy act. (Tinkerbell can be petty bitch).

While she didn‚Äôt tell me what exactly she said, she mentioned that she said ‚Äúsome words‚Äù which is her way of saying ‚ÄúI cussed‚Äù and she hung up the phone after one sentence.

Once she got up and had her coffee, she called my cousin back and got the full details of the story and that‚Äôs when she called me.

I knew my sweet mom was having the worst time trying to keep a straight face and be a mother in that moment because the first thing she asked me when I answered was ‚Äúdid you make a Star Trek reference during a conversation with (cousin) as to why you wouldn‚Äôt be able to have dinner with her kids?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I did because she was making it sound like I had a transporter in my pocket, but still just have a car because I like to buy gas or something‚Äù.

I could totally hear her trying not to crack up through the phone.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she quite understands your humour, honey‚Äù.

‚ÄúWell, no surprise there because WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW EACH OTHER‚Äù.

She immediately broke and cackled so loud that my dad heard from another room and I heard him crack up through the speaker.

As much as I know she wanted to, she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to tell me to apologise just yet and told me to just hold off until (cousin) calms down some, but she‚Äôd keep me posted.

This was the part that almost made me crash my car (I was driving to work during this call).

‚ÄúSo, I know what (cousin) did was ridiculous, but do you think it was appropriate to laugh at her?‚Äù

I‚Äôm not gonna say exactly what he said, but apparently mom made up a very colourful name that included the N-word when my cousin woke her up this morning (don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre all black).

In all of my years of life, not one time have I heard my mom say that and I‚Äôm surprised she was able to recover from that amount of rage to even call this woman back let alone have a normal conversation.

So I think it goes without saying, I‚Äôm definitely not the way anyone needs to really be worried about pissing off from now on.

Compared to my mom when she‚Äôs tired, I‚Äôm a box of kittens.



**Comments**



**Noodle-and-Squish**

Your mom is amazing, and so are you. Honestly, if someone is calling me after 10 pm, there had better be a damn good reason for it, and if not, I would be using some colourful, creative language too.

Glad to see that the family experience is pretty universal. When I hit 18, I told my mom I wasn't playing nice with her sisters anymore (not outright rude, but I would not be putting up with the passive-aggressive bs). Aunties did not like it, would complain to mom, and she'd just shrug and say ""she's an adult"".



**Update - 4 days later**



Alright, guys, I‚Äôve finally gotten some time to sit down to write this out. This will be my final update on the situation with my cousin because I have officially had enough of this raccoon dog of an individual (which is what I will be referring to here as from here on as that is now her name in my contacts).

If you all thought the audacity and entitlement could not be topped, prepare to be just as wrong as I was. And if you did think so, well, I guess I‚Äôm just a fuckin‚Äô idiot.

ANYWAY.

Since I was off today, I decided to work on a new beer recipe I conjured up so I‚Äôm in the kitchen stove with my brew pot.

Now for context, when you home brew beer, the first thing you do is make the wort which is basically your sugar water. It‚Äôs made from a process of boiling grains in a kettle/pot then removing it from heat to add the malt extracts which you have to mix until it‚Äôs dissolved before boiling the mixture again. Afterward, you add the hops (what provide bitterness and a variety of flavours). My brews, in particular, are a little more complicated because I used different ingredients that I grow myself in the initial boil. Because of this, I take very great care to not waste any of it because these ingredients do take a long time to grow. This will be important later.

So, I‚Äôm chillin‚Äô, doing my thing when I get a call from THE RACCOON DOG FROM HELL.

After contemplating whether to send her to voicemail or not, my curiosity got the best of me and I answered.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Bleh, it‚Äôs RD‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh, hey‚Ä¶what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, I just wanted to apologise for the other day. I didn‚Äôt even think about what time it was. I‚Äôm usually up pretty late chatting with somebody (can‚Äôt relate) and I just went ahead and called‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah, I feel that, no worries‚Äù. (Seething internally).

‚ÄúSo listen, I know we got off to a bad start, but I was hopin‚Äô you‚Äôd reconsider hanging out with \[bleh\] and \[bleh\] since they don‚Äôt know anyone in that town and‚Ä¶I know you were concerned because you don‚Äôt know each other, I get it. I just want them to have someone present that they could be comfortable around‚Äù.

Now, as I said in previous comments, I think that‚Äôs totally fair. After all, she is their mother and she‚Äôs probably just trying to make sure college isn‚Äôt a drag for them. I personally hated going to classes and being around people I didn‚Äôt know for that long and I really wasn‚Äôt feeling the whole college mingle vibe so I took online classes and stayed home so I completely understood where she was coming from and I expressed that.

‚ÄúThank you for understanding. Now your mother told me that these things need to be scheduled in advance for you because of your job so I was thinking around Thanksgiving or Christmas time since we‚Äôll all be gathered together anyway‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah, sure, since we‚Äôll all be in the same spot anyway. I don‚Äôt see why not‚Äù.

‚ÄúGreat! Thank you so much! They‚Äôre going to be so excited‚Äù.

‚ÄúAwesome, sounds good‚Äù. Enter click clack of brew pot being returned to the hot stove.

‚ÄúAre you cooking something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh! You know how to cook?? What‚Äôre you making?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm making wort for a new recipe I‚Äôm trying out‚Äù.

‚ÄúWort? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs the sugar base for beer‚Äù.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry, did you say BEER?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making BEER?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, um‚Ä¶does your mother know you‚Äôre doing that?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe knows I know how to make it, so yeah, I guess?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù. Awkward silence.

‚ÄúYou did hear that I said beer and not cocaine, right?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT TOO?!‚Äù

‚ÄúNO! I asked because you‚Äôre acting like I‚Äôm breaking bad or something‚Äù.

‚ÄúI mean, I‚Äôm just concerned about how that might influence the kids so maybe don‚Äôt mention that when you hang out?‚Äù

Now, I already know that my career choice/hobbies aren‚Äôt ideal for some traditional families, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt get a little offended about how she reacted and treated something I‚Äôm so passionate about. The only reason I didn‚Äôt decline the hang out and hang up was because of the fact that 1. I was going to see them during the holidays anyway and 2. I don‚Äôt really talk about my passions in front of my family anyway out of respect and to avoid any extra bullshit so it‚Äôs not like it really would‚Äôve been an issue.

So I just rolled my eyes and agreed.

‚ÄúAWESOME! Okay, so last thing, I know there‚Äôs a lot of student housing in that area and cheap apartments so I was wondering which ones we should look into that would be close to the school, but also close to you too‚Äù.

Now, THIS is where shit got real and, I‚Äôll be honest, I grinned a little bit.

‚ÄúWell, my apartment is about a 5-10 minute walk from the school and the rates are pretty decent for a 2-bedroom‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS FANTASTIC. You guys could be neighbours!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeahhhh, about that‚Ä¶we actually won‚Äôt be in the area because WE‚ÄôRE MOVING to \[city that I work in that‚Äôs almost 40 miles away\] before the new year‚Äù.

‚ÄúOkayyyy‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm not really following. You‚Äôre saying you won‚Äôt be able to come see them?‚Äù

Insert Britney Spears WTF face.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no, not really. The whole purpose of the move is for us to be closer to our jobs so we won‚Äôt have to drive that far‚Äù.

‚ÄúBut you do it all the time so‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it like‚Ä¶once or twice a week to go see them‚Äù.

‚ÄúUuuuhhhhh‚Ä¶that would actually be super inconvenient for me I don‚Äôt think that would be very plausible‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inconvenient to spend a few hours of time with your family? Don‚Äôt you drive further to get to \[city where my parents live\]?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, yeah, but it‚Äôs usually because of traffic‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôll be even further when you move and you‚Äôd go see them anyway so I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so inconvenient about you driving halfway to spend time with your cousins. Especially on days like today where all you‚Äôll be doing is making alcohol when you could be spending time with your family. I mean, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶I feel your priorities here are a little backwards‚Äù.

Now I have PAINFULLY and CAREFULLY picked and chose my words while talking to this person during all of our conversations, but my brain pushed Civility in the closet and locked it for the rest of this conversation.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, did you really just compare the level of importance between your kids that I have said exactly one word to in my entire 28 years of life to my fuckin‚Äô PARENTS?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, first of all, honey, I don‚Äôt know who the HELL you think you talkin‚Äô to-‚Äú.

‚ÄúWho the fuck are you again? What do I owe you again? What part of my day or time do you deserve a piece of again? What meaning are you in my life again? What would I miss if we hadn‚Äôt met again? OH, NOTHING BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT FUCKING KNOW YOU and I don‚Äôt care if you decide to move in my fuckin‚Äô attic (I don‚Äôt have an attic) I‚Äôm going to go see why parents and bring them all the homemade booze I want YEARS before I even remember your fuckin‚Äô NAME and FUCK YOU for distracting me because my pot boiled over and now my fucking wort is RUINEEEEED!!!!‚Äù

That last part was in the heat over the moment, but I almost lost it when I heard my fianc√© bust a laugh in the next room. From what he described to me later, he said I sounded like an angry Bubbles from the Powerpuff Girls.

After that, I don‚Äôt even remember if she said anything because I was trying to clean up the sticky mess of my ruined concoction off of my stove and floor before my cat could get to it and was just cursing under my breath and all my irritation could muster was an angry ‚Äúsee you on Thanksgiving‚Äù before I hung up.

I haven‚Äôt heard anything else from anyone, but considering that blow up was so out of character for me, I‚Äôm almost 120% sure no one will have the nerve. It‚Äôs rare that I actually get mad so when I do, my parents have always just made sure I was okay and left it alone and would gatekeep anyone that tried to bring it up later.

My fianc√© came to help me clean the mess and I gotta give him props for being able to quickly make me laugh about how the sound I made when I saw the pot boil over.

I jokingly asked if he thinks I‚Äôd get in trouble for that, but he said that he thinks I scared her enough to send back to trash den for the a while.

I hope you guys have enjoyed this train wreck that I‚Äôve unleashed upon you and that your Thanksgiving is going to be as interesting as mine will be this year.

*I know you said it was the final update but I'm sure I'm not the only one hoping and praying for a Thanksgiving update .*



**Update - 7 weeks later**



ALRIGHT.

For everyone that was super invested in my family drama and wanted this last update, I did not forget you!

This is just the first time I‚Äôve had since Thanksgiving where I‚Äôve had absolutely nothing to do.

This will be the last update of this rollercoaster of mayhem so thank you everyone that took time out of their day to read all this and I‚Äôm happy that I was able to entertain you.

NOW for the moment you‚Äôve all been waiting for.

I know most of you guys were thinking it was going to be some sort of media circus monstrosity family dinner because I did too, but the Goddess of Chaos decided to be my bestie this year and make this holiday just oh, so perfect for me.

Thanksgiving with my family‚Ä¶WAS CLOSED.

My parents went to visit my brother, my grandmother went to home in honour of my grandfather, AND my fianc√© and I BOTH had to work Black Friday so we spent our Thanksgiving AT HOME IN PEACE.

We had a delicious meal, delicious drinks brewed by moi and cuddly PJ‚Äôs with a horror movie marathon.

It was absolute perfection and I was lovin‚Äô it like a fat cat in a canned tuna factory.

But then‚Ä¶

MY PHONE RANG.

It‚Äôs a number I don‚Äôt recognise so I ignore it. They go to voicemail. I‚Äôm on holiday vacation mode so that can wait until tomorrow.

A few minutes later, another call. Same number. Then another few minutes, another. Then another. Then another.

At this point, I‚Äôm about to put a salt barrier around my phone like that would somehow repel a phone stalker.

Then my fianc√©, being the rational genius he is, suggests that I listen to the voicemail‚Ä¶that I had completely forgotten about.

I put it on speaker for us to listen to‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHey \[SFM\] this is \[LANDLORD!!!!!\]‚Ä¶I‚Äôm using my personal phone because obviously‚Ä¶the office is closed. I am so sorry to interrupt your holiday, but I‚Äôm going to need you to call me back AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE‚Äù.

Well, I‚Äôve missed about 8 calls from this woman at this point, so I panic call her back.

Now at this point, you all are probably wondering where the Racoon Dog comes in. Oh, baby, it‚Äôs about to feel like Christmas.

Now, as I‚Äôm typing this out days after this went down, I don‚Äôt have the conversation memorised word for word, but I know I can get it pretty close. I remember what I said and my landlord was less than professional during this conversation (no judgment, I would‚Äôve been pissed to) so I think I‚Äôll be able to get the gist across.

I call my landlord.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù (Her tone like she found the whole turkey in the toilet).

‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm so sorry, I didn‚Äôt know this was you and I was-‚Äú

‚ÄúNah, nah, honey! I get it. You were enjoying your holiday like WE ALL should be. Don‚Äôt even worry about it‚Äù.

‚ÄúOkay (insert nervous chuckle here), so‚Ä¶what‚Äôs up? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know a woman by the name of \[RACOON DOG\]?‚Äù

Dude, the fact that I STILL forgot her name so I said ‚Äúnot off the top of my head, no‚Äù.

‚ÄúAlright, well she knows you and has been giving our courtesy officer hell for the past hour and a half because she said you invited her kids over and now she can‚Äôt get ahold of you‚Äù.

TELL ME THIS BITCH DIDN‚ÄôT TAKE THE ‚ÄúSEE YOU ON THANKSGIVING‚Äù COMMENT I MADE DURING OUR LAST PHONE CALL AS AN INVITATION TO COME TO MY HOME!!

Now at this point, I‚Äôm STILL not putting two and two together since it‚Äôs been A MONTH since my last interaction with this human. So I‚Äôm over here panicking like a squirrel trying to cross a busy intersection because for my landlord to call me from her CELLPHONE on THANKSGIVING‚Ä¶my brain said ‚Äúeviction notice‚Äù.

I explained that I have no idea who this could POSSIBLY be because neither of us invited anybody.

Landlord goes full nail salon black lady mode at this point.

‚ÄúSee, that‚Äôs what I thought because you guys don‚Äôt ever really have nobody around like that anyway. (RIP my landlord knowing that my fianc√© and I antisocial hermits) But she knows your name, she didn‚Äôt mention \[fianc√©\] and has been demanding we give her your room number, like really? No respectable establishment would just give out their tenants information like that even if we did you still breaking the law‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs she doing???‚Äù

‚ÄúShe parked in front of the fire zone with her kids in the car and is shouting ‚Äòpolice brutality‚Äô because our courtesy officer gave her a fine and told her that if she don‚Äôt move, we‚Äôre going to have her car towed‚Äù.

Mind you, the fine here for parking in front of a fire zone run between $500-$2,000 depending location and severity of the situation. My apartment is VERY close to the university and the main road to the separate properties is a very commonly used route directly to many of the university buildings as well as the a third of the fraternities.

So if there was a fire in that area, that section would most definitely be blocked off so they take this VERY VERY VEEEEERY seriously.

‚ÄúDid she move???‚Äù

‚ÄúNO! She got a fine for the fire zone and a then she threatened the courtesy officer so he had to call for BACKUP AND HER KIDS ARE STILL IN THE CAR‚Äù.

I CACKLED while I‚Äôm obviously still panicking because I STILL don‚Äôt know who this is because I‚Äôm an idiot.

My fianc√© started laughing like a maniac next to me.

‚ÄúYOOOO, IT‚ÄôS RACOON DOG (He‚Äôs in on the joke)!! I just texted your mom!‚Äù

‚ÄúBIIIIIIIIIITCH, WWWWHAT?!‚Äù

My landlord‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat dog??‚Äù and I explain EVERYTHING to her from the beginning and I can hear all the energy leave her body because all she can do is laugh.

This poor woman sounds so beaten down and exhausted as she asks me if I can officially state that I didn‚Äôt invite her and don‚Äôt want her here. I confirm this and this beautiful woman goes ‚Äúalright, I got this bitch. Y‚Äôall have yourselves an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL Thanksgiving‚Äù.

We ended the call and just in a silent mixture between disbelief, shock and trying not to laugh.

I kept thinking about this woman‚Äôs kids and how fuckin‚Äô embarrassed they must‚Äôve been. How I haven‚Äôt heard from somebody that they‚Äôve run away at this point is beyond me.

I tried to muster SOMETHING to say and all I did was open my mouth before my fianc√© stopped me with a‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNOPE. Nope, nope, nope. Nope. Eat. Watch‚Äù and just pressed play on our movie. Honestly, I had no idea what to say so I just complied while trying to hold in my laugh and not choke on my food.

I found out from my mom later that RD had contacted her and threw the BIGGEST TANTRUM because I apparently lied to her about spending Thanksgiving with her kids (during a phone call where I had literally cussed her out) AND caused her to get fined $2,000 by the courtesy officer (directed by my landlord) AS WELL AS her husband having to bail her out of jail for $3,500 AS WELL AS $7,500 fine for resisting arrest, trespassing, and threats of violence toward a police officer.

Yeah, aren‚Äôt I the fuckin‚Äô worst?

And I didn‚Äôt even have to lift a FINGER.

I still have barely any words on the situation and am still trying to convince myself that it actually happened and that it started from a random unsolicited phone call in the middle of the night a couple of months ago.

Now, did you guys think that was the best part? WRONG.

The pi√®ce de r√©sistance‚Ä¶

Two days ago‚Ä¶

Her kids made a group chat on one of my social media accounts with the three of us‚Ä¶and APOLOGISED FOR THEIR PSYCHO MOTHER AND ALL THE SHIT SHE‚ÄôS GIVEN ME ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THEM.

They said they had wanted to apologise for a while on her behalf, but were so embarrassed that they figured they‚Äôd just leave me alone, but what happened on Thanksgiving was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back for them which‚Ä¶YEAH.

The fact that instead of spending Thanksgiving with loved ones, enjoying a huge feast and a whole day to chill, these kids spent the majority of their day in the middle of a spectacle of pure insanity brought on by their delusional mother in a car at a random apartment complex and had to sit in a police station for who knows how long until they able to be picked up by the dad knowing their mom would be in jail overnight and getting her out alone would probably blow half of their Christmas fund‚Ä¶

All I could say in response was‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a really great pizza place up the street. I don‚Äôt know what you guys‚Äô schedule is like, but I‚Äôm off next Friday and it‚Äôs on me‚Äù.

Now I‚Äôve got a restraining order and a pizza date this weekend.

Combo made in heaven.

I hope y‚Äôall had as much fun reading this as I did writing it out. This whole thing has been SUCH a clustefuck dumpster explosion and I‚Äôm glad you all enjoyed sitting in it with me. Hope you guys had an awesome Thanksgiving with tons of love, food comas, sweatpants and NO cops (unless you‚Äôre a cop).

*I know those kids cannot wait to start college, and given your awesome landlord, I would ask her to take special care of them if they decide to move in. The special care would be keeping RD out*

1jp6xa3,https://i.redd.it/zymatmpjgase1.jpeg,Waiting For Godot in Coos Bay,"SO IT GOES COFFEEHOUSE PRESENTS WAITING FOR GODOT by SAMUEL BECKETT

‚ÄúOne of the most noble and moving plays of our generation, a threnody of hope deceived and deferred but never extinguished; a play suffused with tenderness for the whole human perplexity; with phrases that come like a sharp stab of beauty and pain.‚Äù The Times (London)

So It Goes Coffeehouse presents Samuel Beckett‚Äôs absurdist tragicomedy WAITING FOR GODOT for six performances only April 18th - 26th, 2025. Tickets are limited as the space is quite intimate. The show is presented in arrangement with Dramatists Play Service, Inc.

The production stars Taylor Marchant, John Beane, Tim Novotny, and Grant Goodwin. WAITING FOR GODOT is directed by John Beane and assisted by Daneal Doerr.

A seminal work of twentieth-century drama, WAITING FOR GODOT was Samuel Beckett‚Äôs first professionally produced play. It opened in Paris in 1953 at the tiny Left Bank Theatre de Babylone, and has since become a cornerstone of twentieth-century theater.

The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men waiting for someone or something named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree on a barren stretch of road, inhabiting a drama spun from their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and the unknown, which has been interpreted as a somber summation of mankind‚Äôs inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett‚Äôs language pioneered an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existentialism of post-World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.

Performances are Friday April 18th, Saturday April 19th, Sunday April 20th, Thursday April 24th, Friday April 25th, Saturday April 26th. All shows are at 7pm. Tickets may be purchased online at soitgoescoffee.com or at the shop, seven days a week 7AM-2PM. All performances take place at So It Goes, 190 Central Avenue, Coos Bay, Oregon, 97459.

So It Goes Coffeehouse is Coos Bay‚Äôs old school coffeehouse featuring killer coffee, full bakery, used books, music, bad poetry, and small absurdist theatrics. We are located at 190 Central Avenue, Coos Bay, Oregon, 97459. 541.808.9333.

1jp6w0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jp6w0c/the_fifth_roommate/,The Fifth Roommate,"The apartment was only supposed to have four people.

That‚Äôs what the lease said. That‚Äôs what the landlord told them. That‚Äôs what they all agreed on.

So why was there a fifth?

It started with small things.

A toothbrush in the bathroom none of them recognized. A pair of shoes by the door that didn‚Äôt belong to any of them. A bowl left in the sink, half-filled with soggy cereal.

‚ÄúI think one of us has a guest over,‚Äù Oliver said one morning, stirring her coffee.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù Jake muttered.

‚ÄúNeither did I,‚Äù said Sam.

They all looked at Martin.

He frowned. ‚ÄúWhat? I live here alone half the time. You think I snuck someone in?‚Äù

A silence stretched between them.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Oliver finally said, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre just not as tidy as we think.‚Äù

They all wanted to believe that.

They shouldn‚Äôt have.

A week later, the whispers started.

Soft conversations just beyond the walls, muffled voices behind closed doors. Sam swore he heard someone breathing outside his room at night. Jake‚Äôs bedroom door was unlocked one morning, even though he never left it that way. Oliver woke up to the sound of footsteps in the hallway‚Äîbut everyone else was asleep.

And then, the most terrifying thing of all.

A group photo, taped to their fridge.

A picture of them sitting on the couch, smiling, drinks in hand. A moment none of them remembered taking.

But there were five people in the photo.

Five roommates.

And none of them could recognize the fifth face.

Panic set in. They searched the apartment top to bottom. Every closet, every corner, every locked space. They tore through their things, looking for signs of an intruder.

Nothing.

Until Jake opened the hall closet.

And inside, hanging neatly among their coats, was another jacket.

A dark hoodie, zipped up.

Jake reached inside the pocket.

And pulled out a key.

It looked exactly like theirs.

That night, they all agreed to stay in the living room. No one slept. No one spoke.

At 3:14 AM, the front door unlocked.

The knob turned.

The door swung open.

And someone walked in.

They didn‚Äôt run. They didn‚Äôt hide. They just stared.

Because standing in the doorway was a person they all knew.

A person who had always lived with them.

A person whose name was on the lease.

A person they couldn‚Äôt remember yesterday.

The fifth roommate smiled.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Fenton asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all acting like you don‚Äôt recognize me.‚Äù

And the worst part?

For most of my adult life so far (which has been brief) I‚Äôve avoided habitual caffeine use for the sake of not becoming reliant on it. However, with school and just daily happenings I‚Äôve found myself fatigued despite good sleep and eating habits. 

For that reason, I‚Äôve been wondering if caffeine is a necessity. I‚Äôve also been wondering how much it would help as simply a performance enhancer, as the boost of energy may help bring on some wit and focus that I sometimes feel I lack. 

All of that said, I don‚Äôt want to be reliant on it. I can remain energized throughout mornings without it and I hope to never get to the point where I couldn‚Äôt survive without a morning coffee. How slippery is the slope? Are there any tips on keeping a balanced use?

Today, I loaded the dishwasher, and realized that the garbage disposal was not turning on. I fished around, couldn't find anything, and cleaned what I could manually. Still wouldn't turn on. Texted BF the issue (I discovered this issue as I was cleaning before leaving the house) so that he'd be aware before he came home and inadvertently turned the disposal on and made it worse. I had recently cleaned my coffee machine. I wondered if maybe some coffee grounds had made their way into the sink and were the issue, so I apologized in advance. That happened once before (except I'd emptied a more significant amount of coffee grounds into the sink a year or two ago and he was understandably irritated by that, so I've been cautious about that ever since), so I just wanted to get ahead of the problem and make sure he knew I wasn't being careless.

He gets home, and fishes out a cylindrical cap to something. I must've knocked it off the counter and into the sink whilst doing the dishes/loading the dishwasher. It must've been placed in the garbage disposal such that when I was fishing around, it felt like the garbage disposal itself and I didn't realize it was a separate piece.

He sends me a picture of the cap, and about 4-5 long texts about how we need to be more careful in checking, and that I could've broken the garbage disposal. I feel a little taken aback and defensive by the length and vigor of his response, but have not yet substantively responded. I'm thinking to myself -- man, I identified a problem, made an earnest effort to fix the problem, alerted you to the problem so that it didn't catch you unawares, but still find myself getting chastised. If the roles had been reversed, I probably would've sent him a pic of it, and said -- Nice! Figured it out! And would've spent exactly .3 more seconds worth of energy on it before moving on. To be clear, this is not a situation where I have repeatedly made this error and that's why he is so frustrated. This is probably the third or fourth time in 3 years our garbage disposal has gotten stuck/not turned on for some reason or another. It's not something that we even remotely frequently bicker about.

Would love another opinion. Am I just being overly sensitive today? Is the way I'm feeling unreasonably defensive? Is this a normal exchange? Was his reaction proportional to the issue identified? It is important to me that my partner is able to experience small household stressors without it becoming a huge issue, or needing to lecture about it. But maybe I'm projecting, by viewing his feedback as a lecture? I feel a little crazy.

TL;DR: I identified a garbage disposal issue. Tried to fix it, but missed the issue. Alerted BF, who found the issue and sent me 4-5 long texts about how I need to be more careful and that I could've broken the garbage disposal. This is not a repeated issue. I'm taken aback by the length and vigor of his reaction, and am wondering if I'm being overly sensitive/projecting, or if his reaction might be a little disproportionate to the issue.

I tried everything so you don't have to,"After diving in Malapascua, I stayed in Bantayan for 3 weeks. By the way, from Malapascua, you can rent a boat for 3.5k for 4 pax going Bantayan Island OR commute by going to Maya Port, riding a bus/van to Don Pedro, and riding a bus/van to Hagnaya then ferry to Sta Fe Port.


Places To Go (worth it or not worth it FOR ME)

Context: I'm a laid back person and hates crowded place so my taste may differ from yours


WORTH IT:


1. Kota Beach (FREE, best to go at 3 PM onwards, beautiful sunrise and sunset)

5. Kota Park (Free, best for muni muni moments)


6. Baigad Lagoon Beach (150 RT boat, 250 entrance fee, 150 pool fee ‚Äî we didn't avail the pump boat, we just walked for 20 mins)

-must try their Lagoon Tour sobrang worth it at ang gandaaa (700 PHP for 2 pax, 1 hour) 



NOT WORTH IT FOR ME


1. Virgin Island (docking fee:200, ecological fee: 100, entrance fee: 350 ‚Äî just because andaming binabayaran pa and so-so lang naman)


2. Hilantagaan Island (300 PHP, snorkelling area for the island hopping tour but no fish, you can skip this)


3. Paradise Beach (50 PHP entrance, 50 PHP parking, small strip of land, difficult to find, adjacent to Sandira Beach, no sunshade; enter Sandira instead)


4. Ogtong Cave (150 PHP, so small ‚Äî too many people for a small cave)



Other Activities I did:

1. Paraw Sailing with Ocean Oddysey (2500 PHP for 2 pax, we did this at sunrise. Sobrang worth it!!!)


2. Visited Mangroves Area near Palm Trees Road
-pin PALM TREES in the map and you'll find this area. Locals there allowed us to take pictures and explore a little bit in the mangroves area



Accommodations (best to worst per experience):

1. Kandugyap House By The Sea (booked via Agoda, stayed for 4 nights, breakfast included)

-no corkage fee for outside food

-infinity pool overlooking the sea

-own small private beach that is kind of rocky and not advisable to swim during low tide

-signal is intermittent so not advisable if you are working


2. Sta Fe Beach Club (walked in, stayed for 4 nights, breakfast included)

-corkage fee for outside food

-everything in their menu is priced fairly and their ube cheese halo halo and scallops live to the hype

-have their own wifi BUT kinda slow at night and mobile signal there is intermittent for Smart and DITO

How To DIY (Bantayan Island is inexpensive if you know how to DIY)

-I rent a motorcycle for 21 days, 280/day (Burgman, usual price is 300-350 depending on how you negotiate). Every place is accessible on a motorcycle.

-For island hopping, go directly to Sta Fe Local Tourism Office. 1100 PHP for a boat good for 4 pax and 1 island. If you'll add another island, add 300 pesos. I heard other agency charge as much as 1950 PHP per head for 4 pax exclusive with all the fees mentioned above for island hopping, trust me, it won't cost that much

1jp6sic,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jp6sic/the_time_i_was_dinner/,The Time I was Dinner,"The crash was the easy part.

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next‚ÄîI was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver‚Äôs side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then‚Äî

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn‚Äôt just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. ‚ÄúHey! Thank God! I‚Äî‚Äù

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

‚ÄúCar crash?‚Äù His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you‚Äîdo you have a phone? I need to call for help.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNo phone. But my house ain‚Äôt far.‚Äù

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams‚Äîdark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. ""You need to eat,"" she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there‚Äôs a road nearby? A way I could walk?""

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. ""Roads around here ain‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ reliable. And you‚Äôre still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up.""

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

""Good, good,"" Mary murmured. ""You need your strength.""

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was ""a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land."" He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual‚Äîtoo casual. As if he already knew it wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren‚Äôt watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange‚Äîhooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

""Looking for something?"" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. ""Just stretching my legs.""

He nodded slowly. ""Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of‚Ä¶ keeping folks where they belong.""

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn‚Äôt explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident‚Äîsomething deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. ""Mornin‚Äô, dear. You slept in. That‚Äôs good, you need your rest.""

I swallowed hard. ""What time is it?""

""Oh, just past noon,"" she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. ""You must‚Äôve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal.""

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. ""Where‚Äôs Henry?""

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. ""Tending to some things outside. Won‚Äôt be back for a bit. But don‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôve got me to keep you company.""

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked‚Ä¶ darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. ""Go on, eat. You‚Äôre wasting away.""

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong‚Äîtoo dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

""Good, good,"" she said, that same pleased murmur from before. ""You're getting stronger already.""

I pushed my plate away. ""I‚Äî I think I need some air.""

Mary‚Äôs smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. ""Of course, dear. Just don‚Äôt wander too far.""

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn‚Äôt Henry. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then‚Äî

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. ""Something wrong, dear?""

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. ""No. Just thought I saw something.""

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ""Nothing out there but the woods, love. You‚Äôre safe in here.""

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then‚Äîlight footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it‚Äîthe chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

""Breakfast is ready,"" Mary called softly. ""Come on down now, dear.""

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I‚Äôd have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

""I‚Äôll be right there.""

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy‚Äîlike butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. ""There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?""

""Yeah,"" I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me‚Äîsteak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

""Eat up,"" Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn‚Äôt. The first bite hit my tongue‚Äîsavory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. ""Henry, about my car‚Äî""

""Checked it this morning,"" he cut in. ""Told you it was in bad shape.""

I held his gaze. ""How bad?""

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. ""Oh, honey. Ain‚Äôt no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you.""

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

""I don‚Äôt want to impose,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Maybe I can hike out, find help‚Äî""

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ""Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn‚Äôt last an hour out there.""

Henry grunted in agreement. ""Woods ain‚Äôt kind to folks who don‚Äôt belong.""

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""I need some air,"" I muttered, standing.

Mary‚Äôs smile twitched. ""Of course, dear.""

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth‚Äîsomething faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn‚Äôt just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn‚Äôt call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving‚Äî

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn‚Äôt the first person to end up here.

And if I didn‚Äôt figure out a way to escape, I wouldn‚Äôt be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn‚Äôt just a random patch of earth‚Äîit was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. ""You‚Äôre wandering again, sweetheart.""

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. ""I just‚Ä¶ wanted some air.""

Henry nodded slowly. ""That‚Äôs understandable."" He glanced past me, toward the clearing. ""See anything interesting?""

I forced my face into something neutral. ""Just trees.""

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry‚Äôs expression‚Äîdisappointment? Amusement?

""Good,"" he finally said. ""Best to keep your eyes on what‚Äôs in front of you. Not what‚Äôs behind.""

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. ""Come inside, dear. Supper‚Äôs almost ready.""

I hesitated.

Henry‚Äôs posture didn‚Äôt change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. ""Yeah. Sure.""

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it‚Äîlike the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else‚Äîsomething dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

""Sit,"" Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

""Go on,"" he said. ""You‚Äôve been looking a little thin.""

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. ""That‚Äôs a good boy.""

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle‚Äîevery muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. ""You‚Äôre gonna sleep well tonight,"" he said. ""Body‚Äôs working hard to heal. Needs the rest.""

I nodded. ""I appreciate everything. Really.""

His eyes flickered with amusement. ""We know, son. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking such good care of you.""

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice‚Äîlow, knowing. Henry.

""Sleep tight,"" he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned‚Äînot in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn‚Äôt satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn‚Äôt understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should‚Äîdeeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before‚Äî

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

""Who‚Äôs there?"" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then‚Äî

A whisper, soft as silk.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn‚Äôt mine. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. ""You‚Äôre one of us now.""

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn‚Äôt been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just‚Ä¶ ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

""I told you,"" she said, her voice low and silky. ""You‚Äôd be one of us soon enough.""

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me‚Äîgod, it was unbearable now‚Äîroared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

""I‚Äôm sorry,"" Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. ""You were always meant to be here. We‚Äôve been waiting for you. For so long.""

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn‚Äôt even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

""You‚Äôll understand soon,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll understand what we are. What we do.""

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

""Time to come home,"" she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn‚Äôt control.

And as Mary‚Äôs smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn‚Äôt happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary‚Äôs grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

""You're one of us now,"" she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt comforting. It wasn‚Äôt kind. It was something else entirely. ""You're not going anywhere. Not anymore.""

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn‚Äôt move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn‚Äôt clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she‚Äôd been talking about?

""You‚Äôve been chosen,"" she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. ""We all were. You just didn‚Äôt know it yet.""

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain‚Äîthe hunger‚Äîit was worse than anything I‚Äôd ever felt.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary‚Äôs smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. ""To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We‚Ä¶ evolve.""

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it‚Äîlike sand sifting through my fingers.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary‚Äôs smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. ""It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want. You‚Äôll see. Soon enough.""

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn‚Äôt fall. I didn‚Äôt collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren‚Äôt the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room‚Äîeverything about it‚Äîfelt warped.

""Where are you going?"" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house‚Äîit was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

""Don‚Äôt run,"" he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. ""There‚Äôs no place to go.""

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch‚Äîit was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren‚Äôt mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my face staring back at me. It was‚Ä¶ it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. ""What‚Ä¶ what have you done to me?"" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. ""We‚Äôve made you one of us,"" she said softly. ""You‚Äôre part of our family now. You‚Äôll understand. You‚Äôll feed. And then, when the time is right, you‚Äôll grow just like we did.""

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The hunger inside me‚Äîthe gnawing, terrible need‚Äîit was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I couldn‚Äôt run.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Time doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs all a blur now‚Äîshadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I‚Äôve fed.

It‚Äôs like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I should‚Äôve known when I first walked into that house‚Äîwhen I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There‚Äôs no escape from this. No way to break free of what they‚Äôve turned me into.

The hunger... it‚Äôs worse now. It doesn‚Äôt just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It‚Äôs like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can‚Äôt put it out. I can‚Äôt stop it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was before‚Äîwhat I *was*‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it‚Äôs gone. And in its place, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ *thing*. This creature that doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary‚Äîthey watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know. They know what I‚Äôve become. They know what I‚Äôve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don‚Äôt care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I‚Äôve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed‚Äîthe claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I‚Äôve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I‚Äôm starting to forget.

I‚Äôm forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there‚Äôs one thing I know for certain, deep down‚Äîone truth that‚Äôs still clear in the haze of everything that‚Äôs happened.

I‚Äôll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They‚Äôre familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She‚Äôs always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. ""You‚Äôre ready,"" she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm ready for. But I know I can‚Äôt stop it. The hunger. The change. It‚Äôs already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I‚Äôm not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it‚Äîthe hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that‚Äôs been gnawing at me. It‚Äôs in all of us now. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there‚Äôs something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she whispers, as though she‚Äôs been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it‚Äîlike a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don‚Äôt fight it. I won‚Äôt.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don‚Äôt feel regret.

I don‚Äôt feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there‚Äôs something else‚Äîsomething darker‚Äîbehind her eyes. She knows what‚Äôs coming. She‚Äôs been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that‚Äôs spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I‚Äôm not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It‚Äôs no longer a choice. I don‚Äôt even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They‚Äôre both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know what I‚Äôm about to do. They know what I‚Äôve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there‚Äôs only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It‚Äôs not a big knife, not like the ones I‚Äôve seen on the hooks above, but it‚Äôs sharp, and it‚Äôll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She‚Äôs the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she‚Äôs proud of me. Proud of what I‚Äôve become.

She nods slowly.

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù she says, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who‚Äôs still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn‚Äôt struggle. He doesn‚Äôt try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don‚Äôt hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that‚Äôs been in me for so long.

It‚Äôs warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don‚Äôt even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don‚Äôt even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There‚Äôs just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that‚Äôs taking hold of me.

When it‚Äôs over, I look at Mary again. She‚Äôs still smiling, still standing there, but there‚Äôs something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now,‚Äù she says, her voice softer than it‚Äôs ever been. ""You‚Äôve become just like us. And there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it‚Äôs made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of it matters anymore. I‚Äôve done what I was meant to do. I‚Äôve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It‚Äôs not Henry. Not Mary.

It‚Äôs something in the corner of the room, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn‚Äôt the window itself. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side.

A reflection. But it‚Äôs not my reflection. It‚Äôs... *someone else‚Äôs*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They‚Äôre banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I‚Äôm imagining it. If it‚Äôs just the blood, the hunger, the madness that‚Äôs warped my mind. But then I see it again‚Äîjust for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that. We‚Äôve already chosen you.‚Äù

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can‚Äôt hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary‚Äôs smile widens.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I‚Äôm left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger‚Ä¶

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next‚ÄîI was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver‚Äôs side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then‚Äî

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn‚Äôt just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. ‚ÄúHey! Thank God! I‚Äî‚Äù

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

‚ÄúCar crash?‚Äù His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you‚Äîdo you have a phone? I need to call for help.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNo phone. But my house ain‚Äôt far.‚Äù

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams‚Äîdark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. ""You need to eat,"" she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there‚Äôs a road nearby? A way I could walk?""

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. ""Roads around here ain‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ reliable. And you‚Äôre still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up.""

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

""Good, good,"" Mary murmured. ""You need your strength.""

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was ""a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land."" He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual‚Äîtoo casual. As if he already knew it wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren‚Äôt watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange‚Äîhooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

""Looking for something?"" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. ""Just stretching my legs.""

He nodded slowly. ""Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of‚Ä¶ keeping folks where they belong.""

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn‚Äôt explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident‚Äîsomething deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. ""Mornin‚Äô, dear. You slept in. That‚Äôs good, you need your rest.""

I swallowed hard. ""What time is it?""

""Oh, just past noon,"" she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. ""You must‚Äôve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal.""

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. ""Where‚Äôs Henry?""

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. ""Tending to some things outside. Won‚Äôt be back for a bit. But don‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôve got me to keep you company.""

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked‚Ä¶ darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. ""Go on, eat. You‚Äôre wasting away.""

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong‚Äîtoo dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

""Good, good,"" she said, that same pleased murmur from before. ""You're getting stronger already.""

I pushed my plate away. ""I‚Äî I think I need some air.""

Mary‚Äôs smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. ""Of course, dear. Just don‚Äôt wander too far.""

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn‚Äôt Henry. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then‚Äî

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. ""Something wrong, dear?""

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. ""No. Just thought I saw something.""

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ""Nothing out there but the woods, love. You‚Äôre safe in here.""

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then‚Äîlight footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it‚Äîthe chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

""Breakfast is ready,"" Mary called softly. ""Come on down now, dear.""

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I‚Äôd have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

""I‚Äôll be right there.""

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy‚Äîlike butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. ""There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?""

""Yeah,"" I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me‚Äîsteak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

""Eat up,"" Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn‚Äôt. The first bite hit my tongue‚Äîsavory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. ""Henry, about my car‚Äî""

""Checked it this morning,"" he cut in. ""Told you it was in bad shape.""

I held his gaze. ""How bad?""

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. ""Oh, honey. Ain‚Äôt no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you.""

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

""I don‚Äôt want to impose,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Maybe I can hike out, find help‚Äî""

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ""Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn‚Äôt last an hour out there.""

Henry grunted in agreement. ""Woods ain‚Äôt kind to folks who don‚Äôt belong.""

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""I need some air,"" I muttered, standing.

Mary‚Äôs smile twitched. ""Of course, dear.""

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth‚Äîsomething faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn‚Äôt just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn‚Äôt call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving‚Äî

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn‚Äôt the first person to end up here.

And if I didn‚Äôt figure out a way to escape, I wouldn‚Äôt be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn‚Äôt just a random patch of earth‚Äîit was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. ""You‚Äôre wandering again, sweetheart.""

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. ""I just‚Ä¶ wanted some air.""

Henry nodded slowly. ""That‚Äôs understandable."" He glanced past me, toward the clearing. ""See anything interesting?""

I forced my face into something neutral. ""Just trees.""

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry‚Äôs expression‚Äîdisappointment? Amusement?

""Good,"" he finally said. ""Best to keep your eyes on what‚Äôs in front of you. Not what‚Äôs behind.""

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. ""Come inside, dear. Supper‚Äôs almost ready.""

I hesitated.

Henry‚Äôs posture didn‚Äôt change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. ""Yeah. Sure.""

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it‚Äîlike the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else‚Äîsomething dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

""Sit,"" Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

""Go on,"" he said. ""You‚Äôve been looking a little thin.""

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. ""That‚Äôs a good boy.""

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle‚Äîevery muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. ""You‚Äôre gonna sleep well tonight,"" he said. ""Body‚Äôs working hard to heal. Needs the rest.""

I nodded. ""I appreciate everything. Really.""

His eyes flickered with amusement. ""We know, son. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking such good care of you.""

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice‚Äîlow, knowing. Henry.

""Sleep tight,"" he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned‚Äînot in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn‚Äôt satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn‚Äôt understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should‚Äîdeeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before‚Äî

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

""Who‚Äôs there?"" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then‚Äî

A whisper, soft as silk.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn‚Äôt mine. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. ""You‚Äôre one of us now.""

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn‚Äôt been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just‚Ä¶ ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

""I told you,"" she said, her voice low and silky. ""You‚Äôd be one of us soon enough.""

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me‚Äîgod, it was unbearable now‚Äîroared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

""I‚Äôm sorry,"" Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. ""You were always meant to be here. We‚Äôve been waiting for you. For so long.""

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn‚Äôt even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

""You‚Äôll understand soon,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll understand what we are. What we do.""

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

""Time to come home,"" she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn‚Äôt control.

And as Mary‚Äôs smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn‚Äôt happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary‚Äôs grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

""You're one of us now,"" she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt comforting. It wasn‚Äôt kind. It was something else entirely. ""You're not going anywhere. Not anymore.""

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn‚Äôt move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn‚Äôt clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she‚Äôd been talking about?

""You‚Äôve been chosen,"" she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. ""We all were. You just didn‚Äôt know it yet.""

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain‚Äîthe hunger‚Äîit was worse than anything I‚Äôd ever felt.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary‚Äôs smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. ""To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We‚Ä¶ evolve.""

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it‚Äîlike sand sifting through my fingers.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary‚Äôs smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. ""It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want. You‚Äôll see. Soon enough.""

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn‚Äôt fall. I didn‚Äôt collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren‚Äôt the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room‚Äîeverything about it‚Äîfelt warped.

""Where are you going?"" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house‚Äîit was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

""Don‚Äôt run,"" he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. ""There‚Äôs no place to go.""

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch‚Äîit was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren‚Äôt mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my face staring back at me. It was‚Ä¶ it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. ""What‚Ä¶ what have you done to me?"" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. ""We‚Äôve made you one of us,"" she said softly. ""You‚Äôre part of our family now. You‚Äôll understand. You‚Äôll feed. And then, when the time is right, you‚Äôll grow just like we did.""

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The hunger inside me‚Äîthe gnawing, terrible need‚Äîit was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I couldn‚Äôt run.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Time doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs all a blur now‚Äîshadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I‚Äôve fed.

It‚Äôs like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I should‚Äôve known when I first walked into that house‚Äîwhen I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There‚Äôs no escape from this. No way to break free of what they‚Äôve turned me into.

The hunger... it‚Äôs worse now. It doesn‚Äôt just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It‚Äôs like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can‚Äôt put it out. I can‚Äôt stop it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was before‚Äîwhat I *was*‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it‚Äôs gone. And in its place, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ *thing*. This creature that doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary‚Äîthey watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know. They know what I‚Äôve become. They know what I‚Äôve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don‚Äôt care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I‚Äôve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed‚Äîthe claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I‚Äôve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I‚Äôm starting to forget.

I‚Äôm forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there‚Äôs one thing I know for certain, deep down‚Äîone truth that‚Äôs still clear in the haze of everything that‚Äôs happened.

I‚Äôll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They‚Äôre familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She‚Äôs always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. ""You‚Äôre ready,"" she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm ready for. But I know I can‚Äôt stop it. The hunger. The change. It‚Äôs already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I‚Äôm not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it‚Äîthe hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that‚Äôs been gnawing at me. It‚Äôs in all of us now. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there‚Äôs something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she whispers, as though she‚Äôs been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it‚Äîlike a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don‚Äôt fight it. I won‚Äôt.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don‚Äôt feel regret.

I don‚Äôt feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there‚Äôs something else‚Äîsomething darker‚Äîbehind her eyes. She knows what‚Äôs coming. She‚Äôs been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that‚Äôs spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I‚Äôm not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It‚Äôs no longer a choice. I don‚Äôt even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They‚Äôre both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know what I‚Äôm about to do. They know what I‚Äôve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there‚Äôs only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It‚Äôs not a big knife, not like the ones I‚Äôve seen on the hooks above, but it‚Äôs sharp, and it‚Äôll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She‚Äôs the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she‚Äôs proud of me. Proud of what I‚Äôve become.

She nods slowly.

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù she says, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who‚Äôs still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn‚Äôt struggle. He doesn‚Äôt try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don‚Äôt hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that‚Äôs been in me for so long.

It‚Äôs warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don‚Äôt even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don‚Äôt even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There‚Äôs just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that‚Äôs taking hold of me.

When it‚Äôs over, I look at Mary again. She‚Äôs still smiling, still standing there, but there‚Äôs something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now,‚Äù she says, her voice softer than it‚Äôs ever been. ""You‚Äôve become just like us. And there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it‚Äôs made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of it matters anymore. I‚Äôve done what I was meant to do. I‚Äôve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It‚Äôs not Henry. Not Mary.

It‚Äôs something in the corner of the room, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn‚Äôt the window itself. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side.

A reflection. But it‚Äôs not my reflection. It‚Äôs... *someone else‚Äôs*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They‚Äôre banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I‚Äôm imagining it. If it‚Äôs just the blood, the hunger, the madness that‚Äôs warped my mind. But then I see it again‚Äîjust for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that. We‚Äôve already chosen you.‚Äù

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can‚Äôt hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary‚Äôs smile widens.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I‚Äôm left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger‚Ä¶

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next‚ÄîI was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver‚Äôs side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then‚Äî

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn‚Äôt just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. ‚ÄúHey! Thank God! I‚Äî‚Äù

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

‚ÄúCar crash?‚Äù His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you‚Äîdo you have a phone? I need to call for help.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNo phone. But my house ain‚Äôt far.‚Äù

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams‚Äîdark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. ""You need to eat,"" she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there‚Äôs a road nearby? A way I could walk?""

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. ""Roads around here ain‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ reliable. And you‚Äôre still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up.""

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

""Good, good,"" Mary murmured. ""You need your strength.""

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was ""a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land."" He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual‚Äîtoo casual. As if he already knew it wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren‚Äôt watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange‚Äîhooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

""Looking for something?"" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. ""Just stretching my legs.""

He nodded slowly. ""Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of‚Ä¶ keeping folks where they belong.""

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn‚Äôt explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident‚Äîsomething deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. ""Mornin‚Äô, dear. You slept in. That‚Äôs good, you need your rest.""

I swallowed hard. ""What time is it?""

""Oh, just past noon,"" she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. ""You must‚Äôve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal.""

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. ""Where‚Äôs Henry?""

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. ""Tending to some things outside. Won‚Äôt be back for a bit. But don‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôve got me to keep you company.""

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked‚Ä¶ darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. ""Go on, eat. You‚Äôre wasting away.""

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong‚Äîtoo dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

""Good, good,"" she said, that same pleased murmur from before. ""You're getting stronger already.""

I pushed my plate away. ""I‚Äî I think I need some air.""

Mary‚Äôs smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. ""Of course, dear. Just don‚Äôt wander too far.""

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn‚Äôt Henry. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then‚Äî

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. ""Something wrong, dear?""

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. ""No. Just thought I saw something.""

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ""Nothing out there but the woods, love. You‚Äôre safe in here.""

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then‚Äîlight footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it‚Äîthe chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

""Breakfast is ready,"" Mary called softly. ""Come on down now, dear.""

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I‚Äôd have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

""I‚Äôll be right there.""

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy‚Äîlike butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. ""There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?""

""Yeah,"" I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me‚Äîsteak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

""Eat up,"" Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn‚Äôt. The first bite hit my tongue‚Äîsavory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. ""Henry, about my car‚Äî""

""Checked it this morning,"" he cut in. ""Told you it was in bad shape.""

I held his gaze. ""How bad?""

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. ""Oh, honey. Ain‚Äôt no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you.""

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

""I don‚Äôt want to impose,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Maybe I can hike out, find help‚Äî""

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ""Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn‚Äôt last an hour out there.""

Henry grunted in agreement. ""Woods ain‚Äôt kind to folks who don‚Äôt belong.""

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""I need some air,"" I muttered, standing.

Mary‚Äôs smile twitched. ""Of course, dear.""

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth‚Äîsomething faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn‚Äôt just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn‚Äôt call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving‚Äî

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn‚Äôt the first person to end up here.

And if I didn‚Äôt figure out a way to escape, I wouldn‚Äôt be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn‚Äôt just a random patch of earth‚Äîit was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. ""You‚Äôre wandering again, sweetheart.""

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. ""I just‚Ä¶ wanted some air.""

Henry nodded slowly. ""That‚Äôs understandable."" He glanced past me, toward the clearing. ""See anything interesting?""

I forced my face into something neutral. ""Just trees.""

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry‚Äôs expression‚Äîdisappointment? Amusement?

""Good,"" he finally said. ""Best to keep your eyes on what‚Äôs in front of you. Not what‚Äôs behind.""

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. ""Come inside, dear. Supper‚Äôs almost ready.""

I hesitated.

Henry‚Äôs posture didn‚Äôt change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. ""Yeah. Sure.""

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it‚Äîlike the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else‚Äîsomething dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

""Sit,"" Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

""Go on,"" he said. ""You‚Äôve been looking a little thin.""

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. ""That‚Äôs a good boy.""

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle‚Äîevery muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. ""You‚Äôre gonna sleep well tonight,"" he said. ""Body‚Äôs working hard to heal. Needs the rest.""

I nodded. ""I appreciate everything. Really.""

His eyes flickered with amusement. ""We know, son. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking such good care of you.""

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice‚Äîlow, knowing. Henry.

""Sleep tight,"" he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned‚Äînot in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn‚Äôt satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn‚Äôt understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should‚Äîdeeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before‚Äî

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

""Who‚Äôs there?"" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then‚Äî

A whisper, soft as silk.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn‚Äôt mine. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. ""You‚Äôre one of us now.""

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn‚Äôt been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just‚Ä¶ ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

""I told you,"" she said, her voice low and silky. ""You‚Äôd be one of us soon enough.""

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me‚Äîgod, it was unbearable now‚Äîroared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

""I‚Äôm sorry,"" Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. ""You were always meant to be here. We‚Äôve been waiting for you. For so long.""

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn‚Äôt even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

""You‚Äôll understand soon,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll understand what we are. What we do.""

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

""Time to come home,"" she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn‚Äôt control.

And as Mary‚Äôs smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn‚Äôt happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary‚Äôs grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

""You're one of us now,"" she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt comforting. It wasn‚Äôt kind. It was something else entirely. ""You're not going anywhere. Not anymore.""

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn‚Äôt move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn‚Äôt clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she‚Äôd been talking about?

""You‚Äôve been chosen,"" she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. ""We all were. You just didn‚Äôt know it yet.""

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain‚Äîthe hunger‚Äîit was worse than anything I‚Äôd ever felt.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary‚Äôs smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. ""To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We‚Ä¶ evolve.""

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it‚Äîlike sand sifting through my fingers.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary‚Äôs smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. ""It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want. You‚Äôll see. Soon enough.""

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn‚Äôt fall. I didn‚Äôt collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren‚Äôt the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room‚Äîeverything about it‚Äîfelt warped.

""Where are you going?"" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house‚Äîit was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

""Don‚Äôt run,"" he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. ""There‚Äôs no place to go.""

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch‚Äîit was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren‚Äôt mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my face staring back at me. It was‚Ä¶ it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. ""What‚Ä¶ what have you done to me?"" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. ""We‚Äôve made you one of us,"" she said softly. ""You‚Äôre part of our family now. You‚Äôll understand. You‚Äôll feed. And then, when the time is right, you‚Äôll grow just like we did.""

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The hunger inside me‚Äîthe gnawing, terrible need‚Äîit was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I couldn‚Äôt run.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Time doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs all a blur now‚Äîshadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I‚Äôve fed.

It‚Äôs like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I should‚Äôve known when I first walked into that house‚Äîwhen I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There‚Äôs no escape from this. No way to break free of what they‚Äôve turned me into.

The hunger... it‚Äôs worse now. It doesn‚Äôt just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It‚Äôs like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can‚Äôt put it out. I can‚Äôt stop it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was before‚Äîwhat I *was*‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it‚Äôs gone. And in its place, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ *thing*. This creature that doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary‚Äîthey watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know. They know what I‚Äôve become. They know what I‚Äôve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don‚Äôt care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I‚Äôve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed‚Äîthe claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I‚Äôve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I‚Äôm starting to forget.

I‚Äôm forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there‚Äôs one thing I know for certain, deep down‚Äîone truth that‚Äôs still clear in the haze of everything that‚Äôs happened.

I‚Äôll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They‚Äôre familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She‚Äôs always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. ""You‚Äôre ready,"" she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm ready for. But I know I can‚Äôt stop it. The hunger. The change. It‚Äôs already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I‚Äôm not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it‚Äîthe hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that‚Äôs been gnawing at me. It‚Äôs in all of us now. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there‚Äôs something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she whispers, as though she‚Äôs been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it‚Äîlike a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don‚Äôt fight it. I won‚Äôt.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don‚Äôt feel regret.

I don‚Äôt feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there‚Äôs something else‚Äîsomething darker‚Äîbehind her eyes. She knows what‚Äôs coming. She‚Äôs been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that‚Äôs spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I‚Äôm not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It‚Äôs no longer a choice. I don‚Äôt even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They‚Äôre both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know what I‚Äôm about to do. They know what I‚Äôve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there‚Äôs only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It‚Äôs not a big knife, not like the ones I‚Äôve seen on the hooks above, but it‚Äôs sharp, and it‚Äôll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She‚Äôs the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she‚Äôs proud of me. Proud of what I‚Äôve become.

She nods slowly.

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù she says, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who‚Äôs still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn‚Äôt struggle. He doesn‚Äôt try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don‚Äôt hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that‚Äôs been in me for so long.

It‚Äôs warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don‚Äôt even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don‚Äôt even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There‚Äôs just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that‚Äôs taking hold of me.

When it‚Äôs over, I look at Mary again. She‚Äôs still smiling, still standing there, but there‚Äôs something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now,‚Äù she says, her voice softer than it‚Äôs ever been. ""You‚Äôve become just like us. And there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it‚Äôs made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of it matters anymore. I‚Äôve done what I was meant to do. I‚Äôve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It‚Äôs not Henry. Not Mary.

It‚Äôs something in the corner of the room, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn‚Äôt the window itself. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side.

A reflection. But it‚Äôs not my reflection. It‚Äôs... *someone else‚Äôs*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They‚Äôre banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I‚Äôm imagining it. If it‚Äôs just the blood, the hunger, the madness that‚Äôs warped my mind. But then I see it again‚Äîjust for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that. We‚Äôve already chosen you.‚Äù

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can‚Äôt hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary‚Äôs smile widens.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I‚Äôm left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger‚Ä¶

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next‚ÄîI was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver‚Äôs side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then‚Äî

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn‚Äôt just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. ‚ÄúHey! Thank God! I‚Äî‚Äù

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

‚ÄúCar crash?‚Äù His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you‚Äîdo you have a phone? I need to call for help.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNo phone. But my house ain‚Äôt far.‚Äù

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams‚Äîdark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. ""You need to eat,"" she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there‚Äôs a road nearby? A way I could walk?""

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. ""Roads around here ain‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ reliable. And you‚Äôre still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up.""

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

""Good, good,"" Mary murmured. ""You need your strength.""

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was ""a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land."" He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual‚Äîtoo casual. As if he already knew it wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren‚Äôt watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange‚Äîhooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

""Looking for something?"" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. ""Just stretching my legs.""

He nodded slowly. ""Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of‚Ä¶ keeping folks where they belong.""

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn‚Äôt explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident‚Äîsomething deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. ""Mornin‚Äô, dear. You slept in. That‚Äôs good, you need your rest.""

I swallowed hard. ""What time is it?""

""Oh, just past noon,"" she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. ""You must‚Äôve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal.""

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. ""Where‚Äôs Henry?""

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. ""Tending to some things outside. Won‚Äôt be back for a bit. But don‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôve got me to keep you company.""

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked‚Ä¶ darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. ""Go on, eat. You‚Äôre wasting away.""

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong‚Äîtoo dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

""Good, good,"" she said, that same pleased murmur from before. ""You're getting stronger already.""

I pushed my plate away. ""I‚Äî I think I need some air.""

Mary‚Äôs smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. ""Of course, dear. Just don‚Äôt wander too far.""

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn‚Äôt Henry. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then‚Äî

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. ""Something wrong, dear?""

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. ""No. Just thought I saw something.""

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ""Nothing out there but the woods, love. You‚Äôre safe in here.""

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then‚Äîlight footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it‚Äîthe chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

""Breakfast is ready,"" Mary called softly. ""Come on down now, dear.""

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I‚Äôd have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

""I‚Äôll be right there.""

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy‚Äîlike butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. ""There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?""

""Yeah,"" I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me‚Äîsteak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

""Eat up,"" Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn‚Äôt. The first bite hit my tongue‚Äîsavory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. ""Henry, about my car‚Äî""

""Checked it this morning,"" he cut in. ""Told you it was in bad shape.""

I held his gaze. ""How bad?""

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. ""Oh, honey. Ain‚Äôt no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you.""

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

""I don‚Äôt want to impose,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Maybe I can hike out, find help‚Äî""

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ""Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn‚Äôt last an hour out there.""

Henry grunted in agreement. ""Woods ain‚Äôt kind to folks who don‚Äôt belong.""

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""I need some air,"" I muttered, standing.

Mary‚Äôs smile twitched. ""Of course, dear.""

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth‚Äîsomething faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn‚Äôt just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn‚Äôt call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving‚Äî

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn‚Äôt the first person to end up here.

And if I didn‚Äôt figure out a way to escape, I wouldn‚Äôt be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn‚Äôt just a random patch of earth‚Äîit was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. ""You‚Äôre wandering again, sweetheart.""

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. ""I just‚Ä¶ wanted some air.""

Henry nodded slowly. ""That‚Äôs understandable."" He glanced past me, toward the clearing. ""See anything interesting?""

I forced my face into something neutral. ""Just trees.""

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry‚Äôs expression‚Äîdisappointment? Amusement?

""Good,"" he finally said. ""Best to keep your eyes on what‚Äôs in front of you. Not what‚Äôs behind.""

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. ""Come inside, dear. Supper‚Äôs almost ready.""

I hesitated.

Henry‚Äôs posture didn‚Äôt change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. ""Yeah. Sure.""

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it‚Äîlike the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else‚Äîsomething dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

""Sit,"" Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

""Go on,"" he said. ""You‚Äôve been looking a little thin.""

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. ""That‚Äôs a good boy.""

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle‚Äîevery muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. ""You‚Äôre gonna sleep well tonight,"" he said. ""Body‚Äôs working hard to heal. Needs the rest.""

I nodded. ""I appreciate everything. Really.""

His eyes flickered with amusement. ""We know, son. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking such good care of you.""

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice‚Äîlow, knowing. Henry.

""Sleep tight,"" he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned‚Äînot in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn‚Äôt satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn‚Äôt understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should‚Äîdeeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before‚Äî

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

""Who‚Äôs there?"" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then‚Äî

A whisper, soft as silk.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn‚Äôt mine. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. ""You‚Äôre one of us now.""

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn‚Äôt been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just‚Ä¶ ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

""I told you,"" she said, her voice low and silky. ""You‚Äôd be one of us soon enough.""

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me‚Äîgod, it was unbearable now‚Äîroared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

""I‚Äôm sorry,"" Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. ""You were always meant to be here. We‚Äôve been waiting for you. For so long.""

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn‚Äôt even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

""You‚Äôll understand soon,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll understand what we are. What we do.""

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

""Time to come home,"" she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn‚Äôt control.

And as Mary‚Äôs smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn‚Äôt happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary‚Äôs grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

""You're one of us now,"" she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt comforting. It wasn‚Äôt kind. It was something else entirely. ""You're not going anywhere. Not anymore.""

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn‚Äôt move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn‚Äôt clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she‚Äôd been talking about?

""You‚Äôve been chosen,"" she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. ""We all were. You just didn‚Äôt know it yet.""

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain‚Äîthe hunger‚Äîit was worse than anything I‚Äôd ever felt.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary‚Äôs smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. ""To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We‚Ä¶ evolve.""

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it‚Äîlike sand sifting through my fingers.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary‚Äôs smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. ""It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want. You‚Äôll see. Soon enough.""

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn‚Äôt fall. I didn‚Äôt collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren‚Äôt the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room‚Äîeverything about it‚Äîfelt warped.

""Where are you going?"" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house‚Äîit was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

""Don‚Äôt run,"" he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. ""There‚Äôs no place to go.""

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch‚Äîit was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren‚Äôt mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my face staring back at me. It was‚Ä¶ it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. ""What‚Ä¶ what have you done to me?"" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. ""We‚Äôve made you one of us,"" she said softly. ""You‚Äôre part of our family now. You‚Äôll understand. You‚Äôll feed. And then, when the time is right, you‚Äôll grow just like we did.""

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The hunger inside me‚Äîthe gnawing, terrible need‚Äîit was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I couldn‚Äôt run.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Time doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs all a blur now‚Äîshadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I‚Äôve fed.

It‚Äôs like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I should‚Äôve known when I first walked into that house‚Äîwhen I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There‚Äôs no escape from this. No way to break free of what they‚Äôve turned me into.

The hunger... it‚Äôs worse now. It doesn‚Äôt just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It‚Äôs like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can‚Äôt put it out. I can‚Äôt stop it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was before‚Äîwhat I *was*‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it‚Äôs gone. And in its place, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ *thing*. This creature that doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary‚Äîthey watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know. They know what I‚Äôve become. They know what I‚Äôve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don‚Äôt care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I‚Äôve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed‚Äîthe claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I‚Äôve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I‚Äôm starting to forget.

I‚Äôm forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there‚Äôs one thing I know for certain, deep down‚Äîone truth that‚Äôs still clear in the haze of everything that‚Äôs happened.

I‚Äôll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They‚Äôre familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She‚Äôs always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. ""You‚Äôre ready,"" she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm ready for. But I know I can‚Äôt stop it. The hunger. The change. It‚Äôs already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I‚Äôm not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it‚Äîthe hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that‚Äôs been gnawing at me. It‚Äôs in all of us now. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there‚Äôs something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she whispers, as though she‚Äôs been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it‚Äîlike a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don‚Äôt fight it. I won‚Äôt.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don‚Äôt feel regret.

I don‚Äôt feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there‚Äôs something else‚Äîsomething darker‚Äîbehind her eyes. She knows what‚Äôs coming. She‚Äôs been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that‚Äôs spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I‚Äôm not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It‚Äôs no longer a choice. I don‚Äôt even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They‚Äôre both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know what I‚Äôm about to do. They know what I‚Äôve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there‚Äôs only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It‚Äôs not a big knife, not like the ones I‚Äôve seen on the hooks above, but it‚Äôs sharp, and it‚Äôll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She‚Äôs the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she‚Äôs proud of me. Proud of what I‚Äôve become.

She nods slowly.

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù she says, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who‚Äôs still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn‚Äôt struggle. He doesn‚Äôt try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don‚Äôt hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that‚Äôs been in me for so long.

It‚Äôs warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don‚Äôt even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don‚Äôt even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There‚Äôs just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that‚Äôs taking hold of me.

When it‚Äôs over, I look at Mary again. She‚Äôs still smiling, still standing there, but there‚Äôs something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now,‚Äù she says, her voice softer than it‚Äôs ever been. ""You‚Äôve become just like us. And there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it‚Äôs made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of it matters anymore. I‚Äôve done what I was meant to do. I‚Äôve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It‚Äôs not Henry. Not Mary.

It‚Äôs something in the corner of the room, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn‚Äôt the window itself. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side.

A reflection. But it‚Äôs not my reflection. It‚Äôs... *someone else‚Äôs*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They‚Äôre banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I‚Äôm imagining it. If it‚Äôs just the blood, the hunger, the madness that‚Äôs warped my mind. But then I see it again‚Äîjust for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that. We‚Äôve already chosen you.‚Äù

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can‚Äôt hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary‚Äôs smile widens.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I‚Äôm left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger‚Ä¶

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next‚ÄîI was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver‚Äôs side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then‚Äî

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn‚Äôt just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. ‚ÄúHey! Thank God! I‚Äî‚Äù

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

‚ÄúCar crash?‚Äù His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you‚Äîdo you have a phone? I need to call for help.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNo phone. But my house ain‚Äôt far.‚Äù

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams‚Äîdark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. ""You need to eat,"" she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there‚Äôs a road nearby? A way I could walk?""

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. ""Roads around here ain‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ reliable. And you‚Äôre still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up.""

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

""Good, good,"" Mary murmured. ""You need your strength.""

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was ""a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land."" He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual‚Äîtoo casual. As if he already knew it wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren‚Äôt watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange‚Äîhooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

""Looking for something?"" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. ""Just stretching my legs.""

He nodded slowly. ""Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of‚Ä¶ keeping folks where they belong.""

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn‚Äôt explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident‚Äîsomething deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. ""Mornin‚Äô, dear. You slept in. That‚Äôs good, you need your rest.""

I swallowed hard. ""What time is it?""

""Oh, just past noon,"" she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. ""You must‚Äôve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal.""

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. ""Where‚Äôs Henry?""

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. ""Tending to some things outside. Won‚Äôt be back for a bit. But don‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôve got me to keep you company.""

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked‚Ä¶ darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. ""Go on, eat. You‚Äôre wasting away.""

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong‚Äîtoo dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

""Good, good,"" she said, that same pleased murmur from before. ""You're getting stronger already.""

I pushed my plate away. ""I‚Äî I think I need some air.""

Mary‚Äôs smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. ""Of course, dear. Just don‚Äôt wander too far.""

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn‚Äôt Henry. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then‚Äî

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. ""Something wrong, dear?""

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. ""No. Just thought I saw something.""

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ""Nothing out there but the woods, love. You‚Äôre safe in here.""

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then‚Äîlight footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it‚Äîthe chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

""Breakfast is ready,"" Mary called softly. ""Come on down now, dear.""

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I‚Äôd have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

""I‚Äôll be right there.""

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy‚Äîlike butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. ""There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?""

""Yeah,"" I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me‚Äîsteak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

""Eat up,"" Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn‚Äôt. The first bite hit my tongue‚Äîsavory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. ""Henry, about my car‚Äî""

""Checked it this morning,"" he cut in. ""Told you it was in bad shape.""

I held his gaze. ""How bad?""

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. ""Oh, honey. Ain‚Äôt no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you.""

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

""I don‚Äôt want to impose,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Maybe I can hike out, find help‚Äî""

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ""Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn‚Äôt last an hour out there.""

Henry grunted in agreement. ""Woods ain‚Äôt kind to folks who don‚Äôt belong.""

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""I need some air,"" I muttered, standing.

Mary‚Äôs smile twitched. ""Of course, dear.""

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth‚Äîsomething faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn‚Äôt just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn‚Äôt call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving‚Äî

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn‚Äôt the first person to end up here.

And if I didn‚Äôt figure out a way to escape, I wouldn‚Äôt be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn‚Äôt just a random patch of earth‚Äîit was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. ""You‚Äôre wandering again, sweetheart.""

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. ""I just‚Ä¶ wanted some air.""

Henry nodded slowly. ""That‚Äôs understandable."" He glanced past me, toward the clearing. ""See anything interesting?""

I forced my face into something neutral. ""Just trees.""

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry‚Äôs expression‚Äîdisappointment? Amusement?

""Good,"" he finally said. ""Best to keep your eyes on what‚Äôs in front of you. Not what‚Äôs behind.""

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. ""Come inside, dear. Supper‚Äôs almost ready.""

I hesitated.

Henry‚Äôs posture didn‚Äôt change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. ""Yeah. Sure.""

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it‚Äîlike the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else‚Äîsomething dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

""Sit,"" Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

""Go on,"" he said. ""You‚Äôve been looking a little thin.""

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. ""That‚Äôs a good boy.""

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle‚Äîevery muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. ""You‚Äôre gonna sleep well tonight,"" he said. ""Body‚Äôs working hard to heal. Needs the rest.""

I nodded. ""I appreciate everything. Really.""

His eyes flickered with amusement. ""We know, son. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking such good care of you.""

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice‚Äîlow, knowing. Henry.

""Sleep tight,"" he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned‚Äînot in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn‚Äôt satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn‚Äôt understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should‚Äîdeeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before‚Äî

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

""Who‚Äôs there?"" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then‚Äî

A whisper, soft as silk.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn‚Äôt mine. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. ""You‚Äôre one of us now.""

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn‚Äôt been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just‚Ä¶ ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

""I told you,"" she said, her voice low and silky. ""You‚Äôd be one of us soon enough.""

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me‚Äîgod, it was unbearable now‚Äîroared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

""I‚Äôm sorry,"" Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. ""You were always meant to be here. We‚Äôve been waiting for you. For so long.""

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn‚Äôt even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

""You‚Äôll understand soon,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll understand what we are. What we do.""

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

""Time to come home,"" she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn‚Äôt control.

And as Mary‚Äôs smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn‚Äôt happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary‚Äôs grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

""You're one of us now,"" she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt comforting. It wasn‚Äôt kind. It was something else entirely. ""You're not going anywhere. Not anymore.""

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn‚Äôt move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn‚Äôt clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she‚Äôd been talking about?

""You‚Äôve been chosen,"" she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. ""We all were. You just didn‚Äôt know it yet.""

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain‚Äîthe hunger‚Äîit was worse than anything I‚Äôd ever felt.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary‚Äôs smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. ""To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We‚Ä¶ evolve.""

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it‚Äîlike sand sifting through my fingers.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary‚Äôs smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. ""It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want. You‚Äôll see. Soon enough.""

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn‚Äôt fall. I didn‚Äôt collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren‚Äôt the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room‚Äîeverything about it‚Äîfelt warped.

""Where are you going?"" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house‚Äîit was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

""Don‚Äôt run,"" he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. ""There‚Äôs no place to go.""

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch‚Äîit was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren‚Äôt mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my face staring back at me. It was‚Ä¶ it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. ""What‚Ä¶ what have you done to me?"" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. ""We‚Äôve made you one of us,"" she said softly. ""You‚Äôre part of our family now. You‚Äôll understand. You‚Äôll feed. And then, when the time is right, you‚Äôll grow just like we did.""

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The hunger inside me‚Äîthe gnawing, terrible need‚Äîit was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I couldn‚Äôt run.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Time doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs all a blur now‚Äîshadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I‚Äôve fed.

It‚Äôs like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I should‚Äôve known when I first walked into that house‚Äîwhen I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There‚Äôs no escape from this. No way to break free of what they‚Äôve turned me into.

The hunger... it‚Äôs worse now. It doesn‚Äôt just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It‚Äôs like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can‚Äôt put it out. I can‚Äôt stop it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was before‚Äîwhat I *was*‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it‚Äôs gone. And in its place, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ *thing*. This creature that doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary‚Äîthey watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know. They know what I‚Äôve become. They know what I‚Äôve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don‚Äôt care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I‚Äôve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed‚Äîthe claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I‚Äôve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I‚Äôm starting to forget.

I‚Äôm forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there‚Äôs one thing I know for certain, deep down‚Äîone truth that‚Äôs still clear in the haze of everything that‚Äôs happened.

I‚Äôll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They‚Äôre familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She‚Äôs always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. ""You‚Äôre ready,"" she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm ready for. But I know I can‚Äôt stop it. The hunger. The change. It‚Äôs already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I‚Äôm not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it‚Äîthe hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that‚Äôs been gnawing at me. It‚Äôs in all of us now. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there‚Äôs something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she whispers, as though she‚Äôs been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it‚Äîlike a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don‚Äôt fight it. I won‚Äôt.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don‚Äôt feel regret.

I don‚Äôt feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there‚Äôs something else‚Äîsomething darker‚Äîbehind her eyes. She knows what‚Äôs coming. She‚Äôs been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that‚Äôs spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I‚Äôm not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It‚Äôs no longer a choice. I don‚Äôt even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They‚Äôre both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know what I‚Äôm about to do. They know what I‚Äôve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there‚Äôs only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It‚Äôs not a big knife, not like the ones I‚Äôve seen on the hooks above, but it‚Äôs sharp, and it‚Äôll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She‚Äôs the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she‚Äôs proud of me. Proud of what I‚Äôve become.

She nods slowly.

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù she says, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who‚Äôs still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn‚Äôt struggle. He doesn‚Äôt try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don‚Äôt hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that‚Äôs been in me for so long.

It‚Äôs warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don‚Äôt even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don‚Äôt even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There‚Äôs just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that‚Äôs taking hold of me.

When it‚Äôs over, I look at Mary again. She‚Äôs still smiling, still standing there, but there‚Äôs something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now,‚Äù she says, her voice softer than it‚Äôs ever been. ""You‚Äôve become just like us. And there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it‚Äôs made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of it matters anymore. I‚Äôve done what I was meant to do. I‚Äôve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It‚Äôs not Henry. Not Mary.

It‚Äôs something in the corner of the room, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn‚Äôt the window itself. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side.

A reflection. But it‚Äôs not my reflection. It‚Äôs... *someone else‚Äôs*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They‚Äôre banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I‚Äôm imagining it. If it‚Äôs just the blood, the hunger, the madness that‚Äôs warped my mind. But then I see it again‚Äîjust for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that. We‚Äôve already chosen you.‚Äù

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can‚Äôt hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary‚Äôs smile widens.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I‚Äôm left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger‚Ä¶

One second, I was gripping the wheel, my headlights cutting through the rain, the next‚ÄîI was spinning. Metal groaned. My tires lifted off the ground. A sickening lurch twisted my stomach as the car flipped, slammed into something hard, and came to a rest upside down. For a moment, all I could hear was my own breath, ragged and sharp in the suffocating silence.

Then came the pain.

A deep, searing ache in my ribs. A hot trickle down my forehead. My fingers trembled as I unbuckled myself, dropping onto the roof of the car. The windshield was shattered, glass scattered like jagged stars in the dim glow of my dying headlights.

I had to get out.

The driver‚Äôs side was crushed against a tree, but the passenger door groaned open with effort. I crawled through, wincing as twigs and stones bit into my palms. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, mist curling through the trees, thick and heavy. My phone was in my jacket pocket, but when I pulled it out, the screen was a spiderweb of cracks. Dead.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

I turned in a slow circle. The road was gone, lost somewhere behind a wall of trees. My car had veered deep into the woods. No headlights. No distant hum of passing cars. Just the chirp of unseen insects and the whisper of the wind. I sucked in a breath, tasting damp earth and the faint copper tang of blood.

I needed help.

A flicker of movement in the distance made me freeze. A shadow shifted between the trees, too far to make out. My pulse kicked up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù My voice was hoarse, raw from the crash.

Silence. Then‚Äî

A lantern flickered to life.

It wasn‚Äôt just a trick of my eyes. There was someone ahead, just beyond the mist. The glow wavered, then started toward me. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunched against the damp leaves.

Relief flooded me. ‚ÄúHey! Thank God! I‚Äî‚Äù

The light stopped.

A figure stepped into view. An old man, hunched beneath a thick coat, his face shadowed beneath the brim of a wide hat. The lantern in his grip swayed gently, casting his features in flickering light. His eyes were pale, almost colorless.

‚ÄúCar crash?‚Äù His voice was a rasp, like dead leaves dragged across stone.

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you‚Äîdo you have a phone? I need to call for help.‚Äù

He tilted his head slightly. ‚ÄúNo phone. But my house ain‚Äôt far.‚Äù

I hesitated. The stranger studied me, unreadable. The woods stretched in every direction, a labyrinth of darkness. If I stayed, I risked hypothermia or worse. If I went‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù

The old man turned without another word, his lantern bobbing as he walked. I followed, my ribs protesting every step. The forest pressed in around us, the trees twisted and gnarled, their bark peeling in thick, curling strips. The farther we went, the quieter it became. The air felt wrong, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name.

After what felt like forever, the house emerged from the fog.

It was old, its wooden walls gray and swollen with age. The porch sagged, the windows dark, empty eyes staring into the night. A weathered wind chime hung from the eaves, silent despite the breeze.

The old man pushed open the door. The hinges creaked like a wounded animal.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù he said, stepping aside.

Everything in me screamed not to. But the cold was sinking into my bones, and I had no other choice.

I stepped inside.

The first night in that house was restless. My body ached from the crash, and every sound in the old wooden structure set my nerves on edge. The walls creaked, the wind howled through unseen cracks, and the heavy scent of cooked meat still lingered in the air.

I barely slept. When I finally drifted off, I had strange dreams‚Äîdark figures loomed over me, whispering in a language I didn‚Äôt understand. A sharp pain jolted me awake, and I found myself gripping my own arm, my nails digging into my skin like claws. My mouth was dry, my stomach twisting with an unfamiliar hunger.

The next morning, Mary greeted me with a wide smile, a steaming plate of eggs, thick slices of ham, and fresh bread already set on the table. ""You need to eat,"" she said, her tone leaving no room for argument.

I hesitated. ""I really appreciate everything you‚Äôve done, but I should probably start figuring out how to get back to town. Maybe there‚Äôs a road nearby? A way I could walk?""

Henry chuckled, settling into his chair across from me. ""Roads around here ain‚Äôt exactly‚Ä¶ reliable. And you‚Äôre still in rough shape. Best to stay put until we can get you properly patched up.""

Something in his voice made me pause. I glanced at Mary, but she was busy pouring coffee into a chipped ceramic mug, her expression unreadable.

I swallowed thickly and took a bite of the ham. It was rich, almost too rich, but I forced myself to chew and swallow. Mary and Henry exchanged a glance.

""Good, good,"" Mary murmured. ""You need your strength.""

I nodded, pretending not to notice the way their eyes lingered on me as I ate.

The day passed slowly. The house had no electricity, no phone, and according to Henry, the nearest town was ""a good forty miles off, through thick forest and rough land."" He offered to take a look at my car later, but his tone was casual‚Äîtoo casual. As if he already knew it wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere.

I explored the house when they weren‚Äôt watching. The rooms were sparse but clean, the furniture handmade and sturdy. In the back room, I found something strange‚Äîhooks hanging from the ceiling, thick ropes coiled neatly beside them. A long wooden table sat in the center, deep grooves cut into its surface. My stomach twisted.

When I turned to leave, Henry was standing in the doorway.

""Looking for something?"" His voice was light, but his eyes were sharp.

I forced a smile. ""Just stretching my legs.""

He nodded slowly. ""Best not to wander too much. This house has a way of‚Ä¶ keeping folks where they belong.""

That night, I locked my bedroom door and wedged a chair under the handle. The hunger in my stomach grew worse, a gnawing emptiness I couldn‚Äôt explain. And as I lay in bed, listening to the distant sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor, I realized I might not be the one in control here.

I might already be trapped.

The morning air was thick with the scent of cooking meat again, but this time, it turned my stomach. I sat up, disoriented, my head pounding. My skin felt clammy, as if I had sweated through the night, but the air in the room was ice cold.

I got up and pressed my ear against the door. Silence. No movement, no voices. But something felt wrong. My mouth was dry, and my limbs ached, but not just from the accident‚Äîsomething deeper, as if my body was starting to betray me.

I hesitated before pulling the chair away from the door and slowly turning the knob. The hallway was empty, the wooden floor creaking under my steps. I moved cautiously, my bare feet light against the boards. As I neared the kitchen, the smell grew stronger, more pungent.

Mary stood at the stove, humming softly. A thick slab of meat sizzled in a cast-iron skillet. She turned as she heard me approach, her smile warm but her eyes cool. ""Mornin‚Äô, dear. You slept in. That‚Äôs good, you need your rest.""

I swallowed hard. ""What time is it?""

""Oh, just past noon,"" she said, flipping the meat with a practiced hand. ""You must‚Äôve been exhausted. Your body needs time to heal.""

My stomach twisted. Noon? I had never been a heavy sleeper, and I could swear I had only dozed off for a few hours.

Henry was nowhere to be seen. I shifted uneasily. ""Where‚Äôs Henry?""

Mary stirred something into a pot, her movements slow, deliberate. ""Tending to some things outside. Won‚Äôt be back for a bit. But don‚Äôt you worry, you‚Äôve got me to keep you company.""

A lump formed in my throat. I forced myself to nod and sat down at the table. A plate was already waiting for me. The same rich, glistening meat. The same thick bread. It looked‚Ä¶ darker today. I poked at it with my fork, my stomach churning.

Mary sat across from me, resting her chin in her palm. ""Go on, eat. You‚Äôre wasting away.""

I cut a piece, my hand trembling slightly. I raised it to my mouth, but the moment it touched my tongue, a metallic taste spread across my palate. My teeth clamped down instinctively, and the texture was wrong‚Äîtoo dense, too fibrous. My throat tightened.

Mary watched me.

I chewed slowly, forcing myself to swallow. My insides recoiled.

""Good, good,"" she said, that same pleased murmur from before. ""You're getting stronger already.""

I pushed my plate away. ""I‚Äî I think I need some air.""

Mary‚Äôs smile faltered for just a fraction of a second, but then she nodded. ""Of course, dear. Just don‚Äôt wander too far.""

I stepped outside, my breath coming fast. The cool air hit me like a wave, and I leaned against the porch railing, trying to steady myself.

Something rustled near the tree line.

I squinted. A figure stood just beyond the clearing, half-hidden by the branches. My heart jumped into my throat. It wasn‚Äôt Henry. It wasn‚Äôt anyone I recognized.

It was watching me.

I took a slow step back, my pulse hammering. The figure tilted its head, just slightly, and then‚Äî

It was gone.

I stumbled backward into the house, slamming the door shut. Mary looked up from her cooking, unfazed. ""Something wrong, dear?""

I shook my head, but the hairs on the back of my neck were still standing. ""No. Just thought I saw something.""

Mary smiled again, but this time, it didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ""Nothing out there but the woods, love. You‚Äôre safe in here.""

Safe.

I swallowed the taste of iron still lingering in my mouth. I wasn‚Äôt so sure about that anymore.

I woke to the sound of soft murmurs just beyond my door. The voices were low, almost melodic, and I couldn‚Äôt make out the words. I held my breath, straining to listen, but the moment I shifted in bed, the murmurs stopped.

Silence.

Then‚Äîlight footsteps retreating down the hall.

I stayed still for a long time, my pulse hammering in my ears. I knew I had locked the door. I knew I had wedged the chair under the handle. And yet, as I turned my head, I saw it‚Äîthe chair was back where it had been before, neatly pushed under the desk.

My stomach turned violently.

I threw off the blanket and went straight to the door. Locked. Bolted from the inside. There was no way anyone could have come in. No way they could have left without me hearing them undoing the lock.

Unless they had never used the door.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and I stepped back from the door as if expecting it to swing open on its own. The air in the room felt heavy, thick with something I couldn‚Äôt name. My breath came faster, shallower. I needed to get out of there.

I crossed to the window, gripping the frame, ready to pry it open‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt budge. The old wood was warped, sealed shut by time and humidity. My fingers dug into the frame as panic started to build.

A knock at the door made me freeze.

""Breakfast is ready,"" Mary called softly. ""Come on down now, dear.""

Her voice was too sweet, too calm. Like she already knew I‚Äôd have no choice but to obey.

I swallowed hard, wiped my damp palms on my jeans, and forced myself to answer.

""I‚Äôll be right there.""

The floorboards creaked as she walked away.

I turned back to the window, staring out into the endless stretch of trees, the thick woods swallowing any sign of the outside world. The thought of walking through them, completely alone, terrified me almost as much as staying here.

Almost.

Still, I needed a plan. Because one way or another, I wasn‚Äôt going to let myself stay trapped.

Not until they decided I was ready.

Not until they decided I was ripe.

I forced myself downstairs, keeping my steps light, controlled. The kitchen smelled rich, heavy‚Äîlike butter, sizzling fat, something seared to perfection. My stomach twisted, uncertain if it was hunger or nausea.

Mary turned as I entered, flashing that too-perfect smile. ""There you are, sweetheart. You slept well, I hope?""

""Yeah,"" I lied, settling into the same chair as yesterday. Henry sat across from me, already chewing through a thick slice of meat. He met my gaze, chewing slowly, deliberately.

Mary set a plate in front of me‚Äîsteak, eggs, roasted potatoes glistening with oil. The steak was thick, nearly bleeding at the center.

""Eat up,"" Henry said, voice low, expectant.

I picked up my fork. My fingers felt stiff, reluctant, like my body knew something I didn‚Äôt. The first bite hit my tongue‚Äîsavory, iron-rich. My stomach clenched as I swallowed, the taste lingering.

It was too rich.

Too familiar.

My hands trembled. I glanced at Mary, but she was watching me, expectant. Henry, too. Like they were waiting for something.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced another bite down, then set my fork aside. ""Henry, about my car‚Äî""

""Checked it this morning,"" he cut in. ""Told you it was in bad shape.""

I held his gaze. ""How bad?""

Mary wiped her hands on her apron. ""Oh, honey. Ain‚Äôt no fixing that thing. Best you stay here, let us take care of you.""

The words twisted in my gut like spoiled food.

""I don‚Äôt want to impose,"" I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Maybe I can hike out, find help‚Äî""

Mary clicked her tongue, shaking her head. ""Oh, sweetheart, you wouldn‚Äôt last an hour out there.""

Henry grunted in agreement. ""Woods ain‚Äôt kind to folks who don‚Äôt belong.""

Something about the way he said it made my skin crawl. I pushed my plate away, appetite gone. ""I need some air,"" I muttered, standing.

Mary‚Äôs smile twitched. ""Of course, dear.""

I stepped onto the porch, inhaling deeply. The air was thick with the scent of trees, damp earth‚Äîsomething faintly metallic underneath it all. The woods stretched endlessly in every direction, no sign of roads, power lines, anything.

The house wasn‚Äôt just remote. It was hidden.

I took a careful step off the porch, then another. The grass was damp beneath my bare feet, the earth oddly soft. I moved slowly, testing them. They didn‚Äôt call out to stop me.

Not yet.

I reached the tree line, heart hammering. If I ran, if I just kept moving‚Äî

Then I saw it.

A clearing, just beyond the trees.

Clothes. Torn, dirt-streaked. A shoe. A dark stain in the grass.

A gut-wrenching realization settled over me.

I wasn‚Äôt the first person to end up here.

And if I didn‚Äôt figure out a way to escape, I wouldn‚Äôt be the last.

I took a step back, breath catching in my throat. The clearing before me wasn‚Äôt just a random patch of earth‚Äîit was a graveyard. A place where something, or someone, had been left to rot.

A twig snapped behind me.

I spun around.

Henry stood on the porch, watching. His face was blank, unreadable, but his hands were tucked deep into his pockets, shoulders relaxed. Like he already knew what I had seen. Like he was waiting for my reaction.

Mary stepped out beside him, wiping her hands on a stained cloth. ""You‚Äôre wandering again, sweetheart.""

Her voice was soft, almost scolding, like I was a child who had strayed too far.

I swallowed hard, trying to force down the panic rising in my chest. ""I just‚Ä¶ wanted some air.""

Henry nodded slowly. ""That‚Äôs understandable."" He glanced past me, toward the clearing. ""See anything interesting?""

I forced my face into something neutral. ""Just trees.""

A pause. A flicker of something in Henry‚Äôs expression‚Äîdisappointment? Amusement?

""Good,"" he finally said. ""Best to keep your eyes on what‚Äôs in front of you. Not what‚Äôs behind.""

The words slithered down my spine like ice water.

Mary smiled. ""Come inside, dear. Supper‚Äôs almost ready.""

I hesitated.

Henry‚Äôs posture didn‚Äôt change, but the air around him did. It thickened, pressed in. The woods felt too quiet, too expectant.

I nodded. ""Yeah. Sure.""

They stepped back, letting me inside first. As I crossed the threshold, I felt it‚Äîlike the house itself inhaled, pulling me in. The walls felt closer, the air heavier, thick with something more than just the smell of cooking meat.

The door shut behind me. The lock clicked.

I was running out of time.

I needed to find a way out.

Fast.

Dinner was already set when I walked into the kitchen. A steaming bowl of stew sat in the center of the table, the deep brown broth swirling with chunks of meat, thick-cut vegetables, and something else‚Äîsomething dark and stringy. The smell was intoxicating, rich, and savory. My stomach twisted in hunger.

""Sit,"" Mary said, already lowering herself into her chair.

Henry followed, slow and deliberate. His eyes never left me as I hesitated by the table.

""Go on,"" he said. ""You‚Äôve been looking a little thin.""

A chill ran through me. My fingers curled against the back of the chair.

I needed to play this carefully. I forced a tired smile and sat down, reaching for the spoon. The first bite slid over my tongue, warm and fatty. My body reacted before my brain could, welcoming the food, the nourishment.

Mary beamed. ""That‚Äôs a good boy.""

I kept eating, slow and measured. Each bite was a battle‚Äîevery muscle in my body screaming at me to stop, every ounce of instinct telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be swallowing this, that it was wrong. But I had to keep them believing I was pliant, that I wasn‚Äôt thinking of running.

Henry finished his bowl before I did, pushing back from the table with a sigh. ""You‚Äôre gonna sleep well tonight,"" he said. ""Body‚Äôs working hard to heal. Needs the rest.""

I nodded. ""I appreciate everything. Really.""

His eyes flickered with amusement. ""We know, son. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre taking such good care of you.""

I forced another smile, then excused myself, saying I was exhausted. I didn‚Äôt look back as I walked down the hall to my room.

Once inside, I locked the door and shoved the chair beneath the handle. My stomach felt full, but the hunger hadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had deepened, turned into something else‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt understand.

I pressed a hand against my abdomen. My skin was warm. Hot, even. My head felt light, my limbs heavy.

Something was wrong.

I stumbled to the window, fumbling with the latch. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers were clumsy, uncoordinated.

Footsteps creaked outside my door.

A voice‚Äîlow, knowing. Henry.

""Sleep tight,"" he murmured.

A shadow passed beneath the doorframe. Then silence.

I sank onto the bed, heart hammering. My vision swam, the edges of the room blurring.

Something was very, very wrong.

And I was running out of time.

The heat in my body only worsened. I lay on the bed, sweating through my clothes, my breath coming in slow, shallow gasps. My stomach churned‚Äînot in pain, but in some awful, insatiable need. The food had filled me, but it hadn‚Äôt satisfied me.

Something inside me was changing.

I pressed a trembling hand against my chest. My heart pounded, faster than it should. My skin felt tight, stretched too thin over my bones. My fingers twitched against the sheets, itching with a restless energy I didn‚Äôt understand.

I needed to get out of here.

I forced myself to sit up, dizziness washing over me. My limbs felt heavier, but I pushed through it. The room was suffocating, the air thick and humid. Every breath felt like I was inhaling something rotten, something spoiled.

The stew.

What the hell had they fed me?

I stumbled toward the window again, gripping the frame with clammy hands. The latch still wouldn‚Äôt budge. My fingers scraped against the wood, my nails digging in deeper than they should‚Äîdeeper than was normal.

I yanked my hands back.

My nails had thickened, darkened.

I swallowed hard. My reflection in the glass was warped in the moonlight, but I swore my pupils were too wide, swallowing up too much of my eyes. My skin looked flushed, almost feverish.

Panic clawed up my throat.

I turned toward the door, my mind racing. I had to get out. I had to find a way to escape before‚Äî

A noise.

Not from the hallway.

From inside my room.

I froze.

Something shifted in the corner, a dark mass huddled near the floor. At first, I thought my fevered mind was playing tricks on me. But then it moved again, slow and deliberate.

Breathing.

Low, raspy.

I wasn‚Äôt alone.

I reached blindly for anything I could use as a weapon. My fingers closed around the metal lamp on the nightstand. I yanked it free, gripping it tight as I took a slow step forward.

""Who‚Äôs there?"" My voice came out hoarse, strained.

The breathing stopped.

Then‚Äî

A whisper, soft as silk.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

A jolt of terror shot through me.

I swung the lamp.

It passed through empty air.

The shadow was gone.

Only the whisper remained, curling around my skull, burrowing deep into my bones.

I was changing.

And I didn‚Äôt know if I could stop it.

I dropped the lamp, my hand trembling as I backed into the corner of the room. My pulse raced in my ears, drowning out all sound except the rush of blood through my veins. The whisper lingered in my mind, the words curling like smoke, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

""You‚Äôre almost ready.""

For what? What did that mean? I wanted to scream, to call for help, but my throat was dry, tight, as if something inside me had already begun to choke the life out of my voice.

The room felt colder now. The air thick, pressing down on me like a weight. I could hear my breath, shallow and uneven, as I fought to keep control. The walls felt like they were closing in, the edges of the room bending and warping as though reality itself was starting to splinter.

I glanced back at the window, but the reflection that stared back at me wasn‚Äôt mine. It was‚Ä¶ wrong. The eyes in the glass were too wide, too dark. A twisted version of myself, staring back in silence.

A low chuckle echoed in the room.

I spun around, but there was no one there.

My heart thundered in my chest. I needed to get out of this place. I needed to escape, but every step I took toward the door felt heavier, more laborious. The hunger inside me pulsed like a heartbeat, an insistent throb that only grew worse the more I tried to ignore it.

The whisper came again, clearer this time. ""You‚Äôre one of us now.""

I gripped the doorknob, forcing it open, but the door wouldn‚Äôt budge. It was as if something on the other side was holding it shut, a force I couldn‚Äôt see but could feel, pressing against the wood, keeping me trapped inside.

I looked around the room in a panic. There had to be a way out. There had to be something I could do to get free.

My eyes landed on the table in the corner, the one with the deep grooves etched into its surface. My breath caught in my throat.

The hooks.

The ropes.

They hadn‚Äôt been there when I first explored the room, had they? Or had I just‚Ä¶ ignored them?

I stepped toward the table, unable to look away from the crude implements. The air in the room seemed to thicken, pressing against my chest with a sickening heaviness.

I had to get out.

But where could I go? What was happening to me?

A sound behind me made me spin around.

It was Mary.

She stood in the doorway, her eyes wide, her lips curling into a smile that was far too sweet, far too unnatural.

""I told you,"" she said, her voice low and silky. ""You‚Äôd be one of us soon enough.""

I took a step back, fear rising in my chest, but something in her gaze stopped me. Her eyes, wide and unblinking, held me in place, like a predator luring its prey. My body trembled, and the hunger inside me‚Äîgod, it was unbearable now‚Äîroared to life, deep in my gut.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

""I‚Äôm sorry,"" Mary continued, her voice soothing, but her words only twisted deeper inside my mind. ""You were always meant to be here. We‚Äôve been waiting for you. For so long.""

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I couldn‚Äôt think. It was like her voice had wrapped around my brain, pulling me into some dark, suffocating place where escape wasn‚Äôt even possible. I wanted to scream. I needed to scream.

But I couldn‚Äôt.

""You‚Äôll understand soon,"" she said. ""You‚Äôll understand what we are. What we do.""

I tried to shake my head, tried to fight the pull of her words, but it was like they were sinking into my soul, rooting me to the spot. My body trembled, and I could feel the change, the shift in me, growing stronger, harder to resist.

The hunger. It was unbearable.

Mary stepped forward, her hand reaching out toward me. I flinched, instinctively stepping back, but the movement was too slow. Too late.

Her hand landed on my arm, and the heat that shot through my skin was unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. It was fire and ice, pain and pleasure, all tangled into one. I gasped, my breath hitching, but it didn‚Äôt matter. Her touch burned through me, through everything I was.

""Time to come home,"" she whispered.

Her grip tightened.

And I felt it. The change. It spread like wildfire, racing through my veins, crawling under my skin. My body, my soul, everything about me was shifting, turning into something else.

Something I couldn‚Äôt control.

And as Mary‚Äôs smile stretched wider, as her grip tightened further, I realized there was no escape. There had never been.

I was becoming part of this twisted thing.

Part of whatever they were.

And it was too late to turn back now.

The transformation didn‚Äôt happen all at once. It was slow, like a creeping vine, winding around my body and squeezing tighter with each passing second. The hunger, it gnawed at me from the inside, a constant presence now. Every movement felt unnatural, every breath too shallow.

Mary‚Äôs grip on my arm was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt the burning heat anymore. It had become something else. Something cold. It seeped into my skin, down into my bones, until I felt like I was nothing but a shell of who I used to be.

""You're one of us now,"" she whispered again, her voice low and hypnotic. She smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt comforting. It wasn‚Äôt kind. It was something else entirely. ""You're not going anywhere. Not anymore.""

I wanted to scream, to pull away, but my body felt alien to me now. I couldn‚Äôt move the way I used to. My legs felt stiff, my arms heavy. I tried to lift them, tried to break free of her grasp, but it was as if my body was no longer mine to control. My fingers curled involuntarily, pressing against the cold surface of the floor beneath me.

There was no escape. Not from the house, and not from whatever I was becoming.

I looked at her, tried to focus on her face, but everything seemed blurry now. My vision flickered, shifting in and out of focus. My thoughts were muddled, swirling in a fog I couldn‚Äôt clear. Was this what she meant? Was this the change she‚Äôd been talking about?

""You‚Äôve been chosen,"" she continued, her tone almost gentle now, as if trying to soothe me. ""We all were. You just didn‚Äôt know it yet.""

Her words echoed in my head, repeating over and over, twisting around my mind until I could barely hear anything else. My mouth was dry, my heart pounding in my chest, but the pain‚Äîthe hunger‚Äîit was worse than anything I‚Äôd ever felt.

‚ÄúChosen for what?‚Äù I managed to croak, my voice thin, almost foreign to my ears.

Mary‚Äôs smile deepened, and she leaned in closer, so close I could feel the warmth of her breath against my skin. ""To be part of something bigger. We feed, we grow stronger. We‚Ä¶ evolve.""

Evolve? What was she talking about?

Something inside me screamed. I tried to resist, tried to hold on to the last shred of who I was, but it was slipping away. I could feel it‚Äîlike sand sifting through my fingers.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù I whispered, barely recognizing my own voice.

Mary‚Äôs smile never wavered. She let go of my arm, but the coldness lingered, spreading through me like poison. ""It doesn‚Äôt matter what you want. You‚Äôll see. Soon enough.""

I staggered back, my legs unsteady, but I didn‚Äôt fall. I didn‚Äôt collapse. I had to focus. I had to get out. There had to be some way out of this.

I took a few shaky steps, my body still stiff and unresponsive, but something pulled at me. Something in the house. It was like a presence, a dark weight pressing down on me, making it harder to think, to move. I was trapped. Trapped in my own body. Trapped in this place.

I glanced around the room, trying to find an exit. There had to be a door, a window, something. But the walls, they weren‚Äôt the same. The edges were soft, shifting, and the room‚Äîeverything about it‚Äîfelt warped.

""Where are you going?"" Mary asked, her voice suddenly sharp, laced with something that made my skin crawl.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

I pushed forward, dragging my legs like they were made of lead. My breath was coming faster now, my heart pounding in my chest. But there was no escape. No way out. The house‚Äîit was alive, and I was becoming part of it. I was becoming part of whatever this was.

Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. Heavy, slow, deliberate. I didn‚Äôt turn around. I couldn‚Äôt. It was as if I already knew what was coming. I had known, deep down, all along.

The hunger.

The change.

It was all consuming.

I took another step, another, but the door was still too far. I wasn‚Äôt going to make it. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough.

A hand touched my shoulder.

I froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Mary this time. It was Henry. His face was too calm, too still, like he knew exactly what was happening, exactly what I was becoming.

""Don‚Äôt run,"" he said softly, his voice almost a whisper. ""There‚Äôs no place to go.""

I wanted to push him away. I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. My throat felt like it was closing up, suffocating me. His touch‚Äîit was cold, too cold.

I looked down at my hands, but they weren‚Äôt mine anymore. My fingers had elongated, the nails sharp and twisted, like claws. My skin, pale and bruised, stretched over bones that felt thinner, more fragile than they had ever been before.

I didn‚Äôt recognize the reflection in the window anymore. It wasn‚Äôt my face staring back at me. It was‚Ä¶ it was something else. Something hollow. Something hungry.

I staggered back, my breath coming in ragged gasps. ""What‚Ä¶ what have you done to me?"" I choked out, my voice breaking.

Mary stepped forward, her hands gentle on my shoulders. ""We‚Äôve made you one of us,"" she said softly. ""You‚Äôre part of our family now. You‚Äôll understand. You‚Äôll feed. And then, when the time is right, you‚Äôll grow just like we did.""

I felt something inside me snap. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. The hunger inside me‚Äîthe gnawing, terrible need‚Äîit was unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt fight it. I couldn‚Äôt run.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was screaming, or if the sound was coming from somewhere else entirely. But the last thing I saw before the world went black was Henry and Mary, standing together, watching me. Waiting for me.

And I knew, deep down, that I had already become something else. I had already become a part of them.

And there was no turning back now.

I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here. Time doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs all a blur now‚Äîshadows and whispers, hunger and darkness. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times I've given in. How many times I‚Äôve fed.

It‚Äôs like waking up in a nightmare that never ends.

I should‚Äôve seen it coming. I should‚Äôve known when I first walked into that house‚Äîwhen I first smelled the meat on the air, when I first saw the hooks, the ropes. They were all signs. Signs I ignored, because I thought I was in control, thought I could escape.

But I was never meant to escape.

There‚Äôs no escape from this. No way to break free of what they‚Äôve turned me into.

The hunger... it‚Äôs worse now. It doesn‚Äôt just gnaw at me anymore; it *devours* me. I can feel it in my chest, in my limbs, deep in my bones, as if every part of me is starved for something I can never get enough of.

It‚Äôs like a fire inside me, a wildfire that consumes everything in its path, but I can‚Äôt put it out. I can‚Äôt stop it.

I don‚Äôt know what I was before‚Äîwhat I *was*‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all slipping away. Everything that made me human, everything that kept me tethered to the world outside, it‚Äôs gone. And in its place, there‚Äôs this‚Ä¶ *thing*. This creature that doesn‚Äôt feel anything anymore. No warmth. No compassion. Just hunger.

The others, Henry and Mary‚Äîthey watch me now. They watch me, but they never speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know. They know what I‚Äôve become. They know what I‚Äôve done. I can feel their eyes on me when I feed. I can feel them waiting for me to take that final step. To finally, fully surrender to what I am.

They don‚Äôt care about the person I was. They never did. They only care about the monster I‚Äôve become. A monster like them.

There are no mirrors here. No windows. No reflection to remind me of who I used to be. I only see the shadows. Only see the way my hands have changed‚Äîthe claws, the pale skin, the hollow eyes. The way my hunger never stops. The way I‚Äôve learned to feed without thought. Without remorse.

The worst part? I‚Äôm starting to forget.

I‚Äôm forgetting what it was like to be me.

But there‚Äôs one thing I know for certain, deep down‚Äîone truth that‚Äôs still clear in the haze of everything that‚Äôs happened.

I‚Äôll never leave this place. Not alive. And not the way I was before.

I hear footsteps now. They‚Äôre familiar. Soft. Slow. Mary. She‚Äôs always there. Always watching.

She comes closer, her voice low, soft like the wind. ""You‚Äôre ready,"" she says, and I feel the words settle deep inside me, like a mark, an irreversible change.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm ready for. But I know I can‚Äôt stop it. The hunger. The change. It‚Äôs already too far gone.

The house feels different now. Not just the walls, or the furniture, or the rooms. *I* feel different. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm still the same person who stumbled into this place, who crashed that car, who thought she could escape.

But I know one thing. I‚Äôm not scared anymore.

The fear is gone, replaced by something darker, something deeper. Something primal.

I turn to face Mary, and for the first time since I got here, I look at her, really look at her, and I see it‚Äîthe hunger in her eyes, the same hunger that‚Äôs been gnawing at me. It‚Äôs in all of us now. It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve become. What we always were meant to be.

Her smile is soft, but there‚Äôs something in it now, something that makes me feel... cold.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time,‚Äù she whispers, as though she‚Äôs been waiting for this moment.

The hunger surges through me again, stronger this time. I can feel it‚Äîlike a call. The others are waiting. They always are.

And for the first time, I *understand*. I don‚Äôt fight it. I won‚Äôt.

I walk with her down the hall, past the tables, the hooks, the ropes. Down into the room where we do what we do best. Where we feed.

And as I sit down, as I begin, I don‚Äôt feel regret.

I don‚Äôt feel fear.

I feel hunger.

And I know, deep inside me, that I will never be the same again.

The room is colder now. The air is thick with anticipation, and the shadows seem to stretch longer with each passing second. Mary stands at the edge of the table, her face half-lit by the dim flicker of a single candle. Her smile is all too knowing, but there‚Äôs something else‚Äîsomething darker‚Äîbehind her eyes. She knows what‚Äôs coming. She‚Äôs been waiting for this. And so have I.

The hunger is unbearable now. It's like a fire that‚Äôs spread through my chest, down into my stomach, through my veins. It burns with a need that nothing can satisfy. Not food. Not water. Only *this*.

I‚Äôm not just hungry anymore. I *crave* this. I need it. The blood. The meat. The taste of it all.

It‚Äôs no longer a choice. I don‚Äôt even want to fight it.

I look around the room, at the two figures bound to the chairs across from me. Henry and Mary. They‚Äôre both silent, staring at me with cold, unwavering eyes. They don‚Äôt speak. They don‚Äôt need to. They know what I‚Äôm about to do. They know what I‚Äôve become.

And they *want* me to do it.

The chair creaks as I sit down at the table, a table that seems to stretch forever, as if it could hold an endless amount of meat, of *life* to consume. But there‚Äôs only one thing I need. Only one thing that will quiet the gnawing inside me.

I take a deep breath. My hands shake as I pick up the knife. It‚Äôs not a big knife, not like the ones I‚Äôve seen on the hooks above, but it‚Äôs sharp, and it‚Äôll do the job.

I look at Mary first. She‚Äôs the one who made this happen. The one who *invited* me into this hellhole. But her smile is soft, like she‚Äôs proud of me. Proud of what I‚Äôve become.

She nods slowly.

‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù she says, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

And I am. Ready to feed.

I turn to Henry, who‚Äôs still watching me with those empty eyes. His jaw is clenched, and his body tenses as I approach, but he doesn‚Äôt struggle. He doesn‚Äôt try to run.

He knows, too.

I raise the knife.

His mouth opens, but no words come out. Only a low, guttural sound, something between a gasp and a sob, and then silence.

I don‚Äôt hesitate. I drive the knife into his chest, and the blood bursts forth in a hot, slick stream. The taste is instant, sharp, metallic. It fills my mouth, filling the ache that‚Äôs been in me for so long.

It‚Äôs warm. So warm.

I tear into him, tearing his flesh apart, chewing, swallowing. I can‚Äôt stop. I won‚Äôt stop. The hunger is too strong, too consuming. And when I finish with him, I don‚Äôt even feel full. I feel *empty*.

I don‚Äôt even remember how long it takes. Hours? Minutes? Time is meaningless here. There‚Äôs just the hunger, and the taste, and the madness that‚Äôs taking hold of me.

When it‚Äôs over, I look at Mary again. She‚Äôs still smiling, still standing there, but there‚Äôs something else in her eyes now. A flicker of something darker, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of us now,‚Äù she says, her voice softer than it‚Äôs ever been. ""You‚Äôve become just like us. And there‚Äôs no turning back.‚Äù

I stand up, my legs unsteady, my body feeling like it‚Äôs made of lead. The blood coats my hands, my face, my clothes. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. None of it matters anymore. I‚Äôve done what I was meant to do. I‚Äôve fed.

But as I start to turn away, something catches my eye.

It‚Äôs not Henry. Not Mary.

It‚Äôs something in the corner of the room, something that wasn‚Äôt there before.

A window.

A small, cracked window, barely big enough for a person to fit through. But what catches my attention isn‚Äôt the window itself. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side.

A reflection. But it‚Äôs not my reflection. It‚Äôs... *someone else‚Äôs*.

The person in the reflection looks exactly like me, but their eyes are wide, frantic, and full of terror. They‚Äôre banging on the glass, as if trying to break through, but the window is sealed shut.

I blink. The reflection vanishes.

For a moment, I wonder if I‚Äôm imagining it. If it‚Äôs just the blood, the hunger, the madness that‚Äôs warped my mind. But then I see it again‚Äîjust for a second. A face in the window, looking out from the other side, staring at me with wide, desperate eyes.

I stumble backward, my heart racing. What the hell is going on?

Mary steps forward, her footsteps almost silent, and places a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it,‚Äù she says softly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to worry about that. We‚Äôve already chosen you.‚Äù

I turn to face her, but the reflection is still there, waiting, pressing against the glass, screaming. But I can‚Äôt hear the sound. The room is silent except for my own breathing.

Mary‚Äôs smile widens.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand soon enough.‚Äù

And as I stand there, staring at the face in the window, I feel something cold wrap around my chest. Something tightening, pulling me deeper into the darkness of this house. Into the hunger. Into this never-ending nightmare.

But before I can move, before I can scream, the door slams shut. And I‚Äôm left standing alone in the room with the blood on my hands, and the hunger‚Ä¶

1jp6pzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jp6pzo/help_with_a_small_burn_24f/,Help with a small burn (24f),"Hi!

So I burned my hand 2 days ago by spilling hot coffee on it. While I have gotten burns before from working in kitchens, this is the worst one I've had so I'm a bit confused on how I should be taking care of it. I'm not sure what type it is (I'm thrown off by the pale yellowish color) or if I should keep it exposed or not, or what I should do about showering. I have burn cream I have been using. It's swollen a little bit in the last couple of hours, not enough to be super noticeable but it feels stiff. It doesn't hurt unless something comes in contact, like my sleeve.

I'm also studying abroad in Italy right now and this week my schedule is so tight that I'm not sure I'd be able to make it to a doctor. I also don't speak Italian.

I like Carmel Valley but am a little bit bored of it, I love being near the coast and being able to surf, cycle etc along the 101 is amazing though. My ideal neighborhood is Encinitas or Cardiff but the commute would be a little rough for me when I need to go further south.  I was wondering what neighborhoods people recommend? Looking for a slightly more urban feel, would love to be able to wake up and walk to a coffee shop nearby or local restaurants. At the same time I work odd hours, long shifts (12h) and being close to work and being in a safe neighborhood is also important, I like going to North Park/Hillcrest for instance but not sure I'd like living there for those reasons.

Any Other Suggestions?,"I booked a solo trip to China for later this year, and I have roughly 7 months to learn as much Mandarin as possible. It is a life challenge for me to learn this language, and now that I've finally booked a trip there, I have a firm reason to learn the language. And above all be motivated to learn it.

I've downloaded HelloChinese, Coffee Break Chinese, Pleco, and Duolingo so far. I am also interested in Yoyo Chinese on YouTube, and I just enrolled myself in an 8-week beginner level course starting next Wednesday (each session will last 1 hour and 45 minutes). I am eager to learn, and am willing to use all the resoures at my disposal.

Do you recommend any other resources that were helpful to you while learning the language? Any practical tips/recommendations?

I don't have a specific goal in mind, but a more general one. If I can get to HSK 3 in 7 months then I will be happy. Honestly, if I am able to simply function while ordering food, asking for directions, and the like, then that will make me happy. 

My ultimate goal is to be fluent in the language, and I have to start somewhere. I just started yesterday, and am already enjoying learning the basics.

We met for coffee last weekend and 5 hours later, we said we'd do it again sometime. Our break up wasn't nasty. We were just young and needed to explore. 

He has now asked me on an actual dinner date this weekend. 

I'm having deja vu lol. It feels like the first time he asked and he instantly won me over by bringing me something I had said I liked to the date. 

I've spent my life since with men who treated me poorly, lied to me, cheated on me, and just never took the initiative to plan or ask for dates, nevermind listening when I talked or remembering anything. Sure, they paid when we did go out but that wasn't what mattered at all. 

How do I temper my expectations that he is still the same guy he was 20 years ago? I have to relearn who he is, but i'm also hoping he's the same impressive charmer he was back then, atleast when it came to dates. 

I'm also trying to soothe my anxiety, because he's not a big texter. I'm used to clingy and anxious men texting me all the time, in between dates, etc. This guy is more text out of necessity and to make plans, thats it. So we'll go days without talking and i'm not used to it, even though we didn't have texting 20 years ago.

Let‚Äôs be honest. **Weight loss after 40** hits different. The fat‚Äôs clingy, the stress is clingier, and your willpower evaporates somewhere between coffee and 3 PM cravings.

If you're tired of spinning your wheels while your belly spins out of control, you're not alone. A slow metabolism and stress often tag-team your progress and your mood.

[Progenifix](https://theworldhealth.org/progenifix-official) offers a different kind of help ‚Äî one based on **mushroom pills for metabolism boost**, not mystery powder and shame.

============

>üôè **To say thanks** for visiting our Sub, here's a **free** gift : ""**3-Day Super Smoothie Plan**"" - 100% complete human nutrition over a 3 day cycle ... [Download Here](https://theworldhealth.org/maqui/lp/three-day/)  üôè

# üì¶ Product Overview

**Product Name:** Progenifix  
**Category:** Supplements ‚Üí Weight Loss  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.6/5

# üçÑ What Is Progenifix?

**Progenifix** is a plant-based supplement that uses **medicinal mushrooms for weight management**. Its big pitch? Less stress = less fat.

Instead of amping you up with stimulants, it helps lower cortisol so your body can focus on burning fat ‚Äî especially around the belly.

That‚Äôs what makes it feel more like a **holistic weight loss remedy** than a crash diet in capsule form. It‚Äôs gentle but surprisingly effective.

# üî¨ How Does Progenifix Work?

The science behind this isn't rocket fuel ‚Äî it‚Äôs stress, cortisol, and your body saying *‚Äúwe need a break.‚Äù*

The formula works as a **cortisol lowering supplement for belly fat**, helping your body shed stubborn weight without the chaos of stimulant-driven pills.

Many users see it as one of the better **natural ways to reduce cortisol**, especially those who‚Äôve struggled with the **stress and weight gain connection**.

So if you've wondered **how to lose weight without stimulants**, this route might be your best bet.

Plus, it feels safer than most **weight loss supplements without caffeine or stimulants** floating around online.

# üçÑ Key Ingredients Breakdown

# Lion‚Äôs Mane

Known for **focus and appetite balance**, [this shaggy mushroom](https://theworldhealth.org/progenifix-official) packs a punch. **Lion‚Äôs mane for appetite control** has been known about for many years and this formula uses it to full effect.

# Chaga

Chaga‚Äôs here for its **anti-inflammatory and sugar-balancing effects**. Fans often mention the **chaga benefits for weight loss** without jitters.

# Cordyceps

This little powerhouse pulls double duty: increased stamina + better fat burn = legit **cordyceps energy and fat loss**.

# White Button Mushroom

Often overlooked, this one brings down fat storage, making **white button mushroom supplement users** feel lighter and more energized.

Together, these four make up a smart, clean **fat-burning mushroom complex**.

And yes, they‚Äôre all part of a well-crafted **mushroom extract for fat metabolism** solution that doesn‚Äôt feel sketchy.

Ever asked, **do lion‚Äôs mane and chaga help with fat loss?** This blend says yes ‚Äî with receipts.

# üë©‚Äçü¶≥ Vanessa‚Äôs Experience with Progenifix

Vanessa ‚Äî my cousin‚Äôs partner of 14 years ‚Äî has always been the kind of person who radiates calm.

She teaches yoga on the weekends, eats intuitively, and genuinely enjoys things like fermented beet kraut and lemon balm tea.

But over the past year, she noticed something off: her belly was puffier, her energy more unpredictable, and her usually grounded vibe felt more like a nervous hum.

‚ÄúI felt like I was inflating emotionally and physically,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt overeating, I wasn‚Äôt being lazy ‚Äî I just felt heavy. In my body and in my head.‚Äù

She [gave Progenifix a try](https://theworldhealth.org/progenifix-official) mostly because the ingredients aligned with her interest in **adaptogenic mushrooms**. Within two weeks, she noticed her sleep improved. By the fourth week, the stubborn bloat she‚Äôd been carrying started to ease up.

She wasn‚Äôt obsessively weighing herself, but she *felt* lighter ‚Äî in her joints, her clothes, and her general mood.

The biggest shift? Her cravings dialed down without any force. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt stress-snacking on roasted chickpeas at 10 p.m. anymore,‚Äù she laughed.

Her only complaint was that on a couple of mornings she forgot to take the capsule and didn‚Äôt love that it seemed to work best **taken consistently** on an empty stomach. Not a deal-breaker, just something to get used to.

She‚Äôs still taking it now, nearly three months in ‚Äî not because she‚Äôs chasing skinny, but because, in her words, ‚Äúit makes me feel more like myself.‚Äù

# üß† NEW: Why Adaptogens Work for Fat Loss

# Reverse Osmosis Whole House Water Filter 2025: Top 5 Systems Compared & Reviewed

Are you searching for the ultimate solution to achieve‚Å£ pristine, healthy water throughout your home? in 2025, the demand for comprehensive water filtration has never‚Å§ been higher, and ‚Å§a‚Å§ *reverse osmosis water filter whole house* system is emerging as a frontrunner. This comprehensive guide ‚Å§explores the top 5 whole house reverse osmosis ‚Å¢systems, offering an in-depth comparison and review to help you make an informed decision. Whether you're a homeowner battling hard ‚Å§water,a business owner needing consistent water quality,or a well owner concerned about contaminants,understanding‚Äå your options is crucial.This is your guide to understanding these often complex processes.

## Why Choose a Whole house Reverse Osmosis System?

The allure of ‚Å§a *whole home reverse osmosis‚Å¢ system* lies in its ability to deliver purified water to‚Äå every tap in your house.‚Äå Unlike point-of-use filters, a reverse‚Äå osmosis water purifier ‚Äåfor home addresses water quality issues at the point of entry, ensuring that your drinking water is safe, your showers are refreshing, and your appliances are protected from scale buildup. But with so many options available, how do you choose the *best whole house ro system* for your needs?

Consider the benefits:

*   **Comprehensive‚Äå Contaminant Removal:** Reverse osmosis effectively‚Äç removes a wide range of contaminants, including sediment, chlorine, heavy ‚Äãmetals, bacteria, ‚Å£and viruses.*   **Whole-Home Protection:** Extends the lifespan of ‚Å£your appliances by preventing scale‚Äã buildup caused by ‚Äçhard water. Protects plumbing from unwanted impurities.
   **Improved Water Quality:** enjoy better-tasting,‚Äç odor-free water for drinking, cooking, and ‚Äçbathing.
   **Health Benefits:** reduces‚Äå exposure to harmful contaminants that can pose health ‚Å§risks.## Understanding ‚Å¢Reverse Osmosis: The Science Behind Clean Water

Reverse osmosis (RO) ‚Äçis a ‚Å£water purification process that utilizes ‚Å¢a semi-permeable ‚Äãmembrane to‚Å¢ remove‚Äå ions,‚Å§ molecules, and larger particles from drinking water. Water ‚Äãpressure forces water through the *membrane filtration* system, leaving contaminants behind. This process results in highly purified water.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

*   **pre-filters:** remove sediment,chlorine,and other large particles to protect the RO membrane.‚Äã Often uses *pre filters to catch larger ‚Å£sediment.
   **RO Membrane:** The heart of the system, responsible for removing dissolved solids, chemicals, and microorganisms. often measures *TDS reduction* to measure contaminant ‚Å¢filtering capabilities.
*   **Post-filters:** Polish the‚Äã water after RO filtration, removing any remaining tastes‚Å£ or odors. Uses *post‚Äå filters to remove ‚Å£odors.
   **Water Tank:** Stores the purified‚Å£ water for‚Å§ on-demand use.
*   **Permeate ‚ÄåPump:** ‚Äç Increases water‚Å§ pressure to improve‚Äå efficiency and reduce water waste (common in some advanced ‚Å¢systems).Improves *water pressure.

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again.

1jp6fwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jp6fwh/30_m4a_online_i_have_priorities_that_id_love_you/,30 [M4A] Online - I have priorities that I'd love you to distract me from,"Good morning/afternoon/evening to you wherever you are,

I'm in a predicament that I usually find myself in 2 or 3 times a year. I've a lecture to prepare for this week and next week to be given to a room of curious trainees and experts. One of the types where you present new findings in your field and then critique the studies and methods followed by the worst part: the 5-10 minutes of questions at the end from all the experts in the room.

It's a positive environment and I value their questions and comments, but it just puts me on edge, understandably.

So, I came here looking for someone to put a little dopamine into my reward center - it'd be nice to have a bit of a distraction and get to know a new friend while I chip away at this lecture. What am I looking for? Comfy vibes, like sitting with a friend at a nice cafe while that one song by Nora Jones plays in the background and not too loudly - I don't even like that song much, but it is nice. Jokes, banter, rants - everything is invited.

I find things begin best with a question a lot of times, so here's a few for you to pick from:

1. How would you describe your perfect meal?  
2. How do you take your coffee? If you don't like coffee, what beverage can I grab for you?  
3. Do you think some animals do know how to talk and communicate with us, they've just chosen not to? Maybe because they want to avoid paying taxes or something.

If you've made it this far, here's a little more about me:  
I'm Jay, 30, from Texas. I work as a physician (fun fact: lecture as mentioned above is going to be to a room full of other physicians who are also evaluating me). My dream job was to be an astronaut, I love aviation and space, I think I could find something cute about any animal, and overall I think laughing your way through most situations is an ideal strategy.

I look forward to hearing from ya.

1jp6fk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorsOfIWW/comments/1jp6fk4/boston_to_milwaukee_part_ii/,Boston To Milwaukee Part II,"Hanging out with a few green party members and one of them is a wobbly. We both work in the same industry on the same property. Thought that was the greatest day of my life. I thought I struck gold. They're not active in IWW. I'd like to meet more IWW members. The green party wob tells me I should meet what seems like the cult leader of the Milwaukee IWW. Tell them I have extensive experience in marketing, business, economics, and labor organizing. They basically high five me and rush me out of the door. Didn't get a good vibe from them. But I'm trying to take things slow.

Months later, I meet another 'member' of Milwaukee IWW at a community event in my new neighborhood. I'VE STRUCK GOLD AGAIN! They're outgoing, friendly, brave and inclusive. We have a blast all of the time!! Greatest time of my life. Finally, a friend in the industrial union universe to be open about the same ideas. Felt like liberation. A friend to talk to.

I help canvas all of Milwaukee for their Mildred Harnack Celebration. I meet like 20 IWW members. I give all of them my phone number and a homemade industrial unionism sticker I made. No one ever reaches out.

A few months go by. Non-stop awesome solidarity activities between the 'member' and I. I find out they're going through serious problems with the ""cult leader"" of Milwaukee IWW but everything is civil on the surface. Nonetheless, they eventually tell me I need to rejoin IWW. I explain to them that it doesn't seem like a good idea. In fact I highly doubt anything good will come of it. I just want to make friends and organically find my spot in Milwaukee. Some time passes. Positivity is building. The Milwaukee IWW seems like it's going well.

The 'member' says I should talk to the 'cult leader' again. So I do. I tell them about the damage from Boston. They explain it's all good and I should try. So I try again.

I'm added to the sub stack. I mention that I will be attending a trans femm skateboard event with a ton of homemade IWW stickers. I'm instantly reprimanded for making IWW stickers without permission and for using the IWW sub stack to reach out to people. I'm given an email to contact for events. I email the address, never got a reply. I'm also thoroughly questioned about my intentions. I simply wanted to go skateboarding in my neighborhood and slap stickers. It's not that complex. My wobbly colleague tells me to ignore the email and not to answer that. My wobbly colleague also has been in trouble with IWW too. I don't know their story. They never told me.

They assign me a delegate. The delegate instantly wants me to obey they're commands. I explain to them that I am a grow adult with a vibrant work history in different fields and an education in studying administration, pensions, unions, and coops. I'd love to help them, support them, and form a bond before I blindly take commands. They tell me that my experience means nothing and they no longer want to be my delegate and they'll re assign me. That was hurtful. I only met them two times, for a total of two hours, before they condemned me.

I tell my wobbly 'member' friend, that I need to quit IWW. They tell me to stay strong. Rise above it all. So, I stay in the group. Don't have any form of communication with any of them. A few months go by. I email asking if Im getting a new delegate. No answer.

Another month goes by, I find the courage to attend a meeting. I say nothing. No one says anything to me. Meeting ends. I walk out. That's all. Maybe just maybe I can hold on.

One of the old school Milwaukee Wobblies reach out to me. We form a good relationship, talking about labor history, meeting for coffee. I'VE STRUCK GOLD THREE TIMES! Time of my life. Loving everything.  We talk about David Rovics. Neither one of us have any idea David Rovics talked to a right winger ages ago. Which means nothing.

I tell a local folk artist about David Rovics. The folk artist wants to organize a show with Rovics. I tell the old school wobbly. Him and the 'member' tell the musical member of IWW about it. I did not want any input from the musical member of IWW. The music member reaches out to me like im garbage. They want nothing to do with it, they're condescending, rude and treat me like a sub human. I wasn't organizing this event. Also their response was brutal in regards to David Rovics being a lifelong IWW member. Rovics talked to an old friend who is now a hard right winger on a podcast platform with 10 views. No one cares.

To wrap this up. I started this community 'sub reddit' because everywhere I go I meet ex-wobblies who have the same feelings as me. In Boston there is an entire group who exited the IWW. Maybe 20 members. That's sad.

When I reached out to Immanuel Ness, the renowned left wing author on labor economics he said, ""I‚Äôm glad you like the book, and I share your concern with the IWW today.¬† In my view it is more of a¬†club¬†that sells souvenirs to middle class fans of the erstwhile era than a bona fide political organization.¬† But the activities of worker self-organization continue in many workplaces throughout the world.¬† I‚Äôm writing a new book on syndicalism and rank-and-file organizing among precarious workers. Best wishes with your studies of syndicalism.""

I've been there, staring at my calendar like it's some sort of cryptic puzzle. But guess what? I found a way to *cut the noise* and reclaim my time. And no, it doesn't involve those impossible-to-stick-to productivity fads. Spoiler: It saved me 10 hours a week. üïë‚ú®

Picture this: you wake up, grab your coffee, and feel like you‚Äôre *finally* in control. Sounds dreamy, right? Well, that's how I feel now, thanks to a combo of **daily rituals** and a sprinkle of **time blocking.** Let's dive in.

### **Daily Rituals: Your Secret Superpower**

- **Start Small:** I began with a simple morning ritual: 10 minutes of stretching and 5 minutes sipping coffee, just focusing on breathing. No phone, no news. It was *weirdly* relaxing. No more waking up and immediately scrolling through my phone like a zombie. 
- **Consistency Beats Perfection:** It's not about having a three-hour routine, but something sustainable. Yours could be journaling, reading a few pages of a book, or just sitting in silence. **What‚Äôs one habit you could commit to every day?** ü§î

### **Time Blocking: Organizing with Intention**

- **Chunk Your Tasks:** I started grouping similar tasks together, like emails and virtual meetings, rather than hopping between them. It‚Äôs like magic‚Äîmy brain‚Äôs way happier, and I get more done! üß†‚ú®
- **Schedule Breaks:** Yes, you read that right. I *schedule my breaks.* It sounds Type-A, but hear me out: when you see that 15-minute break squeezed in, you start looking forward to it. *And* it reminds you that you deserve rest. üôå

### **Pro Tip: Intentional Tech Use**

- **App Detox:** I did a ruthless app clean-up on my phone. *Did I really need five different news apps and notifications from all of them?* Nope! Now I check the news at specific times‚Äîon my terms.
- **Digital Boundaries:** I set tech-free times. My rule? No screens an hour before bed. It may sound tough, but the sleep improvements are worth it. Hello, morning energy! üåÖ

And here's the kicker‚Äîby simply using these strategies, I've found an extra 10 hours each week to invest in, well, me. Yoga, Netflix, or reading that book that's been gathering dust on my shelf. All this from just a few shifts in my routine.

**So, there you have it**, my little experiment in navigating the chaos of daily life. It made a world of a difference and honestly, it feels fantastic. Anyone else have a ritual or tip that changed the game for you? Let's chat! üí¨",1,1743540268.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jp6b2v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jp6b2v,"Who are the Froakie, the Greninja and the Golem?","I don‚Äôt believe anything is as it seems in the Pokemon story. That includes the identities of the Froakie, the Greninja and the Golem. 

But who are they?  Here‚Äôs a theory.

On page 218, when the elderly Greninja shows up, he writes ‚ÄúJust then, I heard a stick snap‚Äù.  I searched on the internet for ‚Äúelderly ninja in pop culture‚Äù and found Splinter the Rat from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  What I learned is that he was originally intended to be a parody of the character Stick from Daredevil.  I think this also explains why the Pokemon characters illustrated in the book differ from the real Pokemon characters.  They are kind of a hybrid. 

I think in a similar vein, the Froakie may be a version of Bart Simpson. In the book the Froakie says ‚ÄúAnd we won‚Äôt see any Bouffalant either, just so you know‚Äù.  This reminded me somewhat of Bart‚Äôs phrase ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have a cow, man‚Äù since Bouffalant are cow like creatures. 

In an earlier post, I mentioned how I think the arcade-coffee-luggage storing place Nostalgia in New Orleans could be a starting point for the story. That arcade included both a Simpsons and a Ninja Turtles machine. So he could be theming the hunt with these characters. 

On page 219, he writes ‚ÄúThe Greninja also introduced me to a wise Golem who happened to have a great idea where we could hide our treasure.‚Äù  Since Splinter (the Greninja) hangs out with the Ninja Turtles, I think maybe the Golem (who looks turtle like) is one of them. 

Out of the four, only Leonardo and Donatello are considered ‚Äúwise‚Äù. Since Leonardo is the leader, I think it‚Äôs a safe bet it‚Äôs him.

Also, the next line ‚ÄúWe circled back‚Äù could be a clever reference to the shape of a turtle‚Äôs shell instead of a directional clue. 

Also, in an earlier post I covered how the Roosevelt Hotel is probably where the ‚ÄúForest opened up and an eagle greeted us from above‚Äù. Directly across the street from the main entrance of the Roosevelt is a sign on a brick wall advertising ‚Äúthe Half Shell‚Äù. The tagline for the ninja turtles is ‚ÄúHeroes in a half-shell‚Äù. 

So, where would Leonardo hide a treasure in New Orleans?  I searched ‚ÄúLeonardo da Vinci New Orleans‚Äù and found the story of The Lost Leonardo.  In 2005, a painting sold at auction in New Orleans for $1500 that turned out to be an original Leonardo da Vinci that later auctioned for $450M.  It‚Äôs a crazy story but it would be a fitting end to this Pokemon hunt to hide the box near where the original da Vinci was uncovered. 

I visited the auction house on St Charles Avenue and talked to the current owners. I left thinking that the treasure (if it‚Äôs in New Orleans) is probably hidden closer to the Roosevelt hotel instead. 

Anyway, hope this info helps your hunt!  I‚Äôve learned that New Orleans is a fascinating place üòÇ

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",1,1743540162.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1jp6aiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1jp6aiq/need_a_quick_vibe_check_am_i_being_the/,Need a quick vibe check -- am I being the unreasonable one?,"BF and I are in our late twenties, and have been together for several years, the last few of which we have lived together. I'm a little more laid-back, and try to choose my battles when confronted with obstacles or inconveniences in life, big or small. BF is a very pragmatic person, highly successful, and perpetually stressed. Extremely thoughtful and intelligent and kind, but low stress-tolerance. 

Today, I loaded the dishwasher, and realized that the garbage disposal was not turning on. I fished around, couldn't find anything, and cleaned what I could manually. Still wouldn't turn on. Texted BF the issue (I was leaving at the time) so that he'd be aware before he came home and inadvertently made it worse. I had recently cleaned my coffee machine, so I apologized in advance in the event some coffee grounds had made their way into the sink and were the issue. This has happened once before (except I'd emptied a more significant amount of coffee grounds into the sink and he was understandably irritated by that, so I've been cautious about that ever since), so I just wanted to get ahead of the problem and make sure he knew I wasn't being careless. 

He gets home, and fishes out a small cylindrical cap to something. I must've knocked it off the counter and into the sink whilst doing the dishes/loading the dishwasher. It must've been placed in the garbage disposal such that when I was fishing around, it felt like the garbage disposal itself and I didn't realize it was a separate piece. 

He sends me a picture of the cap, and about 4-5 long texts about how we need to be more careful in checking, and that I could've broken the garbage disposal. I feel a little taken aback and defensive by the length and vigor of his response, but have not yet substantively responded. I'm thinking to myself -- man, I identified a problem, made an earnest effort to fix the problem, alerted you to the problem so that it didn't catch you unawares, but still find myself getting chastised. If the roles had been reversed, I probably would've sent him a pic of it, and said -- Nice! Figured it out! And would've spend exactly .3 more seconds worth of energy on it before moving on. To be clear, this is not a situation where I have repeatedly made this error and that's why he is so frustrated. This is probably the third or fourth time in 3 years our garbage disposal has gotten stuck/not turned on for some reason or another. 

Would love another opinion. Am I just being overly sensitive? Is the way I'm feeling unreasonably defensive? Is this a normal exchange? Was his reaction proportional to the issue identified? I feel a little crazy.  ",1,1743540140.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had a rough 3rd week when went to increase dose. I just got off phone with doctor and they weren‚Äôt super helpful or understanding. 

The first two weeks I took naltrexone 12.5mg and 1 bupropion around 3pm each day. Had some tough nausea but it eventually was fine.

When I went to increase dose to twice a day I started at 10am. It took about 3-4 awful days (mental and physical side effects) to trial and error issues but I believe it was being so close to my morning (7-8am) Vyvanse medication and coffee. 

So, I decided to switch back to first 3pm dosing until I could discuss with doctor. She said to take it slow and I‚Äôm glad, but I notice that the medicine isn‚Äôt very effective at that low dose anymore. So I asked how can I increase and she really just said start with 10am dose again. 

I asked if I could slowly increase afternoon dose like double dose at 3pm. Maybe start with increasing naltrexone first and then bupropion. She shared that best studied results were done with 2 separate doses. 

I‚Äôm left feeling kinda stuck. I have this weird anxiety towards taking the medicine in morning now. It really mentally messed me up. I was anxious, depressed, crying and felt dissociated with myself. I know new anti depressants have these side effects and will pass. It feels like a hump I have to get over but it was scary and very unnormal behaviour/ thoughts for me.


If anyone has navigated this please share. I cut out coffee and I‚Äôll continue with lowest dose for a few more days then try increasing to 25mg naltrexone for 3pm dose and then hopefully the bupropion. 

Maybe once I feel okay on that I could split the dosing up by a few hours.

We were each other‚Äôs first kiss, but despite the relationship being a first for us both, we had a beautiful, healthy relationship. I can count on one hand the number of days we spent apart in that time. We lived together for over 4 years. We had two dogs. We rarely fought. We worked together all those years too, in regular jobs, in directing dozens of theatre productions, and we even wrote two musicals of our own. We truly brought the best out of each other and worked together magically - our strengths and weaknesses just balanced each other. Other people in our lives always said they had never seen a love life ours, and they still do. He was the most perfect partner, the most supportive, loving, compassionate person, such a gentleman. We waited 8.5 years to have sex - we planned to wait until we were married (greatly at HIS insistence) but eventually went all the way because we were waiting for some financial security and the ability to buy a house to get married. Yes, we grew up together but we also grew together too, perhaps not perfectly, but we navigated so many hard things together, personally, professionally. He had multiple deaths in his family, I was diagnosed with autism, went through a pretty major surgery, we lost some of our closest friends‚Ä¶so many things. But through it all, we were close, connected, happy.

About a year ago, things changed when we befriended a coworker. We both got close with her very quickly and she confided major traumas in us - we immediately became her support system. At first, I tried to be considerate of some alarming behaviors, but after a while, it became clear that she was more interested in my partner than she was in me. My partner, for the first time EVER, would gaslight me and defend her instead. There were multiple incidents where she went way too far - one was a night that she ‚Äúfell‚Äù on his lap TWICE while they were ‚Äúplay fighting‚Äù. I spoke to both of them multiple times about how uncomfortable I was and was met with apologies‚Ä¶yet, it didn‚Äôt stop. She left her long term partner and we let her sleep on our couch. We were so good to her, even when she was making my life hell. Eventually, I had to cut her off after she crossed a major boundary. But he wouldn‚Äôt. That was his friend who understood him better than anyone else and he felt like he‚Äôs known his whole life. She was manipulating him (there‚Äôs a lot of things that support this) and he didn‚Äôt want to hear it.

My anxiety was so bad I would vomit daily before work for months because I had to see her. She started to treat me like I was invisible and follow my partner around the workplace. Yet, aside from our issues with her, aside from other general life stressors, we were more or less okay. But naturally we were fighting and there was no way to reason with him. Still, we talked about the future and planned the holidays and he even consigned on my new car, looked my father in the eyes and said we‚Äôd be married soon‚Ä¶

A few weeks later, a few days before Christmas and the night after I went to the ER with a panic attack, he left me. Everything he said was that of someone rewriting history. He had never addressed any issues or doubts with our relationship, yet I was given no chance to fix them. They didn‚Äôt even feel like his words. In an instant, I lost my love, my home, I had to quit my job, and abandon a future I had such certainty in.

We didn‚Äôt talk for 3.5 weeks before I reached out. And we were then in contact regularly. I‚Äôve been part of the Science of Connection program online and I was following their advice to rekindle our connection. I thought things were going slow but well enough. He hasn‚Äôt asked to see the dogs but I‚Äôve assumed my family‚Äôs reaction has made it trickier. He dropped off the rest of my things a couple of weeks ago and he obviously didn‚Äôt want to see me. We watched him on the camera RUNNING to unpack his car. But I had left him a sentimental gift he was still very appreciative of. That‚Äôs the last time we‚Äôve spoken. I found out last week that he MOVED IN WITH THE OTHER GIRL. And I didn‚Äôt even hear it from him. She posted a photo online of their new living room. I could see his pictures on the wall, OUR coffee table, and his banjo that I painted for him just a year ago sitting in the corner‚Ä¶

This has made the pain so much worse. He is not making rational decisions. Everything from the breakup to now has just been impulsiveness and running away. Even my therapist agrees with that. He‚Äôs even cut off some of our closest friends, which why would he do if he was so confident in his decision - one of these friends had asked him to be his BEST MAN. I should despise him but I know he‚Äôs been manipulated by this girl who‚Äôs been playing a helpless victim when she knows he can‚Äôt set boundaries and has a savior complex. It‚Äôs just insane to see a man who has always been so upstanding, with such good morals and values, act like a true piece of shit. 

And I‚Äôm expected by everybody to figure out a career and move on when I‚Äôm fucking breaking everyday. Everything in my heart feels that this is my soulmate. He was everything I ever wanted and more. He understood and accepted and supported and loved me in ways no one else in my life ever has. I love him more than I‚Äôve ever loved my family. 

I drafted a letter apologizing for all the things I did (I‚Äôve already apologized for some but this is everything) but also calling him out on all of the ways this has hurt me, the depth of the betrayal, all the things that don‚Äôt make sense, all the broken promises. My therapist told me not to send it if I want any chance of reconciliation. 

Half the people in my life are telling me I‚Äôm an idiot for wanting him back. The other half understand either way. I‚Äôm just lost and I miss him. I‚Äôm missing half of my soul and I feel it every second of the day. He was always I want the future we had planned. I wish I could just hate him but my heart loves him deeply and wants him to realize this huge mistake. I just feel like a fool. ",1,1743539540.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Where to go from here?,"I had a recent fallout with a close friend, and I‚Äôm seeking some unbiased advice to ensure I‚Äôm handling the situation in the most productive way. Hoping that someone can resonate.

To give some background, my friend and I were close for almost a decade. We met in our twenties and over the years, even as our friend group slowly moved away and had kids, we stayed tight. That changed last year.

The red flag came when she invited me for coffee one afternoon and presented me with the ol‚Äô, ""We need to talk."" She told me that she‚Äôd been harboring resentment towards me because she felt I had been copying her throughout our friendship. I was completely blindsided; we‚Äôd never even had a fight!!

She proceeded to list off items that she said were ‚Äúher thing‚Äù that I had also started using or purchased (e.g. a specific nail polish color and a piece of jewelry from a brand she loves). I didn‚Äôt want to immediately get defensive, so I just listened. It was clear she believed her identity was tied to these tangible items and being the most *unique* version of herself meant a great deal. It made me sad hearing her explain how much stock she had put into being different and how her perception of herself seemed to be grounded in how others viewed her.

I explained that I might have been inspired by her but never intended to copy. Ffs, I have sisters and other female friends and always thought it was normal to occasionally be influenced by those around you. She didn‚Äôt accept this and said if I ever showed up wearing the same thing, she‚Äôd have to leave. 

In the moment, I just wanted to quickly smooth things over/ deescalate because I was so uncomfortable, so I told her I was sorry. In hindsight, I wish I had said more, but I was caught off guard and my fight-or-flight was telling me to placate her so I could get out of there ASAP to go home and process. 

She admitted that this situation had upset her so much that she considered cutting me off entirely but her husband had convinced her to confront me instead, given our close friendship. She also framed the issue as being particularly hard for HER, having never been put in this position by a close friend since she‚Äôd always been extra mindful in surrounding herself with other unique individuals (ouch!). The conversation ended with her essentially giving me an ultimatum‚Äîand me agreeing to be more cognizant of what I wore around her.

Things seemed to go back to normal(ish) for the next few months; We‚Äôd still hang out occasionally and everything seemed fine (no notable drama). I never brought the conversation up again because it never felt like the right moment to revisit the uncomfortable topic‚Äîand then, before I knew it, it felt like too much time had passed to revisit.

Then, one day, I noticed my texts were going unanswered, and I wasn‚Äôt being invited to events. The timing of this change in communication seemed to coincide with a shopping trip we had taken a couple of weeks prior. While we were hanging out/shopping, I bought a piece of clothing that she also had but in an different color. I even asked her if she was cool with me purchasing it beforehand and she said it was fine [i know, WILD- but if it wasn‚Äôt obvious before‚Äîpeople pleasing is engrained in my DNA and something I‚Äôm working on navigating].

At this point, we haven‚Äôt spoken in ~6 months except for brief, surface-level exchanges (like, happy holidays) but it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs phased me out of her life, and I haven‚Äôt tried to stop it. I‚Äôve considered whether I should reach out to clear the air, but I feel emotionally drained after having walked on eggshells with her. Plus, she doesnt seem willing to do any true self-introspective work, at least not from where I stand.

For now, I‚Äôm giving her the same distance she‚Äôs giving me. I‚Äôll admit, it feels evident that there are deeper issues at play, and I feel more concerned for her than angry or hurt. I‚Äôm just unsure if I should leave things as they are or make one last attempt to reconcile, as I truly valued our friendship before all of this went down.

 Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.
Sorry for the long post too but I think I have to explain the context.

I started dating a man (who was 28) when I was 20, and thinking I was straight. We moved in an appartment when I was 21. After years of living together, I ended this relationship for many reasons :
- he was a momma's boy. His family was kind but put a lot of pressure on me. He did not do his share of the chores, I had all the mental load
- it was toxic. he could be an adorable, affectionate partner but he sometimes gave me silent treatment for hours or even days for details. I felt neglected in many ways too
- he has psychological issues (ADHD and depression). He was never violent but I was his therapist and it is exhausting.
- I found out I am bi and autistic. It means that I know myself now much better than when I was 20 and I felt kind of caught in a choice that I made when I was immature and just wanted all the lovely affection he has to give, without understanding the implications of moving in with an older man who wants kids and all.

Having to deal with all these issues in our relationship/his life while I was at stake with my autism, my toxic parents and my slow realisation that I like women was a lot. In the last few months, it became unbearable. We broke up and went back together within 24hrs (I went back because I still feel a lot of love for him) a few months ago, after a woman asked me out (she was a lesbian, I said no because I am loyal but for the first time I was pissed to say no to a date with someone else).

My will to leave him came back after a few weeks. I was looking for available appartments in my town, I could not stop thinking about all the times he hurt me. I think I needed time to mentally prepare myself.
And then, two weeks ago, I went to a 5-day training session for my job. It was in a nice place, with a nice teacher, and... Of course there was a nice, handsome, adorable and interesting lesbian woman. We had to work together on a fictional project : we had to pretend we were creating an event that revolves around the LGBTQ community/culture. I think I have a lot of knowledge about LGBTQ stuff lol, and so did she of course. She confirmed being a lesbian during a conversation. I was still with this man at this time and only mentionned him once (which did not feel like me, I usually talked about him a lot. I wanted to hide her that i had a man, and to me it means I had already crossed a line). 
We got along pretty well, I wanted to dress well every morning for her. I could barely eat during these day because of the dilemna : I had a big crush on this woman and felt sooo bad in my relationship, but wanted to be loyal to my bf.

After the 5 days of training session and ambiguity between us, we said good bye (we don't work in the same place at all). I did not intend to see her again because all of this was sooo complicated.
 
But the evening after the last day of training session, I went out with other coworkers and talked about my relationship while drunk. I mentioned that I had met a woman, but I mostly spoke about how toxic my relationship was. So I decided to leave for real, and started looking for an appartment so I could move to a new place after telling this man the relationship was over. I was feeling so guilty because I knew he would suffer a lot, and I knew I was going to miss him a lot even though it was the right decision.
But then... A few days after my decision was made, when I had already texted a few appartment-owners, this woman contacted me on my professionnal e-mail adress. It was a very respectful, non-flirty message but she gave me her phone number and told me she enjoyed the few days we worked together. I felt heat in my chest, wanted to tap my feet and giggle. Almost fell off my chair. 

I answered that my life was going to be a little chaotic during a few weeks because I was about to move to a new place, but that I wanted to come to her library to see her. She asked where I was moving ; in my language, there are two ""you"" : singular and plural. So she asked ""where are you moving"" using both plural and single ""you/you"" (vous and tu for the frenchies here), which was a subtle way to ask if i was moving with a partner. I answered I'm moving alone and staying in town, and that after that I planned to come and see her at her workplace. She said she would be pleased if i did so.



So.... What do i do lol ?
I only broke up a few days ago after 8 years. I feel both sad and relieved, excited to move to a knew place and extremely anxious because changing my habits as an autistic person is a lot. I will move next week, I will be living in my new place by the end of april. I know I will still think about my ex a lot, because I worry about him, feel guilty that I left him, and of course i cry because of how much I miss his arms, affection, our huge complicity and all the fun we had together. But it will pass. 

I have never dated a woman. I don't know how to ask her out, how to act, and let's not even talk about having sex because I would have no idea what to do. Sex has been just a task on my to-do lists for so many years in my straight relationship, so doing it with an experienced woman is a lot of pressure. 
This woman gave me her phone number, not knowing I was at the end of a long straight relationship. Maybe my knowledge of LGBTQ community lead her to think I already had a wlw relationship. I really want to spend time with her, I like her, i'd like to flirt with her and get to know her better. But I don't want to disrespect her. What if i start a flirt and then she is surprised/mad that I did not tell her that I've never been with a woman ? What if i don't know how to act ? When should I tell her a little more about my situation ? I want to be honest with her, but I don't want to immediately talk about such serious stuff and be a creep lol, like the kind of people who want to clarify the relationship status after just a coffee date.
I think she needs to know what she's getting into but maybe we should first enjoy a few first dates.
Also it would give me the time to deal with my breakup because I don't want to go back to dating too fast.

So... Here I am. In two weeks, i will be in my appartment with a roommate who seems cool. I will just sit there as a single woman, attracted to women, and who has the phone number of a very cool lesbian. What do i do ? I thought I could first go to her workplace and just say hello. It's a library and I want to borrow books from there anyways so it would be quiet natural and nice.

Advice welcome,"My mum is constantly texting me and ringing me and I find it so hard in the day when I‚Äôm working and if I say that she‚Äôll just get all annoyed and say I never have time for her and she can‚Äôt believe there are conditions on being able to talk to her daughter. She always guilts me with the situation she‚Äôs in with my dad and the fact she‚Äôs living there bored and miserable with him and has no friends or family (they need to divorce but money and her health are constant excuses and it‚Äôs f*c*ing exhausting to hear about every single day).

The hardest thing is if I reduce contact she is on her own. Alone. And I‚Äôm scared of what will happen to her. Shouldn‚Äôt I as her daughter and only family care and isn‚Äôt that the right thing to do? She often guilts me that she has cancer and I‚Äôll regret not seeing her, and she used to see her mum (my gran) all the time and go out for coffee with her during the week, and she wanted a close family like that. She often says ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve never got married and had children. I thought it would stop me being lonely but it‚Äôs just made it worse.‚Äù She‚Äôs always jealous of how much time I spend with my boyfriend when I LIVE with him. I don‚Äôt know what she bloody expected when I became an adult. I remember her sobbing when I left for uni. She caused me to go insane when we recently moved rentals and said I was causing her to be ‚Äúon the verge of a nervous breakdown with worry‚Äù because I was moving somewhere she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know‚Äù and was worried about my safety - despite the area being rated one of the best places to live in London, and me proving to her it has a reputation of being a lovely and safe family area. My therapist helped me realise this was her lashing out because she thought I would eventually move home closer to her after I graduated from university and I haven‚Äôt. 

Just wondered if anyone else is on the other side of this guilt? Every time I go down to see her, I try and make her happy and it‚Äôs arguments and misery and her constantly complaining at me. I have been grey rocking instinctively to protect myself for years before I even discovered what that term was last week. She gets triggered when I don‚Äôt fully engage with her and comfort her all the time and starts shouting at me when I‚Äôm grey rocking and I find it so hard to not react without getting wound up myself at how she‚Äôs treating me. She says things like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt talk to me like you‚Äôre my daughter you talk like I‚Äôm a work colleague‚Äù ‚Äústop it with all this therapist talk why can‚Äôt you just speak to me normally.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you ever say mum I miss you I want to come down and see you why is it always me wanting to see you.‚Äù WHY DO YOU THINK. I‚Äôm so f***ing exhausted with all of it. Any other only children I would appreciate your perspective too, as I‚Äôve always craved a sibling who could understand and help me with her.

He was a coworker at the time we were married and they had business trips together. I want to know did they have an affair. None of my business though.

 He is 56 and she's 40 with 2 young kids - he has to relocate from the coast to the middle of the country. Why bro? Why not meet someone your age nearby. He's ex military and reasonable successful and would do well in the regular dating pool. Why her? 

I think I know the kinds of topics and questions to ask like 
1. His experience being a parent 
2. Laying out the groundwork concerning my ex and I co-parenting goals and requesting he supports them
3. Logistics like respecting our custody agreement flexibility

Someone I can massage and cook meals for and make happy so she tells me how good I am doing.

I am saying this because I think anyone who might be interested in talking to me deserves to know but also because maybe someone can relate to those feelings and would like someone who understands the struggle.

But enough about the sad and sappy stuff, lets talk about my least favorite subject: me.  
I love playing videogames (all sorts) and watching all kinds of movies, anime, manga, I even got into books recently. I also love writing and sometimes drawing, although its hard to motivate myself to it often. I used to really enjoy bike riding until.. it got stolen which makes the process a little difficult lol  
I want to go outside more in the future but I am more of a quiet guy. I am also vegan since five years now and enjoy cooking. \^\^

I have shoulder long blond hair, blue/green eyes, am 186cm tall, weigh about 60kg and people often tell me I look like I haven't slept in two years and saw my cat get blown up by a tank on it's birthday.. oh and I have an Evangelion and Goodnight Punpun tattoo!! :D

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I saw a bunch of reels detailing a specific ratio of ingredients. My issue is that it takes ~15m to get a stable enough foam. There has to be a faster way!

- 3 tbsp heavy cream
- 2 tbsp whole milk
- 1 tbsp flavor syrup

All ingredients are straight from the fridge so they are cold when I combine them

This is the foamer I have

1jp5mcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jp5mcc/do_you_agree_with_trial_shifts/,do you agree with trial shifts?,"just want to preface by saying i have 2 years of experience in coffee, i am trying to get a job to just support myself financially and due to my experience my only option at the moment is barista jobs tbh. every job i apply to ask for trial shifts, and while i understand it's to see my skills in action, i just feel like its so unnecessary, especially for someone with experience. 

i would imagine the hiring process can go like this:

step 1: interview based on the application, looking at character and personality, discussions about previous roles etc

step 2: maybe a small trial of making a few drinks, going over standards and expectations. especially during a quieter time so there are rooms for questions etc

  
i feel like having a 2 hour unpaid trial is so unproductive, especially as the trials i've done in the past didn't have the interviewer or manager present, and i was mostly stuck on tills during their busiest hours. most of the time they would reject my application, and it just tells me they needed someone to help them out. i feel like it's really not that deep, you'd never see anyone doing trial shifts for retail jobs so why does hospitality almost always require them?

i just don't think someone with hospitality experience needs to go through hours of trials just to get a low paid job. let me know your thoughts ",2,1743538518.0,barista,13,0.67,False

Check out the MSC Yacht Club! It offers the best cruise experience I have ever had‚Äîtruly exclusive and luxurious! This is something everyone should try at least once in their life. Be sure to watch the video to see it for yourself!

The experience includes fine dining, an exclusive sundeck, bars, and a buffet. Each room comes with a personal butler available 24/7, ready to assist with anything you might need. Embarkation and disembarkation are the smoothest I've ever experienced. 

Upon boarding the ship, you'll be greeted with glasses of champagne and mimosas! Plus, there's an all-inclusive drink package that covers most alcoholic beverages on board. Your mini-fridge is stocked daily, and there‚Äôs a convenient Nespresso machine for all your coffee needs.

Each guest in your stateroom can enjoy complimentary Wi-Fi for two devices each, and the connection actually works well! Your room is cleaned twice a day, including an afternoon turndown service. You'll also have access to an exclusive room service menu, all included in the rate.

One of the highlights is the spacious bathroom. It features extensive storage, a decent shower with a rainfall showerhead, and a wonderful attachment. All of this is included in a standard Yacht Club Deluxe room, making it an incredible value for such luxury and service without breaking the bank!

Don‚Äôt forget to check out the YouTube video for visuals of everything I‚Äôve described! I hope you enjoyed my perspective on the Yacht Club and the video!",1,1743538501.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,0,1.0,False

It's me my wife and our 2 year old. My wife works from home, and I am self employed and need room for my business in the house. Our apartment has gotten too small for us, Somerville has always been too expensive for us, so we're looking to move to a more affordable place.

We are looking for a place that is still walkable, has nice parks, restaurants, and coffee shops that we can walk to. We also want¬†a family friendly place that has a lot of events and stuff for kids to do.

The main place we're thinking of right now is providence. We've been there a few times and it has a similar vibe to Boston and is much cheaper. We don't know much about the family friendliness of providence, so some incite into that would be helpful too.

Are there any other walkable, affordable towns in the area that we should look into?",0,1743538455.0,boston,16,0.38,False
