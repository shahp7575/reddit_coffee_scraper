I created this account to anonymously explore and review local coffee shops around my city. As I mentioned in my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/londonontario/comments/1ftzvxx/london_cafe_review_from_a_very_casual_cyclists/), my idea was to combine a few of my hobbies‚Äîphotography, espresso, and biking. This account has become a creative outlet for me (does this count as journaling?), so I wanted to take a moment to document a deeper dive into my hobbies for anyone curious about what drives my caf√© reviews.

Let‚Äôs start with the simplest: my home espresso setup. I spent a lot of time falling down coffee-related rabbit holes, and it can get *very* overwhelming‚Äîespecially with all the posts on r/espresso asking for ""best beginner machines ($800+),"" which nearly put me off the hobby. But then I found [Tom's Coffee Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au92VvBYLrA) on YouTube. His videos showed me that you can make great espresso on a budget with just a few modifications and technique improvements!

So, here‚Äôs my current setup: I found a De'Longhi ECP 3420 on Marketplace for $50. With a few key upgrades‚Äî[bottomless portafilter](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CBSGQML3?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), [puck screen](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B09XCQ6TXG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), [dosing funnel](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BYPBP2YY?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), [tamper](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CDGHQ2RX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), [electronic scale/timer](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CLG4XQBS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), [WDT](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BXK7Q1XZ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), [350ML Milk Pitcher](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B084YR5FR3?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1), [Steam Nozzle Replacement](https://www.amazon.ca/Machine-Stainless-Replacement-ECP3420-Enhanced/dp/B0CWJ2SPBB/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AG6920YH1KVH&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RlVk_F54_FVCkn2rA33DeOZAoHrAhDB8jTl5GOfmlGUIRG398lHdOi1t3AhfpKjGYeZwEnExKk5ITQYUU344iYUhCYAC0skHBaYz-xbFrvceN53pHMH7cgteWiOyzEFqmrUUiyrwXbTLr3NrXXrhQiKpvS4drmVr2hkT8V2K450XkjKJuTpK5akxnG6zG9NZxiErtPN_gLhjN-X-vfSZoqTIWDVutMgMcoBXuoPK7y8.zLA3MnPlBe23YOG-DMHl87DId08WXjkUxegzNnm83eE&dib_tag=se&keywords=ECP3420+Nozzle+tri&qid=1729536338&sprefix=ecp3420+nozzle+tri%2Caps%2C78&sr=8-1) (I went with the Tri-Tip)‚ÄîI‚Äôm able to make cortados that are better than any caf√© I‚Äôve been to. The star of my setup is definitely my [Timemore C3 ESP Pro Hand Grinder](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CC4ZJGFR?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title), which is worth every penny. They say it‚Äôs better to invest in the grinder than the machine, and I totally agree.

If I could give any advice to beginners: you can probably skip the WDT if you‚Äôre using a puck screen like I do. I also regret buying my cheap scale‚Äîit works, but you can find better options with a bit more research. Oh, and get a dosing funnel that sits on top of the basket, not inside‚Äîit‚Äôs less messy. At the end of the day, though, it‚Äôs really all about your grinder, your beans, and how well you can dial them in. Don‚Äôt get caught up in trying to match all the crazy setups you see online!

Photography is another hobby I picked up last year when I booked a trip to Walt Disney World with my then-girlfriend (now fianc√©e!). I wanted to capture lasting memories because I find iPhone photos lack depth. I started with my mom‚Äôs Sony NEX-5 and soon got into vintage lenses that I could adapt to it. - quickly aquired quite the nice m42 mount lense collection. These lenses then inspired me to ventured into film photography with an Asahi Pentax Spotmatic I purchased from [London Vintage Camera Show](https://www.instagram.com/londonvintagecamerashow/). After a couple of trips to the [repair shop](https://photographicrepairs.com/), it‚Äôs working like a dream. I also have a Minolta Hi-Matic AF2 (courtesy of my fianc√©e‚Äôs grandpa) and a quirky little Olympus Pen EE-2. Recently, I upgraded to a Lumix G9, which covers all my photography needs, and I‚Äôve even started making recap videos of my spring and summer adventures. I still use the Sony NEX-5 as a point-and-shoot with a 16mm pancake lens‚Äîit‚Äôs small and convenient for travel.

Now for my latest obsession: bikes. It started with wanting to maintain my own bike instead of taking it to the shop for every minor fix, but it‚Äôs grown into a full-on passion for restoring my dad‚Äôs old bikes, r/xbiking style. I am keeping the bike's themselves a secret as although they are not worth much (good ol 90's Cro-Mo) they are a fairly rare brand that I havent seen anywhere else and I dont want to be ""exposed"" out in the wild.... although the barista at Dough EV did ask if I was ""the person on reddit"", guess pulling up to a cafe on a bike and ordering just a cortado is enough of a give away... but anyways!

I‚Äôve been upgrading one of them with 90s Shimano STX derailleurs and crank (the chrome looks great on a blue bike). I also added some [Nitto B204AAF](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/126703111031) handlebars to reduce the stretched-out position from the old flat bars. I swapped the grip shifters for friction thumbies (love them!) and plan to add racks for commuting. The final touches will be stainless cable housing, silver flat pedals, and some pavement-friendly tires (probably Panaracers). This will be my slow winter project, but I‚Äôm already enjoying the progress. And the other bike is my more agressive ride position - can take anwhere stealth black bike that I just love to ride. That one has had all its work done at [Spoke and Sproket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qa5dtvJzG41yez6k8), where they tuned it up and changed the grip shift to indexed - and although i like the index i may also turn that to friction down the line simply because it will be easier to maintain.

Oh, and I‚Äôve commissioned some awesome custom hanging bike reflectors from [kinanggg\_\_](https://www.instagram.com/kinanggg__/?hl=en). The shipping was steep, but I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on them!

If you've made it to the bottom of this longgg post - congrats! I would like to hear and questions/comments you may have - especially if you share any of these hobbies with me. Also if you happen to have any 90's bike parts that youd like to part with please let me know :)",1,1729539686.0,u_CortadoCommuter,0,1.0,False

On Saturday I was physically assaulted on the sidewalk, in the middle of the day, residential area with other people in front of me and behind me. It was so strange, the man tried to shove my head into a bike and then ran away when someone yelled at him. 

Then yesterday, I went to a spiritual church service to receive some guidance and left feeling good, but on the walk home I had three different incidents of harassment. One man even pulled over and insisted I give him the flower I was holding from the service so I did. Later, a teen/20something tried to run me over with an electric scooter. He turned around like 4 times and would aim right at me, I had to run in a coffee shop to get away.

I am wondering if anyone has any insight on why these things might be happening. Is my fear the cause, am I manifesting fearful situations? All incidents were in daylight with a lot of people around who helped me and told me how bizarre it was, I‚Äôm not in a violent area. I know the astrology is very volatile this month as well, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm being targeted for some reason or am being warned that something worse is going to happen if I leave the house alone. 

I‚Äôm having trouble connecting with my guidance and meditating, so I deeply appreciate any advice. üôèüèº

What does that mean?,"So bare with me I never been in reddit before but my friend if I want good answers to go here. So ya I been dreaming nothing but spider.

A little bit the contacts, i'm a wicked Mostly by choice, after I figure out that I can see shit in my dreams. What I mean by ""see shit"" is that I see pieces of time in the future ether my own or someone else.

They always in great detail they always in full color but they never last long than a minute or two. You can say that it can be dejaravu or dreams are just weird like that but when I saw my ant die before she overdose in my sleep I choose to believe the other option.

Anyway I was hiding this dreams in my house I had a small mug of coffee when I know it was my mug when it was white with pictures of platypus on it. I was sitting in the dining room with that old yellow light chandelier we have above are wood table and when I look over at are windows I saw the were covered in plastic and light was shining in to the room so I knew it had to be fall or winter knowing we only covered those windows when it get cold cause they are beautiful old windows that are one of a kind and me and my mother love to show them off to guests.

I wasn't alone my mother was across from me she was looking at her phone hear music from some 2 minutes video. I was about to take a drink of coffee when I saw this big white and black spider in my mug of coffee.

It look like a wolf spider but bigger than a normal spider and when I saw it more started coming from the coffee but they wasn't like the white one. Normal black and brown normal wolf spider come from the mug and crawl up my hands.

Of course I painc I try to get the spider off but I just can't get my eyes off this one white and black spider still in my cup my mother came over with her cup and try to drown the spiders and that when I always wake up.

This dream keep showing up and it odd caues it stop other dreams I be exploring just out of no where it starts with me holding that mug then it repeated.

Caues I'm a wicked I thought it have to be a sign something wants to reach out, but I work with majority angels not the human types made from newer translation. I mean the biblically accurate original my favorite is Meg. That just what I call them but you all might know them from by Megataon.

I know they are not the ones giving my this dreams caues they loud with their signs always some white and yellow colors with loud music. This dreams seem like it was trying to mimic, what signs are I'm normally get from them that why I'm so suspicious on what this all really means and like some outside opinions.

Caues good at some drawings I'll try to draw that big white spiders while I see have it in my mind. I'll update later with the drawing to see if that help.

(Update for the drawing here caues posted was removed.)

I know how to reduce my weight I know what works and I know I need to eat more protein be in a calorie deficit and workout to achieve my goal.

A normal meal for one time which would fill me and keep me full for a few hours is usually around 700-800 calories. How do I be in a calorie deficit.

Afternoon: 
250 gm chicken breast grilled with minimal oil

Evening: 
1 banana with 1 cup black coffee

Night:
250 gm chicken breast grilled

Afternoon:
500 gm grilled chicken

Evening:
Banana and coffee

Night: 
2-3 boiled egg or omelette

I need some advice on whether I'm overreacting or if my frustration is justified. Lately over the last few weeks someone at work has been taking my snacks from the office fridge without asking. I even hid them, but it didn‚Äôt help.

*edit: my colleagues and I often get some Cookies or other Snacks when i am Out f√∂rmlich and Put them in the kitchen forneceryone, then i wrote a Short notice or Mail that Theres Snacks for everyone in the kitchen

A colleague told me last week that she saw a colleague taking my chocolate from the fridge. When she pointed out that it belonged to someone, the person responded, ""I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôll wait and see if anyone complains.""

This really bothered me because I had labeled the chocolate with a Post-it (with my initials), and I had already shared some with everyone in the office. The last few bars were for myself, but that didn‚Äôt seem to matter.

I addressed this on our office‚Äôs digital bulletin board, explaining that this has happened multiple times and that it‚Äôs frustrating to bring up something like this in a team of 15 people. Since then, the colleague who took the chocolate has been ignoring me. He doesn‚Äôt even say ""good morning"" anymore, which has made things a bit awkward.

To clarify, we do have communal items like tea, coffee, milk, and fruit available for everyone. However, I think personal snacks should be off-limits unless permission is given.

Now I‚Äôm unsure if I should address this directly with the colleague or just let it go. I don‚Äôt want unnecessary tension, but it‚Äôs frustrating to have my things taken without asking, and now I‚Äôm being ignored. Am I overreacting, or should I speak up again?

Had pretty good control (esp. for the lack of tech) during my childhood. During college and my early 20's, I had terrible management. I was rationing insulin (part of the time), and not in a great mental space. My A1C got over to be over 10 and I felt terrible all the time. Never played any sports or anything. 

A series of factors, including a stay in the hospital and earning enough money, led to me getting things under control, and my A1C got down to the 6 range by 2019. I was also working out a lot in 2019 and feeling a lot better. I weighed about 130ish, which felt like a healthy weight for my height- 5'4"". 

Then when the pandemic hit, things got bumpy again. I stopped exercising because I couldn't go to the gym, didn't have a bicycle/weights/etc, and running outside is really hard on my knees. I probably could've found another way to exercise, but I just kept thinking covid would be over soon. I also wasn't very good about what I ate at the time. Large portions, carb-heavy, and probably a bit more beer than I needed to be drinking. 

So, between taking more insulin, not exercising, and eating a highish-carb diet, I gained about 30 pounds during the lockdown era. 

Today, I weigh 155-160 and my A1C has plateaued in the high 6's. I know my A1C is technically fine, but I'd like to bring it down to at least the low 6's. I'd also like to lose about 30 pounds, which doesn't seem like a lot, but feels impossible when taking insulin. I know things could be way, way worse, but I hate how I look and miss how it felt to be relatively trim. 

Here's what I'm doing: I have altered my coffee, lunch, snack, etc habits, so now, 5 out of 7 days (on average), I don't consume a single carb before dinner. I've moderately lowered my dinnertime carbs, too, although I still have a pizza or pasta once a week because I don't want my poor wife to be miserable. I made that change about 6 months ago. About 2 months ago, I returned to the gym 2-3 days a week. 

My new diet has definitely improved my numbers, but it doesn't seem like my A1C has improved much. 6.8 to 6.7 over six months, IIRC. The gym has been frustrating because half the time, my blood sugar goes low during, even though I fully remove my pump for the duration of the workout. 

So I guess I'm just seeking general advice. Am I just being impatient? How to lose a bit of weight as a T1D? Sorry this got a bit ranty, but I really really appreciate anyone who took the time to read. ",2,1729538917.0,diabetes_t1,0,0.75,False

I'd consider myself a very dynamic person. I write a lot, am a pretty good artist, have a pretty demanding job, play guitar, love cinema and music, fence as a sport, staff a leadership/public speaking program, am on a leadership council for a club, am a barista for my school's coffee stand, etc. 

Issue is, I'm super inconsistent. 

The writing, job, and leadership camp are somewhat stable, but the rest of my activities? They're a mess. 

I can draw very realistic portraits, but for actual hours? I don't draw nearly as much as I used to. As of the past 6 months or so, it's probably averaged at less than an hour a week. 

Guitar? Hardly ever practice. Seriously--I took lessons for a bit in sophomore and junior year, but I hardly pick it up nowadays. 

Fencing? I was rigorous with it junior year, but after switching clubs and starting a job, I hardly make it to any practices at all. 

Leadership council? Our club hardly meets at all, much less the leaders of it. 

Barista at the school coffee stand? We're only open on Wednesdays before school, and baristas get rotated around so I work about once a month. For an hour. 

Music and cinema? Who cares that I enjoy *watching* movies or *listening* to music as a hobby, as deep as I get into it? 

What do I do? It's all such a mess. How do I make it look good for schools? I do a lot, but I do it in a very scattered and fluctuating way where I don't know how to communicate my hobbies, interests, and what I'm involved in. ",1,1729538592.0,ApplyingToCollege,0,1.0,False
1g8y9r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GochiUsa/comments/1g8y9r5/rewatching_the_anime_more_or_less_10_years_later/,Rewatching the anime (more or less) 10 years later,"I remember watching Is the Order a Rabbit's first two seasons not long after I moved out of my old house. It was a rather unpleasant time at that old house, and I was still a bit emotionally tender. I was pretty new to anime in general, but GochiUsa was one I looked back on fondly for being comfy and heartfelt. I wanted to watch the first two seasons before watching the third, because I hadn't even realized a third came out. Before I knew it just about 10 years had passed since I first saw them, so recently I sat down and pulled out my recently bought blu rays and watched them again.

I remembered next to nothing about the show, the only things I recalled were Cocoa and Chino's general personalities, my positive feelings toward Chino and a couple of standout jokes. I also remembered the confy and relaxing atmosphere the show exuded overall, at first I was surprised at how little there was in terms of heartfelt moments in the first half of season 1. It starts off much more comedy focused then I figured, however once it established the main cast the heartfelt vibes quickly sunk in. I didn't laugh at most of the jokes, honestly the humor fell surprisingly flat for me. But what made me stick around was the sheer sweetness of the show. Seeing these girls come together and do fun things together, share their feelings to each other and the moments that showcase just how much they love each other. That semi-ordinary and happy life I dreamed of having back then and even now, maybe I'm a unique case having suffered a bit growing up but that peace and happiness is what made it so easy to watch. And I loved the caf√© motif, even if coffee was hardly ever a focus of the show. It helped to build that homey atmosphere I adore.

Overall the cast grew on me on the second go around, I can appreciate Syaro's tenacity as she struggles with things like her fears and lack of cash, Aoyama was a pleasant surprise as someone who wants to be an author and Chiya had a big glow up and may just be my 2nd favorite out of all the girls. She's such a silly goof but also a sweetheart (which I guess applies to everyone tbh) and I appreciate seeing a fellow green eyed brunette, she's very pretty and someone I'd want to hug and cuddle with (which again applies just about everyone)

More than anything I can't help but have bittersweet feelings toward the franchise. It's amazing seeing the community share their merchandise or geek out over their favorite characters, the show is incredibly marketable. It's incredible seeing the impact it has had on many people and the feelings it inspires. But I can't help but grow melancholic at the thought that I'll never create anything on quite the same level. I dream of forming the same passionate fanbases I see all around the world, but I'm afraid I lack the resources and talent to make it a reality. I've started writing a story with GochiUsa as a piece of my inspiration (it features a group of 5 girls, and they actually have nearly identical colors used for each as GochiUsa's main 5). Granted my story tackles a bit more serious subject matter but I'd like to some day somehow make it a real thing for people to enjoy.

Overall I wasn't blown away, but I can't help but love it, albeit in a sort of unorthodox way. It's charming, warm and full of heart",6,1729538567.0,GochiUsa,1,1.0,False

It's strange to think how quickly time passes. It feels like just yesterday I was pouring my heart and soul into the first draft of Demayth, a massive tome filled with rules, lore, and the dream of a unique card-based RPG.  Years of late nights, countless revisions, and a whole lot of coffee fueled that initial creation.  Now, looking back over the past decade, it's incredible to see how far Demayth has come.

Each new keystroke, each carefully crafted card, and every playtest session has been a labor of love. The joy of watching players bring their demigod characters to life, the thrill of witnessing strategic card battles unfold, and the satisfaction of seeing a community form around this shared passion ‚Äì these are the rewards that make every moment worthwhile.

**The Ever-Evolving Battle Master Guide**

Even now, as I delve deeper into the creation of the Battle Master guide, I'm filled with a sense of purpose and excitement.  Three chapters in, and I'm already exploring new depths of the Everland‚Äôs, uncovering hidden lore, and crafting tools to empower future storytellers.  It's a challenging process, but one that I embrace with open arms.

**The Bitter sweetness of Community**

The journey of Demayth wouldn't be complete without acknowledging the community that has sprung up around it.  I've made incredible friends through this game, people who shared my passion for adventure, strategy, and collaborative storytelling.  Sadly, as with all things in life, people change and move on.  Some of those early friends have drifted away from Demayth, pursuing new paths and passions.

But amidst the bitter sweetness of change, there's also a profound sense of gratitude.  The friends who remain, the new faces who join the community, and the unwavering support of those who continue to champion Demayth ‚Äì you are the driving force behind this incredible journey.  You are the ones who make this game truly special.

**Looking Ahead**

As I continue to write, to create, and to nurture the Demayth community, I'm filled with a sense of optimism and anticipation.  The future holds countless possibilities, new stories to tell, and exciting adventures to embark on.

Thank you for being a part of this journey.  Here's to the next chapter, the next decade, and the continued growth of the Demayth community!

There was a sticky note left on the tupperware that said ‚Äú For Mom‚Äù but my name is not Mom so I was a bit confused. I guess my they forgot my name is Martin not Mom?

 Anyways, I recently had an interaction at a coffee shop while I was talking to a fellow landchad friend. We were talking about this weeks rent increases and taking notes from each other so that we don't get ripped off by our greedy tenants. At one points in the conversation, we moved to our emotional baggage that came with inheriting land from our parents and the strain it has had on our mental health. I made sure that I was speaking loud enough that the entire coffee shop could hear since our struggles are often minimized by society. As I was speaking, a stranger sitting next to us rudely interrupted and said, ‚Äú wow you are lucky you got land from your parents.‚Äù Did she say LUCKY!? My breath catched and after a moment of processing what she had said, I broke down into tears because of the hate speech and felt so misunderstood. That lady has NO IDEA the amount of stress I have had over deciding when to increase rent, evict greedy tenants, and fix plumbing or other so called ‚Äúimportant‚Äù issues. I left in haste making sure not to tip the greedy coffee shop baristas and went home.

I tried everything and no doctors knew what was wrong.. they wanted to put me on a colostomy bag.. this whole time I was very suicidal for the first time in my life and to escape I took up valorant.. it was a dark place for me then. Like another layer of the hell I was in. But I had no energy and it was very stimulating and kept me awake. Well eventually I found the cure and it was yoga. I was now 28 and 6 years prior I pulled a muscle in my back and it caused gait issues and slowly my pelvic floor seized up without me realizing having a bad leg was such a fatal condition. 

So continue on for 2 years of me doing the yoga, having chronic pain and fatigue, but praise god my ass was dry, and I go home after de-stressing my body and play some high intensity valorant, and I keep wondering why my leg can‚Äôt fucking heal, i wake up and it‚Äôs right back in its old twisted state.. turns out after taking up meditation, just staring at a little circle I have drawn on My wall for 20 min till I get proper bored, and calm‚Ä¶ this video game causes massive nervous system hangovers for like 2 days to the point I can‚Äôt access my parasympathetic nervous system at all without pain, fatigue. 

Well this past month I have been doing much better and the leg is staying straight, and so much more amazing great things have happened, such as my third eye chakra finally opening, and with it such great focus and motivation and intent. And I attribute much of the progress towards my wall staring practice, and avoiding games(also coffee, and porn, and nicotine, and weed) I must admit I am still addicted, to all of these things, and if I do one I will do one or another with it‚Ä¶ and then it takes like 2 days for my chakras to come back online and my nervous system to be in a balanced state‚Ä¶. But i am miserable those 2 days‚Ä¶ so I think its finally time I am deleting my valorant account, and selling my graphics card. I am doing this from a good place, and I have meditation and other hobbies now to fill the gap enough.

I empathize with everyone and everything you go through and the struggle we face every day is something most people can never fathom.

Compared to most here I feel my N2 symptoms manifest in a much different way. I was diagnosed a little over a decade ago for what I mistakenly thought at the time was severe insomnia.  In short I basically can't stay asleep for very long unlike some here that can stay asleep for 14-16+ hours.  I normally fall asleep right away but can't sustain it for more than a few minutes to an hour or two at most and even then end up waking multiple times during these periods.  My sleep study tech mentioned that I had woken up close to 200 times during the overnight portion of my sleep study which he had never seen before.  I myself remember waking up just 3 or 4 times which shows how badly I have it.  The best way I describe it to people is when somebody slams the door shut each time I almost walk through and I keep trying time after time with no success until I finally give up.  I basically micro sleep and never truly sleep in any sense of the word.  My better half always mentions I nod my head up and down the entire time as if I'm having a conversation with someone in my sleep (she likes to joke by asking if I'm cheating on her with someone in my N2 sleep state as I never agree with anyone let alone her that vigorously with in real life:)

Even with all this I somehow function during the day without taking any meds that can keep me awake and by fighting off my sleep attacks doing pushups, applying cold packs to the back of my neck and sheer willpower.  I do this because I'm so paranoid that even touching caffeine let alone meds might affect my night time sleep that I haven't had coffee in almost a decade.  If everything fails and I end up taking a daytime nap, unlike most, I inevitably end up paying for it at night with even worse sleep if that's even possible.  On the plus side I don't have to deal with sleep inertia or sleep paralysis and don't encounter nightmares or hallucinations.

Thanks to this sub, I now know about sodium oxybates and am currently on Xywav as of almost 2 months ago.  It's helped quite a bit although my body is now getting used to it to the point that it's only working for the first 3-4 hours and not the 5-6 hours I was getting initially.  Even then unlike most people I never slept the full 4 hours on the 2nd dose more like the first hour or two and at this point I have more nights that I don't sleep at all after taking the 2nd dose.  I'm at 4g twice a night so I haven't given up hope completely since I have yet to reach the max 4.5 dose twice a night but I'm a bit afraid that it won't be the miracle I hoped it'd be.  Its like my body is allergic to sleep let alone restorative sleep and any means necessary to achieve it.

I am trying to piece together a Solar set up for a tiny home.  I am just trying to have enough electrical power for a couple lights, charge my phone and laptop and a maybe a small coffee grinder.

I have found a 405W panel by JA Solar for a decent deal locally.  

Max Rated Power - 405W
Voc - 37.23V
Isc - 13.87A
 
Currently I have my eye on the following equipment:

Victron 100/30 MPPT,
LiTime 12V 100Ah LiFePO4 Battery w/ BMS,
Renogy 700W 12v PSW inverter,
25ft 10awg between panel and controller

Just curious if there are any red flags in this set up as this will be my first experience working with solar.  I chose a larger panel since I am in the PNW (Vancouver) and we can have numerous days in a row with less than 1 solar hour per day.  

If I were to want to add another of the same panel one day would this be possible with wiring them in series or would I need a larger MPPT?  At which points would I want protection in this set up besides the internal protection from the inverter?

Any information would be much appreciated.

I also have been receiving medication since I was diagnosed + all the supportive factors which come with early intervention. 

However, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to anticipate or manage when my brain decides to stop working- despite taking my medication. 

For example, I am a medical student and I take a very very important exam next week. I have been chugging along, taking down lots of information, and perfectly able to process what im learning...until today. 

Today my brain will not work. It feels like a very heavy, expansive gas in my head pushing outwards preventing me from learning anything. I am familiar with caffeine + stimulant naps (a blessing and a curse, love a good coffee nap) and I basically feel non the verge of one but need to continue studying. 

Does anyone experience this and have figured out a cause? Maybe even a solution? 

Up until this point in my life the ebb and flow of brain power didn't jeopardize much. Was it inconvenient and annoying? Totally, but harmless.  But right now, especially this last week I have to study are pivotal and I have no idea what I can do when my brain decides to stop working or when my stimulate makes me tired...

I‚Äôve been speaking with a few ex-Amazon and ex-Microsoft consultants who are already selling a variation of this service with great success. For example, I know a marketing agency that added 500 clients in the e-commerce space using this approach.

1g8xx3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1g8xx3r/over_a_year_after_a_poly_breakup_and_im_still/,Over a year after a poly breakup and I'm still struggling. This isn't normal. What can I do?,"I'll try to keep this as simple as possible and not go into details.

About 2 years ago my long term partner and I wanted to try polyamory. We decided to seek out a partner to be in a throuple. Important note: I now understand why this was a bad idea and why that practice is frowned upon in most poly communities. I was ignorant before but I truly and deeply regret this approach.

We met someone and at first it felt so easy, so natural. Life felt beautiful and magical, love was everywhere and I felt it. For a very brief period of time I was happy. But unsurprisingly it was too good to be true. Our partner grew more cold and distant, got involved with a ""friend"" that he wasn't very forthcoming about, and by the time he broke it off I knew it was coming. I was hurt and confused, but I'm not going to fight for someone who doesn't want me, so I accepted it.

I found out my partner was texting my ex for about a week after the breakup without me knowing (partner mentioned he wanted to keep in contact, but forgot to tell me when they started talking again, he has ADHD so it was a sincere mistake). They swore there was nothing sexual going on, I believe them. I wasn't thrilled, but I didn't want to be controlling so I didn't object. When they agreed to meet in public and hang out as friends I felt sick. I didn't want to be there, I was still grieving and didn't feel ready. So again, I didn't say anything.

Then one time after they got coffee my partner said that our ex still has feelings for him. I asked my partner if he felt the same way, and he said yes.
It feels like that was when my whole world really shattered. Is it possible to split on the entire world? That's what it felt like.

Shortly after, our ex ghosted and moved out of state. But for months afterward the future of our relationship felt uncertain. My partner didn't know whether or not he wanted to continue being poly. This experience turned me away from it completely, so eventually I had to accept that if he wanted to continue pursuing polyamory, he'd have to do it single. He has since assured me that he wants to be with me, our relationship is more important to him. But now I feel like we opened a door that will never fully close. It's been well over a year since this all happened but I get so paranoid that he'll change his mind or realize he'd be happier with multiple partners. We've worked so hard to repair our relationship but it doesn't feel the same and it never will. I have no feelings for our ex, I don't want him back in my life at all, but I still think about him. I think about him with my partner and all the times it was so painfully obvious that our ex liked my partner more than me.

I still get so angry about it and I trust people even less than I did before. I don't know what to do, I want to move on but this keeps haunting me. I don't have anyone I feel comfortable talking about this to so i've had to deal with it completely alone. I know I should let it go by now but I still feel so disgusting and unwanted and unlovable. This is one of my deepest, most shameful regrets and I just want to forget and move on with my life.",1,1729537713.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Robotics company- you guessed it.
Richtech creates AI integrated, humanoid robots for a variety of industries such as food & beverage, med & pharmaceutical, automotive and home improvement.
They can be found in hospitals, restaurants, coffee shops, as well as manufacturing facilities, both big and small. 

They‚Äôve become more publicly known since making their major league debut at the 2024 MLB All-Star game, mixing drinks behind bar for 40k fans. 
Most recently, they‚Äôve become a franchisee of Ghost Kitchens America. This deal expands restaurant operations across Arizona, Colorado and Texas giving them exclusive rights of operation to an additional 20 restaurants. Already having locations in Illinois and Georgia, this deal is multiplying their current portfolio 10X, with each location expected to generate revenue of 700k-

With a marketcap of less than 160 million, I feel confident investing aggressively into this company. Even better.. their market cap is currently only 68 million. So I‚Äôve personally allocated 93% of my portfolio to Richtech where I will be holding for years to come.

In all my past playthroughs, I just used the Arctic as an annoying region where I had to send lots of ships filled with resources and get gas in return. So in my latest game, I tried to do something different and properly develop it so it can produce all what it needs locally, without any import from the other regions (once fully built).

[All used islands \(main island, one small and one larger + all the gas plateaus\)](https://preview.redd.it/egoyxocv65wd1.png?width=224&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff212642fff0d0f2a1b9aa1dd48cd666662dd39)

In case some people are interested, these were my set of constraints/objectives :

* provide all unlocked basic needs and luxury/heat needs (except coffee), no ""ignoring schnaps and canned food"" allowed
* no import from other regions allowed (once fully built)
* extract gas from all available nodes (I'm not a fan of ""forced"" clipping though, so only two mines are clipped where it feels ""natural"" to me)
* no buying/selling to NPC or throwing away goods
* no limitations on influence (I have the stadium in case I need more)
* Bonus : produce as many arctic reports as possible
* Bonus : produce feathers/bear fur/meat for Enbesa/Investors/Tourists respectively

The mains issues to do so are :

* to produce schnaps, you can only rely on charcoal with Gl√∏gg Splurger which produces 1t every 2.5 min, so you need to burn **a lot** of coal (contrary to many arctic layouts, we thus don't need any wood as heating material)
* the only source of canned food is Pemmican Cookhouse with The Uncanny Pocket Cannery, so you need to eat **a lot** of pemmican
* you can't produce brass, so you need to use the copper from the gas mines to produce the Oil Lamps with the Fat Chunk Candle Maker (you can also get a few from the Pemmican Cookhouse, but it's nowhere near enough to sustain a thriving village)
* you need a bit of population to produce any significant arctic reports amount and operate the gas mines

**1 - Main Island**

This is the main production island. It has most of the production buildings, with items to boost them. We keep the number of technicians on this island below 300 so they don't require advanced stuff like canned food, which is reserved for gas plateaus. Using items to reduce workforce, it's not an issue to make all parka and sleds factories running

[Main island](https://preview.redd.it/ye1gslwne5wd1.png?width=3300&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7aa199fb98781b8dc289dcb7df63b97df26d5a2)

**2 - Seal Island**

A very small island used basically only for seal and coal. We keep the population under 100 so they don't require anything beside the public buildings. No postal service here as it takes too much workforce. I also use the extra \~1.8 t/min feathers produced by the item exclusively for lifestyle needs in Enbesa instead of shipping it to the main island as there already are enough.

[Seal island](https://preview.redd.it/zq8147b4g5wd1.png?width=2086&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe5c061c77ddd440beb6b07971f5be48ecdcb88)

**3 - ""Population"" island**

This one is a bit special. It does not manufacture anything. It's basically just 3000 explorers being there just to sink excess Pemmican production to keep the canned food flowing. As it's a big population hub, it's also the main contributor to the arctic reports production. This island is the only one not using local mail as lifestyle needs, as it allows to overflow all the other islands with more than enough regional mail without having to tweak the roads amounts (take all what you can from this island, send it to another one, repeat with the next island). As we don't use any coastal space, I also use it as the main storage place for all productions  


[Population island](https://preview.redd.it/041ofm69p5wd1.png?width=4212&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffb65219580fda87cf11e2b09409fc9e96f9734)

**4 - Gas plateau 1**

This is the simplest one, all houses have their own arctic lodge with the items, postal office specialist shares a lodge with a mine. There is one mine clipped as it's very natural here (don't need to build an extra mine with a single extractor or moving the lodge to weird locations).

[First plateau](https://preview.redd.it/z3w8zb8hi5wd1.png?width=2202&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ee80f0dd8a9c99925383c6f188ae6119f2be5d8)

**5 - Gas plateau 2**

The second plateau has all the huskies production, so we need a few more technician houses here (35 instead of 30 with the radiators boosting the workforce). Given the fact that we don't use all the sleds, I think we could keep only 3 husky farms, but it's not a big difference with the -50% from the Astute Dog-Breeder anyway.

[Second plateau](https://preview.redd.it/oxpuq3jkj5wd1.png?width=2042&format=png&auto=webp&s=c217e250f21b3c3f3645cb1ac2d87100bbc24183)

**6 - Gas plateau 3**

Thrid plateau, the one with a weird long shape. Things to note here: we can't fit all the technicians in the radiators area, so we need one more house. On the far left, we can't fit all the extractors with a single mine, so we build two but with clipping to compensate for the extra workforce we had to use.

[Third plateau](https://preview.redd.it/pk4tglu5k5wd1.png?width=4122&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6c4b9c45ecb335466923c53a747565af4df0d72)

**7 - Gas plateau 4**

Last plateau, nothing special for the gas, but also contains the feather production, which requires more technicians. They can't all fit in the radiator area but it's not a big deal as we need houses to sink the extra pemmican anyway. However, they still all fit in the postal office radius.

[Fourth plateau](https://preview.redd.it/nzrt3lmgl5wd1.png?width=3062&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe5977461b8dedcdda6828e0ae3677502c814f9)

And that's it. The whole thing runs flawlessly with no extra inputs (the only thing you need to make sure is that the arctic gas is exported, otherwise you won't get copper to create the oil lamps). Here is the final production stats for the whole region:

[Final production rates, we're missing a few huskies, but as we don't consume all the sleds it doesn't cause any issue](https://preview.redd.it/c48odz0085wd1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba0494736b5275e07bd55a8c4b5ac7e5d9cd7aff)

I guess there are still some minor things that I could try to min/max but for now, I'm pretty pleased on how this turned out. The production rate for reports is \~8t/min which is not that much due to the poor production rate (1 every 3rd cycle). If I need more bear fur or meat, I will just transfer some technicians houses to a new island (in priority the ones that are not in range of the postal service to maximize arctic reports production). That should keep the consumption constant for all my arctic needs. As all the supply lines already exist it's fairly easy to do. For the heating, there are \~9t of wood already available with the zappy battery or I think I can still squeeze one or two lower rate coal kiln in the range of the Gl√∏gg Splurger and maybe some others without the item here and there on the existing islands

Note : if you don't care about arctic reports, you can probably skip island 3 and just dump/sell the extra pemmican and use wood instead of coal on some of the plateaus to simplify things, you may have some schnaps shortage though

Note : if you want to maximize the gas extraction with clipping, you'll probably need more technicians. In this case, you need to keep the explorer/technician house ratio to 3:1 for the canned food supply to be viable (technician houses on an island with less than 300 technicians count as 2 explorer for this calculation as they don't consume any canned food).",21,1729536556.0,anno1800,3,1.0,False

Also this is a throwaway account.

My grandmother passed away last year.  She was well into her late 80s and basically raised my brother and I from the early 90s after our parents divorced.  We were preteens at the time and we'd spent a significant amount of time with her our entire lives.  She had only been married once and we had never seen her involved in any sort of relationship.  She divorced her ex-husband in the 1950s after having 2 boys, my father and my uncle.  The claim our entire lives has been that my grandfather was a gigantic butthole and treated her like crap, so we were distanced from him.  I maybe met the guy once or twice in my entire life (currently in my mid 40s) and never had any meaningful connection to him other than my last name.  My father also distanced himself and never would let us see him.  My uncle passed away several years ago.  He had a basic relationship with my grandfather, but he kept his kids away from him.  He had a very peculiar middle name and no one knew where this name came from.  It wasn't a super common name for the area and wasn't a family name, so we figured that our grandmother had seen it in a book and liked it.  For clarity, my father is 3ish years older than my uncle.

Up until my grandmother's passing, the aforementioned paragraph was considered fact and basically everything that we thought we knew.  Summarized, she divorced in the mid 1950s and never found or sought a relationship again.  We'd believed all of the abuse stories and never dug deeper.

Weeks before my grandmother passed, my brother and his wife, who were local to her, were checking on her.  They visited her weekly to make sure she had her meds and groceries and anything else she needed.  During this specific visit, she made sure to tell them that something valuable was under the house (crawlspace) in coffee cans.  She specifically said where to find the cans.  We had used the crawlspace as storage for our entire lives.  It's worth mentioning that she bought this house new in the early 70s.  The crawlspace was tall enough to walk in because the house was on a hill.  It was full of a lifetime's worth of junk...broken toys, random furniture and yard tools, etc.  All that to say, you'd have to know where something was if you wanted to find it because there was so much other stuff blocking the way.

My brother kept this info about there being something valuable under the house.  My grandmother was not the type to let anyone snoop around the house and had grown highly suspicious.  We made an assumption that it was probably money or maybe some deposit account info.  She had worked in the back office at a very large bank in the closest major city, so she was very particular about money and the handling of it.

Upon her passing, my brother shared this info with me and we talked about how to go about finding the coffee cans and stuff.  Before we could take a single step in that direction, there was another discovery directly beside her bed.  She had moved what looked like an antique sewing kit to be beside her bed.  This is not something that was ever kept out in the open and stood out as an item worth investigating.  I had already gone back home, 3 hours away, after the initial purge of items.  Remember we had lived here for our middle and high school years, so we both had our own personal items to rummage through in order to get the house ready to sell.

My brother opened this sewing kit and called me.  There were Christmas cards and a couple of letters contained in it.  They were from the early 50s and were to/from a man whose first name matched my uncle's middle name.  The dates within the letters were while my ""grandfather"" was away in the Korean war.  There were also a couple of letters to/from my grandfather.  This seemed like a gigantic eye-opening moment where we found out that maybe there was another connection, but since we only had 4 or 5 letters and cards to go on, it was ruled just a coincidence.  Like maybe she had named my uncle after a friend of hers.

The following weekend, my brother went into the crawl space and found the coffee cans.  At some point, my grandmother had moved them closer to the opening to the crawl space.  This had to have been done years prior because she was unable to walk without a walker for the last few years of her life.  The first coffee can was several bags of Liberty dollars and other various old coins.  None of these turned out to be of significant value.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cans, however, were a treasure trove of love letters that completely flipped our viewpoint of our grandmother upside down.

Now at this point, I need to be clear that our father is still alive and doesn't know these things exist.  These coffee cans were full of love letters, starting around 1950 and going throughout the 50s.  There was a series of letters from my ""grandfather"" from when he was in Korea.  There was also a series of letters from another man, we'll call him JohnDoe here.   This was the same man from the sewing kit letters.  The same man whose first name matched my uncle's middle name.  The letters from my grandfather indicated that he knew my grandmother was seeing someone else, but he didn't know who it was.  For the sake of the timeline, the letters from my grandfather start in 1949 and he was discharged from Korea in August 1951.  They got married on the base the day he returned to the states, august 1951.  The letters from JohnDoe start in mid 1950 and he says he's leaving for basic training in May 1951.  My father was born in February 1952.  The letters from JohnDoe are definitely love letters between 2 people who are romantically involved.  The language is not what you would see friends using.  And even upon reading through my father's baby book, JohnDoe is referred to as ""uncle JohnDoe"".  There's talk of him buying my grandmother a christmas tree in December 1950.

So as we piece this together, it's becoming more and more clear that my father's father is potentially JohnDoe instead of the man that we'd known as my grandfather.  If you piece May 1951 plus 9 months, it would be February 1952.  The baby book indicates a full sized, healthy baby in the 8-9 pound range.  My ""grandfather"" didn't get back from Korea until August 1951.  That would yield a 6 month pregnancy and very likely a premature baby, which wouldn't be anywhere near 9 pounds.  Also, knowing that my ""grandfather"" was very slow and not extremely bright, it makes sense that he wouldn't think anything different of a 9 pound baby being born at 6 months.  JohnDoe's letters eventually break off and he married someone else when he returned from his service.  My grandmother separated from my grandfather a few times and ultimately divorced him in the late 50s.

Now we can move into how difficult it is to prove any of this.  My ""grandfather"" died 15 years ago and we don't have any sort of relationship with anyone from his second marriage.  We also wouldn't want to kick that anthill with the suggestion that my Grandmother cheated on him while he was in Korea.  That would open a whole new can of worms.  My uncle had 2 daughters, so no sons to compare DNA to.  He also passed away 10ish years ago.  Numerous searches of what remains of his properties yielding nothing of value that could be used for a DNA test.  He had remarried not too long before his death and ruined his relationship with his daughters.  His new wife purged everything when he passed away.  So what does that leave us?  Ancestry dot com and social media.  I dug through looking for JohnDoe's military records and could see which bases he was at.  I eventually was able to see that he had 3 boys that were still alive.  I looked to facebook and found them.  They heavily favor my father.  My uncle has zero feature-traits that match my father.  I reached out to all of these men months ago and haven't received any replies from them.  I've reached out to them several times.  I even tried to ping their spouses, all via social media.  They are the only way, in my mind, that we can prove that mine and my brother's family history is different than we've ever been told.

So there it is.... My grandmother.  This beacon of truth that lived 70 years without a partner.  She held onto this secret that had to be eating her alive.  She knew this entire time that my father had a different dad than the one she'd told everyone.  And i can only imagine how hard that was for her to hide.  My ""grandfather"" very likely would have killed her if it ever came out.  Our entire family would have ostracized her and shut her out.  She lived 70 years without the man that she said ""was the love of her life"" in the love letters.  We could have had a real grandfather.  She could have had a real life partner.  Instead she died as stubborn as she lived and I respect the hell out of her for it.  I can't imagine sacrificing and being so lonely.  She was always loyal to her kids and grandkids.  She always made it a point to be part of my own kids' lives.  We got to see her a month before she passed.  She visited us for Christmas and talked about how it was the best Christmas ever all the way back home, 3 hours away.  Looking back, it almost feels like she knew the end was so near.  I wish every day that she would have just told us.  We have so many questions and so few answers.

And in case there are comments asking why we haven't told anyone else, specifically my father.... Her estate is still in limbo and we very much need for him to not freak out and burn down her house or rage out on us.  We both feel and believe that he would lose his mind and lash out.  We plan on telling him after her estate is settled.  Up until then, he has to be in the dark so we can keep him from doing anything stupid.

tldr... all genealogy is bullshit because anyone could say anything they wanted prior to DNA tests being able to confirm things.  Records were scarce and anyone could be anyone.  We always hear about WW2 soldiers fudging their age and enlisting before they were 18.  It was as easy as lying.

edit to add an interesting point.... my father's first name is the same as my ""grandfather's"" first name, lets say Roger, but my father's father is likely named JohnDoe.  My uncle's middle name is the same as my father's portential father, JohnDoe.  So neither of my grandmother's sons were named after the man that fathered them...they were both named after the ""other man""......probably.",5,1729536324.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.86,False

I've seen him on tinder/dating apps like Hinge and clearly he can see me. I've never swiped left or right on him and I don't want to say no but I'm scared it will be a match and what then. I'd prefer for things to happen in real life but have tried a gazillion times to accidently on purpose bump into him and haven't been successful. I have noticed that if I take a break/pause my profile and come back his also seems to then hide and come back which I think might either be weird or coincidence? A few months ago he had someone in to paint his garden gate and this inspired me to do the same a few weeks later. Then he changed his prompt on the app to he was looking for someone who liked painting garden gates. I don't know was this just a reference to himself or was this just a subtle hint to me?
He is never home before 10.30pm at night and I feel it's late to knock with an excuse and I'm also a bit scared... I'd be fine if he appeared in front of me I could chat away then but the idea of knocking on the door terrifies me!!
I used to be a shy person and have more or less got over it but can still be a bit shy especially when it comes to making a move. 
But this is torture. I don't know how to make a move or get over this crush. Help.",1,1729536010.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

I‚ÄôM BAAAAAAACK!!

Did you miss me? What do you mean, no? There I was, expecting to come through the metaphorical door to see you all there, waving your phone torches in the air, singing Take That‚Äôs *Back For Good*! To be honest, I‚Äôm kind of glad. That probably would have been worse than when HOTH and I told the DJ to announce we were leaving the wedding reception to go back to the hotel and he genuinely, with a straight face, said ‚ÄòAw, but I was going to get you up on stage and have everyone sing ‚Äò*Angels‚Äô* to you‚Äô. To this day I have no clue why he thought that would be a good idea but, given The Look from me, he probably never mentioned it again. I mean, really?

Well, I had an extremely wonderful ~~several bottles of wine~~ spa break with my friends and returned refreshed on the Sunday to watch BOTH the Saturday show *and* the ‚ÄòSunday‚Äô one after the other without suffering any disastrous time-travel paradoxes. Maybe Strictly Bosses could think on‚Äôt? Or maybe it‚Äôs the Beeb Bosses filling our screens with more padding than a DFS weekend sale.

Speaking of padding, we did finally get to see Nick‚Äôs Paddington Charleston last week, missed from Movie Week. Oh ‚Äì see what I did there? Apologies for anyone who got whiplash from that less-than-smooth segue. He tried, bless him, but he was still something like 85% injury, strapping and painkillers. Which sounds like a normal Saturday for me. Even with the extra few days‚Äô training it was, as we expected, more Care Home than Charleston. The judges were not swayed by Luba‚Äôs drawn-on cute nose and bear ears made of hair and they went home. I suppose being in the dance off with the cheesy human chocolate lime that was Shayne ‚Äì bewildered being in the Dance Off ‚Äì was always going to be a clue the glitterball did NOT have Nick‚Äôs name on.

**What A Shame - Shayne Was In The Dance Off Lime Light**

But that was then, and this is now. It‚Äôs business as usual for us from here on to the end. No more weekends away leaving HOTH to fend for himself and you to pine for me words of wisdom. Well, unless I win Euromillions, that is. Then you‚Äôre all on your own.

This week the couples were all vying for a coveted place in the Halloween Special ‚Äì probably the second favourite one for them after beloved Blackpool. It‚Äôs certainly where hair, make up and wardrobe really come into their own (careful now), even if we‚Äôve already heard the songs a billion times before. I suppose there‚Äôs only so many you can shoe-horn into a spooky themed show. Oh, and how much are we betting Craig gets introduced as ‚ÄòCraig Devil Horwood‚Äô again? Ah, but I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself ‚Äì we had this week‚Äôs show to sit through first.

The opening segment was a quick cover of the couples‚Äô daily training. I don‚Äôt know what they moan about ‚Äì from that VT it looks like it‚Äôs all just lying down and getting coffees. Even I can do that. A quick scan of the audience showed Oti had popped in for a chinwag with her sister as well as Giant from Gladiators. Now, that *would* be a fun pairing. Five foot four, nine stone Oti with six foot five, twenty stone Giant getting to grips with a tango. He could lose her in his bum crack and never know.

**Oti Be Partnered With A Giant Like This**

Kicking off the show, quite literally, were **JB and Amy** with their **Jive** to **Hey Ya**! by **Outkast**. Well, of *course* they were going to hammer Polaroid pictures and cameras into everything. From Amy taking photos of JB‚Äôs positions for future reference (now, now) to incorporating a camera into the routine. Yes, we get it! ‚ÄòShake it like a Polaroid picture‚Äô. Good job they weren‚Äôt dancing to flipping Firestarter.

JB started off pretty well. He had some good energy throughout a fast-paced dance with lots of tricky content. His kicks and flicks were pretty clean and the retraction was fairly good. He had bags of stamina, timing and musicality and he was mostly in sync with Amy in the side-by-side sections. Unfortunately, his weight was a bit too far back, meaning his balance was off and led to stompy, heavy, claggy feet. Lots of constructive feedback from the Judges and **30 out of 40** on the paddles.

**Andre Say JB Can‚Äôt Dance!**

Up next were **Punam and Gorka** slowing things down with their **Viennese Waltz** to **She‚Äôs Always A Woman To Me** by **Billy Joel**. The bloke can probably retire from the PRS royalty cheques he gets from Strictly using this number. Punam‚Äôs wee lad showed up in her VT watching her and Gorka rehearse and what a sweet young man he is. All shiny teeth and wobbly eyes as he watched mum being spun around the floor. It‚Äôs starting to show now that Punam suffers with the nerves and jitters as she dances on show night. She seemed to retreat into herself for this dance, becoming meek and a bit hesitant as the routine went on. It was a sweet, romantic number and her connection with Gorka was better, but with her frock reminding me of someone pouring a jug of custard, it all got a bit lumpy. Her footwork was patchy ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt close her feet half as much as she needed to ‚Äì and her steps were too short, meaning Gorka was in danger of running her over in parts. To ~~mangle~~ quote Scots poet Robert Burns, her frame *aft gang agley* and you could see her thinking about it too much. Just **21 out of 40** for our dancing doctor this week.

**Punam Had The Flow Of School Dinner Custard This Week**

¬†Now, if you‚Äôve read any of my prattle before, you‚Äôll know that my absolute, most favourite Latin dance is the Paso Doble so I get very twitchy when the male celebs are asked to do it (see Pete in Week One). Well, I needn‚Äôt have worried with **Jamie and Michelle‚Äôs Paso Doble** to **Malague√±a** by **Ernesto Lecuona** ‚Äì a classic Paso tune if ever there was one. Despite looking like a vertical Viennetta, Jamie *owned* this dance from the first note to the last. There was some guff in the VT about Michelle getting Jamie in the right mood by telling him to pretend someone had pinched his lemons. Whatever works, I suppose, but this was a very, very different Jamie to the Cheeky Chappy we‚Äôre used to. He was mean, moody, powerful, even arrogant as he charged across the floor. There was so much attack, command, drama and intent ‚Äì whether he was in hold with Michelle or in solo spots (which included the difficult knee walks at the start). Michelle‚Äôs choreography was jaw-droppingly difficult, including fragolinos ‚Äì a series of up to 28 intricate, intertwined steps (although Jamie only did eight) ‚Äì which pleased Shirl no end. He had fabulous flamenco feet and arms, near perfect posture and gave a fearless performance that was more believable than anything he‚Äôs done on EastEnders ‚Äì not that I actually watch it myself. Too much shouting and bovver. It was simply spectacular and I had to watch it again just to take it all in. With Craig declaring it ‚ÄòPaso-bleeding-tastic‚Äô he was awarded a near-perfect **39 out of 40**.

**Jamie Gets His Just Desserts**

Following this explosion of a dance were **Chris and Dianne**¬†with a **Waltz** to **You‚Äôll Never Walk Alone** by **Gerry and the Pacemakers.** Well, come on! You must have known this was coming ‚Äì this song is practically the Scouse National Anthem, after all and means so much to the city, including Chris who found the experience emotional. This was conveyed through the dance routine as he and Dianne swept gracefully around the ballroom. With Chris in a red shirt and Dianne in blue dress to bring both halves of Liverpool together, this was a lovely dance to watch. Chris‚Äô footwork is simply exquisite ‚Äì he closed his feet beautifully, there were natural and reverse turns, heel leads and turns and blimmin‚Äô great fleckerl in there. His hands were nicely shaped, thumb tucked down, and his soft knees gave him drive across the floor. He still needs work on maintaining his frame throughout a routine as, again, it started to wobble and flop about, his left elbow drooping and dipping. Craig whinged that it lacked swing and sway ‚Äì leading Chris to quip ‚Äòthat beard doesn‚Äôt suit you and even I know that!‚Äô Wibbly frame aside, a very impressive **35 out of 40** on the Leaderboard.

**Buswell Does Well With Chris**

¬†**Tasha and Alja≈æ**¬†took on a **Tango** to **Dog Days Are Over** by **Florence + The Machine** (or That Really Shouty Loud Woman as she‚Äôs known in our house. Florence, that is, not Tasha). I think it‚Äôs fair to say Tasha didn‚Äôt enjoy this dance as much as the previous ones she‚Äôs done. She started off well with a decent frame and core, some good attack and intent and some fair drive through her knees. There was a smattering of staccato head moves and some fair footwork in a very fast routine that went off at breakneck speed and didn‚Äôt stop. Well, until the end of course. She tried hard with the attack needed for this dance but, for me, it needed a soupcon more intent. Something seemed to go wrong towards the end, though. She lost focus, her frame went loose and her legs came out from their requisite positioning for a good Tango. It might not have been her best, but she still impressed the panel enough to earn **34 out of 40**.

**Argh Me Bloody Foot, Tasha!!**

¬†Having thankfully read my requests to stop giving **Paul and Karen** (ahem) ‚Äòcomedy‚Äô routines, the Strictly Powers That Be decided upon a **Samba** to **Car Wash** by **Rose Royce**. Karen had choreographed a disco-style routine and while nobody will ever mistake Paul for John Travolta he gave it a Bloody Good Go. He had some actual bounce, timing and rhythm, even being on beat and in time with Karen ‚Äì whether accidentally or not, they never said. He seemed to be having loads of fun and while Karen still did a lot of the distraction dancing around him, flinging her fringing around for all she was worth, he at least tried the hip movements, shimmies and basic steps. His arms looked like he was asking a bus to stop most of the time as he fair flung them out to the sides and he stood still a bit too often. His feet were turned in and he lost direction a couple of times. He is improving week on week, though and I enjoyed it. Pity Craig didn‚Äôt, scoring it a miserable 3 ‚Äì leading Paul to invite him to The Emirates on Monday for football training and see how good *he* is by Tuesday. A Leaderboard low of **19 out of 40**.

**Karen Shimmy Shields Paul‚Äôs Poor Performance**

**Sam and Nikita** finally got the pun-dance we‚Äôve been waiting for with their **Quekstep** (sorry) to **Unwritten** by **Natasha Bedingfield**. And life would be better if the song remained so. Ah, forgive the curmudgeon, I jest. Although, after Saturday night, Sam was probably thinking the same. While her VT showed her cosying up at home with her children and husband ‚Äì who I thought was Jake Shears from Sister Sisters for a minute until I remembered the obvious ‚Äì she was far from cosy on the dancefloor. She looked beautiful and elegant in her lilac ostrich feathered dress but, unfortunately, this didn‚Äôt translate to the routine. It started off swift, clippy and swish with some nice opening steps and choreography. However, a couple of errors got into Sam‚Äôs head and you could see the tension in her frame as her shoulder went increasingly higher. Her footwork and frame faltered and there was more gapping than at a London Underground railway station. She seemed to struggle with the pace and changes of direction, seemingly forgetting to breathe. She was obviously upset and disappointed with herself, feeling she had let Nikita down. Just **26 out of 40** for the pair this week.

**Will The Real Mr Sam Quek Please Stand Up?**

Judges‚Äô Punch Up Of The Night came courtesy of **Pete and Jowita‚Äôs Rumba** to **Don‚Äôt Look Back In Anger** by **Oasis**. Honestly, it was like a Gallagher Family Christmas Party! Pete and Jowita were somewhat unfathomably soaking for this dance ‚Äì the poor bloke looked like he‚Äôd been in the shower and been shouted out last minute to get on the floor. He said he felt like an otter at the end he was certainly wetter than an otter‚Äôs pocket as he traipsed gamely around the floor. His sultry, sensual character worked well and he‚Äôs worked hard on his timing and musicality. His rhythm wasn‚Äôt too bad and he‚Äôs been practising finishing his lines more. He still needs to work on the transitions, though, and join the dots to make a routine flow better although Pete did manage the tricky knee spin lift thingy that Jowita had thrown in, too. And the lifts were part of the problem. They‚Äôre not allowed in a Rumba and one foot must stay on the floor at all times, but Jowita had chucked three in. Craig marked the pair down even further for that, saying they would have been disqualified in any other dance competition. It‚Äôs a difficult dance at the best of times for the male celebs without all that malarkey, but Pete at least had had a go at the hip isolation and figure of eight hips ‚Äì which was the cause of the kick off between Craig and Shirl coming over all unnecessary at Pete‚Äôs opening figure eight. Still, despite an overmarked 7 from Tony Beak (probably to pee the grown-ups off), they scored just **22 out of 40**.

**Pete‚Äôs Got A Whole Otter Shaking Going On**

Having to come on after that spat were **Sarah and Vito** with a sparky **Samba** to **Do It Do It Again** by **Rafaella Carr√†**. With her change of hair and make up for this number, I thought Toyah had come back for a minute. Then the dance started and it was obvious she hadn‚Äôt, because it was good. Portraying a party-girl tourist, Sarah laid on a sassy, spicy, sexy character, getting to grips with Vito and his lemons (so *that‚Äôs* who nicked ‚Äòem off Jamie!). As we‚Äôve some to expect, Sarah really put oomph into her performance with a larger than life character, selling it to the seats in the nosebleeds. There was some really difficult choreography from Vito and some very impressive moves with tricky technique. Sarah was having a whale of the time as she shimmied and sashayed around the dance floor. She does still need to work on her feet and tidy up her toes, which had a tendency to turn in. She also seemed to be trying to stop the same bus as Paul with her flingy, flappy arms. Still, a decent **32 out of 40** for the pair.

Last week‚Äôs Dance Off Survivors **Shayne and Nancy** returned with an **American Smooth** to **Get Here** by ‚Ä¶ **Sam Smith**? Erm, **Oleta Adams** actually, if you don‚Äôt mind! Sam flipping Smith. Psshht. The nerve. It was Shayne‚Äôs 40^(th) birthday this week, so they wheeled out his mum, wife and a birthday cake for him in the training room, which moved him to tears. His mum, that is, not the cake. I‚Äôm not sure of his baked goods proclivities. What I am sure of, though, it that he‚Äôs a dead ringer for Benny from Crossroads in that woolly hat he wears (Google if you need to). This was a dance of two halves ‚Äì well, two thirds, really. Shayne started off nicely, his footwork was nice and neat, he pretty much maintained his frame throughout and his leading of Nancy is improving. He coped well with the lifts, including a ‚Äòtrust me‚Äô jump and catch which made me wonder how many times he‚Äôd dropped Nancy in training ‚Äì especially as he telegraphed one lift with a huge ‚ÄòYep, I‚Äôm ready‚Äô nod. There was good flow to the routine, but he still struggles getting in and out of hold. His solo spots are a bit ‚Ä¶ big, still. All a bit ‚ÄòMum, mum! Look at me! Mum!‚Äô So when he gets back with Nancy it all goes more quiet and subdued. Consistency, Mr Ward. Consistency. With Shirl going off a bit early with her paddle, **31 out of 40** was awarded.

**Is Shayne At A Dancing Crossroads?**

**Wynne and** **Katya** were back in the penultimate spot with their **Quickstep** to **Mr Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)**. Yet more anniversary break trauma for HOTH and I. A beautiful, if soggy, weekend in The Lake District was somewhat marred by the hotel only having one CD to play at dinner - The Best of ELO ‚Äì which they played all night, every night. It was like being in Groundhog Day or summat. So Mr Blue Sky and the rest set me twitches off.

Apparently, Wynne and Katya had to take to the socials, press and Strictly: It Takes Two last week to annihilate the Neterati (aka feckwits with nothing better to do) trying to spread rumours of ‚Äòinappropriate behaviour‚Äô by Wynne, fall-outs, tantrums and tiffs. People really, *really*, need to get a life and stop making up vile rumours about things they know less than the square root of nowt about, in order to get ‚Äòlikes‚Äô, ‚Äòupvotes‚Äô and ~~attention~~ stuff. These are real people and their lives they‚Äôre trying to besmirch. My nan had a word for these folk. Unfortunately, it would get me a lifetime reddit ban, so I‚Äôd best not repeat it here.

Luckily, Wynne (looking a bit like a Pound Shop Mr Tumble), shook off the shenanigans with a fun, frivolous dance, packed full of tricks and gags ‚Äì all of which were perfectly timed and landed spot on. Wynne‚Äôs poor accident prone character broke his door, sat on wet paint, got loo roll stuck on his shoe and had a bird poo on his head. As I said earlier, a normal Saturday night for me. Wynne is so light on his feet for a larger chap and he bounded across the floor like Skippy on ‚Äòsteds. His sync, timing and musicality were spot on and he had plenty of stamina to get through the dance ‚Äì apart from a quick sit down for the paint gag. There were a couple of issues with his frame in hold, and the correct placing of Katya, but overall, the Judges liked it and gave the pair **33 out of 40**.

**Wynne Shows Us Something Special**

**Montell** and **Johannes** ended the show with a rip-roaring, spectacular **Couple's Choice** to **Skeleton Move by KG and Zanda Zakuza**, which contains the lyrics ‚ÄòWanitwa Mos‚Äô. Thanks to my poor addled old ears, I was convinced Tommy and Co were singing ‚ÄòWanna Eat A Mousse‚Äô or possibly ‚ÄòMoose‚Äô. I blame growing up with mono radio stations ‚Äì why else would I believe The Bee Gees were asking their love to ‚Äòcome to me on a submarine ‚Ä¶ when the auction let us bid‚Äô? Anyway, thankfully, Montell and JoJo were very far from addled. My word, what an absolute belter of a routine. A fusion of African & Caribbean styles they tore up the floor, starting in gorgeous African-print costumes, swiftly changing to full on Notting Hill Carnival gear that properly brought the party atmosphere to the studio. Montell had so much energy, rhythm, musicality and style in a routine packed with content, including cartwheels and flagography (my spellcheck was *not* happy with this word). Her utter joy and enthusiasm for this dance radiated as she stayed in time, on beat and in sync withJoJo from start to finish. Despite being such a fast number, her stamina never flagged and the couple looked like they were having the absolute time of their lives. And so were we all. This utter firework display of a routine scored the couple the second **39 out of 40** of the night.

**Sparklers Fly For Montell And Johannes**

And there we were, done. All twelve couples had shown us what they had and the Leaderboard looked like this:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Jamie and Michelle = 39

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Montell and Johannes = 39

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chris and Dianne = 35

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tasha¬†and Alja≈æ = 34

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Wynne and Katya = 33

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sarah and Vito = 32

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Shayne and Nancy = 31

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† JB and Amy = 30

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sam and Nikita = 26

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pete and Jowita = 22

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Punam and Gorka = 21

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Paul and Karen = 19

Saturday turned into Sunday, as it is wont to do, and we all play along. Besides, showing it all on one night would either mean it‚Äôd have to start going out about 4pm or go on until gone midnight. Though the poor audience are ~~captive~~ there for the whole thing.

There was usual recap and behind the scenes bit, with Chris telling screen-bombing Shayne to ‚Äòget his own VT‚Äô after he‚Äôd popped up in at least three. Another Judge‚Äôs Huddle and we were down to the business of the night.

In slightly more time than it took to form The Grand Canyon, Tess put us out of our collective misery by telling us that the first couple in the Elimination Zone were ‚Ä¶

**JB AND AMY**

What the what now? Unless the Humans At Home didn‚Äôt vote for the couple because every one of them thought someone else would, this was a baffling announcement. They had got good feedback from the Judges and had made a decent attempt at a Jive. Oh, well. The fickle public strike again, I suppose. Being mid-table can never guarantee safety. As Motsi and Craig commented, the viewers fall in love with the celebs, the dancers and their journeys (for a while at least) regardless of them having the dance ability of a mushroom. All to play for then, JB!

¬†Up in the Clauditorium, **Shayne** was just grateful not to be in the bottom two again, but then launched into a nauseating duet with Nancy, presumably to remind people he is a singer, which almost made be demand a recount.

**Wynne** told us that the lovely ladies in Cardiff decorate the rehearsal room and leave cakes. He‚Äôs also been teaching Katya Welsh. *Diolch* in fact, which means thank you. With any luck next week will be ‚Äò*‚ÄôRydych chi'n drewi o winwns‚Äô* ¬†to Craig (you KNOW you want to Google that).

**Pete**, still soaking, was happy to be through to Halloween, when he‚Äôs going to portray The Joker ‚Äì which version, though?

**Montell** feels weird being called by here real name, and JoJo is going to be moving in for her mum‚Äôs cooking.

But **Chris** reckons Montell‚Äôs mum would NOT allow him out in that Carnival outfit, and can‚Äôt believe The Beeb allows so much flesh on show.

One quick plug for Halloween later and we were thrilled, delighted and utterly spoiled by a Pro Group Paso Doble choreographed by the wonderful Strictly ex, Oti Mabuse. Vito was magnificently macho and HOTH reliably informs me there were other dancers there too. I‚Äôm kidding! Leads Vito, Nikita, Nancy and Dianne were stunningly good, supported with skill by the rest of the pros. And, I‚Äôm so, so sorry ‚Äì and I know he‚Äôs won World Championships and all that - but I just can‚Äôt take Neil seriously doing all the Paso faces ‚Äì he looks like a miffed squirrel getting his nuts in a tangle.

**Neil Gets Narky**

There was another conflab with the Judges not really adding much to what they‚Äôd said last night, earlier and in the huddle, except we got a tiny explanation of a fragolino without Anton squawking like a plucked duck every two seconds.

A Giant Sequoia tree grew from seed to maturity during Round Two of The Daly Drivel until we finally found out JB and Amy would be up against ‚Ä¶.

**PAUL AND KAREN**

This was less surprising than the previous pair. They WERE at the bottom of the leaderboard on Saturday and, while Paul has been improving, it‚Äôs not been at the same level as the rest of the contestants this year ‚Äì which is a pretty strong cast, if Week Four and Five 10s being bandied about tells you anything. He appeared to be a mix of sanguine, relieved and disappointed at the same time because he has been enjoying dancing and working with Karen. But it‚Äôs not over until all Judges had cast their die, Paul. Stranger things have happened in Strictly Land.

Back in the Winkle Wonderland (sorry, it‚Äôs the best I could come up with at short notice), we learned **Jamie** begs Michelle to let him warm up with their Rumba ‚Äì but he‚Äôs announced he now wants to switch to the Paso, and I don‚Äôt blame him.

**Sarah‚Äôs** mum ‚ÄòBeaky‚Äô gets mithered by fans to such an extent she can no longer mooch around John Lewis‚Äô in Cheadle without harassment. I had the same in our local Lidl when I‚Äôd been on Crimewatch. Sorry, Pointless. Easy to confuse the two.

**Sam** will now unfortunately miss her friends‚Äô wedding, as she thought she‚Äôd have been booted off weeks ago. She‚Äôs going to send a round of Jagerbombs as consolation. Jagerbombs, Shmagerbombs. It was a Depth Charge when I were a lass ‚Äì a full shot glass of Pernod dropped (glass and all) into a pint of cider. And you wonder why I‚Äôm like I am!

**Punam** has got a busy week ahead with GP work, TV work, training, Halloween and Diwali ‚Äì already desperately wondering how to meld the two celebrations for her kids. Good luck with that one, Punam.

**Tasha** was so convinced she was going to be in the dance off she was mentally going through the steps again. Luckily, she lives to dance another day, and the wardrobe staff get another go at bedazzling her cochlear implant to match her costume.

¬†Former Strictly Contestant Sophie Ellis-Bextor provided the musical interlude with her new ditty *Freedom of the Night*. I am that old I remember her mum being pregnant with Sophie‚Äôs brother and rumours of her being made to leave Blue Peter because she was an unmarried mother. All piffle, of course, which goes to show that there has always been folk happy to make up sh‚Ä¶ rubbish about people. Wynne & Katya had to YET AGAIN explain the reason he hadn‚Äôt been in the Clauditorium with her at times on Saturday night was NOTHING to do with some imagined tiff, but to mend a ~~trouser~~ wardrobe malfunction. Honestly, I‚Äôm going to root these weirdos out and tell their mums on them, you watch!

And so to the Dance Off.

Oh heck! Nerves had very clearly got to **JB** and he was rattled from the off. Mistake after mistake in the first half at least meaning he was at different parts of the routine to Amy, who had to hurriedly try to cover up his fluffs. He did settle down in the first kicks and flicks side-by-side section, but he‚Äôd certainly not done himself any favours. Had he gifted Paul another week?

**Paul** took his place on the dancefloor once more. This time round he seemed to give it some more energy and oomph, his bounce was better and there was a smidge more hip action. Unfortunately, he also went a bit wrong, lost timing and couldn‚Äôt get it back before the end. What a palaver for the Panel.

Tricky as it was, the Judges placed their weight more heavily behind the dancer who had had better timing and got back on track. They unanimously decided who to save and the couple going home were ‚Ä¶

**PAUL AND KAREN**

As Radiohead sang, Karma Police. No, sorry, No Alarms And No Surprises. Not for us, the Judges or the couple. I think Paul looked a bit relieved to be getting his lie-ins back. I know the feeling. Never was I more relieved than when YMOTH announced he wanted to give up Sunday morning rugby. Congleton will *never* be forgotten <thousand yard stare into the middle distance>.

And so, that was that for Week Five. Our Dancing Dozen have been pared down to Legs & Co Eleven. Here we go now to get ready for Halloween Week ‚Äì be prepared for ghosties, ghoulies, long-leggedy beasties and some truly awful puns, and that‚Äôs just me.

¬†Until then, my little pickled walnuts ‚Ä¶.

KEEP DANCING!!!

1g8x59e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1g8x59e/when_someone_tells_me_to_eat_or_offers_me/,When someone tells me to eat or offers me something to eat,"I don't like eating new foods or unfamiliar foods. I don't enjoy being surprised by food. This makes recovering more complicated, because I will only eat certain foods. And am bothered by textures or if the flavor is too intense. These are things they do not typically address in treatment for anorexia. I have a fear of weight gain, but that's not the only thought that goes through my mind. And fear of weight gain is not the only reason I may refuse food or the only reason I might have anxiety about eating

For example, if someone offers me an unfamiliar food that I have never had before, my first thought is ""I'm afraid to eat because it's new."" I am not just being picky, but have a fear of eating the food simply because it is unfamiliar. For this reason, I often don't enjoy going out to eat, trying a new item off a menu and have a very difficult time being spontaneous and trying a new brand. I do not think ""I am going to try this new item because it sounds good."" I instead think ""I would rather stick to eating my familiar foods that feel comfortable to me.""

In inpatient treatment, because they often didn't make adjustments for those with autism, I had to eat foods that caused sensory issues and distress, because the people treating me didn't seem to be aware of the reason why eating might have been more difficult for me. If a nurse in inpatient treatment told to me to eat what was in front of me, and I was having a hard time, she assumed I was being resistant because of the fear of weight gain.

So I have a fear of weight gain. I like to weigh a specific number. On top of the fear of weight gain, I am uncomfortable with eating around lots of people. I also dislike eating in loud or unfamiliar places. A hospital setting, for example. Sensory issues cause me to be distracted and make it difficult to enjoy the food. Sensory issues from a certain light in the dining area, or noise from being inside a coffee shop, for example. This is why the hospital setting simply didn't work for me. And this often why I prefer to eat my meals at home, often alone

If someone was there to advocate for me, and say something like ""The reason she's having a hard time eating is because she's feeling anxious because it's something she's never eaten before. Can you give her more time to complete the meal?"" or something like ""She said this food is too spicy or too sweet and it is bothering her. Can you provide her with another option that will be more comfortable for her to eat?"" This way, the people treating you know that you are not trying to avoid eating. But you need other options, because of sensory issues

It is important people separate the fear of weight gain from sensory issues and distress at the thought of eating a new food. Because they can often look very similar and if you aren't familiar with autism, you sometimes won't know why the person is uncomfortable. If they are anorexic and in treatment for it, it's easy to assume the only reason why the person isn't eating or afraid to eat is specifically because of not wanting to gain weight

I didn't want to gain weight in the hospital. But I also faced other challenges, which I wish they would have recognized. I have several issues I deal with. Eating in front of other people has never been more comfortable for me. It won't make me less introverted, to eat more in front of others. It won't cause me to suddenly be able to enjoy the meal. It only causes me more anxiety.

Some people with anorexia may have no problem eating with others and they may enjoy it. Others with anorexia may prefer to eat alone, because they feel anxious in a social setting and have sensory issues with eating. Both ways of eating are perfectly fine. And adjustments could be made for those who are more introverted

Sometimes I have a hard time advocating for myself when I am in distress. If I am upset, sometimes I don't speak up. I stay quiet, if I find a situation too overwhelming. So I do wish that someone would have been there to advocate for me in inpatient treatment.

I already have social anxiety. Eating with several other people will not help me get over this, and in fact, causes me more anxiety.

If I was served a certain type of soup in inpatient treatment, and it was too hot or the texture bothered me, and I became uncomfortable, no one took the time to understand. But sensory issues can cause distress. Once you experience a sensory sensitivity, it's hard to focus on other things, because that is how uncomfortable it makes you feel. Everyone can feel uncomfortable eating certain foods. Or have anxiety around others. Or be bothered by certain lights or sounds. But with autism, this is heightened. A sound that may not seem like a big deal to someone else can really hurt my ears. And so if you are eating in a certain setting, and several people are talking, all at once, you can find it distracting. And sensory issues aren't a choice but a response to extreme discomfort. It is often difficult for me to articulate the right words when I am uncomfortable. So I wish that inpatient centers would offer more accommodations for those with autism.

Generally, someone I am close to is aware of the foods that cause me discomfort and the foods I like. So when someone like my mom makes a meal for me, she doesn't surprise me because she knows I am uncomfortable with new foods. She knows what foods I enjoy eating

My nutritionist makes adjustments for my sensory issues. She asks me what foods I like and what foods I am uncomfortable with. There is no pressure to completely alter my eating habits. That's harder to do for a person with autism. But she is supportive if I do try a new food

I think treatment for anorexia should make more room for treatment to be tailored to fit the person's needs. Because we are all different and react to food, treatment and therapy, in different ways",2,1729535852.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,1.0,False

We currently live in Texas, my whole family is from the south, and I have visited New York one time for a brief trip a few years ago (but am planning another trip soon to do more exploring)

I have been doing tons of research, but I also feel like there‚Äôs SO MUCH, and I‚Äôm sort lost. It‚Äôs exciting but also scary. I would love to hear from other BWT about their experiences and recommendations.

About me: In my late 20s, 2 cats, not big into nightlife but enjoy walkable areas with lots of green space, fun coffee shops, etc. Recently started renting a house with a yard in a more residential area after living 4+ years downtown because we wanted some space and quiet. My husband would be working in midtown manhattan. Budget for rent would ideally be $5k or under, but would go up to $5.5-6k if we really needed to.

My questions/concerns:
- The thought of giving up a yard and moving back to a small apartment is little hard to stomach. Should we accept the long commute time and live in the suburbs? Have heard westchester area is nice? Or is it worth it to start out in the city??
- If we do live in the city, do you have any recommendations for nice, quieter, walkable areas with an easy commute to manhattan? Seems like parts of queens or Brooklyn might be best?
- If we opt to live somewhere quieter, will it be difficult for me to make friends as a youngish person without kids/too boring lol?
- Safety concerns: I‚Äôm trying to be rational about this, but everyone hears the horror stories. I‚Äôm not concerned about being murdered, but am worried about harassment or generally feeling unsafe as a woman. 
- Give it to me straight: is the subway as terrible as everyone makes it out to be?

Context:
I‚Äôm 22 and have a twin sister. We go to different colleges, but I hang out with her friends sometimes because I switched colleges this year and haven‚Äôt made any new friends yet. Past month or this month not sure haha, I met one of her friends, Sam, who I had never heard of before, at her friend‚Äôs house. Sam is super pretty, and I got a little vibe from her, but we just chatted casually and after a few chats she just talked about boys so I kinda got the hint. 

Afterward, I asked my twin about her and said something like, ‚ÄúWho is she? She‚Äôs really pretty.‚Äù My twin immediately told me, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs bisexual, and back off.‚Äù She also said she didn‚Äôt want me dating any of her friends again, which was surprising.

To give some background, my ex was also one of my twin‚Äôs friends. My sister actually set us up, but it ended badly. My ex cheated, which led to a huge fight between my ex and my twin, and my ex‚Äôs friend group cut her off. Somehow, I got blamed for this by my sister, even though I had nothing to do with the cheating or my ex reaction. I ended on good terms with my ex and after a few chats she apologized to me twin but it was too late. My twin had to make new friends again.  

The Sam Situation:
The next week, Sam said we should all go out (friend group and me) to a queer bar. I was excited about the plan. Also I followed her on Instagram, and she followed me back. A day later, she reacted to one of my older posts, and I started to overthink things, wondering if she was interested in me or just being friendly. At the end we didn‚Äôt go to the bar due to some external issues in my family. 

Family Event Drama:
But this weekend, my family threw a huge party for my grandmother‚Äôs 80th birthday with around 300 people. My sister invited all her friends, including Sam, we were all going to be in a table. Also when I was getting ready my twin teased me about ‚Äúlooking pretty for Sam‚Äù even though she had told me not to get involved with her. And she also showed me a photo go what Sam was going to wear. It was confusing because her teasing didn‚Äôt match the ‚Äústay away‚Äù message.

At the event, Sam sat next to me, and we were chatting in a super friendly way, but I had a feeling she liked me. She teased me about not drinking and was being playful, so I drank a little more and eventually got tipsy. 

Of course after being tipsy I decided to test the waters and started flirting with her, and to my surprise, she flirted back. I was really happy, and we were having a great time and chatting outside the saloon. There were more people outside, it eas obvious we where flirting and that we were into each other (from what I heard because in my tipsy head we were being lowkey).

Everything Went Wrong:
Then things took a turn. Someone told my mom that Sam and I were kissing at the event (which wasn‚Äôt true), and my mom, who knows I‚Äôm lesbian but struggles with it, freaked out. She caused a scene, and the night turned into a disaster. I got guilt-tripped, and my family started fighting with me and well saying all types of things about me and messing up. 

After all this, Sam got the hint and went off to hang out with her friends. I ended up alone, upset, and crying. I really felt terrible cause I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all because it‚Äôs a girl. Sam came over later to talk to me, but the vibe was off after everything that had happened, she was super nice and supportive but it wasn‚Äôt the same. 

The Aftermath:
Next day I got grounded for the whole situation, and Sam was embarrassed by how things played out. My twin is also angry with me, and we had a fight about the whole thing. My mom also said to my twin that Sam can never come to the house and she doesn‚Äôt want to see her again (bit homophobic and unfair) Sam and I have been messaging a little bit, but everything feels awkward and messed up now.

I want to ask Sam to grab coffee and talk things through, but I‚Äôm worried my twin will step in and tell her to stay away from me. I really like Sam, but it feels like everything it‚Äôs to complicated now and we just flirted a bit. 

Any advice?
How do I approach this? I really want to fix things with Sam and I like her but I don‚Äôt want to make things worse with my family and twin.

Summary: 

I met one of my twin sister‚Äôs friends, Sam, at a recent gathering and we hit it off. My twin warned me to back off, saying she didn‚Äôt want me dating her friends because of a messy breakup I had with one of her other friends in the past. Despite that, I kinda liked Sam but wasn‚Äôt sure if she liked me back. At a huge family event for my grandmother, I got tipsy and flirted with Sam, and she flirted back. Things were going well until someone falsely told my mom we were kissing, which caused a big family fight. Now, I‚Äôm grounded, my twin is upset, and things with Sam feel awkward. I want to ask her out for coffee to talk, but I‚Äôm worried my sister might get in the way or be more angry with me cause I already flirted with her. ",1,1729535108.0,LesbianActually,2,1.0,False
1g8wtqy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g8wtqy,"Why do baristas keep spelling my name the ""feminine"" way üôÉ","Okay, so I pass finally. As in people typically address me as ""sir"" & new people I meet are suprised to learn I'm trans. So I at least pass most of the time, but almost everytime I get coffee it is a crapshoot how they spell my name. It's eithier correct, they spell it as a feminine variation, or they straight up *ask*. It sucks so much because it's a name where they for sure wouldn't be asking a cis dude how he spells it, you know? (not giving my name, but it ends with a ""y"" sound, think ""Bobby"" vs. ""Bobbi""). I live in a very liberal, west coast city in the U.S. so I think people are probably just trying to be affirming & polite by asking or spelling it the feminine way, but doesn't make it hurt less.

Is it my face, or does it have to be my mannerisms? 1st pick is grown out facial hair, second pic is grown out but slightly lighter facial hair (it's been getting darker), and third is a closer shave.

It isn't my voice, that is solidly at a 110hz/ 115hz average & I can get down to 87hz now. But my cadence can for sure be more feminine, could that contribute? Look, I really don't mind coming off a bit fruity lol, but not to the extent it makes people question if I'm a guy. I think my facial hair affects it, too, seems to get worse when I have a closer shave. But...yeah. any ideas on why I keep getting pseudo-clocked would be appreciated üôÉ",11,1729535092.0,FtMpassing,3,0.92,False
1g8wtgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1g8wtgi/i_had_an_affair_from_my_toxic_marriage_and_fell/,I had an affair from my toxic marriage and fell so deeply in love. I messed up not leaving when I said I would after him waiting for the right time when I was financially able to support my kids. I left a few days later and he won‚Äôt give us a chance because he had already met someone new. ,"Hi, I don‚Äôt really know how to explain this without all of the judgement or the I got what I deserved, but really I‚Äôm looking for anonymous advice because I am so down. 
I have been married for 14 years, and I have two of the most amazing perfect humans I could ever be so lucky to have. They are kind and funny and loving and I am so proud of them, they are my everything and I will always put them first. They are precious teens and just the lights of my life. 
Their dad, who I met as a teenager myself, is a controlling and abusive (not physically) partner. He does not have any patience for any of my needs and expects me to be at his mercy always, I get scared of everything in the relationship as he will get very angry at me. He has financial control over me, I have to send him my wages, he will question every penny I spend and look where I went to spend it (i.e a coffee shop location) i know my youngest is very receptive to his treatment of me and when he has finished shouting and I go upstairs she will come out her room and hug me and ask me if I am okay. He is however, a wonderful dad and when he isn‚Äôt being controlling I can be happy, he has loving sides and the family time is everything. 
As the kids got older I started my own career, which other than the financial benefit it had to our household, my husband truly hated the independence it gave me. I still had to send him most of my wages, but I did have a lot more spare than before. I could write a book on the abuse and control but it is beside the point, I‚Äôd stayed for the family unit. 
While working I met a friend, let‚Äôs call him Dave, and Dave was a wonderful person. He was very funny and understanding and we became very good friends - that was all it was, until one day it wasn‚Äôt. At first the attention was nice, and then i was looking forward to speaking to him (important note, my husband is away for work a lot and is not home much of the year). We began an emotional and then physical affair. He told me he loved me and after 4.5 months he told me to leave or he was ending it. This was too soon for me to decide to break my family up and change my children‚Äôs whole lives when I didn‚Äôt know him well enough. I don‚Äôt know how but he decided to stay, maybe two months later he gave me the same ultimatum by breaking up with me and dating someone the next day. During this week, I had a miscarriage and decided that it was him I wanted to be with. He hadn‚Äôt supported me through it but, if we would have been together he would have. When we are good, he is the best most supportive partner ever, when he ends it (and I‚Äôve don‚Äôt nothing bad to him, he will be cold towards me). Anyway, I told him that I would leave and he agreed to be together, I explained that due to the financial circumstances of my marriage I needed to get my life sorted to be able to support my children because really, I still needed to protect them, what if it didn‚Äôt work out? I needed to be in a position where I could support them, feed them and afford a house. 
So I started to do that, but I needed to do it with my husband so as I had the finances to put things into place. I moved house, I got a new job etc, but I couldn‚Äôt leave at first, due to the changes in the bills. They were a lot more than I could cope with. The control I had been under I couldn‚Äôt see I was giving all my wages and was only allowed ¬£500 of it for utilities but, the new bills were ¬£900 (not including rent). I was getting into debt but was too scared to ask for more money as he would question why I needed more, it‚Äôs funny when you‚Äôre in the abuse you don‚Äôt see what the actual situation is, I just didn‚Äôt understand how I would pay for things so I told Dave that I couldn‚Äôt leave right now as I needed to sort the finances, it was then one children‚Äôs birthday and I would not split up with him then as if I stayed those three months sorting my finances I will not hurt my child for the sake of a month, and y hen a month later my other child‚Äôs birthday and I just couldn‚Äôt leave at their birthdays. So from me saying I‚Äôm leaving, to moving, sorting and birthdays it‚Äôs over an 8 month period. I was then finally ready to leave. I am financially able to leave, I talked to my parents about moving back with them and I‚Äôm ready. I have the conversation with my husband (who has been away about 5 months of this 8 month period) and our child hears. He is hysterical, physically sick, doesn‚Äôt talk to me and I have a wobble, I tell the David, who I am deeply in love with that my kid heard. He says is that‚Äôs it? But I say I just need to sort my child first before I decide anything, he says that‚Äôs it but messages he loves me the next day. We are texting for a week completely normal, loving and planning things and I‚Äôm handling my child and he then ends things. I was absolutely devastated, like he made me so happy and I grieved the loss. I realised I needed to be brave. I messaged him 4 days later and said if I actually leave this time do we have a chance. He didn‚Äôt quite tell me, yes or no, he said he isn‚Äôt having an affair anymore. 
So I did it, I left my husband. And I went to see him (this is within 2 weeks) and he had already met someone!!! He went absolutely mad I was on my way over and called me a psycho and was very cruel. It was because she was on her way over. He called me after she left and we‚Äôve spoken every day for nearly a week, he told me he still loves me, but he thinks the damage is done. I begged; I told him I loved him. I explained why it took so long and he really has heard the abuse I‚Äôve had as I‚Äôve sent recordings. But he said he can‚Äôt. I am
Hurting so much, I know this is awful to say and I know it doesn‚Äôt matter but I guess it makes me feel better, the girl, she is not very attractive, I mean she isn‚Äôt ugly, but she isn‚Äôt special. And he has been talking to her for a few weeks. And I didn‚Äôt think she would matter. He had spent nearly a week texting me, told me he loves me but told me to date someone. I went on a date which he hated but I felt sick as it was only a distraction and I don‚Äôt want to move on by rebounding. He‚Äôs been sexting me and it was like we used to be. Then today he seemed off. And I knew it is because she is coming over tonight. After he had sexted me that morning. I asked him and he said yes. I said is she sleeping over and he said I was safe, I asked if he promised and he said where had this come from. I apologised and said sorry for asking, I know he wouldn‚Äôt sext me that morning and then do that tonight and also he said he wouldn‚Äôt so I shouldn‚Äôt have asked him to promise when he‚Äôd already said no. 
I then said I love you, have a nice date and he went mad at me. 
Said I was playing games, it was a mind fuck he was DONE with me. I begged and apologised. Said I hadn‚Äôt meant any games as I‚Äôd been clear throughout the breakup that I wanted to be with him, I‚Äôd been saying i love you for a few days. There was no game. 
He then blocked me. And I just need to feel better. This is why I took so long to end things. Because I didn‚Äôt want to risk my children over someone who might not fight for us or stick around. I needed to be in a place where I was able to support them alone if that‚Äôs what happened to me. 
And I‚Äôm sure that I deserve this after having an affair. But I am now heartbroken and would really like comforting advice on how to get over someone I had such a deep connection with. I hate he is messaging someone he doesn‚Äôt love to get over me when we could make it work. Was I an asshole? What did I do wrong with that. He‚Äôd loved me that morning. I don‚Äôt know where I triggered him. He said I threatened a date but I had said earlier that I was anxious and I‚Äôd been asked on another date but I wasn‚Äôt sure cause all I wanted was him and asked him if I should go on the date or if we had a chance and he also said I‚Äôd threatened him with a date when it was the opposite, it was I don‚Äôt want this date. 
But the switch was the I love you have a nice date. Why doesn‚Äôt he hurt the way I am when we were talking about marriage three weeks ago. And he was loving up until that afternoon. How can he move on so fast? And really what did I do wrong. ",1,1729535073.0,ToxicRelationships,1,1.0,False

Maybe my brain's reacting? Most here know my history.     Why am I stuck in this numb state?  

Both in IC, we did MC, we're on a break from MC right now since August because it was too much ""shaming"" for WH. She got tough with him, ""made him feel bad"".

We go on fun dates every weekend, he plans & proposes many, especially if he sees something he thinks I'll like, nature walks every day, he sits & talks about our day while I cook dinner in the kitchen.  He composes a short love rhyme for me every workday morning he leaves under my coffee mug, he reads to me in bed, spoons me.   But in the last month he's also developed E.D. - *only* at time of 'the act' - all other times, he's fine.  I'm not making that a big deal with him, but it scares me. (sorry for the TMI!).   But he also throws tantrums - he got cut off in traffic this morning & as the guy turned, my WH actually SPIT on the guy's truck? WTH?!  Are you 12 yrs old?!  Last week he called me screaming from the veterinarian's office he'd left late, was 15 minutes late, they said they'd put him in a room but he'd have to wait, if the Vet could even still squeeze him in.  The Vet saw him a mere 5 minutes later, but why call ME?!  When WH gets home, he tells me he stole half a bag of dog treats from the exam room & a huge handful of candy out of their candy dish ""as revenge"".  WTH? Again, I'm seeing the petulant child, despite his earlier IC (17 sessions). 

WH's simmering rage/anger is still there causing resentment, passive-aggressive behavior - so is it there against me as well?!  

Who's on those walks or dates. Is it me?  Where am I?  He just chats & talks about himself, his work, his childhood, the weather.  It feels kind of like a mother walking her child every day.  When we're at a live venue or gathering, I can feel WH's excitement. He loves the young people energy/vibe. I felt so good last week after my IC session.  Then the weekend comes, we do our date time, cuddling, trying to connect and I'm left empty.  I can endure this today, yes.  Can I be happy with this the rest of my life?  What is wrong with me?  

I just don't feel like we're connecting. WH doesn't talk about his feelings unless I start, and I'm tired of feeling like ""debbie downer"" if I express feelings. And I think the MC and I are both seeing that he's incapable of more. He isn't vulnerable enough, empathic enough, to say, ""These are my fears"".   Thanks for letting me get it out.

I'm afraid of why I'm still here? Safety, for sunk cost fallacy, for a devotion that at age 60 I don't think I'd ever find again from a partner/spouse?  I still feel stunned post Dday. The confidence in us, in him, in our love, with this new version of WH I've met, isn't there.  I'm having a hard time - could use any words of wisdom?",6,1729535048.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,5,1.0,False

I learned of my mom's abuse when I was 11. I feel incredibly sorry for her, but the reality is she is a dishonest, cruel parent who refuses to seek help and get better. 

In 2018, my best friend trusted me enough to tell me details of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of her older brother. At the time, my mom was beginning to attend therapy (she quit shortly after), on SSRIs, and was generally on her best behavior. 

My friend already knew of my mom's experiences -- my mom reveled in screaming the details of her childhood at my siblings and I. She asked if I could tell my mom about her own experiences, because she wanted my mom to reach out to her. My mom never called her, but did mail her a gift card to a local coffee chain. 

I covered for my mom my entire life. All of my friends thought she was a quirky, funny if harsh mother, because I could not bear to tell them how cruel she was behind closed doors. 

I was 23 when I told my mom about my friend's experiences, something I regret to this day. I would never make the same mistake now. 

Flash forward to last month, when this friend served as MOH at my wedding. My mom has 2 brothers - one is the abuser, another she is still in contact with. 

Toward the end of the night, my drunk mother went up to the brother she is still in touch with and said ""Hi X, have you met Y's best friend? We have so much in common."" 

Let me assure you - they have nothing in common besides the CSA. 

The fact that she would casually allude to this is disgusting. It's heartbreaking. 

My philosophy has generally been: be mean to me all you want. 

But my best friend? My maid of honor? 

You would make this comment to her on my wedding day? 

I am at a loss on how to move forward. For the first time in my life, I want to punch someone in the face - my lying mother. 

I know I cannot fix her but I would appreciate advice from people who unfortunately get it.

**Story so Far:**  
*The Whales take their first steps into the dungeons of Teth-Odin and find the lights have gone out, they have their fight against a massive hunting party of entities known as the Dead Eaters.*

**\_\_\_**

‚Äú*All clear.‚Äù* Gwen told the party, *‚Äúnothing else up ahead or behind besides some scavengers.*‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone huddle up!‚Äù Ingrid said. ‚ÄúViel will now use her Telekinesis to pile up the dead!‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me shoot some!‚Äù Selphie said excitedly ‚ÄúI can use them as whipcrawlers to replenish my gun‚Ä¶ the still-living Dead Eaters of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure!‚Äù Ingrid said, waving her arms to herd everyone around Neith. ‚ÄúCuddly, you can brighten up the butterflies now.‚Äù

‚ÄúErmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù the cute Fae Hare replied. Waving his wand around, the butterflies‚Äô luminescence intensified, now giving them twice the brilliance of a candle. Despite each butterfly‚Äôs wings sporting different colors, the light they gave off was a neutral white for easy visibility. As they brightened up, the butterflies soared higher, giving everyone a better view of the dungeon corridor around them. Philia crouched down and petted the fluffy hare, causing him to make cute murmuring sounds.

‚ÄúCuddly, have the Duck Man hold fire, don‚Äôt shoot anything or they‚Äôll learn it‚Äôs just an illusion.‚Äù Ingrid said, referring to the decoy in the shape of a moorland hunter that Cuddly was familiar with back in his homeland. The bunny ermm‚Äôd in response.

Meanwhile, the firebirds hovering several feet ahead and behind the party continued to lazily fly in circles, as they continued to do so, they occasionally revealed a hint or two of a scavenger lurking just out of its light‚Äôs range. Philia noticed Ingrid looking at them and said,

‚ÄúEasy, just think of them as stray dogs, Ingrid. It‚Äôll be fine to let them take those at the periphery.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you say so.‚Äù Ingrid replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just surprised they got here so fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt exactly fighting quietly.‚Äù Sammy told her. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd of course head towards the sound of battle and just wait for the victors to move on.‚Äù

‚Äú*Ingrid, don‚Äôt try petting them, alright?*‚Äù Zefir quipped. ‚Äú*They‚Äôre gonna eat into our profits.*‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger.‚Äù Ingrid replied ‚Äúbut if I see any mice, that‚Äôs an exception.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you planning this time?‚Äù Kinu laughed, ‚ÄúYou trying to build an army?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was thinking more of a squad of pure pellet gun madness.‚Äù Ingrid told her. ‚ÄúDrum mags holding pellets in the five digits, pure suppressing fire.‚Äù

The mice looked up at Ingrid and squeaked excitedly. She crouched down and patted their heads. ‚ÄúYup, squeak if you see any mice.‚Äù The mice responded by grabbing her hand so they could rub their heads on it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll start replenishing everyone‚Äôs shields.‚Äù Iohann remarked, kneeling as she made a prayer of protection. She began to give off a warm glow around herself and everyone started feeling more protected as her prayer mended their shielding.

‚Äú189, reload one at a time, sound off!‚Äù Philia ordered as Selphie spotted and shot her first surviving Dead Eater. The half-dead warrior growled in defiance as the parasitic plant turned him into a shambling zombie, sprouting vines and blossoms as he staggered towards her, dropping dead as the plant drained his lifeforce as well as its own to generate multiple burls into be used as wood pellets and the flowers to generate more seeds. These she would collect so she could later put her magic into the seeds, letting them burrow into the wood burls for later use.

At Philia‚Äôs order, Arthur squeaked first, quickly laying down his backpack Traveler‚Äôs Valise and taking out a spare drum mag. With quick, dexterous paws, Arthur swapped drum magazines, placing the used one inside the enchanted bag before zipping it up and putting it back on. Sully followed next, and quickly the mice one by one reloaded their magazines while the rest kept watch.

‚ÄúIroquois, do the same now.‚Äù Cecil said, ‚ÄúSound off.‚Äù

‚ÄúErmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Cuddly murmured as he took a carrot from his backpack and started eating. As a Fae Marsh Hare, he had the ability to draw from his body and convert it to mana, a fact that after Siria explained it to Ingrid she quickly took him shopping for food he could quickly consume with little to no preparation. Ingrid patted the adorable bunny‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúSo adorable.‚Äù Ingrid giggled. Cuddly pressed his head against her head, ermm‚Äôing cutely as he did so. She then went to each mouse to pat them on the head while she waited for the Item Boxing to finish, prompting each mouse to briefly let out a squeak of joy.

Meanwhile, Johnny, the monster pumpkin wiggled over to one of the slain Dead Eaters, plucking it off of the floor and then bisecting itself in the middle to reveal a mouth full of sharp chomping teeth. The sight should‚Äôve struck Ingrid as grisly but it instead cracked her up.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù Philia said, noticing Ingrid was looking at Johnny.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶‚Äù Ingrid said, starting to have a giggling fit as she patted the wiggly pumpkin. ‚ÄúLike, imagine growing some mountain duskberries and then one day they just start pulling themselves out of the ground and start walking to the nearest mountain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPffft!‚Äù Philia laughed ‚ÄúGrowing them is going to be an exercise in futility‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we have Johnny Prime, as you call him.‚Äù Selphie said, sweeping the burls and seeds from a broom taken off of Neith‚Äôs porter rig. Johnny Prime or JP was the original Duskberry that Selphie ‚Äútamed‚Äù and planted in Ram Ranch, unlike wild duskberries he was content to stay rooted near the house, near the gazebo where the Larkirk pigeons roosted.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Ingrid giggled ‚ÄúBut the thought of growing crops that run away is just funny.‚Äù

As the girls giggled, one Dead Eater managed to get up, but as he tried to hobble away he was suddenly snatched up into the air by Yogzolom, Iohann‚Äôs Nyx Fish familiar. Resembling a siamese fighting fish twice the size of an arapaima, the Dead Eater was crunched up in its massive jaws easily.

Meanwhile, Philia summoned her shotgun again and started reloading the bullets, at 200 bullets per type for a maximum of three types and 600 bullets total, she sighed as she began the long arduous process.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you got a machine for that, Philia?‚Äù Ingrid asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the works.‚Äù Philia said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been rather busy working on everyone else‚Äôs gear first. I plan to modify this gun like the Remington M-series which uses magazines.‚Äù

‚Äú*I‚Äôm seeing more scavengers piling up, we‚Äôre drawing quite a crowd.*‚Äù Zefir advised them, the drones Aquila and Falcis silently hovered high above the ceiling, and from the combined night vision and infrared, he and Gwen were able to see various scavengers slowly inching their way.

‚ÄúKeep reloading, Philia. We‚Äôll take care of this.‚Äù Kinu said. Kvaris let out a loud series of barks as the two sisters stepped ahead, showing themselves and making it clear to the scavengers that they were aware of their presence.

Johnny must have noticed them too, for before Zefir spoke up, the wiggly pumpkin shambled a good five feet away from the group and began laying out roots on the ground, along the lengths of which sprouted bright juicy fruits ready to burst with a nasty surprise. Some of Cuddly‚Äôs butterflies rested on these fruits, illuminating them but the scavengers here were no fools and knew there was something very wrong in trying to eat up something offered by a walking plant.

Cecil and the mice brightened up their lamps, causing a small stampede as the scavengers tried to scuttle further away from the light. The mice let out loud angry squeaks that sounded like territorial calls which no other creature dared to try vocalize against, lest they provoke a fight.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot yet.‚Äù Siria said ‚ÄúWe need those scavengers. Those that get too close deserve at least a warning shot. Ignore the slimes though, they‚Äôre fine.‚Äù

The mice squeaked in assent.

‚ÄúAt least the slimes have balls.‚Äù Ingrid remarked as some of them started gently rappelling down from the ceiling. ‚ÄúCecil, wanna shake hands again? Maybe this time one of them‚Äôs carrying interesting abilities‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would be convenient‚Ä¶‚Äù Cecil said ‚Äú...if they do absorb abilities then this dungeon would‚Äôve been regulated by slimes long ago!‚Äù

Kinu, Kvaris, and Sammy had been checking each other for any injuries or damaged armor, all of them smiling in satisfaction as they found that none of them had sustained any damage at all, neither to their armor nor themselves. At the mention of slimes merging with each other, their ears perked up.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fallacy to that claim, Cecil.‚Äù Kinu spoke up, patting a slime. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never met any slimes that talk much less have your intelligence, it could be a possibility.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Kvaris chimed in ‚Äúfor all we know one of those slimes can cast infinite fireballs.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd for all we know‚Ä¶‚Äù Sammy added ‚Äúyou might be this world‚Äôs equivalent of an Elder Slime, who‚Äôs to say your arcane dimension isn‚Äôt in fact your own magic?‚Äù

‚ÄúHahaha, funny, I‚Äôm no such thing.‚Äù Cecil said, but he did fly over his Dialog Window over to one slime that started engulfing one of the Dead Eaters. Tentatively he stretched a tendril out.

‚ÄúIngrid, what I did last time was really stupid, so cut it off the minute something bad happens.‚Äù Cecil said. Ingrid didn‚Äôt answer but he did feel her mana signature flare a bit as she watched the procedure.

‚ÄúHeeeey, buddy!‚Äù Cecil said ‚ÄúWanna uuh‚Ä¶ exchange cards?‚Äù

The slime let out a tendril, as if sniffing out Cecil, then it hesitated. It wriggled as it split itself in two then the graft excitedly crawled over and gently wrapped itself around Cecil‚Äôs tendril.

‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù Cecil cried out. ‚ÄúFeels like strong morning coffee after waking up!‚Äù he paused, shaking himself, ‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶a lot more energetic! Though I don‚Äôt think I can cast spells anytime soon‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure something out.‚Äù Ingrid told him. Looking up, she saw that Viel had already finished piling up all of the dead into a neat stack.

‚ÄúDispatching time!‚Äù she called to everyone ‚ÄúNobody goes alone! Iroquois, spread out more and cover us while we dispatch. Selphie, shoot a few more of the ones farthest, that way they can help while replenishing your ammo.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it, Ingrid!‚Äù The dryad chirped, firing three more shots on both sides. As predicted the vines whipped out or stabbed the dying Dead Eaters as the now-crawling parasitized ones got into range.

Cecil cried out again. ‚ÄúThe portals, Ingrid! Look!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Cec-oh!‚Äù Ingrid then noticed that Kiowa‚Äôs sub-portals were now capable of moving much farther. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that? Forty feet now?‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks like the case!‚Äù Cecil said ‚ÄúAlright guys! Don‚Äôt stray too far now! Bring it back.‚Äù The Kiowa team squeaked in response and took up positions again, now capable of spreading out more.

As the Iroquois team was testing the portal ranges the rest of the team got to work dispatching the survivors. There were quite a few of them still lying around though few were actually still capable of moving, most were unconscious and bleeding out.

‚ÄúUse your polearms everyone, or whatever‚Äôs got good range!‚Äù Ingrid told them, dispatching her targets with a quick elongated blur of a kick to the head, followed by a quick elongated blur of her arm so she now held them by the neck before tossing them to the pile. Kinu and Kvaris used their corsecas while Sammy her halberd. Philia used a combination of her gun‚Äôs bayonets and her Guardians; constructs generated by her Praetorian Armlets to dispatch the fallen with their swords. Siria also joined in, her staff generating and energy blade at the end and the mice of The 189 used their glaives. All the while, Yogzolom and Johnny helped themselves by biting off the heads before throwing the rest of the body into the pile.

The affair took only a few minutes, there was a moment of tension as the party went closer to the scavengers, but Iroquois‚Äô bright spotlights kept them away. Fortunately, not even a warning shot was needed. Also, as one turned her back to the scavengers, she was covered by a teammate, with Ingrid being the sole exception, handling the northern end all by herself.

‚Äú*Don‚Äôt feed them Ingrid*!‚Äù Zefir reminded her.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt feed those that can‚Äôt handle a gun.‚Äù She chuckled in a sing-song voice.

‚ÄúAs Philia and Siria said, don‚Äôt take all of them.‚Äù Viel called to Ingrid, her cute voice echoing in the corridor ‚ÄúThe scavengers are an important part of this dungeon, and they do need to know that we adventurers aren‚Äôt enemies‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôre not their caretakers either.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know...‚Äù Ingrid said.

‚ÄúAnd let the slimes take what they will‚Ä¶ for now.‚Äù Siria said. ‚ÄúJust nudge them if they try to take those fallen dungeoneers.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù

A few minutes later, Ingrid joined the southern team, which lessened the tension as the scavengers scrambled further back. As everyone huddled back over to Neith, Ingrid, Sammy, and Iohann go to work cutting the fallen adventurers‚Äô free of their bindings before wrapping them up in a sheet. These were among the stuff they had bought for occasions like these such as encountering fallen adventurers or‚Ä¶ *God forbid one of our own*, Ingrid thought, came to pass.

‚ÄúWe can take from the fallen so long as they don‚Äôt look like heirlooms and are pertinent to adventuring, everything else we leave alone.‚Äù Siria told her. ‚ÄúViel? Ready?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup!‚Äù The ciltran chirped and the two of them began casting their Item Box spells. For purposes of efficiency and redundancy, the party had agreed that the two of them will use Item Boxing so ease the load.

‚ÄúStay on guard everyone!‚Äù Ingrid said, following Iohann and Sammy‚Äôs example of dipping her hands into one of the slimes to clean them. She didn‚Äôt need to as she could simply use her mana to nuke any germs off of her hands but she couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity to pat a friendly, jiggly slime. She suppressed a snicker as she watched Philia resume reloading her shotgun one shell at a time.

¬†

‚Äú*Part of me really wishes I could tag along‚Ä¶*‚Äù Zefir said, ‚Äú*But I guess this boredom‚Äôs for the best.*‚Äù

‚ÄúWar is one of two things, Baseplate. Either it‚Äôs very boring or it‚Äôs very scary.‚Äù Philia told him. ‚ÄúBesides, you‚Äôre in your own set of danger right now. We still have problems with a certain gang of thieves, how‚Äôs it going over there?‚Äù

‚Äú*So far all‚Äôs been quiet.*‚Äù Zefir replied. ‚Äú*Medusa and Euryale have been busy sparring with each other and the Larkirks have been happily cooing about.*‚Äù he told her, referring to the pair of Wolian bodyguards and messenger pigeons they purchased some days ago back in New Gorpisal.

‚ÄúWhat news from Dallas and Wayne?‚Äù Ingrid inquired. ‚ÄúI got a bad feeling some unscrupulous rich asshole is going to barge in and demand some kind of ridiculous extortion fee from them or try to take their goods.‚Äù

‚Äú*They‚Äôve checked in every hour.*‚Äù Gwen replied. ‚Äú*I‚Äôm handling the comms between the canned goods store and Loch Ness, Dallas and Wayne say they‚Äôre doing fine and are turning in good money. No one has come by to harass them, fortunately.*‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs some good news.‚Äù Ingrid said. ‚ÄúWhat about Loch Ness?‚Äù she added, referring to their town Ram Ram by its call-sign.

‚Äú*Sabrina‚Äôs laboratory is still being built.*‚Äù Gwen replied. ‚Äú*She says she loves the wooden cottage Starfox built for her but can‚Äôt afford to do anything but the most basic potion making in a house like that. Says she needs sturdy stone walls and a good distance away from the town, preferably over gravelly ground just like her old cottage.*‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Ingrid thought for a moment. Cataline had a point, she really needs a sturdy stone house for her laboratory work and a good place to have it built. ‚ÄúHopefully we can have that arranged. Tell her to sit tight and focus on herb gathering for the moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can buy a good amount of bricks and tile for Sabrina‚Äôs laboratory from those Dead Eaters and still have plenty to spare.‚Äù Kvaris said. ‚ÄúGlados, can you remind us later?‚Äù

‚ÄúAffirmative.‚Äù Neith replied.

‚ÄúWhat else?‚Äù Ingrid asked.

‚Äú*Starfox is considering having a boat built but he needs a professional boat builder for something like that. Some of our fishermen have tried diving into the lake and found it very deep some one hundred feet out‚Ä¶ it just falls out to a vast abyss. Said fishermen didn‚Äôt want to peer in however, saying that the undercurrent was getting stronger.*‚Äù

‚Äú*Just hearing that gives me serious thalassophobia.*‚Äù Zefir remarked. ‚Äú*Fear of deep, dark water, in case anyone‚Äôs wondering.*‚Äù

‚ÄúNot if there‚Äôs some good mer-folk down there.‚Äù Kvaris told him. ‚ÄúWe could establish good trade‚Ä¶ IF there are, I doubt it in that arcane dimension however‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Item Box spells of Viel and Siria closed up, and Ingrid signalled for the party to move, leaving behind a small pile of Dead Eaters for the scavengers to feast on.

\_\_\_

The location of the redoubt was on the right hand tunnel, opposite from where the initial Dead Eater hunting party came from, two intersections down, then a right turn into the escape tunnels. There were no other combat encounters except for a small procession of large turtle-like scavengers the size of an SUV one intersection down. Despite being turtles they moved with the grace of a big cat and barely gave the party a glance.

‚Äú*Again, Don‚Äôt think of petting them, Ingrid.*‚Äù Zefir said suddenly. ‚Äú*Just one of those big boys are gonna get 90% of all our loot.*‚Äù

The Whales let out quiet chuckles at Zefir‚Äôs remark.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Ingrid jokingly shot back ‚ÄúI was only thinking of putting a machinegun atop them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ‚Äòtank‚Äô discussion again?‚Äù Sammy snickered ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll do us no good in a place like this...‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Ingrid said quickly. ‚ÄúBut for the open field it may help.‚Äù

The giant turtles moved quickly enough that the party didn‚Äôt need to slow down their pace, they didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the firebird that hovered above and lit up the intersection.

The party continued on, with the firebirds lighting the path ahead and behind them, the swarm of fae butterflies illuminating the party, and the observer drones hovering out of sight, hiding in the darkness to keep an eye out. As usual, Johnny‚Äôs roots trailed behind the party, deploying and redeploying volatile biological landmines to deter any back attacks.

‚ÄúSwitch up after we leave the redoubt.‚Äù Ingrid said. ‚ÄúKinu and Aviz you‚Äôll take point with me this.‚Äù

‚ÄúGotcha.‚Äù Kinu replied, she and Sammy were taking turns walking backwards to ensure they were being followed. Charles and Oscar were also doing the same, squeaking to each other as they assumed shifts.

¬†

Reaching the escape tunnels, Viel shrunk down the birds to account for the smaller quarters and Ingrid this time took up the front.

‚ÄúShooters, eyes up on the ceilings.‚Äù Ingrid said,

‚ÄúOn it.‚Äù Cecil replied, keeping his spotlights aimed high, but fortunately he found nothing.

A few minutes of walking, Ingrid came across a circular opening, inlaid with carvings and a solid stone door. Remembering what was taught to her in the orientation, she touched the stone door and channeled a bit of her mana. Unlike the portal, it required an injection of energy to open and another to close it. Ingrid poke a mana-infused finger and the door made a scraping stone-on-stone sound as it slid to the side.

The party squinted their eyes as light flooded the corridor, it seemed that the faerie lights of this chamber was insulated from the influence of the mana surge that occurred during the night of the full moon. A cool breeze blew in, stronger than the ones that wafted across the corridors.

Ingrid peered into the circular room around them, it was quite spacious inside, easily holding a hundred people or more. She stepped aside and quickly ushered everyone in, making sure she was the last to enter the room before poking the round door frame with her mana to securely close it shut.

Turning around, Ingrid nodded at the four golden mice clones, who stood guard with their glaives out, she crouched down to pet them, making cute noises as she did. She did the same for the wriggling pumpkin that was Johnny, who started laying down roots in front of the door.

I spent so much time on Reddit and other websites just doom spiraling and hopefully my account can mitigate some concern. 

  
Firstly, I'm in my 40s and had very crowded teeth. One of those who went years without going to the dentist etc. Finally got some good decent insurance so went, got my wisdom teeth out, got a bunch of fillings for cavities and started Invisalign with 10 day changes. 

Caveat - I know everyone's pain tolerance and lifestyle is different so absolutely not trying to represent that my experience is typical for everyone.

  
- The 20-22 hours thing at first seems pretty horrifying but once you start timing things out and getting into a routine it really becomes so much easier than you think. About the main thing is to be somewhat thoughtful about combining eating and drinking or like put on your coffee and cook your food before you take them out. Any decent time management should allow you to hit 21-22 hours fairly easily. 

- I've been lucky to have very little pain. Maybe some teeth sensitivity the first day or two but nothing that I would call major. Of course everyone's pain tolerance is different but I've never even had to take  a Tylenol. About the big thing I've noticed is that my teeth will be a little more sensitive to cold water and stuff the first day or so but that goes away. 

- I have had the issue of some trays being bouncy on the back molar and, as this Reddit will teach you, just bend the area towards your back tooth and it will rectify the issue. 

- Floss picks, an ortho key and a Waterpik will make your life so much less stressful, especially early on. I floss and use the Waterpik every time I take them out and at minimum it assuages my anxiety.  I also soak the IV in cleaner every time I take them out. The orthokey will help eliminate the horror of feeling like these things are stuck on you. Remember, your teeth won't fall out when you take them off.

- I went two months without drinking anything other than water but have come off recently and so far, fine. I'll drink light beer with them in and, once again so far, zero issues with staining or teeth damage. Just be diligent about washing and soaking them when home. It's so easy to be paranoid and, quite frankly, there's so much contradictory advice from dentists and online. Most people you meet in real life you have had Invisalign will tell you just be smart about rinsing out with water and avoid dark liquids and you'll be fine. 

  
So, that's really my thoughts three months in. Glad I started it though it's a lengthy process. Good luck to everyone feeling any anxiety. You got this. ",2,1729534505.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False

Wala nanga akong standards actually basta magka-vibe pero now I‚Äôm starting to have a standard na kahit basic thing na don‚Äôt date if you‚Äôre broke. Mag-aaya ka sa date tapos papa-shoulder mo lahat sakin, to think na they are people with work tapos ako student lang. Kaso ang hirap magkaron ng standards, kahit alam kong I can offer well even sa looks, is it bad if I find someone attractive din? I‚Äôm afraid baka sabihin ng iba na wala naman akong ma-ooffer tulad ng mga posts dito sa reddit. I really know my worth, I‚Äôve been building this up to myself tapos sisirain lang ng random broke guy who can‚Äôt even take care of himself yung self-worth ko. Even my friends are mad na they take me out sa good places to eat tapos yung mga dine-date ko idadala lang daw ako sa mcdo or random coffee shops na tag 60 pesos yung drink tapos hindi man lang daw ako malibre. Pano ba kasi i-filter yung mga tao na maaayos, parang nagiging cycle na sya for me and I‚Äôm fully aware of that. I know I deserve better pero I‚Äôm really accountable of my choices. Ang hirap pano mag-start ulit.",1,1729534498.0,OffMyChestPH,5,0.6,False
1g8wk4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1g8wk4k/trivial_but_i_need_help_with_the_phin_filter/,Trivial but I need help with the Phin filter ,"My doubts: 

1. The press inside the filter doesn't go to the level of the coffee powder. I'm adding about two full table spoons of ground coffee. Should I add more coffee powder? Or is there some problem with my filter. 

2. It drips really fast. It takes not more than a min. Again, what could be the problem? 

3. The coffee doesn't taste as good as it was back in Vietnam. I am using the filter and coffee grounds from vietnam only. May be, the magic of the place. 

Thank you in advance! ",1,1729534437.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

I am an aspiring Data Engineer based in the UK - working to transition into the field as a POC with no prior experience in the technology field, or degree in any subject.

**Context/Qualifications:**

I have committed the last 7 months to self-directed learning (through UDEMY courses, YouTube, freeCodeCamp etc.) learning Python, SQL and the principles of data orchestration, architecture and data pipelines. 

* A background in Business and Marketing (freelanced as a brand manager/strategist), as well as IT (A-Levels) - I have always had a passion for business and the data that informs decisions. 
* Certificate of Higher Education, in Business and Management from a Russel Group university.
* I grasp new concepts very quickly: mostly by doing, and am interested in machine learning.

  
**Steps I have taken so-far:**

* Sending out LinkedIn connection requests, with personalised messages, to existing DEs - both junior and a few years into their career. Goal: suggesting a virtual/in-person coffee chat to discuss their 
* Sending out emails to existing DEs
* Putting skills into practice, through coding exercises etc.
* Looking into Data Apprenticeships/Traineeships 

  
*My main questions are:*

* What is a realistic time frame to transition into the field, considering my background?
* How can I practically prepare for being job-ready, and what is a realistic timeframe?
* Is data engineering a guaranteed career path for the next few years? I understand data engineers are extremely valuable in facilitating the creation and management of reliable, consistent and quality data - which businesses need. However, I spoke with a recruiter recently, who shared companies were more concerned with AI facing roles now).

I am open to all advice, and really appreciate your feedback, in advance!

Thanks a bunch!!
