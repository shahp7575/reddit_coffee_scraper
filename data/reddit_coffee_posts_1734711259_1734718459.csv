The moment it dried down on my skin, I knew that it was the perfect scent that people can associate with me (I've been told that it suits me). The con about it is that it's not really that good with the heat during the daytime + it's kind of pricey to be an everyday perfume.

I'm not into the scent of vanilla, but the YSL LIBRE INTENSE was an exception.

There were nurses, respiratory techs, safety patrol, pharmacy, administrators‚Ä¶. Now mind you, im there at 9am after working yet another night shift, and everyone said they couldn‚Äôt meet at 7:30am so i could just come right in after my shift rather than sit around for 2 hours waiting for the meeting to start. 

The meeting starts.  I‚Äôm tired as F and drinking way more coffee than i should.  Every topic that is brought up, i have to answer and say why it is possible or not, why it meets Standard of care or not and i have to review these near misses and safety issues and asked how we can avoid it in the future.   

After an hour, i was hit with a dose of reality‚Ä¶ i am the only asshole in this room that isn‚Äôt being paid to be here and no one cares about my health, my wellbeing, or my time line yet they need me in this meeting.  I actually became quite upset.  I probably shouldn‚Äôt have done this and it was probably the fatigue - but at the end of the meeting they wanted to schedule another meeting for next week again adter my next night shift.   So i said NO, absolutely not.  They picked another day, and i said NO.  They picked a day i have off and i said NO.   Then they asked my what day and time would work for me as i believe they finally understood what was going on‚Ä¶ i said Sunday at 10 am.    The room went quiet.   The admin was first to respond - well, we don‚Äôt work on Sundays, so that isn‚Äôt going to work for most of us in this room.   So i snapped back with - ‚ÄúYou mean that I am the only person in this room, not being paid to be here and i have to bend over backwards to accommodate everyone i n this room at the expense of my own healthcare wellbeing, and you all don‚Äôt want to meet on Sunday becuse yoy don‚Äôt get paid to be here Sunday at 10 am, only 9-5 Monday through Fridays‚Ä¶ from now on my only free day to have this meeting is Sunday.‚Äù   I then said thank you and walked out of the room.

My intent was to stop being involved in hospital committees for free‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm tired of being taken advantage of.   They need us on these committees yet we are the only people not being paid to be there., my time is worth something and my free time is worth even more!    I asked the nurses in the room later on - if we had the meeting on Sunday what would happen?  They said ‚Äúwell we would get paid time and a half to come in on an off day‚Äù.

1hipshr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1hipshr/two_stories_back_to_back_2019/,Two stories back to back 2019,"Alright so these are two stories from years ago working in a restaurant.

I used to work in this place just before coronavirus hit. The boss was a grumpy old man who was yelling at everybody including customers and workers because in his mind he was the only one who knew how to run the place and no one else knew shit about what they were doing. He even forced me to get up almost every morning at 5 am and fix air conditioners and fridges for local bars/hotels/bakeries and restaurants but that is a story for another day.

One hot summer day it was very slow and we had almost nobody since we opened at 2 pm. If I remember correctly there was this one woman in her early 40s who came at about 3 for lunch and she would come almost every day there and we used to talk and flirt a little bit. Since I was only 20 years old at the time I found this woman to be very charming and incredibly flirty with me to the point where I wanted to ask her out after work but I was too shy at the time to do so. Anyway this woman pays for her drinks and food and leaves. I am embarrassed to say all her flirting left me with an erection and it is very awkward to have this happen at work so I was trying to hide it and pretend like it does not exist. Two hours go by, I was sitting in front waiting for customers to arrive scrolling through my phone. Out of nowhere I look up and there is this big group of 8 women coming. I greet them and sit them down, I gave them the menus and waited for them to order. They order their drinks and food and I go tell the order to the chefs. 30 minutes go by and the food is ready I am just about to take it out to their table. Mind you I still have an erection, I take the food bring it to them plate by plate. While carrying the last two orders I go to the table and while putting the plates down this woman that was sitting in the middle mid talking to them waves her hand around and puts her left arm right on my crotch. She starts laughing, I chuckle a bit but managed to keep it cool and be professional. I turn around to go get the other orders that were coming in and I can hear her say ""I just grabbed his crotch omg"" and starts chuckling. My face goes red in embarrassment but I had to work so I brush it off and keep going, I have to say this is one of my funniest/downright embarrassing stories as a waiter.

The second story is a bit gross so beware. It was a disgustingly hot day and it was also slow just like in the first story early in the afternoon. I think I had one couple at the time having lunch and some white wine. There comes this couple, visibly looking very upset. They come up to me and ask me if they can use the bathroom and I let her go in. This woman was quite overweight and was red in the face, by her expression I knew something was wrong but I cannot bail out now since I let her in the toilet. What worried me the most was her husbands worrisome face. Anyway I was making coffee for myself and the chef and she comes out while her husband goes straight in. She comes up to me and asks for a glass of water, I give it to her and her husband eventually comes out. Her husband pulls me aside with her and tells me she has digestive issues (this is the gross part get ready). He told me she had diarrhea and before she could sit down it splashed all over the wall and seat so he went in and cleaned it up with toilet paper. The woman starts sobbing and apologizing over and over. I say its alright and it could happen to anybody so I was glad to help because she needed to use the bathroom. They thank me and we say goodbye to each other. I felt really bad for her and her poor husband, they must have been so embarrassed it ruined they vacation. I hope the woman is alright and doing better now, I felt so fucking bad for them mad. My boss and chef were there and asked me what happened so they asked me what happened and I told them. So they start making fun of me and the chef said I would not want to be in your skin right now. So I had to go in there with cleaning agents and clean it all up (where I am from waiters clean the bathroom).

Anyway those were one of my craziest stories from being a server, I have a ton of these so I might tell them in the future.",1,1734718018.0,Serverlife,0,1.0,False

Thanks to every single one of you sweet, sweet snobs on here I'm now looking to upgrade my machine. My first and current machine, an ECM Casa V, has served me pretty well over the last 2 years but I know it's still a lower end machine and I can get a lot more out of my drinks. I mostly make cappuccinos and lattes. I've got my eye on 2 machines in particular but would love some legit input from people wo either have direct experience with them or have general advice about the machines. I'm in the States and this will go on my coffee bar in my dining room so I have plenty of room for the machine.

Budget

\[$4,000\]

1. La Spaziale Luca A53. I like the looks and the more simplistic approach with a simple push of a button. My wife also likes the idea of this one and would allow her to actually try making her own drinks without being overwhelmed with its more user friendly design.

2. La  Marzocco linea Micra. Well, Its a La Marzocco so theres that lol. I know with this machine, shot after shot will be consistent and spot on. I like its simplistic look but also love the integrated app for playing around with settings at the same time. 

Have at it guys. Let me know your input and if I'm overlooking something obvious or anything.

1hippt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetCoaster2/comments/1hippt4/pc2_needs_some_serious_changes/,PC2 needs some serious changes,"When I was growing up I used to play thrillville and Sims theme park and that was back when the original PlayStation and the PS2 and even the 360 were the pioneers of gaming consoles, among other ones. Planet coaster came out in 2016 and my brother bought it for me a year later for my Xbox and I played the hell out of it. I never got into career mode. I never did franchise mode. I always went into sandbox mode and I got one theme park over the 7 to 8 years just about retrofitted before I lost interest. The reason? My vendors kept quitting. My employees kept getting tired of having too many job tasks. I lost track of how many different areas at the park I had and finally I fell out of love with the original planet coaster. Planet coaster 2 came out in November and I waited a couple weeks and read reviews. I was definitely intrigued with water slides and pools and flumes and now I've lost interest I think.  It seemed to be rating better than the newest roller coaster tycoon so I bought it and now I wish I hadn't. It's not so much fun trying to create your own flume in your own pool when you still have to have it adhere to safety standards. I really wish frontier gave us a way to toggle the settings off so we can build to our heart's content. I thought that's what the sandbox mode was for. Otherwise don't offer a sandbox mode if you're still going to have restrictions. And can I say how hellish it is to build a damn roller coaster station? I absolutely hate spending hours building a roller coaster station and I wish for a flat roof where I can toggle however many roof pieces I want to fit in an area and click it and it would be done just like that. Not to mention trying to figure out a layout for the park and not really having any ideas to go off of because theming is lacking severely. There's a resort theme. There's a Viking theme and there's a mythology theme as well as the original planet coaster and that packed that frontier just released. It's not even worth it. You got a new dark ride, a couple new roller coasters and some tweaks to flumes so that guests seem to be more believable. I'm not spending 10 bucks to get a small game pack. I wish they would give us all of the attractions we had from the original planet coaster and transfer it into our account. Maybe it would mean not getting our original parks and stuff but get our original attraction back that we can rebuild while we wait for new content to be released. I find it BS that there's no real scenario or training video on how to properly build a station. I find it very tiring spending hours on end trying to adjust my station only to quit go to a different game and get back into my session and find out that now my roof tiles or my wall tiles do not line up. It's like I'm expected to do it all in one shedding and I lose track of what I'm doing when I see other issues that I missed before. There's always a damn gap somewhere in my roof or in my path and I have to go back and correct it. Not to mention, I wish I could have a bench and a trash can opposite each other every several hundred ft or so. Instead you have to toggle back and forth between the two. And I find it immensely frustrating to attach paths to your park and to your ride because it keeps acting like I want to build underground and I don't. I'm sorry frontier, but I really hope you guys eventually give us all of our original planet coaster content because I've been playing literally since day one. I'm honestly about to go to parkitech and see if I like that better. And I really do enjoy the graphics that's for planet coaster 2. But honestly it's like planet coaster one just tweaked a little bit more with some new rides I haven't seen yet. If the new roller coaster tycoon rated better, I would definitely give that a spin but I'm not even interested. I really hope you consider the fact that by making us have to rebuy all of our packs again that you're making us spend more money than we want to spend. I shouldn't have to spend more money to get another version of a roller coaster I already have. You already have three scramblers and teacup rides that are virtually identical. They are just themed for different parts of the pack that you have to offer in the base game. Please do better and give us more options because if you keep this up I'm pretty sure a lot of people are not going to want to support planet coaster too. And please make it easier for us to toggle on and off power and water as I'm finding it exhausting as well. Trying to add these elements to my rides and the fact that guests tell me that they can't get on rides when I have the park closed is really annoying. The fact that they tell me it's too extreme when I have nobody in the park and the park is closed because I'm building it and I'm in building mode is really irritating. Please fix certain things. Have better coverage for vendors-- automatically have two people in place of the original vendor, like for a coffee shop or a gift shop and when that person goes on break one of those two people randomly fills in for their break. But honestly have two people working in a vendor shop. I don't care. Oh and we also can't access franchise mode because we have to be signed into frontier and I am not going to do that. So I hope you guys fix it because I've been at avid player since 2017 and I'd hate to lose hope on what really could make planet coaster 2 stand out above all the rest. Even with planet coaster 2 you could have already given us a holiday and Christmas pack and New Year's pack by December or end of last month and given it to us for free with some new roller coasters some new attractions and fix some of the issues that are ruining the game. I'm starting to lose hope on what really could make planet coaster 2 stand out above all the rest. Thank you. ",0,1734717825.0,PlanetCoaster2,2,0.25,False

1hipnhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hipnhh/falling_for_my_new_friend/,Falling For My New Friend,"I 28(m) met my friend 24(f) about a month ago, I was working late at my bar and they just popped into my life. There was an instant connection that was unmistakable, they have an energy that‚Äôs so fun and pure and exudes excitement. After that first meeting, my friend, who i‚Äôll call Zoe to make things easier, kept coming back to my job damn near every night I worked. They would text me to ask when i was in, and we started to make plans outside of work. I was very stoked to have a new friend, and at first I wasn‚Äôt interested in anything more, but one night when I was working behind the bar, Zoe looks at me when no one else was around and basically said they wanted to hook up with me. That changed a little something in my brain, because then i saw them in a new light, both physically and romantically. Nothing happened that night except for some texting, and afterwards Zoe said something along the lines of maybe we shouldn‚Äôt do it. I was a tad disappointed, but i wanted to respect their boundaries. Fast forward a week later, Zoe is at my house super late, they came over around 11:30pm (we are both service industry workers) to watch some movies. We did a double feature of 2 horror movies and we were all cuddled up on the couch sharing a blanket together and what not, getting really close. When the second movie finished around 4-5am we decided it was late and that they should get an uber home. I ordered it and it was on its way, but for some reason i still decided to tell Zoe that I wanted to kiss them really badly, first Zoe said that they didn‚Äôt want to hurt me, which implies they aren‚Äôt looking for anything serious, to which I said i‚Äôd be okay, hormones kinda taking control, and the. they consented and we started making out, so much so that we missed the uber, and then they spent the night. We didn‚Äôt end up getting to bed until around 7-8am for various reasons. I woke up at about 1pm, my body refuses 8 hours of sleep, but they kept sleeping until almost 5. That day did it, something about relaxing in bed all day while having this sleeping beauty next to me changed something inside me, i didn‚Äôt want this to end, and I wanted it more. Once they left things were still good and the texting stayed flirty. One message Zoe sent was about how comfy my bed was and how they needed to sleep in it again, so to me, things were progressing. A couple days after that they came to a dinner party i hosted with close friends, a very soft launch of sorts, and it went super well, every one liked Zoe, and i did too a little more. At this point we‚Äôve seen each other almost every day since we‚Äôve met and i‚Äôm starting to feel the early signs of falling for Zoe. The next night we hung out we had a deep conversation about boundaries and what weee looking for, i found out Zoe was only 2 months out of a 2 year relationship and things were still very difficult for them. Zoe said they needed time to think about everything, i did also tell Zoe that I was looking for more, i‚Äôve been out of a relationship for almost a year, and my last serious one was almost 2 years ago. Anyway the next day we went and played pool for a couple hours at a local bar, no one was there so we got 9 games in a row, and it was a lot of fun, things were still very flirty but when i brought up the idea of us sleeping together again, they shut it down. It didn‚Äôt sour the evening or anything, but I was a tad bummed out. Still, Zoe stopped by my work later when I went in and said something that really changed me, Zoe said they loved me before they left. The next day I was holiday shopping and stopped in Zoe‚Äôs work while they were bartending, it ended up getting so busy that they didn‚Äôt have a chance to pick up their medicine; so i was like, i got you. i ran to their pharmacy got the meds, and came back only to find out it was only 1 of the 2 needed bottles, so i insisted on going back, that‚Äôs when i learned that the other bottle was filled at a different location, no big deal, so i got that to. Zoe was super appreciative, and i assured her i‚Äôd do anything for her. They stopped by my bar later that night (i go into work super late sometimes) and we chatted and things were looking good. The next night things unraveled a little. When Zoe came into my work the next night i was filled with more desire than ever, i genuinely had started to fall for Zoe, that damn smile and those gorgeous eyes had finally broken me down, and i couldn‚Äôt help but be a flirt. Most of it was received pretty well and one of Zoe‚Äôs coworkers who came by too kinda keyed into it. Me and him talked because he wanted the tea and i spilled a bit. Zoe caught wind of our conversation and confronted me at the end of the night and i confirmed I had told their coworker some stuff, nothing in great detail, but an overview, Zoe wasn‚Äôt mad, but a little anxious that i did that. The next day we met up, biked around the city and got coffee together. We had a straight forward conversation, Zoe wants to keep things platonic, stating that they are still in love with their Ex who broke up with them, and wasn‚Äôt ready for anything else. Zoe also said that when they say they love me, they mean it in a general sense and not romantically. Then we both trauma dumped, gave all our lore to each other and really deepened our bond. At this point i‚Äôm trying so hard not to fall in love, but I think i already have, it doesn‚Äôt help that Zoe said they wish that they could‚Äôve felt as much love from their ex as they were willing to give, and i‚Äôm not sitting across a table from Zoe thinking I would be willing to give you the world. Again i went to work after and Zoe stopped by as normal, and things were cool. The next night we did another double feature movie at my place, but this time we didn‚Äôt share a blanket, and no funny buisness went down, i really want to respect Zoe‚Äôs boundaries, i care deeply for Zoe and want to make sure that they‚Äôre getting exactly the care that they need right now. Finally we have yesterday, i‚Äôve been going out so much lately that i needed a day of rest so i kinda shut my phone off and relaxed, i ended up writing a song and painting most of the day, and it was pretty great. Then around midnight, Zoe texts me asking if i‚Äôm at work, which i wasn‚Äôt, cause they wanted to stop by. I said I was at home hut if they wanted to talk on the phone we could, Zoe said maybe, after w
they went to a bar we could possibly talk. I‚Äôm like, okay, no big, but then an hour later i asked again cause i was getting pretty tired, and same answer, they hadn‚Äôt left to go home yet. So im just chilling in bed, hoping they call cause I want to hear Zoe‚Äôs voice, and that when they tell me that they‚Äôre going to go to a friends house, at 2am. This made me jealous and restless, the first time i had felt anything negative from everything. i had started to write out some long text to send about not getting what i need out of this relationship, but i stopped writing it because ive made this very mistake so many times in the past, i calmed myself down by drawing and assured myself i NEED to give Zoe the time and space they deserve, that regardless of being a friend or partner I want to make them happy and give them the best support i possibly can. So i went to bed. Zoe ended up texting me again around 4am that their friend Kat had returned from overseas and they were kiki‚Äôing late into the night. So i definitely made the right call to not blow everything the fuck up, Personal growth??? 

I just woke up and haven‚Äôt texted Zoe back yet and honestly i feel like i‚Äôm at a crossroads of sorts, I could use any bit of advice right now. 

TL:DR 
Falling for someone who recently got out of a long term relationship, and they aren‚Äôt quite ready for anything but I think we are a really great match with obvious attraction to one another.

I've got some of the basics covered like a gift card for a coffee shop, ordering lunch, taking everyone out for a drink after work.

There's iced and hot teas, freshed brewed coffee, and crockpots holding hot apple cider (NA, spicy and flavorful!) and of course my famous hot chocolate station! It's indulgent just as it is, but feel free to add whipped cream, sprinkles, syrup, mini marshmallows, and candy cane stir sticks. It's dessert in a mug! 

I've decided to make a celebratory post about finally EARNING this 779 that our badgebot often forces on us. I started seeing 779 instead of my proper count around my 9-month mark. I had learned by this point that (bizarrely enough!) our badge can look correct to others but glitchy to ourselves. I also know this is not an SD repairable thing, it is a Reddit glitch. It's a minor inconvenience really. I found the free app I Am Sober to help me see my accurate day count. 

Speaking of accurate day counts, in my first week I didn't like how my first day sober had to be represented as day zero, which occurs as the first couple of sober days showing ""1 day"" in the badge. So I set my date to be the last day I drank so that my first day sober showed as my day one. However I saw the problem with my plan as I approached my first soberversary. I didn't want November 1st as the date of my sober anniversary! I sent a text to the [badgebot request](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=badgebot&subject=stopdrinking) with the correct date of my first sober day: 2022-11-02 in the format required. I lost a day and gained back accuracy. 

Our first day of not drinking is Day Zero. It's a blank slate where we rebuild a better life from. Sobriety is a fresh start! I am proud to be a non-drinker, and I'm proud of everyone here at StopDrinking no matter your day count. 

Here's to sober celebrations! Let's enjoy all the non-alcoholic beverages and treats available!! üéâ‚ú®Ô∏èüéäüßÅ And let's have fun with our milestones. Cheers! ‚òïÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è‚ú®Ô∏è ",3,1734717487.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôll just share the last occurrence because honestly the lady was pretty chill.

So im looking at battery powered Christmas lights on an end cap DEEP in thought about what kind of crafting I could do with them. A lady asks me if some item was included in the 50% off Christmas things. I say ‚ÄúIDK, seems pretty Christmasy to me.‚Äù She then reads off verbatim a sign that states what‚Äôs included at 50% off, what‚Äôs included at 30%, etc. I just say ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs giving 50% off vibes to me, but I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù She politely says ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll see at the register and if it is 50% off I‚Äôll get it and if it‚Äôs not I won‚Äôt.‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs what I would do.‚Äù

She comes around the corner and says ‚ÄúOMG, you don‚Äôt work here.‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúLOL, Nope. I clean teeth‚Äù. 

To be fair I had on a sweatshirt over my top. She thought my was cross body bag was a lanyard. I don‚Äôt remember what color scrubs I had on but they may have been the same color as the vests employees wear. 

I guess I just wanted to tell this story because if I were an employee of Hobby Lobby, I would have been the shittiest employee ever, and she was so nice the whole time. I had a man yell at me once over coffee in Aldi even after I told him I dont work there, so this was a nice change for being mistaken for an employee. ",4,1734717481.0,IDontWorkHereLady,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share the experience launching my first-ever app, hoping it might encourage some other new founders out there to take the leap. This journey has definitely shifted my perspective on a lot of things!

I just on a passionate whim launched¬†[Fyenance](https://fyenanceapp.com/), a personal finance app I built over a recent weekend, mostly for myself, and decided to share it with the world. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much.. just wanted to see what would happen to put it out there.

Well, here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been going so far..

* 60 paying users already, just from a couple posts and word of mouth
* $400 in revenue - just organically!
* The feedback has been incredibly validating, especially hearing how much people appreciate the app‚Äôs simplicity.

Fyenance was born out of a personal need. As someone who‚Äôs tried nearly every finance app out there, I always felt like they were overcomplicated or just too hands-off. I wanted something that felt more intentional‚Äîsomething I could sit with for a few minutes each weekend, coffee in hand, to truly understand my finances.

The app is super simple:

* You manually track your finances, avoiding the miscategorized chaos of automation.
* It‚Äôs beginner-friendly, with an intuitive design.
* It focuses on making you feel connected to your budget, not overwhelmed.

What‚Äôs been most surprising is how much people resonate with this concept. It turns out I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs been frustrated by existing tools.

While 60 users might not sound like a lot, to me, it feels like a massive milestone‚Äîespecially since this started as just a small personal project.

If you‚Äôve been sitting on an idea, unsure if it‚Äôs worth launching, my advice is to just go for it. You don‚Äôt need everything to be perfect or polished. Sometimes, all it takes is putting yourself out there to see what happens. ü§ûüèº",4,1734717297.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

They make their chickens and cats and birds **come on our property** bc they know that we feed our own pets quite well, they never spent a dollar on their pet food theyll give them like scraps like fish bones or fish water or some crap like that. they i**ntentionally tried to burn our house** down by burning a tree very close to our electricity pole but we had to go and stop it because they refused to water it down, saying that they were ants on it... BUT ANTS ARE EVERYWHERE HELLO?? ITS NATURE??! **They built a whole other 2 story house behind their house in direct view of our lawn** so that they can see what were doing in our backyard and put majority of the windows that face our house so that they can see us from all angles. and then theyll continously talk about me or my other family member, being like ""theyre not even daughters, theyre like sons they work so heavy and hard"" which is so mf rude. whenever they drive past our house they drive very VERY slowly so they can see if weve planted anything new in the front or put anything or cleaned anything up. theyre terribly OBSESSED with our family and most of the community here has shunned them out before duh, theyre terrible people but theyre obsessed with us prob because were from the same country so they feel as if were the ""same"". BTW, in this family there are the parents, 3 kids (2 sons and 1 daughter) and a grandma. ***the poeple im talking about are the parents. t***he kids is like whatever they just stay home all day so idc. recently my mom was talking to the grandma and the grandma said ""yeah theyre always talking about you. how your oldest cooks alot and goes to a great university and your youngest always works hard outside. and they never stop talking about how beautiful they are"" HELLO??? HOW ARE WE THE CONSTANT CONVERSATION TOPIC?? Im scared because they do practice black magic/witchcraft despite being ""strictly religious"" and its a very scary thing to be getting this much evil eye constantly. the creepiest thing happening so far is that they were actually my neighbors one house down but recently bought the house next to us since the owner passed away and thats when all of this annoying shit theyve been doing started bc theyre even closer to us. hes always outside, working on something as a decoy when hes really just being silent and trying to go near our house to hear our conversations. everytime were outside FROM SOMEWHERE the dad just pops up and starts digging or something. it doesnt matter of time of day, hes always --- i mean ALWAYS --- outside whenever we go anywhere. last night, we came back from a party around 2am in the morning and OUT OF NOWWHERE the dad came outside and starting like idk fixing the plant pots and shit. HELLO??? AT 2AM IN THEMORNING??? and the ABSOLUTE WORST is how snoopy they are --- where are you going, where did you buy your clothes, is that your car, did you pkant new flowers, why did you give your bird you couldve given it to us and we couldve eaten it. they say the most craziest shit to our face. theyve even said that theyll build a whole nother house behind the second house they built just so that they can see what were doing INSIDE of our home instead of just our lawn and outside area. 

they are NOT good people and CANNOT be trusted. they want to be us, have us, have everything we have. They even went as far as CHANGING the way that they look to dress like us. If I wear pink one day, the mom will wear pink the next day. **its like we give them some sort of exit, some sort of joy when they stalk us**. they have no friends just theyre family and just stay home all day or go to their job. anyone we know, they have to know. 

I have a big yard but i cant even enjoy this shit without being terrified that theyre stalking me and looking at me. i cant walk knowing that if i get a cup of coffee and theyll also make a cup of coffee and sit infront of the window and just watch me. i just want to be left alone. i like my privacy. i like my peace. but its been a rough couple of months and im scared and even writing this gives me goosebumps. this isnt even half of the crap that theyve done to us but its still alot. 

the funniest thing is that its not just them, the mom has a younger sister and older brother. they both have their own families **AND THEYRE ALSO OBSESSED WITH US AS WELL.** thank god they dont live in the same neighboorhood or i wouldve moved out a long time ago. the older brother has a daughter around my age and oh my god ---- even in front of me, he tells his daughter to become like me. like exactly like me. when i bought my first pair of glasses, he bought his daughter a similar type. he told her to work hard and go into the same uni as me and do the same degree. scariest thing is that she grew out her hair exactly like mine and anytime she sees me shes always asking me ""arent we alike? arent we the same?""

Then I cook breakfast around 7:30 and eat it, which is usually eggs and sausage and fruit maybe avocado. usually get diarrhea about an hour later. I have ibs and eoe. Question is, it's weird the timing of the diarrhea seems the same each day. Could it still be the quinoa for lunch? Is it the black coffee in the morning? Is it something I ate for dinner?

So, this is my second go around at this. I thought I had found a family member, but they turned out to be not who they said they was, so here I go again, with full positivity to find family.

So. About Me. Well, as the title says, I'm 42 from the US and a happily married to the best hubby ever.  I definitely pride myself in being kind, compassionate, and thoughtful. I know myself to be very respectful of others and like to make others feel like they're worth something. My dad always taught me to treat others as you would like, and I always try to do that. I tend to be overly compassionate and kind and sadly, others try to take advantage of that as with the previous situation. No regrets though. It's Santa time and no better time to unwrap a new family member under my family Christmas tree. :)

So, why am I here or what am I looking for? Well, Me and my hubby are so happily married and I'm so very blessed in life but to a point, we are missing something. We have so much love and not anyone to give it to. I lost my dad a year ago and in the last week, a close family member and it makes you really think about your place in life and realizing you only got one shot and I want to be able to give what experience, advice, and memories I have had over my years and maybe pass on anything when it's my time to go.  I want to be able to be a positive male role model for someone who may not had the words ""I'm proud of you or I love you son"". I know these are just words, but they are words I was afforded with my dad, and I want to be able to afford that to someone else who hasn't been blessed with that. We all have a road to travel, so why not travel it with someone who cares about you.

So what about me: Well, I'm actually a pretty boring introverted person with an outverted heart who loves to play video games, watch movies, listen to asmr (monk chanting), and sip warm tea or coffee on lazy days. I have a PC and Series X for those that it matters to. I also like to discuss deep life subjects, meaning of life and hear about other's great adventures. I love to listen even though I can talk a lot when I get going.  I am also open to like and learn new things about others and what's important in their lives. I don't know much about being young now days, so I am all ears and brain to listen to learn new, exciting things.

What am I looking for? First, you must be from the USA. I'm not saying this to be harsh but at some point, I want this to be not just an online thing but real family and meet one day. Being outside of USA is just not really an option. I won't stray from that must, so sorry to others outside USA. Second, you must be honest about who you are and where u from. No saying you from the USA and lying about it. I had that in previous situation and won't do it again. Just be honest and respectful of that. Truth always comes out. There will be a point of voice chat and stuff to prove who we are, so be mindful of that. It's no rush. That takes a lot of time, so if you have no intention of ever doing that, pass me up. I will always be honest and open as long as you are. Last but not least, understand this is strictly respectful platonic. I'm not here for anything else or anything shady. If you try that, I will block you. That situation has happened before. This is a place for love respect, and family, and we all need to treat it as such. My heart is pure and yours need to be as well. Just know, if you decide to message, you will be treated with dignity, respect, and i will doe everything to make you feel safe around me. My only intention is making a positive impact in another's life.

Well, that was a long message. If you can get through that without sleeping, you made it the end of family Candyland and we are officially family. lol. Well, not yet but who knows. Just send me a message. You know how this works

His Dr has been doing all sorts of tests to see why he is experiencing so much mental decline. 

But my mom found his stash of whiskey late last and he admitted that he is still drinking and that he might be an alcoholic.  He also told her that he was trying to drink himself to death, but he doesn't remember that. On top of this, he's English so he has never really talked about his feelings and all that. 

He begrudgingly agreed to let me take him to one single AA meeting today. It's a closed meeting so I'll spend that hour at a coffee shop or shops. He really only agreed to the meeting to get us to leave him alone since he thinks he can do this on his own. 

I have a 7 year old son whom he loves more than anything. Can I tell my dad that my son would be so devastated if something happened to him? (He already lost his other grandfather due to cigarette smoking a few months ago). Would that help motivate him or just make him feel worse?

1hiorv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1hiorv3/10_years_of_slavery_ch21/,10 Years of Slavery - Ch.21,"After Ellie left, I sat in our empty room and thought. I said to myself that there's no way around it. You have to endure it. There's no use in feeling restless, uneasy, or rebel against; this is your fate. The path is clear, bow your head, and follow your fate.

There was no point for protesting or pretending. My feelings or objections did not matter for her. And feeling bad about her attitude wouldn't make any difference. I had two options; first to put an end to this and disappear from her life, or just stop feeling bad and endure the humiliation to the end, wherever it takes to me.

I picked the second way. I have no regrets.

I knew that I pushed myself towards this many times before, but then found myself again in agony for what she was doing to me. But at that point, I decided to enjoy it consciously. I had to face with my real personality; I was a submissive. I ignored it, pretended that it's not there maybe for many years, but there were no places to hide for me anymore. Only way to survive was to enjoy what's happening. Let myself consciously accept submissiveness and slave nature. From that point, I decided to push myself actively to enjoy it. And do not feel bad about humiliation, instead even internalise it. Enjoy being worthless, enjoy being ignored, humiliated, defamated. Crave for it even. As she expected from me; enjoy giving up on her. Enjoy not having a dignity. Enjoy crawling in agony, in jealousy. Make the pain your source of pleasure. As there is no other ways to cure this pain.

Enjoy sucking her toes or eating her not because it gives me pleasure in any way, but it gives her a pleasure. Enjoy when she fucks someone, encourage her to have sex. Prepare her for someone else. Pick her dresses, manicure her nails, compliment her hair, drive her to dates. And enjoy giving her away. Without expecting to taste her divine womanhood yourself. Ever.

Get rid of your ego completely, and be a part of Ellie. Like her lungs, her hands, her feet, her emotions. Just be another part of her. Following commands and desires of its owner without its own willpower.

So did I.

I was a submissive, slave-natured man and thanks to Ellie's perfect care I was now at peace with myself.

I laid on my bed, and started imagining her getting fucked by Kyle. I tried to visualise how she gave him a handjob, how he looked at her, what she felt when his hot cum sprayed in her hand. How he is probably sucking her tits now, how he is sliding inside her. Then I thought how I got down on my knees and put on her socks in front of Kyle. How I kissed her feet in front of everyone. What they might have thought about me. And it gave me an immense pleasure. For the first time, I was actively enjoying the humiliation, instead of resisting it or sweeping it under the rug.

At some point, I was so overflowed with the excitement and arousal, I picked the socks I put on her sweet feet just hours ago with an humiliating ritual, placed them on my face, and masturbated. I was actively disobeying the orders now, but for a greater purpose. I was sure that she can understand me. I was internalising the humiliation via pleasure. I was facing the demon living in me, and letting him free. It took me less than five seconds to orgasm. First of my very rare orgasms as a true slave.

...

...

Ellie came back later that night, and slid inside the bed fully naked. The luscious smell of her sweaty skin filled the room, and we fell asleep next to each other without saying a word.

When I woke up, Kyle was already gone. Once Ellie woke up I ran her a bath as she was having her morning coffee and drenching her naked body with morning sun on the couch.

""Hope you had fun last night babe?"" I said to her when she got in the bathtub.

""Yeah, it was good. And fun too, he tried to keep silent but I pushed his limits."" she laughed. ""Did you hear anything or should I try harder next time?""

""I haven't heard anything actually. But I can see in your smile that you it was indeed a good sex.""

""Well, not particularly amazing but yeah it was good.""

It was just another morning-after-sex with her. But it was a special day for me. I wanted to talk with her about my thoughts last night. I was hoping to make her happy by showing the new levels of my dedication. I was also planning to ask for forgiveness for cumming.

""Ellie, I actually wanted to talk about something...""

""But I don't. Go and prepare my breakfast."" She cut me off with a commanding voice. I thought for a second that she thought I am going to complain again, and that's why I was cut off. So I had to explain myself:

""No I'm not going to....""

""I said breakfast pinky. Chop chop!""

""Sure Ellie, will be ready in 15.""

I left the bathroom. Again, she was indifferent to my feelings, thoughts, agony, or enjoyment. But I was OK. She didn't need to listen to me. She didn't need to do anything. I felt proud for not feeling bad this time.

However, there was still my confession to be made. So when she was having her breakfast, I silently kneeled in front of her and told her what I did last night. Then, I felt I need to explain more and summarised my train of thought as much as possible to her. Her response was almost perfect:

""You're sweet pinky, but also so dramatic... it was just sex. I was horny and fucked someone. I wasn't trying to ""humiliate"" you or whatever. Chill out. Go with the flow and stop overthinking about everything. You put on my socks in front of the guy who's fucking me. So what?"" She had another bite from her toast before continuing:

""But you're on the right track. I appreciate it. You're getting better every day. Still, it doesn't change the fact that you misbehaved. Putting my socks on your wherever doesn't make it any better. I'll think about a proper punishment for it. Don't do it ever again without my permission. Understood?""

""Understood, I'm sorry.""

After the breakfast, Ellie called me to the living room and ordered me to get naked. I took off everything and stood in front of her. I was rock hard. She started studying my dick with her fingers, ran her middle finger through my shaft, tapped on the tip, gently carressed my balls. I was watching her every single movement and trying to etch it to my memory. This was a sight I hadn't seen for a very long time; Ellie touching my penis!

""Your punishment will be knowing that you have no shortcomings compared to other people I actually fucked. You're even bigger and better-shaped than some. Shape is important too, you know? Especially when blowing. I sucked uglier dicks. If it wasn't attached to you I'm sure I'd love to taste this one too. And you're pretty good-looking actually. I genuinely believe that you would be a great fuck. And I know that a lot of girls would be happily go to bed with you. But you will never taste it. At least for any foreseeable future. I will never let you put your thing in anything, a girl, boy or a toy. I will rarely allow you to orgasm. Very rarely., only when it's absolutely physically necessary. And I'm sure you'll have some wet dreams once in a while to get rid of the excess anyways. So you're not even allowed to ask for it. You will sit in your room and cry with balls full of cum, while there are a lot of girls waiting to drain you. And I will drain others while you cry for me. OK?""

""Of course Ellie. Thank you. I don't desire anyone else anyways. Thank you...""

....

She went to Kyle's place a couple days later, again ""to study"". We picked her a set of very sexy lingerie together. Then she put on an oversized hoodie and joggers on top of that elegant underwear, saying that it'll be a fun suprise for Kyle. I drove her off and dropped her to Kyle's flat, which he shares with two other guys.

I was still finding it very dangerous. Not for personal or selfish reasons, but I was worried that people might talk about Ellie and Kyle, which might hurt her. Someone could say something stupid and she might be upset. Or whatever. You got me. Which actually happened just a couple days after her visit to Kyle's room. A friend of mine, who's clueless about what's happening in general, pulled me aside to talk and told me that people are talking about something's going on between Ellie and Kyle, and no disrespect but he thought that I should know. I didn't react much but I told him that I knew that they are studying on something together, and I was mostly present with them so nothing actually happens and pretended to get very angry on whoever is talking about this bullshit.

But it was something to be addressed, so I talked to Ellie the same evening. I tried to be as respectful as possible, and told her about the thing my friend was talking about. It made her extremely upset indeed. She loved being slutty, but being known as a ""slut who's cheating on her boyfriend"" was a title she wasn't willing to carry. I wanted to say ""I said so"", but as a very well-trained slave, I told her instead that we should do something to put this an end.

""You know what Pinky, all of the girls are cheating their boyfriends. All the girls. That thick fuck Daron doesn't know but Beth fucked both Kyle and Simon. Grace sucked a guy she doesn't even know while she was with Martin. Cora literally went to a holiday with another guy while she had a boyfriend. I'm sure their boyfriends have some flings too. And now people are talking about me and Kyle?""

""Wow"" I thought to myself. ""It's more of a fuckfest of degeneration than a college campus and I'm the only virgin who's right in the middle."" But I kept my thoughts to myself. After calmed down a little, she called Kyle and they argued over the phone as if I'm not at the room. Ellie was blaming him for being loose-lipped and Kyle was swearing that he didn't tell anyone anything. Obviously no-one admitted any wrongdoings but to this day I'm quite certain that Kyle, that rude bastard, probably bragged about getting laid with Ellie here and there and that's how the word got out.

After that day they didn't see each other again, and carried out a distant friendship within their group. Although the rumours had ceased after a while, I managed to catch some questioning glimpses from people.

...

But this gossip ended up in a completely unexpected result, at my expense.

It was soon after their break-up with Kyle. She came home late in the evening, after having a dinner with Ava. I was busy with one of her assignments, which was something she probably didn't even have an idea about. By then I was tasked to keep track of assignment emails, prepare the assignment as well as a summary for her by due date, just in case professor asks a question. So, she was made aware of most of the assignments when I hand her the summary sheet.

She jumped on the armchair, hanging her feet over one of the armrests. I dutifully got up and started taking off her white sneakers. It was then, she told me that she decided to announce our break-up. I did stop briefly, until she nudged me with her shoe -the I one I yet to move. I felt heartbroken, but didn't say anything. I was well aware that we were not a couple for a very long time, but announcing it to people was still something to feel bad about. But I was also not clear what she had in mind. I didn't interrupt my important task of taking off her shoes, and let her speak:

""You will move to the guest room and we'll announce people that we are not together anymore. But we'll keep living together as roommates as it's too expensive to find a new place and move, and we're still great friends and going to be the best roommates. So then we won't need to think about what people are gossiping about and have more freedom. And meanwhile we can still live together and you can serve me. Also you won't need to worry about being ""humiliated"" when I get laid with someone. Isn't it genius?""

It was smart indeed. I placed a kiss on her sole, and told her that I liked the idea.",1,1734715364.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

These guys say they're so alpha big d\*ck then complain about having to approach women. Just on this subreddit I saw a post saying ""dating as a man sucks!"" like no it doesn't. Just approach women and talk to them. If you get rejected you get rejected, if you don't you don't, and you maybe meet a cool partner.

This starts from people being so starved for attention and affection that they look at any woman like a piece of meat, even if they don't realize it.

The pathetic nice guy stems from the biggest pit of insecurity imagineable. No this isn't a ""lover of women (6'5 btw)"" post. Believe me, I'm not looking for any relationships on reddit.

Edit:

Here guys. A comprehensive guide on entering a healthy relationship:

1. work on yourself. if you're fat, haven't showered in a week and have cheeto dust on your fingers and shirt, you don't like yourself. Let alone any self respecting girl.
2. Put yourself out there. Get a hobby, go hiking, biking, walking, etc. Improve your life through these hobbies. Drop the reddit PLEASE.
3. Go outside more and if you see a pretty girl approach her. Say go to a coffee shop, a yogurt shop, etc etc. If you see someone you find attractive, you can walk up and say that. ""Hey I saw you from across the shop and thought you were gorgeous, and I'd love to get to know you more. Would you mind grabbing coffee"". (EXAMPLE. Just be chill and don't salivate from the mouth).
4. If she says yes cool. If she says no or that she has a boyfriend also cool. Just say something like ""Lucky guy. Have a wonderful day.""

remember that a date is so that YOU can figure out if the girl is the right one for you. NOT to convince her you're the right one for her. REMEMBER THIS DISTINCTION.",6,1734714844.0,self,30,0.59,False
1hiokfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1hiokfy/how_is_this_sustainable/,How is this sustainable?,"I (50M) was in a pretty good mood, woke up early because I couldn't sleep, as usual. Relatively decent mood, for me, things were going fine. My wife woke up and made her coffee and sat down visibly preoccupied. I asked her how she felt and she broke character and sort of spilled, talking about her job demands and their unreal expectations, money, and its dwindling nature, her college classes start back up in January, and then she fell silent. I was devastated so much was on her mind so I intuitively asked, ""what can I do to make things easier on you?"" She didn't respond and just looked at me. It was supposed to be about her and how I could help and then I twisted it all around to be about me and then completely lost my cool and burst into tears. I am hopelessly broken. 

I'm disabled because of bipolar. I'm immobile because my back and neck are all broken and twisted. I also have a list of other things that are wrong with me. Hell, I have trouble comprehending simple tasks, never mind anything complex. And I ask what I can do better. üò∂ I'm useless on a good day. Try being of value!

Have you ever emotionally crashed so hard, so fast, that you can physically feel it like something dropped inside of you? Yeah. That. 

We both went silent. She finally tried to make me feel better but I already crashed. In an instant. 

This isn't sustainable. I can't crash like this over stupid junk. But I can't stop. And I can see it's killing her just as it's killing me. I hate being me. I hate being alive. What's the point? I'm on so many medicines just to be able to stay alive. I'm begging. What's the point?",2,1734714835.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

1hioi44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hioi44/never_had_this_happen_dont_want_to_hurt_feelings/,"Never had this happen, don't want to hurt feelings","I (36M) have never had a GF, Since grade school I always believed I was the ugliest person there was even though I would be considered ""normal"" or average.  But because of this I just never really bothered asking anyone out.  Occasionally, friends would try and give me a push and I would ask someone on a date but would get turned down each time.  I only asked out maybe 5 or 6 girls my whole life, but around 29-30 I just stopped giving it much thought, although I did meet someone about a year ago that I really liked.

So fast forward to last week, we have a xmas work banquet.  One of the managers of one of the departments I help asked if I was going and I told her I was and she said good cause she wanted to set me up with someone.  Now, I have had 1 or 2 people do this in the past where they suddenly tell me they want to set me up with so and so who i have never met and whatnot, and it makes my anxiety go through the roof, cause I am pretty nervous around people I have never met until I get to know them more.  The 2 times in the past that this has happened, I actually did like one of them, but I was so anxious and nervous I couldn't really be myself and she could probably tell and I never heard from that person again.  the other one I actually realized I had nothing in common and wasn't attracted in any way to her and again I never heard from that one again either.



Well, this manager told me what she would be wearing, and so at the banquet I noticed this person was one of the employees of this department that I help, and I have helped her before with some work stuff.  So towards later part of banquet I went over to their table to chat with everyone as everyone at my table left.  And so I chatted with her as well, just being friendly.

Well, the manager told me the other day she thought I was into her and she gave me a note with her phone number and said feel free to txt her, but if I don't that is totally fine and nothing will be weird if I choose that.

  
To be frank I have never had something like this happen.  I am not really looking for a relationship, I would be fine being friends, but I don't know if she expects a relationship kind of thing or not.  I will admit that a small part of me does want to experience a relationship, but I don't know, I just odn't want to hurt her feelings by not texting her.  There was a woman last year I had met that we had a good amount in common, and I worked up the nerve to add her on FB and send her a message about grabbing a coffee while I was in town, but she had something going on that day and said maybe another time.  I got so afraid that the message was code for ""Never speak to again you are ugly as hell"" that I have been afraid to message her since and I guess I still have a bit of a crush on her.

So because of that I am afraid of txting this girl, but I could use a woman's eye for getting some nice clothes and was thinking of txting her to see if she wanted to go shopping some weekend.

-----------------------------------------------

Let's face it, our furry companions mean the world to us. We'd do anything to ensure their well-being, right down to the twinkle in their eyes. But what happens when that twinkle dims, replaced by redness, discharge, or discomfort? Suddenly, we're bombarded with questions, worries, and a desperate need for answers. One common query that often pops up is the use of human eye drops, specifically ‚ÄúCan C Eye Drops for Dogs.‚Äù While the desire to alleviate our pet's suffering is understandable, using human medications on animals can be a tricky business. This article delves deep into the subject, exploring the safety, risks, and alternatives associated with using human eye drops on dogs, specifically addressing the question, ‚ÄúCan C Eye Drops for Dogs?‚Äù We'll cover everything from common canine eye ailments to understanding the ingredients in human eye drops, ensuring you're well-equipped to make informed decisions regarding your four-legged friend‚Äôs eye health. So, buckle up, grab a cup of coffee, and let's navigate the world of canine ocular care together.

### Decoding Canine Eye Issues: Why Clarity Matters

Before we jump into the ""Can C Eye Drops for Dogs"" debate, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the diverse landscape of canine eye problems. From pesky allergies to more serious infections, a range of issues can affect a dog‚Äôs vision and comfort. Just like us, dogs can experience dry eye, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and even cataracts. Recognizing the symptoms is the first step towards finding the right solution. Is your dog squinting excessively? Do you notice any cloudiness or unusual discharge? Perhaps their eyes seem redder than usual. These subtle clues often indicate an underlying issue requiring attention. Understanding the specific problem is paramount before considering any treatment, whether over-the-counter or prescribed by a vet.

- **Common Eye Problems in Dogs:**
    - Conjunctivitis: Inflammation of the conjunctiva, often caused by allergies, irritants, or infections.
    - Dry Eye (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca, KCS): Insufficient tear production, leading to dryness, irritation, and potential corneal damage.
    - Corneal Ulcers: Painful sores or abrasions on the cornea, often requiring specialized treatment.
    - Cataracts: Cloudiness in the lens of the eye, affecting vision and potentially leading to blindness.
    - Glaucoma: Increased intraocular pressure, a serious condition that can cause pain and vision loss.
    - Allergies: Environmental or food allergies can manifest as itchy, watery eyes.

### Can C Eye Drops for Dogs: Navigating the Risks and Concerns

So, you‚Äôre staring at that bottle of human eye drops, wondering if it's okay to use on your furry pal. Let's get one thing straight: using human medications on animals can be a risky proposition. While certain human medications can be safely administered to pets under veterinary supervision, self-treating your dog with human eye drops, especially Can C, isn't recommended. Why? Well, the formulation of human eye drops often contains ingredients that are safe for humans but may not be suitable for dogs. Moreover, the underlying cause of your dog's eye problem could be something entirely different from what Can C is designed to treat. Using the wrong medication could exacerbate the issue or mask the symptoms, delaying proper diagnosis and treatment. Remember, your dog's eyes are delicate organs, and experimenting with unapproved medications could have unintended consequences.

- **Potential Dangers of Using Human Eye Drops on Dogs:**
    - Incorrect Diagnosis and Treatment: Masking symptoms and delaying proper veterinary care.
    - Allergic Reactions: Dogs can be sensitive to certain ingredients in human eye drops.
    - Further Irritation: The wrong medication can worsen existing eye problems.
    - Toxic Effects: Some human medications are toxic to dogs.

### Understanding Can C Eye Drops: What's Inside Matters

Before we delve further into the ""Can C Eye Drops for Dogs"" question, let's dissect the composition of these drops. Can C typically contains naphazoline, a vasoconstrictor that reduces redness by narrowing blood vessels. While effective for temporary relief of redness in humans, this isn't necessarily a solution for underlying canine eye problems. In fact, the rebound effect, where redness can worsen after the drops wear off, is a common concern. Furthermore, Can C often contains other ingredients, like preservatives, that could irritate a dog's sensitive eyes. Ultimately, the risks associated with using Can C in dogs far outweigh any potential (and often temporary) benefits.

- **Key Ingredients in Can C Eye Drops:**
    - Naphazoline Hydrochloride: A vasoconstrictor that reduces redness.
    - Pheniramine Maleate: An antihistamine that helps relieve itchiness (in some formulations).
    - Preservatives: These can irritate a dog‚Äôs eyes.

### Safeguarding Your Pup's Peepers: Veterinary-Approved Alternatives

Now that we've established why using human eye drops like Can C isn't a good idea for dogs, let's explore some safer, veterinary-approved alternatives. Your veterinarian is the best resource for diagnosing and treating your dog‚Äôs eye issues. They can determine the underlying cause of the problem and prescribe appropriate medication specifically formulated for canine eyes. This could include antibiotic eye drops for infections, anti-inflammatory drops for allergies, or lubricating drops for dry eye. Remember, peace of mind comes from knowing you‚Äôre providing your furry friend with the best possible care, and that starts with professional guidance.

- **Veterinary-Approved Eye Care Options for Dogs:**
    - Prescription Eye Drops: Tailored to specific conditions and formulated for canine eyes.
    - Artificial Tears: Lubricating drops for dry eye.
    - Eye Washes/Cleansers: For removing debris and discharge.

### ""Can C Eye Drops for Dogs"": The Bottom Line ‚Äì A Veterinarian‚Äôs Perspective

Let's reiterate the key takeaway: avoid using human eye drops, including Can C, on your dog. While it's tempting to reach for a quick fix, the potential risks outweigh any perceived benefits. Consulting your veterinarian is crucial. They possess the expertise to diagnose the specific eye condition and prescribe the most appropriate and safe treatment. Remember, when it comes to your dog‚Äôs health, especially their precious eyesight, professional advice trumps all. Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to your vet at the first sign of eye trouble.

1. What should I do if my dog's eye is red and watery? Contact your veterinarian immediately. Redness and watering can indicate various issues, from allergies to infections.
2. Can I use over-the-counter eye drops for my dog? No, it‚Äôs crucial to consult your vet before using any medication on your dog, including over-the-counter eye drops.

### Conclusion

Always prioritize your dog's safety and well-being by consulting your veterinarian for any eye concerns.

The beans were roaster on the 3rd of december.
My question is, should I freeze the beans until 31. of December?
I'm not planning to open the pack before so I'd tape the airing thing and freeze the whole bag.

We have been together for 6-7 years We have 2 small children together ages 3 years and 4 months. I am a SAHM while hubby works full time. We have been arguing constantly for about months. The only time we‚Äôre not fighting is when we‚Äôre sleeping or having s*x. We don‚Äôt fight about money or anything like that but about what I do all day and why the house isn‚Äôt spotless. I am NC with my family and so is Jon so it‚Äôs just us. However when my baby was 2 month old I was struggling with ppa. I called a friend of mine to talk to and I was explaining what was going on. As she went through ppa and ppd and Jon told me last night that calling was disrespectful to him. And if I‚Äôm not going to clean the house then I should put the kids in a daycare and get a job. Also my baby is strictly Breast fed and baby don‚Äôt respond to bottles. If I were to get a job then it would only cover cost of child care. The house is clean but not spotless. There‚Äôs always a mess in one way or another. I‚Äôm constantly cleaning cooking nursing and it never seems to be enough. 

Jon told me that I am no longer allowed to get my nails done or go get new makeup when I run out of something because I care more about my personal appearance than the house. He was telling me to act like im putting makeup on the house by cleaning it. 
He keeps wanting a system in the house to help organize the kids toys bouncer swing ext. I make one and he said he don‚Äôt like it so he don‚Äôt follow it. He comes home from work and throws stuff everywhere (like there‚Äôs a trail down to laundry room to bedroom to bathroom) so I pick up after him to. Also I wake up early (530) to make sure he has coffee and his lunch and breakfast for work. 
My baby still wakes up through out the night to nurse so I don‚Äôt get much sleep. 3 yr old goes down at 7-730 and is up at 530 with everyone nap is 11-1230ish and baby is up and down every day/night so I normally go to bed around 10 but have to get up around 1130-12 nurse rock baby change diaper ext that takes anywhere from 30 min to an hour. then wake around 230 to nurse and again at 5. I think I only get roughly 4-5 hrs a night. 

We went grocery shopping recently as a whole family ( I normally order for pickup ) we were arguing the whole time and I didn‚Äôt get 1/4 of the stuff on the list. He told me that the kids looked disheveled and so did I. And how I don‚Äôt look put together and how I should have put makeup on.
Our 3 yr old has super curly hair and doesn‚Äôt sit still very long for me to do it so 3 yr old just had a ponytail in.

Sorry this is kind of a long post and wrote it on mobile sorry for any formatting or punctuation issues.
So back about a few months ago I 28m asked this girl 30f out. We had been talking for months and I go into her work on almost a daily basis. And would end up having lunch together ( not at her work) on occasion . After we had a long talk when we were hanging out the one day I told her that I liked her and wanted to take her on a date, and gave her my number 

I made sure not to do it while she was at work, because that just seems like a bad idea all around and just not fair to the person. (she works at this little cafe that's literally across the street from my house and they have the best Philly sandwiches and coffee I've had in my city honestly fucking amazing)

 she asked for my number as we had been talking primarily through snapchat she asked for mine first 

 we agreed to go out that weekend. The day of the date shows up and I'm at the restaurant and she never shows I texted her to tell her I'm heading home. she messages me and apologies for not coming that she's currently at the hospital with her grandma who's sick. Obviously I understood and told her I'd give her some space. Not even 10 minutes later I see her story on snap that she's at some club with some friends drinking and partying. I chose not to say anything because what the hell. I go to sleep and wake up to a text from her friend  saying that the girl I asked out wasn't actually interested and gave out my number to her friend. I told her sorry that I'm not interested and felt pretty bothered and a bit creeped out about the whole situation now both of them are calling me an asshole (among many other things)  

Am I an asshole? Go clarify a few things the age difference on the other woman was a no from me as I am 28 and the other woman was in her late 40's and I just wasn't interested and I've been getting berated for it getting told things like ""guys like you shouldn't be choosey and other kinds of things.

### Training
More of a casual approach to the race than typical for me. I probably averaged around 45-50 per week, with a 50k event 3 weeks prior to the start. Peak week was around 60 miles. I have been trying to focus more on lower mileage (for me), but adding in 1-2 quality sessions per week.

### Pre-race
My wife and I ended up finding an AirBnB about 30 minutes away from the start, which worked out well. We drove up the day before and I had a decent night of sleep. I had back to back work trips in the 2 weeks leading up, so that was not ideal. Woke up at 3:40AM, had a bagel and coffee/water, got ready and parked around 5:15. Bib pickup was easy and efficient like all of KH Races events. It was surprisingly warm for that early in the morning during winter - around 67 degrees (F) at that time.

### Race
Started off in the dark and immediately went into a solid 1,000ft climb. Absolutely gorgeous watching the sun rise over the ocean - crystal clear skies. Once past the ocean we had a great view of the mountains, which again we got to see the sun rise over. 

Hit the first Aid Station, Hell Hill, at mile 4.8. This was the first of 3 total times we would visit this one - with unique loops for the other 2.

Left the aid station and headed out into some beautiful meadows on nice soft singletrack. This loop brought us back around to another climb that peaked with yet another sweeping view of the coastline + islands - absolutely stunning. Trails were filled with a lot of people outside of the race just enjoying the beautiful weather.

It was a pretty hot day out - with temps forecast to be 76 (F) and a lot of exposure to the sun. Everything was going pretty well and I got to the mile 23 aid station in great shape. I had brought an extra handheld for this next section as we were warned to bring extra water for it. This section runs ~9.5 miles and has 2,600 ft. of climbing, all of which is pretty remote. They were very upfront that you can choose to drop to the 50k if you are not feeling well at this point. I completed this section relatively unscathed, although I almost fell at one point and ended up feeling something in my ribcage pop as I shifted to keep myself upright.

After leaving the mile 33 aid station, the next section was 12 miles. My rib started to feel increasingly painful. I zoned out for a bit, and missed a clearly marked u-turn to stay on course. Instead I went off-course for about 15 minutes - one I realized it, I doubled back. Luckily, only half an hour lost. At mile 35 I was feeling confident that the climbing was over and put my poles away. Shortly after, I took a nice tumble on some soft jagged rock. Got some sweet cuts, picked myself up, and kept moving. I had to manage water during this section since the extra half hour off course really put me in a tight spot during an already long section. Kept moving, saw a herd of ~10 deer, and managed to get to the next aid station at mile 45.

The 5 mile section begins with a solid climb of ~1,000 ft. before dropping back into the canyon for a nice downhill finish on single track. The sunset was absolutely beautiful. I crossed the finish line right after 6pm.

### Post-race
Got first aid at the finish line, picked up my medal, and headed back to the airbnb as my rib was not in a fun place. The rest of my body was completely fine and felt good to go a fair bit longer. Recovery has been pretty smooth, the rib is improving slowly, but still painful enough that I cannot sleep on that side. I have resumed running, which has not irritated it. Overall - the race was absolutely stunning, well organized, and a ton of fun!

I'm starting to think my (F30) bf (60m) is kind of a loser.,"My bf whom I have looked up to for the last few years has been sick for the first time in our relationship. 

While he has been sick he has been going to the couch to sleep in the middle of the night and hasn't been to work all week. I initially felt bad for the guy and I have been taking care of him all week. I have to work during the day but I have been cooking for him, giving him medicine, providing him with anything that would make him feel good and when I get home I just leave him completely alone as he seems overly sensitive to everything I have been doing especially the last two days. (ex: he was upset that I went tot he room after getting home and putting the groceries away. When I came down two hours later to make dinner he was super fussy asking where I was and saying ""fine. I won't talk to you tonight"" and then acting like he didn't say that an hour later. This is all extremely out of character) Anyway, I'm now sick and our dog is sick too after introducing a new food that didn't sit well. This morning I was late to work because I was making him tea, cleaning up after the dog, and preparing snacks for him so he could stay on the couch. 

Now to the part where I think he is kind of a loser:

My bf has been eating pasta, cakes, and cookies the entire time he has been home. Has gone for walks at 4 in the morning in 20 degree temperature (we are in the middle of farm land it is dark and freezing out) and is not doing anything to make himself feel better. I got home last night to find him chowing down pringles while watching 2 and a half men and saw all the cookies in the house were eaten. Initially I thought it was good he was eating something but his throat is so hoarse he can barely talk. He REFUSES to take a COVID test even though he literally has about 15 boxes in his house at his disposal. 

I then saw his phone this morning when I went to put his food on the coffee table and saw him sending all of his guy friends some porn boob Christmas calendar and his friends were sending each other horrible misogynistic memes over taping their wives mouths and saying ""this is how you quiet a dishwasher"" with my bf saving it and sending it elsewhere. 

This morning I sat next to him to have my morning smoothie with him before heading into the office and while chatting I asked him why he hasn't taken a covid test because he has so many it would be worth knowing and this guy snapped at me YELLING ""Fine. If you want me to take one so badly then I'll do it"". I mentioned this once on Sunday and he said no to which I dropped it until his throat has gotten significantly worse. I got up and said ""You don't have to be a dick. Have a good day"" and walked away. He was calling me to come back but I just don't care.

This man is 30 years my senior and doesn't know how to take care of himself? It is really turning me off.

Am I overreacting by this or should I be understanding since he isn't feeling well. I don't want to be unrealistic but I also don't want to accept being treated poorly. ever. ",0,1734713806.0,AmIOverreacting,10,0.5,False

In general, I feel like I have just been really stuck for quite some time and I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overthinking myself into misery. 

The life context:
Grew up in the suburbs, didnt have a lot but more than most, was an artsy kid who was really involved in music and theater, I started working at 13 at my uncles seafood restaurant and have always had some form of a job since then. 

I had always wanted to go to school for music, got into a great music school but couldn‚Äôt afford it so I went to a state school because of pressure from my parents. My first semester at school, my dad was diagnosed with and passed away from stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I got really depressed, started failing classes, then my uncle passed away, then Covid happened, and then I personally went through my own health battle dealing with an autoimmune disease. I was a mess had to drop out in my 3rd year and only having completed about a years worth of classes. 

Luckily at the time, I was working basically full time for a start up company that was related to restaurant work and real estate as an operations lead. This job ended up being a nightmare and I quit, bartended for a while until I found my current company, an innovation space in a (fairly) thriving life sciences market. 

Here I‚Äôve worked on their Community operations team in progressively more responsible roles. To explain what I do I usually tell people ‚Äúim kind of like an office manager, property manager, event coordinator, and customer service rep‚Äù. 

My day usually starts by checking the common area kitchens, I then lead my teams daily morning meeting, next is some project work relating to customer experience, then lunch, then I go clean some more, and then do data/project work for the sales team. I oversee a ticketing system that receives almost 400 tickets month and handle a lot of our project tracking and workflows. 

I‚Äôm just feeling so miserable here. Overall my job is great but I took this job when I was 22 and needed the money. I‚Äôve found myself in this precarious situation of feeling like im not experienced enough to land a job above my 67k/yr salary but find myself meeting the qualifications for a lot of roles I‚Äôve seen posted in the last year. 

I just feel like the work im doing is so unimportant and im just always broke. I had to take this job because I needed the money and was hoping the experience would lead to something new. But I‚Äôve just been stuck here. 

I‚Äôve tried to do some professional development by going down the property manager path and received the accredited commercial manager certification through the institute of real estate management to try and make my experience seem more focused. However, despite multiple rounds of interviews at a few companies, nothing has landed. 

I feel like I‚Äôd be so great for some type of customer experience strategy type role or an operations manager role. I‚Äôm just struggling to really get my story across in my resume and cover letter at times. 

I also feel like my lack of education is really holding me back but I‚Äôm not sure how I can fix that. I basically failed out of college and amassed an insane amount of debt doing so. I can‚Äôt take loans to finish my degree and I can‚Äôt take a step back from work because I have private loans on a modified plan that cannot be deferred. Im thinking of getting real estate license next but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs even worth it. 

Im not a sales person- im a people person. Being a people person had led me into a sales type role and I just don‚Äôt feel super great about it. I‚Äôm also just losing my mind because it feels insane that im doing revenue projections in the millions of dollars one hour and then im worried about emptying a coffee machine and putting out fruit the next.

I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I know im better than where I am right now. I just don‚Äôt know what my next step is because I feel like I‚Äôve been trying to push forward with no success. 

Any help or guidance is really appreciated thanks for taking the time to read my story. 

Best,
Wing lover

Starbucks baristas are going on five days of escalating ULP strikes in response to the company backtracking on our promised path forward, starting in these three cities. Over these five days, hundreds of stores will join... THIS WILL BE SWU'S BIGGEST STRIKE YET

Since February, Starbucks has repeatedly pledged publicly that they intended to reach contracts by the end of the year - but they've yet to present workers with a serious economic proposal. This week, less than two weeks before their end-of-year deadline, Starbucks proposed no immediate wage increase for union baristas, and a guarantee of only 1.5% wage increases in future years.

Our unfair labor practice (ULP) strikes will begin Friday morning and escalate each day through Christmas Eve... unless Starbucks honors our commitment to work towards a foundational framework.

1hio0al,https://www.reddit.com/r/SheerTerror/comments/1hio0al/unfiltered_pt_1/,Unfiltered pt 1. ,"\- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always believed that the human brain is the most complicated map in existence. Every thought, every emotion, everything is woven in such an intricate, delicate way. And yet, it‚Äôs all controlled by something that, for some reason, we think we understand, but we don‚Äôt. What happens when the brain starts to fail? Or worse, what happens when someone, of their own free will, starts to ignore the signals? The red lights that the brain should turn on, but never does. Those are the minds that interest me. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Because what I discovered, what I‚Äôm about to reveal, will change everything we know about human behavior.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúAt first, I thought there was a simple explanation for what I was looking for. A few miswired neurons, a bit of faulty genetics‚Ä¶ But the truth is much darker than that. When the mind cracks, when psychopathy and crime emerge from the shadows, the answers are more complicated than one might imagine. But still, I can‚Äôt stop looking. Because when it comes to the human mind, there‚Äôs something very seductive about unraveling what‚Äôs beyond the visible.‚Äù

Martina‚Äôs voice is clear, but there‚Äôs something in her tone that can‚Äôt be easily identified. A subtle shudder in her words, as if she were talking about something that has her trapped, even though she can‚Äôt help it. There‚Äôs an obsession, not just scientific, but personal.

\- ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. My name is Martina. I‚Äôm a neuroscientist, although I don‚Äôt usually call myself that too much. My coworkers call me ‚Äòthe weird one‚Äô because of my approach. Nobody understands why, sometimes, I spend entire days researching human behavior and its darkest disorders. I‚Äôm the one who always looks for patterns in broken minds, those that fall between the margins of normality. People sometimes look at me as if I‚Äôm dangerous. And no, I‚Äôm not talking about those crazy people in horror movies. I'm talking about those cases that psychiatrists dismiss as 'anomalies', as 'complex minds'. These are the people who really intrigue me. Those, the ones who never fit in, the ones everyone avoids. The ones who, in the end, make the difference.‚Äù

Martina reflects in silence while the soft sound of a coffee machine in the background resonates in the room. The noises are constant, but the feeling that the scene generates is one of isolation. Martina is alone in her thoughts, immersed in something much bigger than herself. This is where her story begins.

\- ‚ÄúOver the years, I have worked with many experts, but I can't say that they have all understood the 'why' of this research. Although, of course, I don't care too much what they think. Dr. Avery, for example... I would never understand him. He's a brilliant guy, sure, but sometimes his methods... his ways so... cold... almost calculating, make my hair stand on end. He's British, which probably explains his distance. She always has a distant look, as if she were looking at something through a fog that no one else can see. But what bothers me is her silence.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúThen there is Sofia. She is completely different, her mindset... she is more open, warmer. She will never admit it, but she has become fond of the team, of the people. Even though she feels like a fish out of water, she always has something to say, something to add to the analysis, something to question what we think we know about human beings and their relationships with nature. People like Sofia, who observe ecosystems, the connections between animals and human behavior, are disconcerting to me. But not in a bad way. It gives me hope in a way. Even though she never tells me, I know that she is as caught up in this mystery as I am. She, like me, is looking for answers.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúBut, of course, not all the team shares my enthusiasm. Some are only here because they are interested in the money or the prestige that comes with the project.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúI can't tell you everything now. It's not the time. But when this investigation comes to an end, when everything falls apart... you will understand what we discovered. And what we did, what I did to stop him.‚Äù

The laboratory is silent, the distant hum of computers blending with the whisper of leaves tapping against the windows in the gentle breeze. It‚Äôs early morning, but the tension in the air is already palpable. I sit at a desk covered with papers: studies on bee behavior, charts on their communication through pheromones, and detailed observations of movements within the hives. The images of the bees are vivid in my mind‚Äîtheir flight in perfect harmony, like a clock in motion. But today, I can‚Äôt focus on that. I sense Sofia‚Äôs presence behind me before hearing her voice.

\- ""How‚Äôs the data from Hive 3 coming along?"" she asks in her usually upbeat tone, though there‚Äôs something in her voice that makes me think she‚Äôs uneasy too.

\- ""I don‚Äôt know,"" I reply, running a hand through my hair. ""The behavior in Hive 3 seems off. They‚Äôre more agitated than usual. It‚Äôs like something is disturbing them.""

Sofia steps closer, looking at the data on my screen. Her eyes scan the graphs and notes I‚Äôve been taking, then meet mine with a mix of uncertainty and concern.

\- ""Do you think something might be interfering with their pheromones?"" she suggests. ""Maybe there‚Äôs an external factor we‚Äôre overlooking.""

\- ""That‚Äôs what I think. Their flight patterns are erratic, and not just in one hive, but in several. It could be something in the environment, or maybe... something else,"" I say, my voice faltering despite trying to sound confident.

Sofia raises an eyebrow, unsure of exactly what I mean. Before she can ask, Dr. Avery walks into the room. Always so formal, so meticulous, each step calculated as if measuring his presence.

\- ""What do we have here, ladies?"" His tone is curt but not entirely rude. To be fair, he always carries an air of being on a mission he doesn‚Äôt fully understand. ""Any progress with the bees?""

Sofia responds quickly, as she always does, trying to avoid any potential conflict.

\- ""We‚Äôre observing some strange patterns. Over the past few weeks, the bees in several hives have shown signs of disturbance. We‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs causing it.""

Dr. Avery approaches, glances at the data on my screen, and after a moment of silence, nods dismissively.

\- ""And what do you propose to do about it?"" His tone suggests he‚Äôs less concerned about the bees than we are. He‚Äôs focused on progress, on results‚Äînot details that can‚Äôt be controlled.

\- ""We wanted to run a series of tests, maybe expose them to different controlled environments to see how they react, but..."" Sofia hesitates, glancing at the other team members who have started entering the room. ""What if it‚Äôs something else? Something out of the ordinary?""

Sofia‚Äôs words hang in the air, heavier than I expected. Dr. Avery looks at her with a blank expression, as though he doesn‚Äôt grasp her implication.

\- ""What I‚Äôm interested in, ladies,"" Dr. Avery begins, interrupting whatever Sofia was about to say, ""is getting concrete results. This isn‚Äôt about theories. If something is interfering with the bees, we need to know what it is, period. We don‚Äôt have time for... speculations.""

The tension is palpable. It‚Äôs rare to see Dr. Avery this involved in a conversation that isn‚Äôt directly about outcomes.

\- ""I know,"" I say, feeling my mind racing, though something feels wrong‚Äîsomething I can‚Äôt quite articulate. ""But I think we‚Äôre facing something that could be more... more than just an environmental issue.""

Sofia shoots me a quick glance. She feels it too. Sometimes, words aren‚Äôt necessary to understand what the other is thinking. At that moment, the team gathers around the table, and Dr. Avery shifts the discussion to a formal meeting about progress and next steps. The topic slips away; here, all they want is... results.

It‚Äôs late. The laboratory is almost empty, the sound of the keyboard and the faint hum of the coffee machine breaking the silence. The clock on the wall reads 9:15 PM. At this hour, I‚Äôm usually in my office, surrounded by books and papers, preparing for the class I need to teach on free will. But tonight, I can‚Äôt focus. My mind is trapped in a whirlwind of thoughts that don‚Äôt seem to fit together.

I‚Äôm reviewing studies on the human brain, recent research on decision-making, and the surprising conclusions of neuroscientists. Something lingers in my mind, but I can‚Äôt process it. I open another article‚Äîa study discussing how the human brain makes decisions even before we, as individuals, are aware of them, precisely 550 milliseconds before we realize it.¬†*It‚Äôs as if we‚Äôre puppets of the brain,*¬†I think, rereading the words.

I remember when I first learned about Benjamin Libet‚Äôs experiments. In those studies, participants thought they were making decisions in real time, but in reality, their brains had already activated the necessary areas to carry out the decision seconds before they became aware of it. In other words, our brain seems to take control before we can even say, ‚ÄúI decided.‚Äù Does that mean we‚Äôre entirely subject to a destiny we can‚Äôt control?

My thoughts drift to something more unsettling. If our brain makes decisions without our consent, could that explain criminal behavior? Could the lack of control justify atrocious acts? Perhaps criminals, murderers, aren‚Äôt entirely responsible for what they do if the brain makes the decisions for them. But I can‚Äôt help but question: is it really that simple?

I can‚Äôt stop reading‚Äîpage after page. The information about the brain areas involved in criminal behavior pulls me in, another piece of the puzzle forming in my mind. The amygdala, that small almond-shaped structure, is responsible for emotion, fear, anger, and reward processing. The prefrontal cortex, located at the front of the brain, is associated with rational decision-making, impulse control, and morality. It‚Äôs as if the battle between emotion and reason plays out inside our brains.

But something holds me back. Something doesn‚Äôt fit. Something beyond the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. The thalamus. This ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù that connects sensory information to the brain, integrating what we perceive from the outside world. It‚Äôs the processing center of our reality. What if dysregulation in the thalamus has something to do with criminal behavior? It‚Äôs an idea that flashes in my mind suddenly, like a light in the darkness. If the thalamus isn‚Äôt properly managing sensory information, if it‚Äôs sending incorrect signals to the brain, could that influence how we perceive the world? Could it lead to violence, impulsivity, a lack of empathy?

My heart beats faster, as if a switch has flipped in my mind. I stare at the computer screen for a moment, frozen. The hypothesis slowly takes shape, a sketch of a theory that could change everything.¬†*This needs to be explored,*¬†I think. But I don‚Äôt have much time‚Äîmy class on free will starts in a few hours. I quickly review my notes for the lecture, but now the words feel empty, as if they no longer matter. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this hypothesis. I need to research more, and I need to share it with someone who can help me understand if it holds any weight.

I open my office door and head down the hallway to the laboratory where Sofia usually works. I find her reviewing some charts on bee behavior.

\- ""Sofia,"" I call her urgently, my voice trembling with excitement. ""I have a new hypothesis. About criminal behavior... I think there‚Äôs something more. Something in the brain we haven‚Äôt considered.""

Sofia turns to me, startled by my tone.

\- ""What‚Äôs going on, Martina? Have you discovered something? Wait‚Äîour project is about bees. Why are you developing hypotheses about humans and... murderers?""

\- ""It‚Äôs the thalamus. I‚Äôve been reading about free will and criminal behavior, and I think the thalamus might be involved. If it doesn‚Äôt properly regulate sensory information, we could be seeing a distortion of reality‚Äîone that could justify certain impulsive or even criminal behaviors.""

Sofia stares at me in silence for a moment. Her expression grows thoughtful, as if she‚Äôs weighing what I just said.

\- ""That sounds... interesting, but it‚Äôs also a pretty risky hypothesis, isn‚Äôt it?"" she replies, rubbing her chin as she thinks. ""Are you sure there‚Äôs something about the thalamus that could influence that kind of behavior?""

\- ""I‚Äôm not sure, but it‚Äôs something I want to explore. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that criminal behavior is often linked to alterations in brain areas like the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. If everything is connected, maybe the thalamus is the missing link.""

Sofia nods slowly, as if considering the possibility.

\- ""Alright, Martina. But we should discuss this with the team. This could change the course of our research. If we‚Äôre willing to go down this path, we need stronger evidence.""

Anxiety consumes me. I know I‚Äôve made a decision, but I also feel the weight of what it implies. Could this be what finally leads us to discover something big?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The tension in the air is palpable as I stand in front of the meeting room mirror, adjusting my hair and mentally reviewing the notes for what I‚Äôm about to say. Sofia is next to me, just as nervous, though she appears calmer. She doesn‚Äôt know how the research group will react to my hypothesis‚Äîand neither do I.

\- ‚ÄúAre you sure this is what you want to do?‚Äù Sofia asks, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.

\- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have another choice. If I don‚Äôt do it now, I never will. But... I need your help to make my hypothesis make sense,‚Äù I reply, feeling my words catch in my throat. ‚ÄúI promise it‚Äôll all come together. After the meeting, we‚Äôll find the answers we need.‚Äù

Sofia gives me a slight nod, though her expression is full of uncertainty. As for me, I‚Äôm determined but also feel a knot in my stomach. What if they don‚Äôt believe me? What if all this is just an illusion I‚Äôve created in my head? The door opens, and Avery, the group director, walks in. His presence, always imposing, fills the room. He‚Äôs a tall man with short hair and thick-rimmed glasses. He has a way of looking at people that makes you feel like you‚Äôre constantly being analyzed.

\- ‚ÄúMartina,‚Äù he says with a slight smile, observing my nervousness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready for the meeting. Remember, we‚Äôre here to discuss the project results. I want to know what factor explains the erratic behavior of the bees.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúYes, Avery,‚Äù I respond, trying to make my voice sound steady. ‚ÄúBut before we dive into the details of bee behavior, I want to talk about something else. Something that‚Äôs been on my mind.‚Äù

He frowns slightly, intrigued, but nods.

\- ‚ÄúMake it quick, Martina. We‚Äôre short on time. If you‚Äôve got something to say, now‚Äôs the moment.‚Äù

Sofia looks at me, as if urging me to get to the point, and I take a deep breath, glancing at the research group already gathered around the table. There‚Äôs a murmur of conversations and a few nervous laughs, but the room quickly quiets as everyone notices I‚Äôm standing. With one hand gripping my notes, I begin to speak.

\- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about something that could change the course of our research. For weeks, we‚Äôve been focused on bee behavior and how their action patterns have started to deviate from the expected. But what‚Äôs been on my mind isn‚Äôt just about the bees‚Ä¶ what I want to investigate now is human behavior. Specifically, criminal behavior.‚Äù

At these words, the room falls silent. My colleagues‚Äô faces light up with expressions of confusion, curiosity, and, in some cases, skepticism. At the back of the room, Avery adjusts his glasses and watches me intently.

\- ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, Martina?‚Äù Avery asks, his voice betraying his surprise. ‚ÄúAre you suggesting that criminal behavior has something to do with what we‚Äôre studying about the bees?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúNo, not exactly,‚Äù I respond, my voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm suggesting is that human behavior, particularly criminal behavior, could be influenced by dysfunction in the brain areas that control our perception of the world. Specifically, I‚Äôm talking about the thalamus.‚Äù

I see some team members exchange glances, their eyes full of doubt. Others start jotting down notes. I feel slightly more at ease, knowing at least they‚Äôre paying attention.

\- ‚ÄúMartina,‚Äù Javier, one of the researchers, interjects. He‚Äôs a tall man with curly hair and glasses. ‚ÄúAre you saying that the behavior of murderers can be explained by malfunctions in the thalamus? That people who commit crimes have no control over their actions?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù I quickly reply, searching for the right words. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is that if the thalamus, which regulates the integration of sensory information, isn‚Äôt functioning properly, we could be seeing a distortion of reality. This could explain impulsivity, a lack of empathy, and, in extreme cases, criminal behavior. This is something I want to explore further. The bees might be a clue, but this is much bigger.‚Äù

Avery leans back in his chair, thoughtful. His gaze shifts from me to the rest of the group.

\- ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre asking me to shift the project‚Äôs focus to something we haven‚Äôt even tested yet? A hypothesis that might be completely wrong?‚Äù

My heart races, but I take a deep breath before answering.

\- ‚ÄúYes, Avery. But I also think it‚Äôs a unique opportunity. If we can prove that this type of brain dysfunction is behind criminal behavior, we could gain a new understanding of psychopathy, criminality, and justice.‚Äù

The silence in the room stretches as my words sink in. Finally, Avery leans forward, his eyes fixed on me. Everyone waits for his response.

\- ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he says after a moment of reflection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll allow you to pursue this line of investigation. But I want you to have a clear plan. If we‚Äôre going to make this shift, we need an experimental design and results quickly. We can‚Äôt afford to waste time.‚Äù

I feel a wave of relief, though the nerves remain. Avery hasn‚Äôt said a full ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but he‚Äôs agreed to explore the possibility. That‚Äôs all I needed.

\- ‚ÄúThank you, Avery. You won‚Äôt regret it,‚Äù I say, feeling adrenaline course through my veins.

Days later, Sofia and I are in the lab, staring at the whiteboard covered in diagrams and data about the mice we‚Äôll use for the experiment. Lab animals are perfect for this: small, manageable, and with a nervous system similar enough to humans to extrapolate results. My hypothesis is starting to take shape.

\- ‚ÄúAre you sure we want to do this, Martina?‚Äù Sofia asks as she jots down some notes. ‚ÄúWhat if something goes wrong?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have another choice. This is our chance to prove something revolutionary,‚Äù I reply, looking at the experiment‚Äôs blueprint I‚Äôve designed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to test how thalamus dysfunction affects the mice‚Äôs behavior. And if we succeed, this could change everything we know about human behavior.‚Äù

Sofia smiles, though I know she shares my doubts. But she also feels the excitement of the research‚Äîand I don‚Äôt blame her. Because from now on, the project will be entirely different.",1,1734713395.0,SheerTerror,0,1.0,False

For my three local friends, who are all part of the same group, I‚Äôm trying to decide the best way to ask; individually over coffee, via our group chat or a casual girl's night/brunch at home with a small gift and handwritten note?

In this chapter's cover story, Hold'em gets a hold of Tama after beating Speed with the help of his SMILE-lion Kamijir≈ç (I think that was the name, but I'm going with my memory here, it might be wrong) and its fire-breathing capabilities and uses the girl as hostage to extort Yamato for her belongings.

Who? Who would have thought a couple of chapters ago that the cover story would turn out as the most interesting plotline of the arc??

The pattern continues and as Yamato reaches her next checkpoint, she finds some trouble. Now she only needs to meet another member of the 9 red scabbards before leaving to her next destination.

I find this part of the cover story hillarious for a lot of reasons. But before discussing them, there's something the appearance of Hold'em brings to the table and shouldn't be avoided: What happened with the Beast pirates after Kaid≈ç's defeat?

It was never told. Usually at the end of such an arc (Nation-wide power struggle the Mugiwara pirates help settle for one side or another. The most common kind of arc, I believe), there's a ""clean up"" step in the country and the losing faction is taken care of.

* Crocodile and his officers arrested by Marines.
* Eneru departs for the Moon and his priests are set to ""cloud drift"".
* Hody and his comrades are put in jail.
* Doflamingo and his crew also arrested by Marines.

But the Beast pirates were completely forgotten by the narrative and because of that, now that one of them comes back to the story, how should we interpret it?

1. Are the surviving Beast pirates (whoever they are) regrouping in Wano, getting ready to cause more trouble now that its saviors are gone because despite all the hatred, Wano's new ruling class left them completely unchecked???
2. Is Hold'em acting on his own as a lone escapee to the new Wano authority that dealt with all other Beast pirates appropriately even though we weren't told??

We can't know, but for now, I'll just assume it's option 2, because option 1 would be... Actually, option 1 would fit perfectly in the kind of writing One Piece has been getting this past decade, but I still refuse to lose hope.

Any way, by the looks of it, Speed was one-hit-KO'd not putting up a fight at all. Who let her join the Beast pirates and promoted her to Shin'uchi?? She's useless.

""No, Katakuri, don't be so harsh with poor Speed. She was surely ambushed by Hold'em.""

Well, the fact that Tama is not hurt indicates Hold'em took Tama before roasting Speed. So, her defeat can't be blamed on the surprise element. But even if she actually had been ambushed, then what good is her 350¬∫-wide panoramic vision she used to boast about if she's not going to notice being ambushed??

And what was Yamato doing exactly during all that? I mean, look at ther. She looks helpless! WTH?? She was strong and resolute during the Wano arc. Why is she panicking now as Chopper in front of any unexpected event??

And what about Hold'em? Every other outlaw in Wano took the smart decision not to confront Yamato. Let's be real. She's in all likeliness the strongest individual in the whole country right now and very well-known by everyone in it. And yet Hold'em decided to pick a fight with her.

Even in the case he ambushed Speed, he still ambushed Speed rather than Yamato. Why??? But that isn't everything. He's asking for their belongings, as though they would carry much of worth. We don't know whether he's trying to find an escape out of Wano or has adopted the life of a bandit there, but in any case, what is he expecting to steal from Yamato??

Hold'em, better than anyone, should know he already has the most valuable good in his hands. He had already kidnapped Tama once in order to use her to tame animals. Why is he using Tama as a hostage now and not as the thing to grab and run??

Everything is so silly here and then there's also Komachiyo's disappearance. He is not in the picture now. Conveniently erased from the action. But I found an explanation to all of this. Don't get your hopes up, it's not a good explanation as the scene won't make any more sense, but it's an explanation nonetheless:

With this cover, Oda wanted to make a homage to the Wizard of Oz. So, in the picture there are the four protagonists of the story:

* Speed represents the cowardly lion. We know she withstood Kaid≈ç's attack before and still had strength to run back to Bakura for plot convenience. But now, she's frozen in the ground unable to help Tama. She needs courage just like the cowardly lion.
* Hold'em represents the scarecrow. He should know way better, and yet he's making every wrong decision he can (in a single panel). As the scarecrow, a brain would do well to him.
* Yamato represents the tin man. She's just there doing literally nothing. It''s her friends and companions, who went on a quest to help her, who have been attacked and yet Yamato can't find an ounce of empathy within her to help them back. She clearly needs a heart that lets her have feelings just as the tin man.
* Finally, Tama represents Dorothy. She's been literally and figuratively taken away from her homeland (Kuri to Udon) by riding in Speed's back, being involved in Yamato's adventure and held hostage by Hold'em, and needs to find the way back. Just like Dorothy who was taken from Kansas to Munchkinland by a tornado.

The chapter starts with these three pages that are basically a repeated flashback. Save for Spandine talking to the journalists and Robin drawing Ohara in the map, two things that are completely irrelevant for the story, everything in the flashback we already knew.

Robin had it very rough in her childhood because the government demonized her and offered good money for her head. She could never rest or feel safe and everyone turned on her to earn her bounty. Not a single new relevant detail.

If a couple of chapters back we had a panel to remind us of who Hajrudin is, then now we got three whole pages to let us know who one of the protagonists is, because obviously we don't know the protagonists of the story.

Any way, let's talk about those two things.Why is Spandine reporting to the journalists? Telling them a sob story. I mean, How bad in the head should the whole world be if they read on the newspapers ""Marines raze a whole island to the ground because there were some criminals living there and an 8-year-old criminal sinks the evacuation ship for the people who just lost it all in the Marines' bombing"" and their concern is with the 8-year-old criminal???

Spandine isn't blaming Robin for what happened to Ohara. He's admitting a Buster Call was conducted in the island. He's blaming Robin for the sunken ships alone. It's ridiculous.

But even more ridiculous than that it's the fact that of all people, Spandine is the one speaking to journalists. Who is he identifying as???

World Economic Journal:

>""Director Spandine, head of the supersecret government agency of elite spies and assassins, now not-so-secret-anymore and not-known-until-now as Cipher Pol 9, reported that a child by the name of Nico Robin escaped them during the Buster Call that leveled the island of Ohara.""

He's supposed to remain unknown and specially not related with the World Government in any way. What is this joke?

Also, why would the island itself be removed from maps?? What's the point? The island still exists, it's just the settlement that doesn't. I'm sure merchants and anyone sailing a ship would like to know there's an island there so that they don't stumble upon it, think they reached somewhere else and start doubting their course and conequently sailing based on false information messing their whole travel.

What about all the maps of West Blue that already existed? They they go house by house throughout the world taking them?

What's the problem with people knowing there is an island there? It's not like they've put a secret laboratory like in Punk Hazard or Egghead, it's just a deserted island now, so why?? The only thing they're accomplishing with that is creating a perfect haven for pirates to hide in a place the world think doesn't exist.

Furthermore, didn't Spandine just report to the news about the whole incident in Ohara??? Who's in charge of the strategy?? Is it Sengoku? Is it a gorosei?? Either tell the world about Ohara, or make them believe it doesn't exist, but you can't go both ways! XD

Summarizing: Inside a repeated flashback that brings no relevant information, there's still two new things that would be nothing but an embelishment that make no sense by themselves and even less when combined.

[Ch. 1133 p5](https://preview.redd.it/l9oxq10j818e1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d69c3f9f5cf4eee666baf5d985e9e567e2743d9)

""The island is massive!"" sure. Just look at the rainbow's width arriving at the port and also in the same picture with the whole island.

The Great Erik arrives at a small dock, ""Western village port"", and lies on sea clouds, ""of course"". Some giants are there to greet them while worried by their lateness.

The name of the port confuses me a bit. I don't think it means ""the port of the Western village"" because the other Mugiwara pirates are there too and they were at Elbaf village not a different one named ""Western"". But then it should mean ""the one port in the village that's to the west"", implying that there is more than one port: one to the west and at least one other somewhere else. But why would a small village located on the tree-tops need more than one port? A single port is already quite a stretch, if you ask me. Especially considering how during the previous arc, the Giant warrior pirates along with Shanks were hanging out at the ""land of the dead"". Why didn't they invite Shanks' crew over to their village if they're good friends? What would have they done had they needed to set sail immediately? Hike the mountains across the whole island, climb the tree and get to the port at the edge of the tree-tops to get to their ship?

Anyway, I don't know who wrote that ""of course"", Oda or the translator, but whoever it was... It makes no sense. It couldn't possibly be obvious under no circumstance that there would be sea clouds between the branches and leaves of the Adam tree. Those are only supposed to be so up in the sky not there. Also, we can see mountain-wide waterfalls coming out of the leaves. Actual water, not sea clouds. If anything, actual rivers should be expected up there and not sea clouds.

I get why those giants were worried by the pirates' lateness. It took them a really short time to go from Elbaf to Egghead (they read newspapers about Luffy as soon as morning, got to Egghead during the same daytime and left and partied before dusk. However the way back took them more than 2 full days. They were truly late. For no logical reason. However, wouldn't it be more reasonable to wait for them at the shores of the island where they'd be able to see them coming? For all they know, the pirates could have been partying at the bar at the shore for two days. So, either they weren't that much worried or they're very dumb.

[Ch. 1133 p6\_7](https://preview.redd.it/wgdahhdl818e1.png?width=2203&format=png&auto=webp&s=9052a3eb3d85d860943ca3bb708313b6a3f8876a)

More panels of Mugiwara pirates amazed at everything they see. Gerd and Goldberg fly on a small boat that floats because it has island clouds at the tip of the rows. They land at the port and meet with Hajrudin, Stansen and Rodo.

I really don't know what else to say. A flying boat. Just like that. Because it has a small line of island cloud... ¬øsomehow glued? to the oars. Imagine Pagaya's face if he could see this. A sky engineer like him and the expertise of every other engineer in Skypiea ever humiliated by some giant barbarians that don't even know what the rainbows in their homeland are. Years of designing and building by Eneru and a lot of workers to make a ship that could fly powered by Eneru's electricity and hundreds of dials, when all they needed to do was put some island cloud on a stick. Easy peasy. How did that never occurred to them?

There's one good thing to this flying boat, though.

https://preview.redd.it/negvcr7n818e1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=66e60e8514108ac689d8f535238f11be538bd012

It's just a small boat and this will never surely never again be found on a big ship, but to see Oda remembers triangular sails exist after... I don't know, 20 years? When was the last time a ship had triangular sails? Arlong's ship?

And look! At the cliff, there's some kind of hidden building that goes underground. These spaces already appeared last chapter. I wonder if that's going to be explored or it's just a random detail.

And... Wait. If Goldberg has the Sunny in his hands and Gerd has the other Mugiwara pirates in hers (you can see one of her elbows bent towards her knees), who is rowing the boat?? Is there a cloud monster inside rowing those six oars for them too???

More Bonney and Lilith shoehorned page after page. This time Lilith is even used to show amzement at ""all the technology"" at Elbaf. But let me tell you one thing, Lilith, it's only TECHNology if someone developed a TECHNique to create it. Rainbows, clouds and ¬øbubbles? aren't technology just because they exist. And why is she amazed? Elbaf is the closest island to Egghead. Didn't Vegapunk know about his neighbours?? By the way, where are the bubbles Lilith speaks about? Don't tell me she's amazed at something she already knew from before??

And then there's that guy in the bottom right panel shouting ""The climate here is perfect for all this!!"" He's like super thrilled as well. WTF?? You live there. You see that every day. Why are you shouting like your pop idol just came out from behind a curtain?? This is Oda doing exactly this to his own manga:

https://preview.redd.it/x391k19o818e1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ace30719e9744a532d9de27530c6ba0867c5a2d1

But the scene makes no sense at all! Last chapter Gerd had already arrived at the village with the others. Why are they now flying to the village? Or to another part of the village? Why aren't they just walking? They walked all the way from below the tree-tops, they walked all the way to the village and now they're taking a flying boat to move through the village?? Where did they take that boat from??

And look!! There's the 5 of them now! Hajrudin and Stansen who arrived by the rainbow, Gerd and Goldberg we just saw in the flying boat and... RODO!! He's here. Crucified even!! But BY WHO??? Who the hell crucified Rodo and brought him here??? He was left beaten at the forest. Goldberg couldn't bring him because he's carrying the Sunny. Gerd didn't either. He's not even at the flying boat. HOW DID HE GOT HERE?? It's nonsense!

And... I'm sorry, but I can't help it, look at Hajrudin! Please, stand up, do the same pose he's doing, with his knees and ankles bent, his torso leaning ot his back, and now tell me why would anyone stand like that?

[Ch. 1133 p8\_9](https://preview.redd.it/g5w3h88q818e1.png?width=2196&format=png&auto=webp&s=39b8bbd394dfc7745a961a72fe7076328f91e88c)

Hajrudin and Gerd tell about how Big Mom's defeat was received in Elbaf. Someone amoing Luffy, Zoro, Nami and Usopp is surprised. The whole village seems to be looking forward for a great feast, but Robin wants to go meet Saul right away and the others go with her. Gerd takes them to the school. Robin doesn't want to bother anyone, but Luffy insists and the giants are so understanding they hold up the feast.

So, why would anyone of those four be surprised about Big Mom being defeated??

We can see the big unnecessary stone gates in the top-left corner of the big panel. So they were in the village of Elbaf after all. So what's that about Gerd and Goldberg coming in with the flying ship??? Gerd was already there by foot last chapter!

Goldberg's shield is asleep for now. I wonder if it's supposed to be a homie. A present, maybe from Big Mom at some point or Mother Carmel even?

There's among the crowd a kind of cloaked shady guy at the bottom-left. But maybe she's just a regular citizen and I'm simply aching for some plot.

There's a bear too. Is it an actual animal or a statue? Difficult to know, but I guess it's just a statue. The other animals in the below level were much bigger than giants.

The narrator clarifies now, that it wasn't the Western port, it's the Western village and with this I've had ENOUGH. Look, Oda, make up your damned mind already! For most of the manga, the name ""Elbaf"" referred to a village somewhere in the New World. ""Elbaf mura"" („Ç®„É´„Éê„ÉïÊùë) in japanese to be more precise. It means exactly ""Elbaf village"" and this is the way Dorry and Brogy referred to it. At some point the word ""Elbaf"" alone, without saying village or anything else, was also used. I believe it was during Big Mom's flashback, quite recently, that the concept of ""Warland"" was introduced. To me, it looked like an epithet, you know? Like ""Little Garden, land of the giants"", ""Elbaf, Warland"" or ""land of war"", but it's okay if it already meant that ""Elbaf"" was somewhere in a place by the name of ""Warland"", a village in an island, even though that wasn't specified either.

Some chapters ago, we were told the island is named Warland while the country is named Elbaf and that's... okay I think, despite it's pretty weird to tell someone about your village rather than your country when that someone doesn't know of your country or where your village is and even more so if your country and your village share the same name. But, whatever. As long as things were consistent, I didn't complain. There's a village by the name of Elbaf inside a country by the same name in an island named Warland. Cool. But now, now, it turns out Dorry and Brogy's village is not Elbaf. It's the ""Western village"". WHY? What reason is there to create an inconsistency like this out of the blue??? Everything would have worked as fine if the name of the village had remained Elbaf. What's the point of this?? Why no editor asked him about this? ""Hey! How come the village is not called Elbaf any more? Did you forget it was the name of the village? No problem, it's normal for this to happen every now and then, let's just fix it. I know because as the editor of this manga it's my job to know this inside out and notice theese things to be there for the author if he accidentally slips"". But no.

Gerd takes the Mugiwara in the flying boat. I still don't get how that's supposed to work. It's one thing to suspend disbelief to accept there can be a house atop a colossal cloud the size of a county. And it's a completely different thing to accept a tiny thread of cloud supports a whole boat, cargo and passengers and moves them through the sky. Also, even if we take levitation for granted just because, imagine the amount of rowing that'd be needed for the boat to move a little.

You see? How much rowing is required for the boat to move depends on the rate between the boat's mass (plus cargo, passengers, whatever) and the mass of the water the oar moves. In water, the amount of water an oar can move weighs way less than the boat and so you have to row quite a bit to get some movement. If the boat moved through thick mud, a lot less rowing would be needed for the boat to move (every stroke of the oar would require much more force, though). If the boat sails through air, which is not only a lot lighter but also way more ineficcient to move with an oar, you could be rowing all day at full speed and get nothing.

In fact, it should be as difficult as trying to use the oars as a bird's wings to take off. The clouds should only be helping (and that's already a lot of credit to them) to not fall. But the lift would be entirely on you. That is not possible with a pair of oars even if it's just one person trying, imagine a whole boat! Back in Skypiea Oda knew of this and he provided with dials to act as propellers for this very reason.

On another topic, the bit about Luffy saying he has to greet Saul I think it's a call back to how Ace also wanted (and did) meet with Shanks after becoming a pirate and thanked him for having taken care of Luffy.

However, this little (or not so little, we don't know yet) detour is the most anti-climatic and mood-killer development ever. The giants of the village are all very fired-up to feast for their ""leaders"" return and suddenly they have to not have their party because some foreigners want to run some errands first. And we and them (the giants) we'll surely have to pretend later that this never happened and that we can pick up exactly were they left off now as if nothing happened. Right? So... What do you think Dorry, Broggy, Hajrudin, etc are doing now? Sitting at the tavern, with all that food getting cold but not taking a bite, looking at some magic wristwatch they might have wondering when will Luffy come back. Getting bored, reflecting about life in silence as they try to pretend time's just stopped by now, slowly realizing it's not, thinking how are they going to shout and laugh and cheer later as they eat and drink with the same enthusiasm they would have done right about now if their mood has been murdered by the author, pondering whether they'll just fake it or be honest with the Mugiwara upon their return and tell them to eat in quiet as the party's been called off because no one feels like it anymore.

You know what? Actually, I'd be a lot more interested in reading what's going on in that tavern right now than what's coming in the next pages.

[Ch. 1133 p10](https://preview.redd.it/4zmlz3wt818e1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a3e4050fbb583c5e09e64bbc5849bbde87bb1f9)

Gerd and the Mugiwara finally arrive at ""Warrior's springs"" where the Owl library is. It's a beautiful lake under a giant branch of the Adam tree with a beach made of... ¬øbark? Luffy impulsively tries to go first and meet Saul, but Nami stops him to let Robin meet with his friend first.

A page ago we were told Saul was at the library so Gerd was taking the Mugiwara to the school. It follows logically that Saul's in the school's library. Specially considering this very page Gerd explains to Usopp that giants study too. Hence the school. But then we arrive and there's no school. The building's named ""Owl library"". So, either, the library is a separate building that's not actually the school, or there's no school and giants study at the library. Or maybe they don't study anymore as of this page... Also, about the waterfall, where does all that water come from?

You know what? IT'S FINE. I don't care. There's a beach because small bits of bark are acting like sand and there are waves because the waterfall obviously creates them. And that is the most and best explained things we've had for 200 chapters, easily. So, even if some things are still lacking, when I read this I just want to cry HALLELUJAH!

None of this changes the fact the last panel of the page is one of the ugliest ever.

[Ch. 1133 p11 & Ch. 1131 p17](https://preview.redd.it/pg020ymv818e1.jpg?width=2207&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41e772b448340dd3ad915bad8521872b74a840f2)

A giant woman heads for the protagonists hurrying to tell them Saul fell annd Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Usopp get all worked up over it, even complaining about it. But the giant points at Saul and Robin says it's alright and goes to Saul alone.

This is nuts! This already happened two chapters ago when Robin wasn't even on the island. How is this possible??

I'm going to ignore things like how did they know when exactly was Robin coming? how could Saul not be seen from up above before the flying boat landed? or how did the giant woman know she had to call for help specifically to them? This is clearly a set up to mimic the way Robin and Saul first met and we must believe that woman was simply in cahoots with Saul. Okay, but why is he doing this to begin with??? I mean, would you do this.

Imagine you have a long-lost friend, someone very dear to you, someone to whom you are a parent figure in some way, and you think or at least you hope that someone is being brought to your town by other people you're acquainted with in a rescue mission. They're not preparing a reunion for you. No one's leading her into a big surprise. In fact, she might not know about you being alive or there to begin with and certainly you read in the newspapersabout her more than likely escape from a very dangerous situation but can't possibly know whether she's alive or even in a good condition. She might be severely wounded for all you know.

Would you wait secluded in a naturally hidden place for her to find you or someone to take her to you waiting for the time to enact this theatre play? Isn't this the most retarded decision making we've read here in the last... Who cares? No, it's probably not. We've had a lot of shit, now that I think about. This might be just average.

Luffy, Sanji, Chopper and Usopp's panel too. That is just a theatrical reaction. Not what they'd normally do. Or at least I hope that's not what they'd normally do. It's definitely not what they used to do. When Cricket collapsed in front of them after attacking them, they genuinely cared for him immediately even though he was no one to them. So, every character is acting by the wisdom of plot convenience to fit this scene Oda thought would be nice to have, for some reason.

And I wonder, was this Oda's intention from the beginning? (Not the actual beginning, but like from the beginning of the arc at least) Or is this the only way he's come up with to save some face after writing Saul's fall as a cliff-hanger two chapters ago and then realizing wherever he wanted to go with that it was a very bad idea and that he had to reroute it? Because this is the only explanation I can think of for this second fall of Saul.

After 1331 Saul had fallen. Not in the same way he did this chapter. He could not possibly be enacting this weird way to meet Robin again and have the girl cry for help to... no one. Oda could have just done as though the ending of two chapters ago never existed and had Saul reappear in the story in a more logical way. After all, he's already retcon'd the whole village of Elbaf, he retcon'd Saul's death even... surely he could retcon that little bit too, right? No. It occurred to him that wasting a whole chapter reminiscing of a flashback that was already told just for the sake of it was an amazing idea.

[Ch. 1133 p12 & p13; Ch. 392 p8, p9 & p10](https://preview.redd.it/xsz9jn8z818e1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e1c93f3e4c271054820cf618b349c842856b83e)

For these two pages, Robin and Saul just see each other. There's not much to comment about them. So I threw in some pages from ch. 392 that Oda replicated here in order to re-enact that scene. Please feast your eyes in the beautiful drawing of the past.

If anything, I find it curious that he replicated it even to use the same sound effects in the same place: the ""za za..."" above Saul in the top panel for the waves in the shore or the breeze maybe, I don't know much about japanese onomatopoeia \^\^"", the ""ooooo"" under Saul in the bottom panel for the scare, but he changed the ""tatata..."" I believe it's for Robin walking on the sand, to ""suta suta..."". Maybe that is because despite he's drawing it to be visually the same, Robin is now not walking on true sand but on tree bark? So it sounds differently. If that's the case, then this is a very nice detail. One I imagine most people wouldn't ever notice nor care. But it's the kind of things I enjoy.

[Ch. 1133 p14 & p15](https://preview.redd.it/5jmkc8r0918e1.jpg?width=2208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44de021786ce7db9f37e053592e656317bee50ff)

They start talking, we see Saul lost a leg and the reminiscing of the flashback we already knows continues with the breif addition of how Saul survived.

And here I thought Oda wanted to create this scene to give Robin and Saul a beautiful moment in some way, but turns out this was just an excuse to whitewash Vegapunk, bolster the importance of the previous arc and Vegapunk's speech specifically and try to justify Saul's retcon'd death. The audacity!

So, let's talk about this because I won't stand for this bullshit.

Robin and Saul finally reunite with one another and the first thing they speak about are trivial matters?? ""Hey, did you hear Vegapunk's speech the other day? It was so interesting, huh? Oh, he sure passed down Ohara's message"". HELL NO! Last time they saw each other, Robin saw Saul be frozen to death and Saul saw Robin be completely alone and vulnerable in the middle of a Buster Call to target her with a Marine Admiral next to her. So, how about something more like this:

""Oh my god, Saul, you really are alive!! I'VE MISSED YOU SO SO MUCH!""

""I've missed you too, Robin! I'm so sorry I couldn't help you back then. I can only imagine how horrible all these years have been for you. But... how did you get out of Ohara alive??""

And after they've cried of joy, hugged till their arms are numb and talked about everything that's truly important and relevant, then a week later MAYBE they can look at the camera and start sucking Vegapunk's dick, figuratively speaking. But not the first thing they do.

And if Oda doesn't want to bore us with an emotionall scene where we can see Robin is a human being and has feelings, that's okay. All of us accepted long ago that Robin would never again have any meaningful interaction with her friends, because otherwise she would have said and explained so so many things that she didn't for the sake of plot convenience. But don't use her like this either. Do not rape her character to blow your own dick and validate the mess that was the previous arc and Vegapunk's inconsequential speech. This is disgusting and shameful.

And now let's talk about Saul's retcon. Because this is as much an explanation as we're going to get so now we're not guessing, supposing or speculating any more. It's time to pass judgement to this.

In some way, what Oda did here is kind of clever. Saul melting because of the heat of the fire, thus reverting back to life before being truly dead is not just a possible outcome, in all likeliness that is exactly what happened. So, he's telling us a truth to justify the retcon, and because it's a truth suddenly you may even be convinced that there was no retcon and Saul really never die and there was nothing to complain about in the first place!

Oda is making great use here of what he chooses to show us and what he chooses to hide from us. In fact, there's already a detail that tells us he's not being completely honest and is making shit up: Saul says he woke up in the sea. Melting because of the heat is one thing, but being magically transported to sea it's a different thing. Yes, Saul should have melted by the heat and immediately after he should have also burn to death if he was unconscious, or alternatively he should wake up right there where he was frozen and get away from the fire willingly.

But what Oda is not telling us so that we focus in the sole thing that makes sense, is that after waking up, even if he did so in the sea, the Buster Call should still be ongoing. Marines should be roaming the island looking for possible survivors or more documents to destroy. Specifically, Aokiji should be very aware that his ice could melt and surely after seeing Robin off, he would have returned to Saul to check whether he was truly dead or was precisely melting. I mean, Aokiji said Saul was his best friend (or a very good friend at least), without better things to do and surely not feeling like arguing with Akainu about destroying the evacuation ship, he would return to his friend to confirm whether he had killed him or not. Otherwise, how is Saul supposed to have left Ohara alive? Or at least have survived there until the Marines left. It's impossible. It makes no sense.

Moreover,

[Ch. 433 p17](https://preview.redd.it/8a0o4tg2918e1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d61dcdce84b39d700583a976aa0ec5f56c746d6)

In chapter 433, Aokiji clearly speaks about Saul as a dead person. I wonder if he did it explicitly even, because in the original text of the last panel of this page, Aokiji doesn't say exactly what it says in this translation, but he speaks about having a duty after <someone's> life. This might be an explicit reference to Saul being alive no more, or he could be referencing having to watch over Robin's life. It's not clear to me. Partly because my japanese knowledge is super limited, but partly too because japanese can be spoken in a very criptic way as though you were being revealed a mystical prophecy by an oracle in riddle form and for japanese-speakers that's just tuesday. Regardless, Aokiji spoke here at all moments as though Saul were dead. Specially when he says that now Saul isn't there, the duty to watch over Aokiji befalls on him. That's not something you take responsibility for, specially in fiction stories, unless the one who had that responsability has died.

[Ch. 1133 p16 & p17](https://preview.redd.it/tw3djue4918e1.jpg?width=2195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ff516aba6df47dc89ae38f32d36eb3014ba4749)

Robin makes Saul notice that, despite everything in her life was terrible, she ultimately followed Saul's advice: she stayed alive and found some friends. She also asks for praise, Saul praises her and both cry.

Actually, the bit about finding friends isn't true, though I think it should be. These two pages annoy me. A lot. And I'm aware of what I just said about the previous two, but believe me, these two are even worse.

I get what Oda is trying to do here by showing Robin in this light: vulnerable, lowering her emotional defenses, regessing to a childlike state, seeking validation... He's trying to give some depth to the character, to humanize her a bit. And I really appreciate it but... this comes late and it's wrong and poorly executed.

First of all, Oda wouldn't have the need to do this if he hadn't murdered Robin's character before. Robin already had a character pre-time skip. Only to come back from it almost entirely devoid of such a feature. Her whole character was replaced with an emotionally ice-cold mannequin with a twisted and morbid sense of humor. Something she wasn't before, I might add.

But most important of all, because these tears, this overcoming the pain and this realization of her success in doing what Saul asked her belong to this moment:

[Ch. 398 p17 & p18](https://preview.redd.it/xbbwya86918e1.jpg?width=1570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14b58bd3e3e53fa501b67a9b601114d3d263625f)

and to this moment alone. That is one of the most cathartic moments in the whole manga serving as an inflection point to one of the most loved arcs. The moment Luffy declares war on the world government JUST so that Robin can speak freely without fear for them. Luffy (and the rest) raided Enies Lobby just to hear it directly from her words. Whether she was truly okay with her situation or not. And if she was, then that's okay, but is she wasn't they'd move heaven and earth to rescue her. And that's when she realizes she's found the friends Saul told her she would eventually find and it's only then that she's able to move on.

And now, two years of in-story time later, out of the blue we get this re-enactment of that realization, completely unprompted, unrequired by the situation, in a situation of absolute lack not just of epicness or narrative tension, but anything actually, there's literally nothing going on. Even the faintest shred of a plot we were having that's having a big feast with the giants was abruptly interrupted like an advertisment in the middle of a movie to have this moment rehashing one of One Piece's ""greatest hits"" in a graceless way, while using it as an excuse to justify a retcon and exalt a previous fiasco just for the sake of... I don't know. Giving the chapter a highlight, maybe?

I find this insulting towards Oda's own past work and can't begin to express how terrible it feels to me. My mind is blown by the comparison. Just thinking about what we had and what we're getting nowadays.

But, hey! The retcon is real, this encounter between Robin and Saul is happening and to me that begs for at least one question. Let's see... Turns out Saul lived and escaped (with lots of books of Ohara's scholars even!). The Marines reaction to Saul's giant body being nowhere to be found was:

Marine high-ranking officer 1: ""The body of giant Jaguar D. Saul, who was charged with treason and collusion with Ohara's scholars can't be found. Do we declare him missing in action and issue a bounty for him?""

Marine high-ranking officer 2: ""Better not. Let's just assume he's dead and move on. I'm tired of this shit.""

So, after that, Saul was effectively one of the freest people in the world thanks to the World Government not giving a shit about him. And now he claims to have missed Robin so much. He cries a lot too. But the facts are:

\- He didn't go to see her arrive to Elbaf even though he knew she would.

\- He didn't go with the other giants to help her at Egghead, even though he knew she was in such danger.

\- He, for 22 long years has read newspapers with news of Robin suffering hell on earth every single day of her life and did NOTHING.

He stayed comfortably hidden in Elbaf, reading those newspapers with a hot coffee in his hand saying to himself ""I should help Robin, that poor little girl I love and care so much for. Maybe once I'm done reading all these books I saved from Ohara. Oh look! There's still a heap of them left. It's too bad... They're so tiny I can barely read anything at all, I have to really force my eyesight. Well maybe in 50 years or so I'll be done. Then I'll do something about Robin. She deserves to be happy. :) ""

All he had to do was get a hair cut, put on different clothes and look for her under the safety that no one is actively looking for him and he's basically dead to the world. Donquixote Dofla'emon, one of my favourite characters post-time skip is a living proof that a little costume works wonders in this world. So it shouldn't have been a big deal. But no. Saul did nothing. And if I were Nico Robin, rather than looking for praise from him I'll be expecting a very thorough and convincing apology from him. Because Saul spoke to her about some wonderful friends she'd make in life, but in this retcon'd reality he was surely not one of them.

Finally, to end this review that turned out way longer than I wanted it to be, I want to discuss something less dramatic if possible.

[Ch. 1133, clockwise from top-left: p10, p14, p16, p17 & p13](https://preview.redd.it/kzoow7j8918e1.jpg?width=1885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=145f8a547b970b0bf3747b815ac8bc6a26423514)

As you can see, we first had a very beautiful picture of this place with a library sitting in a huge branch above the lake surrounded by more branches/ground and other buildings. But then EVERYTHING was erased because Oda wanted to draw panels identical to the ones in chapter 392. After that... Well, you see that behind Saul and to his right, sometimes there is something, sometimes there isn't, but never again the library, the huge branch above nor the waterfalls we were specifically talked about. Now it's not just Nami's sword that goes missing from panel to panel (it still does), entire landscapes appear and disappear.

At least Lilith and Bonney don't appear in last panel. It's something I suppose.

Thank you very much for reading until the end.

Each day, we're announcing a few ""anchor"" picket lines. Workers are asking allies and community supporters to join us on the line TODAY (Dec. 20th) in:

‚Ä¢ LOS ANGELES, CA (Burbank): 1190 W Alameda Ave
Ste G-2 starting at 10am PST

SEATTLE, WA: 1124 Pike St (Pike St. Roastery)
starting at 3pm PST

‚Ä¢ CHICAGO, IL: 5964 N Ridge Ave starting at 12pm
CST

Starbucks baristas are going on five days of escalating ULP strikes in response to the company backtracking on our promised path forward, starting in these three cities. Over these five days, hundreds of stores will join... THIS WILL BE SWU'S BIGGEST STRIKE YET

Since February, Starbucks has repeatedly pledged publicly that they intended to reach contracts by the end of the year - but they've yet to present workers with a serious economic proposal. This week, less than two weeks before their end-of-year deadline, Starbucks proposed no immediate wage increase for union baristas, and a guarantee of only 1.5% wage increases in future years.

Our unfair labor practice (ULP) strikes will begin Friday morning and escalate each day through Christmas Eve... unless Starbucks honors our commitment to work towards a foundational framework.

!. ALLIES: Support us by signing up for our Solidarity Canvass and join us in hosting an event at not-yet union stores between Dec. 20 and Dec. 24! Your support can help workers get the contracts they deserve!

1hins3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hins3x/girlfriend_keeps_saying_i_dont_know_to_everything/,"Girlfriend keeps saying ""I don't know"" to everything and constantly cries when it's time to go home.","A bit of info:

I, M 20, am in my first relationship with F 19. She has been with someone else prior, lasting for 3 years. We've known eachother now for more than a year and have been together for 3 months now. I'm currently taking a break year to work, get a driver's license and prepare my portfolio and she's off to university in the capital city. 

Note, I'm autistic so i mostly rationalize things/problems but I'm trying my best to understand and relate with ""feelings"" if you understand what I mean.

Now, we're 100kms apart and see eachother once/twice a week when she comes home. We also keep our relationship a secret because her parents wouldn't really approve of us being together. And.. she's not really doing a good job hiding it. (She says who's she's going out with, etc) Despite me saying to keep it low-key. Mind you she has a really healthy and loving relationship with her parents. She's never faced any abuse or anything and can't grasp the fact that i was neglected and abused as a child.

She's the most loving, accepting and understanding person I can ever have for a partner as i have some severe body image issues that I'll not disclose so i basically found a diamond amongst rubble. 

But here's the thing that only bothers me:
She's very indecisive and always replies with ***""I don't know""*** to almost everything. 
""Do you want to go to x or y place?""
-""I don't know""
""Should we go this way or that way?""
-""I don't know.""
""What do you want to eat?""
-""I don't know."" 

It doesn't stop there, even when we were getting slightly more intimate, i asked her first for her boundaries, where she wants to and doesn't want to be touched and all i got was:
""I don't know.""
How can you not know how to decide about something as serious as this?

Now, i tried to be as indirect as possible as i saw that maybe my directness was perceived as forcefulness? Idk, but i try to be as gentle and delicate as I can. I subtly encourage her to be more comfortable in her decisions and stuff but it hasn't really gone anywhere yet.

It's really frustrating to me because i strive for communication in relationships.

Now onto the second thing that worries me, her always crying when she has to go home/leave for uni.
It always happens and i don't know what to do about it. I tried to ask her what's wrong, even subtly, giving her the space to talk or guide her through her feelings but all i got was once again, ""I don't know"" or ""Everything's fine, i just don't know.""
The last time we were together a week ago she cried 8 whole times in the span of 3 hours.. for no known reason.. When she came to pick me up, when she was driving, when we were at some coffee shop, when we were walking, when she dropped me off etc. etc.
I can't for the life of me understand why this happens to her. 
FYI, no, she's not depressed or has some type of trauma/mental illness (that i truly know of). We've already talked that through a while ago so I'm really puzzled by this. At this rate, I'm tempted to reach out to her parents so they have a talk with her because they know her the most. Just to check in and reassure/try to figure out what's bothering her.

Tl;Dr: Gf is extremely indecisive and constantly cries for no apparent reason but isn't mentally ill.

So, what should I do in this situation? I don't want to break up or anything as it's been barely 3 months and I'm sure it'll be crushing for the both of us. If more context is needed, I'll happily reply to any questions. Thank you.",1,1734712781.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hins2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1hins2n/my_fasting_results_mental_impact/,My fasting results: mental impact ,"My fasting results: the mental impact

I (32f) did a water fast in November right before Thanksgiving. My goal was to do 14 days, but I had made it to day 7 and got severely ill. It was a lack of education that caused me to be sick because I realized the meds I take impact my ability to absorb some of the vitamins I was taking. You live and you learn! 

But, I wanted to talk about the mental impact fasting gave me and I have to say, I‚Äôm very happy with it. 

Day 1-3 was a struggle. I was dreaming of food and realizing how much of my day was surrounded by food decisions. I kept going to the kitchen just to walk back out. Energy was pretty low too.

Day 4-5 the hunger was gone but there was a mental struggle with my food habits.  

Day 6-7 I had an insane amount of energy and mental clarity. My smell increased and the energy I was feeling was great. Unlike coffee, the boost of energy felt real and productive with no side effects. 

It was really after the fact that the results were impressive. I lost about 10lbs during the fast that I have yet to gain back. Do I understand the physics of that? No. Am I mad about it? Also no. Even more so, my best result was my relationship with food. My cravings for sugar and fast food is gone and has stayed gone. I‚Äôm no longer boredom eating and I feel full much quicker. I enjoy foods as a sustenance versus as a coping mechanism. Before, I would buy a pint of icecream and eat the whole thing in one sitting. I can buy that, and enjoy a few bites and I genuinely do not want anymore. It was such a positive impact for me since I have battled with my relationship with food my entire life.

Prior to this fast, I had lost 50lbs since February as a result of going to the gym and slowly improving my diet as a whole. I have about 20 more lbs to go to reach my goal weight. I was obese at the beginning of the year and now I am just overweight (almost in the normal weight range!) 

I have started another fast yesterday and I‚Äôm looking forward to feeling the benefits again. ",3,1734712778.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

However, he's now strongly encouraging me to set up a store on a platform called Esmeo (see attached image 1), which he claims to use himself.

Here‚Äôs how the platform supposedly works:

* When I receive an order, I‚Äôm required to pay the product cost upfront by transferring money to a designated bank account.
* After payment, the item is shipped to the buyer.
* Once the buyer confirms receipt, my shop is credited the full order amount as a store balance, which can theoretically be withdrawn later.

I‚Äôm feeling unsure about this setup. Has anyone heard of Esmeo or used it before? I noticed the company is listed on the Colorado Secretary of State website (see attached image 2). Does that registration alone mean the business is legitimate?

I 25(M) need help understanding what went down between this girl (22) and I. 

I was popping into a local coffee place for a while, and the first time I went I thought the girl who took my order was a major cutie. So cute I felt nervous to talk to her, and for me, that was new I never get nervous. I continue to pop in, and the interactions between us only got better and better. I started getting green flags left and right, I thought something was cooking up because one day she‚Äôd ask my name, then told me she liked my hoodie, and would always drag on the small talk. I couldn‚Äôt decide how to ask her out, but one day, I finally did it. I asked her to hangout, and I gave her my number. 
                 
Fast forward to the weekend, we go out and get a drink, chat for a while. It was amazing, I had her smiling the whole time. She was nervous for sure, she could barely finish sentences, and her hands were blue from rubbing her jeans so much. But the talk was amazing. We had so much in common, same beliefs and goals (for what we touched on). We talked about our love languages, she made comments that provided reassuring foreshadowing, like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to take me golfing when it warms up in the summer then‚Äù I was like shit, she must see us working out then. So I let my heart open up a bit, and I accepted what was happening, because it kinda felt like what I‚Äôve been waiting, and preserving my time for. 
 
We stay in touch throughout the following week, we made plans to see a movie Friday, but they fell thru because her hair appointment got pushed back an hour, and ran over. I wasn‚Äôt mad at all, told her I could probably still refund our tickets and we could go tomorrow, (because I wanted to see her hair and her). But we ended up deciding her coming to my house to watch a movie that following night instead. She had plans with family and friends that day, I knew she wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to make it over until late if she did. Which, is exactly what happened. 11 PM she texts me she‚Äôs about to head my way. I shoot her my location, parking info, and to text me when she gets here. 50 minutes later, I look outside my house, and she‚Äôs parked in the road in front of my house, and I haven‚Äôt heard from her. I texted her, gave it 5 minutes, and decided to go out there. I walked up to the window, knock, and then 3 minutes later, she gets out, and says, ‚Äúso funny story for you, my car just like went black on the way here, you wanna see?‚Äù So we walk over to her car, and the passenger foot wouldn‚Äôt unlock. For clarification, it‚Äôs a new Audi SUV, idk the model, but all the Instruments you would need for speed, gas, etc are screens. Nothing in the car had light or power, and the headlights and taillights were very dim. I‚Äôm a general contractor, idk cars, but it sounded like a battery/alternator problem. I told her to pop the hood to inspect for a loose battery terminal, but there was no battery under the hood, and I went to shut it. She then says ‚Äúmy sister said I could probably call a tow truck‚Äù I offered reassurance that her insurance will probably send one out for free. I asked what she wanted to do, get taken home, come inside, or wait for a tow or what?? 
She says, I‚Äôll just wait for the tow truck, I already called it. I said ‚Äúoh okay, well I‚Äôll wait with you‚Äù she said, ‚Äúno it‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm just really depressed about this‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwell are you sure it‚Äôs cold out, come inside at least‚Äù. She said no, so I respected her wishes, hugged her, and said ‚Äúgood luck, I‚Äôll be inside if you need anything text me.‚Äù I reached out a couple of times to check on her, after no hearing back, and my last message didn‚Äôt go through, I was worried her phone died.  I ran out there to see how she was doing. No light no movement in the car, and I knocked on the door, and heard nothing. This was 2 hours later at this point. I figured she got a ride home, so I texted her that, and went to sleep. She texted me another 2 hours later (she sat there for 4 hours). Texted me at 4 am saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm literally so sorry, I was definitely still in there and knocked back, he‚Äôs hooking my car up now and we should be leaving soon‚Äù. 

I texted her back, insisting she not be sorry, she didn‚Äôt nothing wrong, I‚Äôm sorry about her car, and I appreciate her trying to come over at least. 

I didn‚Äôt hear from her all morning, I shot her a text that afternoon as well. No response. 

Texted her the following day, and asked how her day was going. 

I waited two more days, and basically asked how she was doing, told her I‚Äôm there for her, asked about her car, but if this isn‚Äôt what she is feeling, to just be straight up. And still, nothing. 


I thought this was my time for that magical chick flick love story, I really did. Literally any input about all this I‚Äôll take.

Just another quick update on the status of Holiday Scorched and some other current bugs we‚Äôre working super hard to appear to have tried to resolve.



Many will notice the most recent bug that causes the game‚Äôs lore to have reversed itself, resulting in an admittedly tedious gaming experience. Upon logging in, your character spawns at a completely intact Morgantown business establishment where you are employed, with no signs of nuclear war having occurred. As a result of this recent bug, which we are working hard to address, America seems to have signed a peace treaty with China, returned Canada to a state of independence, and happily, if uneventfully, resumed peacetime life. We recognize that this is an inconvenience for our players who are used to exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and we regret how tedious it has become to work under the assistant manager of the Morgantown Red Rocket, Dale, who happens to be quite a dick.



We tried increasing the spawn rate of customers coming through the Red Rocket in an attempt to occupy Dale and keep him off your back. We have also added a number of food trucks serving coffee and chili near the establishment to further distract the unbearable Dale, who will hound them for permits and threaten them by yelling that his brother-in-law is a cop.



Unfortunately, this increase in spawn rate had adverse effects on the Red Rocket‚Äôs bathroom, where customers seem to be doubled-over with chili groans and demolishing the toilet. At least there are still some bombs being dropped in Appalachia! Your character will regrettably be responsible for scrubbing down the restroom with Abraxo on an hourly basis (one of our new mutated public events).



We will be addressing this issue in the Atomic Shop over the next two weeks, where each player will be able to claim a unique ‚ÄúLetter of Recommendation‚Äù item, which they can hopefully use to apply to more engaging positions within the Morgantown business community. We will also be granting FO1st members one day‚Äôs worth of paid time off, during which Dale will only text you twice asking if you could come in and cover for Roger, who called out sick again.



Santatron will remain available, and gift wrap will still be purchasable at the train station vendors! Players might notice, however, that their character‚Äôs sister‚Äôs car, which they borrow from time to time, is on the fritz again, so getting to the train station will be a hassle. This issue can reportedly be avoided if your character hails a cab, but please note that you will be expected to pay for the trip in pre-war money, and be heartily laughed at by any NPCs who catch you trying to pay for goods or services with bottle caps.¬†



Additionally, players will be promptly arrested near Morgantown Airport if openly wielding a firearm. For a limited time in the Atom Shop, a public defender can be claimed at no cost, or you may prefer to purchase a more reputable attorney under the ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù tab.



Please note that the event known as ‚ÄúEviction Notice‚Äù is also bugged and is now very, very literal. Your character will require somewhere to crash for a few months while they get their shit figured out after being booted from their apartment and hounded by debt collectors.¬†



Additional known bugs at this time include but are not limited to:



\-Spending any considerable length of time in Atlantic City will result in your character contracting gonorrhea¬†

\-Players WILL find themselves racially profiled if they attempt to enter the Whitesprings Resort

\-Settler and Raider factions have regrettably been replaced by Democrats and Republicans

\-Obtaining new gatling plasma mod plans has become even more of a grind as players are now required to enroll in Vault-Tec University, followed by 8 years of graduate work and a research fellowship in order to invent the gatling plasma and its mods

\-The game no longer involves violence, monsters, enemies (except for Dale), mutations, or camp building (property rights and trespassing, as well as construction requiring permits, unfortunately now apply)

\-Due to crowds, the DMV quest now takes roughly 5x longer



Please note players having to long-press a button just to open the emote wheel is NOT a bug; we did that just to piss you off.¬†",0,1734712599.0,fo76,6,0.3,False

This morning I decided to give it a try, with a French Vanilla Timothy's k-cup. It was the vilest drink I ever had, worst than gaz station automated ""latte"" machines.  A watery sugary foul abomination. I don't think I can in good conscience offer this to my clients. 

So, I need some help here trying to figure out what is the best k-cup just for a non watered down coffee that comes close to an actual cappuccino or latte. Is there such thing? 

I did try using less water, it wasn't as watered down but the sweetness was enough to make my head spin in a bad way.

1hink5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1hink5b/unfiltered_pt_1/,Unfiltered pt. 1,"\- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always believed that the human brain is the most complicated map in existence. Every thought, every emotion, everything is woven in such an intricate, delicate way. And yet, it‚Äôs all controlled by something that, for some reason, we think we understand, but we don‚Äôt. What happens when the brain starts to fail? Or worse, what happens when someone, of their own free will, starts to ignore the signals? The red lights that the brain should turn on, but never does. Those are the minds that interest me. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Because what I discovered, what I‚Äôm about to reveal, will change everything we know about human behavior.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúAt first, I thought there was a simple explanation for what I was looking for. A few miswired neurons, a bit of faulty genetics‚Ä¶ But the truth is much darker than that. When the mind cracks, when psychopathy and crime emerge from the shadows, the answers are more complicated than one might imagine. But still, I can‚Äôt stop looking. Because when it comes to the human mind, there‚Äôs something very seductive about unraveling what‚Äôs beyond the visible.‚Äù

Martina‚Äôs voice is clear, but there‚Äôs something in her tone that can‚Äôt be easily identified. A subtle shudder in her words, as if she were talking about something that has her trapped, even though she can‚Äôt help it. There‚Äôs an obsession, not just scientific, but personal.

\- ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. My name is Martina. I‚Äôm a neuroscientist, although I don‚Äôt usually call myself that too much. My coworkers call me ‚Äòthe weird one‚Äô because of my approach. Nobody understands why, sometimes, I spend entire days researching human behavior and its darkest disorders. I‚Äôm the one who always looks for patterns in broken minds, those that fall between the margins of normality. People sometimes look at me as if I‚Äôm dangerous. And no, I‚Äôm not talking about those crazy people in horror movies. I'm talking about those cases that psychiatrists dismiss as 'anomalies', as 'complex minds'. These are the people who really intrigue me. Those, the ones who never fit in, the ones everyone avoids. The ones who, in the end, make the difference.‚Äù

Martina reflects in silence while the soft sound of a coffee machine in the background resonates in the room. The noises are constant, but the feeling that the scene generates is one of isolation. Martina is alone in her thoughts, immersed in something much bigger than herself. This is where her story begins.

\- ‚ÄúOver the years, I have worked with many experts, but I can't say that they have all understood the 'why' of this research. Although, of course, I don't care too much what they think. Dr. Avery, for example... I would never understand him. He's a brilliant guy, sure, but sometimes his methods... his ways so... cold... almost calculating, make my hair stand on end. He's British, which probably explains his distance. She always has a distant look, as if she were looking at something through a fog that no one else can see. But what bothers me is her silence.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúThen there is Sofia. She is completely different, her mindset... she is more open, warmer. She will never admit it, but she has become fond of the team, of the people. Even though she feels like a fish out of water, she always has something to say, something to add to the analysis, something to question what we think we know about human beings and their relationships with nature. People like Sofia, who observe ecosystems, the connections between animals and human behavior, are disconcerting to me. But not in a bad way. It gives me hope in a way. Even though she never tells me, I know that she is as caught up in this mystery as I am. She, like me, is looking for answers.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúBut, of course, not all the team shares my enthusiasm. Some are only here because they are interested in the money or the prestige that comes with the project.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúI can't tell you everything now. It's not the time. But when this investigation comes to an end, when everything falls apart... you will understand what we discovered. And what we did, what I did to stop him.‚Äù

The laboratory is silent, the distant hum of computers blending with the whisper of leaves tapping against the windows in the gentle breeze. It‚Äôs early morning, but the tension in the air is already palpable. I sit at a desk covered with papers: studies on bee behavior, charts on their communication through pheromones, and detailed observations of movements within the hives. The images of the bees are vivid in my mind‚Äîtheir flight in perfect harmony, like a clock in motion. But today, I can‚Äôt focus on that. I sense Sofia‚Äôs presence behind me before hearing her voice.

\- ""How‚Äôs the data from Hive 3 coming along?"" she asks in her usually upbeat tone, though there‚Äôs something in her voice that makes me think she‚Äôs uneasy too.

\- ""I don‚Äôt know,"" I reply, running a hand through my hair. ""The behavior in Hive 3 seems off. They‚Äôre more agitated than usual. It‚Äôs like something is disturbing them.""

Sofia steps closer, looking at the data on my screen. Her eyes scan the graphs and notes I‚Äôve been taking, then meet mine with a mix of uncertainty and concern.

\- ""Do you think something might be interfering with their pheromones?"" she suggests. ""Maybe there‚Äôs an external factor we‚Äôre overlooking.""

\- ""That‚Äôs what I think. Their flight patterns are erratic, and not just in one hive, but in several. It could be something in the environment, or maybe... something else,"" I say, my voice faltering despite trying to sound confident.

Sofia raises an eyebrow, unsure of exactly what I mean. Before she can ask, Dr. Avery walks into the room. Always so formal, so meticulous, each step calculated as if measuring his presence.

\- ""What do we have here, ladies?"" His tone is curt but not entirely rude. To be fair, he always carries an air of being on a mission he doesn‚Äôt fully understand. ""Any progress with the bees?""

Sofia responds quickly, as she always does, trying to avoid any potential conflict.

\- ""We‚Äôre observing some strange patterns. Over the past few weeks, the bees in several hives have shown signs of disturbance. We‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs causing it.""

Dr. Avery approaches, glances at the data on my screen, and after a moment of silence, nods dismissively.

\- ""And what do you propose to do about it?"" His tone suggests he‚Äôs less concerned about the bees than we are. He‚Äôs focused on progress, on results‚Äînot details that can‚Äôt be controlled.

\- ""We wanted to run a series of tests, maybe expose them to different controlled environments to see how they react, but..."" Sofia hesitates, glancing at the other team members who have started entering the room. ""What if it‚Äôs something else? Something out of the ordinary?""

Sofia‚Äôs words hang in the air, heavier than I expected. Dr. Avery looks at her with a blank expression, as though he doesn‚Äôt grasp her implication.

\- ""What I‚Äôm interested in, ladies,"" Dr. Avery begins, interrupting whatever Sofia was about to say, ""is getting concrete results. This isn‚Äôt about theories. If something is interfering with the bees, we need to know what it is, period. We don‚Äôt have time for... speculations.""

The tension is palpable. It‚Äôs rare to see Dr. Avery this involved in a conversation that isn‚Äôt directly about outcomes.

\- ""I know,"" I say, feeling my mind racing, though something feels wrong‚Äîsomething I can‚Äôt quite articulate. ""But I think we‚Äôre facing something that could be more... more than just an environmental issue.""

Sofia shoots me a quick glance. She feels it too. Sometimes, words aren‚Äôt necessary to understand what the other is thinking. At that moment, the team gathers around the table, and Dr. Avery shifts the discussion to a formal meeting about progress and next steps. The topic slips away; here, all they want is... results.

It‚Äôs late. The laboratory is almost empty, the sound of the keyboard and the faint hum of the coffee machine breaking the silence. The clock on the wall reads 9:15 PM. At this hour, I‚Äôm usually in my office, surrounded by books and papers, preparing for the class I need to teach on free will. But tonight, I can‚Äôt focus. My mind is trapped in a whirlwind of thoughts that don‚Äôt seem to fit together.

I‚Äôm reviewing studies on the human brain, recent research on decision-making, and the surprising conclusions of neuroscientists. Something lingers in my mind, but I can‚Äôt process it. I open another article‚Äîa study discussing how the human brain makes decisions even before we, as individuals, are aware of them, precisely 550 milliseconds before we realize it. *It‚Äôs as if we‚Äôre puppets of the brain,* I think, rereading the words.

I remember when I first learned about Benjamin Libet‚Äôs experiments. In those studies, participants thought they were making decisions in real time, but in reality, their brains had already activated the necessary areas to carry out the decision seconds before they became aware of it. In other words, our brain seems to take control before we can even say, ‚ÄúI decided.‚Äù Does that mean we‚Äôre entirely subject to a destiny we can‚Äôt control?

My thoughts drift to something more unsettling. If our brain makes decisions without our consent, could that explain criminal behavior? Could the lack of control justify atrocious acts? Perhaps criminals, murderers, aren‚Äôt entirely responsible for what they do if the brain makes the decisions for them. But I can‚Äôt help but question: is it really that simple?

I can‚Äôt stop reading‚Äîpage after page. The information about the brain areas involved in criminal behavior pulls me in, another piece of the puzzle forming in my mind. The amygdala, that small almond-shaped structure, is responsible for emotion, fear, anger, and reward processing. The prefrontal cortex, located at the front of the brain, is associated with rational decision-making, impulse control, and morality. It‚Äôs as if the battle between emotion and reason plays out inside our brains.

But something holds me back. Something doesn‚Äôt fit. Something beyond the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. The thalamus. This ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù that connects sensory information to the brain, integrating what we perceive from the outside world. It‚Äôs the processing center of our reality. What if dysregulation in the thalamus has something to do with criminal behavior? It‚Äôs an idea that flashes in my mind suddenly, like a light in the darkness. If the thalamus isn‚Äôt properly managing sensory information, if it‚Äôs sending incorrect signals to the brain, could that influence how we perceive the world? Could it lead to violence, impulsivity, a lack of empathy?

My heart beats faster, as if a switch has flipped in my mind. I stare at the computer screen for a moment, frozen. The hypothesis slowly takes shape, a sketch of a theory that could change everything. *This needs to be explored,* I think. But I don‚Äôt have much time‚Äîmy class on free will starts in a few hours. I quickly review my notes for the lecture, but now the words feel empty, as if they no longer matter. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this hypothesis. I need to research more, and I need to share it with someone who can help me understand if it holds any weight.

I open my office door and head down the hallway to the laboratory where Sofia usually works. I find her reviewing some charts on bee behavior.

\- ""Sofia,"" I call her urgently, my voice trembling with excitement. ""I have a new hypothesis. About criminal behavior... I think there‚Äôs something more. Something in the brain we haven‚Äôt considered.""

Sofia turns to me, startled by my tone.

\- ""What‚Äôs going on, Martina? Have you discovered something? Wait‚Äîour project is about bees. Why are you developing hypotheses about humans and... murderers?""

\- ""It‚Äôs the thalamus. I‚Äôve been reading about free will and criminal behavior, and I think the thalamus might be involved. If it doesn‚Äôt properly regulate sensory information, we could be seeing a distortion of reality‚Äîone that could justify certain impulsive or even criminal behaviors.""

Sofia stares at me in silence for a moment. Her expression grows thoughtful, as if she‚Äôs weighing what I just said.

\- ""That sounds... interesting, but it‚Äôs also a pretty risky hypothesis, isn‚Äôt it?"" she replies, rubbing her chin as she thinks. ""Are you sure there‚Äôs something about the thalamus that could influence that kind of behavior?""

\- ""I‚Äôm not sure, but it‚Äôs something I want to explore. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that criminal behavior is often linked to alterations in brain areas like the amygdala or the prefrontal cortex. If everything is connected, maybe the thalamus is the missing link.""

Sofia nods slowly, as if considering the possibility.

\- ""Alright, Martina. But we should discuss this with the team. This could change the course of our research. If we‚Äôre willing to go down this path, we need stronger evidence.""

Anxiety consumes me. I know I‚Äôve made a decision, but I also feel the weight of what it implies. Could this be what finally leads us to discover something big?

The tension in the air is palpable as I stand in front of the meeting room mirror, adjusting my hair and mentally reviewing the notes for what I‚Äôm about to say. Sofia is next to me, just as nervous, though she appears calmer. She doesn‚Äôt know how the research group will react to my hypothesis‚Äîand neither do I.

\- ‚ÄúAre you sure this is what you want to do?‚Äù Sofia asks, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.

\- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have another choice. If I don‚Äôt do it now, I never will. But... I need your help to make my hypothesis make sense,‚Äù I reply, feeling my words catch in my throat. ‚ÄúI promise it‚Äôll all come together. After the meeting, we‚Äôll find the answers we need.‚Äù

Sofia gives me a slight nod, though her expression is full of uncertainty. As for me, I‚Äôm determined but also feel a knot in my stomach. What if they don‚Äôt believe me? What if all this is just an illusion I‚Äôve created in my head? The door opens, and Avery, the group director, walks in. His presence, always imposing, fills the room. He‚Äôs a tall man with short hair and thick-rimmed glasses. He has a way of looking at people that makes you feel like you‚Äôre constantly being analyzed.

\- ‚ÄúMartina,‚Äù he says with a slight smile, observing my nervousness. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ready for the meeting. Remember, we‚Äôre here to discuss the project results. I want to know what factor explains the erratic behavior of the bees.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúYes, Avery,‚Äù I respond, trying to make my voice sound steady. ‚ÄúBut before we dive into the details of bee behavior, I want to talk about something else. Something that‚Äôs been on my mind.‚Äù

He frowns slightly, intrigued, but nods.

\- ‚ÄúMake it quick, Martina. We‚Äôre short on time. If you‚Äôve got something to say, now‚Äôs the moment.‚Äù

Sofia looks at me, as if urging me to get to the point, and I take a deep breath, glancing at the research group already gathered around the table. There‚Äôs a murmur of conversations and a few nervous laughs, but the room quickly quiets as everyone notices I‚Äôm standing. With one hand gripping my notes, I begin to speak.

\- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about something that could change the course of our research. For weeks, we‚Äôve been focused on bee behavior and how their action patterns have started to deviate from the expected. But what‚Äôs been on my mind isn‚Äôt just about the bees‚Ä¶ what I want to investigate now is human behavior. Specifically, criminal behavior.‚Äù 

At these words, the room falls silent. My colleagues‚Äô faces light up with expressions of confusion, curiosity, and, in some cases, skepticism. At the back of the room, Avery adjusts his glasses and watches me intently.

\- ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, Martina?‚Äù Avery asks, his voice betraying his surprise. ‚ÄúAre you suggesting that criminal behavior has something to do with what we‚Äôre studying about the bees?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúNo, not exactly,‚Äù I respond, my voice trembling slightly. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm suggesting is that human behavior, particularly criminal behavior, could be influenced by dysfunction in the brain areas that control our perception of the world. Specifically, I‚Äôm talking about the thalamus.‚Äù

I see some team members exchange glances, their eyes full of doubt. Others start jotting down notes. I feel slightly more at ease, knowing at least they‚Äôre paying attention.

\- ‚ÄúMartina,‚Äù Javier, one of the researchers, interjects. He‚Äôs a tall man with curly hair and glasses. ‚ÄúAre you saying that the behavior of murderers can be explained by malfunctions in the thalamus? That people who commit crimes have no control over their actions?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù I quickly reply, searching for the right words. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is that if the thalamus, which regulates the integration of sensory information, isn‚Äôt functioning properly, we could be seeing a distortion of reality. This could explain impulsivity, a lack of empathy, and, in extreme cases, criminal behavior. This is something I want to explore further. The bees might be a clue, but this is much bigger.‚Äù

Avery leans back in his chair, thoughtful. His gaze shifts from me to the rest of the group.

\- ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre asking me to shift the project‚Äôs focus to something we haven‚Äôt even tested yet? A hypothesis that might be completely wrong?‚Äù

My heart races, but I take a deep breath before answering.

\- ‚ÄúYes, Avery. But I also think it‚Äôs a unique opportunity. If we can prove that this type of brain dysfunction is behind criminal behavior, we could gain a new understanding of psychopathy, criminality, and justice.‚Äù

The silence in the room stretches as my words sink in. Finally, Avery leans forward, his eyes fixed on me. Everyone waits for his response.

\- ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he says after a moment of reflection. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll allow you to pursue this line of investigation. But I want you to have a clear plan. If we‚Äôre going to make this shift, we need an experimental design and results quickly. We can‚Äôt afford to waste time.‚Äù

I feel a wave of relief, though the nerves remain. Avery hasn‚Äôt said a full ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but he‚Äôs agreed to explore the possibility. That‚Äôs all I needed.

\- ‚ÄúThank you, Avery. You won‚Äôt regret it,‚Äù I say, feeling adrenaline course through my veins.

Days later, Sofia and I are in the lab, staring at the whiteboard covered in diagrams and data about the mice we‚Äôll use for the experiment. Lab animals are perfect for this: small, manageable, and with a nervous system similar enough to humans to extrapolate results. My hypothesis is starting to take shape.

\- ‚ÄúAre you sure we want to do this, Martina?‚Äù Sofia asks as she jots down some notes. ‚ÄúWhat if something goes wrong?‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have another choice. This is our chance to prove something revolutionary,‚Äù I reply, looking at the experiment‚Äôs blueprint I‚Äôve designed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to test how thalamus dysfunction affects the mice‚Äôs behavior. And if we succeed, this could change everything we know about human behavior.‚Äù

Sofia smiles, though I know she shares my doubts. But she also feels the excitement of the research‚Äîand I don‚Äôt blame her. Because from now on, the project will be entirely different.",1,1734712174.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

1hingk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1hingk6/liz_and_tj_are_the_worst/,Liz and TJ are the WORST,"Liz and TJ are awful people. TJ is an idiot and Liz is lazy and selfish. 

1) Liz sends her CHILD to live with an uncle that the kid hasn‚Äôt seen in years, thinking Luke would be better for him than she was. Instead of abandoning her teenage son, she could have brought him to stars hollow, asked to live with Luke and tried to raise him there. She got tired of dealing with him acting out because of her lax attitude and awful parenting so she abandoned him. 

2) Liz comes to Luke‚Äôs and lets TJ into her brother‚Äôs apartment unsupervised, with her history of being with men who take off and take stuff with them, was super stupid and irresponsible. She takes food with her from Luke‚Äôs business to cook for TJ and acts like Luke is being ridiculous. 

3) Liz and TJ get married. They weasel their way into Luke‚Äôs and slowly offload a majority of responsibilities onto him because they don‚Äôt want to deal with it. 

4) Liz and TJ get into an accident and ask for help. Not so crazy, any loving family member would agree to help them until they were on their feet. Until we see TJ being an absolute bum and Liz enabling him to drag out as long as they can so Luke can once again do a majority of the work for them. 

5) The next thing I remember is Liz agreeing to make a thanksgiving meal (?) , but deciding to do it at Luke‚Äôs because she doesn‚Äôt have a setup, in the middle of the business day, in the middle of his diner, not even upstairs in the apartment. She gets the biscuits open then she asks ONE OF LUKES CUSTOMERS to help her. As Luke is like fine whatever I‚Äôll help you, she hands it over and goes and gets a cup of coffee and I‚Äôm sure he does the rest. 

6) Liz and TJ bursting into Luke‚Äôs apartment and fighting during a date. Liz comes in and maybe just maybe she‚Äôll be a good sister and get her boyfriend out of the house and apologize profusely? Nope. Keeps on fighting and she locks herself right in Luke‚Äôs bathroom and TJ stays put and keeps on sobbing. 

*my memory is spotty these are the moments that stuck out*

7) Liz TJ and Doula stay with Luke under the false pretense of coming to support Luke since they think he‚Äôs lonely. Then it comes out that they have a moth infestation and they need to crash at his place. During this visit they use his tackle and fishing line to make jewelry, and they use the garbage disposal soaking his apartment AFTER BEING TOLD NOT TO, and TJ admits it but he thought Luke was exaggerating. 

8) Liz and TJ TRY TO SELL LUKES BOAT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. Saying they need space for Liz‚Äôs jewelry supplies. Selling Luke‚Äôs DEAD FATHERS BOAT that he put so much effort into restoring. 

Honorable mention: TJ knocked a hole into Lorelais house after Liz pestered Luke into letting TJ do contracting work.

My mom has always had a very shy personality, she needs to get used to people over time, and she was always very fond of me (before i transitioned) when i came out thing were kind of weird around us (not because she was unsupportive) but i think she just saw me differently. the year i came out i met my best friend, lets call her B.
 B has a very unhinged and unique personality, shes the complete opposite of shy and sne views herself as the ideal human when in reality she does the craziest things, she also talks A LOT, she rants about every little thing because she says she ""hates silence"" and since she is very easy to talk to my mom became close with her very fast. the problem started after a couple hangouts, basically we were out at some store i think and B needed something to call my mom because she felt her first name was too personal and last name was too formal for how close they are so B started calling my mom ""Mother"" and this is what ive been calling my mom for YEARSSSS. (my mom has B in her phone as ""Adopted Child"")Then in it escalated by whenever me, my mom and B go out shopping, B would BEG my mom for anything she laid her eyes on that she found even just slightly appealing, my mom found it really funny B was a begging for these random item and she always gave in, while denying me of stuff i wanted. Then whenever me and my mom would go shopping without B, my mom would see anything that B MIGHT like,  points it out and laughs like ""Oh, look at this B, would love this, send a picture of this to her"" this wouldn't be a problem if it was just a couple things but no! ITS EVERY ITEM WE SEE!!! and then she goes to say ""we should bring B here again she would love this."" A couple months after this me and B starting going thrifting more as opposed to a mall. A few times, me and B would separate from my mom to go shop and when we meet up with my mom she has up to 10-15 items of clothing ALL FOR B, none for me!!! Recently we started getting starbucks a lot (its become our thing kinda) and everytime B begs for the biggest size because she loves her coffee and everytime my mom would say no because thats a lot of coffee. this only happened once where my mom got her the biggest size without telling me and got me the smallest. B also used to eat dinner with my mom and stepdad frequently, as in without me. they would all sit at the dinner table and eat dinner, while i would sit in my room and eat by myself (i do this because my stepdad is a creep and im uncomfortable around him, this is a whole different story) when these things started continuing, my mother laughing at every single thing that had to do with B, LITERALLY EVERYTHING!!! i could even just mention her name in a story and she starts smiling. not only has this been annoying i also feel like my moms replacing me with her, sometimes i feel like she wish she had B as a daughter instead of me as a son. i dont know how to tell them this bothers me or if i even should  but the most recent situation taht happened about an hour ago has proven this is still happening and maybe getting worse. so my mom really loves her job like loves it, it causes her so much stress, she hates the people and the kids (she works as a teacher in an elementary school) she constantly complaines (she refuses to quit because it was her first job and she met my stepdad there ((MY 2ND FUCKING GRADE TEACHER!)). while married to my dad too!! homewrecker alert!) but she takes her being on time to work very seriously (although shes late to EVERYTHING) so this morning my mom offered to drive me and B to school and get starbucks on the way, of course B jumped at this opportunity, so my mom drove me to Bs house, ten minutes later than we agreed (cause my moms always late) when i got there B had just woke up, i waited for about five minutes and then went to go tell my mom (who was waiting in the car outside) to tell her B just woke up and when i told her this she heard Bs name and smiled then her smiled faded and she replied with ""Oh, so I'm just driving you"" with a frown on her face and a sad tone, like she was actually excited to drive her and not me... but B got ready quick and we were able to leave and get starbucks. later once we go to school my mom asked where to drop us off and i said the front of the school, cause thats closer to where my class is, and B said the other side of the school where her class is, and my mom drove to where B wanted to get dropped and refused to drive to the front and wouldn't tell me why, we got there one minute before the bell rang because B was late, and B got to her class on time while i was counted tardy because i had to walk all the way to the other side of the school (our school is huge by the way, not small at all) before this i thought i could get over it or just ignore them but now my moms started to prioritize Bs education over mine. 

I also need to say that i have another really close friend whos often with me, lets call them T (15FTNB) and my mom hates them for no reason, she never laughs at their jokes, doesn't invite them over, never talks about them and when i ask if they can come over, my mom always gets annoyed at me for just asking, (whenever i ask if B can come over she gets really happy and never declines) and just acts like it's inconvenient to have them around, i genuinely dont understand why, T is an amazing person, has been nothing but nice to my mom, always says please and thank you, never asks to buy stuff when we're out because they feel bad, and theyre just one of my best friends. T has also noticed that B is a little too close with my mom and its a little weird to be around them.
(B is also really good friends with T, so we often hang out all three of us)

My parents have split custody  of me and my dads (38M) opinion on this is its really weird for my mom to be this close to B, because hes seen my mom drive B home from school events where I need to leave with my dad, my mom always seems really excited to drive her and always volunteers too. My dad doesn't have any opinions of my friends because he thinks its highly inappropriate for an adult to be friends with children.

Im sorry this is so long but this is something thats been bothering me for about three years now, i love B and T so much and i wanna know if this is something worth talking to them about or if im just being an annoying, self absorbed, immature kid. (and if this behavior is inappropriate)
 
also note that my mom has a manipulative personality, whenever she doesnt wanna talk about something she just doesn't answer what i ask or respond to what i say, she is a very passive speaker and doesn't think about other people often.

1hinc6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hinc6d/what_is_the_tourist_strip_in_miami/,What is the tourist strip in Miami?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience exploring Miami's famous tourist strip and help those planning to visit this vibrant city. After spending several weeks here, I've gotten pretty familiar with the area and discovered some amazing spots that I think you'll love.

The main tourist strip in Miami is essentially Ocean Drive, running parallel to South Beach. It's this incredibly lively stretch that perfectly captures Miami's essence - think art deco buildings, palm trees, and that perfect beach view. But there's way more to it than just that.

The strip actually extends beyond Ocean Drive to include Collins Avenue and Washington Avenue, creating this triangle of awesome entertainment and activities. During my time here, I've found that each street has its own unique vibe.

Ocean Drive is definitely the heart of it all. It's where you'll find those iconic pastel-colored art deco buildings you've probably seen on Instagram. During the day, it's perfect for people-watching while sipping Cuban coffee at one of the sidewalk cafes. At night, it transforms into this energetic scene with restaurants spilling onto the sidewalks and music filling the air.

I've tried quite a few activities in the area, and honestly, the best way to experience everything is through guided tours. I found this great website (https://athometouch.com/miami) that offers various tours and activities - it's how I discovered some hidden gems I wouldn't have found otherwise.

Collins Avenue is more upscale, with luxury hotels and high-end shopping. If you're into fashion, you'll love the boutiques here. Washington Avenue is more laid-back, with local shops and some really authentic Cuban restaurants.

One thing I learned is that the tourist strip isn't just about the beaches (though they're amazing). There's this whole cultural aspect with the Art Deco Historic District, local art galleries, and some fascinating architecture tours. The area between 5th and 15th streets is particularly interesting - it's like an open-air museum of 1930s architecture.

If you're planning to visit, I'd definitely recommend checking out some organized tours through https://athometouch.com/miami. They offer everything from food tours to art deco walking tours, and it's a great way to learn about the area's history while having fun.

Some tips from my experience:
- Early mornings are perfect for beach walks and photos
- Late afternoons are great for shopping
- Evenings are best for dining and entertainment
- Weekends are super busy, so plan accordingly
- Don't forget to explore the side streets - they often have great local spots

The tourist strip is really the beating heart of Miami Beach, and there's something here for everyone. Whether you're into architecture, food, shopping, or just want to soak up the sun, you'll find your groove here. Just remember to bring plenty of sunscreen and your camera - you're gonna need both!

On Oct 1, me and the man I love broke up because he had not returned my calls in three weeks and I had not seen him. When he told me that his family was sick I did not trust him and so he left me.
I did everything that you should not do. Go to his house, text him from different numbers and call him off private calls after he blocked my number.
He told me initially that we could try friends within two weeks but I did not want to wait that long.
Eventually he was almost at the point of filing a restraining order because I got a bunch of messages from his ex girlfriend that were racist and then I got mad and told all his friends and his stepmother about the messages.
But he still did not do it.
I was extremely heartbroken.
You may be thinking this guy is a shitty person but at one point he loved me more than I loved him and I ruined it with my actions.
So I accepted defeat. But still did not give up.
I was in contact with his friends and one of his ex girlfriends who he still talks to and that his stepmother is fond of. His stepmother despises me because I dated one of his friends before him who was a douchebag and still is. And because I am friends with people she does not approve of. She is very controlling. 
The ex girlfriend begged him to unblock me and talk to me and at least try to be friends on Nov 24. It took over a month. 
When he unblocked me and asked how I was the conversation went very well. It was over text but still good.
About ten days later I called him and he was happy to talk to me.
Since then we have been texting consistently. I initiate most of the conversations but he answers back almost within a few hours if not right away.
A few days ago I told him that I missed him and that I wanted to see him in a public place. A coffee shop. He agreed and wanted to meet this Tuesday but unfortunately something came up on his end and we have been trying to reschedule. 
My advice guys is be patient. It worked for me.
The reason I got this far is because six months before I noticed him he had a crush on me, and he was the one to initiate the first kiss. When we were together he posted new pictures of us every day. If it had been me who was more in love with him than the other way around I would not have gotten this far.
From thinking I would lose him forever to at the very least being friends. And I have not stopped hoping for more. He doesn't know this. But I do.
So right now I'm trying to get us that meeting at a coffee shop.
I hope my story helps. ",1,1734711307.0,BreakUps,0,0.99,False
