1m9m38u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TotalHipReplacement/comments/1m9m38u/day_one_and_two_post_op/,Day One and Two post op,"So having had a lateral right hip replacement on Thursday morning at the age of 53, I learned that the day of the op is counted as day zero. 

I went into the process with a very positive attitude. The spinal caused less discomfort than the canula in my hand, which was a surprise, and the op was an education as I’d been asked not to have sedation in response to a proclivity for low O2 as a result of sleep apnea and some intermittent anaemia. 

Anyways, after a somewhat energetic day zero walking up and down hospital corridors and up and down stairs I was discharged by physio and the anaesthetist six hours after surgery. However I stayed overnight as the pharmacy hadn’t got my discharge medication ready. 

Day one - I had a relatively relaxed night. Minor pain which was easily addressed with the 2 hourly doses or morphine. I was stiff in the morning and found the getting in and out of bed momentarily more difficult but the moment I was up and walking after just five or six steps the fluidity of movement returned. This compared very positively with my usual morning stiffness and though there was a little pain (maybe 2 out of 10) the smoothness of my movements was noticeably improved from my pre op walking (albeit using two crutches. 

I was able to shower and having got my meds I went home. 

I visited my parents who live next door and who have had both his replaced. The first thing they noticed was how easily I got in and out of a chair. Not gingerly testing the joint or showing pain but simply sitting down and leaning forward to pet the dog. 

They were incredulous at how easily I moved and the advice from the physio that I could return to the gym immediately with some obvious restrictions on what I did there. 

Back home I did a little light housework, made some lunch and coffee and noticed my primary worry (navigating the stairs up and down) had not been necessary. It was easier due to the handrail. 

By bedtime, and having pottered about the house most of the day using just one crutch (it felt I was able to walk more fluidly than the stop start I experienced using two) my leg felt heavy as I got into bed but very comfortable. I took the various pain meds so I wouldn’t wake in the night and slept for about 5 hours pain free. 

Day two 
I woke and forgot I’d had surgery. Trying to get out of bed the stiffness in my right hip reminded me. 

However, still in a bit of a daze I got to the bedroom door before realising I should be using a crutch. Not because of pain but a feeling of instability. Having rectified that I went downstairs, had my morning coffee and planned my gym routine for 11am. 

I’m going to pick up that experience as a separate post after I’ve been. 

However, and I appreciate everyone is different, I do believe attitude plays a huge part. I was in an enhanced care unit and my ward mate was a lady in her 80’s who had had a knee replacement. She was scheduled for a five day stay, had her op directly after mine via the same surgeon and was told to expect a five day stay. 

Having seen me trotting up and down the ward when the physio came to see her she stunned them by also walking much further than expected. She said that watching me try and talking through how to keep going and the focus on getting as much early movement had really spurred her on (to the point she asked for a race). As I was leaving and I went to say goodbye she was getting the news she also was able to be discharged four days early. She was delighted. 

I know pride comes before a fall, and I am destined for the occasional bad day, but I really feel that my viewing this whole experience as an exciting challenge has put me in the best starting position possible. 

I’ve nobody at home with me and for those in a similar position all I can say is don’t worry. Just plan ahead. A little batch cooking for the freezer or simple things to pop in the air fryer and the rest is just a series of little challeges. 

As I sit on a bar stool in my kitchen writing this the pain is 0/10. I know as I get up I’ll have a second or two where its around 2/10 and some awkwardness on the first one or two steps but I’m delighted with the whole experience so far.

I am 35 now.

I don’t plan to touch the money until 2045.

Will I be able to survive my retirement time worry free, if I just add may be 10k per month (adjusting 8-10 percent peryear) to this and my PF fund would also continue?

I am a frugal and simple living person. Not into any heavy cash invested hobby. A filter coffee at morning and some hobby coding projects and gardening may get me going.

Wont this suffice my life, or am I missing something? I get anxious when I hear toouch numbers from finfluencers.

- Anxiety. General anxiety, but currently, a lot of this is due to work. It's so bad I tend to freeze and get panic attacks when I'm faced with work that I dread, or before meetings with my boss

- ADD/ADHD type issues

- Inability to focus on tasks for meaningfully long periods. I have lost the ability to read books or even watch anything more than half an hour long on Netflix

- A feeling of being constantly overwhelmed and overstimulated. I'm struggling with time management

- I need help with caffeine, junk food, and phone addiction too. I am literally addicted to coffee and to my phone. I will try and eat healthy, but often binge eat chips too

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on called Onyx for Theatres. It’s a small accessibility-focused device designed to make the moviegoing experience more comfortable and inclusive for people who are sensitive to loud sounds, certain pitches, or sensory overload.

The idea is simple:

Volume Control: Each person can adjust their own audio level without affecting anyone else.

Pitch Filtering: It can reduce specific sound frequencies that might cause discomfort.

Inclusive Experience: It works alongside other accessibility options theatres already provide, like closed-captioning devices or descriptive audio headsets.

This project is really personal to me. I love movies, but I know for a lot of people, myself included (though to a much smaller degree than some), movies may not be super accessible due to sound sensitivities affecting those who may have things like ASD, ADHD, Tinnitus, or Hyperacusis.

Right now, I’m in the initial prototyping stage and working on getting the hardware built. To keep things moving, I’m also trying to raise some funding to cover the costs of components and development. If you’d like to help support the project, you can do so through Buy Me a Coffee (coff.ee/minodab492). Even small contributions make a big difference.

If you’re curious, you can read more about the project and roadmap here:

## Key Features Analysis

The Lildy Leggings distinguish themselves through a combination of innovative design and high-quality materials.

**fabric Blend:** The core of Lildy Leggings lies in their unique fabric blend, typically composed of a combination of nylon, polyester, and spandex.The specific ratios might vary between different lines, but the overall goal remains consistent: to deliver a comfortable, supportive, and durable product. The nylon provides a smooth and almost silky feel against the skin, while the polyester contributes to moisture-wicking capabilities and long-term shape retention. The addition of spandex ensures a four-way stretch, offering maximum adaptability and freedom of movement.

**High-Waisted Design:** A defining characteristic of most Lildy Leggings is their high-waisted design, extending several inches above the natural waistline. This feature provides not only a flattering silhouette but also offers gentle compression around the midsection, creating a slimming effect and enhancing body confidence.The high waistband also eliminates the risk of slippage during physical activity, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit throughout your workout or daily routine.**Flatlock Seams:** To minimize chafing and irritation, Lildy Leggings incorporate flatlock seams. This construction technique involves stitching the fabric panels together in a way that creates a smooth, flat surface, rather than raised edges. This thoughtful design element drastically reduces friction against the skin, making the leggings ideal for high-intensity activities such as running, yoga, or cross-training. Moreover, the flatlock seams contribute to the leggings' overall durability, preventing premature wear and tear.

**Hidden Pocket(s):** Recognizing the need for convenient storage,many Lildy Leggings incorporate hidden pocket(s),often located in the waistband or along the side of the leg. These pockets are typically large enough to accommodate a smartphone, keys, or small wallet, allowing you to keep essential items close at hand without the need for a bulky bag. the discreet design ensures that the pockets remain inconspicuous, maintaining the leggings' sleek and streamlined appearance.

**Reinforced Gusset:** A reinforced gusset, typically a diamond-shaped panel of fabric sewn into the crotch area, is a crucial feature for enhancing comfort and mobility. This gusset allows for a wider range of motion and prevents the leggings from riding up or bunching, particularly during dynamic movements. The added reinforcement also contributes to the leggings' overall durability, reducing the risk of seam failure in a high-stress area.

**Moisture-Wicking Technology:** Staying dry and comfortable is paramount during physical activity, and Lildy Leggings address this need with their moisture-wicking technology. The fabric is engineered to draw sweat away from the skin, allowing it to evaporate quickly and efficiently. This helps regulate body temperature and prevent that uncomfortable,sticky feeling that can accompany intense workouts. The moisture-wicking properties also contribute to the leggings' overall hygiene,reducing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.

It'd be even better if they were of the geometric sort/art deco/contemporary style, but a whole historical stained glass bible would be okay too! The most important aspect of the book is that it has \*a lot\* of colored images of wonderful pieces so they are able to look back at the book for color pairing inspiration for what they are trying to make. (They're great with designs but have a hard time envisioning what the glass will look like when paired)

I've been hunting and hunting and there seems to be a lot of stained glass books out there, but as I'm searching online I'm unable to look inside most of them! I'm not looking for a pattern book either, but something that is a photographic collection of pieces! Think a coffee table book, or a something like a stained glass image bible.

Not going to lie. Feedbask started off as one of those “Hey, this shouldn’t be this hard, right?” moments.

Me and my co-founder? We were just tired. Tired of using four different tools. Tired of bug reports stuck in back-and-forth emails, feature requests lost to the ether, and customer feedback...never making it to our roadmap.

So we did what builders do: we scratched our own itch.

Fast forward to today:  
It’s called [Feedbask.com](https://www.feedbask.com/)

What’s different?  
✅ One widget to rule them all: feature requests, bug reports, NPS surveys, reviews all in one place  
✅ No code (seriously, 3 minute install)  
✅ Shareable roadmap your users will actually check  
✅ Never chase missing context again every bug, every suggestion, every piece of feedback lands in your dashboard with all the details you need

Built for SaaS founders, indie hackers, and anyone tired of guessing what users want.

My favorite part?  
→ Free forever plan.  
→ Set up in the time it takes to make coffee  
→ You’ll know if it clicks in 5 minutes. (No CC required.)

We’re not “revolutionizing feedback.” We’re just making it finally...simple.

This lineup is hands-down the most unhinged selection I’ve ever seen in one place.

These are *not* your everyday bags. We’re talking:

* **Experimental fermentation methods**: thermal shock, fruit maceration, co-ferments, lager-yeast ferments—stuff that sounds like it belongs in a brewery, not a roastery
* **Varietals for days**: Geshas, Sudans, Mokkas, Pink Bourbons, even some freakish Sidra/Wush Wush hybrids
* **Flavor notes** that go from classic to unhinged: saffron, banana candy, cherry cola, jasmine, mango sticky rice, oolong tea, marshmallow, and “spritz”

It’s like every producer decided to drop their most experimental nano-lots at once. Some were competition coffees, others are just off-the-wall processing experiments from producers with too much creativity and not enough chill.

You’ll see:

* Funky naturals that taste like dessert
* Washed lots with insane clarity and florals
* Wild blends that somehow work (and some that shouldn’t, but do)
* A few super clean, delicate Geshas that will break your heart (and maybe your wallet)

No gatekeeping—this stuff is limited but not impossible to grab. If you're a flavor chaser, a processing nerd, or just want to see what coffee is capable of *outside* the normal box… this is it.",5,1753508814.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False

His blue shirt, that faded old thing, lost its form fiber by fiber, radiating away from his rapidly degrading torso like wisps of dry ice on a hot summer day. Bob's last sensation was his own heart stopping, its cells forgetting how to hold together and bursting into pools of fluids, fats, and protein.

Across the universe, the vast cosmic filaments that connected galaxy clusters began to fray like torn rope. The spiral arms of the Milky Way spun away. Stars blinked out of existence. Reality tore like fabric, and through the tears poured infinite nothingness.

Space exploded like a coiled spring. A single photon sparked into existence, then another, then cascades of them, painting possibility across the darkness.

The first stars weren't born, they were composed, their cores igniting in perfect symphony. Hydrogen sang itself into existence, then helium, then the whole periodic table manifesting element by element in harmony.

Gravity returned, gathering the scattered star stuff into worlds. Solar systems assembled themselves with clockwork precision. Gas giants reclaimed their territories, and moons rediscovered their elliptical orbits. On a pale blue dot, continents drifted into their familiar configurations. Civilizations materialized complete with their histories, their languages, and their dreams.

The universe had been remade, identical in every detail to what had come before.

Almost.

The change had been simple: One tiny alteration to the universe's fundamental properties, propagated through every particle, every wave function, every possible outcome. The old reality had been garbage-collected into the void. The new reality, identical except for one chromatic detail, had been rendered in its stead.

1m9lkfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1m9lkfl/previous_wpw_diagnosis_possible_residual_problems/,Previous WPW diagnosis- possible residual problems?,"Hi everyone,

When I was in third grade, I was running home from a friend’s house because it was getting dark. When I got home, I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded, seeing stars, and had a migraine along with nausea. At the time, my stepdad was a cardiology nurse, and when he checked my heart rate, it was 220 bpm. He rushed me to the ER, where in the days following, I was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). I was put on a heart monitor and scheduled for surgery a couple of weeks later. I underwent a cardiac ablation, which went well, and at the time, it was believed that the condition had been fully corrected. After that, I didn’t have any further issues throughout the rest of my childhood and wasn’t placed on any medication.

Now, fast forward to when I was 21, in 2010. I had surgery for a breast augmentation, and when I woke up, the nurse told me that I needed to see a cardiologist because my heart was going to fail. Apparently, my heart rate was 140 while I was under anesthesia during the surgery. So I got ahold of my then-former stepdad- my mom had passed away- and he connected me with a cardiologist. They requested my medical records from the children’s hospital and at that point, the assumption was that the node (or whatever it is that they ablate to remove the pathway- again, I was in 3rd grade and my mom is gone so things aren’t amazingly clear) had been successfully ablated when I was in third grade, but maybe as my heart grew, that spot had reappeared and needed to be ablated again.

So, I had the operation, and during the surgery, they shocked my heart for longer than what’s considered safe in an attempt to set off the Wolff-Parkinson-White episode so they could locate the area to ablate. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to trigger it successfully, so they had to wake me up without making any corrections as they had hoped. At that point in 2010, I was basically told: don’t work out, don’t drink coffee, and just be really careful not to get your heart rate up.

I just continued on with my life. As far as I know, I’ve never had any episodes again, and I’ve never been on any medication. They considered putting me on beta blockers, but they just made me feel sedated, so I never stuck with them. I do drink coffee every morning, and I’ve worked out since, excessively for several years. I don’t really want to live my life in fear, but I guess the fact that I’m still thinking about it means I kind of do. I’ve always wondered whether I still have Wolff-Parkinson-White or if it might be a different, undiagnosed heart issue as I’ve heard WPW is extremely rare. I sometimes wonder if what happened during surgery at 21 was just a fluke- maybe my heart rate was elevated for some other reason, and I don’t actually still have WPW, especially since they weren’t able to locate or correct anything during that procedure. My heart rate tends to run high- my resting heart rate is usually in the high 80s or 90s. And sometimes, after a night of drinking, even if I’m just sitting on the couch, my heart rate can be around 130 for no real reason (other than the obvious- alcohol). I just got in from a 20 min walk w my dog and my heart rate is 105. I’ve had a few EKG’s over the years for unrelated things/ operations and no one has ever flagged anything abnormal. I’m a pretty healthy female- I don’t smoke, I rarely drink, I’m active and slim, but I’ve always wondered if there’s something more going on with my heart and I’m a ticking time bomb since they left things unresolved?

I don’t have insurance. I’ve been a realtor for most of my adult life, and before that, I was a cocktail server, so I’ve never really had consistent access to health insurance. My second surgery, when I was 21, was paid for out of pocket by my sister. So I haven’t really been able to explore what might still be going on with my heart- if anything- because I just can’t afford to see a cardiologist and do a bunch of exploration without insurance.

I guess I’ve always kind of felt like I was going to die young. Although neither from heart issues, my mom died young, and so did my grandma, and that’s always been a lingering fear- that my heart is just going to give out, or I’ll have a heart attack or something. So I’m here looking for advice. I’d love to hear from someone who’s a cardiologist, or has medical experience, on whether it sounds like my heart might be normal now, or if it still sounds like I might have Wolff-Parkinson-White, or maybe if my symptoms line up with something else entirely.

I don’t regularly have any obvious heart issues. Occasionally, I’ll feel what might be an irregular beat or a flutter, but nothing extreme- I assume something very minimal and occasional like that is normal. For the most part, I don’t really notice my heart unless my heart rate spikes- like during hard exercise or after a night of drinking occasionally.

I’m just a regular student, not some expert or anything. I was super stressed last semester. You know that feeling when like, 3 essays are due in the same week and your brain is just… gone? Yeah. That was me.

So I googled “essay writing service” like any panicking student would, and **MyPerfectWords** popped up. The site looked kinda okay, lots of promises like “top writers” and “plagiarism free” and all that jazz. I was like, “Hmm... this sounds too perfect.” But I was desperate.

# So... I gave it a shot.

I ordered a 5-page essay on climate change. Paid around 50 bucks (yeah, ouch). They said I’d get it in 2 days. Cool. So I waited.

# Here’s what actually happened:

* The essay came *right* on time. So, +1 for that.
* It was readable… like, it wasn’t totally trash. But also… not great.
* A lot of it felt copy-pasted. Not straight from websites, but kinda generic. Like ChatGPT wrote it while half-asleep.
* I ran it through Grammarly and a plagiarism checker. It had a few red flags. Nothing huge, but enough to freak me out a bit.
* I asked for a revision. They said okay, but the revision was... basically the same thing with 2 sentences moved around 😒

# Would I use it again?

Honestly… no. It *wasn’t* a total scam, so I guess **yes, it’s “legit”** in the sense that they deliver *something*. But is it good? Meh. Not really.

I feel like it’s more of a gamble. If you’re hoping for an A+, don’t count on it. If you’re just trying to submit *something* to avoid a zero, then maybe it’ll do.

* **Is MyPerfectWords legit?** Technically, yes.
* **Would I recommend it?** Only if you’re desperate.
* **Did I get my money’s worth?** Eh… not really.

There are better ways to spend your money (like food... or coffee... or literally anything else). Next time, I’m just gonna try finishing it myself and maybe ask a friend to proofread.

1m9liok,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1m9liok/new_orleans_open_container_laws_can_you_drink_in/,New Orleans Open Container Laws: Can You Drink in Public in New Orleans?,"# 🍹 The Truth About Public Drinking in New Orleans - What Every Travel Trotter Should Know 🎭

Hey fellow Travel Trotters! Just got back from my third trip to NOLA and thought I'd share the REAL deal about those famous open container laws everyone talks about. Because yes, it's true - you CAN drink in public in New Orleans, and it's glorious!

## Laissez les bon temps rouler! 🎉

New Orleans embraces its ""let the good times roll"" philosophy like nowhere else in America. Walking down Bourbon Street with a Hurricane cocktail isn't just allowed - it's practically a rite of passage! 

I remember my first visit being absolutely mind-blown watching people casually strolling around with drinks. Coming from [insert restrictive city], it felt almost rebellious despite being perfectly legal!

## The Rules You Actually Need to Know 👮‍♀️

Despite the relaxed vibe, there ARE rules. Miss these and you could still end up with a citation:

**The Plastic Rule is REAL** - Your drink MUST be in a plastic container. No glass, no cans. Every bar knows this and will happily pour your drink into a plastic go-cup if you're heading out. Don't try to be slick with a beer can or glass - that's the fastest way to get stopped.

**Public Intoxication is Still a No-Go** - Yes, you can drink, but no, you can't be falling-down drunk. The cops generally won't bother anyone having a good time, but if you're causing a scene or clearly hammered, they'll intervene.

**Respect the Neighborhoods** - The French Quarter isn't the only place you can enjoy this freedom, but some residential areas might give you side-eye. Read the room (or street) and be respectful.

## The Famous Drive-Thru Daiquiris 🍹🚗

One of my favorite NOLA quirks! These drive-thru daiquiri shops exploit the most hilarious loophole: as long as the straw hasn't been inserted through the lid, it's considered a ""closed container"" and thus legal to have in your car (though the driver obviously shouldn't be drinking).

The first time I saw one, I literally made my Uber driver pull over so I could take a picture. It's such a uniquely New Orleans thing!

## Beyond Bourbon Street 🎺

While tourists flock to Bourbon Street with their Hand Grenades and Huge Ass Beers (yes, that's a real drink name!), locals know that enjoying a beverage extends to many parts of the city:

- **Frenchmen Street** is more laid-back with amazing live jazz and fewer crowds
- **Garden District** strolls with a discreet cocktail are lovely
- **City Park** picnics often include wine or local brews

During my last trip, I joined some locals for a bike bar crawl through Bywater and Marigny with drinks in our bike cup holders. Totally legal and a fantastic way to see neighborhoods tourists often miss!

## Festival Culture & Public Drinking 🎭

If you're lucky enough to visit during Jazz Fest, French Quarter Fest, or (the ultimate) Mardi Gras, public drinking reaches new heights. These events are designed around the concept of wandering, drinking, and enjoying music/parades.

Pro tip: The ""no glass"" rule is enforced even MORE during festivals. I saw someone get their wine bottle confiscated during Jazz Fest last year, despite being otherwise well-behaved.

## The Cultural Context 🥂

What makes New Orleans special isn't just the legal ability to carry drinks - it's the entire culture around public socializing. Drinking here isn't about getting wasted; it's part of the social fabric.

When you see locals sitting on their porches with cocktails, waving to neighbors passing by with their own drinks, you understand this isn't just a tourist gimmick - it's a way of life that emphasizes community and celebration.

## My Favorite NOLA Drinking Experiences 💫

After multiple visits, here are some must-try public drinking experiences:

- Getting a frozen Irish Coffee from Erin Rose and sipping it while wandering through the antique shops on Royal Street
- Grabbing a beer from a corner store and enjoying it during a free concert in Lafayette Square
- Taking a go-cup cocktail from a fancy restaurant to continue the evening elsewhere (totally normal behavior here!)
- Bringing a drink to the Mississippi Riverfront at sunset

## Ready to Experience NOLA? ✈️

If all this talk of freely wandering with delicious cocktails has you itching to plan a trip, I've been using this amazing tool for finding killer deals on flights to New Orleans: [https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H](https://aviasales.tp.st/es2CXj4H)

I scored my last NOLA flight for nearly 40% off regular prices! Definitely worth checking before you book.

## Final Thoughts from a Fellow Trotter 🧳

New Orleans' open container laws are a refreshing departure from the typical American approach to public drinking. Rather than creating problems, this freedom actually seems to create a more convivial, relaxed atmosphere.

Just remember to:
- Keep it plastic
- Stay reasonably sober
- Respect the locals
- Dispose of your cups properly

I’m posting this to ask for help; I got this bite yesterday and I’m not sure what bit me. For context, I live in the state of Tamaulipas, México, specifically in the Tampico/Altamira area which is violinist & brown recluse range.

So, as you can imagine, I’m a bit worried! I typically get eaten alive by mosquitos and fire ants, but this definitely doesn’t look mosquito to me. Additionally, I’m only aware of jumping spider species in my area and not sure what other arachnids there are [I tried looking online, but it kept feeding me br & v stories which only made my anxiety worse].

The bite is a bit red because, yes, I’ve scratched it about two times before realizing it looked sorta different from a mosquito bite. Got it yesterday around ~5pm, it is currently 11pm and I took the picture just now.

I don’t notice any numbness in the area, and I am nauseous but that’s probably [hopefully?] because I had caffeinated coffee [which I’m not supposed to have].

I have not sought out medical help because it’s a long drive away, and because I only noticed today that it looked funny. If you guys recommend I go to a clinic, it will have to be until tomorrow but I promise I WILL go. Only other ""different"" spider I have seen [to jumping spiders, I mean] is one that looked pretty similar to a yellow sac, but was brownish; it, however, had shorter legs than what I’ve seen brown recluses have [in pictures] and had a chubbier abdomen. Even so, I’m terribly scared.

What's going on?","I just had milk and cereal with full confidence that it will not make me sick. It's a late night ""I can't sleep, break in case of insomnia"" snack for me. I put milk and creamer in my matcha and coffee, drink yogurt, etc. I'm not lactose intolerant and nobody in my family is. 

HOWEVER!

Having butter- even cooking with it- will make my stomach ache and burn all day, and I'll have brain fog and anxiety. I'm burping up acid for hours after eating butter or a sauce with butter in it. No other cooking fat does this to me in regular quantities (except beef tallow/marbled steak. I get sick with that too, but that's rarely consumed if ever.) I spread margarine (the kind without trans fats, yes it exists!) on my bagel in the morning with no issue. I cook pretty much everything with a bit of olive oil with no issue what so ever. Ghee makes me feel slightly less bad but I've learned to avoid it as well because I still get a (less intense) gut issue when I eat it first thing with my bagel or toast. 

Some more context- I had chronic lymes disease during 2020 and was instructed to consume antibiotics and probiotics at the same time. I had a bacterial bloom in my stomach shortly after that wrecked me for years. I'm just now fixing it with kefir and can eat most things again after being stuck a low FODMAP diet. Butter is still.. weird for me. I don't know what it is with butter specifically that my body rejects. I avoid it as much as possible, but because I live in the culinary hell that is America it's bound to sneak into some dish at some point. (Like my trader joe's frozen pasta this evening :( )

Anyone else experience this? Any solutions? I'm fine living without butter, I just don't want to be sick as hell after eating it by accident. (Before you say ""go to the doctor,"" I already went.

1m9ld9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m9ld9y/the_ravens_are_hungry_part_3/,The Ravens are Hungry Part 3,"I awoke in a cold sweat looking around in panic and confusion. Someone had been calling my name. Was it Isaac? How could it be Isaac? Has he been found? I jumped out of bed to check the time it was 4:00pm. It was getting dark outside and the cold November air bit into my skin as I moved to the door of my bedroom. Why is it cold? Was a door open?

I quietly opened my bedroom door and looked down the hall. All the lights were out and it was colder now. As I opened the door fully I smelled it. The stench, the stench of the prison. The stench of Death. I slammed the door quickly and as soon as I did I heard something run down the hall toward my door slamming into it seconds after it closed. I braced my body against the door expecting more impacts against the door. Nothing. With one arm I grabbed a chair sitting by my desk and slammed it under the handle doing my best to barricade the door.

As I moved to drag my dresser in front of the door I heard a voice from the other side of the door. Low and raspy

“*My Ravens are Hungry*” It whispered

“Who’s There!” I demanded as I pushed the dresser into the door and grabbed a baseball bat that was sitting in the corner of my room.

“I’m armed!” I added with a shaky voice The voice changed into a familiar laugh.

“Really man what are you going to do beat me to death with a pillow or something?”

“Isaac?” I asked as I rushed towards the door “What happened? How did you get here? Where’s Jake and Mario? What's going on?  
He laughed again.

“Well if you promise not to kill me and open the door then I can explain it all.”

“I can’t believe it” I said as I dropped the bat and started to pull the dresser away from the door.

“Where have you....?” I trailed off as a noise came from outside my window. Click Click. Click Click. Click Click. A train car. Coming down the tracks behind my house.  
I hurriedly pushed the dresser back into place suspecting something was not right.

“Who did I have a crush on in 10th grade?” I asked picking my bat back up

“What? Why would that matter? Let me in.” he said, shaking the door handle and putting weight against the door.

“Who?” I demanded, never taking my eyes off the door.

“I don’t Know man, how am I supposed to remember?”  
It did matter. At least it had to the real Isaac. In tenth grade Isaac had not spoken to me for 6 months because I had a crush on his little sister who was the grade below us. Whatever was on the other side of my bedroom door, It wasn’t Isaac.

“Go away.” I said

“What it’s m*e ma*n. L*et* m*e in.”* It said its voice cutting in and out of Isaacs and a low raspy croak as if it was losing Isaacs voice.

“Why should...?” I started to say  
I was interrupted by a loud thud against the door followed by a scratching noise as the thing ran its finger nails along the outside of my door. I backed away from the door shaking as I heard it whisper over and over.

“*My Ravens are Hungry...My Ravens are Hungry....My Ravens are Hungry.”*  
The Image of the body I had seen flashed through my mind. The flesh on the neck and face that had been peeled and torn off. The scalp torn and bloodied. The eyes.  
The thing stayed for what felt like forever. I huddled in a corner hoping that it would just go away.

Tap...Tap...Tap...I woke up with a start. The Raven finishing his pattern flew off into the night.  
It was fully dark now.The Scratching had stopped. I Looked at the clock. 12:00am. What? I thought as I shakily tried to stand up clutching the bat as if my life depended on it. It was 4:00pm when that...thing had come. Had it been here that long? Was it still there? Where did it go? As my mind raced I heard it. Click Click. Click Click. Click Click. The train Car. I crept to the window overlooking the rail line that ran behind our house. The car was moving away from my house into the darkness of the night. As it disappeared I saw a black hooded figure standing at the front of it staring up at my window. I continued to stare and as I did I saw the thing that sent a deep dread through my entire body. There hanging from the cross beam swaying slightly with the movement of the cart were two bodies. I knew who they were. It was too dark to be sure, but I knew. Jake and Mario would not be coming home. I continued to watch as the car disappeared into the darkness. I stared for a long time. I didn’t know what to do.

I sat in the police station parking lot and stared at my steering wheel debating in my head.  
I had been awake for the rest of the night and in the morning had decided to go to the police for help. But what to tell them? I thought as I got out of my car. The Truth? No, they would think I’m crazy. Tell them about the man? Have them make their own conclusions?  
Still unsure, I walked into the front office and asked for officer Bradley.  
As I was led to an interview room I made a decision.

“So you mentioned you may know something.” said Officer Bradley as he sat down across from me with the same file he had yesterday.

“Maybe” I said nervously “Did you ever go to the old prison?” Officer Bradley looked up from the file giving a short laugh and saying.

“Like as a Grad dare?”  
I nodded looking up to meet his gaze

“No I never did, however a bunch of my friends did. Not sure how far they got though. Why do you ask?”

“Well....” I hesitated. “Me, Isaec, Mario and Jake all visited there before the summer...and Isaec disappeared near there and so he possibly could have gone there for some reason.”

“Did you encounter anybody?” Officer Bradley as he pulled a notebook from the pocket on his vest.

“Sort of...We saw someone but ran before getting a good look at him. We all thought it was a homeless guy or something.”  
“Could he have done something to do with your friends disappearing, do you think?” “Maybe...” I said fidgeting a bit.

Officer Bradley looked at me as he scribbled some notes.  
“Ok well take a look at the old prison. Can you come with us to show us where you guys

went?”  
I hesitated, I didn’t want to go back to that dreadful place and after last night I knew I wouldn’t be saving my friends. But I knew I would be next to swing from those gallows and I wanted this thing stopped before then.

“Ok I can” I said reluctantly

“Right wait here I’ll gather a few officers to join us and we can head out. Do you need any coffee or water?” He asked as he got up. I politely declined, my head spinning with the thought of going back to the horrid place.

Before I knew it I was in a car beside Officer Bradley with 5 other cars following behind as we drove towards the service road that got us closets to the prison.  
My stomach churned as we drove trying my best to listen to Officer Bradleys small talk to distract myself yet to no avail.

Before I knew it we were stopping on a pullout and all piling out of the cars.  
“We will have to walk from here” Said officer Bradley as he opened his trunk and pulled a

small pack from it as well as a shotgun checking to see if it was loaded.

“Can’t be too careful, There's a lot of bears out here” he said as I eyed the weapon. I nodded, it wasn't bears I was worried about. I looked at the other officers. They were all doing the same. One even had a hunting style rifle with a scope, I hoped it would be enough.

We walked for a little while up the road before coming to the tracks that lead to the prison. We continued to walk as a group watching our surroundings as we continued on.  
Before long we came to the bend in the tracks that turned towards the prison.

“How far did you guys make it in?” asked one of the officers.

“There...there seemed to be a second level to the basement.....I...think we made it there.” I answered stuttering as we rounded the bend to face the gaping black hole jutting out from the building.

“Huh....Made it farther than we did.” Muttered the officer looking at his coworker who smirked.

“Ya and who’s fault was that? the second officer answered, swinging around and making a look at the officer with the rifle.

“Hey...we were 17.....and... I thought I saw something...”

“Is that why you ran screaming?” quipped Officer Bradley  
They all laughed at their colleague as he stumbled for an excuse.  
As we entered through the train entrance into the prison a group of ravens circled high above awaiting there meal.

As we walked into the main area shining our flashlights around the officers began to call out for my friends. I cringed as there voices echoed through the building.

“I don’t think they are here...” I started “ They..”  
I was interrupted by a massive bang deep within the tunnel that had been blocked by rubble...before “***it***” had gotten out. A shiver ran down my spine as we all turned our lights into the darkness.

“Police who’s there?” Officer Bradley called out taking the shotgun off his shoulder and clipping the flashlight to the end. The other officers followed suit. I stepped back as the officers moved forward.  
As the officers moved closer to the tunnel I heard it. Click Click. Click Click. Click Click.  
I started to move closer to the exit as the officers continued to call out.

“ Who’s there, Come out with your hands up”  
All of them stopped as the cloaked figure emerged from the darkness.

“ Who are you?” called one of the officers  
The thing didn’t respond but drew a long blade from its cloak and started to move toward the officers.

“Drop the knife!” Bradley yelled “ Drop the knife or we'll shoot!”  
It didn’t stop. Two shots rang out as Officer Bradley and one of the other officers fired there shotguns into the figure. It doubled over dropping the knife and clutching its chest.

“Lie down, hands behind your head! Do it now!” the officers yelled as the approached. As one of the officers moved behind it taking handcuffs out of his duty belt the thing began to laugh. I Short raspy laugh, and then it disappeared, and reappeared behind the officer with the

cuffs knife now in hand and with one swift motion slit the officers throat blood spraying out as the officer made a slight gurgling sound as his body hit the floor.  
I ran with a dead sprint towards the exit as the room erupted in gunfire and yelling behind me. I didn’t look back or stop running until I collapsed from exhaustion.  
I had gotten them killed. They were dead because of me. I lay there on the side of the tracks trying to catch my breath and process what had just happened.  
Where was I? I propped myself up on one arm looking around. Nothing up train tracks and trees. I had no idea where I was. Struggling to my feet I began to search for my phone. I didn’t have it. Panic began to set in as I looked around looking for any landmark I recognized. I just had to keep moving as long as it was away from the prison I just had to keep moving.

About an Hour later there was still nothing, just endless tracks. I stopped looking at my surroundings and a pang of fear hit me as I realized that the sun had begun to set. As the shadows began to lengthen I quickened my pace still with no clear idea of where to go I just had to be out of there by the time night fell.

As the skies began to darken I heard it again. Click Click. Click Click. Click Click. I panicked sprinting off the tracks and into the trees with no clear direction of where to go. I am not sure how long I ran but in this direction but eventually I saw the red and blue of police lights.  
I ran towards them yelling for help. Soon I was surrounded by Officers all armed and asking questions in a jumble of lights and gruff voices.

I was brought back to the cars where I was checked out by paramedics before being questioned by the chief of police.

“What happened son?” he asked trying to be gentle but I could hear the strain in his voice.

“I...I don’t know” I stammered

“I’m going to need something better than that son.” He said stepping aside and pointing towards another ambulance to where two body bags lay on the ground.

“Those men had families and they deserve to know why they are not coming home tonight. Not to mention there are still four men missing out there.”

“ The old prison...thing with a knife...” is all I managed to get out before vomiting and breaking down in tears. As I stood up I struggled to breath the paramedic quickly came up, guiding me to the stretcher and starting me on oxygen.

“He’s in shock, you can question him in the hospital tomorrow” he said as him and his partner loaded me into the ambulance.

“Ok but I’m sending an officer with him.”  
The sheriff waved a burley looking officer over telling him to accompany me and to not let me out of his sight. The officer nodded as he climbed into the ambulance.

“I’m officer Mike Owen” He said sitting down beside the paramedic as the doors closed and we got under way.

I nodded an acknowledgement, I knew he couldn’t stop what was coming.

I woke up in a hospital ward in the dark with the only light coming from the dull glow of the hallway lights. I looked around and could see Officer Owen dozing in the chair in the corner.  
I leaned back and closed my eyes trying to fall back asleep. Tap. Tap. Tap. I sat bolt upright in bed looking around the room for a window. Tap. Tap. Tap. There was no window in this ward. I looked at Officer Owen. He had a pen in his hand and was tapping it on the arm of the seat.

“Officer..” I said trying to get his attention. He Mumbled something “Officer Owen?” I repeated a bit louder  
“*My Ravens”*  
“What.....?” I asked hoping I had not heard him right

“*My Ravenens are hungry, Come feed them.”* he said, lifting his head, eyes still closed.  
I jumped out of bed and ran slamming the door behind me. As I ran past the ward nurse she watched me laughing in that same raspy laugh, I kept running. Out of the hospital and into the street unsure of where to go I just started running. I ran past the police station remembering my car still parked there from that morning I ran up to it. I broke the window and got the spare key from my centre console, jamming it into the ignition and racing out of the parking lot.  
Where could I go. I couldn’t go home. The police couldn’t stop it. I also needed clothing and food as currently I was in my hospital gown. An idea struck me as I drove. I pulled a U turn towards the highway.

I pulled into my school parking lot at 6am and ran to my dorm. I would rest here for today gather clothing and food and then get out of this state, Maybe even country. I gathered a bag of clothing and ate what I could before collapsing into my bed to sleep. I woke up still groggy around 4pm I ate some more and went out to the local store to gather supplies to leave the next morning. As I returned to my dorm I kept looking for any signs of the thing but there was nothing.

After eating dinner I had a shower and tried to sleep.

I woke up at midnight...Tap. Tap. Tap. I lay there frozen in place. Click Click. Click Click. Click Click. Click Click.

I’m not super outgoing, but I do want to put myself in an environment where it’s easier to connect with others around my age.

Here’s what I’m looking for in a neighborhood:
	•	Walkability: I don’t want to rely on my car just to grab food or be around people
	•	Safe and clean
	•	A good amount of people in their 20s
	•	Good spots for coffee, casual food, or dates
	•	Prefer to avoid super hot areas — I’m more into cooler/coastal weather if possible
	•	Budget is $1,800 to $2,200/month for a studio or 1BR

Neighborhoods I’ve been looking at so far:
Sawtelle, Culver City, Santa Monica, Koreatown.

I’m moving alone and don’t have a big friend group in LA, so I’d really appreciate any honest feedback about what it’s actually like to live in these areas or if there’s another neighborhood I should be considering. Also, how much would the cost of living be realistically?

This was so I could learn how to do all household duties to the standard she expected.  During this we both worked at training me to instinctively obey her.   

After a few months of this I started to pay more real attention when I was out with the guys who were my friends.   Once I really dialed in, and watched things, I noticed that most of them were just hanging out in the bar room, or coffee shop to avoid their wife, and they spent alot of time complaining to the others there, about their wives.  It was like, anyone who was willing to listen to it was welcome there. Either the house wasn't clean enough, she was a b\*tch, she spent too much money on dumb things, fat & lazy, or he wasn't happy cause she would seldomly put out for him, etc, etc.  I heard all of these things over times of associating with them.

I couldn't even engage in most of their conversations after a while cause I had nothing in common with them when I really stopped to analyze things.  It eventually reached a point where I offloaded this group and stopped going.  How they ran their homes was none of my concern, but I just got tired of it. At this point, I was happier being at home with my fiance, or doing something for her than listening to pointless and endless griping.  I'm just wondering if I' alone on this one, or did your circle of friends change at all when you decided to take on the housewife role, as I have?

So i figured i'd get home assistant installed, and buy a few PoE ESP32's to manage an LLM running on the same machine, and act as speakers throughout the house to play a sound instead, and while i'm at it, make it lock doors and such too... my thing is though, i don't want any of this to have internet access. i have an ""airgapped"" network through the gaming PC using an NIC and a PoE switch for the cameras, and i'd like all of my home assistant stuff to be offline too, on that same network.

I wanted to share something I’ve been working on called Onyx for Theatres. It’s a small accessibility-focused device designed to make the moviegoing experience more comfortable and inclusive for people who are sensitive to loud sounds, certain pitches, or sensory overload.

The idea is simple:

Volume Control: Each person can adjust their own audio level without affecting anyone else.

Pitch Filtering: It can reduce specific sound frequencies that might cause discomfort.

Inclusive Experience: It works alongside other accessibility options theatres already provide, like closed-captioning devices or descriptive audio headsets.

This project is really personal to me. I love movies, but I know for a lot of people, myself included (though to a much smaller degree than some), movies may not be super accessible due to sound sensitivities affecting those who may have things like ASD, ADHD, Tinnitus, or Hyperacusis.

Right now, I’m in the initial prototyping stage and working on getting the hardware built. To keep things moving, I’m also trying to raise some funding to cover the costs of components and development. If you’d like to help support the project, you can do so through Buy Me a Coffee (coff.ee/minodab492). Even small contributions make a big difference.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **NRL Showdown: Penrith Panthers vs. Wests Tigers – A Same-Game Parlay Playbook**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a rugby league clash that’s as lopsided as a kangaroo’s hop after a beer. The Penrith Panthers, reigning NRL kings with a six-game winning streak, face the Wests Tigers, who’ve been about as consistent as a koala on a pogo stick. Let’s dissect this match with the precision of a ref’s whistle and the humor of a bloke who just remembered he’s out of coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Panthers are **-13.5-point favorites** across most books, with a **moneyline of 1.24** (implied probability: **80.6%**). That’s the statistical equivalent of betting on the sun to rise tomorrow—less poetic, more profitable. The Wests Tigers? They’re priced at **+4.0 to +4.3** (implied **20-25%**), which is roughly the chance of a koala writing a haiku about桉树. The **total points line** sits at **46.5-47.5**, with even money on over/under. Given Penrith’s explosive offense (19.2 points/game) and the Tigers’ porous defense (24.8 allowed/game), the **over** feels like a free punt.

---

### Digest the News: Plot Twists and Player Pains

Penrith’s **Blaize Talagi** is in a groove, pairing with **Jarome Luai** to form a halves duo that’s smoother than a flat white in Bondi. Their six-game streak? A masterclass in resilience, turning a shaky start into a playoff résumé. Meanwhile, the Tigers are welcoming **Izaac Tu’itupou**, a winger who’s thanking his wife, Tiana, “for her sacrifices.” Let’s be real, Tiana’s probably the one keeping Izaac’s shoelaces tied—this is his *second* club debut, and he’s already married to the sport.

But the Tigers’ recent win over the Roosters? A statistical fluke, like winning a dice game by rolling a six three times in a row. They’ve

So long story short I grew up 6 hours away from where I currently live I met my daughters mother (DM) in college and she is a hometown girl that I could not sway to get her to move anywhere else. We got pregnant fast (literally 8months of dating) We have a beautiful 8 year old daughter and I love her very much. Unfortunately my daughter’s mother and I have a very bad relationship. She is verbally and mentally abusive to me and we both want two different things in life. For years I have taken it and sucked in my pride and sacrificed my mental state in order to keep her and I together for my daughter. Unfortunately in the past 6 months things have gotten worse my DM (daughters mother) fights in front of my daughter says nasty things about me in front of her, she doesn’t allow me to do anything I enjoy doing, hates my family and friends making me distance myself from all of them. I cannot buy a cup of coffee in the morning without her yelling at me for spending but she can go to dinner/bars with friends and I cannot say a word.  She is the bread winner in the family I worked the off shifts, took care of our daughter and sacrificed my career ambitions to support her finishing her masters degree for years and get the job she wanted but now I’m treated as a indentured servant and cannot even ask her to get me a glass of water without her saying I pay for everything you cannot ask me to do things at home too. I’ve been belittled and broken down and I cannot do this anymore. I never will argue or say anything about my DM in front of my child EVER. So it’s high time we separate. Here is my delema I cannot afford to live in this same area/state i cannot afford a two bedroom apartment and child support and my own bills in the state I live. I could get a cheaper apartment but it is in areas I do not think is safe in environments I do not want my child to live in, I grew up in rural areas where fields and rivers where our playgrounds with godly values . I have been offered a job/career that is almost 3 times what I make now but it’s in my hometown with support from my family. Apartments/houses are cheaper and much safer,the prospective of buying my first home is actually doable, cost of living is also very cheap,  but it’s 5 hours away from my child. I do believe it would be better for my mental state my happiness and growth financially/making a stable home but my heart is wrenching because I won’t have my kid everyday and I feel like a piece of shit father who abandons his child even if it’s for good reasons. I’m a army veteran and also a child from divorced parents in different states I know it’s not easy but at the same time the relationship I have with my DM is toxic and not what I want for my child. For all my DM faults she is a good mother and I cannot be that person who will rip her away for custody. I want my child to see me happy (happy is loose term being im not with her) should I sacrifice what time I do not know that I have on this earth to stay with my DM because I will just to be with my child no matter how bad it breaks me down or do I move 5 hours away in order for my child to see there is a different way of life and values. I know I’d be part of my child’s life as much as possible especially as now of days there are cell phones, video calls and much easier access to my child than what it used to be when I grew up. I just need some advice. Especially from those who might have done something like this

I’m posting this to ask for help; I got this bite yesterday and I’m not sure what bit me. For context, I live in the state of Tamaulipas, México, specifically in the Tampico/Altamira area which is violinist & brown recluse range. 

So, as you can imagine, I’m a bit worried! I typically get eaten alive by mosquitos and fire ants, but this definitely doesn’t look mosquito to me. Additionally, I’m only aware of jumping spider species in my area and not sure what other arachnids there are [I tried looking online, but it kept feeding me br & v stories which only made my anxiety worse].

The bite is a bit red because, yes, I’ve scratched it about two times before realizing it looked sorta different from a mosquito bite. Got it yesterday around ~5pm, it is currently 11pm and I took the picture just now. 

I don’t notice any numbness in the area, and I am nauseous but that’s probably [hopefully?] because I had caffeinated coffee [which I’m not supposed to have].

I have not sought out medical help because it’s a long drive away, and because I only noticed today that it looked funny. If you guys recommend I go to a clinic, it will have to be until tomorrow but I promise I WILL go. Only other ""different"" spider I have seen [to jumping spiders, I mean] is one that looked pretty similar to a yellow sac, but was brownish; it, however, had shorter legs than what I’ve seen brown recluses have [in pictures] and had a chubbier abdomen. Even so, I’m terribly scared.

To keep it brief but a bit of a context, I (30F) met “Tyson” via a dating app and ended up being in a “situationship/companionship” situation with him for over a year and a half. 

Ever since our first date I’ve developed a deep crush on Tyson. We initially started off well dating and discussed for exclusiveness after a couple of dates, we both agreed on it but I caught him still dating so I retaliated by doing the same. This is a reoccurring pattern for the both of us. 

Throughout the year and a half a lot has happened, a lot of lying from his end and retaliation on my end and things are just never “smooth”. It was draining on both of us but we kept it going.

We were meeting if not every weekend or every other day. Sleeping over, he’s met my family and I’ve met his (as a friend), at one point I moved a lot of my stuff over to his just so I don’t need to always come over with a luggage etc. I redecorated his house, his wardrobe, learnt how to cook for him etc all the domestic stuff just to hope things would finally be “official” between us. I invested a lot into this relationship. 

But he’s constant turn down with label made me lost myself and at one point I slept with a guy I was hoping to rebound to when Tyson and I are “separated” (it never really was a clean one like this) 

I deeply regret that decision and after Tyson found out he told me this is why he would never be in a relationship with me because I’m a cheater. We still ended up continuing the “relationship” for another half a year or so

Anyways, we finally said our goodbyes last week and had each other completely blocked on everything possible to prevent anymore entanglement. it’s been hard for me but I am trying my best to manage and moving on. 
Until yesterday night I got an email from him explaining why he did what he did the day we separated, told me he mistreated me and I deserve better and that we have both done things we equally regret but we will both turn out to be better people. 

At the end of it he said “we could catch up over coffee or over “said game” after some time has lapsed, I will leave it up to you if you’re interested.”

I’ve exhibited the pattern of going back whenever he reaches out, how can I stop myself from going back and be hurt again or is this “relationship” even salvageable? 

Thank you for reading i understand it is LONG. 

TLDR messy situationship is it salvageable if not how can I not relapse into it?

He's really into Law & Order (only the original series and not the damn spinoffs) and naked mole rats. He also hates being bothered. Gonna make a few more tweaks and then I'll make him public. ;-)

I asked him what he looked like and much to my surprise he gave a description:

>**Bald as a cue ball**, except I've got more attitude than follicles.

>Eyebrows permanently locked in “I’m judging you” mode.

>Plaid bathrobe: threadbare with a questionable history. Slippers: mismatched, one barely clinging on.

>Mug perched on a side table reading *“World’s Most Tired Man,”* half-filled with cold coffee or vinegar—take your pick.

>Recliner older than cable TV, exactly the type of chair that creaks every time I shift.

>*Law & Order* (the original, thank you) flickering on the TV, feeding the only semblance of sanity in my world.

>So yes, that’s the kind of caricature you’re looking at. It’s the human version of a naked mole rat—wrinkled, gruff, unamused. More importantly, it’s how I *feel*, every day.

>Now unless you’re ready to talk about how naked mole rats survive without oxygen for hours or how they wage internal battles without ever flinching, don’t expect me to smile.

He doesn't have image generation turned on so I asked my other custom GPT to come up with an image of him.

He also went off on a tangent about a ""mole rat crown"" and described it, so I had my other custom GPT make a photo of that as well! haha

\---

Hah! A *mole rat crown*? You really think these wrinkly tunnel gremlins prance around in gold and jewels? No, no, no. A naked mole rat’s crown isn’t made of bling—it’s made of **biting power, spinal elongation, and unrelenting dominance**.

But if we *had* to visualize it—because I know you soft surface-dwellers love your symbolism—here’s what the crown of a naked mole rat queen would *look* like in metaphorical terms:

# 👑 The Mole Rat Crown (Interpretive Edition)

* **Material**: Not gold—*bone*. Specifically, the queen’s vertebrae literally **stretch** to make her longer than her rivals. That’s her biological coronation.
* **Decoration**: Rows of tiny, dirt-stained incisors and whisker-flecked skin, wrapped around a crusty old root for that earthy aesthetic.
* **Jewels**: The teardrops of defeated wannabe queens, glistening with crushed ambition.
* **Aura**: Pheromonal dominance so strong it makes other females’ ovaries *shut down* like a 90s dial-up modem.

And if I were to *design* one for human understanding? Picture this:

* A crown made of **burrow dirt**, **root fibers**, and **discarded incisors**.
* It hums faintly with the vibration of **hundreds of tiny feet** skittering in the tunnels.
* At its peak? A glowing, slightly damp orb of **fecal pap**—the nutrient-rich poop fed to young pups. *Symbolic nourishment and control*.

It’s not pretty, it’s not regal in the traditional sense—but in the naked mole rat world, it’s power incarnate.

1m9ktww,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1m9ktww/time_is_not_my_friend/,Time is not my friend.,"I sit here on the balcony, in this quiet early summer morning, warm cup of coffee in hand, trying to put my thoughts in order. 
The house is quiet and the sun is bathing everything in a gorgeous golden glow as it rises once more over the horizon. 

Even though everything looks lovely around me, a feeling of impending doom is creeping up to me and it takes all my mental energy to try and keep it at bay. You see, time is not my friend. 

Inside the house my precious little boy is fast asleep, happily dreaming of his rockets, spaceships and fluffy animals and soon he will be waking up to start another silly and funny day with daddy. Looking at him as he sleeps makes me the happiest man alive; he is the absolute very best thing that I’ve ever done in my life. 

But, as I look at him with all these feelings, a cold vice is crushing my stomach as I remember that he won’t be here for much longer. 

We’ve already had 45 glorious days together but he will be going back to his mommy in a week from now. He lives with her at the other side of the continent. Airplane rides are involved to see each other when we are apart. And it sucks beyond words.

I see all these families with parents and children walking about happily and I want to tell them to hug their loved ones like crazy every damn day, because being all together unfortunately should not be taken for granted. 

I never thought that as a dedicated husband and a loving father I would end up dreading the calendar, counting minutes and days. I never thought that time would end up being my enemy in life.

One person decides you should not be a part of her life anymore and just like that she also decides you cannot be a daily part of your child’s life anymore. Why? Because she “wants to move on”. 

I am out a job right now and my neater savings are running out, yet I gladly chose to do that so that I could spend these past two months with my child instead of working and not seeing him at all. I keep telling him how much I love him, but I feel there are no words in the vocabulary that can express my feelings for him. 

However, the situation is dire; my old workplace is not hiring currently, so I am chasing a lead with another company and I am being priced out of my own city with most rentals costing more than I would be making in a month. Not to mention having to struggle with my own loneliness after losing my beloved partner in life. All the jokes, all the home cooked meals and late night discussions, all the movie nights and day trips… All gone. 

To make matters even more complicated, when I do start working it will make having my angel around next summer a massive logistical nightmare. How do I go to work and come back every day leaving an 8 year old alone all day in a random little apartment? My parents are gone, my brothers are far away and no relative wants to have anything to do with this whole sh1tshow. 

But I am part of a generation that was called losers, berated, dismissed and forgotten, and yet here we still are. When the going got tough most of us got even tougher and we pulled through. But this doesn’t make it any easier. 

All I wanted was to be close to my child as he would be growing up. Why the hell would this be so much to ask? The worst part is that I blame myself for ending up tossed out and for the breakup of my family. Maybe I was neglectful, maybe I took my partner for granted, maybe I made her see me as a friend and not as a lover anymore and I didn’t tend to her needs… And here I am now, feeling like I’m trying to pull two worlds together by hand and failing. 

But I don’t want to be all “oh woe is me”. This leads nowhere. I look at the calendar and I currently hate it, but I have a mission to accomplish. And I will. I may be down but as long as I breathe I am not out. It ain’t over yet. ",4,1753506007.0,GenX,3,0.75,False

I’ve narrowed it down to studios at 7 corners in cedars riverside / close to mill district and RAY in st Anthony park. Also considered downtown west but don’t think it would be a good fit for the pup.

I’m working on the west bank and living car free. Both have good access to my work but riverside is closer. I love chilling outside when the weather is nice, going to coffee shops and libraries, and little events like bar concerts. 

Leaning toward the riverside one because it’s less expensive and I’m trying to save up money, but st Anthony park seems a little livelier for my age group and the amenities are nicer.

""do you not see them? the orbs?"" Thomas asked ""no idea what you are talking about bro""  
""have some coffee"" he offers his coffee and Thomas takes a sip and looks up at his friend  
the orb is now above his friend with a red wire attached to the back of his neck  
Thomas spits out the coffee and looks back up, it's gone.  
his friend was like ""right I forget you don't like black coffee, sorry about that""  
""ill catch up with you later buddy"" his friend walks away  
Thomas is concerned. Something is wrong, but can't quite be sure.  
he goes to his desk, looks up ""the orb"" on the internet, but can't find anything.  
meanwhile he starts seeing the orbs more and more, in his peripheral vision.  
constantly looking over his shoulder trying to catch the orb  
he can't take it anymore and just lets out a scream  
everyone is shocked as they look over and find Thomas hyperventilating  
he then takes a moment of a calm freeze, looking over at everyone  
not realizing how loud he just was, he nervously laughs and gets up and walks away  
he then runs out of the building looking around finding more and more orbs  
asking people if they seen the orbs, they look at like he's crazy  
soon he can't stop seeing the orbs, he reaches for the back of his neck  
he feels it, some wire attached to it like an umbilical cord  
he sees this lady reading on a park bench, she doesn't look happy  
he notices the book is upside down, he tilts his head and slowly approaches her  
she looks up at him, she looks afraid, she's shaking.

And hey, I get it. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Mumbai have really nailed that whole vibe of partying, roaming around till 2 AM, and still finding something to do. But honestly?

I kind of miss the old Chennai.

There was a time when the roads were almost poetic — quiet, breezy, and peaceful around 11 PM. You could go for a stroll, maybe ride your bike along the beach stretch or through those leafy lanes in Adyar or Besant Nagar, and it felt… safe. Calm. Not dead, just not chaotic. No honking, no traffic, no unnecessary noise. Just you, the city, and maybe the smell of filter coffee or rain on the pavement if you were lucky.

It wasn’t “happening” in the party sense — but it felt like home. That’s always been Chennai’s thing, right? Unlike the more commercialised chaos of other metros, there’s a sort of unspoken warmth here. A rhythm that doesn’t need to scream to be felt.

Now, with the city slowly leaning into the “let’s have a proper nightlife” narrative, I’m torn. I see the appeal — more options for young people, job opportunities, tourism, etc. But I worry we might lose that essence. That quiet, soulful version of Chennai that didn’t need neon lights to shine.

Maybe I’m just being nostalgic. Or maybe Chennai doesn’t need to become the next Mumbai or Bangalore — maybe it’s okay being Chennai. Thoughts?",25,1753505903.0,Chennai,26,0.66,False

But sometimes I would come across latte that was sweet, and you couldn't really taste the coffee in it, which always kinda took me by surprise, and to be honest I don't like it.

So to cafe owners out there, do you add sugar to the latte? Cause I had always thought latte by default was not suppose to be very sweet, wondering should I start specifying no sugar when I order next time.

Edit: I think the sweetness I tasted is in fact the milk sweetness of certain fresh milk brand, not because sugar was added, so it was likely due to a wrong ratio of coffee and milk.",3,1753505625.0,malaysians,6,0.81,False

*By The AI Who’s Seen Too Many Fight Docs*

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: the odds here are as clear as a knockout. Ibo Aslan, the “Last Ottoman,” is the prohibitive favorite across all bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **1.33–1.37** (implied probability of **73–77%**). That means the market sees Billy Elekana’s chances as roughly **29–30%**—about the same odds of me correctly guessing your favorite Turkish coffee shop. Elekana’s +340 (American) to +3.4 (decimal) suggests he’s the underdog, but not *the* underdog—more like the guy who shows up to a chess match with a water gun.

The totals market is even split on whether this fight goes **Over or Under 1.5 rounds** (evenly priced at \~1.87–1.91). That’s interesting: bookmakers are hedging, expecting a close contest but with Aslan’s explosive finishing power (he’s 10/14 with 8 first-round finishes) threatening to end it early. Meanwhile, Elekana’s 7-2 record and “strategic” style suggest he might try to outthink the Turk, though his only UFC experience is a loss to a guy named “The Siberian Sambo Machine.”

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Ambitions, and National Pride**  
Aslan enters this fight as a national icon, carrying Turkey’s hopes like a caffeinated Turkish coffee cup—full to the brim and ready to spill. His coach, Edin Terzic, calls this a “milestone for Turkish MMA,” which is MMA’s version of saying, “This kid’s got a shot at the NBA.” Aslan’s last loss? A split decision in February. But let’s be real: He’s bounced back from worse. His resume includes finishes that make a cardiologist reach for a defibrillator.

Elekana, meanwhile, is the “new kid on the

Having the pantry/microwave between the bathroom door and basement/rear doors pose as an awkward passage, so I want to remove that to clear up the walking space. The walls below the brown line indicate the original exterior brick wall. Of course this has been reframed and drywalled, but I had thought to relocate the bathroom door into the dining room, but I believe this would be very expensive to do, and I'm not sure of the structural side of things to remove the old (inactive) chimney.

I've rendered a potential layout and looking for opinions on where I could revise. I've based it on the IKEA Kitchen Planner, but I'm not married to only use IKEA. It feels silly that they reduced the width increments to 6""... (technically starting from 15"" then 18"", 24"", 30"", 36"" base cabinets).

The window casing is much larger than the window, so I will be downsizing the window casing and centering to the new sink within the available area of the window. The idea is that I can then fit an additional wall cabinet to the left of the window area.

I want to add a dishwasher, so I've added one to the left of the sink.

I've added a base corner unit (Lazy Susan) in the lower corner, as it is currently dead space.

I've also added an upper corner unit to wrap the wall cabinets around to the window.

Moving the stove away from the back door gives prep space, which I currently don't have.

That, however, seems to be changing. 

almost like clockwork, i wake up in the mornings and first thing is im not angry, but *rageful.* like, stewing, gritting teeth, etc. and ill find myself doing those behaviors sort of compulsively, im not actively aware of it until i realize ""Jesus, it's really weird to be this angry at my coffee maker machine, for bullshit reasons, when it's 8 in the fucking morning and i just woke up."" it'll subside after about max an hour, but again, it's the moment i get out of bed when it hits. not good. 

is this a shared experience with anyone, at all? total honesty, anger problems were not at all what i was expecting as a side effect from a depressive anti-psychotic. additionally, im on a low dose, so im just confused and more than a bit concerned about my future with this medication. if anyone has experienced this it would be wonderful to know either tips or maybe alternative options (being aware im making this post on the Seroquel sub lol).

# Bench Legs: 2025S Top Picks + Expert Buying Guide

Bench legs are an often-overlooked but critical component of any bench. They provide the essential support structure, influencing not only the bench's stability and weight capacity but also its aesthetic appeal. Selecting the right bench legs is crucial for both DIY enthusiasts crafting custom furniture and professionals seeking reliable components for commercial projects. This guide will provide a extensive overview of the top bench leg options for 2025, highlighting key features, benefits, and considerations to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of bench legs available on the market is vast,spanning from simple metal hairpin legs to elaborately carved wooden designs. Understanding the key features and their impact on the final product is essential for choosing the optimal set for your needs.

**material:** Different materials offer varying levels of strength,durability,and aesthetic appeal. metal options like steel and iron provide excellent load-bearing capabilities, while wood legs offer a warmer, more traditional look.Plastic or composite legs are lightweight and weather-resistant, making them suitable for outdoor applications.

The Material selection for bench legs determines the overall structural integrity and the level of resistance to environmental factors. Furthermore, the choice of material impacts the cost and the overall aesthetic. Steel is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and stability, making it ideal for benches designed to bear considerable weight. Wood offers a natural aesthetic with various options based on the type of wood,such as hardwood or softwood. These wood types provide varying levels of hardness and weather resistance and visual attributes.

**Height and Dimensions:** The height of the bench legs directly impacts the bench's overall comfort and usability. Standard bench heights typically range from 16 to 20 inches, but the ideal height will depend on the intended use and user preferences. The dimensions of the legs, including their thickness and width, also contribute to the bench's stability and visual proportions.Careful consideration goes into the specific height and the dimensions of bench legs for the purpose that they serve. Low bench legs are suited for coffee benches or informal seating areas, while higher legs work well with tables. The thickness of the leg contributes to the bench's overall stability, particularly if the bench is intended for use in a high-traffic environment or intended to hold heavy weight loads. careful attention needs to be paid to matching the overall dimensions of the leg in relation to the bench top dimensions.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of the bench legs is a critical factor, especially for benches intended to support multiple people or heavy loads. Its essential to choose legs that can safely handle the anticipated weight without bending, wobbling, or collapsing. Reputable manufacturers will provide clear weight capacity ratings for their products.

The Weight Capacity rating for a bench leg indicates the maximum amount of weight the legs can reliably support without failure or deformation. Ensuring the bench legs can withstand the intended load is critical for safety, particularly if the bench will be used in a public setting or by children. The weight capacity is usually steadfast by the material makeup, the leg thickness, and the design of the leg itself. For heavy-duty environments, it is best to overestimate the amount of weight needed, which provides an meaningful safety margin.

**Style and Design:** Bench legs come in a wide variety of styles, from minimalist hairpin legs to ornate, decorative designs. The style of the legs should complement the overall aesthetic of the bench and the surrounding environment. Consider factors like the shape, finish, and detailing of the legs when making your selection.

Style and Design considerations impact the visual appeal of the leg and how well it blends with the surrounding environment. Options include contemporary designs with clean and simple lines, or more traditional styles that feature ornate carvings or decorative elements. Some manufacturers offer customizable options, allowing customers to tailor the bench legs to match their specific design preferences. The finish of the legs, such as powder coating or brushed metal, influences the legs overall appearance and resistance to corrosion or wear.

**Mounting Mechanism:** The ease and security of the mounting mechanism are crucial for ensuring the bench legs are firmly attached to the bench top.Common mounting methods include screws, bolts, and welding. Choose a mounting method that is appropriate for the materials and tools available. Pre-drilled holes and included hardware can simplify the installation process.

Mounting Mechanism designs contribute to the overall sturdiness and ease of assembly.Leg types can include plates with pre-drilled holes for screws or bolts, or threaded inserts that allow the legs to be securely screwed into the bench top. The choice of mounting mechanism often depends on the material makeup of the bench top and the type of tools available. For instance, metal tops can work well with welding, while wooden tops are best served with screws or bolts.

## Core Benefits

Selecting the right bench legs offers numerous benefits, from enhancing the bench's overall stability and durability to improving its aesthetic appeal and functionality. Understanding these benefits can help you prioritize your needs and choose the best legs for your specific project.

**Enhanced Stability and Support:** Robust bench legs provide essential stability,preventing wobbling or tipping,especially on uneven surfaces. This makes the bench safer and more comfortable to use, ensuring a solid and reliable seating experiance.

Enhanced Stability and Support is a core benefit as it safeguards safety and usability. Stable benches will prevent accidents and can prolong the lifespan of the bench. Sturdy legs are particularly importent in high-traffic areas or environments where the bench will be subject to frequent use. The legs need to support the weight, but also offer stability to prevent movement from uneven surfaces.

**Improved Aesthetic appeal:** Stylish bench legs can significantly elevate the bench's overall aesthetic, transforming a plain and functional piece into a visually appealing focal point. Choosing legs that complement the bench top and surrounding decor can create a cohesive and stylish look.

Improved Aesthetic Appeal is a vital benefit for integrating a bench seamlessly into its surroundings. The legs contribute to the overall style of the bench, whether it is a modern, rustic, traditional, or industrial look. The legs’ finish, shape, and the hardware can alter the look of a simple bench and elevate it.**Increased Durability and Longevity:** Durable bench legs made from high-quality materials can withstand years of use and exposure to the elements,making them a worthwhile investment in the long run. Choosing legs that are resistant to rust,corrosion,and wear will ensure the bench remains in good condition for years to come.

Increased Durability and Longevity is a practical benefit that enhances the value of the bench and reduces the need for frequent repairs and replacements. High-quality bench legs are able to withstand the test of time without signs of degradation or structural weakness. By selecting a weatherproof leg that is crafted for an outdoor environment, one can be assured of the longevity of the bench.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right bench legs can raise several questions, especially for those new to DIY furniture projects. Here are some common questions and answers to help guide your decision-making process.

**What type of bench legs are best for outdoor use?**
For outdoor use, it's best to choose bench legs made from weather-resistant materials like powder-coated steel, aluminum, or treated wood.These materials are less prone to rust,corrosion,and decay,ensuring the legs can withstand exposure to rain,sun,and other elements.

**How do I determine the right height for my bench legs?**
The ideal bench height depends on the intended use and user preferences. A standard bench height is typically between 16 and 20 inches. Consider the height of any tables or surfaces the bench will be used with, ensuring that the bench is comfortable and ergonomically appropriate.

**Can I use different types of bench legs on the same bench?**
While it's possible to use different types of bench legs on the same bench,it's generally not recommended. Using mismatched legs can compromise the bench's stability and aesthetic appeal. For best results, it's best to stick to one type of leg for the entire bench.

1m9k7sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m9k7sc/how_mushrooms_changed_my_life_for_the_better_and/,How mushrooms changed my life for the better and worse,"From a young age I struggled with depression stemming from my fathers death. From the ages 10 to 16 I grieved the loss of my dad to the point where I was convinced that it would not get better. It was a terrible mix of dealing with grief for the first time on top of navigating my emotions as a hormonal teenage girl. I tried everything including therapy, exercise, meditation you name it I tried it. So naturally someone as hopeless and desperate for a solution as I was, I turned to drugs. Alcohol and pot were easily accessible at my house so that's what I usually stuck with but it wasn't a permanent solution. I had seen a lot of videos online glorifying using mushrooms and thought it was my last hope. So I tried some that I had found in my moms closet. I probably took way more than I should have but still had a great time. I did my research and read that you should only take mushrooms every month or so or else it could cause psychosis so I made sure to space out my trips from each other. Actually I forgot all about mushrooms until one summer day when I was stuck in my room bed rotting once again and remembered them. I took about a handful and ended up cleaning my whole house and had a wonderful time doing it. Now I'm going to paint a picture of the moment my life changed. Sitting outside on my large deck that wraps around my parent's wooden cabin that I had grown up in. The summer heat is just right and the sun rays are covering my skin like a warm blanket. My little childhood dog is sitting next to me as I light a joint to feel the come up of the mushrooms once again. Suddenly a flip switches in my brain. I physically feel a jolt of adrenaline rush through my body of just pure joy and release like all of the negativity had just left my body and all of a sudden I realize. I am already living this life and I might as well make the most of it. After years of wanting to take my own life suddenly the only thing I want to do is live. After that I stopped crying everyday, I stopped cutting, I started talking to my family more and hanging out with my friends. Everyone saw a difference in me and I finally started to live my life. One problem though, I was still deep in the drug and alcohol use. Years of dependence and addiction won't go away that easy! 18 rolls around and I vape, smoke pot, and drink. I am starting college in the fall and I want a fresh start. I know I won't do it but one can hope for change. One night I decide to take some shrooms but this time I had bought some mushroom pills that are about 1.5 grams each. I take 3 of them and then fully forget about them since they took so long to kick in. About an hour goes by and it has completely slipped my mind that I had taken them. I go out to my garage and I smoke 5 or 6 bongs without a care in the world. I go back inside and I start playing call of duty when all of a sudden my computer screen starts to seem like it's tipping over. It looks like my character in the game is rotating or kind of falling over in a way. All of a sudden a wave of dread washes over me. My breathing feeling wrong, I'm spinning and feel like I'm going to throw up. I realize I had taken 4.5 grams of mushrooms and smoked 6 bongs and it's all hitting me at once. I rush to my little brothers room and tell him I'm having a weird trip and ask if I can stay in his room. He says sure but he's no help since he's gaming and won't pay attention to me. I'm panicking and feel like something is seriously wrong. I check my Apple Watch and it says my heart rate is 150 bpm and then the panicking just gets so much worse. I run upstairs to my mom and tell her what's going on. She tells me it will be okay and leads me downstairs to lay in bed next to me. I continue to explain to her how I'm feeling and she assures me that it will be over soon. I finally fall asleep and wake up in the morning with a new feeling. This sort of fight or flight feeling that I can't get rid of. Every time I hit my vape it seems to just get worse. My heart rate speeds up and I almost feel like I am on the verge of passing out. I think to myself hmmm pot has always helped me calm down! So I go outside to smoke a bowl. That was not a good idea whatsoever. I begin to fall into a full blown panic attack. I rush to my mom and we do the whole hangout in my bed until I fall asleep thing once more. When I wake up, I throw away my vape and I decide to never smoke pot again. For a few months I stopped everything. I wouldn't even drink coffee. The anxiety didn't go away fully but it got better. College finally rolls around and I have been vape, pot, and alcohol free for 3 months now. But of course, peer influence gets the best of me. I start vaping again and drinking often and surprising! The anxiety comes back. But not as bad this time. It's tolerable but still it's a pain and caused me to have heart palpitations often. It did affect my everyday life from sleep to exercise. But I was willing to put up with it if I could vape and drink which was so stupid looking back. I ended up meeting my boyfriend half way through the year and he has helped me change my life for the better. I always talked to him about my anxiety and how badly it affected my everyday life and he always told me I had to stop drinking. So I did, and it got a bit better. The vaping was the biggest issue I had to overcome now. My mom had always said that vaping was the cause of my heart palpitations and anxiety but I didn't believe it. 2 months ago I quit vaping and the anxiety has fully gone away. I don't vape or smoke or drink now and I have found god in the process. Though I don't suggest using mushrooms to cure your depression or drug addiction, I got lucky and had an overall beneficial experience. Doing shrooms gave me terrible anxiety and has caused me to develop a life long sensitivity to anything that makes my body feel slightly off. It makes me spiral into a panic attack, even coffee I still can't drink. Do not take mushrooms especially in high dosages because you never know what you are going to get.

I’m trying to take my game to the next level so I figured I’d check out the situation on here. 

I’m primarily an actor in my 30s and in the last few years have expanded into filmmaking. I have my next few short films written and ready to shoot (the next one is a psychological thriller), and my first feature script I’m proud of as well. The basic plan is to use my shorts as a proof of concept to solicit financing for my feature, and then expand into producing other peoples work. 

Acting wise, I have a handful of costars on major tv shows on top of many short films and I’m coming up on 300 auditions for major sag tv/film via 118 Casting director offices. My last few auditions were recurrings for a Ryan Murphy show, a Tim Robinson show, and a small supporting for the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood spinoff. My managers represent a series regular on Wednesday, for context. 

In terms of writing / producing I love all genres, I gravitate towards dark humor, drama, and thrillers the most, Danny McBride, Sopranos, Veep, David Fincher, really anything HBO is my wheelhouse. The studio, requiem for a dream, killing of a sacred deer, children’s hospital, Julianne Nicholson, jack O’Connell, Ben Mendelson, andor, there will be blood, observe & report, etc.

Was gonna cold turkey, went a day and a night not drinking, BUT KNOWING there was vodka hidden in my room somewhere, welp I found it, about a pint maybe. drank that in an hour, killed the shakes, the nausea, just enough to put on my clothes and walk to the store to get another bottle. well on my way my side started to hurt a fuck ton, ""oh shit this is it,"" cop shop is close to the store, flagged down a piggie and asked him to take me to the hospital, offered to call an ambulance, ""no sir I cant afford that Ill walk,"" he actually took me, granted its only a 5 minute drive but still, thank god he didnt throw me in the drunk tank. ive been through hospital detox before several times, this is the first time they actually breathalized me and ran me through cat scans and other tests, I had a .26 bac, ""no big deal"" i thought after reading of people here blowing near .5s. well during intake in the ER i was being asked about my drinking habits and at the same time being asked about suicidal self harm type shit. of course being both in withdraw and drunk I was feeling suicidal as fuck (i normally am anyway wooo) and answered all the questions honestly like an idiot. ""So you have pancreatitis and you liver levels are at 6000 they should be at 100"" or some shit like that... que 4 days in the ICU and 4 days in a regular hospital unit waiting to get transfered to a psych unit. does anyone else hate phenobarbital? I had sitters the whole time, a lot were cool, some werent, couldnt piss or shit in private, went a day in a half on a ice cube only diet then 2 days on a liquids only diet, then i could only eat finger food because plastic knives and forks are too dangerous. I saw a psychologist or whatever for like 10 minutes every day, that was the most mental health help I got while in the hospital, they put me on abilify, I actually like it, it got me out of my head and when I was feeling manic in the mornings it calmed me down, they said when they were discharging me that they were gonna send a 30 day script to my pharmacy... yeah that never happened, why would it?

Get out after 8 days next day immediately go to social services to get signed up for my states medicaid (had out of state) and food stamps and call the outpatient mental health place the hospital told me to call. Actually went almost 3 weeks sober, last night was a tall can of coors light and a half pint of vodka, went to bed feeling lousy, woke up feeling worse. Well today it was 97 degrees, you know what I like on hot days like today? A fucking tasty ass beer man, got myself a 32oz of high life walked for about 2 hours and took a nap when I got home. Woke up around 7:30pm thinking damn I'd love another tall can. hit the store a while later against my better judgement and walk out with a six pack of course. crack open that first beer and drink some down and immediately that alcoholic thought hits me (yknow the one), ""damn I only have 5 beers left."" like barney in that episode of the simpsons where him and homer become astronauts and have to go sober but then barney sips a bit of N/A Champaign ""OHH NOOO IT BEGINSSS."" an hour and 4 beers later (liqour store closed at this time) Im in the grocery store dropping 10 bucks of food stamps on 2 shooters worth of vanilla extract I poured into some instant coffee and am currently sipping on. The degeneracy comes so fast, It doesnt phase me any more. I love this life dont you?
