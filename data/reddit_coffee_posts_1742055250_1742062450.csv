In the Lumon claymation video earlier in s2, it says Lumon has presence in 206 countries, but a lot of fans point out that in the real world, there are only 195 countries. Now, I know that they’re lying to innies, and that a lot of info they tell them about the world outside their work is made up, but I also know that everything in this show is intentional. It got me thinking about the human skeleton, which has 206 bones. To me, it speaks more to Lumon trying to control people. There’s soooo many theories and analyses that are floating around, so I apologize if this bones theory has come up and been debunked already. It was just an idea I had before getting my coffee in this morning. ",1,1742062314.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False
1jc19qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jc19qt/i_thought_i_saw_my_ex_in_the_window_but_it_wasnt/,I thought I saw my ex in the window. But it wasn't her,"I realised there was a ghost in my window after my ex moved out.  

I was slumped in my couch, alone, and then – you know how you feel when someone staring is at you, and look over and someone actually is? That happened. I could feel eyes on me, I looked around, and there she was, her reflection in our fifth-floor apartment window.  

I stood up, I might have cried out from fear- I don’t remember   

I went over to the window, which looked over a narrow alley and snowy roofs. Our apartment building was in a street mostly with townhouses.  

Anyway, the face in the window didn’t budge, or blink. Just stared. I stared back.  

I couldn’t tell if the face was outside the window, or in the window, if that makes sense. On impulse, pushing the limp curtains fully aside, I opened the window. Wind howled in from the street-lit darkness. I quickly pulled the window close again.  

Her face glimmered back into the glass, backlit from the streetlight.  

And then I noticed- I’m not a noticing sort, but I noticed her hair. It was all done up fancy, and there were lights- no, sparkles, like jewels in her hair, a trail of elaborate sparkles running from the tops of her ears towards the back.  

And then, as I stared and she stared back, tears running down her pale cheeks, it clicked.  

She was a bride. She was done up similar to girls at their weddings- we had been to a wedding a few months back, and I remember the hair and the sparkling jewels curving around the bride's forehead. Pretty.  

The girl opened her mouth and I remembered my living room was haunted. I reached my hand to the window. She also raised her hand, and through the ice touch of the glass I felt her fingers, warm and reassuring.  

The warmth of her fingers was the first thing that ignited actual fear in me. It blazed in me as my eyes stretched wide-open, and the blaze burned my fog of heartbreak and confusion and made me see clearly: The girl in the window wasn’t my ex- a silly fancy in my mind- in fact looked nothing like her- but a supernatural sad bridal creature, haunting me.   

I snatched my hand away and leapt back. The woman’s face shone brightly in the glass, and she smiled. Her painted lips moved.   

“Let me in Charles, I’m so cold.”  

I blinked. How could I – what did she mean? On impulse, I pulled the curtains, which had been hanging back, close together, and collapsed back on the couch.   

I realised I was sweating. And very soon after, a great wave of fatigue pulled me under, and I fell into the deepest slumber I have ever known.   

I forgot to think about my ex much the next day. Occasionally the bride’s face in the window swam into my mind. I didn’t feel much fear anymore, and towards the end of the day, I found myself wondering if she would still be there.    

She was.   

We stared at each other. Our fingers touched through the glass. “Let me in-” her words glided into my brain. “I can help you. I know how you feel.”   

My brain jerked. I snatched my fingers away, and let the curtains fall. How could she know how I felt? The huge fatigue welled up in me again, and the image of the face the last thing I saw before everything went black.  

The next day was Saturday. For the first time since the break up, I was happy it was a Saturday, and the day didn’t loom pointlessly in front of me. I went straight to the local library, which I hadn’t visit since childhood, and dove into the local archives.   

In an hour or so I had found what I needed to know. My building was built on the site of a large old house. About fifty years ago, a young bride had jumped out of a balcony to her death after the groom-to-be jilted her the morning of their wedding, a sensational local news story. I stared at the young sad face of the bride in the digitized old newspaper, the same face that looked at me from my window every night, asking to be let back in.  

But even if I wanted to, how could I? That evening, I flung the window open, hoping to be rid of her longing stare into my soul. And there was nothing, just the street night glare and icy rush of window. The moment I pulled the window shut, she shone into the glass. “Let me in Charles. I can help you, I know how you feel.”  

They say you get used to everything, and soon I got used to that sad sparkly face in the window, yearning to come in, claiming to help me. And even though I couldn’t bring her back in, I think maybe she was helping me. Because I seemed to be thinking about my ex and the break up less and less. I resumed my usual gym routine, and a few weeks after that visit to the library, I gave in to the insistence of my friends to set up a new dating profile. Very soon after that, I found myself going out on coffee dates, which then progressed to dinner dates, and from there to do-you-want-to-come-back-to-my-place dates with lovely Helen.   

As we settled on the couch, I turned and pulled Helen close to me, savouring this new romantic bliss.   

A shine caught my eyes and my eyelids fluttered opened. I glimpsed the face in the window over Helen’s shoulder, the sparkle and shine of her eyes and teeth and the jewels in her hair and the street lights dazzled me. I jerked away from Helen, and cried out. How could I have forgotten about her?   

Helen smiled politely at me. “What’s wrong Charles?”  

“The curtains-” I muttered and stood up and walked over to pull them close.   

The face came up so close I could feel the warmth of her skin. “Now Charles!” she begged. “Let me in now!”  

Without thinking, I pulled the window open. Icy air whooshed in.   

“Just want a breath of fresh air.” I heard myself explaining to Helen, who seemed quite motionless on the couch.   

I went back to the couch, and settled next to her. “Helen?” I placed my arms around her, pulling her towards me.   

And then I saw the sparkles in her hair, the jewels tucked in an elaborate and familiar pattern around her ears and curling back.   

I cried out in horror, reeling back. The face from the window was superimposed on Helen’s lively pretty features. “Oh Charles, it’s so warm here. Never let me back out.”  

“Helen!” I cried, horrified at what I had done. I grabbed her shoulders and started shaking her. “Helen, listen to me!” I shook her again, and she smiled at me, lying back on the couch, her face another’s.   

I took her by the hand, yanked her to her feet, dragged her to the window, and flung it open. “Out! Out!” I cried, and we tussled in the rush of cold black air. Her hands were strong on mine, pulling me through the window. All the lights and sparkles seemed to turn upside down, and suddenly I was dangling outside, with nothing beneath me. My hands gripped the railing, and I could feel a force greater than gravity pulling me down.   

“Charles!” screamed Helen. I looked up at her, and she bent towards me, her face her own. “Hold on” she gasped, and she pulled at me. I was able to climb up and crawl in, gripping her arms. I heard her cries of pain but she remained steady. Once in, I immediately slammed the window shut, and we collapsed, entwined and panting on the floor.    

After a while we got up. Helen said casually she’s going to put the kettle on for a cuppa. It sounded like a good idea, and I said I wanted one too. As I followed her into the kitchen, I looked back at the living room window, which was black, reflecting the normal glare of street lights. Helen was kind and gentle to me.    

I never saw the face in the window again.

1jc15fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/1jc15fc/the_day_i_stopped_stalking_ctos_on_linkedin_and/,The day I stopped stalking CTOs on LinkedIn (and started booking demos),"Remember that feeling when you hit ""send"" on a cold email you spent an hour crafting... only to be met with deafening silence?

Three months ago, I was sitting in my apartment, surrounded by empty coffee cups, staring at a spreadsheet of potential leads for my HRMS software. I had exactly zero demos booked that week, despite spending 20+ hours researching prospects.

I remember thinking, ""I didn't become a developer to spend my life doing *this*.""

That night, I made a decision that changed everything: What if I could engineer my way out of this problem?

# The experiment

I'm a technical founder, not a sales person. So I approached outreach like I would approach a coding problem:

1. I identified the pattern: Most ""personalized"" cold emails aren't actually personal - they're just mail-merged flattery
2. I built a system to truly understand prospect contexts: their tech stack, recent challenges, team structure
3. I created an AI model that could learn how *I* write when I'm genuinely interested in someone's work

The first message I sent using this system got a response in 7 minutes. Not an auto-reply—an actual conversation.

# The results

Within a month, I booked 7 demos without writing a single outreach message from scratch. The prospects didn't just reply—they were *prepared* for the calls. One CTO even said, ""This is the first cold email I've responded to in years.""

The difference wasn't ""growth hacking"" or ""sales techniques"" - it was simply making each interaction genuinely relevant to that specific person.

# Why I'm sharing this:

I've built this system into a tool called [SalesNode](https://salesnode.tech/) \- specifically for technical founders who'd rather be building products than crafting ""the perfect cold email.""

But here's where I need your input. Before I go deeper into development, I want to know:

1. Is this a ""shut up and take my money"" solution or just another ""AI toy"" in your eyes?
2. What's the most soul-crushing part of your sales process right now?
3. If you could automate one aspect of customer outreach, what would it be?

I'm not here to pitch—I'm here to build something that actually solves a problem for people like us. If this resonates with you, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

And if it doesn't? Well, my IDE is always waiting for me.",2,1742061917.0,EntrepreneurRideAlong,0,1.0,False

Why the fuck is it so impossible to meet new pals??? Surely its not just me that this is happening to? 

We are repeatedly told what to do. Reach out. Show interest. Make the first move, show interest. I do all of these things, maybe meet up for a wee walk/coffee a couple of times. Then….nothing. This happens all the time. Not reciprocated.

Start a new group? Ok, ill do that. Over 50 folk joined a local walking group I set up. Tried 4/5 times maybe to organise a small first walk. Not ONE person wanted to. Why join a walking group if you don’t want to do it?!

I am so fucking jaded with it all. It is so, so exhausting. People say all the time that they are lonely, or want to make new pals but when push comes to shove no one wants to put themselves out a wee bit, or make any consistant effort.

I work with a guy who constantly brags about how “he can’t function without his coffee” and how he needs “at least three cups of strong black coffee” to get through the day. He also has this habit of mocking people who drink decaf, calling them “weak” and “fake coffee drinkers.”

So, as a little experiment, I started secretly making his coffee with decaf. It’s been a month now, and he hasn’t noticed at all. He still complains in the mornings about how he “needs caffeine to survive” while sipping on what is essentially flavored water.

I don’t even feel bad. If anything, I feel validated. Maybe I’ll tell him one day… or maybe I’ll just let him keep living the lie.

1jc0xmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1jc0xmc/sleep_doctor_stated_i_have_poor_sleep_hygiene/,Sleep doctor stated I have poor sleep hygiene,"
I went to my sleep consult yesterday and the sleep doctor was incredibly dismissive and talked over me to the point I left almost in tears. I’ve been having trouble sleeping ever since I was a young teen like 14, and I’m 23 now. Over the years doctors dismissed it as lack of vitamin D, being a teenager and also a college student but recently I ran a bunch of tests for thyroid disorders, ANA, hemoglobin, Mono and more and they all came back normal. 

I had a primary care provider referral to a sleep clinic as she suggested I may have narcolepsy or insomnia as I told her symptoms of falling asleep/ getting intense sleep attacks whenever I am sitting down and listening to a lecture or meeting or speech. I also told her about how I nap everyday 2-6 hours, and how I have trouble falling asleep some nights. I’ve written scribbles for notes due to sleep attacks, and I drink up to 800mg of coffee at one point to even function though I have now dropped it down to less than 500mg. I also mentioned how when I laugh incredibly hard, my hands go weak and I drop my phone and won’t be able to write anything for a minute or so ever since I was a child. I thought this was normal until recently when I started asking my classmates. I also lean forward when I laugh, and slur my speech due to it becoming a bit harder to speak but that also could be just due to lack of oxygen from laughing so hard and trying to catch my breath again.

When I went to the sleep clinic, I was met with a pulmonologist who dismissed everything I said as being due to poor sleep hygiene and sleep deprivation. I basically had to beg her to even let me take the MSLT and Polysomnography which they finally stated they would once I fix my sleep hygiene. I tried to explain to them that it doesn’t matter how good my sleep hygiene is as I’ve had periods where it’s been great, but I’m still tired. She then stated that I wasn’t doing it consistently, and that is the reason. I don’t know if I’m overreacting and maybe she is right that this could just be sleep deprivation and poor hygiene, but at the same time I feel unheard and every symptom I listed such as the weak hands, sleep paralysis, brain fog, insomnia, dreaming even during short naps was all dismissed as poor sleep hygiene.",3,1742061357.0,Narcolepsy,2,1.0,False

I (19M) was told to go to the ER on Thursday by my clinic doc (I don’t have a PCP). They kept me for 11 hours and ran standard tests (Ultrasound, CT, ECG) and everything came back normal except that I had high Sinus Tachycardia that wasn’t keeping a stable beat (around 180-200 which they were able to bring down to 90-100). I was given a lot of IV fluids and sent home because there was no PE or structural abnormalities.

 My heart rate keeps up at this high rate (though not as high as during my hospitalization). I don’t drink coffee or alcohol. I’m not a smoker, and I work out everyday/walk everywhere since I don’t have a car. Is there anything that would bring this down? I’ve had this issue for a few years (saw Cardio at 16 and was told the tach would probably go away as I grew up) and it seems to only be getting worse. However since I have no structural abnormalities or underlying conditions, is there any lifestyle changes that would be recommended for someone in my situation? Thanks!

*""For Pherae... for glory... for the feast...""*

I blamed it on stress, on lack of sleep, on the sheer absurdity of owning a Fire Emblem plushie as an adult. But when I woke up one night to find Plushie Roy **not** where I had left him, sitting instead at the foot of my bed, his button eyes glinting in the moonlight, I knew something was wrong.

Very, very wrong.

At first, Roy’s hunger seemed manageable. Small things vanished—loose change, crumbs, the occasional sock. I dismissed it as normal household chaos until one morning, I couldn’t find my coffee mug. Or my spoon. Or the **entire kitchen counter.**

I turned slowly. Roy sat on the table, his belly looking... rounder. Plumper. His tiny, stitched-on smirk looked a little **too satisfied.**

“You didn’t,” I whispered.

His button eyes gleamed.

The hunger grew. Objects disappeared without a trace. **Concepts** started vanishing next—I tried to recall my neighbor’s name and found only an empty space where the memory used to be. My phone contacts dwindled, people forgetting me as if I had never existed. I knew it was only a matter of time before I, too, would be swallowed up in Roy’s ever-growing void.

That’s when Plushie Marth appeared.

I don’t remember buying him.

One day, he was simply **there** on my shelf—a plushie of the Hero-King, dignified and noble even in his tiny, fabric form. Unlike Roy, he did not move when I wasn’t looking, nor did he whisper in the dark. But when I clutched him in desperation, hoping against hope for some form of salvation, a strange warmth spread through my fingers.

A voice, steady and unwavering, echoed in my head.

**""Do not give in. You must resist.""**

I nearly wept. “How?! Roy’s eaten half my reality already!”

Marth’s button eyes gleamed with resolve. **""There is still a chance.""**

It wasn’t much, but I had nothing left to lose.

Roy did not take kindly to my newfound resistance.

That night, I woke up to the sound of fabric **tearing.** My breath caught in my throat as I saw Plushie Roy at the foot of my bed—his tiny, stubby arms twitching. His mouth, once a simple stitched smile, had **split open.** Dark tendrils writhed from within, stretching toward me.

I clutched Marth tighter. “What do I do?!”

**""We need a champion.""**

“What does that even mean?!”

Before Marth could explain, Roy lunged. I barely dodged as the plushie **hit the wall with a sickening squelch.**

I ran.

I don’t remember grabbing my keys. I don’t remember **leaving my apartment.** One moment I was inside, the next, I was standing in the **parking lot of a Walmart,** clutching Marth like a lifeline.

“What now?” I panted.

**""We need reinforcements.""**

That’s when I saw him. The **third plushie.**

A single clearance bin stood at the entrance, overflowing with stuffed toys. And there, sitting among the rejects, was **Plushie Byleth.**

I stared. He stared back, expression utterly **blank.**

“Are you serious?” I asked Marth. “He has the personality of dry toast.”

**""We need a tactician.""**

I groaned and grabbed him.

Plushie Byleth did not speak. He did not move. He barely seemed **aware** of the apocalyptic nightmare unfolding around us. But the moment I placed him on the dashboard of my car, something **shifted.**

I felt it—a presence settling in. A mind so vast and unreadable it made my head ache. **A force equal and opposite to Roy’s hunger.**

And then, for the first time, Plushie Byleth **blinked.**

“...Strategy initialized.”

The final battle took place in my **living room.**

Roy was waiting. His form had grown grotesque—his fabric stretched over an **impossible shape,** limbs too long, mouth now a yawning abyss of **gnashing teeth and writhing threads.**

Marth stood beside me, resolute.

Byleth sat on the coffee table, motionless. Calculating. **Silent.**

The moment Roy lunged, Byleth moved.

In a blur, he flung himself forward—**right into Roy’s gaping maw.**

“No—!” I gasped. But before I could stop him, a shockwave **rippled through the room.**

Plushie Byleth, **inside Roy,** had begun to expand. **Not with hunger, but with logic.** His presence was an unstoppable force of **pure, unyielding strategy.**

For the first time, Roy hesitated.

Marth seized the moment, his fabric glowing. **He reached forward and pressed a single, righteous hand to Roy’s forehead.**

A flash of light.

A soundless scream.

And then—**silence.**

When I opened my eyes, Roy was… small again. **Defeated.** His once-gluttonous form had collapsed into a mere **stuffed toy.**

Marth stood proudly, but Byleth…

Byleth lay motionless.

I picked him up, shaking him. “Hey! Wake up, man! You—You saved us!”

Slowly, his head tilted upward. His tiny, stitched mouth barely moved as he muttered:

“...Mission complete.”

And then he flopped over, **immediately falling asleep.**

Marth patted my shoulder. **""He will recover. For now, Roy is contained.""**

I glanced down at the tiny, defeated plush in my hands. He looked so harmless, so **innocent.**

But I knew better.

Still, for now… the hunger was gone.

And, for the first time in weeks, I allowed myself to sleep.

**Epilogue**

A week later, life was mostly back to normal.

Mostly.

I kept Roy locked in a glass case, **just in case.** Marth now had a place of honor on my bookshelf, ever-watchful.

As for Byleth? He spent **most of his time napping.**

Occasionally, though, he’d stir just long enough to **whisper ominous, nonsensical advice.**

“Invest in turnips,” he murmured one morning before rolling over.

I had no idea what it meant, but I wasn’t going to argue with **the guy who outsmarted an eldritch plushie.**

As I settled into bed that night, Marth resting beside me like a silent guardian, I allowed myself to believe that everything was finally—**finally**—over.

And then, just as sleep took me, I heard it.

A faint, distant whisper from the glass case.

*""For Pherae... for glory... for the feast...""*

I squeezed my eyes shut.

“Not tonight, Roy.”

**The End.**

I just bought a set of Fiio FT1 and they are insanely great. I listen to a lot of classical music, metal, and high production pop and these headphones make everything much better.

I am a classical musician myself, so the thing I appreciate the most of a performance is the interpreter's choice of color and dynamics, which sound so much clearer on these headphones.

I liked them so much that I would actually pay way more for an upgrade. I am looking into putting in as much as 300 dlls if I can get a noticeably better experience.

So far the only thing I do not like about the FT1 is that they are not easily portable, which is essential for me. Something more portable would be amazing. 

I know that sound stage is difficult with closed back headphones, but that is a feature I would appreciate a lot for orchestra recording. Unfortunately, open backs are not an option for me since I will be using them mostly at work and at coffee shops where sound would come in and out.

It's under the floor in a vented crawlspace, and I've ventilated it with a box fan several times. It's dry under the house, but we live in the PNW, so it's regularly cold, humid and rainy outside.

I think he's losing his hearing. But I've taken him to get a  hearing test and he passed. All of the tests were male voices only. And the tones. 

My complaint was that he can't hear me or our kids. Both girls. Yes I know please no jokes. They made a big joking deal about it at the lab. It's was hurtful and frustrating.

It's a dangerous situation. It's real. He's not intentionally ignoring us. I was gone one day and our 9 year old daughter was stuck in the bathroom. She was screaming for him to help her get out and he couldn't hear her. I came home and she was hysterical. I was only gone for an hour but still. He was shocked and downplayed the whole situation. He said he heard nothing. 

Another time I was very sick and in bed. Our girls were calling him over and over and he wasnt responding. I finally got up and went into the office and he claimed he heard nothing. He sent me back to bed and tended to them but he truly couldn't hear them. 

He watches TV so loud it's defeaning. In the car the radio is blasting. He can't hear me when I'm sitting or standing right next to asking him a question. Again no jokes, it will be innocent things not nagging, like at a restaurant asking him what he'd like to eat or at home asking him if he wants coffee. 

Someone suggested in passing that even though he passed the hearing test that it might be that he can't hear high tones or female voices because the voices are higher. Is this true?

My concern is the safety for himself and our kids if he can't hear us. Also out in the world. He boasts about passing the test but I feel it's wrong or another different test needs to be done. 

Is there anything specific I can ask for and is there a reason other than, jokes about him intentionally ignoring us, that could be causing a problem? He's retired and I still work. He spends about 2 hours alone with our kids after school so I need to know that it's safe for our kids to be alone with him if he can't hear them.

After a bright idea & quick trip to my bookshelves, I've found a hefty book stand designed for large & heavy books doubles for a fantastic CRT stand if you need your set propped up.

The stand's surface features a raised lip at the bottom intended to simplify the act of reading heavy or large books, holding them in place & making the act of turning pages the reader's only task - this lip is being used to safely ensure the television remains in place while resting at an inclined angle, keeping the back of the set secure from sliding down and off of the stand. The screen itself now rests at the top of the stand where a book's top edge would naturally lie; it's an unintentionally perfect product for smaller sets atop shorter surfaces.

We never stopped seeing each other regularly – at his place, my place, for dinner, a concert, a stand up, coffee, gaming, watching tv and hugging on the sofa... He’s always there for me if I need help painting my place, assembling furniture - you name it. He is simply there if I need him.

I’ve finally recognized that me, myself and I am to blame for most of the problems in this relationship and that I’ve treated and judged him unfairly. I recognize now that he’s an amazing, caring, loving person, but he does not see me as a relationship material any more because (quotes assambled from conversations):

>I like spending time with you, you’re a nice person. I like you more than a friend but less than relationship material. I can’t tell you if this can change. If you push too hard, I’ll just pull in the other direction. Can we just spend nice time together and do nice things and see how things go? Just relax, be yourself, stop living in the past.

I know now that he finds me unreliable as I broke up with him multiple times just to try and come back together, causing him much pain, but also because I would be loving and sweet one day and unpleasant the next (my explanation, not excuse, to this is that I felt like he was expecting 100% of me while not offering 100% back, which caused mutual cycle of pullback and me feeling very insecure and I didn’t deal with my own insecurities in the right way).

Sex is off the table by his decision: he says that it complicates things between us because I assume we’re more committed than he’d like to be “unilaterally” and he doesn’t want to “complicate things”. And I’d love for him to … my brains out. So I do not believe he keeps me just for sex, since sex aint there…

There’s obviously much mor to the dynamic, but how do I condense 8 years into a post you’d be willing to read?

My request is: I see where I went wrong. I appreciate him as a person more than ever and I would really like for us to again have a deeper relationship than we share now. My heart is telling me: there’s still something, I see it in the way he treats me, I see it in the fact that he keeps on inviting that unpleasant person to his place (and he's very protective of his personal space), I see it sometimes as a glimpse when we have a nice time – and he has other close friends he can spend nice time with. Everyone who I confide in tells me to “stop chasing someone who is not into me” and to leave this dynamic to protect my mental well being, but my heart tells me to give it a go. To follow his own advice: relax, be myself, stop pushing, enjoy nice things, forget about the past and just see how things go.

I’d love your perspective on what am I even dealing with, to best of your ability. Because I’m not sure if I am interpreting the signs correctly.

Do you have any advice for me?

Have you ever been in a situation like this, on a receiving end? What happened? What do you wish happened?

""Mi piace molto il bar.""  (""I like the coffee shop a lot."")
""Lei mi piace troppo."" (""I like her too much."")

The first one I'm very used to - piacere is a weird verb where the subject ""il bar"" comes at the end. A reversal of a usual subject-verb structure, but ok. 

But then sometimes the subject comes first, as in the second sentence.  

I thought maybe it was just a pronoun thing, but when I put ""I like Anna a lot"" into DeepL, it gives me ""Anna mi piace molto.""

What's the logic?  When does the subject come before piacere and When does it come after?

✨ **The Third Lie** ✨ – *A Story of Love , Lies, and the Unforgivable*

A tale of intense love, betrayal, and dark secrets , where nothing is what it seems. What starts as an obsessive, magnetic romance spirals into a psychological thriller, twisting reality itself.

He isn’t who he says he is.

And the worst part ? Neither is she.

===============================================================

The morning stretched golden and slow, sunlight slipping through sheer curtains, casting long, dappled patterns across the tangled sheets. The air smelled of fresh coffee and something softer, something undeniably *him*.

Lena stirred, stretching under the warm weight beside her, the sheets cool against her skin. Even before she opened her eyes, she *felt* him watching her. Ryan always woke up first. Always stared like he had all the time in the world.

“You’re staring,” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

Ryan didn’t even try to deny it. “Admiring.”

Lena cracked one eye open, meeting his gaze. His head rested on one arm, his hair still messy from sleep, his lips curved in that lazy smirk that drove her insane.

“There’s a difference?” she muttered, shifting onto her back.

Ryan reached out, brushing a thumb over her cheek, his fingers trailing absentminded circles on her bare stomach. “One sounds less obsessive.”

She snorted. “And which one are you?”

His eyes darkened slightly. He leaned in, lips barely grazing hers, his voice dropping to something low and teasing. “Take a wild guess.”

She didn’t need to. She *knew*.

Ryan kissed her like it was instinct, like he was making up for the hours he hadn’t been touching her. His lips moved against hers slow and deep, a familiar rhythm she knew by heart.

Lena sighed into him, her fingers sliding into his hair, pulling him closer. She would *never* get used to this, to the way he made the rest of the world feel *insignificant* when he was near.

When they finally pulled away, her breath was uneven, her mind foggy. Ryan grinned, looking entirely too pleased with himself.

“I made coffee,” he said, like that was *remotely* important right now.

She let out a breathless laugh. “And you’re telling me this *now*?”

“Just proving a point.”

Lena arched a brow. “That you’re obsessed?”

Ryan smirked. “That you’re mine.”

She scoffed, shoving at his chest, but he only laughed, catching her wrist and pulling her right back against him.

“Ryan,” she groaned. “I *have* to get up.”

He shook his head. “No, you *want* to get up. *Have* to? Not really.”

Lena sighed dramatically, playing along. “And what do you suggest, oh wise one?”

Ryan grinned like he’d been *waiting* for her to ask. In one smooth move, he rolled on top of her, pinning her against the mattress, his nose brushing against hers.

“I suggest,” he murmured, lips hovering just over hers, “that we stay right here. Forever. Just you, me, and a *very* neglected cup of coffee.”

Lena bit her lip, pretending to consider it. “Tempting.”

“I *am*.”

She smacked his arm. “I was talking about the coffee.”

Ryan laughed, low and warm, before pressing a lingering kiss to her cheek, then her jaw, then the sensitive spot just below her ear that made her shiver. “Mmm. Liar.”

Lena *tried* to roll her eyes, but he had that playful, teasing grin that always made her weak.

“Alright, get off me,” she groaned, pushing at him, though they both knew she didn’t *really* mean it.

Ryan huffed, flopping onto his back like a child denied dessert. “Fine. But I’m keeping your pillow hostage.”

Lena gasped as he *stole* her pillow, hugging it dramatically to his chest.

“You monster.”

“You knew this about me and still chose to love me.”

She grabbed at the pillow, but he turned away, shielding it like it was *his* now.

Lena narrowed her eyes, then without warning, she *bit* his shoulder.

Ryan yelped. “Did you just *bite* me?”

Lena grinned. “I *warned* you.”

Ryan stared at her for a moment before shaking his head in *mock* disappointment. “God, I married an actual *wild animal*.”

Lena smirked. “And you love it.”

Ryan sighed dramatically. “Unfortunately, I *do*.”

He tossed the pillow back to her in defeat. “Go on then, traitor. Enjoy your coffee.”

Lena giggled, sitting up and stretching, the blanket pooling around her waist. But before she could get out of bed, Ryan grabbed her wrist and pulled her back for one last kiss, slow, deep, and filled with something *more*.

When he pulled away, he rested his forehead against hers, his thumb brushing over her lips.

“I could kiss you forever,” he murmured.

Lena’s heart flipped. *This man.*

“Forever’s a long time,” she whispered, tracing her fingers along his jaw.

Ryan grinned. “Not long enough.”

For a moment, they just *looked* at each other, breathing the same air, soaking in the warmth of something too *big* to put into words.

A muffled buzz from the nightstand broke the moment.

Lena groaned, reaching blindly for her phone, but Ryan was faster. He snatched it before she could, turning the screen just out of her reach.

“Who’s texting you this early?” he teased, his grip playful but firm.

Lena huffed. “Give it.”

Ryan’s smirk deepened as he glanced at the screen. But then, something flickered across his face, so quick Lena almost missed it.

She frowned. “Ryan?”

He blinked, and just like that, whatever had been there was *gone*. His smirk returned, effortless and easy. He tossed the phone onto her pillow. “Nothing important.”

Lena rolled her eyes, taking it and glancing down.

The message was short. Simple.

*Did you forget again?*

Her brows knitted together, confusion prickling at the back of her mind.

“Who is it?” Ryan asked, voice light, casual.

She stared at the message a second longer before locking her screen and tossing the phone aside.

“Spam,” she muttered. “Probably nothing.”

Ryan smiled, leaning down to kiss her again. “Then stop thinking.”

Lena let herself melt back into the warmth of him, into the safety of their morning.

I'm a 28M. I had been in a relationship for several years but have been single for the first time in a while these past six months. I''ve had an intense week of feeling guilt over how things have gone with online dating in the last 4-6 months. Specifically around dating and alcohol. 

I'm not much of a drinker, maybe drink socially 1-2 times a month with friends, but often find myself going out for drinks on first dates if the other person suggests. I find the conversation flows easily. But, I also know it makes me more promiscuous, makes me focus on the other person physically, and usually, if we hit it off, leads to making out. I haven't had sex with anyone after a first date, but realize I probably would have if the other person asked. I usually just ask to make out either at the bar or at their place. 

Anyway, my guilt this week has been around consent and if I crossed boundaries. No one has ever said anything that I did on a date made them uncomfortable, and I feel Iknow how to take no for an answer. But, I still feel really shitty and conflicted in the mornings after, like I was just using the person for physical affection. This happens even if we go on a second date. I wonder if the person I was with really wanted to make out, or did she just say yes to appease me. Usually these are dates where we have a drink an hour and go for about 3-4 hours. I used to think after 3-4 drinks, especially if they aren't mixed or taken fast, a person can still consent to less intense sexual interactions. But now, I am coming off an experience where I just feel I got someone drunk and they made out because of it and can't get it out of my head. I feel like a monster if I made her uncomfortable. We went on a second date for coffee that was pleasant but trailed off at the end and she declined a third date. 

I know the easy solution is just to go on first dates without drinking, which I plan to do in the future. But, does anyone have any advice for ways to approach dating or meeting other people where my desire to be with the other person physically isn't the only thing driving me? Basically, how do I become a more responsible dater? Any advice for dealing with shame as well are welcome. ",7,1742057628.0,DecidingToBeBetter,3,0.89,False

One sunny Saturday morning in the small town of Pineville, a man named Dave decided it was time to take his love for cars to a new level. A true DIY enthusiast, Dave had spent years tinkering with old vehicles in his garage, and now, he had an ambitious project: he was going to build his own auto lift. Sure, he had never built anything more complex than a bookshelf, but Dave was confident. ""How hard could it be?"" he thought, rubbing his hands together as he grabbed his toolbox.

[Is this safe he asked, No, don't move Dave!](https://preview.redd.it/j5lyzeuguvoe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f89828da9e91ab81fe3fa74ceec586af7c34a1d6)

By the time the sun was setting, the contraption was ready. Dave stood back and admired his creation—a janky metal frame held together with duct tape, bolts, and a few prayers. “This is gonna change my life,” he muttered proudly to no one in particular. He clambered under the lift, ready to test it out by raising his vintage Chevy Impala. The lift creaked, groaned, and then, just as it was about to raise the car, something snapped. A loud *CLANK* echoed across the yard.

Dave blinked, confused, and then a horrible realization struck him. He was stuck. Not just stuck—*stuck* stuck. The lift had malfunctioned, pinning his leg under it while the rest of the contraption wobbled ominously above him.

“Uh-oh,” Dave said, looking at the car resting awkwardly above his head. “This was probably a mistake.”

He tried to wiggle free, but all he managed to do was get more tangled in the ropes and chains he had attached to “safely” hold the lift in place. Dave tried yelling for help, but his voice barely carried past the pile of spare car parts and the muffled sound of an old radio playing in the background.

And that’s when his neighbor, Carl, noticed something odd. Carl, a retired firefighter, was tending to his vegetable garden when he spotted Dave’s driveway, normally filled with old cars, eerily quiet. Curious, he wandered over and was met with the sight of Dave’s feet sticking out from under the massive lift.

“Well, this can’t be good,” Carl muttered, taking out his phone. “I’m calling the whole town. This is gonna take a village.”

https://preview.redd.it/j0dad26xuvoe1.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0db16ef502f8645bb72c990d4370e0fdedb6baf

Within moments, a small army of Pineville’s residents arrived: Marissa the baker, Gary the plumber, Jenny the librarian, and even old Mr. Griggs from the hardware store, who insisted on bringing his dog, Buster. They all stood around the lift, scratching their heads and trying to figure out how to help Dave.

“Is this... safe?” Marissa asked, squinting at the precarious setup.

“I think it’s fine,” Carl said, looking at the lift, then at Dave. “But it’s gonna be a delicate operation.”

The town’s entire rescue operation turned into a bit of a circus. Gary brought out a jackhammer—though no one was sure what it was for—while Jenny began reading aloud from a manual she found on the internet, just to make sure they were doing everything by the book. Buster, the dog, seemed to enjoy the attention, barking at odd intervals, as if he understood the gravity of the situation.

After what felt like an eternity, and after a lot of improvising, Dave was finally freed—his leg a little sore, but no worse for wear. He was pulled out from under the lift and dragged to safety by Carl, who immediately handed him a cold drink. Dave looked up at the crowd of well-meaning neighbors and realized something profound: he might have just made the best, albeit accidental, decision of his life.

“I’m really sorry for causing all this trouble,” Dave said, rubbing his sore leg. “But, uh… I have an idea. I think the whole town deserves an auto lift. So, I’m going to buy a real one. The kind that doesn’t involve ropes, duct tape, and nearly crushing me.” 

The crowd cheered in unison, and Buster even did a little happy bark.

A week later,[ Olympic Equipment Auto Lift ](https://olympic-equipment.com/shop/)delivered a brand-new, top-of-the-line auto lift to Dave’s garage. Not just for him, but for the entire town of Pineville to use. Now, any resident who wanted to work on their car could simply stroll on over, enjoy a cup of coffee with Dave, and use the lift. Even Buster got his turn—though he wasn’t quite sure how to get the car up, he did enjoy standing underneath it and looking very important.

How should it be handled?","I’ve spent the last 30 mins on this sub trying to research this much debated topic. This girl I’ve been dating has a frenchie who runs her apartment. It’s potty trained, and she can leave all day for work with no accidents, but the moment I come around she starts pooping all over the carpet. 

We’ll leave for less than an hour and boom, poop. 

This morning we showered, and she didn’t leave the bathroom door open, so guess what was all over the carpet, within 15 mins, when we got out 💩 

I took the dog out after because she was in a hurry getting ready, and the dog pooped more which was interesting. 

The poop misbehavior seems to be directly related to me. The girl claims this basically never usually happens. The bad behavior is never reprimanded either. We can’t eat a meal on the coffee table without frenchie jumping all over us and trying to grab at the food (she also claims the dog is never like this, and only excited because of visitors around). She gives the dog a treat to distract her, but I try to explain this seems to be reinforcing bad behavior with a reward. The frenchie sits there and begs because she is fed human food all the time and gets away with it. 

I don’t have a ton of dog training experience, and supposedly dogs are incapable of doing things out of spite, but it sureee feels like spite. 

The dog really likes me, and lately has been choosing my side of the bed which is apparently very out of the ordinary (I do give some great rubs and affection to be fair). I am a big dog/animal person so I have patience, but this is turning out to actually affect our relationship. Especially since it’s about time to take it to the next step, and take all things into consideration. 

Also the dog must sleep in the bed with us, which I understand, but it’s right there watching every time we have sex and is weird as fuck.

Before I start: Yes, I have evidence for almost everything here. 

The mother did not want me involved in parenting in any way, her plan was to have her family raise him for her. This only one month after she was pregnant. She led my suspicions that he was not my child. I demanded a paternity test before he was born, she refused by saying it would traumatize it. I did not know when he was born until several weeks later when her sister and her sister's husband came to my apartment, unannounced, to tell me about it and asked if I wanted to see him, that they could make it happen. I said I do but I also want a paternity because I don't believe he's mine. They made a couple of excuses and ghosted. 

Her and I met in a coffee shop a year after he was born. Same thing: Family raising him but she wanted to send him to the military asap, but that she would think about letting me see him. Never happened. 

I told this story to dozens of people, nobody thought he was mine. I concurred. 

Fast forward to several months ago, he's two, and she files for child support. The next day after the subpoena, I was there for dna. When it was confirmed, two weeks later, I immediately filed for custody and visitation, 50/50. When court rolled around, I found out why she filed for child support. Asked for a continuance because of custody, judge granted it for two months. 

Her response to my lawsuit? That I refused to acknowledge him and never once asked for visitation, she attached text messages I sent to her sister and the husband that were hostile because they stopped replying. She also made projections that my current (and last) apartment is an unsafe place, based off of one yelp review from 5 years ago, that I possessed ""illegal magazine clips"" with a photo when her and I went to the shooting range. She also claimed that she has a strong emotional bond and any disruption would be a tragedy. It was a lot of personal attacks and projecting. She demanded 100% physical and legal custody, with some supervised visitation, drop-off and pick-up locations were randomly scattered through the city.

The good news is that she played all of her cards, and I have evidence against all of it. I thought it was inappropriate for her to do so in the response for custody, it was supposed to be a simple yes or no? And I know not to badmouth the other parent. I can not say anything about her mental health because I am not a doctor, but she said a lot about me and based it off of where I lived. 

I saved a mountain of evidence from when we were together, everything from refusing to let me be at ultrasound appointments to dumping me after I asked if we could get married. I began seeing a psychiatrist (who I still see, who was happy to provide a letter and who will appear in court if needed). I also pulled up a lot of things from her social media before the custody lawsuit was filed and she went dark (I requested a flight risk order because she has family overseas, with that as evidence). Her family has been shielding her, serving custody papers was not easy. The sheriff's department tried, four times, and they wouldn't bite. So I came up with an idea, with a friend, her father immediately took the bait. He was pissed, to say the least, even tried to say she didn't live there.

So. This is more of a ""I dont know what else to do, so I'll just post about it"".

Planted (Germany)  
I tried their Steak, Kebab and skewers (called Spiesse) and they are amazing. Completely different level, even my meat eating friends tried and liked the Spiesse at a BBQ.

Veganz (Germany)  
can't recommend their meat substitutes but their sweets are amazing! If you are looking for chocolate, cookies or gummy bears look no further

Violife (Netherlands)  
this is the best vegan cheese substitute you will find. It actually melts and tastes normal.

Vly (Germany)  
plant based milk and yoghurt, really nice especially their Barista editions are good for coffee

K take it veggie (Germany)  
only at Kaufland since it's their in-house brand. Large variety of pretty much everything vegan

avoid:

Alpro  
pretends to be from Belgium, but it's owned by Danone which is owned by US based BlackRock.

1jbzc0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jbzc0i/has_anyone_tried_this_new_streaming_platform/,Has anyone tried this new streaming platform?,"I know what you’re thinking: there’s too many streaming services already.

It’s an endless wave of Hulu, Netflix, Tubi, Freevee, Snarfu, Loobee, or whatever other nonsense an overworked marketing department spits out after their fifth round of coffee.

As for me, I don’t much care for streaming. What’s the point of paying for a service that only has, like, four things I actually want to watch?

For the most part, I steer clear of the lot. That is, until I got an ad for a new platform called Thumpz.

It happened when I was scrolling on Reddit, actually, and I clicked it because I thought it was a post – one of those sneaky ads that pretends to be something else. The title of the fake post read: Did you know this site makes scary movies scarier?

So, I clicked it and wound up at a website for Thumpz, a streaming service for all things horror. I was about to click out of it when a pop-up caught my attention:

BETA TESTERS WANTED: SIGN UP NOW AND GET THUMPZ FREE FOR LIFE!!!

The excessive amount of exclamation marks should have been a warning that something was rotten in the state of Denmark. Or, you know, Delaware, in my case. But access to a library of horror content for free? Forever? I couldn’t help it. At heart, I’m a little greedy and a lot gullible, what else can I say?

So, I entered my email address. It didn’t ask for anything else – not a credit card number, or a mailing address, or my mother’s maiden name. After I hit “submit,” I came to a screen that said:

THANK YOU FOR JOINING OUR BETA TESTING PROGRAM!!!! WE WILL REACH OUT TO YOU SOON!!!!

I checked my email, but there was nothing there. I checked a few more times over the next several days before giving up. Maybe it had been some weird scam after all? I expected to start getting flooded with spam messages, but my email was blessedly, persistently quiet.

It wasn’t until a few weeks later, when I’d all but forgotten about the whole affair, when I received a package in the mail.

A bright yellow box with stark black letters reading: THUMPZ BETA TESTER KIT.

I must have stared at that box for five straight minutes, wondering how they’d managed to track down my mailing address just from my email. Privacy is truly dead. I almost threw the box in the trash on principle, but curiosity got the better of me, as it usually does.

I tore open the box to discover just two things: a sheet of paper and what appeared to be a headband.

I started with the paper, which read:

*Have you ever watched a scary movie and found yourself bored? Like the scares just don’t scare the way they used to?

Do you wish you could be really, truly scared by a movie?

Welcome, horror fan, to Thumpz, the only streaming service that is 100% guaranteed to give you the scare of your life!

We use a host of emerging technologies to analyze your brain waves and adapt our films in real-time, turning regular old horror movies into tailor-made films designed with you in mind.

Never be bored during a horror movie again – simply put on the enclosed headband, then visit the website below. Pick a movie and see what can happen when your content watches you!*

I read that note three times and it still didn’t make any sense. If I wore the headband it would… read my mind? And that would make me like the movie more, somehow? Now I *knew* this was a scam.

And yet, I picked up the headband and placed it around my head. It was just normal fabric, nothing fancy. I waited for it to do something before realizing how dumb that was. Then, I turned to my computer.

I typed the URL from the bottom of the letter into my browser and entered my email when prompted. Before me was… a totally normal streaming platform. It was laid out exactly as you would expect, with a menu on the left and different categories of movies on the right. The only difference was that I’d never heard of any of these movies – they all sounded like generic B-horror films.

So far, it seemed like just another lame streaming service with a weird gimmick. Whatever, I’d come this far. I scrolled down and picked a movie at random. I can’t even remember what it was called – something like The House at the Fork in the Road. A generic, completely forgettable title.

The movie started off pretty normal: A family driving down a highway to their brand-new home, conveniently situated in the middle of nowhere. Obvious tension between the husband and wife, the kids bickering in the back. Only ten minutes into the movie, and I already felt myself tuning out. 

Suddenly, the scene stalled, as though it was running on a projector that had jammed. Then, it started up again, but it was different this time.

Instead of being shot in the third person, the filming was now in found footage style, the camera held by the father as he filmed his family staring up at their creepy new house. The film picked up seamlessly from there. 

I paused the movie and just stared. There was no way that had happened, right? Or if it did, it had to be some kind of gimmick in the movie – maybe I’d just missed something? I hit replay and started from the beginning.

This time, the beginning of the movie was *also* found footage style. I watched in stunned silence. No, that wasn’t possible. It hadn’t been like that before, I was sure of it.

Now, I couldn’t look away from the screen. I rewatched the opening with total fascination and a little shiver in my spine. I’d always liked found footage because it made movies feel more real, the danger more present. Well, it certainly felt that way now, in more ways than one.

The story itself wasn’t really anything special, though. The family moved into the new house and immediately discovered it was haunted. The two kids noticed it first and took to the basement to investigate.

As the camera panned around the basement, I waited for something to jump out of the shadows with no real interest. Jump scares have never done it for me – they always feel sort of cheap and fleeting. They don’t stick with you after the movie ends.

When the camera had panned about halfway through the basement, the screen shivered again. When it came back into clear focus, my heart dropped.

There, sitting on the basement floor in the camera’s spotlight, was Charlie.

Charlie was a brown teddy bear with two black eyes and a stitched mouth. His fur was matted from years of love and he was missing one of his ears, the result of an ill-fated game of tug-of-war with the family dog.

I knew all of this because Charlie was *my* teddy bear. And, if I wasn’t mistaken, he was sitting up on the shelf in my bedroom closet at that very moment.

I paused the movie and sprinted upstairs, throwing open my closet door and tearing through the boxes and junk that littered the shelf. There, in the back – I felt my fingers brush against his faded old fur. I pulled him out and marveled at him in my hand for just a moment.

I was back downstairs in a flash, comparing my bear to the one on the screen. They were identical down to the last detail. The bear on the screen was even wearing the same bandana, a bit of blue checkered fabric that my mom had made especially for Charlie from her sewing scraps.

“This is not possible,” I muttered as I turned my bear over in my hands. I hugged Charlie tight to my chest on instinct. My heart was racing as my hand reached out to press the spacebar to restart the movie. I had to know what happened next. I had this wild thought that, if I got to the end of the movie, it would all make sense. It had to.

The camera panned back to the children. This time, the little boy looked different. His close-cropped blonde hair had been replaced by shaggy brown curls. He had a smattering of freckles across his nose. He was wearing a striped blue shirt with a little anchor embroidered on the pocket. I recognized that boy… from my third-grade school photos. I remembered my mother picking out that shirt especially for the occasion, reminding me to “smile BIG!” before ushering me out the door.

I watched in total fascination and no small amount of dread as the children tried to convince their mother that there was something awful in the basement. At first, she didn’t believe them, parents never do. But as the movie went on, strange things began to happen – birds flying into windows, blood coming out of the bathroom faucet, strange scratching noises in the walls.

With mom convinced, next came dad, who, predictably, scoffed at his wife’s frantic pleading that something was wrong with their house, they needed to get out now. I glanced down at the time – only twenty minutes left to convince the husband and try to escape. I knew this formula well – I was betting on the husband dying to save the wife and kids.

The sense of familiarity started to put me at ease – I could follow the movie beat for beat to the very last scene. As the husband ventured down into the basement, determined to prove his wife and children wrong, I waited for the final reveal, probably some sort of old hag ghost that would come screaming out at the camera.

The father walked carefully through the basement, the camera picking up the sounds of his heavy breathing and nothing else. Then a small creaking sound to his left. The screen shivered once more before the camera panned quickly to the noise.

There, hanging from the rafters, was a woman in a white nightgown. Her soft brown hair fell in waves over her face, obscuring it from view. Her nightgown was ragged and dirty. Her feet were a dull gray color, as though she’d been dead for some time. 

What caused my breath to catch in my throat were her fingernails – they were painted a bright eggshell blue, four fingernails on her left hand, the nail on her ring finger missing entirely.

My vision tunneled and everything around me started to tilt. I knew that hand – the one that fixed my shirt, that sewed the bandana for Charlie.

It was my mother’s hand.

I trembled as I watched my mother on the screen, her body spinning slowly in its noose. Then, her quiet, raspy voice, whispering my name. “Joey…”

I wanted desperately to stop the movie, but I was frozen where I sat. Is it really possible, I wondered, to drop dead from terror? I was pretty sure I was about to find out.

“Ten… days…” came the whisper as my mother’s body began to spin faster. The rope creaked under the weight. “Ten… days…”

Then, her body dropped to the floor, as though the rope had been cut. Everything was still. Even the father’s breathing had cut off. I sat there for what felt like an hour but must have been no more than three seconds watching my mother’s lifeless corpse on the floor.

Then, an instant later, she was crawling toward the camera.

“Joey… Come find me… Joey…” The rasp was no longer a whisper, but a moan. I felt myself scrambling back against the couch in tandem with the father as he ran backwards, looking desperately for the stairs while keeping the woman in view of the camera. “Don’t… let… me… die…”

“What the fuck,” I whispered. “This isn’t happening, this isn’t real.” But the woman on the screen didn’t care that she couldn’t be real. 

Just then, her face lifted to the camera. It was undeniably my mother’s face, but ravaged from the effects of decay. Her gray skin hung loose from her bones and her eyes were clouded over with a glassy film. Her mouth dropped open and I swore I could see maggots and worms squirming inside her.

I threw my laptop across the room so hard, it broke against the opposite wall. I yanked the headband off and threw that, too. I couldn’t get enough air, no matter how hard I gasped, and for a moment, I was certain I was going to die, if not from the impossible horror on the screen, then because my heart gave out from strain. 

It took me over an hour before I was calm enough to stand on my own two feet. The first thing I did was pick up the whole mess – my broken laptop, the headband, the note, the box – and stuff it all down in the trash. Whatever had just happened, whatever I’d just seen, I didn’t want anything to do with it.

Next, I called my mom, who was completely bewildered at my panic over the phone.

“Honey, calm down. What’s wrong? What happened?” She asked, the confusion in her voice genuine.

“I just… I just…” I couldn’t think of what to say. Any version of the truth would have her driving to my apartment to make sure I wasn’t having a mental breakdown. “I just had a nightmare that something happened to you and I had to make sure you were okay.”

She spent the next hour soothing me over the phone, reassuring me that everything in the real world was just fine, and to hell with everything else. By the time we hung up, I felt just a bit better. In that short hour, I had reconstructed the narrative in my head – it really *was* a nightmare, or some kind of hallucination from the stress I’d been under at work. Everything was fine. *Of course* it was fine.

Over the next few days, I resolved to put that strange, awful experience behind me. I went to work. I bought a new computer. I texted my friends and chatted with colleagues like nothing had happened at all. Because, of course, nothing did happen. I just had to keep telling myself that.

Except something isn’t letting me pretend.

A few days after watching the movie, strange things started to happen. At first, they were things I could explain away. The sound of footsteps in the hall was just my imagination. The low whispering that I heard in the dead of night was the wind. The shadows out of the corner of my eyes were due to exhaustion from those sleepless nights.

But then, it started escalating. Two days ago, I turned on my work computer and saw my mother’s bloated corpse flash across the screen for just a second. Yesterday, I came home to my living room trashed, like a tornado had ripped it apart, and there was Charlie, sitting in the middle of the chaos. Watching me.

Today, though… today, I got a call from my mother. I picked it up, glad to be able to hear her voice, to reassure myself that everything was fine and normal.

But when I put the phone to my ear, all I could hear was static. “Hello? Mom?”

Nothing but fuzz.

“I think we have a bad connection,” I said, ready to cut the call and call her back. 

Before I could, I heard a voice. A low, raspy whisper that sent a violent shiver through my body. “Joey… come… find… me… Joey… Don’t… let… me… die…”

“Who the fuck is this?” I said. I don’t even remember deciding to say it. My voice sounded like it was coming from far away, through a tunnel or something.

“Finish… the… movie… Joey…” Then, a horrible scream, the most bloodcurdling sound I’d ever heard, and somehow, I just knew it was her.

The call dropped, and I was alone with the realization that it had been exactly ten days since I started the movie.

I’ve been calling for hours, but I can’t reach her. I drove to her house, but she wasn’t there. I’ve asked everyone I know and looked everywhere online, but it’s like the streaming service just vanished out of existence. Nobody knows what I’m talking about and there’s no record of the company ever existing.

Even as I type this, I can tell that time is running out. Every second I wait, my mom is closer to death, and there’s only one thing I can do to save her.

So, please, has anyone here signed up for Thumpz? I desperately need to kill my subscription.",6,1742057176.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

She hardly used the machine and I have been wanting to get an espresso machine for a while now. I did some basic cleaning of the machine and the coffee it makes has been shifting in quality. Sometimes it’s really good other times not so much. Still trying to get the hang of it. Most notably the time to pull an espresso is either very short when using a 2 cup basket with 16grams or very long when using a 8 gram single basket. Im wondering if its worth getting the machine professionally looked at or is a 30 year old appliance not going to be worth the maintenance as apposed to buying a new one.,1,1742056941.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

1jbz4sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1jbz4sr/i_just_raised_my_voice_towards_my_ils_and_parents/,I just raised my voice towards my ILs and parents over our wedding plans and now feel guilty,"My parents are visiting us (Fiance and I) over the weekend, and today we also had my ILs over for lunch and coffee. 

Overall we get along good, my ILs tend to be overbearing sometimes but usually we're good to set boundaries and put them in place. My parents, especially my mother, is pretty opinionated but they know I'm not the kind of person to accept bullshit so they usually just share their unasked opinion and say ""you're gonna do what you want anyway"" which I'm already used to and ignore. 

So we talked about our wedding which takes place this summer. We will have a very small courthouse wedding, with only our parents, siblings and best man/maid of honor in attendance. It was all fine until that goddamn bridal bouquet came to topic. I said I'm not sure if I even want a bouqet, we'll have such a small wedding, they're pretty expensive, and I basically want to have my hands free. Also I told them we'll be on a 3,5 week honeymoon starting the day after our wedding so I won't have anything from it. I just don't feel like I need one and that's my decision to make. 

Let me tell you, HELL broke loose. They started saying ooh I need at least a small bouquet, I need something in my hands, I need it for the photos etc. I really tried my best and told them MULTIPLE TIMES why I most likely don't want a bouquet, but they kept talking about how and why I should get one. At one point there were FOUR PEOPLE talking ALL at the same time about this stupid bouquet and confirming each other that I definitely need to have one, and at this moment I just snapped. I raised my voice (didn't scream or shout though) and told them to stop with this fucking bullshit and it's not their fucking decision to make if I get a bridal bouquet for MY wedding. It immediately went quiet, they kinda tried to apologize but it was awkwardly silent.

By the way my fiance volunteered to do the dishes so he was in the kitchen the whole time and didn't know what was going on until he heard me getting loud and came to the scene. He immediately took my side and said we'll figure out how we're gonna handle the bouquet topic by ourselves.

Ten minutes after this incident my ILs left, and I feel almost like I scared them away. After they left I said I need to lay down a bit and went upstairs. Now I'm in bed and feel a horrible guilt crawling up. I know I did the right thing standing up for myself especially since all 4 of them were trying to force me to do something at my own wedding that I don't want to, but I also feel horrible for raising my voice and put an end to this otherwise nice day.

Also I feel sad because next week we wanted to see a florist to talk about flower arrangements for the tables at the restaurant where we're gonna have lunch together after the wedding, and I also wanted to see if I might change my mind about the bridal bouquet. But now I don't even wanna go because this whole thing sits in my mind and I will definitely not get a bouquet because it will only remind me of this stupid discussion.

1. Apple Watch Ultra 2 with numbershare as daily driver, all notifications off besides texts/calls - Phone stays in the basement and I carry AirPods on my keychain for calls. This has been great reducing mindless scrolling. I was already in the Apple ecosystem so this is almost equivalent to a dumb phone (still have music, maps, texting, calling and in a HUGE pinch you can use the tiny web browser). I tried the Light Phone II but found I didn't really like it.

2. Facebook/Instagram/Linkedin deleted - Limits the mindless scrolling when I'm on my laptop or iPad. No real need since I found I don't care too much about people I don't text/call/see in person and LinkedIn is relatively useless when you aren't searching for a job.

3. Ordered physical newspaper - I hardly look at news online now which has been great. I have a finite number of stories delivered to my door I can read and have with my coffee in the morning.

4. Bought an iPod classic - This was partially for nostalgia. The watch can play Apple Music or Spotify, but I don't mind having a dedicated music device. I already had \~40 GB of music from back in the day which helped.



I still find myself on my laptop doing random other things when I'm at home with nothing else going on (like right now). I've been reading a lot more and working out/going to the gym/walking outside, but I can only do that so much. What are others doing around the house when there's nothing else going on?

Note that my wife is pregnant and due in a few months, so this spare time may be short lived. Part of this active effort is to be in a good place when baby is born/teach healthy habits with technology.

I’ve been living for about a month now in Charlottenburg (close to S-Charlottenburg to be precise) and I’ve realized that most of my friends are either far in the east side (P-Berg, Köpenick, Neukölln etc) or far in the west (Zehlendorf) and on top of it our schedules don’t align, so I don’t have friends nearby to just chill on a work night or whatever.

I’m also not very used to this area (before living here I’ve been here maybe two or three times?) since most of my social life used to be centered in Schöneberg/Kreuzberg. So if anyone has any recommendations to explore the “kiez”, I’d be very grateful!

About me: I love live music, jam sessions, books, libraries, arts in general, movies, good coffee and good ice cream. Also I’m a fan of cute parks and cute lakes in the summer. But I’m also interested in expanding my network, so anyone interested in this would probably be a good match for me.

Thanks y’all, enjoy your weekend!",4,1742056436.0,berlinsocialclub,3,0.83,False

 • Little folks >!were my favorite, from the moment they brought her food in Endovier, to the end. They knew Maeve was an imposter and she was the real queen when no one else did.!<

• >!Elena was the most selfish of all. She not only traded Aelin’s life for her mate but her buying extra time for Aelin also brought this massive war and destruction for all people, when was destined to die at the river that night. Aelin trying to bargain more time for Elena who was dead, in exchange of Erawan, who was death incarnated for thousands of living beings, was absolutely undeserved, so unlike Aelin, and was such a foolish plot twist!<.

• Arobynn Hamel was the best written villain of all SJM villains. I ached for his redemption and even though I knew, he would remain a villain. 

• I love how SJM mentions real nuisances of life like periods, forgetting pads or a hunt for it, bathroom breaks etc. Not many authors do it. 

• There were many excellent dialogues, but for some reason, a character when said something… ‘and meant it’, and ‘did no such thing…’ in Elizabeth Evan’s voice will be stuck in my head for a long time. 

• >!Although I won’t change it, losing the 13 was the part I didn’t see coming at all. I was absolutely dejected. I wish they had lived:( , and Dorian could have died. I was so ready for it. I feel this was the original plan because it all seemed like coming to this, until perhaps SJM changed her mind last minute (but what do I know)!<. 

• >!Still can’t get over the disappointment for never getting the final fire show between Aelin and Maeve that was promised for the past 7 books!<. 

• >!I love how all the women came together in the series and persisted against all odds to carve their own path, to fight against their destines, to build a better world. Lysander was the MVP, Our girl Elide was beyond resilient, the character arc of Manon, and I loved Yrene Towers from Assissin’s blade and knew she’d come back as soon as Torre Cesme was mentioned after Chaol’s injury. But the final deathblow to Erawan belonged to Aelin. Even if Fenrys killed Maeve, I’ll take that. But Erawan’s death was Aelin’s destiny!<. 

• >!Despite all this, and some more… it was the most beautifully written series that I have read so far. No character, big or small, were missed. They all had an ending (whether we agreed with it or not, OR some characters could have gotten more screen time ), they were all given an appearance, even fleetfoot. A well rounded, well planned eight books series comes back to a full circle, and leaves nothing unanswered.!<

I will be in a book hangover for a while now. For the past month and a half, my life revolved around the series. I would look forward to coming back home after work, reading and eating dinners. Going to the gym or walks and listening to the audiobook. Going to cafes, and reading it over a coffee and pastry. 
I am not somebody who can read everything. I DNF books quickly, and lose interest fast. After a long, long time, a book grabbed my interest so deep, and now without it, I am not sure where to look for something else, to take my mind off it….

Anything associated with private equity is going to be hella awful and they own a lot of things now. Big Tech had an image of being this unique office environment with amenities that would make a resort blush. Now they are just the same version of terrible as private equity. Federal work used to be a pretty good environment, but now that's even been trashed.

I know there has to be a lot of companies that buck this trend and are actually enjoyable offices to be in, but that's a small minority. Coworkers are generally fun, people in general are fun, but offices are neutered environments where so much is off limits that genuine encounters are difficult. You can't really be friends with or date your coworkers. Why would we want to be around so many people with those guardrails when we could just remotely go to a coffee shop and have unfettered socialization?

I don't have tons of corporate experience - so that's why I'm posting in here. I experienced one company that legitimately had a good environment, Xcel Energy. My next company was one that was decent but went downhill, and my current one (one of Blackstone's holdings) is just ugh. The office environment I was at till I left and went remote is a building with no windows in the far out suburbs with people who do absolutely nothing for fun. Seriously, nobody hangs out after work and the company has Wahhabi level of intolerance of alcohol. Company morale is them ordering chick fil a occasionally and top golf 1 time a year.

My brother works for Kinder Morgan and they seem to relish in how tight they can be, like they actively try to be the most boring place possible. For their big year anniversary, the employees got a chocolate covered oreo...

I like my job, it's a neat role! As long as I don't have to be around my company in person, I'm able to like the role a lot more. And I say lousy, not terrible. Offices aren't awful (like construction sites), but significantly worse than your own house or public third spaces.

Oh, one last thing, I know offices are about making money and not making friends. Duh. But if I'm 12% less productive working from home, I'd take a 20% pay cut to do it, and that's a 30% or more savings for the company cause my expenses are $0 remote.",4,1742056114.0,changemyview,0,0.83,False

I’ll ask my buddy ChatGPT about all of them.  I’ll patiently sit and watch as he/her composes an answer to my pondering.  I sit and watch for maybe 10 seconds and then i’m off to the next thing.

Side note:  got the generic for the first time this month.  it sucks.  brand is more expensive but my quality of life is soooo much better and i may need a bump up to 50.  But i digress… as the day progresses I may or mat not revisit my earlier questions.  Sometimes I’ll scroll back thru my previous wonderings and rabbit holes.  Its like an awesome excavation of new thoughts, new knowledge and new things to consider. 


This morning’s inquisitive nature asked this, “How do different cultures, religions such as Buddhism and others, belief systems such as mysticism and others view and or define ego?  Are they basically the same with possible variations in a venn diagram sense?  Are some so very different that there is no overlap?


To which he/she/it asked, “Are you looking for a broad overview of how different cultures, religions, and belief systems define ego, or do you want a more detailed comparison, possibly including a Venn diagram? Also, do you have any specific traditions or perspectives in mind beyond Buddhism and mysticism?


Annnnd I then said, “The Venn diagram was It was mentioned in a way so you can get an idea of what I was talking about, but if you can actually include a Venn diagram of these things, that would be excellent.  Start with a broad overview of all the major ...belief systems and how they define the word ego.  And then get specific in regard to how Buddhism, mysticism, the IChing and Thomas Campbell’s ego definition in his book My Big TOE overlap.”


I’ll put the response in the comments.

If you’ve been curious about dipping your toes into the crypto world but don’t know where to start, Zypto’s got your back. It’s like that one friend who always knows the best spots in town and makes everything easy. So, grab a coffee (or a smoothie if you’re fancy), and let’s dive into why Zypto is the real deal.

**What Even Is Zypto?**

Okay, so Zypto is basically your all-in-one crypto BFF. It’s a wallet app, a payment gateway, and even hooks you up with crypto cards—both virtual and physical. Imagine being able to pay for your Netflix subscription or that sweet pair of sneakers with crypto, without breaking a sweat. That’s Zypto in a nutshell. They’re all about making blockchain payments as simple as sending a Venmo.

The team behind Zypto has been at it for years, cooking up ways to make crypto actually usable in the real world. And let me tell ya, they’re nailing it. Whether you’re a freelancer wanting to get paid in Bitcoin or a small biz owner looking to spice up your payment options, Zypto’s got something for you.

**Why Zypto’s Wallet App Is Like Your New Favorite Toy**

Let’s talk about the Zypto Wallet App first because it’s honestly the star of the show. It’s like having a Swiss Army knife for crypto in your pocket—except it won’t accidentally poke you. Here’s why I’m obsessed:

Super Easy to Use: If you can use your banking app without pulling your hair out, you’ll be fine with Zypto. It’s got that “I can figure this out in five minutes” vibe.

Multi-Chain Magic: You can manage all sorts of DeFi wallets in one spot. No more juggling a million apps like you’re a circus performer.

Swap Like a Pro: Need to trade some tokens? Zypto’s got built-in swaps that are smoother than your go-to playlist.

I mean, come on, who doesn’t love an app that doesn’t crash and actually does what it promises? It’s like finding a unicorn in a sea of donkeys.

**Zypto Pay: Making Crypto Payments Less Scary**

Now, if you’re a business owner (or dreaming of becoming one), Zypto Pay is gonna be your new crush. It’s their payment gateway that lets you accept crypto without needing a PhD in blockchain. Setup’s a breeze—think “faster than assembling IKEA furniture” kind of breeze.

Picture this: You’re selling handmade candles online (because your lavender ones are to die for), and someone wants to pay with Ethereum. With Zypto Pay, you don’t have to panic and Google “how to accept crypto without losing my mind.” It’s all streamlined, secure, and honestly kinda fun to watch those payments roll in.

**Crypto Cards That Feel Like Magic**

Okay, this part’s my favorite because who doesn’t love a good card? Zypto offers both virtual and physical crypto cards that you can reload with your favorite cryptocurrencies and spend anywhere. It’s like having a debit card, but cooler because you’re basically flexing your crypto skills.

Virtual Cards: Perfect for online shopping sprees. Fund it with crypto, spend in local currency—boom, done.
Physical Cards: For when you wanna swipe IRL. They’ve got high limits, so you can treat yourself to that fancy dinner without a hitch.
Reloadable Options: No need to toss ‘em after one use. Keep topping up and keep swiping.
I used one of their virtual cards to buy a new gaming mouse online, and I felt like a tech wizard. No weird conversion drama—just pure, seamless shopping bliss.

**Pay Your Bills with Crypto (Yes, Really!)**

Here’s where Zypto gets extra spicy: you can pay your bills with crypto! They support it in 10 countries right now (with more coming soon), so you can settle your credit card, utilities, or even your mortgage without touching your bank account. It’s like telling your landlord, “Here’s some Bitcoin for the rent,” and watching their jaw drop.

I haven’t tried this yet (my utility company’s still stuck in the Stone Age), but I’m itching to. There’s something so satisfying about paying for boring adult stuff with futuristic money.

**The Zypto Vault Key Card: Fort Knox for Your Crypto**

If you’re paranoid about security (like me after watching one too many hacker movies), Zypto’s got a neat trick up its sleeve: the Zypto Vault Key Card. It turns your app into a cold storage hardware wallet, keeping your assets offline until you’re ready to use ‘em. It’s like locking your crypto in a safe that only you can open—no sketchy internet stuff to worry about.

I’m not saying hackers are lurking around every corner, but having this kind of peace of mind? Priceless.

**What’s Next for Zypto? Spoiler: It’s Big**

Zypto’s not just chilling—they’re always cooking up something new. They’ve got partnerships with big names like Stellar and MoneyGram, which means you can cash in or out USDC at MoneyGram locations worldwide. No bank account? No problem! Plus, they’re rolling out services like Crypto Bill Pay in more countries (Egypt and Malaysia just joined the party).

**$ZYPTO token—Zypto’s shiny little gem!**

It’s the native token of their ecosystem, and think of it like the VIP pass to all the cool stuff Zypto offers. Holding $ZYPTO gets you some sweet perks, like revenue sharing from their payment gateway fees (yep, they spread the love), exclusive discounts on services, and access to their Rewards Hub where you can snag Zypto Points (ZYPS) to swap for virtual cards or other goodies.

It’s built on the Ethereum blockchain, so it’s got that solid foundation, and the community vibe around it is strong—Zyptonians (as they call themselves) are all about hyping it up. The token’s designed to fuel the whole “crypto payments going mainstream” mission, and honestly, it’s a fun way to feel like you’re part of something bigger while maybe saving a few bucks on fees. If you’re into it, check out their site for the deets on how to grab some.

1jbyrlo,https://i.redd.it/pnw8x59vpvoe1.jpeg,Kasol & Manali - story time,"Just got back from an epic Kasol & Manali trip—here’s how it went!

So, we started our journey from Delhi at 8 PM, took a bus from ISBT, and reached Kasol by 6:30 AM. Our hostel, goSTOPS, was across a scenic bridge near the Parvati River. On the way, a bunch of friendly mountain dogs joined us and followed us all the way to the hostel—felt like a warm welcome!

Day 1: Kasol Adventures & Hidden Villages

After freshening up, we grabbed breakfast in Kasol market and asked locals what to explore. That's when we found out about Grahan Village, a lesser-known spot requiring a 4x4 jeep ride + 40-minute trek. The jeep safari through the Kasol forest was insane—bumpy, thrilling, and surrounded by lush greenery. The trek was steep but led us to a quaint little village with insane snow-capped mountain views. We chilled there for a bit, had snacks, and then trekked back.

Later, we went to Chalal & Katagla, two riverside villages with boho cafés and peaceful trails. After walking along the Parvati River for two hours, we reached ATS Café in Katagla, which had live music and a cozy vibe. As night fell, the entire village lit up with warm lights, making it feel straight out of a dream. We took a different route back, crossed a suspension bridge, caught a bus to Kasol, and ended the day with hot chocolate and bonfire vibes at our hostel.

Day 2: Change of Plans & Manali Exploration

Originally, we planned for the Kheerganga trek, but due to heavy snowfall, all camps were removed. So, we quickly switched plans and booked a shared cab to Manali (₹500 per person). Luckily, we found a hotel on Mall Road for just ₹1,300—crazy cheap for the location!

We explored Vashisht Trek, which took us to a hidden waterfall covered in snow. The 2-hour trek was magical, walking through snow-covered forests and clicking endless pictures. At the top, we treated ourselves to Maggi & chai while soaking in the surreal view. Later, we visited the Hadimba Temple, surrounded by giant cedar trees and fresh snow, making it one of the prettiest temples I’ve ever seen. Instead of taking an auto back, we walked through Manali’s inner lanes, discovering small cafés and cute local shops before ending the night at Mall Road.

Day 3: Playing in Snow at Solang Valley

On our last day, we debated between Kullu and Solang Valley, and obviously, snow won! We booked a private cab for ₹1,500, stopped mid-way to rent snow gear, and then arrived at a complete winter wonderland. The entire valley was covered in fresh, white snow, and we decided to take a horse ride to a temple at the top instead of trekking. The view? Absolutely stunning.

After enjoying Maggi & chai (again, because it’s a mountain ritual), we made our way down, grabbed coffee, and headed to the bus lounge for our 5:45 PM ride back to Delhi.

Final Thoughts

This trip was a perfect mix of adventure, relaxation, and stunning views. From offbeat villages and hidden treks to crazy snow adventures in Solang, every moment was unforgettable. If you’re planning a Kasol-Manali trip, DO NOT skip Chalal, Grahan, or Vashisht Waterfall—they’re absolute gems.

If you have any doubts or need recommendations, feel free to DM me on Instagram (@mohit.gupta.xo)! Would love to help fellow travelers out.

I will be traveling solo at the end of March (probably to Jibhi) and looking for fellow travelers to join.
Feel free to send a request on Instagram! :)

## Addressing common Concerns

*   ​**Compatibility:** ‌The good news‌ is⁣ that most⁣ **Nespresso gift cards** are redeemable for any⁢ Nespresso product.

For example, in tech and creative industries,⁣ a ⁢readily ​available **nespresso ‍voucher** will be used ‍frequently, boosting morale and perhaps even productivity by maintaining employee caffeine levels!

After vyvanse is metabolized into dexamp. it should have the same behavior as normal dexedrine, meaning its affected by urine acidity. Some people claim that a diet coke or a coffee isnt enough to really influence the metabolism.

To my sweet Mary,

Do you remember the first time we met? It was a warm summer evening in ’69, and even now, the memory feels as vivid as a dream. You stumbled into me at the town centre supermarket, dressed in that short yellow dress that seemed to dance with the sunlight. Your blonde hair shimmered, framing a face that could halt time itself. And then, those eyes—emerald-green pools that held me captive, washing away my fleeting irritation as effortlessly as the tide.

From that moment, Mary, I was entranced. I knew, as surely as I know my own heartbeat, that you were meant to be part of my world. You must have felt it too, didn’t you? That instant connection, an unseen thread binding us together. I found myself compelled—no, drawn—to follow you, just to catch another glimpse of the life that I hoped would one day intertwine with mine.

That day changed my life forever. It was as though a dam had burst within me, releasing a flood of desires I could no longer contain. I quenched my murderous thirst, and from that moment, you became my world. Watching you was like witnessing a masterpiece in motion—every gesture, every fleeting expression, every smile. I knew, deep in my soul, that those smiles were meant for me. How could they not be?

Night after night, I sat outside your window, a silent guardian in the shadows. I stayed until dawn, sometimes longer, ensuring you drifted into sleep safely. In those quiet hours, I imagined myself beside you, my arms wrapped around your delicate frame, your warmth seeping into me. I could almost feel the softness of your skin, the intimacy of our connection, as though it were already real.

Our time together felt infinite; a secret eternity shared between us. But then, you betrayed me. How could you? You were meant to be mine and mine alone. The thought of another man touching you sets my blood ablaze, a fire I cannot extinguish.

But I digress. It began a week ago, at your bible study, when you met him. That pitiful creature with his short, red hair and infantile, yet bearded face. He barely reached your shoulder, a detail that only deepened my disgust. What could you possibly see in him? Was it his wallet, his charm, or something else entirely? The very sight of him made my stomach churn, yet you laughed with him, shared words with him, as though he were worthy of your attention.

I wanted to end him then and there, to silence his pathetic existence. But I held back, hoping you would see the truth—that he was beneath you, beneath us. I waited for you to cast him aside, to leave him in the dirt where he belongs. But you didn’t. Instead, you embraced him, welcomed him into your world.

Each time you met him, I was there, watching. Outside the restaurants, the cafés, I bore silent witness to your betrayal. I saw him bask in the warmth of your smiles, the affection that should have been mine. My heart ached with every passing day, watching this farce of a relationship unfold. And then today, you crossed the line.

I saw him enter your home, his presence an insult to everything we shared. You greeted him with a kiss, your face lighting up at the sight of the roses he brought. Roses. Of all flowers, roses. You hate them. How little he knows you—how little he deserves you.

I watched as you prepared dinner, your finest pasta with red sauce, pouring your best red wine. I watched as you changed into that elegant dress, the one that clings to you like a second skin. All that effort, wasted on this pathetic creature. My stomach churned as you dined, attempting to mimic that ridiculous scene from the cartoon with the dogs and the spaghetti. It was grotesque. It was meant to be me. Me. Not him.

And then, the unthinkable happened. You invited him to your bedroom. I saw you undress, your delicate dress pooling at your feet. For a moment, I was transfixed, caught between longing and fury. But when he began to undress, the spell broke. Reality crashed down, and I knew—I had to act.

I rushed to your door, pounding on it with a fury I could no longer contain. From inside, I heard the shuffle of footsteps, the hurried commotion of your betrayal. When the door swung open, it wasn’t you—it was him. That vermin. He said something, but the blood roaring in my ears drowned out his pathetic voice. Without hesitation, I shoved him back into the house, my hands finding his throat. I squeezed, watching his face contort, his skin turning a sickly shade of blue.

Then you appeared, my sweet Mary, your angelic voice piercing the chaos as you screamed. Even in fear, your voice was music. You ran to the kitchen, your delicate hands grasping for a weapon, while I held his life in my grip. There was no mercy left in me, only the pure, unrelenting hatred that had festered for days. I tightened my hold, feeling the cartilage crack beneath my fingers. A smile crept across my face as I spat on his twisted, gasping form.

And then, pain. A sharp, searing agony as cold steel pierced my back. I gritted my teeth, releasing the dying man as I turned my focus to you. My Mary. You tried to strike again, but my rage consumed me, fuelling a storm within. I wrenched the knife from your trembling hands and drove it into his chest, silencing his convulsions forever.

For a moment, there was peace. His lifeless body lay still, and a calm washed over me. But then you turned on me, your bare feet kicking at the wound you had inflicted. Pain shot through me, and I stumbled, losing my balance. I had hoped—foolishly—that freeing you from him would make you see me, truly see me. But your screams told me otherwise.

You fled, retreating to the kitchen, and I followed, the blade still slick with his blood. I watched as you scrambled, your trembling hands searching for anything to defend yourself. When you finally grasped a dirty spatula, I couldn’t help but laugh—a hollow, bitter sound that echoed through the room. Did you genuinely believe that would save you?

But your desperation surprised me. You charged at me, wielding that useless utensil as though it were a sword. My amusement vanished in an instant. My body moved on instinct, my fist connecting with your beautiful face. You crumpled to the floor, and for a moment, I froze. A trickle of blood ran from your nose, and something primal stirred within me.

I knelt beside you, my hands trembling as I reached out. I struck you again, and again, each blow drawing more of that crimson essence. When you stopped moving, I leaned in, tasting the coppery warmth of your blood. It was intoxicating, a forbidden nectar that consumed me, sending a wave of euphoria through my shaking body.

But then, you stirred. Before you could react, I dragged the blade across your neck, the steel slicing through your delicate skin. The blood poured out in a torrent, and your body convulsed, twitching as life ebbed away. I couldn’t stop myself—I drank deeply, as though your essence could bind us together for eternity.

And now, here I sit, cradling your cold, lifeless body. Time has lost all meaning. Hours, days—it doesn’t matter. All that matters is this moment, this perfect stillness. You are mine now, my sweet Mary. Truly mine. And no one will ever take you away from me.

Yours eternally, Jonathan Goldstein

Dianosed depression, anxiety, cPTSD, and trichotillomania 
Take 30mg escitalopram, vitamin D3, and iron supplements
I don't drink coffee or energy drinks, but normally have 1-2 cups of tea daily
Don't smoke or vape and very rarely drink


Because of my mental health, I'm used to being pretty low energy and always tired but recently, I've stopped being functional outside of work. 

For the past few months about 3-4 times a week I come home from work (~6pm), eat dinner, then fall asleep on my sofa with the lights on at like 8pm. At first I'd wake up about 2am and drag myself to bed. So I'll be sleeping about 11 hours those nights but still waking up unbelievably tired. But the past couple weeks I don't even have the energy for that now (or to even stand up to turn the lights off/go to the bathroom) and I'm just sleeping on the sofa the whole night with a pillow on my eyes like twice a week. The nights Ianage to stay awake I'm just lying on the sofa because I can't get up to so anything else.

My energy to shower has disappeared and now I'm only showering 2/3 times a week. Today I had to put a chair in my shower just to be able to. I have no energy for hobbies, cleaning, friends are anything other than lying on my sofa evening and weekends. My apartment is messy and dirty and I haven't seen multiple friends for months. I do not leave my housing community on the weekends. The most I can do on weekends is a couple loads of washing and maybe take the bins out.

However, I'm functional at work. I'm tired and yawning, sure, but I'm a functioning kindergaten teacher. I dance with the students for 30 minutes in the morning, teach an English class, have a short exercise lesson in the afternoon etc. I'm able to do my duties fine.

The second I'm not at work I honestly feel like a 500lb 90 year old. My body feels like concrete. Do I just have burnout? I like my job enough and I've only been at this job for like 6 months. My mental health is pretty stable, I'm doing fine with everything especially by my standards, so it wouldn't make sense.

Turns out, I can't even have little bit of caffeine now that I've been off of it so long. I've had dark chocolate here and there but soda, coffee, tea, or even decaf coffee intolerable. If I had a shot of espresso on empty stomach right now, it might kill me.
