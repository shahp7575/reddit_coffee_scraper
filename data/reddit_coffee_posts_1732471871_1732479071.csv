What can I do?","So about 6 years ago, in high school, me and this girl talked for a while. I’ve never connected with someone like I did with her, and our personalities seemed to match up perfectly. Unfortunately, it was senior year and we never had a chance to date before life happened and we lost touch. I never really got over it, and even though I’ve been with other people since, she’s always been on my mind. 

Fast forward to the present, and I decided to reach out to her via Snapchat since she posted a story for the first time in a while. We ended up having a great conversation, catching up with each other about life the last few years. We talked about being busy and having crazy schedules with work, and I made a bold move and asked if she wanted to get a coffee sometime and catch up. She said that sounded good and she would let me know when she got a chance. I know I should have suggested a specific day but that’s a completely different problem. 

Now, the advice I came here to ask for is, what now? If we do hang out, how do I keep my cool? I can do it over message, since I’m not looking her in the face, but I’m afraid once I actually see her again and get put on the spot I’m going to shut down and choke. I’ve overcome my fear of rejection with other women, but with her I really don’t want to screw this chance up. If it doesn’t work out it doesn’t work out, but I don’t want it to be because I made a fool of myself. Anybody have any advice?",1,1732478203.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So far so good. I didn't do the HIIT morning training I had planned though, I gotta be more committed to sleeping early so I can go back to waking up early and having productive mornings, I also have to prioritize proteins next time I go to the food pantry.

Near my office, there’s a small parking lot for a row of shops—coffee place, dry cleaner, and a tiny bakery that makes the best pastries in town. The lot has maybe 10 spots, and during peak hours, it’s a tight squeeze. Everyone who frequents these places knows the deal: park quick, grab your stuff, and don’t linger. It’s an unspoken rule, and most people respect it.

Enter Karen.

Karen drives into the lot in a brand-new white SUV—one of those massive ones that barely fit in the spaces. Instead of parking like a normal person, she pulls diagonally across two spaces. TWO. The lot was already almost full, and her selfish parking immediately caused a backup.

People in their cars started honking, but Karen stepped out of her SUV completely unbothered, holding her phone and purse like she owned the place. She didn’t even glance back at the chaos she’d caused and strolled into the coffee shop.

Now, here’s the twist: this particular lot has a kind of unofficial guardian. There’s a retired guy, let’s call him Bob, who spends his mornings sipping coffee at one of the bakery’s outdoor tables. Bob’s a local fixture—friendly, always wearing a baseball cap, and he knows everyone. Bob also has zero tolerance for nonsense, especially when it comes to parking etiquette.

Bob watched Karen park like a menace, saw the traffic jam she caused, and decided today was not the day to let it slide.

He stood up, walked over to her SUV, and pulled out a piece of paper and a Sharpie from his pocket. (Who even carries a Sharpie? Bob, apparently.) With the confidence of a man who’s been retired long enough not to care, he wrote a giant sign: “TWO SPACES? SERIOUSLY?” and taped it to her windshield.

The whole lot was watching now, some people filming on their phones. A couple of drivers clapped. Bob just sat back down at his table like he hadn’t done anything at all.

About five minutes later, Karen came out of the coffee shop, holding her iced whatever and scrolling her phone. She got to her car, saw the sign, and immediately went into full meltdown mode. Screaming, stomping her feet, looking around for who dared call her out. She ripped the sign off her windshield and started yelling into the void about how she “had an important meeting” and “couldn’t find a better spot.”

Bob, sipping his coffee like a king, casually said, “Maybe next time you’ll park like a decent human being.”

Karen turned on him, yelling about how he had no right to touch her car, threatening to call the police, blah blah blah. Bob just smiled and said, “Go ahead. I’ll wait.”

The crowd was eating this up. Someone shouted, “Maybe call a driving instructor while you’re at it!” and the lot erupted in laughter. Karen’s face turned bright red, and she stormed off, throwing her coffee into the trash and screeching her SUV out of the lot.

Here’s the cherry on top: as she sped off, she nearly hit the curb and had to reverse awkwardly while everyone just stood there, watching. Bob raised his coffee cup like a toast as she finally drove away.

Since then, Karen hasn’t been spotted in the lot, and Bob? Bob’s a local legend. Someone even printed a T-shirt with “Maybe next time you’ll park like a decent human being” on it and gave it to him. He wears it proudly every Friday.

This is my first Jura product and first superautomatic. The total cup count on the machine was only 14!  I was initially disappointed though to find coffee grounds suspended behind the glass of the LCD screen (unable to remove or clean). I started using it anyway and tried to look past that. 

However, less than 48 hours after brewing my first cup. I received a error 13 message on the screen and now have a bricked machine on my counter. Really??? From what I have gathered, this is grinder jam issue. Has anyone else experienced this? I have only brewed a few cups with whole espresso beans from the grocery store. 

This is my first Jura product and I chose to invest in it after reading how great and reliable these machines are. My confidence in their product went from 10 to 0 in just 2 days. What should my recourse be when calling customer service? Just to cut my losses and try to get a refund...and return to the coffee shop for my cups? Feels stupid buying a cappuccino after dropping thousands on this bricked machine.

1gyzjll,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1gyzjll/just_went_back_to_work_after_a_few_months_off/,just went back to work after a few months off. struggling already. sos. give me coping strategies please i beg of you,"tldr, the “unmasking” and self-discovery that i’ve gone through in the past year-ish has made me realize that the life i live is not built to accommodate me. how do i work in accommodations to help me balance work and my own mental wellbeing?

i have recently jumped back into the workforce. long story short, i was laid off from my last job and was luckily provided a decent severance that allowed me to take a few months off between work. now that i am working again, i’m realizing all the ways that i’ve been set up to fail, and am struggling to come up with ways i can make my own life easier.

i’m a teacher. preschool, specifically, so i know that it’s like…. the worst possible job for someone who is easily overstimulated, overwhelmed, etc etc but i still love it for some reason. anyway. here’s a breakdown of the things that make me want to, well, break down:

* commuting - it takes me anywhere from 35 minutes to over an hour to drive the twelve miles between my home and my work. moving is not really an option at the moment (new school is in an extremely hcol area, and my partner and i are happy where we’re at now). 
   * traffic prediction - i always end up waking up far, far earlier than i need to, due to overestimating how bad traffic will be. my goal is always to be ready by the earliest time to allow for the the maximum traffic. but, more often than not, i don’t *need* an hour to drive. so i’m just ready super early, and sit around until it’s time to go (or accidentally sit around too long and then have to rush to get in on time because traffic got worse than i’d anticipated or whatever)
   * actually driving - i hate driving with a passion. i hate sitting in traffic even more. i drive manual. it sucks, i hate it, i don’t have the money for a new car. so i sit in traffic and i get road rage because no one knows how to fucking drive. i used to cope with nicotine, but i quit at the top of the year (almost a year clean woo!) so that’s not an option anymore. music gets boring and i end up skipping through entire playlists. podcasts are sorta working for me now, but i pretty much only listen to political podcasts and that has its own issues. what do you do when you’re stuck in traffic????
   * night driving - i have bad night vision; headlights blind me severely (astigmatism yay). it’s now winter so it’s gonna be dark when i come home regardless. not really looking for a solution to this, but it adds to the scary overwhelming factor.
   * public transit is somehow more inconvenient than driving myself. yay, car-dependent society.
* food - i have a less than positive relationship with food.
   * meal planning/prepping - i suck at packing a lunch. because by the time lunch comes around, i don’t want whatever i packed. doesn’t matter what it is, but my brain won’t let me eat the stupid pbj or whatever because all the sudden that sandwich is the most nauseating thing in the world. my last job provided free food and coffee every day (spoiled i know) and it honestly i think is the only reason i ever ate, because i had options and i had it available. i didn’t have to pre-plan my meals, they took care of that for me. now that it’s my responsibility again, i can’t seem to do it and i just don’t eat at all throughout the day and that’s not sustainable
   * coffee - as i mentioned above, i had free coffee at work at my last job. that was my lifeblood, bro i survived off that. now that i’m making my own, i realize i suck at making coffee!!!! i follow 100% of the steps i saw the baristas do, i’ve read up on it extensively, but my coffee simply cannot get the same taste. my lattes suck and im so tired of it
* masking/socializing - everyone here can relate to this i’m sure. having taken months off work and really only seeing my cat, partner, family, and the few people i wanted to when i wanted to, i’m so not used to being around people all day anymore. and knowing more about myself and my audhd and all that, i feel like it’s so much harder to just….exist in environments with lots of people. not to mention the whole “new job” song and dance i have to do where i meet everyone and struggle to learn names and remember everything and…..i’m so tired man i just need rest
* having a life after work - i come home and am dead. i have to force myself into the shower before i even sit down, otherwise it won’t happen. so i get home, shower, and shut down. i don’t have the energy to partake in my hobbies and crafts and games, so i scroll and play stupid mobile games until it is time for bed. i don’t know how to motivate myself to be productive after work when work itself is so draining.

i am sort of medicated. i have about a week left of adderall, which honestly i think i need a higher dose of. i used to be on a wellbutrin sibling, but ran out of that while uninsured and can’t afford it otherwise. tapered off of it on my own (not the best but i had no choice), and honestly it went better than i expected. i had some brain fog and such, but now the only difference i’m really feeling is momentum-based. i just struggle with executive function more now, but luckily the adderall can take over once i actually get started. it’s the getting started that’s hard. (i have a doctor’s appointment next week once my new insurance kicks in, so i’ll discuss medication with my new doctor….pray for me yall lmao)

anyway. that’s not even everything but i feel like those are my biggest pains at the moment. i’m just looking for someone who can relate or has advice or anything please. because i enjoy the work i do, it just drains me so severely that i can already feel the burnout and i’ve only been working for two weeks gah",1,1732477331.0,AuDHDWomen,2,1.0,False

1gyzezo,https://i.redd.it/x3ccz1akjw2e1.jpeg,"Jeep powered my house for 100h, power box review","I have a Rubicon X 2024 with power box. I live in the PNW which was hit by a bomb cyclone last Tuesday. I’ve been using the Jeep to power the house since then and it has worked very well.

The good: 100 hours without power and was able to live comfortably as if nothing happened. The power box is able to hold all lights of the house (LED), fridge, freezer on garage, furnace (natural gas) and large appliances (microwave, coffee machine, washer and dryer (natural gas)).

I do have a transfer switch in the house. I did wire each of the 15a outlet of the power box to one of the phases of the house, through a custom made cable I did.

For the large appliances it can run only one at a time. Turn on two and it trips it which is expected. My house has all major load under Natural gas (furnace, water heater, kitchen and dryer), which helps on requiring a small generator to run the whole house, making 3600w a good size. 

We did charge the Tesla on the slow charger, added around 20% of charge. With all this, it used 3/4 of a gas tank.

What it could do better is how you configure it. If you want the engine to run, you need to keep the car on, but that drains more battery. The car could be smart enough to turn on and off by itself. The system basically has two modes:

- Blended: it keeps turning on and off the engine, but it turns the engine on for too short of a time. I think long term it could be bad, as the engine never heats up. Decided not to use because of the constant on and off
- Generator: it does run continuously, it charges the battery in a little less than 2 hours. The problem with this mode is that once the battery is charged, the engine won’t turn on again. Once the battery is depleted, the power box is off and house run out of power.

The way I did: turn on the car on generator mode, let it run for 1-2h and turn the car off. With the car off it drains from the battery only what load is using in the house. I do need to do that 2-3 times a day though which is what the car could just do automatically. A little annoying but not a big deal considering the whole picture.

Overall I think is a very solid home backup. The large car gas tank helps a lot, and running the whole night on battery without any generator noise is very pleasant as well!

1gyzen6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gyzen6/aith_for_communicating_my_own_needs_and/,AITH for communicating my own needs and boundaries with my roommate?,"I (24F) share an apartment with my roommate (26F). We are both students and have our own rooms with a lock, and we just share a common bathroom and kitchen. 

For the last couple of months there has been a lot of tension in the house. One time we had dinner together, and she suddenly got mad at me for “not cleaning the toilet right”. Mind you that everyone knows me as a clean and tidy girl, and I do my cleaning shores every week. After this, we had a lot of fight about “my cleaning habits”. Every time she gets mad when I don’t clean the exact same way as she does. She tells me she cannot understand “how I can’t see the mold” in the sink (there was none) and she can’t understand how “I can be like this”. One time I was mobbing the floor, and she came to me complaining how I’m rushing it because she “at least mobs the floor for 30 minutes” (our common area is maybe 10m2). Since then I’ve been cleaning when she’s not around so she doesn’t complain. Also we had fights about my disposable cleaning wipes. She would use mine, then throw it on the floor of the bathroom and she would text me and tell me to throw them away. When I told her she can do it herself because she used them, she told me “they’re not mine”.

Also, she uses like 75% of the space of the kitchen, and I have too little space for my stuff. I never complained to her about this. We had an empty spot on the counter because she returned her big coffee machine and I put some of my stuff there. She would keep moving it to my side of the kitchen so I would “clean it up”. I would move it back and this kept happening a couple of times. One time I was so done, I went up to her and told her that if she doesn’t like my stuff on the counter then we can divide one of her cupboards because she has way more space then I have. We tried talking all of the issues out a couple of times and I kept telling her how she can’t expect me to adapt to all her preferences and unrealistic cleaning standards. 

During the summer, my boyfriend and I had an fulltime internship in the same city. It was nearer to my place, and pretty far from his place. I thought we could stay at my place during the summer, because during the day we would be both working from the firm, and we would just come home in the evening eating dinner and sleeping early. My roommate got mad and we agreed that he would just stay a maximum of 3 nights and he could stay 4 if it was going ok. I understood that she didn’t like it, and I told there that if there is anything bothering her during his stay of 3 nights, she could tell me. I’ve also never let my boyfriend stay 4 nights because I didn’t want to create more tension. I thought we talked it out and weeks went by, and suddenly one day she came angry to my door telling my and my boyfriend “how disrespectful we are for never asking her if there is anything bothering her”. I was surprised because I can’t read her mind and I told her that if there was anything wrong, she could discuss it with like we sgreed. When college started again, she got mad and told me how disrespectful I was for not letting her know my boyfriend’s internship has ended? This was weird to me because I’ve told her before for how long he was staying and when our internships ended I talked to her about my boyfriend’s experience with the firm and his vacation abroad. 

Anyway, college had started for a couple of months now, and my boyfriend usually spends 1, 2 or max 3 nights a week in my room. It differs each week, and sometimes he doesn’t come at all the whole week. He usually comes in the evening and goes to his class in the morning. During the exam week, he happened to stay 4 nights because my uni is literally 10 minutes from my place (and 1,5h from his) and he had three exams in the morning that week. The week after I had dinner with my roommate and I apologized for his presence for that week and explained to her it was because of his exams and that it was kind of unplanned. She got mad at me again. I told her that I want to decide myself who and when someone is coming over at my room, as long as they don’t hinder her. I also told her that I want to take her wishes into account and that he will only be in my room for a maximum nights if 2/3 days a week (most of the weeks he is here only 1 or 2 nights). I asked her if there was anything else, and she told me no. 

I thought it was all ok, but when I returned home the next week she would always close her door, ignore me and she would leave the house as soon as I came back from class.

My boyfriend and I went to a concert of one of our friends on Thursday evening, and we came back at 12:30 AM, we just ate something from
The fridge and went back to sleep. I never go out and this was the first time in 11 months (since I live here) that I came home “this late”. The next morning she comes up to me and asks me if we can be more quiet next time because we woke her up. I told her we will pay extra attention next time, and I asked her if she also could pay attention to not slamming the kitchen drawers too hard in the morning because my bed is next to the kitchen and that has also woken me up every day for the last couple of months. I told her I didn’t mean this in a wrong way, but it would be nice if we both pay attention to the noises we make. She got mad at me and told me how “hypocritical” I was for just telling her now and that “she can never say something to me without me talking back”. 

Am I the asshole for also communicating my wishes? Because I feel like for the last couple of months I’ve been always taking into account her feelings and not mine. I plan my whole schedule around hers because she wants to use the bathroom in the morning, she never asks about my schedule. I make sure to never use the electric toothbrush in the evening to shower after 12AM. She always uses the electric toothbrush and shower in the morning when I’m still sleeping. I never said something about her noises in the kitchen because I thought since we don’t live solo and have different schedules, we have to tolerate some (normal) things from each other. She told me she doesn’t like it when my door is closed, so I made sure I always keep my door open (even when I’m studying and distracted by her) meanwhile she is the one that closes her door more than I do. 

I’m so done with the whole situation, she is always mad at me and I can’t ever do something right according to her. ",2,1732476987.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

I am a pretty avid gamer nowadays after a couple year hiatus.

I have a very well equiped PC in my bedroom, which has a dual monitor and connects to a 45"" TV in front of my bed as well.

In my living room I have a 65"" OLED TV with a Playstation 5 attached to it.

I am pretty satisfied, but I will say that I am kind of disappointed in the PS5 game library, and I want to use my crown piece TV for gaming too.

I am allocating some budget to build another top of the line PC for my living room. However, I don't want a keyboard, mouse, and controller just hanging out on my coffee table just to boot up games and then play them.

I would like this PC to have an OS that is completely controlled with a controller, that will boot up games from a game library on the ""home screen"", but also give me PC-like ability to run a game library (qbittorrent, wink).

Does anyone have any experience setting up something like this?

Sex M

Height 5'8""

Weight 190

Race W

Duration of complaint entire life.

So to start, I'll say everything doctors have tried, or been told to try from people on the internet.

Famotodine
Zyrtec
Antacid
Omeperozol
Inhalers
Quitting caffeine
Nasal Saline
Benadryl
Breathe right strips
""Not thinking about it""
Hurting myself slightly (like pinching skin, or biting inside of cheek) yeah idk.
Vitamin D
Iron
Steroids for a possible infection
Antibiotics.

When I tell you that the throat clearing is constant, I mean literally from when I wake up, to an hour after lying down. 

Background information:

I've always had cats, and dogs. I have both now. I've never gotten an allergy test as I've never had the money.

I'm a carpenter, and the sawdust DOES seem to make it worse, but that doesn't explain my childhood.

I have ADHD and am medicated for it, but I wasn't as a child.

I do not drink coffee, energy drinks, or tea.

I do not smoke nor vape

I live in Minnesota

Symptoms: 

near constant feeling of post nasal drip.

Back of throat itch/tickle

Feeling of a ""rising severity of irritation"" if I try to not think about it, or consciously try not to cough.

A feeling of needing cough drops/gum/mints at all times. It does help.

Tonsil stones. Possibly unrelated.

What I'm taking now:
Vitamin D 2,000 mg
Amphetamine Salt combo 20mg (adderall) twice daily (for about a year)
Physillium husk (for about a month)
Zyrtec
Pepcid AC maximum strength
Fluticasone propionate spray
Multivitamin with iron
saline spray.

I live in Canada, specifically Ontario and I’m currently looking to buy a espresso maker for a family Christmas gift

I’ve currently only really looked at the Breville bambino and small Casabrews because both of them are relatively inexpensive

We have never owned espresso makers, and I’m not too concerned about coffee because my parents are more knowledgable when it comes to the beans 

The all in ones are a bit expensive for my taste 

So I would like something smaller that would be inexpensive but decent

And I would also like some advice on a cheap burr grinder, and just some accessories that I could buy that aren’t just complete garbage

I preferred vessel for espresso is usually cappuccinos, but I have been tending to drink more Americanos

And I’ve been drinking Americano’s about once a week, which I’ll usually just grabbed from a Balzac’s café near my campus 

A big reason I’m looking at an espresso machine because I can’t pay five bucks for a coffee every week. It’s absurd. But I prefer espresso because unlike the Tim Hortons drip, they don’t piss off my stomach.

A big thing for me is it not being too large so it doesn’t take all the counter space I have but I’m fine with having multiple machines for the Burr grinder and what not

Again, I am completely brand new and YouTube hasn’t been much help too much sponsored content

So really the only two things I’ve been looking at are the small Casabrews and the Breville Bambino but you’re both around $100-$200 Canadian at the moment

If anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated.

Patronizing small and independent business helps sustain direct and secondary jobs, tax revenue for local governments and creating vibrant cities.  
  
For every 100 direct jobs in local retail, the money spent creates, or supports, 48 secondary jobs. Conversely, shopping at a national chain creates just 14 secondary jobs.  
  
California has 68,478 retail employers and 357,684 sole proprietors. Also, $68 out of every $100 spent at local stores remains in the local economy.

For years, I unconsciously partially close it when breathing so that the air that passes through makes a loud noise in my throat (think about making that whispered, throaty, ''ahhhhh"" sound when you take that first sip of coffee, or first sit inside a hot tub). I even fully-close it at times and just stop breathing - especially when I'm concentrating on something.


I also do this in my sleep - and the sound my breathing makes is rather loud, according to the better half. It's not quite snoring. it's not quite apnea (or is it)?

I never knew her age) at a party. I was really drunk and we made out at that party. 2 months later we see each other at a 3 day party and I realized she is really not my type and had some other red flags. The first night of the party I didn't drink because I had to take care of some friends who had too much. She approached me and made small talk with me while I was dealing with my friends to which I responded cold because I wasn't really interested in her and she gave me weird vibes. 



The next day is a really big party at which I get black out drunk while partying with my friends. I then get out of my black out while walking back to my place and I see she's next to me. I ask her what we were talking about and apparently it was past traumas. I wake up again at my place where my roommate threw an after party and I'm talking to a friend and at that point I'm so drunk I fall over and hit my head on my coffee table and bleed a bit. After that I gain consciousness again and I'm in my room naked and she's on top of me having sex. I black out around 10 seconds later not really taking in what's happening. The next day I wake up still really drunk and don't remember much from that morning. In the afternoon I start getting my head back together and then realize she stole my wallet. I get a text from my friends that she's at the party with them for the last night and she can give me my wallet. I go and collect it and like the other days she is talking to me even though I'm trying to avoid her.the next couple days, I start to feel worse and worse about the situation since I really didn't find her attractive and after thinking about it I felt taken advantage of.



Throughout the year I find out more and more things about the party like we were kissing at the place the main event was happening and that she had a boyfriend. My friends who were also at the party and who she started talking to found her really weird and untrustworthy because of things the girl told them.

  
  
Recently there was the same party and I saw her at it. I decided to go and tell her how I felt really uncomfortable about what happened last year and asked her what happened. She tells me I was definitely conscious and she seemed a bit defensive. I took it as her being defensive because of what she did.



The next day she sends me a text telling me what happened for her. Apparently, I was really onto her since the beginning of the party (I know from what my friends told me when they were around that that's not the case) and then tells me how we started kissing at the party and that I really wanted her to come to my place and that once we were at my place I was the one who made all the moves. She told me that when everyone left we went to my room and I was taking things fast and that she told me to slow down multiple times. After that while we were making too much noise and that it made her uncomfortable we stopped. I then asked her if she came and she said yes to go to sleep. After that I apparently was still kissing her and wanting hugs. Told me at the end that she understands what happened was really scary for me but that from her side she also felt dirty after.



Since then I really don't know how to feel because I was completely unable to give consent in that situation, I was severely intoxicated to the point I don't remember most of the night and feel taken advantage of, but on the other hand, in my drunk state I made her feel gross after sex and was the one who apparently initiated things.

TL;DR : At a party a girl I really didn't like had sex with me while I was black out drunk. This year I see her and tell her about it. She tells me that I made her feel gross after having sex with me.",3,1732476422.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

Since then, my body's reaction to coffee is extreme. For some time I would feel my heart beat throughout my body when standing. Heart racing when I turned over in my sleep. My heart skipped beats for a month straight. Likely my stomach's inflammation pressing on vagus nerve. Coffee would make all of this worse, and cause me to be completely weak.

I had 2 coffees this morning and felt drugged. Not in a good way. Dizzy and completely out of it. Unable to follow or carry a conversation, slurred speech. Feel like I'm poisoned from some chemical.

I've tried to stop over the last twelve months. I go a week or so and cave. The longest I've made it is 5 weeks. But I have to stop now for good. There's nothing redeemable about it, though my mind tricks me into forgetting how terrible my body's reaction is to it, and I go back.

I then attempted a few other roles in the field.  Some paid much less than I was paid even before graduate school.  Others did not have the health care benefits I needed or were contract positions.  Three times I attempted substance abuse specialist roles, and none of those were a good fit for me either.  My last job was in disaster case management (non masters level), and I did perform much better in that role, but it was still not without continued challenges and it was not a long-term role.

But I have learned so much about myself through the years:

1. I am particularly brave enough to share my personal experiences, and I can articulate very well in writing, though prone to typos (that require extra proofreading and review). I attempted to proof check this, but I do apologize if I missed anything.  
2. I mostly like to write about personal stories.  Whether I am the subject, or others. It does not have to be all about me.  But not to “justify” like some kind of lawyer why a person needs assistance.  It’s not that I am against the need to do that or have not done that, I just do not like being in that role, as the “middle man” because it’s way harder than you think. Yes, that probably a run on sentence.  It stays.
3. I am having great difficulty applying for disability for three reasons.  (A) providing all the information is tedious (aka overwhelming due to the number of jobs and had and number of medical providers I have seen) (B) because I have a masters degree, I have to try that much harder to provide proof at a “young” 45 years of age (C) I know I still have some unique gifts that I could prove useful under the right conditions.  

I do have special needs, though. 

Examples Below: 
1. I can no longer walk back and forth comfortably and handle standing for even a minute without pain.  Therefore, just getting up to “make a copy” “grab a cup of coffee” or use the restroom facilities at home or at work, takes more effort and regular pain experiences than most could understand.
2. Working a set 40 hours each week on a set schedule, is nearly impossible.  I need the ability to take off for all medical needs or work from home as needed.  I actually do prefer working from an accessible office as opposed to work from home position, but sometimes my health conditions require a little more flexibility.

My last job as a disaster case manager taught me much about resource referral and navigating the funding and application processes of those programs.  It also taught be I do have some challenges with certain processes I feel require too many hoops to jump through just to “maybe” be accepted and often not.

I have some really strong feelings about my experience as a person with disabilities attempting the navigate these government or nonprofit programs myself, as well as, my professional experience of seeing things on the other side. 
 
I don’t know too many people like myself, with this unique perspective.  I was a top student in my educational studies (grade-wise speaking), and am now, finding myself, kind of shoved off, and in the background.  I do not believe I am solitary in this experience, but I have noticed “certain voices” are not being heard.  They are not even invited to table. 

I know I am not suitable for most roles within the field, but I still think I deserve a voice at the table.  My voice should be heard.  Not because I’m “so special” but because I am the voice of many, who just don’t have the ability to share their stories because they have not been invited to the table either and have found some other way to live their life.

If you know of any “place” for me, please let me know.

I also, have the misfortune, of not being in an ideal romantic relationship.  It has given me the  additional experience of being a person with a disability navigating family challenges, as well as, domestic violence resources.  I did end up back with my partner and choose to stay with him for reasons that would make many “professionals” “advocates” and “feminists” feel uncomfortable. 

But it’s part of my story, so that’s why I am venting and sharing here.

Hey guys, I have a bit of a dilemma that’s been stuck in my head. Some context of who I am, I am currently in college with a loving and supportive partner! For the past 1.5 years I’ve been discovering that I might be trans(MtF)/queer in some way (still have lots to learn). Figured I’d put this in this subreddit since there’s a few experiences I’ve had that I think are somewhat relatable to other MtF peeps.

Recently (4ish months ago) I moved to middle of nowhere, Ohio for an internship. I’m a very extroverted person, whenever I’m somewhere new I try to meet people and make friends, and at first I made friends with the other interns pretty easily. 

Long story short, the first intern friend group I made (all boys) quietly shut me out from things and I still don’t really know why. I have this gut feeling it’s because they think I’m weird because I act a little feminine, one particular instance happened when we were all drunk and someone made a joke about how i present myself when talking (i move around my hands femininely, paint my nails, put my hands of my hip, and do other small micro movements). People laughed at his joke and said more stuff about my micro-movements which is something I can’t really help a lot of the time unless if I hyper focus my movements (which i don’t like doing), and they only get a little more dramatic when I’m drunk. I started not getting invited to things and slowly but surely not being included in anything at all. Maybe I just wasn’t likeable, but I have this gut feeling that me acting feminine (and also my transition) has at least something to do with it.

I did make a second friend group (again all boys, big company, over 200 interns, I said yes to someone looking to start a trivia night team and we’ve hung out ever since) but with them I feel like I’m not myself a lot of the time. I’ve also started noticing traits of toxic masculinity in some of the jokes this friend group makes, many of their jokes put down other people which I mean can be a joke but based on the tone and language used there’s probably some subtle unconscious maliciousness behind them. This time the jokes aren’t being targeted at me, which I mean I’m grateful but it still makes me feel like I’m in Survival Mode when I just want friends.

After that, I decided to get Bumble for Friends to look for queer friends in the area. Mainly because one, I usually find myself able to comfortably act like myself with queer people, and two, I feel like I have no one to talk to about my feelings regarding my transition. I also have queer friends back in college and I can really feel like myself with them, where with cis groups I feel like I have to keep watch on how I act, or else stuff like what happened with the first intern group happens, or I would eventually become the butt of the joke in the second group. 

Anyways, I FOUND SOMEONE! They’re awesome, they also have a happy and loving partner, we like the same music and have similar hobbies, all around great person. Some context (which is unfortunately important), this friend is trans and goes by they/he pronouns, and has a girl partner. I am feeling some feelings of guilt though involving my partner, my family, and this new friend I made (I’ll just go in order to kind of organize my thoughts).

So the guilt with my partner.. me and this friend have been hanging out for a bit! There is NO romantic/sexual feelings between us, or at the very least from me. And I highly doubt they have those feelings as well, they are taken, have made no moves and 100% respects my current relationship (and even wants to meet my partner! i met theirs before too). My partner is also fully aware of this friend, and that I hang out with them, they also have no problem with me hanging out with them. The guilt comes from internal thoughts, one problem I have is that we (me and the friend) hang out and watch movies at night. Most recently we got high and stayed up late to watch a movie and I left at around 12am. Some tiny part of me feels like I’m betraying my partner for hanging out with my friend. I also think it partly has to do with my family (more on that later). Anyways, this narrative (I guess taken from a cis perspective) of two people of different genders alone in an apartment watching a movie, getting high, and one finally leaving at 12am is just begging for people to think something weird is happening. I 100% know in the back of my mind that nothing is wrong, I’m not cheating and the friend isn’t breaking any boundaries, but this feeling of guilt is still here and it really makes me think “I shouldn’t be doing this” when all I’m doing is just chilling with a friend (it gets really bad when i’m high and think the worst of every situation). Is that feeling of guilt valid? Is there really something sinister about this? Should I really not be doing this or is this just years of heteronormativity being baked in my brain to the point where if I have a friendship that, through the lens of that heteronormativity, implies cheating then I should just end it? Basically, I feel like the only person telling me that this friendship is okay is myself. I gave you guys my perspective of it, I just need to know if I’m right or wrong… 

Next up my family (which ties into what I just talked about). Most of my closest friends are girls, which has usually been the case my whole life, but neither my mom or my dad know (they’re divorced so I talk to them separately and they don’t keep in touch). Back to that heteronormativity thing, I feel like with them I have to hide my friendships or they’ll think i’m always cheating on my partner or think i’m a whore or something. One time my Mom even went on a rant about how people shouldn’t be friends with the opposite gender at all because it’s disrespectful to your spouse, and as she was talking about this i just thought in the back of my mind like “omg i cannot tell her who my friends are”. And my Dad ALWAYS says something whenever I tell him i’m gonna hang out with a girl alone. He’s done this forever and it really makes me feel guilty when I hang out with my friends that are girls even though I know nothing bad is happening. One time when I was home for break (me and my partner were together at this time) I went to get coffee with a friend and he said “don’t worry i won’t say anything but just be careful with your secrets, they’ll all eventually come out” or something along those lines which just straight up implies cheating. for so many years i’ve tried to tell him they’re just friends but i eventually just hid the genders of my friends to them. the craziest part is my partner knows. it feels like the only people i have to actually keep secrets from are my parents or else they’ll think i’m cheating. although, some small part of me feels like they’re right and it makes me feel like i can’t have queer/woman friends. again, same problem as before, the only person telling myself it’s okay to have these kinds of friendships are myself and i feel like i need either some assurance that it’s okay or some other nonbiased perspective saying it’s not okay.

TLDR: I temporarily moved away from home for an internship. Felt a little lonely and wanted to make a queer friend, used a friend matching app (BFF) and met someone. We are purely friends, no boundaries are crossed (they are AWESOME). Some context, I have a loving partner and a not-so-queer-friendly family. I also feel like I am trans. I feel super guilty for doing this for lots of reasons (see above), basically I feel like I’m the only one who says it’s okay, and I feel like I have to hide this friendship from my family (not my partner).

1gyywvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1gyywvd/5_yeast_kilju/,5 yeast Kilju,"I mixed about 4 gal of water with ~4.5 quarts of sugar and added one of each variety of yeast from a Red Star sample pack. A week later I added yeast nutrient (shipping delay) and the brew is coming up on 2 weeks, still slowly bubbling away.

I'm planning to make an Earl Gray syrup to backsweeten and flavor the wine, probably by the glass to avoid secondary fermentation. I have some Monin glass syrup bottles salvaged from a coffee shop and pumps from Amazon for the job.

I'm not sure if I'm going to need to let it age for flavor, but I am curious about distilling it. I've considered a countertop water distiller to do about a gallon at a time, but how much methanol will I need to purge, and will the distiller heat up too fast since it's meant for distilling water? Might not be worth the time, money, and effort.

I've also considered cold jacking. My freezer isn't big enough,  but the weather here is cold enough that I could leave the jug in my car to freeze. By my calculations i should be pushing 20% alchohol if the yeast doesn't stall (we'll see if it goes fully dry, right!) So I'm expecting about a gallon of hooch from this method.

My goal is to make it as drinkable as possible, so I'm wondering if there's any way to remove any methanol in the brew without distilling, or if there's really any benefit. Reduced hangover would be a huge boon!

Thoughts/questions welcome!

Tentatively, I think the best option is cold jack, then slowly heat on the stove until temp reaches ~70C to be sure the methanol is gone. Also, I'm at about 5,000ft elevation, not sure that makes much difference, but water boils at 200F here.",4,1732475744.0,Homebrewing,1,1.0,False

","hello. i would like to rant about my annoying upstairs neighbor and let me know what you would do in my situation. let me know if i am overreacting, lol. this might be lengthy.

my fiance and i moved into our apartment in June. we absolutely love it here and our cats are so happy. however, our upstairs neighbor is literally so annoying and disgusting. within a month of moving in, i realized that his balcony that is right above my little patio/balcony area, he keeps trash and alcohol bottles, cans, ashtray etc, on his balcony. i didn't think anything of it, as long as it doesn't affect me. but there were a few windy days and cigarette butts and a beer can fell onto my area. i honestly didn't really care, i picked it up and threw it all away because we haven't gotten a patio set or done much with the area yet. then a month later, another beer can, more cig butts. i started to get a little frustrated because i just wish he had the normal awareness or consideration of thinking things could blow around etc idk, don't keep trash in a shared area that could blow everywhere, i think it's not hard to have that simple awareness but i could be wrong. anyways, so i don't see him much and when i do it's when i'm leaving or something, and i didn't want to write a note, so i just called the front office and let them know that his trash keeps falling into our area and if it was okay if they just gave him a heads up about it. i did this because usually they write letters or notes to everyone's apartment if they have trash in their balcony or garage area so i thought they'd keep it general. but they wrote it as if someone complained and he writes a note on the letter and sticks it on my door and says it's not his beer cans or trash and none of it has ever fallen on my area (i have pictures to prove it its his trash and it has) so he's just a liar and childish. i get being annoyed that someone complained about you but the letter was so passive aggressive and we legit know it's his trash so it's just like ok whatever bro. we ignore the letter and we're just happy he's aware it's happening. he took care of it all, so in the end it was over.

  
a month later, i noticed he has his little like bathroom type garbage bin on his balcony, and it is filled to the top with plastic bags that are tied and it's overflowing, and there's bags tied surrounding it too. then i look more closely and it's LITERAL DOG SHIT IN BAGS. he has a dog and i guess he doesn't want to walk to the garbage bin in the parking lot to drop his dogs shit off, so he just drops it into that bin and waits for it to fill up then he goes and throws it out. 

tell me if i am overreacting, but i am literally so disgusted because it is right above my patio. those bags of shit will be so smelly in the summer if he keeps this up and can easily fall into my area. it's cold now so it's not like there's a ton of bugs or the temperature is more likely to make it smell, but i am afraid to use my area and sit, drink my coffee or read my kindle in the mornings because what if a bag of dog shit falls on my head or on my table? it's legit 20-30 plastic bags of dog shit tied up just overflowing sitting on his balcony and it's so close to my area i can't stand it. so, i made another polite call to the office and sent them photos of the bags of dog shit and they were shocked. they said they're going to write him a letter but i pleaded them to keep it general as if they saw it, because this guy is literally so disgusting and weird (he's always screaming profanity and being so loud, stomping, he is fucking crazy and unbearable to live around) so i'm afraid he'll retaliate or think we're focusing on him. i'm really not trying to be aware of what he's doing but it's absolutely insane and i am not going to wait for a bag of dog shit to fall onto my area to say something. 

even last night, him and his girlfriend were getting into a really bad fight, we could hear EVERYTHING. her screaming/crying, him yelling, throwing objects, and the other day he overflowed his bathtub and it leaked into our bathroom. i'm so sick of him. 

i am going to call and get an update because the bin with shit is still there, he emptied it out the day after i called but it's filling up again. i literally refuse to live under this disgusting person's dog shit bags. i want to use my area without the risk of a bag of shit blowing onto my stuff. isn't it a hazard??? thanks for listening to my rant ",2,1732475482.0,neighborsfromhell,8,0.75,False

Most recently we got high and stayed up late to watch a movie and I left at around 12am. Some tiny part of me feels like I’m betraying my partner for hanging out with my friend. I also think it partly has to do with my family (more on that later). Anyways, this narrative (I guess taken from a cis perspective) of two people of different genders alone in an apartment watching a movie, getting high, and one finally leaving at 12am is just begging for people to think something weird is happening. I 100% know in the back of my mind that nothing is wrong, I’m not cheating and the friend isn’t breaking any boundaries, but this feeling of guilt is still here and it really makes me think “I shouldn’t be doing this” when all I’m doing is just chilling with a friend (it gets really bad when i’m high and think the worst of every situation). Is that feeling of guilt valid? Is there really something sinister about this? Should I really not be doing this or is this just years of heteronormativity being baked in my brain to the point where if I have a friendship that, through the lens of that heteronormativity, implies cheating then I should just end it? Basically, I feel like the only person telling me that this friendship is okay is myself. I gave you guys my perspective of it, I just need to know if I’m right or wrong… 

Next up my family (which ties into what I just talked about). Most of my closest friends are girls, which has usually been the case my whole life, but neither my mom or my dad know (they’re divorced so I talk to them separately and they don’t keep in touch). Back to that heteronormativity thing, I feel like with them I have to hide my friendships or they’ll think i’m always cheating on my partner or think i’m a whore or something. One time my Mom even went on a rant about how people shouldn’t be friends with the opposite gender at all because it’s disrespectful to your spouse, and as she was talking about this i just thought in the back of my mind like “omg i cannot tell her who my friends are”. And my Dad ALWAYS says something whenever I tell him i’m gonna hang out with a girl alone. He’s done this forever and it really makes me feel guilty when I hang out with my friends that are girls even though I know nothing bad is happening. One time when I was home for break (me and my partner were together at this time) I went to get coffee with a friend and he said “don’t worry i won’t say anything but just be careful with your secrets, they’ll all eventually come out” or something along those lines which just straight up implies cheating. for so many years i’ve tried to tell him they’re just friends but i eventually just hid the genders of my friends to them. the craziest part is my partner knows. it feels like the only people i have to actually keep secrets from are my parents or else they’ll think i’m cheating. although, some small part of me feels like they’re right and it makes me feel like i can’t have queer/woman friends. again, same problem as before, the only person telling myself it’s okay to have these kinds of friendships are myself and i feel like i need either some assurance that it’s okay or some other nonbiased perspective saying it’s not okay.

TLDR: I temporarily moved away from home for an internship. Felt a little lonely and wanted to make a queer friend, used a friend matching app (BFF) and met someone. We are purely friends, no boundaries are crossed (they are AWESOME). Some context, I have a loving partner and a not-so-queer-friendly family. I also feel like I am trans. I feel super guilty for doing this for lots of reasons (see above), basically I feel like I’m the only one who says it’s okay, and I feel like I have to hide this friendship from my family (not my partner). Am i wronging my partner, family, or even this friend?",2,1732475204.0,AskLGBT,2,1.0,False

Well, not exactly, but I do enjoy being someone you can share your thoughts with. I'm the kind of person who likes deep dives into random topics, whether it's your favorite books, weird conspiracy theories, or just how your day went.

A bit about me: I'm always up for learning about things I'm not familiar with. I also have a soft spot for quiet evenings with a good cup of tea or coffee.

I’m looking for a pal who’s open to chatting about anything under the sun—life stories, silly jokes, random existential thoughts, or just venting about the little annoyances of life. No pressure, just a safe space to connect.

I never had the opportunity to tell you about my bird ring or how that trip is now a memory of you. It always comes back to you.

My skits, and Scenes? are not canon. they're here for fun, and laughs. Probably some crying, but we're gettin' to that in a sec. And without further delay,  \*spins a coin on the table\* Let's see where we land. \*plays\*

**Topside,  Enforcer Station 12:00 PM.**

*Caitlyn adjusts her patch focusing on the papers in front of her. She finished filling out a form, and placed it on the main pile after signing it. A month had passed since the Noxian assault on Piltover, things were quiet, and peaceful. Vi learned a fair deal on how things around the office worked. She, and Caitlyn were happy together. Even Tobias Kiramman, Caitlyn's father admitted his faults, and proudly accepted Vi into the family. Caitlyn over this time invested city resources into rebuilding Councilor Kiramman's air purification project. The newly appointed Chairmen of Zaun, and the firelight's leader oversaw the construction. The station's Front desk secretary was hard at work trying to finish her papers before break. She wiped her brow.*

Roseline Hope: Just... one... more.. and.. done!  \*stacks it up\* Phew. It's hard getting all that stuff done before lunch huh mossy?

*The green shelled snail that was chewing on some lettuce looked at her\**

Roseline: Sometimes i get the feeling you don't listen too well.

*She smiled, lightly tapping the glass to the enclosure once*

*something landed from the rafters above onto her desk, a live grenade, crudely drawn on depicting a shark's maw, Roseline stood up shocked, and backed away from it, then a blue drop hit her on the wrist, she looked up, and scanned the ceiling, but found nothing. seconds later, the grenade expanded, and nearly gave Roseline panic attack. She braced for the impact, but nothing happened, so carefully turning it around she found a small note saying,* ***""mIsS mE?""*** *Roseline looked up at the ceiling again, and spoke.*

Roseline: Jinx?

*her voice was met with in the darkest corner with two piercing purple eyes, and a barely visible smile that said*

Jinx: Hey Rosebush...

*Roseline smiled, and Jinx landed on the desk neck first.*

Jinx:  EH, Work in progress...

Roseline: JINX i thought you d-

Jinx: AH, ah ah... Explosive Vacation. NOW i gotta... check IN on some people... 

*Jinx clambered near Roseline, holding her collar.*

Jinx: If you blow my cover you'll be part of my new ""Art, project"" Got it?

Roseline: Promise

Jinx; Good... and for my first trick...!!!

*Jinx removes part of the wall, and goes inside closing it up Roseline clapped*

Roseline: OH that's how she kept getting in there. wow.

*Jinx hid inside the walls of the station, creeping along the inner spaces.* she noticed Vi trying to get the copier to work. Vi began to shout at it.

Vi: I swear to god, if i didn't wanna piss off Cait' I'd put the mitt on, and smash this piece of scrap.

*Vi fiddled with the plug, and put it back in, and the machine worked like new. she pointed at the copier*

Vi: You got lucky.

*Jinx peering through a sight hole strained to hold in a laugh, and kept moving on. She ended up at the Sheriff's office area. Jinx knew because she could hear the faint, and quiet classical music coming from her office.*

Caitlyn: Honestly there's more property theft in the southern district than north.

*Jinx made her move, and zipped up to the rafters after leaving the inner walls. Caitlyn with a hand on her cup began to look around.*

Caitlyn: Vi? are you in here?

Jinx: So... this is where the ""commander"" sits huh...?

*Caitlyn spits her coffee out loudly*

*Caitlyn:* No...

Jinx: I'm the ghost of kicking your ass...

Caitlyn: I can't believe this...

*Caitlyn shone a scope light at the rafters, and dimly lit was a pale, and lanky figure crouched on a rafter beam*

Jinx: OK, i don't need the spotlight stage manager... turn it off.

Caitlyn: I had a feeling y-

Jinx: YEAH , yeah yeah, the vent shaft, the airship blah blah blah... 

*jinx landed on the ground. Caitlyn's single eye widened, and began to approach her. Jinx kept her guard up, and eyes fixated on Caitlyn.*

Jinx: y'know? Somethin's different about you. Can't quite put my finger on it...!  

*jinx tipped her fingers across Caitlyn's eyepatch, and to her head.*

Jinx: New haircut?

*Caitlyn blankly pointed to her eyepatch.*

Jinx: OH yeah that's it...!

Caitlyn: Where, did you go?

Jinx: Where'd i go...? I went across the world... met some fun people...! MAY have broken a few things... SO, did ya... y'know?

*Caitlyn said with a sigh.*

Caitlyn: Yes jinx.

*J*inx: GOOD for her...! Hey... I FEEL like makin' a little game So... how's about you, and the paper princess up front play along...

Caitlyn: I would prefer you kept Miss hope out of your little ""game""

Jinx: IT's for Vi relax... jeez still tighter than an eel around a fish...

Caitlyn: Fine. but if i see ONE article of rope i swear to g-

Jinx: GREAT now go make Vi do the boring shit, and bring your desk girl back here...! I'll be waitin"" in the closet...!

Jinx went into the closet.

Caitlyn stood up, and went to where Vi was. 

*Vi was flinging a few rubber bands at the wall, she then looked at Caitlyn.*

Vi: i wasn't not working?

Caitlyn: Right... Vi, please follow me.

Vi: Lead the way Captain.

*Vi followed Caitlyn to the front desk, Roseline looked over, and saluted her Sheriff.*

Roseline: Hi Vi, Miss Kiramman.

Vi: Hey rosie.

Caitlyn: Miss Hope please follow me back to my office it's important. Vi, can we trust you to handle the front desk for ten minutes?

Vi: Probably.

Caitlyn: Good enough. Come along miss hope.

*Roseline followed Caitlyn to the back. Vi sat there at the front desk looking at everything.*

Vi: Jeez, she does this shit everyday?

*Caitlyn went inside with roseline, and both sat down in some chairs.*

*Jinx walked out of the storage room wearing an enforcer helmet, and uniform.*

Roseline: WOW jinx it's like you wore one of those before or something.

Jinx: JUST keep your yapper shut, and follow the plan...!

Caitlyn, Roseline, and jinx discussed the plan Caitlyn covered her eye in an annoyed way several times, but still nodded. 

jinx: OK, so... you get Vi in here, tell Rose bush here, the ""news"" and it'll all woooooork out...!

Roseline: I'm scared she'll hurt you.

Caitlyn: Miss Hope, Trust me when i say, that Jinx, and Hurt on a physical standpoint cancels each other out.

Roseline: Yes Ma'am.

Jinx: OK one eyed wonder go get er...!

Caitlyn: Call me that again and you'll be sure to match.

Jinx: Jeez touchy...

*Caitlyn walked out to the front.*

*Vi squints her eyes trying to make sense of something she read.*

Vi: The hell did we go to an ice Cream factory...?

Caitlyn: Vi. come to my office.

Vi: I'm not doin' anything!

Caitlyn: This is very important it's about Miss Hope.

Vi: Shit.

Vi got up, and followed Caitlyn back, she went inside, and noticed an armed enforcer next to Roseline, and she looked very scared.

Caitlyn: Now, Roseline Hope you are being charged by several parties do to inaccurate paperwork.

Roseline: I don't feel too good Sheriff.

Vi: Hey, Rose it's alright. nothing a little community service can't fix yeah?

Caitlyn: Vi... she's being taken to Stillwater, because these are serious allegations.

Vi: What? you're gunna send er' to the slammer for the botched paperwork?!

Caitlyn: the sentence is one year. one added for each payment failed.

Vi: Cait, this is ASS!

Caitlyn: I'm not thrilled about it either!

Roseline: Vi... will you and Miss Kiramman visit me, and take care of mossy?

*she teared up.*

*Vi went over to Roseline, and grabbed her shoulder.*

Vi: Every day.

Caitlyn: Of course.

*jinx used the rifle to butt Roseline in the side.*

*Vi glared at the enforcer.*

Vi: HEY asshole, what the hell your problem?!

Caitlyn: Sir, please no violence in my office.

*Jinx: Butts roseline in the rear.*

Roseline: i'm not DOING anything! HEY!

Vi: ALRIGHT I've had it with this guy.

*Vi full on tackles the enforcer to the ground, and Caitlyn rushed over.*

Caitlyn: VIOLET i said no violence in this office.

Vi: Sorry Cait, but this asshole's gettin' a black e-

*Vi took the helmet off of the enforcer, and was stunned as jinx looked up at her.*

Jinx: So, you did the thing after all huh bitch mittens...?

Vi: H-holy... s-shit.

*Vi threw the helmet aside, and hugged Jinx.*

Vi: I thought... you....

Jinx: Made it pretty legit huh...?

*Vi buried her face in jinx's shoulder.*

Vi: You crazy ass bitch.

Jinx: YEAH, that's me alright... You're not gunna y'know go back to keeping my ass safe...?

Vi backed away lightly

Vi: I think You got that part covered sister.

Jinx: Guess I'll visit then...

Vi: Cool. 

Jinx: OK, well... see you losers... LATER!!!

Caitlyn: OH yes have it all get into my one GOOD eye. just, wonderful!

Roseline: I can't see! \*slips\*

Chapter one:

Lights out
Chapter 1

The man ran as fast as he could as the building behind him burst into flames, sirens could already be heard behind him, some faded slowly into the distance as he ran but others just came closer and closer every passing second. He pushed strands of hair out of his face as his breath grew heavier and more breathless, he couldn´t stop now. The sirens grew louder behind him as he kept sprinting as fast as his body would allow him, his long legs moving quickly to outrun the sirens growing louder and louder behind him. His boots thudded loudly on the ground with every quick and heavy step. His eyes caught a glimpse of a dark alleyway across the street, he looked around quickly, his eyes scanning for any oncoming danger. He took his chance and sprinted quickly towards the alleyway, jumping forward at the last second to dodge the police car coming at him from the side. He grunted as his body hit the ground before quickly getting up again and dusting himself off as he looked around in a hurry, his eyes scanning over the alleyway. The police car shot past the alleyway without noticing him as the sirens eventually faded into the distance. He let out a breathless chuckle before walking away towards the other way of the alley slowly as he heard some more sirens in the distance as the fire department finally arrived at the scene he left behind. His lips curled into a satisfied smirk as he walked through the alleyway. He watched as the morning sunlight seeped into the alleyway, he kept walking until he came across the local cafe, brushing off some dirt before walking in with the smirk still plastered to his face.

꒷꒦︶꒷꒦︶ ๋ ࣭ ⭑꒷꒦

He whistled a cheery tune as he entered the small local cafe, a small bell ringing as the door opened and closed behind him. His eyes scanned the small space before landing on a young woman sipping on some hot tea, he looked away after studying the woman for a few seconds. His gaze then landed on the counter where a familiar older man stood, smiling warmly at him. “Ah, welcome back Richard, long day at work?” The older man greeted him warmly. He approached the counter where the older man stood and nodded “long day might just be an understatement, Walter” he replied with a smile, mimicking the older man’s warmth. Walter chuckled softly before speaking again “the usual?” Walter raised his left eyebrow up slightly in a questioning manner. Richard nodded and Walter walked to the back to make his ‘usual’ order. While Richard waited he glanced to the right to see the young woman still sipping her tea calmly with a book in her hands, he tried to look at the cover of the book but he was unsuccessful. He sighed softly with slight disappointment before looking back at the counter to see Walter walking up to him and giving him his order, a simple black coffee and donut. “There you go, young man” Walter spoke up teasingly, knowing full well Richard didn’t like being called ‘young man’. “for the last time, i'm 23 not 17…” he corrected the older man with clear annoyance as he took his order and paid as Walter just chuckled. Richard then walked up to the table the young woman was sitting at and grabbed the chair sitting opposite of her and looked at her “Is this seat taken?” He asked the young woman, trying to charm her with a smirk. The young woman looked up from her book and nodded her head softly. He sat down anyway in the chair sitting opposite of her, the smirk still clear on his face “soooo~ what’s your name~?” His tone was rather flirty as the young woman set down her book with a sigh and looked at him. “I’ll tell you mine when you tell me yours” she spoke up as she crossed her arms and stared him down. “I suppose there’s nothing wrong with that~ the name´s Richard¨ he spoke up in a dramatic tone before reaching to shake her hand. She rolled her eyes at his attempt to shake her hand. He quickly took the hint and retracted his arm before she spoke up “I’m Ivory… Ivory Grimrose” she spoke up in a rather dry tone before taking another sip from her tea. He chuckled softly as he watched her put her book away “Ivory…” he repeated softly, testing how her name rolled over his tongue, the smirk on his lips widening at the pleasant feeling of saying her name. “your smile is so psychopathic…” she commented in the same dry tone. He chuckled softly as he rested his chin on his hands. “why thank you, dear” he thanked her while batting his eyes jokingly. She sighed as she took the last sip of her tea, setting the now empty glass down gently on the table. His eyes followed the glass before returning back to her eyes when the glass hit the table with a soft clink. As his eyes met hers again he opened his mouth to speak but before a sound could escape his mouth she interrupted 
“Why are you still holding your burning coffee in your hand?” she seemed to have wanted to ask that for a while now. his smirk dropped and his eyes widened as he sat straight up and looked at the coffee and donut in his hand, just now realizing he was still holding them. He smiled and laughed awkwardly as he set down his donut and steaming hot coffee, he glanced down at the hand he was holding the steaming coffee with and noticed the hand was pretty red and hot… how did he not notice his hand was basically burning? He looked back up at Ivory and noticed she was glancing at his hand before suddenly reaching out slowly and gently touching the balm of his burning hands, which felt hot to the touch. He felt the slight burning sensation now but it felt strangely better when she touched it gently. she sighed softly before speaking up “you’re such an idiot…” she looked up at him, her finger caressing his palm gently. “you do realize tha-” “Are you single?” he interrupted her bluntly with a smile. She looked him dead in the eyes, she looked rather insulted by his sudden interruption “no.” she showed no signs of lying so she must've been telling the truth, right? He was good at telling if people were being truthful or not, she showed no signs but it still felt… off, he couldn’t explain it. She suddenly broke eye contact and pulled her hand away to grab her phone and look at the time. his eyes followed her hand as he let out a small sound of protest at her not touching his hand. She checked the time and spoke up in a more neutral tone “I have to go,” he looked up at her with pleading eyes “what?” he was so close to getting her number! “Bye… Richard.” she spoke up quickly as she stood up and grabbed her bag from the chair next to her. He quickly stood up too and grabbed her wrist, he wasn’t going to let her leave like that. A snarl appeared on his lips as he spoke “I'm not letting you leave so soon…” he hissed at her angrily as his grip on her wrist tightened. She looked up at him “Well, you can’t stop me” she hissed back at him, her tone dripping with annoyance and yet still a bit of vulnerability. 
“Give me your number first” he hissed back sternly, his voice laced with anger as his grip on her tightened further. She winced at his tight grip before she spoke up again “Okay okay, fine! just let go!” she demanded angrily as the vulnerability in her voice got clearer. He loosened his grip but didn’t let go completely as he reached into his pocket with his free hand and pulled out his phone, handing it to her after opening the contact list. She hesitantly took his phone and typed in her number before giving it back to him. He took his phone back and put it back into his pocket, his face was still angry and firm as he reached to the back of her head and placed his free hand on the back of her head, his large hands were cold as he pulled her closer and leaned down. Her eyes widened and her cheeks reddened slightly as she felt his lips on hers, his lips were just as cold and firm as his hands, she started to reach up ever so slightly to try and hold him but he pulled away again before she could. she gasped softly as she looked back up at him. He let her wrist and back of her head go and leaned down slightly as his lips curled into a scowl before opening his mouth and taking a deep breath before talking again. “Now, I believe you said something about having to go?” he reminded her firmly as he put his arms behind his back. Her eyes widened a little for just a second as she remembered what she said before “oh, right, bye…” her cheeks were still slightly red as she rubbed the back of her head before starting to walk away, waving softly at him.

He watched her walk away and exit the cafe with an awkward blush, as soon as she was gone he chuckled to himself quietly “I sure love a blushing girl…” He muttered softly as his lips curled into a sinister smirk. He turned to Walter and nodded his goodbye. Walter nodded back with an amused smile as he watched Richard leave the cafe. Richard walked out of the cafe and turned left and started walking to his shitty apartment with his hands behind his back, the smirk still plastered on his face, just less sinister and more charming. after just fifteen minutes of walking he neared his apartment building, reaching into his pocket he grabbed his keys and lifted them to the lock on the door and unlocked the door to the apartment complex, walking inside he greeted the woman behind the desk as he walked over to the elevator, he pressed the button next to the elevator. as the door opened he slid inside, not even waiting for the door to open completely. With a smirk still plastered on his face he saw a familiar girl running towards the elevator. “HOLD THE DOOR!” the girl called in a panic as her bag swung every which way as she tried to run. His smirk widened as he recognized the girl from the cafe, Ivory. he watched with a smirk as the elevator doors started to close as she stumbled over in a panic. she was able to throw her bag into the elevator and slip through the doors just in time and she just then realized who she’d be in the elevator with… Richard. He watched her catch her breath with a sadistic smirk. Pathetic. “Well look who it is~ cafe girl, i thought you’d be further away by now~” he commented with a sadistic glint in his eyes as he looked down at her. After finally catching her breath she looked up at him, her brows furrowed with annoyance. “I simply took a detour” she resorted as she grabbed her bag and swung it back onto her back. She folded her arms with a slight pout as she looked up at him. He let out a small chuckle as he bent down to her size and reached his hand out to her hair, playing with it. “Well, it doesn’t matter anyways, but I'm curious… Since when do you live here? I’ve never seen you here before toda-” he asked curiously before being cut off by a thump, did the elevator get stuck? Both their eyes widened as they stood straight and looked around for a moment. He quickly regained his composure and smirked at her cheekily. She looked him dead in the eyes before speaking up “I just met you today…” she didn’t seem very pleased at the thought of being stuck in an elevator with him, she had to admit he was attractive…but still. She sighed in defeat when his smirk returned “I moved in a few days ago, happy now?” she answered his question from before in a sour ton as she avoided his gaze. He simply smirked wider as he bent down to her height once again “and where’s your boyfriend? Fiance? Husband?” he asked as the sadistic glint in his eyes only grew. She looked up at him with clear confusion “I’m single.” she told him. the confusion evident in her voice, her eyes then widened when she remembered she had told him she was taken back at the cafe. “I almost didn’t realize you were lying back at the cafe… Almost” he chuckled softly as he touched the tip of her nose with his index finger. He then stood straight up and backed away before sitting on the elevator floor with his back against the back wall of the elevator. Looking up at her with a softer smile as he patted on his lap, signaling for her to sit down. She walked over slowly, her soft steps barely audible against the elevator’s floor as she neared him before sitting down next to him. He looked at her with clear confusion, his hand still on his lap “why didn’t you sit down on my lap?” He asked with clear confusion and annoyance as he looked her in the eyes. She sighed as she sat with folded legs on the elevator’s floor “You can’t tell me what to do” she told him with some clear annoyance as she folded her arms to her chest. He suddenly picked her up by her waist and lifted her up into his lap. “Actually, I can,” he replied to her snarky comment in a cocky way as he wrapped his arms around her slender waist, resting his nose in her hair. “Fine, but you’re going to do something for me too.” she told him sternly as she sat angrily in his lap with her arms crossed before he lifted his nose from her hair and spoke up again “how about i move in with you so you’ll never be alone? you could think of me as your personal guard dog… and maybe even boyfriend~” he whispered in her ear teasingly, his cold breath hitting her warm skin tauntingly. “I’ll think about it, okay? but no promises” she told him sternly before he chuckled and grabbed her chin softly, turning her head towards his and giving her a teasing kiss on her lips. She looked at him rather shocked after he pulled away, he looked down at her with another chuckle “don’t pretend you didn’t like it~”

He eventually walked out of the elevator with 5 lipstick stains on his face and one red hand mark on his face, the smirk on his face still there as he stopped walking and looked behind him. He watched Ivory leave the elevator looking pissed and flustered at the same time, he chuckled softly as she walked past him and towards one of the doors in the long hallway of the apartment complex. He was filled with a sense of relief and disappointment at the fact they weren’t stuck in the elevator anymore, though he had a nice time he wasn't sure if he would've made it out alive if he was stuck with her any longer. He simply shrugged it off and walked to his apartment door and unlocked it with his key before opening the door and walking inside, closing the door behind him. He yawned as he walked through his apartment, walking past a mirror he stopped to look at his reflection. He slid his hand past the lipstick stains on his lips, forehead, cheek, neck and the collar of his blouse and the big red slap mark on his other cheek, he simply sighed before continuing through the apartment until he reached his bedroom. As soon as he entered he walked towards the curtains and closed them, he grabbed his phone from his pocket and dialed a number. As the number went through he tossed his phone onto his bed and took off his black vest, he knew the clothes he wore weren’t always practical but he couldn´t stand not looking good, he couldn´t let his beauty go to waste. Just as he unbuttoned the first two buttons of his blouse, the person he called picked up. He groaned as he walked to his bed and plopped down before grabbing his phone and putting it on speaker. “I saw the news, another success, huh?” the guy on the other end of the phone spoke up firmly. Richard scoffed as he got comfortable in bed “what did you expect? I’m a professional, Felix!” Richard’s booming laugh echoed through the apartment, he could barely hear Felix groaning on the other end “SHUT UP! you’re making my headphones ring, you dick!” Felix yelled from the other end, his voice shaking with anger as Richard just laughed harder before calming down “alright, alright! What's the next mission Felix the cat?” Richard chuckled as he calmed himself. “STOP COMPARING ME TO A CARTOON CAT!” Felix sounded furious as Richard just chuckled more “cry baby…” Richard muttered softly to himself, Felix sighed before speaking again “Alexander Silverwing requested to hire you to kill his wife, apparently she’s having an affair with one of his enemy’s minions. He told us she’s been telling the other guy his plans, this other guy of course then tells them his boss” Felix explained briefly as Richard hummed along in understanding. “So I have to kill Natasia Silverwing? has he mentioned how he wants it done?” His tone now serious as he fished for more information from Felix. “He wants you to ‘be creative’. get it done before next month and make sure they don’t know you did it.” Felix answered calmly before hanging up the phone, leaving Richard in silence. He simply shrugged before putting his phone on his nightstand and taking off his blouse. He yawned once more before getting out of bed and stretching before walking to the kitchen and grabbing a bottle of liquor from one of the cabinets. he opened a different cabinet  filled with different kinds of glasses before deciding “eh, i’ll just drink from the bottle” Not before long he got the liquor bottle open, taking a sip to see if it was still. “yep, that’s still good” he then walked back to his bedroom and jumped into bed, liquor spilling on the bedsheets a little. He simply shrugged it off and started drinking his liquor after turning on the tv that was mounted on the wall opposite of his bed. Eventually exhaustion finally took over and his eyelids grew heavier and heavier before closing, the bottle of liquor still in his hands and the tv still on.

 After what felt like seconds he opened his eyes again when he saw a shadowy figure standing in front of his bed, he blinked his eyes a few times. his sight still hazy “satan? aren’t you a bit too early?” he asked the figure with clear exhaustion before rubbing his eyes. as his vision cleared and his exhaustion drifted away he saw who the figure was… even worse than satan… His eyes went wide and he screamed on the top of his lungs as Ivory stood in front of his bed “WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING HERE!?” he yelled at her as she stood there with shock. “calm down, man, it’s only 7PM!” she put her hands up in a surrendering position as she reassured him. “Your door was unlocked and I just came in a few minutes ago…” she muttered as she pinched the bridge of her nose. “AND!?” he yelled at her angrily, still feeling some of the alcohol in his system. “I just wanted to tell you I thought about your offer and decided you can move in with me” she explained him calmly as she walked over to the side of his bed and sat down before taking his bottle of liquor, despite his sounds of protest, instead of listening to him she put his liquor bottle away and gave him a glass of water from his night stand. Taking the water he realized how thirsty he was, causing him to down the glass of water in one go and then pushing the empty glass into her hands “more…” he demanded gruffly as he whipped the excess water off his lips, smearing the lipstick stain on his lip. She chuckled as she saw the lipstick stains on his face from before, all smeared from his little ‘nap’. She simply shook her head softly as she took the empty glass and stood up, walking to the kitchen to refill it as Richard sobered up. After filling up the glass again with water, and some ice, she walked back into Richard’s bedroom as he sat straight up in bed. she sat back down on the edge of his bed and gave him his glass of icy water, he gladly took it and downed the whole thing, ice and all. She looked at him with slight worry as he swallowed those ice cubes like that. “Are you okay?” she asked him nervously, instead of a response she got a stare from him as he liked his lips. He then grabbed the back of her head to pull her closer and kiss her, but she quickly put one hand on his chest to push him away and one on his mouth as he tried to shower her with kisses. She then felt him licking her hand with a smirk, she quickly pulled her hand away. “EEEW!” She quickly expressed her embarrassment and disgust as she whipped her hand frantically on the bed sheets while he just chuckled playfully before giving her a short kiss on her head. She finished whipping her hand on his sheets and looked up at him, noticing he was already sobered up. “soooo~ about me moving in with you~ how about i live with you use this apartment as an office or party apartment~” he was immediately back to his flirty as he lay back down on bed, pulling her with him. “Sounds good to me.” she just shrugged as she was forced down on his chest playfully as he sniffed her hair. “hmm… What conditioner do you use?” he muttered against her head as he took another loooong sniff.

The next morning he began packing after calling the landlord to inform them about his plan, and after some bribery and slight threats, the landlord agreed. He grabbed one of the boxes and lifted it up into the air to rest it o his head as his hands supported the sides of the box before walking towards the front door, which was already open, and walking out and entering Ivory’s apartment to set down the box next to the bed in the guest room before going to get the next box, and the next, and the next, until all the boxes where at Ivory’s apartment so he could start unpacking everything.

Author: Ben Brown 

 Chapter One: Roots of Frustration  

Mr. Graham Connelly stood at the whiteboard, his marker squeaking against the surface as he sketched out a quadratic equation. His handwriting, precise and clean, belied the chaos simmering beneath his calm exterior. A quiet rage boiled in his chest, barely contained by the too-tight tie he wore as a symbol of institutional conformity.  



“X equals negative B, plus or minus the square root of B squared minus four AC, all over two A,” he recited, almost mechanically. His students stared back at him, some jotting down notes, others zoning out into the fluorescent-lit void. He couldn't blame them. Public school had a way of beating curiosity into compliance.  



The bell rang, and students shuffled out. Graham let out a sigh, tossing the marker onto the desk. His colleague, Morgan Tate, stepped into the room with a smile that almost seemed designed to annoy him. She was young, optimistic, and in love with teaching in a way he used to be.  



“You okay, Graham?” she asked, leaning on the doorframe.  



“Fine,” he replied, rubbing his temples. “Just tired of fighting a system designed to fail the people it should and could help.”  



Morgan shrugged. “Well, good thing we’re planting a garden this afternoon, right? Something about fresh air and dirt is good for the soul.”  



“Maybe,” Graham said, though he didn’t feel convinced. The class garden project was his attempt at giving his students something tangible, something real. But even that had been a bureaucratic headache—permits, paperwork, endless meetings about shovel safety. He was starting to think the quadratic formula was simpler than public school administration.  





 Chapter Two: Unearthing the Mystery  



The sun hung low in the sky, casting long, golden shadows over the school’s backyard as Graham stood, arms crossed, watching his students at work. The garden plot had been nothing more than a forgotten strip of dirt behind the cafeteria dumpsters, but now, after weeks of petitions and pep talks, it was on the verge of transformation. It was the only thing Graham had looked forward to in months—a project he’d taken on to inject some life and meaning into a job that had long since worn him thin.



The students shuffled around with their mismatched spades and trowels, tossing weeds and clumps of dirt into piles. A few of them were actually trying, but most were more interested in their phones or half-heartedly jabbing at the soil.



“Mr. Connelly, do we really have to do this? Can’t we just...buy vegetables from Walmart or something?” whined Benny, a perpetually slouching sophomore whose primary talent appeared to be delivering sarcasm with surgical precision.  



“Benny,” Graham said, pinching the bridge of his nose, “we’re trying to learn about sustainability. About growing something from scratch. You know, the value of effort?”  



Benny shrugged and poked the dirt again.  



Morgan appeared beside him, her arms folded, a grin pulling at the corners of her mouth. “You’ve got a real way with words, Graham,” she teased.  



“Don’t start,” he muttered, though a reluctant smile crept onto his face.  



Morgan was new—just a few years into her teaching career—but she had a knack for lighting up a room, for connecting with students in ways Graham envied. Where he saw apathy, she saw untapped potential. Where he felt suffocated by the system, she somehow thrived. It annoyed him, but it also reminded him of a time when he’d felt that way, too.  



A loud thunk interrupted his thoughts. The sound of metal striking something solid.  



“Uh...Mr. Connelly?” It was Benny again, his voice higher this time, tinged with uncertainty.  



Graham frowned and walked over. “What is it now?”  



“I think I hit something,” Benny said, staring at the ground. His spade stuck up at an odd angle, lodged in the soil.  



“Probably a rock,” Graham said, kneeling beside him. He reached down, brushing away the dirt with his hands.  



But as the soil cleared, a shape began to emerge. Pale. Angular.  



Graham froze.  



It wasn’t a rock. It was a hand.  



He yanked his hands back as if he’d been burned. His heart pounded in his chest. The hand—thin, bony, lifeless—was unmistakably human, the fingers curling upward in a claw-like gesture.  



The students crowded closer, craning their necks to see.  



“Everyone step back!” Graham barked, his voice cutting through the murmurs.  



“Is that—?”  



“Oh my God!”  



“Is that real?”  



“Yes, it’s real,” Graham snapped. “Step back. Now.”  



Morgan crouched beside him, her face pale but steady. “What the hell, Graham?”  



“I don’t know,” he muttered, digging cautiously around the hand to uncover more of the shape. The students watched from a safe distance, whispering to each other, some recording with their phones despite Graham’s protests.  



Within minutes, the top half of the body was visible. It was a man, or what was left of one, buried in a shallow grave. His skin was mottled, his clothes tattered and stained with dirt. The stench of decay hit them like a physical force.  



Morgan gagged and turned away, covering her mouth. “Jesus Christ.”  



“Go inside,” Graham said to the students, his voice low but firm.  



They didn’t move.  



“Now!” he shouted, and the kids scattered, sprinting toward the safety of the school building.  



Morgan wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and turned back to him. “What do we do?”  



Graham stared at the body, his mind racing. He’d taught about variables, about solving equations with incomplete information. But there was no formula for this. No neatly packaged solution.  



“We call the cops,” he said finally. “And then...we wait.”  



 

Chapter Three: Substituting Variables  



The parking lot was a sea of red and blue flashing lights. Squad cars lined the edge of the garden plot, yellow tape cordoning off the area. Officers moved with purpose, marking evidence, taking photos, speaking into radios.  



Graham and Morgan stood to the side, watching the scene unfold. Neither had spoken much since the discovery.  



A tall detective approached them, his face lined with weariness. “I’m Detective Harris,” he said, flashing a badge. “You’re the ones who found the body?”  



Graham nodded. “Me and my class.”  



Harris frowned, glancing at the students peeking out from the classroom windows above. “Hell of a field trip, huh?”  



“No kidding,” Graham muttered.  



Harris pulled out a notepad. “Did you notice anything unusual before today? Anyone hanging around the area? Strange activity?”  



Graham shook his head. “No. We’ve been out here off and on for a couple of days prepping the garden. Nothing like this.”  



Morgan cleared her throat. “Do you know who it is?”  



Harris glanced at her. “We’re still working on that. But the body’s been there for a while. Months, maybe longer.”  



“Who buries someone behind a school?” Morgan asked, incredulous.  



“That’s what we’re going to find out,” Harris said. He flipped his notebook shut. “You’re free to go, but stay available. We’ll need to talk to you again.”  



As the detective walked away, Morgan turned to Graham. “This isn’t just some random body, is it?”  



Graham rubbed the back of his neck, staring at the disturbed earth. “No,” he said quietly. “This is something else.”  



 Chapter Three: Substituting Variables  



The garden plot was empty now, except for the gaping hole where the body had been unearthed. The police had packed up hours ago, but the questions they left behind clung to Graham like the earthy smell of disturbed soil. He sat in his classroom, staring at the clock on the wall. It was nearing 7 p.m. The school was eerily silent, the fluorescent lights above humming softly like a distant hive.  



Morgan sat across from him, her chin resting on her hands. Between them, a half-empty pot of cold coffee and a laptop that had been open for an hour, its screen blank. She tapped a pen against the desk, a steady rhythm that echoed in the quiet room.  



“We’re not going to let this go, right?” she asked, breaking the silence.  



Graham sighed, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a police matter now. There’s nothing we can do.”  



Morgan raised an eyebrow. “Really? Because that’s not the vibe I got when you were out there today, telling everyone to step back like you were about to put on a detective’s badge.”  



He gave her a flat look. “I was just trying to keep the kids from traumatizing themselves. More than they already have, anyway.”  



“Fair,” she admitted. “But still. You saw how Detective Harris acted. Like this was just another box to check. If we don’t push, this whole thing could get buried again—no pun intended.”  



Graham stared at her, torn between irritation and admiration. He couldn’t deny she was right. Something about the way Harris had asked his questions, the way he’d avoided answering theirs, left a bad taste in Graham’s mouth.  



“Okay,” he said finally. “Say we do want to find out what happened. Where would we even start?”  



Morgan’s eyes lit up. She grabbed the laptop and started typing. “I already did some preliminary digging—figuratively, of course,” she said with a small grin.  



“Of course,” Graham said dryly.  



She turned the screen toward him. “There’s a missing person report from six months ago. Evan Coulter. Local guy, mid-thirties. Worked for the school district as a financial auditor. Disappeared without a trace.”  



Graham frowned, leaning closer to the screen. “You think the body is him?”  



“It lines up,” Morgan said. “The time frame, the location. And look at this—” She clicked another tab, pulling up an article from a local newspaper. “He’d been looking into some...questionable budget practices before he went missing. Something about unapproved contracts and missing funds.”  



Graham let out a low whistle. “So he uncovers some shady dealings, and suddenly he’s gone?”  



Morgan nodded. “That’s what it looks like.”  



“And then he winds up buried behind the school.”  



“Exactly.”  



Graham rubbed his temples, his mind spinning. He wasn’t a cop, but even he could see the pattern forming. If Coulter had uncovered corruption in the district, someone powerful enough to cover it up might have had a motive to get rid of him.  



“What’s our next move, Nancy Drew?” he asked, half-joking.  



Morgan grinned. “We need to get into the district archives. If Coulter found something, there might be a paper trail.”  



Graham raised an eyebrow. “You think they’re just going to hand us access?”  



“Of course not,” she said, her grin widening. “That’s why we’re going to be...creative.”  





 Chapter Four: Solving for X  



The district’s central office was a squat, nondescript building that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the 1970s. Graham and Morgan stood in the parking lot, the headlights of his aging Toyota casting long shadows on the cracked asphalt.  



“This is a terrible idea,” Graham said, his hands shoved deep into his coat pockets.  



“Probably,” Morgan agreed, pulling a small flashlight from her bag. “But it’s also the only idea we’ve got.”  



The plan was simple in theory: Morgan had a contact in the archives office—an old friend from college who owed her a favor. She’d arranged for them to “borrow” a keycard to get inside after hours. They’d have exactly thirty minutes to search before the night guard made his rounds.  



“Are you sure about this?” Graham asked as they approached the building.  



“Nope,” she said brightly, swiping the keycard. The door clicked open.  



Inside, the air was cool and stale, carrying the faint scent of old paper and mildew. The halls were dimly lit, the fluorescents buzzing faintly above. Morgan led the way to the archive room, her footsteps soft on the linoleum floor.  



The room itself was a maze of filing cabinets and cardboard boxes, each one labeled with years and categories. Morgan immediately went to work, pulling open drawers and scanning the contents. Graham stood by the door, his arms crossed, feeling like an accomplice in a low-budget heist movie.  



“Got it,” Morgan said after a few tense minutes. She held up a thick file labeled “Budget Reports 2023.”  



“Let me see,” Graham said, stepping closer.  



They spread the file out on a nearby table, flipping through the pages. At first, it looked like standard budgetary minutiae—numbers, charts, expense summaries. But then Morgan stopped, her finger hovering over a specific entry.  



“Here,” she said. “Look at this.”  



Graham peered at the page. The entry was for a construction project that had supposedly taken place last year—a major overhaul of the school’s HVAC system. The budget allocated for it was astronomical, far more than what such a project should have cost.  



“And here’s the kicker,” Morgan said, flipping to another page. “The company listed as the contractor doesn’t exist. I looked it up earlier.”  



Graham stared at her, his pulse quickening. “So the district funneled money to a fake company?”  



“Looks like it,” she said. “And my guess is Coulter figured it out.”  



Before Graham could respond, a noise outside the room made them both freeze. Footsteps.  



“Time’s up,” Morgan whispered, shoving the file into her bag.  



They slipped out of the room and down the hall, ducking into a stairwell just as the night guard’s flashlight beam swept past. Graham’s heart pounded as they made their way back to the car, their footsteps silent on the pavement.  



As they climbed inside, Morgan pulled the file from her bag and set it on the dashboard. “We’ve got them, Graham,” she said, her eyes shining with determination. “Now we just have to figure out what to do with it.”  





 Chapter Five: Midpoint Shift  



The coffee shop on the corner of Sycamore and Third was quiet at this hour, its warm, dim light spilling onto the rain-slicked pavement outside. Graham and Morgan sat in a booth near the window, the incriminating file spread out between them. The smell of fresh coffee mingled with the faint metallic tang of damp air as they leaned over the pages, whispering like conspirators.



“Okay,” Morgan said, tracing her finger across one of the documents. “This is the second entry for a phantom contractor. Look—here’s another payout for almost a quarter of a million dollars, supposedly for ‘consulting fees’ on a nonexistent technology upgrade.”



Graham rubbed his jaw, which had started to ache from clenching it. “Two fake companies. Hundreds of thousands of dollars funneled out of the district. If Coulter found this...no wonder someone wanted him gone.”



Morgan nodded. “And here’s the kicker. All of these payouts are signed off by the same person.” She flipped to the final page and pointed at a familiar name: Howard Bishop, the district superintendent.



Graham leaned back in his seat, his stomach sinking. Howard Bishop was a name everyone in the district knew. He was charming, respected, a staple of the local community. The kind of man who smiled for photo ops with parents at PTA meetings and gave polished speeches about the importance of education. The idea that he could be involved in something like this was staggering.



“This doesn’t just implicate Bishop,” Graham said slowly. “If the money’s gone, it means the school budgets are being drained. Programs cut. Resources we’re supposed to be giving to these kids—it’s all going into someone’s pocket.”



Morgan sipped her coffee, her lips pursed. “Yeah. But if we try to take this public, it won’t end well. You saw how Bishop operates. He’s got friends in high places.”



Graham stared out the window, watching the rain bead against the glass. She was right, of course. They couldn’t just march into the district office and start making accusations. Not without ironclad evidence. And even then, it might not be enough.



“So what do we do?” Morgan asked, her voice softer now. “Turn it over to the police? The media?”



Before Graham could answer, a shadow fell across the table. He looked up to see Detective Harris standing there, his coat dripping from the rain. His expression was unreadable, but his eyes lingered on the file for just a moment too long.



“Funny running into you two here,” Harris said, his tone conversational but laced with suspicion. “I was just about to call you, Mr. Connelly. Seems we’ve got some new developments in the case.”



Graham stiffened. “What kind of developments?”



“Well,” Harris said, sliding into the booth beside Morgan without being invited, “we identified the body. Evan Coulter. Worked for the district.” He smiled thinly, though there was no humor in it. “Strange coincidence, don’t you think?”



Graham’s mind raced. Harris wasn’t just fishing—he was watching, studying their reactions. Did he know about the file? Had he been following them?



Morgan, to her credit, didn’t miss a beat. “Strange is one word for it,” she said, folding her hands casually over the file. “So what’s the plan? Are you finally going to arrest someone?”



Harris chuckled, though it sounded forced. “Let’s just say we’re narrowing in on a few leads. This is a messy case. I’d hate for anyone to get...involved in something they don’t understand.”



Graham tensed. There it was—a warning, thinly veiled beneath polite conversation. Harris knew more than he was letting on, and the fact that he’d found them here wasn’t a coincidence.



“Well,” Morgan said, standing abruptly and grabbing the file, “we wouldn’t want to get in your way, Detective. Come on, Graham, let’s not overstay our welcome.”



Graham followed her out into the rain, their footsteps splashing against the puddle-soaked pavement. Once they were safely inside the car, Morgan slammed the door and let out a sharp breath.



“He’s in on it,” she said, her voice low and furious. “Harris. He’s protecting Bishop.”



Graham gripped the steering wheel tightly. “How do you know?”



“Think about it,” Morgan said. “How did he know we’d be here? And why hasn’t he made an arrest? He’s either stalling or covering for someone.”



Graham didn’t respond. His mind was spinning, recalculating. If Harris was involved, it meant they couldn’t trust the police. And if Bishop was as powerful as he suspected, taking this file to anyone else in the district was just as risky.



“We need a new plan,” he said finally.



Morgan nodded. “Something Bishop and Harris can’t control.”





 Chapter Six: Raising the Stakes  



The school felt different the next morning. Graham walked through the hallways, past clusters of students and teachers, feeling the weight of eyes on him. Whispers followed him, carried on the stale air of the building. By now, everyone knew about the body. But that wasn’t what unnerved him.



It was the feeling that someone was watching. Waiting.



Morgan caught up with him by his classroom. “You feel it, too?” she asked, her voice low.



He nodded. “Something’s off.”



She handed him a folded piece of paper. “This was in my mailbox this morning.”



Graham unfolded it, his stomach sinking as he read the single line scrawled in neat, blocky handwriting:  



“Drop it, or you’ll end up like him.”



Graham crumpled the note in his fist, his jaw tightening. “They’re trying to scare us.”



“Yeah, well, it’s working,” Morgan admitted, though her tone was defiant. “But I’m not backing down.”



“Neither am I,” Graham said. He glanced down the hallway, his eyes narrowing. “But we need to be careful. No more late-night break-ins. No more coffee shop meetings.”



Morgan nodded. “Agreed. What’s the next move?”



Graham hesitated, weighing their options. “We take it public. But not to the cops or the district. Someone bigger. Someone they can’t shut up.”



Morgan frowned. “Like who?”



“Journalists,” Graham said. “Investigative reporters. They’ll dig deeper than we can, and they won’t stop until this thing blows wide open.”



Morgan’s expression brightened. “I know someone. A friend from college. She works for the Tribune.”



“Perfect,” Graham said. “Let’s give her a call.”



But as they turned toward his classroom, Graham couldn’t shake the feeling that the walls were closing in. That someone, somewhere, was already one step ahead.



 Chapter Seven: Hero's Grit  



Graham sat in his car in the parking lot outside the school, gripping his phone so tightly his knuckles turned white. The windshield wipers squeaked rhythmically as they swept away the drizzle falling from the gray November sky. He scrolled through his contacts and found the name Morgan had given him: Jessica Hill, an investigative journalist with the Tribune.  



""She'll listen,"" Morgan had said that morning. ""And if she takes the story, there's no way Bishop can stop it.""  



But as Graham stared at the name on his phone, he hesitated. It wasn’t fear for himself that made his thumb hover over the call button. It was the thought of what might happen to Morgan—and the kids. He thought of Benny, of Sarah and her constant questions, of all the students who would be caught in the fallout if this thing blew up in the wrong way. Then he thought of the life opportunities all his students were denied by perpetual lack of funds, now intensified by the greed and corruption of privileged individuals who were supposed to aid and protect his students.



His thumb pressed the button.  



The line rang twice before a sharp, professional voice answered. “Jessica Hill.”  



“Ms. Hill,” Graham said, his voice low. “My name is Graham Connelly. I’m a teacher at Norwood High, and I’ve got a story for you. One that involves corruption, embezzlement, and—” He hesitated, the weight of the words catching in his throat. “And a murder.”  



There was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by a slight intake of breath. “Go on,” she said.  



That evening, Jessica Hill sat in Graham’s living room, her laptop open on the coffee table, her fingers flying across the keyboard. Morgan sat on the couch beside her, the file they’d retrieved from the archives spread out between them. Graham paced back and forth, every so often glancing out the window as though expecting headlights to appear in the driveway.  



“You weren’t kidding,” Jessica said, pausing to look up at them. “This is big. If these documents are legit, this is easily the biggest scandal this district has ever seen. Probably bigger.”  



“They’re legit,” Morgan said firmly.  



“And you’re sure about the body?” Jessica asked, her expression skeptical but intrigued.  



Graham nodded. “It was him. Evan Coulter. Detective Harris confirmed it.”  



Jessica leaned back, crossing her arms. “Okay, here’s the problem. If what you’re saying is true, Bishop isn’t just embezzling. He’s got a cop in his pocket, and he’s willing to kill to keep this quiet. If I start digging into this, there’s no guarantee he won’t come after me. Or you.”  



“We know the risks,” Morgan said. “We just need this out in the open. Once it’s public, he won’t be able to hide.”  



Jessica studied them for a moment, her sharp eyes narrowing. “You’re braver than most people I meet,” she said finally. “Or crazier. Either way, I’ll take the story.”  



Relief flooded Graham’s chest, but it was short-lived. Jessica’s phone buzzed on the coffee table, the screen lighting up with an incoming call. She frowned, picking it up.  



“It’s a blocked number,” she said.  



“Don’t answer it,” Morgan said quickly.  



But Jessica shook her head, her curiosity getting the better of her. “Hello?”  



She listened for a moment, her face darkening. Then she ended the call and looked at them. “They know,” she said.  



Graham’s stomach dropped. “What did they say?”  



“Just a warning. A friendly suggestion to stop what I’m doing.”  



Morgan cursed under her breath.  



Jessica closed her laptop and began packing up the file. “If they’re this quick to react, it means we’ve hit a nerve. I’ll take these documents back to my office and get started. But I’m not going to lie to you—this is going to get messy.”  



“We’re ready,” Graham said, though he wasn’t sure he believed his own words.  



Jessica gave him a curt nod and headed for the door. “I’ll be in touch. And watch your backs.”  





 Chapter Eight: Approaching Climax  



By the next morning, the tension was palpable. The whispers that had been confined to the hallways were now spreading into classrooms and offices. Graham could feel the weight of invisible eyes on him as he taught his first period math class. Even Benny, who usually couldn’t care less about anything, seemed unusually quiet.  



Halfway through the lesson, Morgan appeared at his door, her face pale. She motioned for him to step outside.  



“What is it?” he asked, his heart sinking.  



“Jessica,” Morgan said, her voice trembling. “She was in a car accident last night. Her car was run off the road.”  



Graham’s blood ran cold. “Is she—?”  



“She’s alive,” Morgan said quickly. “But she’s in the hospital. Her laptop was destroyed in the crash, and she thinks someone tampered with her brakes.”  



Graham leaned against the wall, his head spinning. “They’re trying to shut us down.”  



Morgan nodded, her jaw set. “But they didn’t get the file. Jessica emailed me a backup before she left last night.”  



Relief mingled with dread. “So what now?”  



Morgan looked him straight in the eye. “We take it to the media ourselves. Tonight.”  



That evening, Graham and Morgan sat in a diner on the outskirts of town, waiting. Morgan’s contact at the Tribune had agreed to meet them, but Graham couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched. The weight of the backup file in his bag felt heavier than it should have, like it contained not just documents but their futures.  



When the door to the diner swung open, both of them stiffened. But instead of Morgan’s contact, it was Detective Harris. He spotted them immediately and made a beeline for their table.  



“We need to talk,” he said, sliding into the booth across from them.  



“We don’t have anything to say to you,” Morgan said coldly.  



Harris leaned forward, lowering his voice. “Listen to me. You think you’re exposing corruption, but you’re in way over your heads. Bishop’s not the one pulling the strings here. He’s just a cog in the machine. You go public with this, and you’ll be painting targets on your backs for people a lot scarier than him.”  



“Why are you telling us this?” Graham asked, his voice tight.  



“Because I don’t want to see you end up like Coulter,” Harris said. “You’re good people. But if you keep pushing, you’re not going to like what happens next.”  



He stood, tossing a few bills on the table to cover their untouched coffee. “Consider this your final warning.”  



As he walked out, Morgan turned to Graham, her eyes blazing with determination.  



“They’re scared,” she said. “And that means we’re winning.”  



Graham wasn’t so sure.  





 Chapter Nine: Climax Setup  



The school auditorium was packed. Rows of folding chairs creaked under the weight of parents, teachers, students, and staff, all gathered for the district’s annual budget meeting. Normally, these meetings were a dull formality—PowerPoint slides, jargon-heavy reports, and polite applause for another year of balanced books. But tonight was different.  



Tonight, Graham and Morgan were going to expose everything.  



Graham stood backstage, clutching the backup file in his hands. His palms were slick with sweat, his heart pounding in his chest like a drumbeat. Morgan stood beside him, her phone in hand, scrolling through a string of last-minute text messages from Jessica. The journalist had insisted on being part of the presentation remotely, despite the injuries she’d sustained in the crash.  



“You ready?” Morgan asked, her voice steady despite the storm swirling around them.  



“No,” Graham admitted, tugging at his collar. “But let’s do it anyway.”  



The plan was simple: during the public comment period, Morgan would take the microphone and lay out the evidence—fake contractors, embezzled funds, the connection to Coulter’s murder. The file contained enough documentation to leave no room for doubt. And with Jessica watching live from her hospital bed, ready to post the story online as soon as they spoke, there would be no way to contain it.  



The superintendent, Howard Bishop, sat in the front row, flanked by district officials and board members. He looked calm, even jovial, as he chatted with the woman beside him. But when his eyes met Graham’s, a flicker of something cold passed between them.  



“He knows,” Graham muttered.  



“Let him know,” Morgan said, her voice fierce. “We’ve got the truth on our side.”  



The meeting began, the hum of conversation fading as Bishop took the stage. He was charismatic as ever, delivering a smooth opening speech about the district’s “commitment to excellence” and “ongoing progress” despite budget challenges. The audience nodded along, a few even clapping.  



Graham’s stomach churned. How many of them knew the truth—or suspected it—but kept quiet out of fear or complicity?  



When the public comment period finally arrived, Morgan stepped forward, clutching the microphone with steady hands. Her voice rang out clear and confident as she introduced herself and began to speak.  



“At first glance, the district’s budget may seem normal,” she said, pulling a single sheet from the file and holding it up. “But what you don’t see on these spreadsheets is the money that’s missing—funneled into fake contracts, siphoned away by people who think no one will notice.”  



A murmur rippled through the crowd. Bishop’s face remained impassive, but his fingers tightened around the arms of his chair.  



Morgan continued, flipping through the file and projecting pages onto the large screen behind her. “This isn’t speculation. It’s documented. Here’s proof of a $400,000 payment to a nonexistent contractor. And here’s another for $250,000.”  



The crowd’s murmurs grew louder. Parents whispered to each other. Teachers exchanged shocked glances.  



“And that’s not all,” Morgan said, her voice rising. “When Evan Coulter, a district financial auditor, discovered this corruption, he tried to report it. But before he could, he disappeared. Six months later, his body was found buried behind Norwood High.”  



The auditorium erupted into chaos.  



“Quiet!” Bishop bellowed, standing from his chair and glaring at Morgan. “This is outrageous. These are baseless accusations!”  



“They’re not baseless,” Morgan shot back. “The proof is right here.”  



Graham stepped forward, holding the file aloft. “This is the truth,” he said, his voice trembling but firm. “You can try to deny it, but the evidence speaks for itself.”  



Bishop’s face turned red. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re just—”  



“Just what?” Graham cut in, his frustration boiling over. “Just a teacher? Just someone who’s tired of watching kids lose opportunities because people like you are lining their pockets?”  



The room fell silent for a moment, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife.  



And then the lights went out.  





 Chapter Ten: The Climax  



The auditorium plunged into darkness, broken only by the faint glow of cell phone screens. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd, followed by panicked whispers.  



“What’s going on?” Morgan whispered, her voice tense.  



“Stay close,” Graham said, grabbing her arm.  



Before he could say anything else, a loud bang echoed through the room. It wasn’t a gunshot—more like a door slamming open. Heavy footsteps thudded across the stage, and Graham felt a rush of air as someone brushed past him in the darkness.  



“Who’s there?” he called, his voice cutting through the chaos.  



No response.  



A flashlight beam suddenly sliced through the dark, illuminating the stage. It was Harris, the detective, holding the light in one hand and a gun in the other.  



“Everyone stay where you are!” he barked.  



Graham squinted against the glare. “Harris? What the hell are you doing?”  



Harris ignored him, his flashlight scanning the crowd. “Where’s Bishop?”  



There was a scuffle near the back of the stage, and then the superintendent appeared, flanked by two men in suits. Bishop looked shaken, his usual composure slipping as he shouted something Graham couldn’t hear over the rising noise.  



Harris stepped forward, his gun trained on Bishop. “Howard Bishop, you’re under arrest for fraud, embezzlement, and obstruction of justice.”  



The crowd erupted again, this time with a mix of cheers and shouts of confusion.  



Bishop raised his hands, his face twisting with anger. “You don’t know what you’re doing, Harris! You’ll regret this!”  



“Maybe,” Harris said, cuffing him. “But at least I’ll still be able to sleep at night.”  



Graham and Morgan exchanged stunned glances. For weeks, they’d assumed Harris was working for Bishop, but now it was clear he’d been playing a deeper game.  



As Bishop was led away, Harris turned to Graham and Morgan. “I told you to stay out of it,” he said gruffly. “But I guess I owe you one. Without that file, we wouldn’t have had enough to bring him down.”  



“Wait,” Graham said, his mind racing. “If you were on this case all along, why didn’t you tell us?”  



Harris smirked. “Because you two are terrible at keeping secrets. Bishop had eyes everywhere. If he’d gotten wind of what we were doing, this whole operation would’ve gone up in smoke.”  



Morgan crossed her arms. “So you just let us think you were the bad guy?”  



Harris shrugged. “Seemed like the easiest way to keep you out of trouble. Clearly, it didn’t work.”  





 Chapter Eleven: Resolution  



The next day, the story broke wide open. Jessica’s article, combined with footage from the meeting and statements from Harris, sent shockwaves through the community. Bishop’s arrest was only the beginning—more officials were implicated as the investigation deepened.  



Graham sat in his classroom, staring at the empty desks. For the first time in years, he felt a strange sense of peace. The system wasn’t fixed, not by a long shot. But at least now, there was hope.  



Morgan appeared in the doorway, holding two cups of coffee. “You okay?” she asked, setting one down on his desk.  



“Yeah,” he said, smiling faintly. “I think I am.”  



“So,” she said, leaning against the desk. “What’s next for you, Mr. Connelly?”  



He laughed softly. “I don’t know. Maybe I’ll finally write that book I’ve been thinking about.”  



“Paperback Writer?” she teased.  



“It was a hit for The Beatles. Why not build on the shoulders of giants?” he said, taking a sip of coffee.  



And for the first time in a long time, Graham felt like the ending of this chapter was just the beginning of something new.

1gyyb4h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyyb4h,Veldskoen Chukkas,"I've had these Veldskoen chukka boots for about a week, and they've already become a favourite. As a South African, owning these boots feels particularly special. It's not just about the quality, it's about knowing they come from a brand with roots in South African craftsmanship and history. I've been a loyal user of Jim Green boots, another fantastic South African brand, which are perfect for rugged outdoor adventures. However, these Veldskoen chukkas bring something different to the table - comfort, style, and versatility in a design that transitions nicely between casual and smart occasions.

From the moment I tried them on (ordered unseen from the website), I could tell these were well-made. The leather is soft yet sturdy, and the fit felt natural right away--no stiff break-in period or discomfort, just an immediate sense of ease. The soles strike a perfect balance between support and flexibility, making them comfortable for everything from a quick coffee run to a day of errands or an evening out. Over the past week, I've worn them extensively, and I haven't experienced any discomfort or blisters, which is often rare. 

Their versatility is a standout feature. I've paired them with jeans and a T-shirt for a relaxed look, and they worked just as well with chinos and a blazer for a smarter outfit. They've already become my go-to footwear because they just work with everything.

The build quality is just as impressive. The stitching is strong, the soles are durable, and the leather feels like it'll age beautifully over time. I'm also looking forward to seeing them develop a patina. 
  
I'm thrilled with these boots and can confidently say I'll be buying more from Veldskoen in the future. Between these and my trusty Jim Green boots, I now have two pairs of South African-made footwear that cater to different needs. These chukkas have truly impressed me with their comfort, versatility, and quality. Veldskoen has earned a loyal customer, and I can't wait to explore the rest of their range.",7,1732474235.0,goodyearwelt,4,0.89,False

Growing up I noticed that it’s super normal for brothers to have a lot more freedom. Bro can roll in at 3 a.m no questions asked. But if sis wants to grab coffee at 8 p.m the whole neighborhood finna talk. Why is it that brothers get all the freedom while sisters get all the judgment?
this double standard often comes from old cultural beliefs about family honor and gender roles. The idea is that the brother’s actions don’t reflect badly on the family, while the sister’s actions can. It’s crazy when you think about it, Why does it always feel like a man’s reputation stays his own, but a woman’s reputation feels like it’s tied to the whole family’s name?
I know it’s not just me lots of girlies I’ve talked to say they’ve experienced the same thing. Some say it’s due to deep-rooted traditional views, while others think it’s because of a fear of what the society might say about a girl’s choices

A bit of background. I am 35M, have had generalized anxiety my entire life and diagnosed with mild depressive disorder. I am extremely high functioning, have a lotta friends, travel, restaurants, sports, good career etc but while externally I always look happy and am having a good time. Internally my emotions are generally just a 5/10 in terms of happiness all the time, no matter how amazing the current activity i'm doing. My depression coupled with the pandemic also started to affect my sex drive, and generally at home I was never really feeling super good. I would have sparks of motivation which would then just burn out quite quickly. Took Remeron/mirtazapine for 9 month last year but it caused horrendous weight gain (55 lbs), while i felt great on it, physically my body started to suffer so I had to stop. A year later my psych recommended wellbutrin, here is my timeline and all the effects. I have also suffered bad bursts of chronic back pain my entire life due to spinal injury when I was much younger.

My Anxiety with wellbutrin before start: Its sad to admit, but i've been drinking since I was 13. While I only drink once or twice a week, alcohol is just a big part of my social interactions with most groups I hang out with. I also love wine pairing and fine dining, I was afraid Id have to stop all that on wellbutrin and be completely sober. Coffee is also A MASSIVE part of my life =(.

  
Wellbutrin XL 150 mg Timeline:

Day 1 - 3 - Intense Side effects:

* brain fog but also with a weird focus that tries to continuously focus on the fact that I have brain fog... 
* Intense nausea at night
*  Headpressure, feel like something is just constantly pushing on my skull from the inside and heavy feeling head.
* Any amount of caffeine would spiral anxiety and heartrate like crazy.
* Forcing myself to eat
* Sleep is good - up 8 hours from just 4 - 5 hours a night, but VIVID dreams and bad headache when I wake up.
* Side effects not bad enough to stop work, but taking it easy.

Day 3 - 6 - Side effects normalizing:

* Nausea completely gone
* Food somehow tastes a little better, especially my own cooking
* Motivation to work out greatly increased. Where before I would make 100 excuses before finally dragging myself to the gym everyday which would be a constant background battle. I started to just decide that I needed to workout and poof id be at the gym. Procrastination and the ""whats the point feeling"" dissipating a little.
* Find myself oddly smiling sometimes, without always telling myself to smile.
* Sleep good at 8 - 10 hours, still bad headaches whenever I wake up
* DEHYDRATION - lost 5 lbs of water weight in 5 days. Started to get a little scared, but found its a common side effect, started drinking a lot more water.
* Still cant have any amount of caffeine without heartrate rapidly climbing.
* Still bad Head Pressure

Day 6 - 10 - Body getting used to Wellbutrin:

* Bursts of general happiness and motivation throughout the day, not continuous but welcome.
* Mind starting to automatically break out of spirals of thinking about every bad thing thats ever happened and every regret. Starting to feel happy about everything i've accomplished this year (bought a house, took multiple vacations, work promotion). Being single and loveless bothering me a lot less (last relationship was 2 years ago).
* Headpressure gone
* Minor headache when I wake up, sleep is normalized to 7 - 8 hours. Still VIVID dreams but used to that now, feels like i'm getting 3x the amount of DEEP sleep. Wake up feeling a lot rested. 
* Can have half a cup of coffee in the morning now, still causes some anxiety but quickly disappears, may switch to decaf in several weeks.
* Tried drinking for the first time on it. Definitely much less alcohol tolerance than before, where a bottle of wine would just get me tipsy before, 3 - 4 drinks (wine) was just enough for me with LOTS of water and spaced out. No really bad effects the next day, but can definitely feel wellbutrin just kinda stop working for like 12 - 14 hours. Like my sadness and my anxiety would just go back to being what it was before it. And then would recover after a time. As I have minor depression and high drug and alcohol tolerance and have never had a seizure, I can handle 3 - 5 drinks on it no problem. but I feel if you have a MAJOR depressive disorder or have had seizures, STAY AWAY FROM ALCOHOL.
* BACK PAIN IS JUST GONE?!!! my back pain used to be in 2 stages, first would be pain in the area of injury (torn spinal disk which has healed but not well) this is manageable and recovers quickly. The second stage would be nerve pain, where pain would radiate throughout my lower back and cause muscle spasms and just ruin my life. Sometimes for 3 - 4 days, sometimes for 2 weeks if i've overworked my back in a bad way.... On Wellbutrin, the nerve pain was just GONE! No more muscle spasms. No more continuous pain. Just small bursts of it at the injury area if i do aggravate it. THIS IS HEAVEN. 

Day 14 - 17 - Fully used to wellbutrin:

* Alcohol reactions are lessened a lot. Still there though, but i've just capped myself to 3-4 drinks a week and thats it. I am finding this way I can do all the social stuff that involves alcohol and have no issues.
* I was a chain smoker that quit 12 years ago. While i dont ever smoke anymore, I still need a nicorette spray or gum from time to time (smoking aid) during a stressful day. On wellbutrin the need for it has completely disappeared.
* Morning headaches are much lessened and only last 15 - 20 minutes.
* SEX DRIVE is 2X-ed. I feel i'm 20 again with regards to erections, my absolute want and need for a woman's touch etc. Orgasms LAST, like I feel the satisfaction, calm and just general warm fuzzies for like an hour after an orgasm.
* Brain is starting to just no longer spiral into depressive thoughts often. I still have them, but my mind automatically responds with ""i'm glad i'm here, and look at all you've accomplished"" following with feelings of pride. Still unclear if this is a placebo effect.
* Feelings of euphoria now and then, or maybe not euphoria but just feeling the happiness others feel in short bursts which feels like euphoria to me.
* 5 lbs of waterweight down and 2 lbs of actual weight down. I'm eating the same amount but have a LOT more motivation to cook, and go to the gym 5 - 6 times a week without breaking a sweat ever since starting the meds. Endorphins from workouts FEEL SO GOOD. Like you feel that workout high for a couple of hours easy where it would just drop for me in half hour before.
* Back pain still gone/blunted. Will take this medication forever if I dont have to deal with that aspect.
* Far less of a bad reaction to coffee in the morning (half cup only) but still not the best feeling.
* Some days the anxiety is much worse even though the depression feels like its managed. But its easier to deal with since I dont feel like i'm fighting a war on two fronts all the time.

A lot of info here, but I hope this will help others who are looking to atleast give wellbutrin a shot. My experience on it so far at about 2.5 weeks has been nothing but positive overall other than the first 3 - 4 days. Hoping to take this long term even if some of these effects will greatly lessen due to the ""honeymoon"" effect. Which i'm fine with. If 8 weeks in i'm still going to the gym regularly, I am having less depressive spiraling thoughts and my back pain is still blunted i'll be a happy camper and would want to be on it for the rest of my life.

I am a Durham resident and an entrepreneur. I want to present the following opportunity to two people who are interested.

I am building a web and mobile app for local Durham residents to find dates, friends and activity partners. I thought what could be best than to present the opportunity to Ontario Tech students. I am looking for two people, who can help me build an MVP from scratch, and hopefully develop and maintain the full app once we succeed.

**Ideal profile**

* **Lead the Tech and Product Development**: Take charge of the technical architecture, development, and roadmap. You’d have a lot of autonomy to make technical decisions, and you’d be involved in every aspect of product development.
* **Full Stack**: Possess knowledge/experience in full stack development. You could both have experience in this field, or one can be an expert in front end and other in backend.
* **Build, Test, and Iterate**: I’m looking for someone with a strong drive to create and test quickly. I’m not aiming for perfection in the MVP; I’m aiming for validation and a product we can be proud of together.
* **Split or Own Design**: We can discuss design; if it’s not your strong suit. We could hire someone later, but if UI/UX something you can own, that’s a huge bonus.
* **Collaborate and Communicate**: This isn’t a solo mission for either of us; I want someone who’s ready to work openly, share ideas, meet regularly and work collaboratively through every step.

**What has been done so far:**

I have 140 signups so far, who are eagerly waiting for the first version of the app. I am not a developer, so I used no code tools such as Softr and Airtable to build an MVP, but I am hitting roadblocks due to the platform's limitations. I have the requirements clearly laid out for the MVP in Jira. I have a monetization plan.

**What's in it for you:**

I have two options, choose what you like -

* **Contractor**: $CAD 1,000 to build the app in next two months. For two people, it will be $500 each.
* **Equity**: If you think long term, I will offer a fair Equity Model. You will be partners in the company and will own the technical development and maintenance of the app. Ask me more about this if you are curious.

It will be a great learning opportunity by working on a real-life startup app. It could look great on your resume as it would differentiate yourself from others.

**More about me:**

I am in my late 40s, and I currently work with a large bank in Canada (yes, this is a side gig for me). I possess more than 20 years of experience in Product Management, Sourcing/Vendor Management and Sales. I am an MBA grad (2013) from Schulich School of Business (York U). I have some experience in building apps, and I will act as Business Partner and as a Product Manager for this gig.

I know someone, who graduated from Ontario Tech University as a software engineer, so I know UOIT has some of the greatest minds. If you are ready to show the world what you are made of, please comment below, send me a DM or write to me at [durhamdateson@gmail.com](mailto:durhamdateson@gmail.com)

**Selection Process:**

* You will send me your resume
* You will send me a one pager on
   * your short-term and long-term goals. Why do you want to this project?
   * How would you approach this project if you were doing it alone?
   * What tech stack would you use and what features would you enable?
   * How much time can you dedicate every week towards this project? I understand you guys are still in school.
* I will reach out to the shortlisted candidates over email for a phone conversation.
* I will schedule a face-to-face coffee chat
* I will make a final decision and communicate to the selected.",0,1732474028.0,uoit,1,0.5,False

That was the first of many more things that she believes happened in her life. 
 
Let's go ahead and start with my mother believing that she was a failed abortion. My grandparents were not the best parents; they disowned my mom several times throughout her life, and they were always cold and distant. Turns out my grandmother had cheated on my grandfather while he was in the Navy, and she aborted it at home and then proceeded to bury it in a coffee can in the yard. Naturally, with this information, my mother believes that my grandmother had also tried to abort her years beforehand. 
 
Growing up, I had to always hear about how there were microphones in the walls listening to us. Whenever something like an account or social security number had to be said, instead it was written down on a piece of paper. There were other things too that she didn't want to have said out loud. Hard to remember when it's been almost 30 years. 
 
There was also that one time she believed she was on Oprah. I think it had to do with one time we were in traffic and there was a news van behind us. My mom realized that the chewing gum that was originally in my mouth was now caught up in my bangs, and her being the perfectionist she is, immediately whipped out her comb and began to try combing the gum out as quickly as possible while my dad fought through traffic.

So about 2-3 years ago, I bought my girlfriend a Delonghi Dedica EC785. Back then I wasn't really into coffee but that changed over the past couple of months and I got especially into espresso and started to use the Dedica myself. I also started to buy more expensive (but hopefully better quality) espresso from local breweries , but already fully grinded. 

I keep reading that freshly grinded espresso tastes much better so I started to look into this topic. I initially came across the Timemore Chestnut and the Comandante, but read that these are only amazing for pour over but but necessarily for espresso (although it seems that this can changed for the Comandante by upgrading it with this red clicks (?) set which makes an already expensive grinder even more expensive). I did read through other posts in this sub reddit and the Kingrinder K6 and the 1zpresso J Ultra seem to get suggested quite frequently, especially for espresso. 

Considering my current setup with the Delonghi Dedica, would a Kingrinder K6 or a 1zpresso J Ultra make a difference in taste, and if so which one would you recommend? Or does a decent grinder only make a difference if I also upgrade from the Delonghi Dedica to a new and different coffee machine? 

TLDR: Kingrinder K6 or 1zpresso J Ultra (or none) for Delonghi Dedica?

I have GERD, and occasionally take Gaviscon when I get a flareup.

This morning after lunch, I felt like I had something stuck in my teeth; like a popcorn shell. I pulled it out with my thumb; it was a chunk of my incisor, right above the gumline. I've got a dentist appointment tomorrow; I'm American, but on vacation in the EU right now, so not sure how this is going to go. It doesn't hurt at all, but the fact that the chip occurred this easily is really alarming to me.

I've attached a picture below of the bottom row of my teeth. You can see the chip in the right front incisor. How bad do things look for me?

I'm excited to share my port of a resonator module to the Versio platform! This adaptation brings the magical sound of modeled resonators to the Noise Engineering ecosystem, with some enhanced features like increased polyphony.

The Versio is quickly becoming my favorite module ever - I can use it to basically prototype and test new modules that I'm unsure of before going out to get a dedicated module.

So if you're like me, don't have a Rings (or want another one), but are unsure of how it might fit in your case, try this firmware! It's a pretty much 1:1 replica of Rings, with some nuances in how normalization is handled.

Thank you for to u/Careful_Camp5153 for testing the first rendition of this firmware! They have kindly made a demo video:

**Knobs**

\- \*\*Knob 1 (Frequency)\*\*: Controls the fundamental frequency of the resonator

\- \*\*Knob 2 (Structure)\*\*: Adjusts the harmonic structure of the resonance

\- \*\*Knob 3 (Brightness)\*\*: Shapes the overall timbral brightness

\- \*\*Knob 4 (Damping)\*\*: Controls how quickly the resonances decay

\- \*\*Knob 5 (Position)\*\*: Sets the excitation position

\- \*\*Knob 6 (V/OCT)\*\*: Voltage per octave control

\- \*\*Knob 7 (Model)\*\*: Selects between different resonator models

**Mode Switches**

\- \*\*Switch A\*\*: Easter Egg Mode

\- \*\*Switch B\*\*: Normal Operation

\- \*\*Switch C\*\*: Debug/Calibration Mode

**Triggering Modes**

\- \*\*Switch X\*\*: Auto-strums on note changes (Knob 6) or excitor onsets (transient detection on In L)

\- \*\*Switch Y\*\*: Auto-strums only on excitor onset detection

\- \*\*Switch Z\*\*: Manual strumming via FSU button/input (Note: Input signal on In L will still produce output - if anyone with a Rings module could confirm if this is standard behavior, please let me know!)

**Calibration Instructions**

1. Move switch ABC to the C position.
2. Enter calibration mode by holding FSU button for 3 seconds.
3. Watch for slowly pulsing red LEDs to confirm calibration mode
4. Turn Knob 6 fully counter-clockwise
5. Connect a voltage source capable of 1V and 3V to the Knob 6 CV input
6. With voltage source at 1V, press the FSU button
7. The RED LEDs will start pulsing faster
8. With voltage source at 3V, press the FSU button
9. Calibration settings will be saved when the unit returns to blue LED debug mode

\*Note: Calibration settings are preserved between power cycles\*

# Current Features and Future Updates

**Enhanced Polyphony**

This port includes an upgraded polyphony capability of 8 voices (compared to the original's 4 voices). This enhancement is currently enabled by default.

**Coming Soon**

\- Implementing controllable polyphony modes

\- More control over normalization

\- Additional refinements based on user feedback

Feel free to ask any questions about this port! I'd be happy to share more details about the implementation or help troubleshoot any issues, and will share the code soon.

If you’re here, you probably know what I mean when I say it’s like carrying an invisible, overly stuffed backpack. It’s loaded with every “what-if,” every overthought moment, and every irrational fear. It’s heavy, it’s exhausting, and sometimes, it feels impossible to carry. But hey, you’re not alone—I’m right there with you, and so are so many others.

I wanted to share some things that have actually helped me. These aren’t cure-alls or magic fixes, just small, practical tools I’ve picked up along the way. Hopefully, one or two of them resonate with you too.

1.  **The Magic of Breathing (No, Really!)**
   * When I first heard people say, “Just breathe,” I wanted to roll my eyes. Like, how is breathing supposed to fix the chaos in my brain? But here’s the thing: it really can help. Controlled breathing, especially box breathing (inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4), has been a game-changer for me.
   * I remember one time at work, I felt an anxiety attack creeping in. My chest was tight, my hands were shaky, and I thought I might pass out. But I sat in a quiet corner, focused on box breathing, and while it didn’t make everything disappear, it gave me enough space to think clearly again. Sometimes, that little pause is all you need.
2. **Grounding Yourself in the Now**
   * Anxiety loves dragging us into the “what-ifs” of the future or the cringe-worthy memories of the past. My brain is especially good at replaying awkward things I said years ago, usually right when I’m trying to fall asleep.
   * That’s where grounding exercises come in. My favorite? The 5-4-3-2-1 technique:

* **5 things you can see** (the clock on the wall, the book on your desk).
* **4 things you can touch** (your shirt, the warmth of a coffee mug).
* **3 things you can hear** (birds outside, distant traffic, your own breath).
* **2 things you can smell** (or imagine smelling, like cookies or lavender).
* **1 thing you can taste** (even if it’s just the toothpaste you used earlier).

It sounds simple, but it’s helped me calm down during long flights, nerve-wracking meetings, and late-night spirals. It reminds me that, in this moment, I’m safe.

1. **Write It All Down (Messy Is Fine)**
   * My brain can feel like a crowded train station—noisy, chaotic, and overwhelming. Brain-dumping has been my go-to way to quiet the noise. I grab a notebook and write down every thought, worry, or random idea. There’s no structure, no right or wrong—just getting it out of my head and onto the page.
   * I started doing this before bed, and it’s been a game-changer. When my thoughts are on paper, I don’t feel like I have to keep holding onto them. Bonus: it’s helped me fall asleep faster because I’m not stuck in an endless loop of overthinking.

**(P.S.** For anyone interested in guided journaling or cbt therapy to clarify emotions and thoughts, I’ve been using this app called **LePal** lately - my friend who works at Google recommended this gamified one. It’s simple, supportive, and surprisingly fun—I even have a little digital pet that cheers me on (she replies to every journal entry you write and gives you super useful insights lol). Highly recommend checking it out if you’re into low-pressure tools like that.)

Anxiety is messy and complicated, and there’s no quick fix. But small steps—like breathing, grounding, or writing—can make a world of difference. I hope one of these tips helps. And if you’ve got something that works for you, I’d love to hear it.

1gyxpzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gyxpzf/new_job_and_pet_loss/,New job and pet loss,"I (24f) started a new job at the beginning of the month.  Last Monday, my dog of 12 years passed away very unexpectedly and it has been the worst pain my family and I have felt in a long time. This dog was also my sisters soul dog/best friend, and she was already not super mentally stable before this, so to say that hasn’t added to the stress, I’d be lying. Like to the point where she’s saying she’d rather not live on anymore, so I’ve been trying to be as present with her as I can to support her.

New job is hybrid with a 4 in/1 WFH day schedule, and it’s a 2 hour commute each way (that alone has been more than miserable). I had been unemployed for a year, so I needed to accept this as it was the first offer I had gotten and a 20k pay increase from my last. My job previous to this was my first out of college, fully remote, was there for a year, and I am now longing for that job again because this new job and commute is miserable beyond belief. Everything about it is miserable except for the coffee machine they have there. I’ve been crying almost daily this whole month, at my desk and in the bathroom, and this past week has made me realize how badly I miss the flexibility of my old job. I cannot keep doing this one. 

This past week I also finagled my way into working remote for the entire week, and took a half day Monday and Tuesday off. It’s not like I was just being lazy and wanted to WFH, I have been an absolute mess and couldn’t/still cannot fathom being around people, especially strangers who don’t understand what I’m going through. I got a talk from my boss and his boss about my attendance and the importance of being present in the office on Wednesday/Thursday this week, which I do understand because it’s the company policy, yada yada, but it really just put a bad taste in my mouth because I was visibly crying on both calls while thanking them for their flexibility during this traumatic week. I still am a wreck and don’t know how I’m going to go into the office and function this upcoming week. Yes I know the distraction would be helpful for a lot of people, but I have hated this new job since day 1. I need to find something with remote flexibility for more than 1 day per week. 

Now for the actual question I want advice on: should I ask for my old job back? I am 100% willing to take the pay cut and I miss/need that kind of remote flexibility with everything going on in my life. I regret accepting this current job offer so so so much to be honest. I know anxiety and stress is expected within the first few months of a new job, but this is a whole new level that I know for a fact I cannot sustain. I ended on ok terms with my previous employer, and say “ok” because I could only do 1 week instead of 2 due to the new job I was supposed to start (that fell through the cracks and then I was unemployed lol). Is that a dumb idea? I wouldn’t quit current job until I had an offer from old one, but I could really use some advice as I have no idea what path to take right now. Thank you in advance.

But in the conversation he actually broke up with her first. She got triggered and panicked and in an attempt to please him she offered to break things off with me in order for their relationship to continue. He declined and she was a wreck for a week while I gave her space and we resumed our relationship on the basis that she said that really was not what she wanted at all and she really does want to be with me. I accepted that, but did say that when we started seeing other people again I would probably need a lot of reassurance that this sort of thing wouldn't happen again.


Things have been mostly very good since then, apart from her habit of telling me about her desires for other men that don't align with how she seems to desire me and leaves me feeling uncomfortable. Examples include, she has told me early on how I am never to grope her or grab her bum in public because she finds that repulsive. However she spent one evening talking about a man she is close friends with and how much she just wished he would just grope her sexually while they were having coffee together. She has talked a lot about how she has had such lovely experiences giving oral to other men over the years, but with me it's different and she just wants to go straight to sex. This is after I asked if we could include more foreplay in the bedroom. And then the most recent thing was she was telling me how this man is really annoying her and pestering her for sex since he heard she is poly and he thinks that means she must be easy. She completely surprised me by asking if I would be ok with her starting a Dom/sub relationship with him so that she could punish him, even in the same sentence telling me how she doesn't even want to have sex with him. I expressed my confusion at this proposition and said it didn't sound like a healthy way to deal with the situation and she came to the realisation that she uses sex to try to regain control over men who she feels threatened by.


My issue is that after all of these events I have been left feeling not good enough, which I understand is totally a me thing really, but when I have asked or sought out reassurance she has become irritable with me and told me that is stuff for me to deal with. But to me it feels like she has more desire and willingness to please problematic men meanwhile I am safe for her to just act as she pleases. Which, in theory, I'm actually very happy about, I like that she feels safe to put her boundaries down where she feels comfortable. But emotionally I'm feeling less desirable to her than these other guys (ouch my ego) and I would just like some reassurance. Should I be just dealing with these insecurities on my own, I know the work needs to come from me but is it too much to ask for some reassurance from her?


For me poly is appealing because I think people should have full autonomy over their hearts and bodies, but the way this is playing out is hurtful for me. She is usually very warm and loving and generally our relationship is supportive and lovely, except when I am feeling insecure and express that, she becomes cold. I think this is her way of breaking away from her previous people pleasing ways. But its the opposite of what I'm looking for in those moments. Maybe I'm just being too needy",1,1732472107.0,polyamory,10,1.0,False

How do I explain to him this is hurting me?,"This feels so weird to even try to explain, but it's happening so often that I've even had friends point it out, and I would like advice on what to do. 

My bf and I have been together for 2 years, we live together and have pets etc. Lives enmeshed. In the last few weeks, bf has started responding to almost everything I do or say as though it was a very mean comment or action. Like, I will say something innocuous, and he will interpret it as a cruel jab. A recent example was that he promised to stay in bed with me in the morning for a while and snuggle or whatever. He left to use the bathroom, and I kind of dozed off waiting for him to come back. After a while, I went to look for him and he was in the kitchen saying I ""shoo-ed him away"" because I was sprawled out when he came back and couldn't get in bed. We have a king bed, and he didn't try and nudge me or anything. Another was I saw him using the whipped cream I bought for Thanksgiving, and I said ""oh we'll have to get another can for thanksgiving. I'll put that on the list tomorrow."" He recoil and asked why I was judging him so harshly for wanting whipped cream on his coffee. 

All these things have been so small that they're almost difficult to talk about because they seem minor. But it's genuinely almost everything I do or say is interpreted as a mean spirited remark. I had a friend come visit for a weekend a while ago, and she asked how our relationship was going. I said that I feel like I've been cruel lately without trying to be, and I'm trying to be more mindful about my comments. She shut me down really harshly and said that during the small amount of time she's spent with us, she had noticed him twist my meaning on almost everything I had said. Even obvious compliments.

I have tried to talk to him about it, but all the individual instances are so small that I sound a little crazy when I bring it up. It hurts my feelings to have all my actions interpreted in bad faith, especially since I'm not someone who roasts my friends or makes mean jokes. I just really want advice on how to proceed. 

How can I explain to my partner what he is doing and how it hurts my feelings without seeming ridiculous? Or am I being ridiculous?",3,1732472092.0,relationship_advice,12,1.0,False

Seems to be the weight my body always ends up if I’m not paying attention. Previously down to 200 mostly by paying attention to my diet and doing wildfit, essentially a low carb diet. Gained 55 after divorce. Thought I’d give wegovy a try to get a kickstart. 

I don’t think I eat much and mostly feel nauseated and constipated. Have added in  fiber, probiotics, anti-reflex meds, stool softeners. Mornings are usually the worst. Have to choke down my morning coffee. Probably should focus on what I eat. From a calorie stand point I don’t think I’m overeating but will admit that sometimes the only things I can eat are ritz crackers, graham crackers, oreos and some ice cream.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.
