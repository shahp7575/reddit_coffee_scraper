1ny134q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1ny134q/my_brother_haunted_us_3/,My Brother Haunted Us #3,"My brother, Billy, died in 1980 at age 12, accidental drowning. This is story #3 of his haunting antics. 

My other brother was 1 year younger than Billy, but the boys were similar in size. My mom would purchase their clothes in duplicate when things were on sale. They had identical shirts, coats, and pajamas most of the time. To keep track of the clothing items, she would write their initials on the tags. 

After his death, my mother gathered all of Billy’s belongings. She went through all the rooms and found every item with his initials on them. She donated all his clothing to the local secondhand store. In her grief, she purged everything. She then turned his bedroom into a storage room/pantry. 

A few months after the death of my brother, we had a family from my dad’s navy days stay with us for a weekend. Mom set me up in the new pantry on a roll away cot and gave my room to our guests.

The first morning I woke up and saw a pair of pajamas laid across the bed. I took them to the kitchen where everyone was sitting around enjoying their morning coffee. 

I asked my mom if she left the pajamas on the bed for me or was the plan to loan them to one of our guests. She looked at the tag, saw my deceased brother’s initials, and asked in a loud shrieking voice where I got them. I shrugged and said that they were on the bed when I got up. I thought she put them there. 

She woke up my brother and accused him of hiding them from her and pulling this prank to embarrass her in front of our guests. He had no idea what she was talking about. 

So my deceased brother, who was a prankster, left his pajamas on the bed in his old room.

And mom was big mad. ",1,1759601379.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

today at coffee we talked a lot about our boundaries and other stuff relationship related , we seem very compatible and she’s technically single . she said she’s locked in but hates the fact that she’s always locked in but never knows if the other person is because she met them on a dating app.

i’m definitely in limbo and don’t know if i’m going crazy or not - she even said she’d go to the pumpkin patch with me and do fall activities but mentions the girl sometimes but just briefly but i don’t know - i’ve thought about telling her i’m interested and would be like i would be exclusive with you if we talked so you wouldn’t have to fret . we are also in the same club and classes so we have a lot of interactions.

I'm going to a friend's place for dinner next week and I said I'd bring dessert. Friends husband is dairy/lactose Free as he gets extremely sick and also no honey/malt though I'm told his only causes minor stomach upset I still don't want to subject him to that. My husband is autistic so has specific food preferences so im seeking suggestions for a recipes  for a dessert that hits all the requirements of

- Dairy/Lactose, honey and malt  free 
- doesn't take hours to make (chill/rest time not included)
- Can be made the day before  and stored overnight as I'll be out all day and my husband will need to meet me at their house and bring the dessert with him 
- Prefer no coffee flavored desserts 
-no coconut, or citrus flavored desserts
- no hot fruit desserts like apple pie etc

I'd love to hear any suggestions even if it's not usually dairy Free but can be easily modified I'm all ears!

1ny0wxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ny0wxa/yerba_mate_energy_drinks_again/,Yerba mate energy drinks (again),"Every time I visit this forum, it’s the same issue. I’m hooked on Guayaki Yerba Mate energy drinks. I’ve been drinking them almost daily for three years. Whenever I try to quit, it’s the same pattern. The day after I skip one, I feel awful all day, so I’m tempted to drink one in the afternoon, and the nightmare restarts. If I wait two days and get a night’s sleep without drinking, I feel much better the second day, but I’m so fragile that I easily slip back. A month ago, I went nine days without because I was on a cruise ship, forced to abstain. And I felt okay, I survived… I noted a phrase that might help some. For the day to be good, you must go through a tough phase (no drinks and withdrawal). So logically, the opposite is a shitty day, choosing ease and pleasure… the sugar and great taste of these drinks. I don’t want to make a long post. But now I realize it has to be hard before it gets better. So I want to quit. I’m 39 and talk about this forum to my parents, two big coffee drinkers (I don’t drink coffee), and they say people here are hypochondriac idiots. I try to make my parents understand I desperately want to stop these drinks, it’s a cry from the heart, but they say I’m entitled to some pleasure in life, that two a day is nothing, and it’s not a drug.

1ny0un0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasonalWork/comments/1ny0un0/sitka_bazaar_got_another_job_review/,Sitka Bazaar - Got Another Job Review!,"The first job review I received on my site, [www.occupationwanderlust.com](http://www.occupationwanderlust.com) in regard to the Sitka Bazaar in Alaska was mostly positive, but this recent one I got tells of a much different experience.

""The manager at the dock store, Bobbie, is not only incredibly bad at her job, but also shockingly rude to employees, owners, other managers, and customers. The store was often a mess (i.e. containers of stock left out on the floor), and the layout of everything was disjointed in a way that meant things didn't sell as much as they could have. The role of associates is to restock items from back stock (kept at the store) or pulled from the warehouse and for associates with larger sections, it would take longer at the end of the day due to the store layout. However, she refused to let them finish their section if it required overtime, choosing instead to finish it herself (thereby granting herself the overtime hours, in addition to her already higher wages).   
  
Furthermore, she never knew what was going on. In one instance, she was unaware that a cruise ship had cancelled, despite it having cancelled four days before. She yelled at the owner of the store after this incident, claiming that he should have told her. She often spends large chunks of time talking on the phone outside of the store during working hours (and overtime hours), and once left the store to work at the neighboring store for an hour without telling anyone. She claims that she doesn’t get paid enough for what she does, but in reality, she did very little. She gets incredibly stressed out over very minor problems, so much so that associates often tried to fix things themselves when possible, rather than going to her, the manager. Another instance of Bobbie’s cluelessness was that during the sale period at the end of the season, she told each associate something different about what exactly was on sale from the knife counter/jewelry stand, and was unable to clarify upon further questioning.  
  
She did not train any of the employees beyond basic register/POS skills. More complex transactions (returns, exchanges, tax exemptions, knife counter) had to be taught by other retail associates. Learning how to do this job was largely trial-and-error, as well as observing how other employees do things. She explicitly described her dislike of training new staff, intentionally leaving it to employees even though she is the manager. Despite this, she was eager to criticize if she thought something was being done wrong. One example of this is her telling an employee they were “too slow”, totally disregarding the size of their section, as well as the fact that it was their first week. If you have never worked a retail job before, then best of luck to you.  
  
In addition to being alarmingly inept at her job, the way Bobbie speaks to others is simply unacceptable. She swears at employees, customers, and store leadership nearly constantly. She has chased multiple customers out of the store, swearing at them over things she believed were slights at her. One incident was due to a woman talking to staff too much during closing, and the other was because she claimed a man was stealing a $10 dollar lotion. The second incident was particularly unfortunate; there were several other customers in the store as she very loudly yelled at this couple (it should be noted that they were both people of color) to ""get the f\*\*\* out of my f\*\*\*\*\*\* store! . . . get off of my f\*\*\*\*\*\*\* property! . . ."". In both of these incidents, dock security should have been retrieved, and it was extremely unprofessional to make the scenes she did.   
  
She also frequently yells at employees over extremely inconsequential things. One employee got in a shouting argument with Bobbie because she believed that they were doing too much (trying to take over her job), realistically, they were trying to be helpful. Another employee was yelled at for eating a small snack during a break in the rush, because it made Bobbie look bad in front of her boss. Yet another employee was scolded for asking the assistant manager to get coffee rather than her (something that had never previously been a problem). Her mood changes violently throughout the day, and associates need to be on guard constantly so they don't accidentally become the victim of her next episode. During the days with large crowds and hectic environments, she made them a categorically worse experience than they would have been otherwise. She is an extremely volatile individual, and if you value working in a normal, stable environment, I cannot recommend working for her.  
  
Despite concerns about her being taken to the store owners several times, they refuse to do anything about it, and treat her considerably better than employees that have been working for them far longer. Several employees have expressed criticisms which have been ignored in favor of Bobbie. Employees have also expressed their desire and willingness to come back had it not been for Bobbie. The owners of this company clearly do not care about their employees or retention rates by keeping her on for next year. Under these conditions, I clearly cannot recommend working for Sitka Bazaar.""

Unlinke the warm welcome I am really pissed while writing this email , not only at apple but android, WhatsApp too ! These bunch of morons can't make a seamless app for transfer.

I am not the only one impacted by this, read the countless reddit posts, forum questions on WhatsApp and the rating s of the move to iOS app.

Background: After using an android phone all my life (Samsung S series and ultra series) , I had a impulsive though, If I am to spend so much on a Samsung, why not try using an iPhone for a bit and see all the ""Security"" and ""Smoothness"" hype people keep making. Well I had my coffee and went to grab a sage green iphone 17 with 2 years of apple care + since I keep destroying my phones on motorcycle rides !

The buying experience was the only good thing about that day, after that it went downhill fast.

Firstly who TF designs a setup process in which if you accidentally click continue on one-step and reach the next one , you cannot go back (example the WIFI setting page, the data import page). Also the wordings are confusing in certain places, after a failed import it says, do you want to continue, well if you click that it skips the import and then goes to the iCloud and apple id page. NO WAY TO TO GO BACK unless you press the power button and click start again, in which it wipes the phone and then you do all steps again taking another 30 mins to reach the same area.

I reduced my WhatsApp backup from 37gb to 9.5 after successive failures thinking maybe the size was the issue (see size does matter, at least to apple), I tried using the wireless connection (both 2.4 and 5 Ghz), I tried using a cable (both apple and a usb 3.0 one),tried using older versions of the move to iOS app, I tried WhatsApp only import too and the whole calls + data + whatsapp import but no matter what I did it would fail at 77% saying  
""AN UNKNOWN ERROR OCCURED. PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER."" !!!

the error at 77%

I have gone through every guide, every video, AI summaries and all just to fix this. Spent more than 14 straight hours, 14-16 retries and now have lost hope on carrying forward my precious WhatsApp backup

Any further help, consolation, and experiences are welcome !!",4,1759600597.0,samsunggalaxy,5,1.0,False

1ny0oyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1ny0oyb/my_mom_kept_asking_me_when_are_you_gonna_start/,My mom kept asking me 'when are you gonna start living?' until I finally understood what she meant,"So my mom has this annoying habit of calling me every Sunday and somehow the conversation always ends with her going ""honey, when are you gonna start LIVING?"" Like what does that even mean mom, I'm literally alive breathing and everything.

Been getting this question for probably 3 years now. Always thought she was just being dramatic because I work a lot and don't travel to Europe or whateve.

Last month I'm walking to my car after another 11 hour day and this random old guy at the bus stop just says ""beautiful sunset tonight huh?"" I looked up and honestly... I hadn't noticed. Been walking past the same sky for months and never looked up once.

That hit me weird. Started paying attention to little stuff after that. The way my coffee actually tastes when I'm not scrolling my phone. How my neighbor always waves even though I never wave back. The fact that I haven't called my best friend in like 6 months even though I think about her all the time.

Called mom today and told her I'm starting to get it. She just laughed and said ""took you long enough kiddo.""

Still figuring out what ""living"" means exactly but I waved back at my neighbor yesterday and it felt... I don't know, normal? Like how things should be?

Anyone else have someone in their life who kept telling them stuff you didn't understand until you suddenly did?",8,1759600480.0,Life,5,1.0,False
1ny0ovc,https://v.redd.it/bv3qrnahh4tf1,Radiance Trip Report: Catalina Ensenada 4 Nights Cruise. Start Date 09/29/2025. Long Beach CCL Cruise Terminal,"This was our first CCL cruise together as a couple and also our first inside cabin. We live in Los Angeles so we just Ubered over to the cruise port. They sent me emails and many texts advising me to use a ride share to get there. We were planning on doing that anyway.

Total cost of cruise including prepaid tips and insurance was 700 dollars. We stayed in room 8317. I put a room tour video and review up on YT under name of GeriatrickGames. You can also see a link to the video from Cruisedeckplans website.

Previous cruises this year alone were Cunard Queen Elizabeth 11 nights Alaska (terrible food) and RCL Ovation Of The Seas 6 Night Cabo Ensenada. (best food).

I am 66 and wifey is 55. Just FYI, my first cruise was in 1986 on Carnivals first ship made for them back in the early 1980s - the Tropicale.

As we got on the ship our first thoughts were 'this ship looks old', 'where are the team members that welcome us on board?', 'OMG the buffet is so small', 'the salad bar is pitiful', 'its so crowded'.

Rooms were available early at 1pm, so we went to room and unpacked. Normally I would just hang out on the balcony, but not this time, no balcony. We were out so much more which is a good thing. 

Went out to the main pool area for sail away party. Went up one level so I could film it. I didn't know what to expect. Music was already playing loud before the actual sail away party. People were drinking and having a good time. Kids in the pool already and a total good vibe. It was at this point that my attitude changed. I was up there dancing and it felt so comfortable. The mix of people is so LA and I just felt at home. They played my kind of music. You know, disco'ish that ANYONE can dance to. So much better than that stuffy Cunard ship with it's ballroom dancing music and guests who obviously have been taking ballroom dancing lessons for 30 years.

FOOD: As with any cruise, food will be a ratio of hits or misses. The goal for me is to find things I like and stick with that. I realize that on a cruise you won't be able to control things like you can at home. I tried almost everything except Pig And Anchor. OH BTW, I DO NOT go to specialty dining that has a cost. I am old school and the only thing I would pay extra for is alcohol, but even that, I didnt spend a penny. You can bring one bottle of wine per person in your carry on and I just needed one bottle for this trip. I am a huge coffee fiend and only drink some wine late at night. Speaking of coffee, they had coffee stations all over the place with jugs of milk and creamer. Cunard ran out of creamer after 3 days. Never going on Cunard again!

The thing I like about CCL is that they provide many options for food instead of the buffet being the only game in town during the day. As stated, the buffet is quite small and limited but the food was good until the last night. YIKES! On the last night I suggest going to the MDR if you can. Oh BTW, deck 9 is laid out with a nice flow from back pool to mid pool and all these food options an easy walk. Only issue is that it is very narrow in places, but everyone was polite about it.

Pro tip: For lunch you can go into the buffet and then upstairs to the specialty restaurant called Capistrano. Its is free and you fill out a card for how you want your pasta. They pick up the card and bring the food back to your table. It was so good. I can't believe this was free. I made my own small salad at the buffet and brought it upstairs as well.

ENTERTAINMENT: The cruise director did a good job keep the party going, whether it be at the pool, theatre or the Radiance lounge. The theatre had one night with the main show called Rock Revolution focusing on 1969. The place was half empty, I couldn't believe it. They have these bench seats you can use and some are very close to the stage. The show was great considering the ship and short cruise. Best song was Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds because of the animations. They even did Whole Lotta Love by Zep, and the guitar player was playing live.

Besides that, the best thing to do on a cruise is to entertain yourself and this cruise certainly sets the stage for that!

PORTS: We did not book any tours. We already did Best Of Ensenada on Ovation. Next time we go to Catalina we will do the parasailing.

GYM: Very nice gym and hardly anyone used it. I had it all to myself it seemed. Good machines and free weights too.

OVERALL: By day 3, my wife shocked me. She said, 'you know I am really having a good time on this cruise!'. I said 'of course!'. We are not young but we are very active and are young at heart. For the price, this is a great little get away and lots of fun. I would not want to take this ship on a long cruise so it is doing exactly what it should be doing. Going off season in late Sep into Oct is something we might do every year. The weather was perfect. We are becoming CarnivalCruiseFans!!! BTW, 8 night Panorama coming up soon. Balcony this time. LOL

I probably left out a bunch of stuff here, but this review is getting long and I did it on the fly.  

Thanks for reading!

today at coffee we talked a lot about our boundaries and other stuff relationship related , we seem very compatible and she’s technically single . she said she’s locked in but hates the fact that she’s always locked in but never knows if the other person is because she met them on a dating app.  

i’m definitely in limbo and don’t know if i’m going crazy or not - she even said she’d go to the pumpkin patch with me and do fall activities but mentions the girl sometimes but just briefly but i don’t know - i’ve thought about telling her i’m interested and would be like i would be exclusive with you if we talked so you wouldn’t have to fret . we are also in the same club and classes so we have a lot of interactions.

I'm usually also interested in Fanatical slots. When it comes to games from previous Humble/Fanatical bundles, I've picked up almost all the ones I'm interested in from the last few years, but some I'm still looking for are:

The Hero Quest / Traveler's Refrain / BeatSlayer*

I prefer to trade bundled games for bundled, and unbundled for unbundled. If you're offering bundled games for my unbundled ones, I won't expect 2x gg value like resellers, but it will still have to be a pretty damn good offer ;)

Only trading for Steam games (not interested in GOG/EA). May be interested in PayPal/TF2 trades, but not crypto.

https://preview.redd.it/1mi2pt6xt4tf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d037ed955dbd71fbc11c238569a6d53ec2216caf

Whenever a supplement gains traction online, the first thing people search for is reviews. The second thing they search for is complaints. That’s exactly what happened when I started looking into Mitolyn. I wanted to know if the glowing testimonials were balanced by real criticism, or if there were red flags hidden behind the marketing.

To give you the clearest picture possible, I pulled together what I’ve found from Mitolyn reviews and complaints across forums, consumer blogs, and discussion threads. Here’s everything in one place so you can decide for yourself whether this supplement is worth trying.

**>>** [**TRY MITOLYN WITH MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE AND 45% OFF NOW!**](https://bestoffertoday.co/new/mitolyn)

**The Promise Behind Mitolyn**

Mitolyn markets itself as a metabolism support supplement. Instead of promising extreme fat burning with stimulants, it claims to work at the cellular level by boosting mitochondria — the tiny energy producers in every cell. The pitch is that by “reawakening” sluggish mitochondria, your metabolism becomes more efficient, which can translate into gradual fat loss, more energy, and better overall health.

This unique angle is what got people curious. But as with any product, what really matters are the user reviews and complaints.

# The Positive Side of Mitolyn Reviews

From the hundreds of Mitolyn reviews I’ve read, a few consistent benefits show up over and over:

# 1. Steady Weight Loss

Many users report losing between 8–20 pounds over a 2–3 month period. The progress isn’t dramatic in the first weeks, but it builds steadily. For a lot of people, Mitolyn helped them get past a plateau.

# 2. Improved Energy Levels

One of the most common positive comments is about stable daily energy. Users say they no longer hit the mid-afternoon crash and feel more motivated to stay active.

# 3. Better Digestion and Less Bloating

Multiple reviews mention smoother digestion and reduced bloating. Some believe this is due to berberine in the formula, which is known to support gut health and blood sugar regulation.

# 4. No Harsh Stimulants

Unlike many fat burners, Mitolyn doesn’t rely on heavy caffeine. This means no jitters, no racing heartbeat, and no sudden crash.

**User Review (Positive):**  
*“I gave it 90 days before making a judgment. I’m down 15 pounds, my stomach isn’t bloated like before, and I don’t rely on coffee to get through the afternoon anymore. Worth it.”*

# The Negative Side: Mitolyn Complaints

To be balanced, here are the most common Mitolyn complaints I’ve seen across different platforms:

# 1. Slow Shipping

This came up often in user feedback. Some people reported waiting two to three weeks for their order. Others said their bottles arrived in about a week, so experiences vary.

# 2. Customer Service Delays

Several users said they had trouble getting a quick response from customer support, especially when asking about refunds. While refunds were eventually processed for some, the wait was a frustration.

# 3. Price Point

Mitolyn isn’t cheap. A single bottle can feel expensive if you’re comparing it to basic green tea extract or berberine bought separately. Some reviewers felt the price was only justified if they saw clear results.

# 4. Slow to Show Results

The most common complaint was impatience. A lot of people expect weight loss pills to show visible changes within the first two weeks. Many who stopped early said they saw “nothing,” while those who stuck with it longer reported gradual progress.

**User Complaint:**  
*“I took Mitolyn for three weeks and saw zero difference. For the price, I expected more. Maybe it works if you wait longer, but I wasn’t willing to keep spending.”*

# Mixed Mitolyn Reviews

Some users posted reviews that were both positive and negative, depending on how you look at it. These are worth paying attention to because they show realistic middle-ground experiences.

* *“It took a full month before I noticed anything. At first, I was frustrated, but then I lost 10 pounds over the next two months. Shipping was slow though.”*
* *“Too pricey for me, but I can’t deny I feel less tired in the afternoons. Haven’t lost much weight, maybe 4 pounds in two months.”*
* *“Customer service is a nightmare, but the supplement itself does help my cravings.”*

# Consumer Reports on Mitolyn - Summary

If I had to distill all the Mitolyn reviews and complaints into a clear picture, it would look like this:

* **About 60% positive:** Users saw steady weight loss, better energy, and less bloating.
* **About 25% neutral:** People who didn’t notice much change but also didn’t report side effects.
* **About 15% negative:** Complaints about shipping, price, or lack of quick results.

This ratio isn’t unusual for supplements. Very few products have universal praise.

# Pros and Cons

Here’s a quick breakdown based on real user feedback:

**Pros**

* Steady, realistic weight loss when used consistently
* Increased energy without caffeine jitters
* Supports digestion and reduces bloating
* Backed by recognizable ingredients

**Cons**

* Not cheap compared to single-ingredient alternatives
* Requires patience (at least 30–60 days to notice results)
* Shipping and customer service aren’t always smooth
* Doesn’t work equally well for everyone

# Who Should Consider Mitolyn

From what I’ve gathered, Mitolyn seems best for:

* Adults over 30 dealing with slow metabolism
* People who exercise and eat relatively well but can’t lose stubborn fat
* Anyone wanting more daily energy without stimulants
* People looking for digestive and blood sugar support as a bonus

It’s less likely to satisfy:

* People who expect instant results
* Those on a tight budget
* Anyone unwilling to give it 2–3 months of consistent use

# Final Thoughts: Mitolyn Reviews and Complaints

When you put everything together, Mitolyn reviews and complaints paint a balanced picture. It’s not a miracle solution, but it’s not an empty product either. For many users, it delivers steady weight loss, improved energy, and better digestion. For others, the price, customer service, or slow results overshadow the benefits.

**>>** [**TRY MITOLYN WITH MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE AND 45% OFF NOW!**](https://bestoffertoday.co/new/mitolyn)

The truth is, supplements like this work best for some bodies and not for others. If you’re patient, consistent, and realistic, Mitolyn may help you move past a plateau. If you expect rapid results or flawless service, you might walk away disappointed.

At the end of the day, the reviews and complaints show that Mitolyn is neither perfect nor useless — it’s a tool that works for many when used correctly.",1,1759600183.0,customer_testimonial,0,1.0,False

If it would help, her Starbucks go-to is a venti Iced White Chocolate Mocha (No Whip, Sub-soy since shes lactose intolerant). I try to limit her coffee to twice a day but she would go for more if she could.

The [coffee brand,](http://foxbusiness.com/category/food-drinks) owned by Kraft Heinz, will temporarily be renamed ""Maxwell Apartment,"" a move it said it made ""to meet the needs of today's consumer.""

""In a time where value matters now more than ever, Americans seek value in areas of their everyday, including where they live,"" Kraft Heinz said in a press release.

[**THAT LATTE OR CAPPUCCINO COULD GET MORE EXPENSIVE AS COFFEE PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/latte-cappuccino-could-get-more-expensive-coffee-prices-continue-rise)

Nearly one-third of Americans chose to rent their homes versus purchasing, according to data from the Census Bureau. The median asking rent in the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was just more than $1,700, according to [Realtor.com data.](https://www.realtor.com/research/august-2025-rent)

""Two-thirds of American adults drink coffee every day, which can add up quickly, especially these days,"" said Holly Ramsden, Head of Coffee, North America at Kraft Heinz.

The brand is offering a 12-month ""lease"" on coffee, which it says is designed to keep java lovers stocked with a year's worth of coffee.

Fans can get four 27.5-ounce canisters of Maxwell House Original Roast Ground Coffee for $39.99. One 27.5-ounce canister costs $12.99 on Amazon.

The deal comes as Americans are paying more for their coffee as prices for the caffeinated commodity are near record levels due to global production headwinds and higher costs from imported coffee exposed to tariffs.

The most recent edition of the consumer price index (CPI) released by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/government-and-institutions) showed that coffee prices were up 20.9% from a year ago in August and rose 3.6% on a monthly basis.

I’ve been invited to barely any social plans last month and have had folks cancel on me when I’ve initiated plans or just not even say anything. haven’t had success reaching out to people —- some heard me out and did ask to get together, but I felt like it was a pity invite. 

Quite a few of the friends I’ve talked to have been consistently going out and doing things, and I’ve been openly saying that I’d love to hear about it next time and come along, but no dice. I’d hear later that they did the thing anyway. It just makes me feel really unheard and ignored. I constantly feel like I’m chasing people down and pulling teeth to get them to hang out. I feel like people don’t respect my time or energy. 

Because of this, I’ve had some old toxic mindsets start to rear their ugly heads again and it’s been killing me. To go fully mask off for a minute (vent post and all): *inhale* I hate being friends with popular people because they’re always surrounded by friends and I have virtually none and I’m jealous and tired of being treated like a nobody to people in my life! I just want to have a tribe and have people who mutually support one another and seek each other out! I’m tired of always being the one to extend the branch and have it just be snapped like a twig while they’re all laughing with their real friends. I’m sick of hearing “oh sorry I’m booked for the next few weeks I’ve had a ton of social plans” and I’m like “must be fucking nice to be invited to things!” I’ve never been popular in my freaking LIFE and I can’t even imagine what it’s like to be soooo loved that you flat out can’t fit a one hour coffee date into your *busy* calendar. Never, ever once in my life have I had that experience. It makes me feel fucking inadequate, like I’m just some loser that they’re going to *sigh* have to accompany for a moment because there’s nothing better to do, then tell me “oh I have to get going” and it turns out it was some fucking party. I’m tired of finally getting a moment to hang out with someone and all they wanna talk about is their new best friend, what they’re doing with their new best friend, what their new best friend likes with his toast — good god, what am I, chopped dick? For fuck’s sake I give so much for people and drive hours out to go see them and bake people gifts and listen to their worries in return I get “sorry I can’t make it” over and over and over and FUUUCK it makes me just want to isolate and never talk to anyone ever again.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ohio State vs. Minnesota: A David-and-Goliath Spectacle with a Side of Sarcasm**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a football match that’s as lopsided as a pancake at a waffle convention. The No. 1-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes (4-0) host the Minnesota Golden Gophers (3-1) in a Big Ten clash where the odds are about as balanced as a tightrope walker on a windy day. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a stand-up economist.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Ohio State’s Implied Probability Feels Like a Math Class

The betting lines make this as clear as a neon sign in a blackout: Ohio State is a **-23.5-point favorite** with moneyline odds hovering around **1.02 to 1.04** (implied probability: **95-96%**). Minnesota, the underdog, sits at **+12.5 to +14.0**, translating to a **6.6% to 7.1%** chance to win. For context, this is like betting on a turtle to beat Usain Bolt in a sprint—*unless the turtle has a jetpack, which it doesn’t*.

The total line is **42.5 points**, with nearly even money on Over/Under. Given Ohio State’s explosive offense (led by QB Julian Sayin, who’s as accurate as a GPS) and Minnesota’s mid-tier defense (230 yards allowed per game), the Over seems tempting. But let’s not forget: Minnesota’s defense is second in the Big Ten against the run. If Ohio State’s ground game struggles, we might see a low-scoring affair.

### News Digest: Injuries, QBs, and the Tragic Tale of Darius Taylor

Ohio State’s path to dominance? It’s paved with Minnesota’s misfortunes.

* **QB Drake Lindsey** had a stellar 324-yard, 3-TD performance against Rutgers, but his receivers are a mixed bag. Star transfer Javon Tracy is the team’s only reliable target, which is like asking a single lightbulb to power a city.
* **Running back Darius Taylor** is questionable, which would force third-stringer Fame Ijeboi into the spotlight. Ijeboi averaged 4.9 YPC last game but managed just 37 yards on 12 carries. Imagine asking a toddler to carry a backpack full of bricks—*it’s possible, but not pretty*.
* Minnesota’s defense, while strong against the run, faces a QB (Sayin) who’s as accurate as a coffee machine in a college dorm. Ohio State’s offense averages 40+ points per game, so unless Minnesota’s defense starts playing chess with the ball carrier, this could be

Years ago an old friend showed me a series, I completely forgot the name of it but the general gist was there is an intergalactic war, and humans are seen as a huge threat although they aren't the main belligerents (i think) 

A specific scene was there was an alien diplomat or commander on board a human ship for the first time, and he learns what coffee is, and he's sort of stunned that humans just openly take stimulants and nobody cares.  
At the end of the first episode, the humans blew up a fleet or something, and it's a big thing.

1nxzwu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Parking_Tiger_9703/comments/1nxzwu7/retirement_is_not_all_that_its_cracked_up_to_be/,Retirement is not all that its cracked up to be,"Anya had spent thirty-five years setting her alarm for 6:00 AM sharp. Thirty-five years of the same chirp-chirp-chirp, followed by the hiss of the espresso machine, the clatter of the train, and the relentless, demanding rhythm of the law firm. She longed for the day she could smash that alarm clock, trade her tailored suits for soft cotton, and let the sun dictate her schedule, not a spreadsheet.

That day, as it always does, arrived.

The Endless Saturday
The first month of retirement was, in a word, blissful. Anya felt like a teenager on a grand summer holiday. She slept until eight, then nine, then gloried in the sheer decadence of reading a book—a real, physical, non-legal-textbook book—on her sun-drenched patio at eleven in the morning. She took a spontaneous trip to the coast, ate fish and chips by the sea, and barely checked her phone. This, she thought, was the life she'd earned. This was the promised land of leisure.

Then, the calendar flipped to the start of the second month. The novelty, as sparkling and fresh as a new tin of paint, began to flake away.

She woke one Tuesday morning at her usual 6:00 AM, a reflex honed over three decades. She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the familiar surge of panic—the thought of a missed deadline, a forgotten meeting. It didn't come. There was nothing. Just the quiet hum of the refrigerator.

She got up, made her coffee, and sat on the patio. By 7:30 AM, she'd finished the newspaper, which usually took her an interrupted forty-five minutes on the train. By 9:00 AM, she'd watered the basil, checked her emails (nothing), and dusted the living room (unnecessarily).

The silence was the worst part. At the office, the silence meant something important was happening behind a closed door. Here, the silence just meant nothing was happening at all.

The Weight of Freedom
The sheer, staggering, boundless freedom felt less like a gift and more like a heavy, shapeless blanket. She looked around her immaculately tidy house, her beautiful garden, and a faint, unsettling anxiety began to thrum beneath her breastbone.

""What am I supposed to do?"" she muttered to her reflection, which looked surprisingly energetic for a person with no pressing agenda.

She'd scoffed at her former colleagues who'd rushed into new hobbies—golf, because, well, that's what retirees did; painting, because it was ""creative."" But now, those pursuits seemed like lifelines.

She bought a set of beginner's acrylics. The first canvas was a disaster. She painted a vibrant blue sky that looked suspiciously like a bruise. The second was a still life of a pear that ended up looking more like a lopsided avocado. It wasn't the joyful, meditative experience she'd imagined. It was frustrating, lonely, and she missed the immediate, tangible reward of winning a complicated case.

She considered signing up for golf lessons, but the thought of spending four hours chasing a tiny white ball across a meticulously manicured lawn felt like just another job, one she'd have to pay to do.

Her husband, an engineer who had retired five years earlier, was perfectly happy. He spent his days tinkering in the garage, building small, intricate wooden ships. He had a focus, a project, a world he could step into and out of.

""Why don't you try volunteering?"" he suggested, looking up from gluing a miniature mast.

""Volunteering where?"" she snapped, instantly regretting the harsh tone. ""Where they need a former corporate lawyer to argue with people over property lines? I'm trying to escape that, Henry!""

""No,"" he said gently. ""Somewhere new. Where they need an intelligent, capable person. A literacy program. A historical society.""

Anya stared out the window at the empty sky. She realized the biggest shock of retirement wasn't the loss of a paycheck, but the loss of identity. For thirty-five years, she was defined by her profession, her schedule, her competence under pressure. Now, she was just Anya, a woman with nowhere to be, no one depending on her, and an infinite expanse of unstructured time.

Retirement wasn't the unending holiday promised in the brochures. It was a vast, empty canvas, and she was terrified of the blank space. It wasn't about finally doing what she wanted; it was about the sudden, sharp realization that she had absolutely no idea what that was. The work had stopped, yes, but the purpose, she now understood, had stopped with it.

What do you think Anya's first, non-law-related purpose-driven activity should be? Something that uses her keen legal mind without being a law firm.",1,1759598658.0,u_Parking_Tiger_9703,0,1.0,False

OXO failing.,"I am a nano-roaster and sell my coffees. I also have been using an OXO 8 cup brewer for the past 3 years as a daily brewer for home but also to taste test my coffees as many of my customers do. And yes I do pour overs and French Press as well as espresso. But the OXO is failing me now and I'm on the search for my next batch drip brewer.  I'm finding the OXO is letting me down, often not wetting the entire bed and leaving dry grounds, as well as somehow bypassing in the basket to a degree and dripping water while brewing. The shower screen is fine and I suspect it's the design and way the shower head mates up to the silicon spout that feeds it. In any case, I started noticing the weak tasting coffee and seeing the dry grounds in the basket and started testing my TDS from a batch. 

I'm using 65-66g to a full pot, 1200g of water. If I just let it brew without some manual intervention to stir the grounds I'm getting less than 1% TDS! Like 0.8 to 0.9. If I stop the brew process and stir, or remove the carafe for a bit so I get more immersion I can get the TDS into the 1.4 range and things taste good again. 

So I'm looking at replacing the OXO soon, but I'm interested in some real world results from users of drip brewers like the Moccamaster, Breville Precision, Aiden etc.. But I'm really interested in measurements, because taste and body are subjective. I'm looking for nerds here that have a refractometer and can measure their results of a full pot of coffee (after stirring of course) assuming you don't have a Moccamaster or similar carafe. 

I know Moccamaster is well regarded and tried and true, but I still see the shower head missing a lot of the grounds during the initial brew stage from videos I've seen, so I'm curious how a full brew actually turns out. What does the final bed look like? I have no idea on the Aiden or others. And TDS measurements help tell the final tale. 

If you bother to take a measurement and reply to this post, I'd appreciate info on the brewer, how long you've had it and which refractometer you're using. I'm using a DiFluid which has been very valuable in helping dial in brews and grind settings etc.. 

TIA for anyone who bothers to reply with good info and I appreciate my fellow coffee nerds who have a refractometer in their toolkit. ",1,1759598209.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

I’ve been feeling quite itchy for at least a week but pain is tolerable, just annoying. 

Yesterday, I noticed my right breast is swelling up and the t junction is red with a little scabbing. I text my surgeons nurse a photo and she said to keep an eye on it, add ABD pads for extra compression and she’ll put me on the schedule for Monday.

I’m panicking a little. I’m my “3rd week” and I feel like I’m doing worse than my first week and 2nd week was definitely more bothersome but chalked it up to numbness going away. I will admit I’ve been rolling along in my regular activities whilst still “taking it easy” but reaching above my head probably more than I should. I have four young kids so life can’t stop and I do my best to rest when I can. 

Each post op appt, my surgeon takes off my steri strips and puts new ones on so I don’t see any of the incisions other than the t junction. 

I’m stressed, anxious, and annoyed that I don’t feel like pain/itching is improving. I’m only taking Celebrex at night and Tylenol here and there when I feel it’s necessary. Surgeon sort of made a comment that patients are usually feeling better at this point so I’m concerned. I have no fever but I do feel “chills” at times. There seems to be no extra warmth on my breasts but the incision areas do feel like a burning sensation while also feeling itchy. I change my ABD pads daily and shower every other day.

Is this more emotional pain bc I feel so worried? The swelling is the only thing that is so off putting bc it was looking so much better on Thursday. 

On a side note, my last pregnancy, I was very anxious and my OB told me I was calling the nurse line too much. This has made me feel apprehensive and uncomfortable about reaching out to medical professionals in general and being put in a “hypochondriac” sort of category but obviously I did text the nurse Friday afternoon (yesterday) to share about the swelling.

Looking for 2-3wpo symptoms hoping this is all in line with the healing process so I’m not freaking out until Monday. I just started adding collagen powder to my coffee and a daily women’s multivitamin. I already prioritize protein and good nutrition, no alcohol since August and I’ve never smoked (although maybe a bit heavy on the sweets lately).

So, let’s talk about feeling a bit... stiff lately. You know that feeling when you try to bend down to pick something up and it feels like a mini wrestling match with your own body? 😅 Trust me, you’re not alone! It happens to the best of us, especially after 50. But guess what? Just a few small changes can make a **huge impact** on your mobility. 

Here’s what I’ve found:

- **Start Small**: You don’t need to jump into an intense workout or yoga class right away. Just stretching for a few minutes a day can work wonders! **Feel like your legs might disown you?** Try gently stretching them while sitting on the couch. Instant relief! 

- **Stay Consistent**: Find a time that works for you. Could be while your favorite show is on or during that coffee break. Little things add up over days, weeks, and before you know it, you’ll feel like a new person. 

- **Explore Movements**: Incorporate simple movements into your day-to-day stuff. When you’re brushing your teeth, try standing on one leg. Ever brushed your teeth like a flamingo? 😂 It’s fun and works your balance too!

- **Find an Enjoyable Activity**: Dancing in your living room, gardening, or even just going for a nice walk—make it about having fun instead of ‘working out.’ You’ll forget you’re moving your body! 🎶🌱

- **Hydration is Key**: This one might seem like a no-brainer, but staying hydrated will help keep those joints happy. More water = less stiffness! Who knew we could combat it with a little water jug? 

- **Prioritize Rest**: This part is essential. Remember that **you can’t pour from an empty cup.** Make sure you’re getting enough sleep and time to unwind. 😊

It will be things like him repeat touching something we ask him to keep hands off of (not going back minutes later but just looking at us and doing it again and laughing). Things like that.

We don't have any issues with tantrums or aggression from him or anything. Overall, besides this, he's pretty well behaved but it cannot be an option for us to tell him something 10 times in a row and him blatantly defy us. Sometimes it's ""little stuff"" we don't want him touching and sometimes it's because it will literally break, like happened recently in a store.

I try to not introduce issues- like I'm not putting a hot cup of coffee in front of him and saying ""KEEP HANDS OFF!"" but some things are just life and we cannot remove all obstacles.  
We try not saying ""dont"" and ""cant"" and say things like ""keep hands off of that, it will break"" ""if we touch that it will break so keep hands in pocket' etc etc. I am always happy to explain why. I never just say ""because I said so"" but it doesn't even get to that before he's doing it again.

Anyone have any tips here? He speaks very well, he knows exactly what we are telling him. It's just him seeming to not listen at all and it's so aggravating.

Ever feel like you're just running on a hamster wheel? You're busy all day, but at the end of it, you don't feel like you've actually moved forward. It's like your wheels are spinning, but you're not getting anywhere. That's been me for a while now.

Lately, I've been ditching the idea of a massive life overhaul and focusing on **tiny, almost laughably simple changes**. It's not about becoming a productivity robot; it's about making small tweaks that bring back some control and, honestly, some happiness.

Here are a few things that have been a game-changer for me:

*   **The ""Win the Morning"" Rule.** I don't mean waking up at 4 AM to run a marathon. For me, it's just this: **I don't look at my phone for the first 15 minutes of the day.** I just make coffee, sit, and breathe. It stops the chaos of the outside world from being the very first thing that enters my brain.
*   **Identify Your ""One Thing.""** Instead of a monster to-do list that makes you want to crawl back into bed, I just ask: ""What is the **one single thing** that if I get it done today, the day will feel like a success?"" I focus on that first. Everything else is a bonus.
*   **The 5-Minute Reset.** When I feel overwhelmed or my focus is shot, I set a timer for 5 minutes. I can either tidy up my immediate workspace or just sit and do nothing. It’s a forced pattern interrupt that stops a downward spiral. It’s amazing what just five minutes can do.

Of course, a lot of this is an emotional game, right? It's hard to be productive when you're feeling stuck or just *blah*. Dealing with the mental side of things is often the biggest hurdle to actually optimizing anything. For anyone who feels like the emotional weight is the real roadblock, I found a really solid, structured way to get clarity with **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**. It genuinely helped me map out the 'why' behind my feelings, which made taking action so much easier.

It's all just about small, kind-to-yourself adjustments. Little hinges swing big doors.

So, what about you all? **What's one tiny hack you swear by that brings you more productivity or joy in your day-to-day?**",1,1759597490.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1nxzets,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechGadgetsAndGear/comments/1nxzets/i_didnt_realize_how_easily_i_could_lose/,I didn’t realize how easily I could lose everything until I tried iTagPro,"Last month I had one of those heart-stopping moments. I was at the airport, juggling coffee, my phone, and my backpack. By the time I got to the gate, the backpack wasn’t on my shoulder. For a solid minute, I thought it was gone forever. That experience is what pushed me to finally try a **itagpro gps tracker**, because honestly, the idea of losing my stuff had become too real.

**The fear of losing valuables**  
It’s crazy how fast panic sets in when you can’t find something important. Luggage at an airport, a laptop bag at a café, even your car in a crowded lot. The scariest part isn’t just the inconvenience, it’s the possibility of theft. Reading through **itagpro reviews**, I saw stories from people who used it to catch a misplaced bag before it disappeared completely. That’s what sold me on testing it myself.

**How iTagPro changes the equation**  
Once paired with my phone, the tracker gave me real-time updates on where my bag was. The geofencing feature shocked me the most. You set a safe zone, and the second your item moves outside it, you get an alert. I tested it at home by attaching it to my daughter’s backpack. When she left for school, my phone buzzed instantly. That level of awareness made me realize how this isn’t just about finding lost items — it’s about preventing them from being lost in the first place.

**Answering the big question: is iTagPro legit?**  
I had doubts before. So many trackers promise peace of mind but fail when you actually need them. After a few weeks, I can say it’s held up well. The Bluetooth connection is strong indoors, and the GPS makes it useful outdoors. The **itagpro range** isn’t infinite, but the app records the last location, which helped me recover my car in a massive parking lot.

**Unexpected ways I used it**  
The obvious uses are keys, wallets, and luggage, but I also clipped one onto my dog’s collar. Knowing I can open the app and check where he is makes me feel a little less paranoid during late-night walks. I even left one in my toolbox at a job site, which gave me reassurance since tools “walk away” sometimes.

**Why it stands out**  
The thing that makes this tracker feel different is how it handles prevention. Most trackers help you search after you’ve already lost something. iTagPro gives you that early warning before things go south. That’s what makes it worth considering.

If you want to see the details, here’s the link: [**iTagPro GPS Tracker**](https://itagpro.lovable.app/)

**Final thought**  
Losing things is stressful, but losing them to theft is terrifying. iTagPro isn’t perfect, but it’s the first tracker I’ve used that made me feel like I had some control back. For me, that peace of mind is the real value.",1,1759597471.0,TechGadgetsAndGear,0,1.0,False

1nxzczw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nxzczw/zerno_z1_or_lagom_p80_2000/,Zerno Z1 or Lagom P80 [<$2000],"I find myself in the enviable and privileged predicament of having to decide between two rather luxurious coffee grinder purchases for a first time espresso setup. 

After much deliberation I placed an order for a Z1 with SSP Multi Purpose burrs a couple of weeks ago , with delivery expected around mid-december. I thought I was done with grinder research at that point.

Then, I was approximately yesterday years old when I learned that Lagom will be launching their p80 next week, with delivery expected in Late October. The price appears to be nearly identical to that of the Z1 before shipping, which is tbd I guess..  

The primary appeal of the p20 for me would be (presumed) quieter operation, which I think my family would really appreciate.. plus just getting it sooner ..  but the higher end feature set (80mm blind burrs, purge mode, 500w brushless motor, sweet knocker, adjustable RPM) in a potentially smaller footprint are obviously intriguing as well, particularly at the same price as the z1.  I know 80mm burrs don't magically make better coffee, which is what I ultimately care about most.. (my wife almost certainly cares most about the quietest operation, and maybe counter space footprint).. and I'm confident that both will deliver a new level of coffee enjoyment since they will both enable me to dive into the world of home espresso (currently a long time aeropress drinker).

Cancelling the Z1 has a modest cost associated, which I can manage, but sadly there is no way to test both without eating the substantially higher cost of resale, which I cannot.. (not to mention having to explain the purchase of not one but two very expensive coffee grinders).  In an ideal world, I'd be happy with the order I've already placed.. and I'm sure I will be, but waiting until december to start learning and experimenting with home espresso brewing feels long right now ... but I also know that will stop mattering entirely once I have my setup, in the not to distant future, relatively speaking. 

I'm assuming the lagom will offer the same easy-peasy out-of-the-box ""hyper-alignment"" of the Zerno, because at these prices I have absolutely no interest in troubleshooting alignment issues, even if/when I decide to venture into alternate burrs.. I'll have enough to learn as it is just getting started with home espresso brewing without having to manage the variable of grinder alignment.  If I could magically know that one would give me a better cup, my decision would be made, but my gut says both will deliver an extremely high quality of grind that will be unimpeachable in the cup.. so I guess the question becomes how much quieter the p80 is, and, to a lesser degree, how much sooner will I receive it .. and is revisiting this deliberation even worth the effort (or the $50-60 cost of cancellation). 

Hoping you fine folks can either talk me off the ledge, or over it.

I am hoping to slowly get accustomed to the speciality coffee scene. For context, i have only ever drank the instant coffee. Recently,I have ordered  a mokapot and FrenchPress. While i wait for the delivery, I wanted to know what coffee should i try with it. It you can  recommend some sort of sampler pack for grind coffee.

I checked and found sleepyowl has a sampler pack, but i have tried thier instant coffee which didn't click for me.

Any other suggestions, recommendations are welcome too.

Thanks",1,1759597313.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False
1nxzc6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nxzc6d/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_cheated_on_him_as_a/,AITA for telling my husband I cheated on him as a TikTok prank?,"I told my husband I cheated on him as a prank and he walked out of my life without saying a single word.

It was supposed to be funny. I saw this TikTok trend where girlfriends pretend to confess cheating and film their boyfriend's reactions. It looked harmless. Everyone was laughing in the comments. I thought my husband would get mad for two seconds, realize I was joking, and we'd laugh about it later.

We'd been married for six years. Together for nine. He was the kind of man who brought me coffee every morning without asking. Who remembered every small thing I mentioned wanting. Who worked two jobs when I lost mine so I wouldn't stress about bills.

But I got bored. Not with him exactly. Just with the routine. The same conversations. The same everything. I wanted something exciting to happen.

So I set up my phone on the bookshelf. Hit record. Waited for him to come home from work.

He walked in tired like always. Kissed my forehead. Asked about my day.

I took a breath and said, ""I need to tell you something. I've been seeing someone else.""

His face didn't change right away. He just stared at me. Then he put down his work bag very slowly and asked, ""What did you say?""

""I've been cheating on you,"" I said. ""For three months.""

The look on his face. God, I should have stopped right there. His eyes went completely blank. Like someone had turned off a light inside him.

""Who?"" he asked. His voice was so quiet.

That's when I realized this wasn't funny anymore. ""Baby, I'm kidding. It's a prank. See?"" I pointed at the phone. ""It's just a joke.""

He looked at the phone. Then back at me. And he didn't say anything.

""Come on,"" I said. ""Don't be mad. It was just for fun. Everyone's doing these videos.""

He walked past me to our bedroom. I followed him trying to explain. Trying to laugh it off. But he started packing a bag.

""What are you doing?"" I asked.

He still didn't speak. Just folded his clothes. Grabbed his toiletries. Unplugged his phone charger.

""This is crazy,"" I said. ""It was a joke. A stupid prank. Why are you acting like this actually happened?""

He zipped up the bag. Looked at me for the first time since I'd said it. ""You wanted to hurt me for entertainment,"" he said. ""That tells me everything I need to know.""

""I didn't want to hurt you,"" I said. ""I just thought—""

""You thought it would be funny to make me believe the person I love most betrayed me,"" he said. ""You thought watching me break would be content for strangers online.""

Then he left. I called after him but he got in his car and drove away.

I figured he needed space. That he'd cool off and come back. But he didn't answer my calls. Didn't respond to texts. I went to his sister's house where I thought he might be staying and she slammed the door in my face.

Three days later a lawyer called me. Divorce papers.

I panicked and called my mom. Told her what happened. She asked if I actually cheated and I said no, it was just a prank. She went silent for a long time. Then she said, ""You did what?""

""It was a joke,"" I said. ""He's overreacting.""

""You're a selfish idiot,"" my mom said. ""That man gave you everything and you tortured him for likes on the internet?""

My dad called me that night. Called me a disgrace. Said I inherited my grandmother's cruel streak. My brother sent a single text that said, ""You deserve to be alone.""

My best friend since high school stopped responding to my messages. I found out later my husband had told her what happened and she took his side. Said she always knew I didn't appreciate him.

The divorce went through fast. He didn't want anything. Didn't fight me on any of it. Just wanted out. I tried to talk to him at the courthouse but his lawyer blocked me. The last time I saw him he looked right through me like I was invisible.

Turns out we had more joint finances than I realized. The apartment was in both our names but he'd been paying most of the rent. My car payment, he'd been covering that too without telling me. When he cut me off financially I couldn't afford anything. Had to move back in with my parents.

My mom barely speaks to me. Makes passive aggressive comments about how I threw away a good man. My dad hasn't said a word to me in two months. Family dinners are silent torture. My aunt uninvited me from Thanksgiving. Said my cousin's husband didn't feel comfortable around me after what I did.

I see my ex-husband sometimes around town. He looks different. Happier somehow. I heard through mutual friends he's dating someone new. A teacher. Everyone says she's wonderful. That he seems lighter now.

Meanwhile I'm 32, living in my childhood bedroom, working part-time at a grocery store because no one will hire me full-time. I deleted all my social media because the video leaked somehow and thousands of people called me evil. My inbox was full of strangers telling me I'm a terrible person.

At night I lie awake replaying that moment. The look on his face when I said I cheated. How something died in his eyes right then. I'd give anything to take it back. To rewind and never make that video. To have just appreciated what I had.

But I can't. And he's gone. And everyone I know thinks I'm garbage. And they're probably right.

I destroyed the only man who ever truly loved me because I wanted five minutes of attention on the internet. And now I have nothing.

Did I really deserve to lose everything over one stupid mistake?

January 2025, kakagaling ko lang sa hospital, waiting to take my meds, so nag-OmeTV ako just to kill time. Puro bagets at bastos na nakakausap ko… until him.

First time ko nakausap ng matinong tao dun, ang daldal, daming tanong, hanggang 2 hours na pala kami nag-uusap. Baka daw madisconnect kaya hiningi socials ko. Ayun, binigay ko dump IG haha, pero ang bilis niya mag-follow at na-stalk niya agad na dump lang ‘yon. Kinulit pa ako na i-accept siya sa main account, pero dedma ako. 😅

The next day, he asked me out for dinner & coffee. Pumayag ako. From then on, halos araw-araw na niya akong niyayayang lumabas. Grabe yung effort, sipag mag-drive, never napagod, never nagkulang. Valentine’s Day pa lang, tinanong na niya if pwede na siyang manligaw. I said yes.

Honestly, mahirap for me kasi nauuna trauma ko. Pero he never gave up. Araw-araw niyang pinaparamdam na genuine siya. Hanggang sa pinakilala ko na siya sa friends & workmates ko. And nung birthday ni Mama, sinama ko siya and pinakilala sa buong family ko. Mama even cried when she met him kasi alam niyang seryoso ako this time. 🥺

Dati akala ko normal lang yung bare minimum. Akala ko love was about giving everything kahit ang kapalit konti lang. I loved too much that I convinced myself na sapat na yun.

Pero ngayon, iba pala. Yung inaalagaan ka, minamahal ka, binibigyan ka ng buong puso, kahit hindi ka humihingi, sobrang overwhelming. Dun ko lang narealize na mali pala yung definition ko ng love noon.

Totoong pagmamahal hindi pinipilit. Hindi ka pinaparamdam na kulang ka. It’s freely given, wholehearted, and it makes you feel safe, valued, and cherished.

And today, after 9 months of courtship… I finally said Yes. 💖 our (33F & 28M) Single era ends today.

1nxz87p,https://i.redd.it/fjos0220l4tf1.jpeg,Pietro Pro + Kalita Mino! (bonus mineral water and brew recipes),"High effort post for the AI mods :)

Let's start with water. I get DI (deionized) water from the fill station at Whole Foods in gallon jars. I use this to make a mineral concentrate too.

Concentrate recipe:

400 ml of DI water. All minerals except baking soda are Pure brand from Amazon.

5g epsom salt

1.5g calcium chloride

2g magnesium chloride

2g potassium bicarbonate

1g sodium bicarbonate (Arm & Hammer brand, but any baking soda should do)

Weigh out the minerals on a scale that has at least 0.1g resolution. Warm up the DI water in your kettle to about 100 degrees F. Add the minerals to a clean jar. Pour the 400 ml of warm DI water over the minerals and stir with a glass rod (I've heard you shouldn't use silverware for this, but do your own research). Stir until minerals are fully dissolved and concentrate is fully degassed. Put the concentrate in the fridge. When ready to use, shake the concentrate well and add 12-13 ml of concentrate to a gallon of DI water. This should get you into the range of 50-60 ppm general hardness for coffee brewing. You can confirm with a simple TDS meter.

Currently brewing Diego Bermudez Golden Hour from Native Coffee Co.

20g of Golden Hour ground at 8 on the Pietro Pro.

330g of water at 198 F.

Dripper is a Kalita Mino (I choose the Mino because it has larger holes than the original or Tsubame wave drippers). Standard Kalita wave filter.

Rinse the filter with 50-60g of hot water before adding the grounds. Dump the rinse water. Add the grounds. Shake the Kalita a little to flatten out the bed.

0:00 bloom to 60g by 0:15

0:30 heavy pour through Melodrip to 120g

0:45 heavy pour through Melodrip to 180g

1:00 heavy pour through Melodrip to 250g

1:20 heavy pour through Melodrip to 330g

Finish drawdown by about 2:20.

---

Jessica was a lowly assistant at the secret corporate R&D facility. She was the person that got all the tasks nobody else wanted to do pushed onto her. She once dreamed of becoming a lead bio-engineer, with her own team, and with all the money and prestige that come with it. Those dreams were long dead, crushed by the years and years of soulless corporate grind.

Now she found herself staring blankly at the rack of opaque glass canisters, all with a big red X, marking them for disposal. She had no idea what was inside the canisters, only that it was a part of some fancy bio-engineering project Dr. Kurikara was leading. Something about rapid body modification or something. 

It was long past her work day, and this mess wasn't even supposed to be her responsibility but everyone knew that Jess was a pushover that couldn't say no, so she was left to deal with it after everyone already went home.

She took off her glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose, fatigue setting in. Not even the coffee was helping anymore. She didn't even notice herself leaning until she lost her balance completely. She tried to steady herself by holding onto the rack of canisters that were marked for disposal, but she only managed to topple the rack, causing the canisters to fall to the floor. One of them cracked open, the internal pressure causing it to violently explode, sending shrapnel flying towards her and throwing her against the wall.

As she lay slumped against the floor, she looked down at her body, only to see a large gaping hole where her heart once was. The chain of events was like something out of a really fucked up dark comedy, she thought to herself as she bled out. Shock addling her mind.

Out of the broken shell of the canister, something crawled out. It looked like a grotesque lump of flesh, slightly larger than a fist, with one eye in the middle locked right onto her. She couldn't do anything but watch as it slowly crawled up her leg, leaving a disgusting slimy trail after itself.

As it crawled onto her chest, she felt something that like needles on her skin before she heard a voice inside her head. *""We CaN SaVe EaCh OtHeR. AcCepT mE.""* Jessica's dying mind, too far gone to be able to process the bizarre situation, could only reply with. ""Who are you?"" The strange creature's eye darted around frantically before seeing the big red mark on the remains of the canister it crawled out of. ""I'm X. AcCePt Me."" The voice spoke in her mind again.

With her last breath she replied, ""I accept."" before falling over as whatever strength she had left her body. As it got the answer it wanted, the creature crawled into the cavity that used to house Jessica's heart.

A loud scream erupted from her throat. She wasn't dead anymore, but the overwhelming pain, like molten metal flowing through her veins, made her wish she was. The pain spread from her chest through her whole body, out to the tips of her fingers and toes. It only lasted a minute.

As the pain subsided, the two became one.

Thanks for reading. That was an example of the kind of scenario I would like to roleplay. 

Originally, the idea was intended to be used for a short story. A character gets killed but survives thanks to a parasite that lets them alter their body, and they have to struggle with losing more and more of their original body, in order to become strong enough to enact revenge upon their killer.

I modified that original version to fit more with the roleplaying format. I'm not married to the details and I'll happily workshop with you a different version of the scenario that would fit your preferences. I'm also open to playing either of the roles.

If that idea interests you, or if you have any thoughts, then I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

I prefer roleplaying via Discord, if possible.

October is always a good month for crypto and you can probs make money investing in majority of things rn, but you will make the most money by investing in projects that will perform well whether its October or not. Now is the time to get in though, up 70% already and things are just gonna heat up more and more and more, imo and this is NFA Kendu will not be below 100 million market cap by the end of this month. I couldn't tell you how high we will go because it's impossible and would just be a guess. Things move very very quickly in crypto and you are about to find out if you are brand new. For example Shib 1000x in 36 days, going from 22 million to 22 billion market cap. You could have literally turned $1000 into $1,000,000 in just over a month...

Kendu rn is arguably the best small cap to invest in, a lot of signs point to in terms of 2021 price action, Kendu being the next Shiba Inu or the next Doge. From Kendu being number 1 on Capitoday, to Kendu having the strongest Reddit and Stocktwits presence with a very strong X presence, Kendu is really setting new levels to what a community can achieve.

I took this as a soft no and was ready to move on, but she still texted me. We texted back and forth for 3 weeks after that, and I said to myself why not ask her out again. So I asked her out and got an answer I wasn't expecting. She said she had seen someone else and just couldn't meet me, but she really wanted too. I said that I understand and was ready to move on. It sucked because this girl is a 10/10 with a 10/10 personality, but ok. 

Then some days after that text, a situation I thought only happened in movies occurred. We walk past each other and make eye contact, and then after we passed i looked back and she also looked back and we gave each other a smile and walked away. I fell in love right there. 

I then hit her up the same day and just asked her out for a coffee. She couldn't that day. I said then I'm free the whole week if you're interested. She said yes would love that. So I asked when she was avaliable. Then the switch flipped. 

She said, ""she was still seeing this other guy, so she couldn't and everything was difficult and she was sorry, and so on."" I said ""fair no problem"" and she said ""thanks for understanding"". That was the last text interaction ww have had.

I remember having one when I was a kid who blew a blood cell in his eyes bc he got very mad at a coffee pot reflection.,0,1759596765.0,bettafish,4,0.2,False
1nxz3lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/furnaces/comments/1nxz3lg/you_know_why_the_yankees_always_win_because_the/,"“You know why the Yankees always win? because the other teams can’t stop staring at those damn pinstripes,”","He sits at a desk in the motel room, the lamp buzzing faintly above him. The laptop’s fan hums steadily.

On the screen: shipments, container IDs, delivery logs. His name reads **Frank Taylor** — a steady, legitimate-looking identity that pays enough for motels, meals, and the occasional indulgence.

A ping from the system alerts him to a message:

> [Supervisor: Carl Hensley]
“Taylor, did you check East Dock transfers? Numbers aren’t lining up.”

He types quickly. “Lagged network upload. Already fixing.”
The reply comes almost instantly:

> “Alright. Keep me posted.”

Most of his numbers are fake. Not all of them although. That helps conceal the lies. So far he hasn't been caught. He's safe,  this work keeps him afloat.

He scrolls through the logs, checking every column. The monotony is excruciating, but I suits him. One mistake can unravel everything. But he's careful enough.

A knock on the door interrupts him. A delivery from the motel’s kitchen: two sandwiches, barely warm. He pays, signs, and nods. A small interaction — the kind that reminds him people exist outside the numbers.

He sips his coffee and watches the street below. Vans make their rounds, a few pedestrians mive between buildings. Everything runs fine. It's boring but it's safe and stable.

Yet even as he types, he glances at a check on the desk, untouched. The temptation is always there — an itch beneath the surface. He knows he shouldn't do it, yet the thought of bending the rules. Just a little, Isa constant hum in the back of his mind

By midday, he’s checked, double-checked, and filed every report for the morning shift. Emails come and go. Small administrative notes, internal memos, nothing threatening. He responds politely, accurately. Invisible. Safe.

And yet, when he leans back in the chair, letting his hands rest on the worn edges of the desk, he realizes that “safe” isn’t enough. He’s alive, yes — but he isn’t living.

The afternoon stretches, quiet and methodical. He thinks about the motel from the night before, about the people he brushed past, about the small risks he took just to feel a spark. He shakes his head, almost laughing at himself.

For now, he focuses on the logs, on Taylor'ss identity, on making sure nothing draws attention. He is careful, precise, and competent.

But when the last report is filed and the laptop is closed, he leans back in the chair again and stares at the check. Waiting.
He knows it won’t stay there for long.

1nxz0hb,https://i.redd.it/n7flpm1tj4tf1.jpeg,When Truth Appears Between Sips of Beer,"It was one of those accidental evenings that becomes permanent in memory, not because anything grand happened, but because something *true* did.

I was sitting in a folding IKEA chair (the kind that never lets you forget you’re sitting in it) in front of a small art gallery tucked between a café that made surprisingly bad coffee and a record shop that hadn’t updated its window display since the Clinton administration.

My friend, a glassblower with working hands and eyes glazed from years in front of a kiln, leaned back in his own chair, one foot hooked behind the other like a man who has known too much and carries it lightly. I had my camera on my lap, the strap looped around my wrist as if to remind me of who I was when words failed me.

We were talking about photography. Or rather, I was talking, in the way artists do when they are trying to explain their compulsions to someone who already understands them but is generous enough to listen anyway. I told him I loved photographing people. Not things. And he tilted his head like he was waiting for the real reason to show itself. So I tried again.

When I photograph people, I said, I’m not capturing how they *look*. I’m searching for the quiet truth of the soul buried under that edifice that we all have learned to show the world. A moment when the curtain falls and what’s left is something unguarded. I try to catch that.

It’s not always visible. Sometimes it’s hiding behind a wrinkle or a glance or a half-smile. But when I do find it, it feels like truth. Not truth like facts on paper, but the kind that only the soul recognizes. The photograph becomes a conversation between their essence and mine. Two souls, not just one.

But things, I said. Things have no soul. A chair, a spoon, a brick wall; when I photograph those, there’s only me. It becomes a mirror. The image says more about me than about the object. It’s all my projection. With people, it’s both of us in the frame. There’s communion. A third thing is born.

He nodded, took a sip of his beer, and said nothing for a while. The silence wasn’t empty. It was loaded, like a bow drawn back but not yet released. Then he told me a story. He had been to an Apache tracking school, somewhere out west. Dirt and sagebrush country. Long days and longer silences. He said they taught you to track by feeling. Not just seeing marks in the dirt, but sensing the presence that had passed through. Reading the land like breath on glass. One of the old teachers had told him, *Everything leaves something behind. Because everything is alive.* Trees, rocks, even the wind. There is soul in all of it. It’s just our sense of self that blinds us to it.

And I sat there, somewhere between astonishment and recollection, because there it was. That moment. The kind that made me feel like I was in a lost chapter from *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*, or maybe having a conversation with Socrates disguised as a guy with nicotine-stained fingers. A man who had blown glass into sacred shapes and maybe, knowingly or unknowingly, had blown some of himself into every one of them.

It was a moment of pure clarity, where all the theories and distractions fell away. There was no gallery. No beer. No folding chairs. Just a sense of something unshakable at the center of everything. A kind of bedrock truth. The kind you don’t argue with. The kind that sits behind your eyes and waits for you to notice it.

Truth, I remembered, isn’t something you learn. It’s something you *recognize*. And the recognition usually comes in these quiet, ordinary places; on sidewalks, in workshops, at the edge of someone else’s cigarette smoke. It’s not complicated. It’s just covered up most of the time. By ego. By noise. By all the things we mistake for meaning.

We have to peel those layers back. Whether through art, or long walks, or tinkering with an engine until it purrs again. Each of us needs a practice, a way of excavating. Because if we never arrive at that core experience, if we never touch what truth actually *feels* like, then everything else we build is floating. Untethered. At risk of being blown away.

Art is one doorway. So is craftsmanship. So is silence.

The photograph, it turns out, is never just of a thing or a person. It is of a moment in which soul met soul, or at least, where one became still enough to glimpse the other. And if that moment is real, then everything else, for just a second, can be too.

1nxyxdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1nxyxdn/personal_finance_101_rule_1_discretionary_income/,Personal Finance 101- Rule #1: Discretionary Income,"It's not lost on me that many (most?) of the members here on TIC are just starting their money journey. In fact, I'd love to hear from more of our members about where you're at on that journey. Please consider leaving a comment about that and what type of posts/articles would help you most.

For decades now, I've been doing my best to help those just getting started to navigate the sometimes choppy money waters to reach a greater level of financial freedom. Unfortunately, because the topic of money is so often a taboo topic, it isn't talked about enough. In most cases, I just have to guess as to what topics most would benefit from.

Sometimes it's best to start with those topics that, to me, have the most impact and serve as a ""square one"" approach to greater financial freedom. To that end, I want to double-down on my favorite concept of ""Discretionary Income.""

**Discretionary Income Equation**

Regardless of age, net worth, or investments, there's not a person with a pulse that shouldn't be hyper-aware of their discretionary income equation. 

On the road to understanding this topic, there are three checkpoints I want you to understand:

1. Net Income - Every after-tax dollar that comes into your possession
2. Fixed Expense(s) - Those expenses that are absolutely necessary to live (rent, food, utilities, gas, etc)
3. Total Expense - All expenses including #2. This includes fixed expense + eating out, entertainment, travel, etc.

It has always been amazing to me how many can't tell me exactly how many dollars come into their possession each month. This amount is paramount toward understanding your financial potential. Even the most rudimentary of budgets in Excel, or even written down on a notepad, can help you understand your own situation. This is the start your Income Statement.

You must treat ever dollar that comes into your possession as gold. As you earn money, any number of individuals, activities, expenses and services are clawing at that dollar, trying to reduce the amount you get to keep. This is why you will hear me constantly talking about the ""money mindset"" in starting your financial journey. Keep those dollars (income) close and do not relinquish control of it unless you absolutely understand why you are giving it away and what you are getting in return. 

After you understand every dollar of income, you then reduce it by the fixed expenses needed to live your life. Life is expensive and some of your hard earned income must be allocated to living your life. Look at fixed income as your non-negotiable expenses that *must* be spent. In the beginning, this number does not include things like your coffee habit, Friday night hangouts with friends, streaming services, weekend sports betting, etc. Fixed expenses are those non-negotiable living expenses you cannot do without.

We've now reduced your income by the amount of fixed expense, leaving you with a more discretionary amount of income. Many experts will say this amount is the most important and, while I do mostly agree, your life does need to possess some level of discretionary spending that yields enjoyment. The key is understanding just how much of this *elective* spending you are engaging in and making sure it doesn't run away. Think of your discretionary/elective spending with this single question:

*If you lost all income, what expenses could be eliminated?* 

The answer to this question yields what your true fixed expense is and how much elective spending you are engaged in. Because I do believe quality of life does require some elective spending, I don't suggest eliminating it, but, you must understand where it is going and how much it costs. 

After reducing your income by fixed expense, and total expense (inc. elective spending), you are left with your ""Discretionary Income."" This amount equates to your level of ""opportunity"" when considering how to better your financial situation.

**Discretionary Income Opportunity**

This entire topic assumes that you are already taking full advantage of employee sponsored plans such as the 401(k). You should be contributing as much as you can to these programs, at least up to the employer match amount. Free money is always good money.

With your discretionary money figure now understood and top of mind, you have opportunities to consider. This is where many fail on the money journey. Discretionary income is often allocated to further elective spending, thus, reducing the opportunity to better your financial situation. Your mission, if you choose to accept is to allocate as much of your discretionary income to investment activities as possible.

My recommendation for allocation is as follows:

1. Establish an emergency fund (in the early phases of your journey)
2. Establish and contribute to a Roth IRA
3. Establish and contribute to a discount brokerage investment account

Some will argue that the emergency account is no longer necessary and could be a portion of #3 (investment account) but, at least in the early part of your journey, but I disagree. When first beginning your journey, you have a lot of new activities and discipline to learn. Having unencumbered money on the side to address misfortune is very important. But, as your investment account grows in size, you may then elect to allocate your emergency fund to the investment account instead for greater growth. The key is to ensure that you do establish an amount that can be tapped should circumstances present themselves. Each person's amount will be different.

The Roth IRA is a powerful investment/retirement vehicle. As the money is ultimately tax free, contributing up to the maximum allowable each year should be a priority. Once allocated, the account can be invested to a desired level. I like to invest with a bit more of a risk-on profile in my Roth due to its tax advantaged nature. Keep growing your Roth IRA contributions to the maximum allowable.

As for #3, I believe it's imperative to open your investment account with a discount brokerage (Schwab, etc.) as soon as possible and begin contributing to it via an automatic monthly transfer. Even if it is only $10 or $25 per month, get into the habit of this automatic investment plan (AIP). As your income scenario changes for the better, you gradually increase this monthly amount. The AIP is one of the best money hacks you will employ.

The key to all of this is maximizing your discretionary income opportunities. Ensuring that lifestyle creep doesn't keep exhausting your discretionary income via elective spending and, instead, allowing some of the discretionary income to be allocated to the three items above. 

If you remain focused on this new mindset, you'll be surprised and excited to see just how fast your net worth (including your 401(k) and Roth IRAs, will grow.

**Debt Servicing**

I want to touch on this subject only briefly because it does fold into the discussion of discretionary income opportunity.

Debt servicing, the amount that becomes a fixed expense due to loans such as autos and, especially, credit cards and personal loans, is a great threat to your discretionary income. Avoid debt servicing at all cost. Yes, it's likely you will need an auto loan to secure transportation, but don't fall into the trap of credit card and/or personal loans to fund your lifestyle. These loans are very difficult to eliminate once established and eat discretionary income for lunch.

Your money mindset should be to pay cash whenever possible and keep elective spending top of mind. If you don't have the cash for the purchase, don't purchase.

**Final Word**

There are a lot of individual variables in the equation of discretionary income and the principles at play are not always easy to see, adopt or perfect. Much like a workout or weight loss journey, a money journey takes focus and discipline. You have to want it badly enough to prioritize the habits.

Nothing here is overly complex but it will take focus and commitment. Once you develop the mindset, and you see the results, it becomes addicting and begins ushering in second-nature habits that only increases the trajectory of your net worth.

If you have any questions, please be sure to ask. I'd love to hear where you are on this journey, how you are doing with it and the successes and struggles you've experienced.

1nxyslo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxyslo,🎃Pumpkin Bread Recipe Specifically for 2QT ECI Oven🎃,"Hi everyone!! I’ve been working on my baking recently and noticed there aren’t a ton of recipes specifically for ECI so I thought I’d start experimenting on making my own. 

I didn’t grow up with “real” seasons so I’m OBSESSED with fall and one of my favorite things ever is pumpkin bread but when you get it from coffee shops it’s often too sweet, too dry, or too mushy, like I always end up kinda underwhelmed. Sooooo I’m super excited to share my pumpkin bread recipe with everyone, it’s super simple, is not too sweet, has a good crunch factor and was made specifically made for a 2QT ECI oven! 


Pumpkin Bread in 2QT Pumpkin Cocotte:
Bake Temp: 350°F (175°C), no lid
Bake Time: 55–65 minutes 

Dry Mix
	•	1 ½ cups of flour
	•	1 tsp baking soda
	•	½ tsp baking powder
	•	½ tsp salt
	•	1 ½ tsp ground cinnamon
	•	½ tsp ground nutmeg
	•	½ tsp ground allspice
	•	½ cup white sugar
	•	½ cup packed dark brown sugar

Wet Mix
	•	½ cup canola oil 
	•	2 large eggs
	•	1 cup solid-pack pumpkin purée (a little over 1 cup is fine)
	•	2 tsp vanilla extract
	•	2 Tbsp milk 

Toppings & Mix-ins
	•	I took about a handful of pumpkin seeds and folded them into the batter and used them used the rest on the top to create a “crust”.
	•	1 egg for the egg wash 
	•	1–2 Tbsp sanding sugar for sparkle and crunch! 


1.	Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Butter up your Dutch oven and preheat! (I was pretty generous with it.
	2.	Make the wet mix: In a medium bowl, whisk oil, eggs, pumpkin, vanilla, and milk until smooth and glossy. Make the Dry mix.
	3.	Combine: Pour wet mix into the dry bowl. Fold gently with a spatula until just combined — batter should be thick and slightly lumpy. Do not overmix.
	4.	Add seeds: Fold in a handful of pumpkin seeds. Pour batter into prepared cocotte and smooth the top.
	5.	Finish the top: Place pumpkin seeds flat and evenly over the surface, brush lightly with beaten egg then scatter sanding sugar on top. (I did the egg wash on top of the seeds to glue them down and make them more crust like and so they sugar would coat them).
	6.	Bake uncovered for 55–65 minutes. Start checking at 45 minutes:
	•	Done when the edges pull slightly from the sides, the top looks set and a little bouncy. 
	7.	Cool: Let bread rest in the cocotte! 

 Note: Served it in the pumpkin because it’s so cute so I didn’t try removing it from the oven itself like I do with my banana nut breads.

Thank you all for letting me share, please let me know if you guys have any questions or feedback. If anyone ends up making it I’d looooove to know your take! ❤️

- also doesn’t have to be very heat resistant. I’ve never been one to put hot pots, pans, or trays on my counters so that’s not particularly an issue. As long as I can use my air fryer and crockpot, it’s good enough for me. 
- non porous. This is a coffee and wine household.
- would love low or no maintenance.
- doesn’t have to be indestructible but obviously accidents happen. I’m not swinging heavy shit around my kitchen recklessly though. 


I love the look of quartz but it misses a lot in these categories it seems. I’m not well versed in other materials, but things like soapstone obviously aren’t super light. 

Budget isn’t an issue. The piece I need now is only about 14 sqft and a full kitchen renovation is far on the horizon. 

Thanks in advance!

I haven’t thought too hard on it yet but the one new rule for sure that I will be setting is NO working from home at my house if you want to “help watch the baby”. I let my mom and my SIL do this with my first and it ended up driving me up a tree. They made everything harder and took what little peace I had in my house away. We lived in a small condo at time so it was just too much. I had to make them coffee, I had to sit there and listen to all their work calls and meetings (which was soo loud and irritating while I was beyond running on fumes since my little one at time didn’t sleep in more than 45 min stretches at night and I was hormonal obviously) while they worked a full non stop day with so many meetings. They only wanted to “cuddle” the baby for a few mins here and there but not help with anything else really or even wake him up from naps to show baby off on meetings or be way too loud when trying to put little one down for nap or if I wanted to try to shut my eyes too. Just way too much noise and interruptions. I’m getting irritated just thinking about it now (yay current pregnancy hormones haha) but that is definitely a rule I will be setting. Absolutely NO working from home at my house because it took away my peace and caused me more emotional issues. If you want to watch the baby you can use PTO. They might see it as mean or rude or inflexible but I did it for my first and learned it does not work for me. I had a rough transition into motherhood so I want to set myself up for better mental success this time around instead of being accommodating for others when it makes things more difficult for me.

1nxyqis,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nxyqis/whats_the_newest_portable_mug_warmer_technology/,What's the newest portable mug warmer technology?,"Hey everyone! I've been diving deep into the world of mug warmers lately, and I've got to share my recent discoveries with you all. As someone who constantly forgets about their coffee until it's ice cold, finding the perfect mug warmer has been a game-changer for me.

You know how frustrating it is when you're caught up in work, and your perfectly brewed coffee turns lukewarm? Well, I recently stumbled upon this amazing portable mug warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that's completely changed my daily routine.

The latest technology in portable mug warmers is pretty impressive. These new models come with temperature control settings, auto-shutoff features, and some even have smartphone connectivity. I'm talking about maintaining your drink at the exact temperature you prefer, whether it's coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.

What really blew my mind was the heating efficiency. The newer models use advanced heating elements that distribute heat evenly, preventing those annoying hot spots. Plus, they're super energy-efficient – most use less power than a small LED bulb.

The best part? They're actually portable now. Like, genuinely portable. Not those bulky things from a few years ago that needed to be plugged in all the time. The newest ones come with built-in batteries that last for hours. I can move from my desk to the living room without unplugging anything.

Safety features have come a long way too. Most modern mug warmers automatically shut off if they don't detect a mug for a certain period, or if they've been running for too long. No more paranoia about whether you turned it off before leaving for work!

I found this particular model (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that even has a waterproof design – perfect for clumsy people like me who occasionally spill their drinks. It's been a lifesaver during my long work-from-home sessions.

The durability is impressive too. These aren't those cheap plastic warmers that break after a few months. The new ones are built with high-grade materials that can handle daily use without wearing down.

One thing I've noticed is that these new warmers work with pretty much any type of mug – ceramic, glass, metal, you name it. Just make sure your mug has a flat bottom for the best heat transfer.

If you're like me and can't stand room-temperature coffee, or if you're tired of making multiple trips to the microwave, I'd definitely recommend checking out these new portable mug warmers. They're totally worth the investment, especially if you work from home or spend long hours at your desk.

I'm just following up on the post I made a while ago that's about Dungeons and Dragons with like-minded individuals and similar morals (to put it bluntly, not racist, pro-LGBTQ, pro-choice, free Palestine, etc. etc.).

So I was wondering if anyone else would be interested in joining to start a campaign in October or November? I had a few people reached out before, which is great! We're a group of 5-7 as of now on Discord. 

As for the Dungeon Master, I don't have any experience with being the DM. So I was wondering if anyone is interested in being the host. And I'd love to help out, learn, and collaborate. I can see how being the DM means investing tons of hours to create the characters, the game mechanics, writing the lore and plot, etc.

If this sounds fun, let me know! I'd suggest meeting for coffee/drinks first to get to know each other and talk about character ideas and stuff.",4,1759595804.0,Annapolis,0,0.84,False

1nxyo18,https://i.redd.it/7kjkwk5yg4tf1.png,Map Service API,"It all started with a notification.

A billing email from Google Cloud, with a number that looked like an international phone number: the monthly cost for using maps.

And then I felt it... that mix of frustration and defiance that only a dev knows when the system seems to be telling you ""pay or die.""



I'm a systems engineer and mobile developer (Flutter).

I've implemented hundreds of routes, searches, and maps in client apps and my own projects. But always, when I went live, the story was the same: the API charging as if each coordinate were worth gold.



Until one day, between lines of code and cold cups of coffee, I asked myself a dangerous question:



""What if I stop renting maps and start building my own?""



From there, the real journey began.

It's not a sprint, but a digital odyssey.

Networks, cybersecurity, Tiles, geoservers, coordinates that seemed to be off-axis…

I slept little, dreamed of latitudes, and every 500 error was a lost battle on the backend front.



But something changed.

Little by little, between frustrations and small triumphs, the map began to breathe.

My own server, my routes, my geocodes, everything working.

Sin Google. No absurd fees. Just knowledge, patience, and that dose of madness that every good engineer needs to challenge the system.



Today my maps API is live, stable, and running in production.

And the best part: it costs up to 85% less than Google Maps.

I use it in my projects and decided to share it with the community because I know there are other developers out there facing the same cost storm.

so ayun, i went to the ob to get consulted. we did a transvaginal ultrasound. tbh nagulat ako na ganyan pala. i wasn’t expecting na ganyan na ultrasound since it’s my first time. i didn’t told my mother about this since i don’t want to be a burden for the expenses, and kaya ko naman since i also have a part time job. so during the ultrasound, my ob told me that’s it could be possibly pcos. for a context about my body type and weight, i am severely underweight. i’m consistent 34kg not until around june this yr, i gained weight. i’m around 38.5kg now. i am 5’2. basta ayun, like petite ako. i also don’t have sports or engage in any physical activities. i didn’t think that pcos would be possible in a thin body, pero ayun. niresetahan ako ng:

1. mypcos - i bought the powder one since mas mura. 2x a day ko raw inumin for 3 months. 

2. fishoil - 1x a day after dinner

3. calvit gold - 1x a day after lunch

4. duphaston - 1x a day for 7 days. 

i was also advised to avoid coffee, milktea and sweets. 
daily exercises, kahit walking na lang. 
8-10 hours of sleep. 

on sept 26, dumating na yung regla ko. so i stopped taking the duphaston, and my period was so heavy and it went for 6 days. ngayon wala na. tapos na. 

for my second visit, i was advised to go back on oct 12-13, but maybe di ako makabalik since busy talaga and hell weeks are coming. is it okay po ba na i’ll just continue drinking the vitamins and mypcos to monitor if babalik sa regular yung period ko? 

hoping for a kind response from everyone! help your girly out! 🥺🫶🏻",1,1759595410.0,PCOSPhilippines,0,1.0,False

1nxygxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nxygxo/the_borrowed_voice/,The Borrowed Voice,"After losing my voice to Vocal Fold Paralysis I finally quit talking and started listening but what I heard was terrifying. 

I won't bore you with all the details of losing my voice, lets just say it was a botched surgery with no real explanation. Now I'm stuck with my thoughts and no immediate way to express them, only pen and paper. 

I guess its best to start from the beginning. I have a very mundane routine I wake up at 6am, jog the same stretch of road, and go to the same coffee shop every morning. I'm a very boring and average man just trying to make ends meet. Everything was normal even after losing my voice up until the man behind the counter of Sam's Coffee, a man I've known and talked to for years spoke in my voice. My heart skipped a beat while a look of confusion slowly grew tighter on my face, I didn't say anything hoping he would speak again and I would be wrong. ""Tim, your coffee?"" My voice echoed through my ears. I grabbed my coffee giving him a look of disbelief unsure what to think or if I was just hearing it wrong. I heard laughter and whispers amongst the fellow shop goers, all of them sounding familiar but not loud enough to completely hear them. I stood outside of Sam's for what felt like forever trying to justify what I heard in attempt to feel better. I finally flagged down a taxi as the fleeting thoughts of Sam's employee left my brain then the cab driver turned around and asked ""Where you headed?"" In my fucking voice. What the hell? Was my only paralyzed thought. Surely this Indian man didn't share the voice of a middle aged white guy. I typed a message on my phone to show him that read ""Pardon me?"" I had go be sure I was hearing this right. ""Where you headed?"" This time he spoke slowly, I wasn't mistaken he definitely spoke in my voice. First the cashier at Sam's now this random taxi driver they both sounded exactly how I used to. Did I miss my voice so much I started hearing strangers speak with it? It was to much for me to wrap my head around so I got out of the cab and began walking home, I was going to call in sick today. 

Shortly after getting home I splashed some water on my face and waited for my wife to get home work and the kids to get home from school. I sat down with a plate of last spaghetti, turned the TV on and flipped through the channels until I saw a news broadcast that said ""Breaking News: Cop shot dead after routine traffic stop."" Before I could react to a cop getting killed I first had to react to the news achor that had my damn voice. I would like to say that was the most disturbing thing but what unsettled me the most was his eyes. They looked just like the guy at Sam's and the taxi driver, black as a starless night sky. Like 2 pools of venom staring into my soul, in the gaze of the news achor I perceived an abyss deeper than the gulfs between stars mesmerizing me, putting me in a trance. Then the language changed from English into some kind of gibberish with the sentences all mixed up. I turned the TV off and began to pace in my living room. I was going crazy I thought, have I gone completely insane after losing my voice. I needed to talk to someone....someone I knew couldn't have my voice....my mother. I picked my phone up and dialed Mom the line rang for a few seconds then went to voicemail, she forwarded my call and sent a text that read ""You ok?"" I told her yeah I just needed to hear her voice cause I was going through some things. Her reply was ominous to say the least ""You sure?"" I didn't know what to think, there's no way my mom could now have my voice as well. I was too much of a coward to have her call, the fear that brewed around formed a disturbing concoction of anger, sadness, and terror. If my mother spoke in my voice it would be too much to deal with. I sent back ""It's ok I'm fine now, just had an anxiety attack."" 

I sat around waiting to find out if I'm crazy or not, my wife and kids would solidify it. Its either I leave and find no answers or I stay and find out when they get home. I laid awake on my bed staring at the ceiling thinking about the guy at Sam's, the taxi driver, and the news anchor. They all had my voice but what was wrong with their eyes? They looked soulless, nobody else looked that way only the ones who spoke to me directly. What could that be? Was my last thought until I finally fell asleep. I woke up to the sweet, thick as honey voice of my wife. ""Hey, baby you ok? You didn't go in today?"" The relief I felt had to be visible. I stood up gave her a hug and kiss on the forehead. Maybe i wasn't going crazy after all, maybe I'm just dealing with the trauma in a traumatic way, which sounds crazy but it's the only thing that made sense. My son ran into the room, before he spoke my heart sank I was afraid he would sound like me but thankfully he didn't he hugged my leg and said ""I love you Daddy!"" Then ran off into the kitchen to get some afternoon snacks. As he ran out of the door I could see his older sister standing there, her eyes....her eyes looked like the deepest depths of the ocean. I jumped back and pointed at her, my wife's sincere look turned to anger as she said ""What are you doing? Whats wrong?"" I frantically searched for my phone to type out a message telling her to look at her eyes. Then she spoke my daughter a 8 year old little girl had my voice....the voice of a grown man. ""Daddy what's wrong?"" My heart began to beat its way out of me as I stared at my daughter in shock. Theres no way im hearing this right, there is no conceivable way to explain this, something is wrong with me.....or something is wrong with them. I looked down knowing I had a horrified expression on my face and walked past my wife, daughter, and son. I went directly out of the house. I was shaken to my core but something told me to turn around. My whole family stood at the doorway talking in unison using my voice ""We love you."" They must of said it 4 times before I started to run down the street. 

I ended up a bus stop, the flickering florescent light along with the cold metal bench and cloudy night didn't make me feel much better but I had to stop, I must've ran for miles letting the darkness consume me and my fear fuel me. I sat alone at the bus stop hoping no one would show up, granted it is 10:30PM so my chances of someone trying to catch a bus this late is slim to none. I had to of fallen asleep either from exhaustion or shear desperation either way I woke up to hear my voice ""Hey mister you need a ride? Its cold out here."" I turned my gaze to see a well dressed man in a pickup truck, I stared for minute then gestured my hand to my mouth letting him know I can't speak. Then he said ""I already know, I'll be using your voice."" Rage and fear sent fire through my veins making me stand up and walk around to the driver side of the truck. I ripped open his door and began to beat this man into a bloody pulp. The back of his head struck off the cement as I slammed my bloodied knuckles into his face, shattering bones. The twitching of muscle and gushing blood strangley made me feel some kind of relief, I wasn't a monster I was just scared. 

I ended up in some small town after leaving the man that took my voice to die on the street and stole his truck. I knew I only made things worse by stealing his truck and leaving him there but what was I supposed to do? Either I'm going crazy and what I did is unjustified or something is tormenting me for some type of satisfaction. 

I slept in his truck for 2 days, staying away from any living soul that sought to destroy me and take what was already wrongfully stolen from me all while trying to use it against me. It wasn't long after that before the cops found me, I knew it would come to this. You can't beat a man to death then steal his truck with no consequences, whether you believe something malevolent is after you or not. There was no point in resisting arrest, its not like I could speak my mind and tell them what happened even if i did they would call me crazy. To my surprise none of the officers used my voice nor did they have the dark clouded eyes. We drove for what I assumed to be about 30 minutes before arriving at a police station. With my hands infront of me still cuffed they allowed me to write down what happened. I gave them all of the information from losing my voice, the guy at Sam's, the taxi driver, and worst of all my daughter. After I told the detectives everything I began to feel a hint of relief like maybe this thing is over, maybe I had to kill one of them for it stop. Its been almost 3 days since anyone has shared my voice or looked at me with dark eyes and ever darker intentions. Why wouldn't there be a reason to believe I defeated it.

A light tap on the door followed by the turning of the door knob the door swung open to reveal a tall dark haired man. 

""Tim Jones?"" He asked 

In my fucking voice!

1nxyeof,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextDestination/comments/1nxyeof/unique_things_to_do_in_berlin_beyond_the/,Unique Things To Do in Berlin (Beyond the Brandenburg Gate),"**Berlin’s more than its famous landmarks** and if you’ve been there (or plan to go), you know the city has this mix of grit, creativity, and history that’s hard to describe until you’re walking through it. I spent a few weeks exploring Berlin, and I wanted to share a mix of popular spots and lesser-known gems that made my trip unforgettable.

**1. Start at the Berlin Wall but go beyond East Side Gallery**

Everyone hits East Side Gallery for the murals, but take time to visit the **Berlin Wall Memorial** on Bernauer Straße. The preserved section there shows what the border zone actually looked like. It’s haunting and powerful.

**2. Grab coffee in Kreuzberg**

Berlin’s most creative neighborhood is full of character. Try:

* **Bonanza Coffee Roasters** (great flat white, minimalist vibe)
* **Five Elephant** (try the cheesecake!) Walk along the canal after. It’s local life at its best.

**3. Experience Berlin’s music scene**

You don’t have to queue 5 hours for Berghain to enjoy the scene. Try:

* **Sisyphos** (open-air, chill vibe)
* **Klunkerkranich** (bar on a parking garage rooftop. Great sunset view)
* **Watergate** (house music with Spree River views)

**4. Dive into history. Literally, in the bunkers**

The **Berliner Unterwelten** tours take you through old air-raid shelters and Cold War bunkers beneath the city. It’s eerie but incredibly insightful.

**5. Explore the alternative art scene in RAW Gelände**

This old train depot turned cultural space is covered in graffiti, with pop-up markets, bars, and climbing walls. It’s raw Berlin energy. Messy, loud, and fun.

**6. Relax in Tempelhofer Feld**

Where else can you **bike down a runway**? The former airport is now a massive park where Berliners picnic, rollerblade, and fly kites. Bring snacks and join the locals.

**7. Browse flea markets on Sunday**

Berliners take their flea markets seriously. My favorites:

* **Mauerpark** (touristy but fun. Live music too)
* **Boxhagener Platz** (more local, good vintage finds)

**8. Try craft beer (not just Pilsner)**

Berlin’s beer scene has evolved. Check out:

* **BRLO Brwhouse** (beautiful setup near Gleisdreieck Park)
* **Heidenpeters** (inside Markthalle Neun)
* **Vagabund Brauerei** (tiny, local microbrewery)

**9. Escape the city for a day**

Take the S-Bahn to **Potsdam.** Palaces, lakes, and gardens that feel like another world. Rent a bike and explore Sanssouci Palace grounds.

**10. Sunset at the Victory Column or Teufelsberg**

Climb the **Victory Column** for 360° city views. Or, if you’re into abandoned places, hike up **Teufelsberg**, an old spy station turned street art museum. Sunsets there are unreal.

**Takeaway**

Berlin’s magic is in the contrast. History and creativity, structure and chaos, all mixed together. Whether you’re into art, food, music, or just wandering aimlessly, there’s always another layer to uncover.

I go into more detail (with photos and a few hidden spots I didn’t list here) on my blog:

1nxyei9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nxyei9/the_tusks_of_greif/,The Tusks of Greif,"Its been 3 weeks since my wife went missing in the Colville Forest of Washington. The search party got called off 2 days ago, now I'm stuck doing it on my own. 

Locals say something lurks in the canopy of the woods searching for what it lost long ago. A soul turned sour by grief, flesh twisted by rage. They call it the The Tusks of Greif. I've heard these legends my whole life and always chalked it up to being an urban legend, mystery turned to myth. 

Copper City the old mining town was the last place Sarah was publicly seen. It's about an hour drive from our hometown Tacoma. She frequently came up here to hike the trails and sight see, she always said she could find peace in the wilderness. I wasn't as tuned to nature as Sarah I always wrapped up in work, regrettably so. Maybe if I would of went with her this time none of this would of happened. 

The authorities said she got lost and most likely died from the elements but I couldn't believe that. She was an experienced hiker she had been doing it for over a decade and never got lost once. I'm going back tomorrow and I won't leave the forest until I find her. 

The silver curtain of rain pinged off the roof of my car as I held the picture of Sarah. ""I wish we hadn't argued, I'm sorry honey."" The town of Copper City was run down with half collapsed abandoned buildings and even worse homes. It had one gas station at the edge of town, that's where I'll start. The store smelt of pine needles and burnt coffee with one old man that had wrinkles in his face older than the trees outside. I slid the picture of Sarah that was still warm from clutching it to the old man and asked ""You seen this woman?"" 

In a thick rural accent he replied ""Nope I ain't seen that one."" He could see the disappointment on my face then followed up with ""Any chance she went up the Deadwood Trail?"" 

My voice was so low I was surprised he could hear it ""I'm not real sure."" I replied. 

""Well that's where most of em go missing."" He said with a slight undertone of regret. It made me think that maybe he wished he hadn't told me that. 

""Thanks."" I told him and turned to the door then he spoke again. 

""Listen mister if you go out to them woods you best mind yourself cause there's something out there."" 

I cut him off ""Yeah ive heard all about The Tusks of Grief if you want to sit here and tell me urban legends then just point me to someone who can actually help."" 

His old narled finger raised gesturing to a house across the street. ""Thanks again"" I said sarcastically. 

The house across the street struggled everyday in a battle against gravity before its inevitable collapse. A woman about the age of Sarah sat on the porch before I could even ask a question she yelled out 

""Daddy, come here!"" 

An old man with gray hair, and a large scar that ran from his temple to his chin stepped out. 

""What can I help ya with?"" His voice sounded like gravel in barrel. 

I raised the picture of my wife up to show him. ""Have you seen this woman by chance?"" 

His worn out hand reached out for it, he rubbed his chin and stared for minute. ""No I don't think I've seen her. Why? He asked. 

""She's my wife, she went missing a couple weeks back I need to find her."" I told him as I grabbed her picture. 
""Well I wouldn't go out on your own now ya hear. Theres something out in the woods.""

Anger rose to my throat ""Does everyone in this fucking town have something to say about The Tusks of Grief?"" 

He rubbed the scar on the side of his face and said ""I didn't get this for no reason. My wife went missing 5 years ago and I never found her."" 

""What happened?"" I asked 

""A man cursed with grief and forever stuck to roam the forest trying to find what he lost, found me instead."" His voice flat and stoic leaving no room for emotion. 

""What did he lose?"" I replied 

""His family well I should say its family. And I found out why the women that go missing never return and why the men that dissappear are found ripped apart and half eaten......I guess im just one of the lucky ones."" You could hear the sorrow in his voice. 
 
I couldn't find the words to say so I simply said ""Thanks, I'm sorry for your misfortune."" And began walking back to my car but as I left he yelled out one more thing. 

""Let your anger guide you but be sure to leave grief at the edge of the forest.....greif makes it hungry."" 

I started to question the legend. Maybe it was real after all? Or maybe these people are just insane hillbillies. I drove through Copper City aimlessly not knowing my next move then I seen it through the pattering rain, a sign. Most the letters peeling and faded from wheather but I could make out enough to read it. Deadwood Trail 5 miles. I pulled the car over and stared at the sign while sorrow filled my heart. I couldn't help but to think about The Tusks of Grief if it was real what could of happened to my wife. Was she taken by this man? Or did she just get lost? That's when I remembered a gun shop down the road from the gas station if I was gonna go down Deadwood Trail it would be better if I was armed. 

The gunshop had the aroma of lead and gunpowder every type of firearm you could image hung on the walls behind a massive burley man. For as mean as he looked he sure was helpful, he suggested a 12 gauge pump action shotgun loaded with slugs after I told him I'd be going up Deadwood Trail. He didn't have anything to say about the man roamed the forest which surprised me cause it seemed that everyone in this scarred town had a story to tell about The Tusks of Greif. 

I stood at the edge of the moss-choked forest with my newly bought shotgun remembering what the traumatized man told me. ""Grief makes it hungry."" I shook off the thought and sarcastically muttered ""The  Tusks of Greif, yeah right."" I still had about 6 hours of daylight left. If i stick to the trails and find nothing I'll come back to the car and start fresh in the morning little did I know my anger, sorrow, and grief would fuel me into a frenzy that didn't care about anything but Sarah. My boots crushed pine needles as the smell of damp earth filled me with some semblance of peace. Before I knew it night swept over the canopy like a living veil that consumed all things alive or dead. Lead by sadness I came ill prepared I didnt have the proper sleeping supplies to stay the night in the forest but that didn't matter, the only thing that mattered was Sarah. I walked for miles into the night until I couldn't take a other step I placed my shotgun on a tree and sat down beside it. Thoughts of Sarah being taken or lost filled my mind as I slowly drifted off to sleep. 

The sun rays pierced through the trees waking me from my slumber. As my eyes adjusted I saw large hoove tracks scattered all around me, too random to be an animal and too large to be a deer. I stared in disbelief wondering what could've walked right up next me as I slept without waking me. The Tusks of Greif came to mind but only for a second before I grabbed my gun and started my trek through the forest. The beauty this place held was breathtaking, the towering pine trees loomed overhead while the birds sung songs it was easy to see why Sarah loved nature. This place was mesmerizing to say the least. I had to of atleast covered 5 or 6 more miles until the sunset, I was reaching the deepest point of the forest where the trails were becoming overgrown and hard to differentiate between game trails or man made trails. The night crept through leaving an eerie silence, the birds no longer sang and I was left with the orchestra of crickets it was beautiful but nothing like the day time. With the moon held high in the sky I decided to find a spot to rest then I heard it. A guttural snort that came from the left side of me, in a panic I raised the shotgun but aimed closely to forest floor. There are wild hogs that live out here but in the back of my mind it sounded different to wet and deep to be a wild pig. I kept the weapon raised then I heard it again but this time it was followed by a subtle laugh. I fired 2 quick shots into the general direction and booked it back down the trail the way I came. I found a clearing and laid flat on my stomach not move a muscle. After you've walked for days and ran from something wild your body naturally puts you to sleep after awhile and that's exactly what happened to me. 

The following morning I woke up in shear panic with the same hoove prints around me. I sat there trying to gather my thoughts and searched for my wife's picture but I couldn't find it. Was someone fucking with me? I knew for sure there was no way I lost it while running. I frantically searched every pocket but to no avail. I stood up screamed as loud as I ever have.

""WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU!!! COME OUT YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!"" 

The bushes rustled behind catching my attention I spun around with the shotgun on my shoulder to see the old scarred man from town. 

""What do you want with me?! Where's my wife?!"" I shouted at him. His only reaction was a single finger placed over his mouth telling me to be quiet but I didn't care anymore. I put my finger on the trigger and prepared to fire then a flash of coarse fur and muscle tore through the foliage. A beast of unimaginable size lifted the man into the air snapping his spine with ease and ripping the head off his shoulders. The wet cracking sound of bones snapping and the tearing of flesh shook me to my core. I was paralyzed as I watched the lifeless corpse of the man trying to warn me get drug into the forest leaving behind a thick trail of gore. This trampled any illusion I had of The Tusks of Greif being fake, I had no choice but follow. 

I slowly walked with the shotgun raised following the blood splatter that soaked the moss on the forest floor. It went for awhile then the trail ran cold I wasn't sure if it ended or turned. A bone deep guttural voice that sounded like it drug itself from the depth of its lungs ""I need her!"" It's was sharp and wet at the edges. Without hesitation I fired 2 shots into the direction I heard it come from. A roaring groan told me I hit it so I fired 2 more rounds then reloaded. Sarah went through my mind and the thought of her being held captive or being eaten by this thing drove me crazy. I raised the shotgun and walked towards the thing. Not to far from where I fired I saw a pool of thick black blood that looked like oil and a bone white tusk the size of my fore arm. I kneeled down grabbing the tusk and placing it in my jacket pocket. ""I got you now you stupid fucking pig!"" I shouted and began to walk.

I walked for maybe a mile and came to a to a large trail. Scratches high up in the bark and coarse fur told me all I needed to know, with my weapon raised and only 4 shots left I began to walk down the trail. The forest grew thicker than before almost as if the trees were swallowing me, then came a clearing. In the distance a make shift hut made from tree branches and covered in pine needles was hardly visible but I could tell it was this things home. 

In a millisecond with no warning a tusk shoved deep into my ribcage sending me flying to the side causing my shotgun to slide across the ground. I clutched my side and before I could stand 2 massive hooves the size of dinner plates landed beside me. The face of a boar leaned over to look down on me its wedged shaped head and muscular snout dominated everything about it. The blood from the old man dripped from the maw of this beast but its eyes were filled with grief and sorrow showing subtle signs of humanity. Its massive human like hands lifted me with ease and threw me over its shoulder the muscles twitched beneath its grotesque fur. ""I need her!"" It struggled to say but before it carried me to far away from the shotgun I pulled the tusk from jacket pocket and drove it deep into the monsters neck making it drop me to ground. The moan and snorts from the beast echoed like thunder through the trees. I lunged for the shotgun hoping to get it before this boar man gets me. I grabbed the gun and rolled over to my back firing one shot directly into the chest of it. Its massive body hit the floor with a gaping, twitching, and pulsing hole in the center of it. I struggled to my feet while keeping my aim on it. The blood soaked monstrosity was able to get to its knees and began to speak at that exact moment I seen Sarah standing infront of the make shift home. Rage lanced through my veins and before the thing could get a word out I fired a shot directly into its face. Chucks of flesh and fur covered the green forest bathing it in a primeval gore. 

I ran to Sarah, she was in disbelief but when she realized I had come for her she hugged me and placed her head on my chest and said ""It.....it was raping me...."" her voice hoarse and broken made my heart sink. 

""I'm sorry honey, it's over now."" I told her as I rubbed my blood covered hand through her hair. 

We made our way out of the forest both scarred from the events that took place. Sarah emotionally scarred and me physically scarred from the disgusting tusk that ripped me open. 

4 weeks went by both of us trying to deal with the trauma the best we can, coping in our own ways and just when we thought it was going good Sarah came to me and said. 

""I missed my period.""

1nxydqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1nxydqn/any_feedback_welcome/,Any feedback welcome,"So I'm going to give a bit of context about this but not really explain the story ig. I recently came across a novel I started writing in 5th grade, but I only got through to chapter 5, and I've updated the storyline entirely because it's genuinely a good idea for a series but it was missing a lot of things. I have the whole og version of the series saved in a folder(It was right before covid that I made this- and it takes a lot of inspo off HP and The Worst Witch), and I had a whole 6-book series planned. I rewrote the entire prologue, because the original prologue was honestly lifeless and did not hook me in, or maybe that was just because the og target audience was middle grades, and now the series is more YA-coded. What do y'all think the book's going to be like or be about based off this prologue and is there anything I can do to improve it?(Btw the main character of the story isn't going to be the main character of the prologue, and the rest of the story is less real-world coded and more massively fantasy-coded):



The lobby of the Riverside County Police Department smelled of old paper, coffee, and something faintly metallic. The dim lights flickered slightly.  
Officer Daniel Martinez was sitting at his desk. He was a young man, tallish and stocky, who was recently wanting—a massive amount of wanting—to be promoted to deputy sheriff. Being 24, and expecting a child soon, he should’ve been at home. With his wife. Especially at a quarter past 11 on a Sunday evening. But no, he had to work these extra hours.  
That was the plan. Work enough hours to be promoted, then promoted again, promoted until he was deputy sheriff. Then be promoted to sheriff. He was reviewing this plan to keep himself awake, staring blankly at the screen in front of him and tapping his fingers on his desk to the rhythm of the song playing softly out of the speakers.  
“Seven Nation Army couldn’t hold me back,” He hummed softly in sync with the music, his eyelids drooping, “They’re gonna rip it off..”  
The sudden jingle of the door opening made him jump out of his skin.  
A tall blonde man, in his early-to-mid30sby the looks of it, crossed the lobby in 3 quick strides towards the front desk. Daniel stood up at once and rolled back his shoulders.  
*Gotta look professional*, he thought, cracking his neck and leaning forward towards the man.  
“Good evening,” Daniel said coolly, stifling a yawn, “anything I could help you with?”  
“Yes,” The man clipped back at once, “I was wondering if you could help me look for my kids?”  
Daniel straightened his back and stared at the guy in front of him. A missing persons report? Why didn’t he call earlier? Had he, and Daniel didn’t notice?  
No, the phone ringing would be too loud for Daniel not to notice.  
If this *was* a missing persons case…  
Would the department let Daniel help? Maybe this was how he would get promoted… He narrowed his eyes at the man, studying him. The man’s eyebrows were strung together, etched with worry. His gray eyes seemed to glow gold under the lighting, and itcreepedDaniel out. The man was also wearing a suit. It was too crisp. Too formal. Did he get home from a business meeting and find his children missing?  
*Focus*, Daniel told himself. He cleared his throat and addressed the man, forcing himself to make eye contact, “You reporting someone missing?”  
The man shook his head, and chuckled lightly, “No, I don’t wanna file anything. My kids aren’t missing. They live with their mother, she has full custody—”  
That was a red flag if Daniel had ever seen one. He nodded curtly and managed a strained smile.  
“I haven’t seen them in a while, and they moved a little bit ago so I dunno where they are. I just wanted to stop by and— and say hi to them.” The man finished.  
Daniel hesitated before replying. “Your name?”  
“Robert Harvey.”  
“Middle name?”  
“Don’t have one.”  
*Robert Harvey, arrested for child-napping 1 month from now*, at least Daniel was forewarned. He turned toward the screen, relaxing his posture a bit and leaning against the desk.  
The only sound in that office for about a minute was the clanking of the keyboard. Turns out they did have a file on him. Go figure.  
“Robert Harvey, 33, ethnicity white, blonde hair and gray eyes?” Daniel asked, and the man nodded. Daniel continued listing his address, which the man confirmed, while checking his criminal history—Which, surprisingly, the man had none but unpaid speeding tickets—silently. “Gotcha, okay… Um… Do you have the mother’s name?”  
He glanced at the man again, forcing himself to meet those eyes. The man seemed to hesitate for a moment before saying, “Yeah, yeah… Angela Evans.”  
More clanking of keys.  
“There are 9 Angela Evans on file, sir,” Daniel said, trying not to laugh.  
“The blonde one.”  
“There are 3 blonde ones,” Daniel said, fighting hard to keep a straight face, “sir,” he added for good measure.  
“*Harper* is her middle name, I think…”  
*Robert Harvey, 33, arrested for the kidnapping of the children of Angela Evans, 36, 1 month from now*, echoed through Daniel’s mind as he opened her file. She was involved as a witness at theCoachellaValley Date Fair around 12 years ago. It was a weird incident. Daniel remembered going with his middle school friends and finding that they shut down the fair for the day.  
Then a sudden realization hit him.  
“Sorry, Mr. Harvey, for asking, but…” He paused and thought his words over carefully, “What exactly do you want?”  
“Just show me the children and then I’ll tell you.”  
Red flag number 2…  
“Okay…” Daniel licked his lips over once, checking Angela’s file, “So the mother is Angela Harper Evans, 36, ethnicity white, blonde hair and brown—”  
Harvey didn’t wait for Daniel to finish, “Yes, that’s her. She used to live in Palm Springs?”  
Daniel blinked. “Yes, but—”  
“What about her children?”  
*Red flag!*, Daniel’s brain screamed, *Red flag!*  
He shook the thought out of him and looked back towards the computer. She had 2 children. Quickly Daniel tried to see if they had any files on them, and they had a few school disciplinary records.  
A boy and a girl. Twins. Recently turned 11 the month earlier, December.  
Most of the disciplinary incidents came from the boy.  
“Blair Jane Evans and Bronwen Thomas Evans.” *Note to self: Angela’s naming skills are horrible*, “Nothing to see much, the girl has almost nothing on record, she was involved in something with the boy, though. The boy has a few… strange incidents—Oh, I remember that one—both went to public school… 11, the both of them—”  
“Twins?!” Harvey exclaimed.  
“Yes.” Daniel’s brain was bursting with alarm sounds. A whole bunch of sirens.  
*“haven’t seen them in a while,” he says. But he didn’t even know he had twins, and “their mother has full custody,” could it be that Harvey never met them, and could he be trying to take them forcefully from their mother? Is this man planning to to kidnap his children?!*  
Harvey blinked, looking like he was trying to steady his breathing. He ran a hand through his hair, and sighed deeply before speaking again, “Could I see their photos?”  
*I shouldn’t do that*, Daniel thought, downloading the photos on their files, *But… if I only show him the photos of the kids, what’s the harm in that? I’m not stupid enough to give him the new address anyway…*  
“Sure.” And he flipped the computer screen to show Harvey the documented photo of the girl, Blair. It must’ve been taken a few years ago, she looked younger than her record said.  
Daniel personally thought that she looked more like her mother than anything. With the brown eyes and blonde hair, she could’ve been anyone’s kid. The only thing about her that looked like Harvey was the blonde fact about her, and maybe the nose looked similar from the front, but nothing else.  
“And the boy?” Harvey asked, his voice shaking as if he was afraid of what he might look like, “What about the boy?”  
*Robert Harvey, 33, arrested for the kidnapping ofBronwenEvans*, Daniel’s brain said loudly, *1 month from now.*  
He clicked on the boy’s photo. This boy looked a lot more like the man in front of him, but not so much that you would think they were definitely related. The closest thing about him was his eyes, and again, his nose and blonde hair.  
Harvey’s eyes searched the boy’s face hungrily.  
*Red flag.*  
“That’s him…” Harvey muttered. Daniel thought he’d imagined the man saying it, but he didn’t, as he said, more loudly: “That’s the one I’m looking for.”  
Daniel couldn’t help it, his mouth got ahead of his brain, “What about the girl—?”  
“Her too.” The man said hastily, “Look… Could— Is there— Is there… Any way that you could give me their current address?”  
*No way you’re saying yes*, Daniel told himself, *If you do, you’re calling the psych ward to let you in yourself.*  
“I’m sorry, sir,” Daniel said, trying to sound sincere instead of suspicious and turning the screen back around, “I’m afraid I can’t do that.”  
“Why not?!”  
“Because requests like that require certain… How do I say this— *precautions*. Or— Or— Um… Somebody with more authority than I have, to complete them.”  
Harvey looked at him in such a pleading way that Daniel felt pity for him. Why couldn’t he? What could this guy do, anyway?  
*No.*  
“Look, if you’re really serious about this request,” Daniel continued slyly, deleting the downloaded photos of the children, “I could ask Officer Delgado if I’m allowed to disclose that information to you…”  
He turned around and placed his mug under the coffee machine, smirking slightly, “Of course, then you would have to come back *tomorrow* or next time I’m on shift here in the lobby, so I can call him, since he’s taking the night off today and probably asleep…”  
He watched as the coffee mug filled, his arms crossed, chuckling lightly to himself.  
*Caught in the act… Before the act even happened…*  
Daniel opened the mini-fridge and took out a big jug of coffee creamer, opened a drawer, grabbed a spoon, and set them both on the counter. He waited, glancing at the shocked face of Harvey, looking at the coffee machine to finish brewing his coffee.  
His breath caught as something cold hit him square in the back. He spun around to look at Harvey, who was stuffing something in his suit, and was overcome with a strange feeling. His brain fogged up, and he didn’t seem to think straight anymore. It was like someone had dimmed the lights in his head. Suddenly the world made sense in the wrong way.  
Why *couldn’t* he give this man the children’s address? What would this man do anyway? Nothing bad, probably… He was just a guy who wanted to see his kids again.  
Daniel could get that… He had a child on the way himself, just 4 months in the womb… A baby girl…  
Dazed, and ignoring the beeping sound the coffee machine was currently making, he walked towards the computer, and scrolled down on Angela Evans’s file.  
“Y’know what? Sure, I can give you the address…”  
*What are you saying?!*  
“Good,” Harvey gasped out, “Good, good…”  
And so he did.

The door slammed shut after the man left.  
He’d copied down the address on a napkin with a pen that the officer let him borrow.  
Officer Martinez stared after Robert Harvey, blinking.  
*Why did he do that?*  
He quickly closed the tabs on the computer and slipped coffee creamer into his coffee. Stirring the mug, he glanced towards the lobby door again.  
*His eyes glowed… No, eyes don’t glow…*  
He should really get some sleep.",0,1759595026.0,writers,3,0.33,False
1nxyckp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nxyckp/jerry_stinks/,Jerry Stinks,"Hello everyone my name's Joan. I'm writing this down cause it's the only way I know how deal with the trauma that has been inflicted on me. It might be the only way to keep me sane and to avoid spiraling down the abyss that seeks to consume me. 

Anyways this isn't a story about me, my trauma couldn't be anymore irrelevant compared to what happened to Jerry Stevenson. His grueling demise will haunt me for the rest of my life and follow me into the afterlife, if there is one. 

Jerry likes to brag about how he built his business from the ground up but I know the truth. He inherited this shitty little stock company from his grandfather and slowly but surely he is draining the life from his families hard work. 
The company will inevitably go bankrupt in the next few years. 

I've been his assistant for 7 excruciatingly long years so needless to say I've got to learn all the ins and outs of him and his mentality. You can sum Jerry up into one word, an asshole. His own employees fear being laid off or demoted just for not following his dictator style rules. Every employee is to meet a daily quota and if they don't, well lets just say his punishments are bizarre and cruel. To give an example he didn't allow certain people their lunch break and forced them to work extra overtime. This illegal act has caused some employees to seek out lawyers in attempt to sue the piece of shit but no one has succeeded. Which has only made their lives worse either they stay here and Jerry preys upon every weakness they might have or they get terminated. Believe me when I say we would love to quit but ask yourself. How much are willing to deal with for $30 an hour?

I have the key to unlock and lock the doors to the building so im always the first one in and usually the last out. The company opens at 8AM, I get here around 6:45 and Jerry arrives at 7 every morning. He's never been late once in my 7 years here. He likes his coffee black with 3 sugars and needs it by 7:05, no later. One morning while struggling to get my day started I was late with the coffee, by only 3 measly minutes. 
I won't get into exactly what he said to me but lets just say it was cruel enough that I was never late with his coffee again. Another day I accidentally scheduled a meeting that was in the middle of his beloved golf tournament, which he never wins. The following 3 weeks he took my bonus and reminded me of how incompetent I am.That's just a few minor things he has done to me, one time he tried to inact Corporal Punishment meaning he can spank us with a paddle. Whenever he tried to give me the Corporal Punishment I refused and told him I'd quit on the spot. What kind of sick fuck wants to give his employees ass whoopings for not following his rules or meeting a dumb ass quota? Secretly I think he's a perverted freak and everynow and then he lets those true colors show by making strange rules such as Corporal Punishment. 

At the end of the day each member of his staff must write down what they have accomplished that day and what they can do the next day to improve. On the outside that doesnt seem bad but it's how he goes about it. One day a woman named Cheryl didn't get much done and she said her way to improve herself the next day would be to get better sleep, that wasn't good enough for Jerry. He began to talk about how fat and lazy she was saying she doesnt deserve more sleep, she only deserves more work for not being good enough. Tyler learned the hard way by sticking up for Cheryl he was forced to remove his chair and stand the entire day not even allowing him to sit on his breaks. That's just the tip of the iceberg of all the screwed up self centered things Jerry has done. But there's one instance ill never forget. 

Stacy Abrahams, a woman who has worked here since his grandfather owned the place. She called in sick with no doctors note the following morning he made her stand up infront of everyone and apologize for being lazy and inconsiderate. Then began to tell her why her husband left her calling her a slob and worthless. It went on for days, just for simply calling into work one time. It got so bad that Stacy eventually took her own life. She hung herself in the closet of her bedroom and her teenage daughter found her cold lifeless corpse swinging. I still lose sleep behind that but I bet Jerry sleeps like a baby, but he will get what he deserves soon enough. 

It was a Monday and I arrived at 6:45. I put on the coffee and expected Jerry to show up at 7 but he never did. Before I knew it, it was 8 and everyone else started piling into the office. About 8:30 the office door opened to show Jerry walking in but he wasn't the usual clean shaven, hair combed Jerry he looked rough like he hadn't slept all weekend but that wasn't the most noticeable part it was the repulsive smell that lingered around him. A smell of death and human shit so putrid you would have to hold back vomit. He said nothing and went directly to his office. The looks between me and few coworkers said it all but I still had my job to do whether Jerry stinks or not. I slowly approached his office, the smell seaped from under the door with such power it seemed to be alive. I lightly tapped and asked ""Jerry do you still need your coffee?"" He replied ""Just leave it at the door Joan"". His voice was the calmest I have ever heard it. I placed the coffee on the floor while holding my shirt over my nose and walked away. 
The day went by with ease Jerry didn't come out once to give his usual commands. The members of the group stood idoly by waiting with the information of how their days went but to everyone's surprise Jerry didn't come out to scrutinize anyone. After everyone had left I decided to knock on Jerry's door part of me wishs I hadn't. 

The smell of human feces and decay seemed to inhabit this section of the building I knocked lightly then tried the door handle, it was unlocked. I held my shirt over my face to sheild me from the awful aroma that filled the air. I slowly slid the door open to reveal Jerry standing with his back facing me but something was off. His back had begun to form a hunch at the top. ""Jerry is everything okay?"" I asked. 
His whipped back to meet my gaze and ill never forget the look on his face. His bulged out and red like he hadn't blinked in hours, large pimples and sores started to cover his face but the worst part was the brown gelatinous ring around his mouth. ""GET THE FUCK OUT!"" He screamed so loud you could his vocal cords stretching, the brown gunk around his mouth began to flake and peel showing puss filled pockets. 
I jumped back and slammed the door shut, running out of the office and to my car. 

The next day I was expecting to see Jerry's car in the parking lot luckily he wasn't there but the smell still lingered through the the office. 7am came and Jerry walked in holding a cane, the hunch in his back had grew and the smell was far worse than before it made the air around him thick enough to chew. I didnt say a word I made his coffee and left it by the door. 8 o'clock came around and everyone came in with a disgusting look. The ones closet to his office moved cubicles hoping to get away from the smell but it was so potent it seemed to be clinging on to any surface it touched. Before we knew it was time to close nobody expected to do the whole how did your day go thing so mostly everyone left. After yesterday admittedly I was hesitant on going to Jerry's office but I did it anyways. After reaching the door I could hear faint groans and the sound of vomiting the slosh of bile made me want to puke myself. I didnt knock I just opened the door. ""Jerry is everything okay and do you smell that?"" I was met with silence for about 20 seconds but it felt like a lifetime. ""No matter what I do Joan, the smell just won't come off."" His voice was flat and low with hint of desperation. ""You need to get help Jerry. Should I call someone?"" 
He was barely visible while he was leaning over in his office chair throwing up but when he sat up to look at me I knew i had no choice but call an ambulance. His eyes bulged out like balloons through a roll of tape, his unblinking gaze made me feel empathetic for a man I despised. I didnt say a word I just closed the door and called the paramedics, to my surprise Jerry left ease. 

The day after he got taken to the hospital was a gleeful day to say the least. No sign of Jerry made the workers somewhat cheerful that the dickhead was no longer barking his usual bullshit. It felt good to rid the asshole of the office even if it was just for a day. It didnt last long though causr Jerry was only gone one day. 

The next morning he showed up but his posture was contorted in odd angles his knees seemed to buckle under his weight, his elbows forced inward touching his side, and the hunch in his back was massive, so big it was forcing his head out down almost touching his chest, the smell didnt get any better still the never-ending aroma of feces and death. As usual Jerry went to his office closed the door and never came out. That day I didnt bother getting his coffee or asking him if he needed anything. Everyone went about their day and before we knew it was 7pm, closing time. There was no sense in me aiding Jerry this time cause both times previously it only scared and disgusted me so I left him in his offce and went home. I had a hard time sleeping wondering what was happening to him, it was strange to feel a tremendous amount of empathy for a man that only cared for himself. I dont claim to be a good person nor do I seek the opportunity to be one, ive had my struggles in life just like everyone else but part of me knew whatever was happening to Jerry he definitely deserved it. The man that only served himself and stepped on others along the way in now confined to small office with the smell of death surrounding him. 

I'll never forget March 4th, the day I was courageous and my courage is what ultimately traumatized me. I was running late that day so I sent to text to Jerry saying I won't get there until 8. Upon arrival I seen Jerry's car but I didnt know if he left last night or stayed at the office, after I opened the doors everyone knew the answer. 
Most left due to smell and the sight of the strange fluid that leaked from under his door. The ones that stayed became shocked spectators of the bizarre events of Jerry Stevenson. This might be the only courageous act I committed my whole life. 
I slowly walked to Jerry's office the thick liquid that seaped from under his door was dark brown with specs of red and green, it was a disgusting sludge that flowed like molasses, thick and slimy with smell of shit radiating off of it. I grabbed a broom and pushed the door open, this part will be hard to write and explain but ill do my best.

Inside of his office was disturbing. Large things that resembled blood clots hung from the ceiling like cow utters that dripped the reddish brown puss that oozed from under his door the air was dense with the smell of rotten meat. Then I seen Jerry well what was once Jerry laying on the floor. His body was contorted in such a way it looked to folded end over end several times it looked gradual, had to be painful i thought. Small broken bones protruded from blood soaked pulsing skin. The only way I knew it was Jerry is because his face was plastered on the side of this suit case sized meat mass. His eyes still bulged out in a look of horror and the brown ring around his mouth was visible from the doorway. I needed to get a closer look to be sure what I was looking at it. I grabbed my back pack placing it over my head to sheild me from the oozing slime. It was definitely Jerry all folded up and squished down into a chunk of meat but that wasn't the worst part. In the center of the grotesque flesh was a hole about the size of a golf ball it began to bloat and swell. Puckering up like lips before a kiss. I knew what was coming, I booked it out of the room then out spewed chunks of the blood clots and puss that stuck to the ceiling and walls. I turned towards my coworkers and told them to call the police. 

They arrived about 15 minutes later and shut the whole building down. We got sent home until they could figure out what happened and we will most likely never return. I sat around trying to figure out what the hell happened to him. Was it a sickness? Could I get it if it was? I couldn't make sense of what happened to him. 

Until I had to take a shit. 

The man with no morales and integrity, the man who was selfish to his core and belittle anybody he could for some type of personal satisfaction turned into exactly what he was. 

An asshole.

1nxyb5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nxyb5f/till_death_do_us_part_but_wtf_depression_hygiene/,Till death do us part. But WTF… depression/ hygiene/ what can I do?,"Let me start with saying I have no intention of leaving my marriage of 10 years. I either need a way to address these problems or this will be my life. We love each other, are committed to each other and have never had any infidelity or abuse issues. Problem is I think we have a different idea on what being committed to each other means. To me, when you love someone you put their needs/desires/comfort first whenever possible and consider how your actions/words will affect the other person(neg or positive). All of that is gravy with us both until mental illness steps in the ring. While depression has always come and gone in phases for both of us, neither of our hygiene has ever been effected until his was 2 years or so ago. 
As with any marriage when it comes to hurt or resentment, the issue is not a single item- it’s multifaceted. I only want to address one piece of the puzzle in this post or it’ll get way into the weeds. 
My biggest issue currently is:
***How can I approach the topic of my husband’s hygiene without taking what little is left of his self esteem and murdering his already non-existent self confidence?***
I could really use some advice, tactics or support here. We live a very solitary life- my friends and our families live on the other side of the country and my husband does not have any close friends (his choice, but that’s its own story). So there’s no one to see what’s going on and no one for me to confide in.
I love him and want to support and encourage him through this, but I can’t seem to bring any topic of the situation up without him feeling attacked and lashing out.
I’ve tried being subtle, tried using the idea of having sex as a way to encourage him to get clean first. I’m completely unattracted to him and at this point and can’t see a way for it to get better. He’s not seeing a therapist, won’t make any move to do it. Says if I set up couples counseling then he’ll go to the appts I schedule. He saw a general practitioner “yes man” who talked to him for half an hour and prescribed a med for manic depression- which I don’t think he is. Manic depression usually involves bouts of mania or highs, which is not a symptom he exhibits. 
————————————————————————

If you want examples of the biggest hygiene issues, they’re below. But my question could be answered without them. Writing them out is a way to vent because it’s been 2 years of some of it and a lot longer for others and I can’t share this with anyone irl- Some of you may want a fuller picture. Warning: mention of sex, nothing nsfw imo:
- If we’re in the bathroom together and he finishes at the toilet, I turn the water on and step aside from the sink. At first he’d side step and I’d say oh I figured you wanted to wash your hands. Eventually he got the hint and just goes to the sink. If I’m not in there, I can hear he doesn’t wash his hands. The idea of him preparing my food, touching everything else in our home or using his hands to touch me really grosses me out.
- He’s begun dental treatment. But he allowed his lack of dental hygiene to cause black cavities across all his teeth. So bad that he does not smile and hides his face when he does. Now that the dental work has begun at the front, he still doesn’t smile and is not keeping up on brushing/flossing. I rarely see him brushing his teeth.
- showering. He showers before work, not after. He works a dirty, physical job in hot environments. The bed reeks from him sweating at night. I keep my pillows separate and use different pillow cases to make sure there’s no confusion, but I have to wash the sheets twice a week just to be able to fall asleep.
- cigarettes. We’re both smokers. For the non-smokers out there, there’s the obvious smell of smoking on a person who does it. That’s not what I’m referring to. Washing hands, gum etc is helpful to tone it down. But he sits in it. Because of his depression he’s very stationary at home. While playing video games or on his phone he has a lit cigarette. When smoke flows across the skin on your fingers, instead of floating into the air, it can leave a yellow residue that has a stench worse than an ashtray- his whole hands smell like this. And because of the previously mentioned habit of not washing his hands, when he comes to bed at night the smell actually wakes me from my sleep and I have to get away from him. It’s impossible to describe. It’s a strong, putrid smell very different from the smell of a lit cigarette. Aside from the smell, he’ll fall asleep smoking (we don’t smoke inside, thankfully). He has burn holes in many of his shirts, on our furniture and in every pair of pants he owns.
- clothing. He’s never been much for fashion or getting dressed up, he’s always been a nature guy who likes soft comfortable clothing. Problem is he hates clothes shopping. A few years ago most of his clothes had stains from food and rips. I started bringing him home shirts and pants that are his size, his style and go well with his closet. He appreciated it and liked the clothes I brought and wears them all the time. Great! But I can’t buy them fast enough to keep up with the burns and the stains from food/coffee and now I feel like a mom dressing a child.
- coffee. I clean the walls/doors/light switches once a month, sometimes more. There’s never a time when he’s not holding a coffee cup. Problem is he’s quite oblivious to the fact that he drips and splashes it everywhere he goes. Down the walls, on doors he opens, across the floor, on our furniture, on his clothes. He has to wipe his face before I kiss him goodbye (pretty much the only time we kiss) because it’ll be wet in his mustache… he does not grab a paper towel to wipe up larger spills. Just lets them dry on the carpet or tile.
- dishes. He’s done dishes maybe 12 times in the last 2 years, he’s cooked dinner maybe 5 times or less. We don’t have a dishwasher, I work full time and we don’t have kids. Recently we got into a bit of an argument (we rarely argue) when I brought up how unfair it is that he’s laid off right now and doesn’t chip in more around the house since I still have to work. He acted like I said that he’s a loser for being laid off and all of a sudden none of his contributions matter. Even brought up that for most of our relationship he’s made more money than me which was infuriating and offensive since we’re married and here he was using finances against me when it’s never been an issue before. I wasn’t saying any of that. I’m not mad he’s laid off- I actually think it’s a good opportunity with spare time/energy to get his head on straight. Unfortunately, he has refused to use the time to get himself together. Anyway! We argued and I said it was unfair for me to do the grocery shopping, cook, put it all away and also do the dishes and put them away for every meal while working full time since he has no daily obligations whatsoever. So he’s done the dishes twice since then. Once a week, meaning he’s actually only doing the dishes he’s piled up while I’m at work. I’d call it weaponized incompetence, but it’s truly not. He just doesn’t pay attention. 75% of the dishes he does still have obvious food on them or oils from the food. So I have to rewash them. I haven’t said anything about it because it’ll be an argument of “you wanted me to do the dishes, I did them” “you’re just nit-picking”. No. There’s visible food chunks on the dishes. The act of “doing the dishes” is to take dishes from being dirty to being sanitary to eat from. It’s not nit-picking his work to point out that the task wasn’t accomplished. Instead I avoid that conversation and just do them again.
* And then there was the final straw. I won’t go into too much detail out of my own embarrassment. Our sex life has been pretty non-existent, separate from these hygiene issues and with them it’s completely nonexistent. It was once every 3 months for years. Now it’s maybe once every 6 months and I do it solely to not hurt his feelings and put my mind elsewhere until it’s done. What happened was we took a trip, got a nice hotel, showered and had a nice few hours out at dinner. We each brushed our teeth before getting into bed- and both knew we’d probably be having sex. It had been within a few hours since we showered. We awkwardly initiated (because neither of us really knows what to do anymore) and got undressed and then it hit me like I’d run into a wall. A smell I can only describe like a dirty diaper sitting in a hot garbage can. It was incredible to the point I actually gagged, unable to control the reaction. We so rarely do it and there was no way to address it in that moment without severely wounding him so I just shut up and tried to breath out of my mouth until it was over. Since then nothing has been the same for me. The thought of having sex is repulsive. Laying in a stinky bed, him touching me with hands I know he hasn’t washed, kissing me with a mouth full of rotten teeth, knowing he’s unclean in his private area and that it’s now inside of me. I can’t barely type this and I’m at the end of my rope.
In sickness and in health is what we promised and what we meant and what I want. I NEED to drag him out of this. This cannot be my life until I die. His depression is so out of hand, though I don’t feel suicide is something that he would ever consider (thankfully). However, bringing up some of the lack of hygiene habits, even hinting, makes him visibly shrink. You can see the shame in his posture and on his face. Not because of the lack of hygiene itself, but because he feels attacked. What do I do????

1nxya2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/mapua/comments/1nxya2m/internship_and_inequality/,INTERNSHIP AND INEQUALITY,"People always say, “There’s no such thing as free money you have to work for what you earn.” But why does that principle seem to change when it comes to interns? I understand that internships are meant to provide learning experiences, but shouldn’t the effort and work that interns put in also deserve fair compensation? Many interns work almost full-time hours, contributing to actual projects that help companies function smoothly. Even a modest allowance like ₱5,000 to ₱10,000 a month would make a big difference. It’s not about the amount; it’s about showing appreciation and respect for the effort they give. We don’t live in a world anymore where being young means you have no right to proper treatment. Interns may still be students, but they are also workers in training, providing real value to organizations. If they’re expected to show up on time, follow orders, meet deadlines, and complete tasks, then why shouldn’t they receive something in return? Hard work deserves recognition, and if we keep ignoring that, we’re only teaching the next generation that their effort and time are worth nothing. It’s also frustrating to hear that many companies take advantage of interns asking them to do errands like buying coffee, organizing papers, or doing unrelated tasks that don’t help them grow in their chosen field. Then, after months of internship, these students return to school without gaining the knowledge or skills they were supposed to learn. So what’s the point of that kind of internship? Learning shouldn’t mean being exploited. The same goes for student nurses. They work long hours in hospitals, attending to patients, assisting doctors, and performing real medical duties all while juggling their studies and personal lives. Many of them sacrifice sleep and even their own well-being to serve others. If hospitals rely on their service, then it’s only fair that they receive proper compensation, even just a reasonable allowance or benefits like meal and transportation support. Nursing interns aren’t just “students practicing” they’re the backbone of hospital operations during their shifts. They learn, yes, but they also serve. Their work has value, and that value deserves recognition. And to those who say, “During our time, we didn’t get paid either,” that was your time. Times have changed, and so has the understanding of fairness and equality. We live in a generation that recognizes self-worth and fights for what is right. We no longer see unpaid labor as a “rite of passage,” but as an outdated mindset that disrespects the effort of young professionals. You can’t demand quality work and dedication while refusing to provide basic compensation. Respect should go both ways. In the end, giving interns a fair allowance isn’t just about money it’s about respect, dignity, and equality. It’s about showing that every contribution matters, no matter how young or inexperienced the worker may be. I don’t and will never stand by work inequality. Every student, intern, and apprentice deserves to be treated fairly and recognized for their hard work. Because when we value people properly, we don’t just build better workers we build a better future.",4,1759594782.0,mapua,1,0.84,False
1nxy9gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongCovid/comments/1nxy9gh/two_infections_and_antibiotics_once_seemed_to/,Two infections (and antibiotics once) seemed to “reset” my Long Covid fatigue,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience — maybe it resonates with some of you or sparks discussion.

I’ve been dealing with Long Covid symptoms for about two years in total. During the first year, I had very strong post-exertional symptoms — my system was hypersensitive to almost everything. Coffee would trigger crashes. Hot showers would leave me dizzy and drained. Exercise or anything pushing my heart rate above ~120 bpm could knock me out for days. It felt like my body couldn’t handle even small amounts of stress.

After roughly a year, most of that gradually improved, but one thing stayed: severe midday fatigue. Every day after lunch, I’d crash hard, no matter how well I paced myself.

Then something curious happened.

About a year ago, I got a bacterial ear infection — my ear and lymph nodes swelled up badly. I was prescribed antibiotics, and right after recovering, I suddenly felt completely fine for about four to six weeks. I had energy again, no fatigue, no crashes. But eventually, the symptoms crept back.

More recently, I caught a simple cold — just a mild viral infection. And again, after that infection, something shifted. My remaining fatigue disappeared completely. I’ve been feeling normal for several weeks now, without the midday crash.

I can’t say for sure why this happened, but I’ve been thinking about a few possible explanations:
	•	Immune recalibration: Some researchers suggest Long Covid involves a “stuck” immune state or chronic inflammation. A new infection could trigger a temporary immune reset — shifting cytokine patterns or rebalancing T-cell activity.
	•	Neuroinflammation reset: Acute immune activation might alter microglial activity in the brain, reducing central fatigue signals.
	•	Antibiotic / microbiome effect: The antibiotics from the first infection might have changed my gut or systemic microbiome, indirectly influencing immune regulation.
	•	Time itself: Of course, it could also be coincidence — maybe I was simply healing slowly over time, and these infections just happened to line up with natural recovery points.

Either way, I found it fascinating how both infections — one bacterial with antibiotics, one simple viral cold — were followed by significant improvements.

Has anyone else experienced something similar — where a new infection or immune challenge actually made your Long Covid symptoms better, not worse?",13,1759594740.0,LongCovid,6,1.0,False

Hello everyone! I’m relatively new to this community and just contacting/interacting with spirits as a whole. I do have experience with wicca and magick though, but it’s been years since I last meddled in them. 

Recently, I’ve been experiencing a spiritual awakening of some sort and i’m turning into a completely different person: my beliefs, morals, faith, etc… and i’ve found myself in the rabbit hole of demonology, specifically being unexplainably drawn to King Paimon. I’ve researched about him and found that i actually resonate with him deeply, as an artist myself he just seems like the perfect fit for me—and i’ve also tried to contact him through listening & chanting enns, which I don’t think fully worked but somewhat got his attention since i’ve been getting many signs! I drew his sigil and have been carrying it around with me & sleeping with it, and let’s just say ever since doing that my days have been wonderful! I struggle with pretty severe depression and anxiety, but lately i’ve been feeling very confident & comfortable in my own skin which I believe has something to do with King Paimon. 

I plan to properly contact him tomorrow (sunday), I bought some dark chocolate and coffee with honey which I heard he likes! I also wrote him a letter and plan to sing for him!

Tea at Work Situation,"I'm admittedly only moderately tea-savvy, so I might be missing something obvious to others. But I love my tea. (And my coffee - but that's for a different sub.) I just don't love my tea-at-work situation. 

At home, I don't have any issues making tea. At work, though, it's complicated, messy, and I wish I had a better method. 

We have filtered water. We also have an instant-hot tap, but although I might use that for instant oatmeal, I'm not keen on using it for my tea. There are many steps to tea-making, as we know, and I'm wondering if there's truly an all-in-one gadget that does all the things - or do I need multiple items for multiple steps? 

I have made my tea at home and brought it into work, but something is missing when I do that - or it's oversteeped. I've tried just making cold tea, but while that's fine for summer, it's not what I crave in cooler months. I've also thought about gong fu, but I'm not yet skilled - and my teas seem to have fine particles that don't work well (for me) for that style. 

I've seen tea tumblers with infusers, but they don't boil the water. Portable or fixed electric kettles boil the water, but don't steep, and some don't seem to pour well. Tea balls, tea mesh strainers, and even loose leaf tea bags need a place to sit once they're steeped, and it gets messy or needs immediate cleanup. 

My beautiful cups and mugs are pretty and hold just the right amount of tea, but get cool too fast. I have a little mug heater thing that I like, but it works very slowly and only keeps it lukewarm. 

I'm looking for some kind of all-in-one solution, but I don't know if it exists for tea. I recently saw an ad for Outin, but that's technically for coffee and really expensive. I'm thinking I might just need to have a compact kettle for boiling the water, then a pot for steeping, and then an insulated mug for keeping tea warm while drinking. Is there a better way? 

I don't have a lot of down time at work, so tea time gives me just a few minutes to slow down and enjoy before I have to get back to the fast-paced grind. If my tea ritual takes too much time, I end up skipping it. But I'm a better person when I have my tea. :)",5,1759594580.0,tea,3,1.0,False

So I did a solo trip to Mysore and it felt like the right choice because weather is 🤌 rn and I scooted out of the city right before the last two days of Dussehra so I got to enjoy everything and avoided the crowd. 

I’ve always been in love with the city, it is so comforting and relaxing and calm. 

The traffic seemed manageable (don’t come at me, rn it is understandably out of hand I know) and the roads are wide, the air is so clean and fresh and my skin feels much clearer, the OG Kannadiga people means Mysore only!

Spaced over 5 days and 4 nights, here’s everything (in no particular order) I did that helped me be a tourist while filling my cup:

1. Visited the Palace in the first slot of the day: it takes up a lot of time so you need not rush through it
2. Jaganmohan Palace: Do visit if you follow arts and history else you’ll be bored
3. The Bonsai garden: Very good collection and you’ll be lucky if you go when the gardener is around, he’ll explain the different types and methods of growing to you and honestly, it’s a fascinating world!
4. The Exotic Birds Centre (Shuka Vana): Very interesting find! I’m not much into birds but it’s very interesting and wholesome, a must do in my opinion. 
5. Kukkarahalli Kere: Loved it! It is so beautiful and calming! A nice walk
6. Karanji Kere: I loved the Aviary, you get to see birds up close and it really is pretty. The butterfly park was underwhelming as there were no unique finds. Boating is good. 
7. Palace lights in the evening: The crowd was mad but what a sight! It’s so magical!
8. The Railway Museum: it’s so amusing! I liked it quite a bit! Very interesting, saw a lot of families with kids there so if you’re visiting with kids, do visit. 

Food stops:
1. Mahesh Prasad
2. The Organic Cafe
3. Westend
4. Noodle Theory
5. The Old House
6. RRR - takeaway 
7. Leaven - disappointed. There’s a lot of hype on social media so I visited but the staff just doesn’t care enough to serve well. They’re disorganised and so disrespectful. 
8. Naviluna: Great concept, great find too! Loved the hot chocolate and coffees. Do checkout their chocolates, found some of them to be unique. 

I got snacks and condiments from Surya Condiments as souvenirs, everything else I saw just felt a bit generic and honestly, what’s better than food to remember a trip by and share it with your loved ones.
