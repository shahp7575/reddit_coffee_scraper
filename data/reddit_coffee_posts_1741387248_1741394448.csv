i (25M) met this girl (22F) on january 15th, we went to a date and drank some wine together. i immediately fell in love with her. she is 100% my type, and an incredible interesting person. we kissed that day in my car. 

4 days later, she travelled to japan with her family for two weeks, and then to madrid one month alone. the connection was AMAZING. after the date we talked EVERY single day, all day long about anything. i developed feelings for her and i thought she did too. she sent me a lot of ‚Äúus in another universe‚Äù memes and reels, had a spotify playlist and played roblox together‚Ä¶ we even had a list with +15 plans to do when she comes back 

i was very excited waiting for her coming back. she arrived this sunday early morning. we had planned going to a rave tonight like 3 weeks ago, and the same sunday she asked me to go out to have a coffee with me. obviously i did and i felt amazing. i was so happy to see her after all that time. 

after that, she asked me to go out again this tuesday, two days after the last date. everything felt amazing at first but at the end of the date i felt something was wrong, i dont know what. after the date she didn‚Äôt messaged me, and started to act very distant the days after, stopped sending me reels and listening to my audios.

today was the day of the rave we planned like 3 weeks ago, and she sent me a message telling me she wasn‚Äôt felling confortable going with me to the party and she feels we are not in the same page. she also told me that it wasn‚Äôt the same in person.

im heartbroken. i never had a connection like this in my whole life. she was the best girl i‚Äôve ever met and all the illusions just erased in a couple of days. i dont know what to do.

Often whenever I drink coffee i never feel energetic like everyone say that coffee can keep them awake but in my case it is opposite coffee make me more sleepy.

In past few days I feel that I make coffee wrongly, and when I researched about it that I realise thata there is different type of coffees, and different ways to make it.

I usely make coffee like Nescafe 2g coffee powder + 1/4 glass milk + 3/4 water and boil them and that's how I make coffee. Can anyone tell me better way or right way.

Summers are here so in summers cold coffee is a good option. And i personally like cold coffee but rarely drink in market. So pls tell me how should I make it at home in india.

And i also listen that nescafe coffee isn't original coffee so I ordered below mentioned coffee powder. Can anyone check it. It relevant or not ?

- Work with startups and small businesses that don't have massive budgets
- Focus on creative hacks rather than long boring campaigns
- Learn by doing actual real-world stuff instead of just theory
-Establish a company with stability in the long run

I'm not looking for people with years of experience or anything - just folks who are into tech, marketing, or just generally interested in this kinda stuff and willing to learn.

1j64ki3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1j64ki3/why_im_leaving_to_go_to_a_stand_alone_starbucks/,Why I‚Äôm leaving to go to a stand alone Starbucks instead‚Ä¶,"TLDR: I walked out of my job today because for months we as baristas were told we were allowed to have free drinks/sandwich on our shifts and now asset protection/HR is saying we can‚Äôt even make our own drinks, so I‚Äôm going to a stand alone Starbucks where they‚Äôll at least give me a little appreciation with a free drink and meal‚Ä¶ plus more. 

I‚Äôve been at my local Target‚Äôs Starbucks since beginning of Fall 2024. Not terribly long, but I had prior experience at a similar job, at a Caribou Coffee inside of a Hy-Vee. I love being a barista. When I applied for this job, I was at my wits end at a cashiering job, craving to return to a barista job. I applied to stand alone Starbucks, Scooters, and local coffee shops, but Target was the one that bit the bait first, and surprisingly fast.

That should‚Äôve been the warning sign. 

Now there‚Äôs been a lot going on at my particular Target‚Äôs Starbucks. Just 3-4 weeks ago we only had 4 baristas, one to open and 3 closers including myself, and no team lead, the one that hired me quit because he felt the job was crap and that he could do better‚Ä¶ so he did. You can imagine how poorly we were operating.
Anyway, said team lead was a great guy. Too good for them. He encouraged all of us to have free drinks on our breaks or before we left and always made sure we ate a sandwich or something on our breaks, no cost. Him and I felt very similarly; if you work long enough to get a 30 minute break and your job can provide food, they should. It‚Äôs a bare minimum, imo.

So for as long as I‚Äôve been there we‚Äôve, within reason, had a free drink or two and meal if you want it. 
Well, today‚Ä¶ asset protection attacked. 
Now I assumed they were gonna crack down, like we had been given the okay to take from the donation pastry/sandwiches or expired/discontinued syrups. Which yes, but then they said ‚ÄúNo free drinks. You must pay for them. And you can NOT make them yourself, someone else has to make it and we will be enforcing this. No sandwiches on your breaks. You must buy and cannot make yourself.‚Äù 

As a reasonable person would do, I lost it. Not only because there‚Äôs often nights where I close alone, and maybe I want to take a drink home or a sandwich‚Ä¶ how am I supposed to do that if I‚Äôm alone? Tough shit‚Ä¶? Essentially?? But when we, as in the team here, spoke up and said ‚ÄúHey, we hear you, but why our free drinks?‚Äù The HR and ETL talking said that A) it‚Äôs not fair because they don‚Äôt get free drinks (I‚Äôm assuming this implied anyone on the floor, not just them specifically I hope) and that B) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wasting their money‚Äù, which is where they once again lost me because we throw out SO MUCH expired syrups and powders‚Ä¶ they lose it either way so why can‚Äôt you let your baristas have what little bonuses similar to corporate stores that they can. They also went to great effort to remind us ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Starbucks employees‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre Target employees‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe know Starbucks stand alone have these bonuses, but you get a Target discount instead which is so much cooler!(It‚Äôs not)‚Äù which just feels silly.

So I walked out. And I immediately called and got lined up to meet with a stand alone Starbucks here. Told them ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trained, I have a uniform, and I want to be a REAL Starbucks Barista‚Äù. Maybe I can actually earn that master barista black apron now instead of getting deer in the headlight looks whenever I ask about that program.

And yeah, if you see your local Target Starbucks struggling, just know it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault except Target and whoever decided these rules. Why be Starbucks trained just to not get ANY of the Starbucks bonuses? Forget free drinks, I wanted the Stanley Starbucks Partner employee-only cup, but you can only get it if you work at a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Starbucks. 

I took the leap. And now I‚Äôm on to better coffee-stained horizons hopefully. The only thing I feel bad about is the team I left behind, but I know the girls that have been through it like me are close to following right behind me. Just know, other Target baristas‚Ä¶ I see you and feel you. We really are like the forgotten stepchild of the store, and it sucks. Try to get into a stand alone or another place if you wanna be a barista long-term, do yourself a favor. Promise you won‚Äôt regret it ‚òïÔ∏è",3,1741393251.0,Target,0,1.0,False
1j64j9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverdating/comments/1j64j9q/31_m4f_seeking_a_partner_for_all_of_lifes/,31 [M4F] Seeking a partner for all of life's adventures!,"Like many people in Vancouver I can be quite outdoorsy, though I promise it's not my entire personality lol. I have a range of interests which vary with the seasons - when the weather gets bad in the winter I'd rather be cozy at home or wandering in the city, but when things get nice in the summer I want to take full advantage and be out in the mountains as much as possible! I'm seeking someone who would appreciate a similar lifestyle.

You don't have to be an outdoor expert to date me. What I'm really looking for is someone who is willing to say yes to fun adventures and is keen to learn. I sometimes teach various outdoor courses as a volunteer and organize many trips so you'll be in good hands! Let's watch a sunset at Cypress, backpack the Grand Canyon, bikepack in the Gulf Islands, climb Mount Garibaldi (and other big peaks), go rock climbing in Squamish or Skaha, kayak Desolation Sound, ice climb in Lillooet or Banff, road trip to Haida Gwaii, travel the world. Let's meet at cute coffee shops and concerts and thrift shops and community building events. Let's spend rainy days sleeping in and cuddling and making out, watching either prestige TV or some trashy reality show, reading together, baking, starting but not finishing random art projects, hosting board game nights with friends, laughing and having fun and being kind. These are some of the things that I value most in life and all I ask is that you be open to them. 

About me: I more or less have my life figured out at this point. I've got a cool if sometimes chaotic job as a scientist (note that I'll be traveling a decent amount over the next few months), my own cozy apartment, a custom built truck camping setup, lots of fantastic friends, and so much love to give. And I apparently really like listing things. This could be due to me being slightly neurodivergent - I can be a bit awkward at first and really value strong communication. I don't care about marriage or flashy romantic stuff but I am not afraid of committing to someone and proving that every day. The one thing I do not have room for in my life is children, so please take that into account. As much as I love animals I also don't really want pets either unless you have super reliable people to watch them when we're out on big adventures. 

Anyway, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a more genuine, funny, and reliable dude. I know exactly what I'm looking for but haven't found her yet on the dating apps or out in the wilderness. Maybe reddit isn't the place either but it's worth a try. If you vibe with any of this and want to see if we can make it work, send me a message. I agree fully with my favourite show The Good Place that soulmates aren't found, they're made. Let's get to work building something amazing :)

On here only because I've entirely exhausted just about everyone in my life on this topic in particular, so here goes. How do I move on from someone with whom I had a very short lived ""experience"" with? 

I will spare details, but yes it is as annoying as it sounds. I was ""involved"" with this person for a very short amount of time, and there was no particular big event that transpired between us. Like, at all. We gave it a shot, talked every day, had nothing in common, but we had several really sweet conversations and a lot of honeymoon phase moments, and I think I really just became delusional about them thinking this might be the ""forever"" I was looking for, despite no particularly strong indication of it at all. Eventually, I started experiencing distressing feelings of inadequacy, which I expressed, and in the end it was what led to the demise of ""us"". In the end I think we both sort of agreed we were not a good fit and parted on a bit of a sad note, but no argument or anything, just an exchange of some firm paragraphs, and that was that. No contact since. 

The worst part? It was all online. It's okay to roll your eyes here now. 

Anyway, I can not go a single day without thinking about this person. I mean, I wake up with them on my mind and most always go to sleep still thinking about them. I wonder about them, how they're doing, if they're happy, what they're doing, what we could have been, you name it. I don't know what it is. I've cut off friends before with little to no emotional aftermath - I am no stranger to knowing when to let go, and am actually quite good at it. However, I can't seem to shake this person. 

I don't know if it's because there's no one to really be mad at, either myself or them, or if it's because I'm simply still delusional. I should say, I'm in my early 20s, and have never seriously been involved with anyone. However, I live a full life with friends and family and constant busy-ness with school and an internship. I often find it hard to get time to sit and relax with a damn cup of coffee in hand, and yet, I always find the time to dwell on this person and the time we spent together.

* [Tea Squared ](https://teasquared.ca/)\- Focused on flavoured/blended teas, with a few higher quality straight teas. Some interesting microground teas for lattes and tea spice rubs. Often resold in coffee shops, bakeries, etc.
* [Shanti Tea](https://www.shantitea.ca/) \- This is another one whose blends get resold in a lot of places. I don't have much experience with them. 
* [Metropolitan Tea Co](https://www.metrotea.com/). - Speaking of companies whose blends get resold everywhere, Metropolitan is the wholesaler behind a LOT of local tea shops as well as a few larger online vendors.

Some of the flavoured blends are from Harney & Sons, some from [Tea Affair.](https://teawholesale.ca/) Quantities from 50g to 1kg.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

Anyway, thanks for reading all that. Hope to hear from you!",1,1741391445.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1j63xwp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j63xwp,Any suggestions for Studio Design?,"Hello everyone, I am new to this subreddit, but I would really appreciate your advice on my new studio (first time living alone!).

At the moment, all I have is a bed. Obviously I will start filling the place with more furniture like a table and chairs, a work desk, a wardrobe, a beside table, a sofa and TV, etc. But if you have any advice for how I should choose the layout, I would really appreciate it. I honestly have no eye whatsoever for interior design, so I'm not sure what should go where, or how best to utilize the space. 

Right now, I'm considering having a TV on the wall in front of my bed, and filling the space in between with a couch, and coffee table. Also, I  feel I need to bring in some colour to the apartment.

**READ:**¬†[**DENR takes over Rizal georeserve**](https://www.manilatimes.net/2025/03/08/news/denr-takes-over-rizal-georeserve/2069407)

THE Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has ordered a government housing contractor to vacate the 300-hectare site in Rizal ‚Äî home to the Masungi Georeserve ‚Äî following the cancellation of its 2002 Supplemental Agreement. The agency announced the agreement's cancellation in a letter to Ben Dumaliang, owner of the Blue Star Construction Development Corp. In the letter, the DENR listed three reasons for the voiding the agreement: the absence of a presidential proclamation declaring the subject matter of the contract for housing purposes, the lack of a document to prove that the proposed construction went through a procurement or bidding process, and the failure to deliver the 5,000-unit Garden Cottages housing project within five years from the signing of the agreement on Nov. 15, 2002. The project was supposed to offer housing for the employees of the DENR, Department of Education (then known as the Department of Education, Culture and Sports), Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of National Defense, Department of Transportation (then Department of Transportation and Communications), Office of the President and the Presidential Management Staff. The additional housing units under the 2002 supplemental agreement were supposed to be located in Lot 10, where the Dumaliang family built structures and currently operates the Masungi Georeserve, which is an ecotourism site with caves, limestone formations, trails and rope bridges.

AT least 77 out of 100 Filipinos favor the Philippines holding joint exercises and patrols with its allies to help assert the country's rights over the West Philippine Sea, according to a survey by the Social Weather Stations. The Stratbase ADRi-commissioned poll, conducted from Feb. 15 to 19, showed that the 77 percent of the 1,800 respondents agreed that the ""Philippine government must further strengthen its alliance with other countries"" through joint patrols, joint sails and joint military exercises to assert and defend the country's territorial and economic rights in the West Philippine Sea. Respondents from the National Capital Region gave the highest support at 84 percent, followed by the rest of Luzon at 82 percent, Visayas at 77 percent and Mindanao at 64 percent. At a forum in Makati City on Friday, Stratbase ADRi President Dindo Manhit said the survey result signals the need for the country to further reinforce its defense posture and work more closely with allies.

PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Friday assured the public the government was taking ""urgent, decisive and multi-sectoral"" actions to address child malnutrition and stunting among Filipino children. Addressing the 2024 National Nutrition Awarding Ceremony in Quezon City, Marcos said malnutrition ""exists at alarming levels"" across different stages of life throughout the country. He cited a recent study by the Second Congressional Commission on Education, which found that most students were already two to three years behind curriculum expectations by Grade 3.

WHAT is believed to be a major Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) hub in Makati City was raided on Thursday by a team led by the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission. The POGO occupied 21 floors of the PBCom Tower along Ayala Avenue. The hub had been hastily abandoned by the workers shortly before the team arrived. The air conditioners on three of the floors were still running. Although the power breakers had been turned off, a kettle of tea was still warm, and the rooms were still chilly.

The hub appeared to have been in operation based on a security logbook entry made just two hours prior to the raid around 4 or 5 p.m. Witnesses claimed to have seen employees in a hurry to leave the premises. The team found computers, cell phones, SIM cards, hard drives, OTP generators and scripts believed to be used in Bitcoin fraud and other investment scams were strewn on the desks. Authorities said about 600 people, mostly foreigners, were employed by the POGO.

Over to business, more data is needed before any revisions are made to growth and other macroeconomic assumptions, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan told reporters on Friday. After gross domestic product (GDP) growth came in at a below-target 5.6 percent last year, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman ‚Äî the DBCC chairman ‚Äî last month said that a review would be made in March. The interagency body met three times last year: in April, June and December. The DBCC in December narrowed the 2024 goal to 6.0-6.5 percent from 6.0-7.0 percent. The target for 2025, meanwhile, was expanded to 6.0-8.0 percent from 6.0-7.5 percent and that for 2026-2026 also widened to 6.0-8.0 percent from 6.5-8.0 percent.

In sports, PLDT's hitter Savi Davison is hungry for a championship in the Premier Volleyball League (PVL). And she is manifesting her intentions inside the playing court. On Tuesday, Davison put up another monstrous performance of 34 points to give PLDT a quarterfinals ticket with a 20-25, 25-20, 25-20, 26-24 victory over ZUS Coffee in the ongoing PVL All-Filipino Conference at the PhilSports Arena in Pasig City. Her monster game was built on 32 attacks and two aces and her leadership is off the charts. With her consistent showing, it is not a surprise that she ranked first in scoring with a total of 296 hits in the tournament. The scoring title, however, is not enough as the Filipino-Canadian hitter wants to take her team all the way to the promised land.

When I was planning for POA I had a difficult time finding info. Hopefully this helps someone We spent 2/21-3/3 in Hawaii and were on the 2/22-3/1 sailing. Our kids are 7 and 9, we are frequent travelers and cruisers and this is one of our best trips yet. 10/10 recommend. Please ask any questions as I am happy to help. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

For the long days off the ship, we brought a collapsible cooler so we could stop at Safeway and get snacks and drinks. We also brought Ziploc bags for ice to keep it cool. Kids LOVED the kids club on the ship and went every night after dinner. They also opened up additional times when we had a sea day due to missing Kona

We flew in Friday evening, landing around 6pm. Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach. Great hotel. Not far from the port. Kids loved the pool, beach and fireworks on Friday night. We used Uber to get to the hotel. 

Saturday morning we had breakfast and enjoyed the hotel before checking out at 11am. We used Uber to get to the port and check in was a breeze. The Hilton does have a NCL desk that you can go pick up luggage tags from to be prepared when you get to port. We used the rest of Saturday to explore and enjoy the ship. We always bring swimsuits from our luggage so we can swim right away. 

Sunday (Maui day 1)- we rented a car from Enterprise on Hana highway. It‚Äôs about a 15min walk from the ship and they allow you to park overnight on their lot for free if you rent from them. We drove the road to Hana stopping at Ho'okipa Beach Park, Twin Falls Maui Waterfall Hana (kids loved this), Eucalyptus Rainbow Trees and a couple other lookouts and waterfalls. The highlight of the day was Wai ªƒÅnapanapa State Park where we played at the black sand beach, hiked out to the blowhole, and just explored the park. You need a reservation for here and we booked a back to back reservation so we could spend extra time. This was by far our favorite part of the day and the black sand beach is stunning. 

Monday (Maui day 2) - explored the other side of the island today. Left around 8 to drive up to Slaughterhouse Beach. Spend some time playing there before we left to find a calmer surf beach so we could snorkel. (We brought snorkel gear from home). We ended up at Napili Bay. There is parking right in front or if you can‚Äôt find one there is a high parking lot across the street that has plenty of parking. This was a great beach day. We loved all the fish here. Saw turtles swimming and enjoyed the calm water of the beach. After we stopped at some local fruit stands and shops on the way back to the ship.

Tuesday (Hilo) - we rented a car and went to Volcanoes National Park. Avis/Budget has a free shuttle to and from the port. The park is amazing and we had an awesome time. The visitor center is currently closed so they have a temp one at the military camp. We stopped at all the overlooks and hiked to the bottom of the Kilauea Iki Crater. Also did the Thurston Lava tube and drove partially down the chain of craters road. I wish we would have had time to drive down to the ocean on that road but we ran out of time and had to turn back to the ship. 

Wednesday (Kona)- unfortunately we ended up missing Kona due to weather. We didn‚Äôt have much planned for Kona, just were planning on walking around town, shopping and finding a beach close to town. Although we were bummed, the NCL staff did a great job of putting together a sea day and we had a great day on the ship. We also got to sail by the Molokini Crater, Molokai's sea cliffs, and see whales from the ship so it ended up being a great day! 

Thursday (Kauai)- We rented a car (all the big companies have a shuttle from the port to the airport). Checked out the Kauai Coffee company on our way to Waimea Canyon. Stopped at the red dirt waterfall, all the overlooks and did some hiking around the canyon. Then drove into Koke ªe State Park to check out some of the hiking and overlooks. There is a small fee for parking at both of the state parks but one ticket is good for all day. Headed back towards the ship and stopped at Warehouse 3540 for some food and to check out the market. Then we checked out Poipu Beach (to scope it out for Friday) and then went to Wailua Falls before heading back to the ship. We were lucky and got a parking right on Nawiliwili Rd to park overnight. 

Friday (Kauai)- spent the day at Poipu Beach. Stopped at spouting horn first thing and then did some shopping before going to the beach. There were turtles, seals, good snorkeling for kids (it‚Äôs shallow) and good food (Puka Dogs are delicious). It was a beautiful relaxing day on the beach and there is also a playground for the kids that they enjoyed. 

Saturday - (Honolulu) - took an uber to the airport to get our rental car. Dropped our luggage off at the Sheraton Waikƒ´kƒ´ and headed to Pearl Harbor. Ate at Da Seafood Cartel before Pearl Harbor and it was phenomenal. Spent the rest of the day at Pearl Harbor. Make sure to make USS Arizona reservation on recreation . gov before you go. 

Sunday- to be honest at this point we were tired haha. We took family pictures in the morning at  Kaaawa Beach. We were planning on exploring the north shore but everyone voted to have a resort day instead. The Sheraton Waikƒ´kƒ´ is a great hotel and we had a blast there. Pool and beach were awesome. 

Monday- we had a diamond head reservation in the morning before checking out and heading to the airport. 

This was such a great trip and I feel like we had a great balance of seeing the sights, enjoying the ship and relaxing. Please ask any questions and I would be happy to help",9,1741390844.0,NCL,1,1.0,False

I am also curious to see if the Subscription is even worth it if I am only doing one or two events a week? Some of these events are like ""breathing class and coffee"" which personally seems like a very non-social and not as exciting compared to like a ""tea ceremony and sunset viewing."" or ""brunch, hike and journaling.""

How social are people at these things? I consider myself pretty social so I don't won't to be involved in a closed off/distant experience.

She is fun to hang out with, it's nice to have the company, but I know I'm not smitten, and she seems to be more into me than I am into her.  I told her I didn't really want to rush into anything and she was in the same spot - she's about 2 years out of her 2nd divorce.  We went out to a musical last weekend and I just wasn't feeling ""wow."" I mean, I had fun, she's a great girl, but I'm definitely not falling in love. 

Flash forward to this week. She went in for tests, Monday a biopsy... yesterday she texts that it came back positive as cancer and a consult for hysterectomy in a week or so. I'm going on vacation with my kids this week... I've got a little time before I'll see her again... I definitely didn't sign up for medical crisis boyfriend, and I sound like an A-hole saying that, but honestly, I was just dipping my toes in the dating pool. I don't want to dump her because she's got cancer, but I also don't wan to string her along... because she has cancer... And honestly, i would be medical crisis boyfriend if i was boyfriend and was in a deep relationship but freaking A....

We both have kids in late teens, haven't introduced (i'll wait until things are SUPER serious before I introduce to my kids.) 

How do I ease things off without being an A-hole here? So far, she's been loving being treated nice with me... wouldn't mind leaving her knowing that nice guys are out there so she finds herself a good guy.

1j63eqo,https://v.redd.it/zckytx42qcne1,Looking for Roommate** for 2bed2bath East Williamsburg!!,"**Please see end of this (long) post for important info about this lease 

Looking for a roommate for a quiet 2b2b Walk-up in Brooklyn (East Williiamsburg) only 15 away from Manhattan!!! 
IMPORTANT NOTE ON THE VIDEO: this is the one from a year ago when the tenants moved out. Everything will be EMPTY - both common area furniture/decor and your room. current roommate is in the process of moving out so everything is in boxes and messy if you come visit in person. 
Before you move in, I will: 
- Clean, repaint 
- Get a rolling kitchen cart, shoe rack, plus table+ chairs And/Or small sofa+coffee table depending on what fits 
If you have furniture you want to move in or want a say in decor, that‚Äôs a plus for me! Otherwise, leave that to me. 

- Spacious and south-facing room with a private bathroom + closet. Big enough to fit a queen bed and desk 
- rooms on opposite ends
- 4th Floor unit with skylight in living room¬†
- In-Unit Washer/Dryer¬†
- PRIME location: it takes only only 15 minutes to get from door to Manhattan. 3 minute walk to L station (Montrose), and 10 minutes to the G,J,M,Z stations¬†
- Quiet neighbors and area¬†
- Lots of nearby options for groceries and dining

Rent: 1950 for the room (negotiable)¬†total rent is 3650 as your room will be bigger 
Start Date: April 15th - but very flexible to start before or after in the month of April

ABOUT ME: 25F, WFH, I‚Äôm into fashion, art, and film. I‚Äôm very quiet, respectful of common spaces, and 420 friendly. Looking for an (ideally female) roommate who doesn‚Äôt mind me being introverted at home and is quiet, clean(!!) and respectful 

**THE SITCH: managemnt is strict about deadlines on renewing the lease. They would like an approved and signed co-tenant by this weekend Latest. However, I‚Äôm in love with the area and would rather resign by myself if I cannot find a roommate in time. If that‚Äôs the case, you will be subletting from me. We can work out the arrangements in DM and as long as you are also quiet and respectful of the space we will have no problem at all. If I do sublet I am looking for long-term (8+ months).  

Please DM if interested and I will send more details!

For context, I am 32F and my boyfriend is 34m, we‚Äôve been together for 3 years and we live together in a house that I own. Now for the story- my dad has been unwell for over a month and my siblings and I (mom died from cancer when I was young) have been taking care of him while we waited for test results and some answers. Last week his condition took a turn for the worst and he ended up being taken to the hospital by ambulance and has been in the icu for a week. He was diagnosed with cancer. We still don‚Äôt have all the answers and I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for my family. On the third day that my dad was in the icu, my boyfriend was at work and texted me about his plans for the following day that consisted of him meeting up with friends to ‚Äúplan their trip.‚Äù I knew they had been talking loosely talking about potentially going on a trip at the end of the month, but I thought it was common sense that since my dad is in the hospital, the trip would be off‚Ä¶. Well apparently not. Needless to say, we had an argument. I told him it‚Äôs extremely hurtful that he would abandon me at a time like this. 
After a lot of back and forth throughout the day he let me know the trip was cancelled (nothing had been paid for or even booked yet), but at this point I just feel like the damage is done. Who would prioritize a ‚Äúboys trip‚Äù when their partners only parent is extremely sick in the hospital. The obvious answer is to break up, but I don‚Äôt know if I have it in me to go through a breakup right now. It‚Äôs been a few days now, my dad is doing much better, he‚Äôs out of the icu and I‚Äôve been there everyday helping him with his recovery so he can come home. I‚Äôve been off work for the past week and a half during all this and went back yesterday and have been going to the hospital between shifts. My boyfriend has been moping around the house the last few days and every time I ask him what‚Äôs wrong he says ‚Äúnothing‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just sad.‚Äù I said if this is about the trip, then just go. He says that‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs about. I suggested he goes to talk to someone , a therapist or a friend.. or me. He declined all of this. I asked what I can do to help, he said nothing and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not his therapist‚Äù I said nothing and just collected my stuff and went to work. I have a lot on my plate already, and I‚Äôm feeling angry that he‚Äôs putting this on me now as well. We spent the next few days avoiding eachother around the house which was making my mental health seriously depleted. We finally had a conversation, I told him he should go on the trip because there‚Äôs no sense of him staying here if he‚Äôs not even going to acknowledge me or be supportive to me and my family anyways. The next day, he booked his flight. I tried to convince myself I was okay with it, but his 5 day trip suddenly turned into 10 days, and I just knew I was done. We had a few conversations while he was away, mostly me crying and telling him how angry I am with him. He came home, and I ended it as soon as he walked in the door. He begged and pleaded, said he ‚Äúnever would have left‚Äù if he knew I would end it because of the trip. There was a lot of back and forth and I asked him if he could just leave for a few days to give me some space, which he did. He ended up taking me on a date for Valentine‚Äôs Day later that week and things seemed to be getting a little bit better. We planned a night away the following week to try to connect again. During our ‚Äúromantic night away‚Äù he decided it was a good idea to invite his friend and friends girlfriend to join us for dinner (the girlfriend ended up not coming so it was just me, my bf and his friend) ‚Ä¶.. and then ‚Äúsurprisingly‚Äù a bunch of his other work friends just happened to be at the same restaurant. What was supposed to be a romantic evening to try to repair our relationship ended up being a table of 8 of us, talking about my boyfriends job. We went back to the hotel, got into an argument and went to bed angry. The next day we woke up and he got in the shower and left his Apple Watch on the night stand. I had that gut instinct to check his messages, and there it was. He was been messaging with another girl the entire time my dad was in the hospital and was meeting up with her for ‚Äúcoffee dates ‚Äú ‚Ä¶. Which I highly doubt is all that happened. So ya, that‚Äôs it. He moved his stuff out last week , and the person I thought I knew for the last almost 4 years has become the person whose hurt me more than anyone ever has in my life. I‚Äôm on my own again, going to be 33 next month, and starting from scratch. I don‚Äôt know what the future holds but it has to be better than this, right? ",3,1741389421.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.8,False

Is there anyway to set up the machine 1. without attaching to plumbing and use some sort of galloned water reserve that is soft enough and 2. an estimate on how much a technician cost and if they would be willing to set it up for us without going about normal plumbing procedure? I could really use some advice and am really out of my element. I am hoping to not have to return the machine since it was such a process to get it here in the first place from grant politics, etc. Thanks.",1,1741389117.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I am trying to weigh my options on the best path into CRE from a very non-traditional background.

I come from a family of doctors and originally planned to follow that path, going pre-med at a solid state school. After realizing medicine wasn‚Äôt for me, I pivoted to business through an MSM (3.75 GPA, honors graduate), but struggled to land interviews and ultimately took a revenue management role at a major airline. While I‚Äôve gained financial modeling, analytical, and strategy experience, the slow career progression, lack of deal exposure, and low pay have left me feeling stuck. I want to be in a faster-paced role, making deals, working on investments, and building something meaningful.

I see real estate as the perfect industry for me. It is analytical, nuanced, and strategic, while also being networking and relationship driven. I see this as the perfect intersection between my passions and my skillset.

I have set the long-term goal of getting into REPE or Development, whether by breaking into CRE now and working my way up, going into IB post-MBA as a stepping stone to REPE, or potentially transitioning directly in after an MBA. To prepare, I‚Äôve spent the past year relentlessly upskilling by completing all Wall Street Prep, Break Into CRE, and the CRE Analyst Program, getting my ARGUS certificate, finishing REFM (all levels), and getting my real estate license. I also scored a near perfect 765 on the GMAT to maximize my MBA options. Despite aggressive networking and preparation, I‚Äôm still struggling to gain traction in the industry.

As stated, I have considered an MBA, but, through coffee chats, I continue to hear that CRE is an industry where it‚Äôs best to just get in grind, and build a network and a skillset, and that an MBA wouldn‚Äôt add much value. However, I haven‚Äôt had much traction breaking in as is, which makes me wonder if an MBA would be the best way to reset my career and open new doors.

Now, I‚Äôm considering an MBA (2026 start) but have concerns:

1. Will an MBA actually help me land in CRE/REPE, or will I just be a few years older in the same position?

2. I‚Äôll be nearly 32 at graduation. Is that too late to pivot? Would I be better off grinding for an entry-level real estate role now instead?

3. If an MBA is the right move, how should I best use the next 16 months? Should I take an entry-level CRE/finance role, find an internship, stay in my current job, or do something else?

4. Is breaking into REPE more viable through CRE now, IB post-MBA, or directly from an MBA?

I‚Äôm working my butt off to get my career on track and am feeling stuck. For those who‚Äôve made similar pivots or gone the MBA route for CRE, what‚Äôs the best move from here? I‚Äôm feeling stuck and would GREATLY appreciate any insights.

I have been measuring grind times and weights. The times seem normal, but the output is way short. Like 55g when it should be 80. I thought the grind was a bit fine, so I took the top off and adjusted the burr out a bit, which helped, but it‚Äôs still really weak.

1j62idh,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j62idh/best_roi_from_stars/,Best ROI from Stars,"I‚Äôve found the current most efficient use of stars.

My go to order is either a Pistachio frappe or an iced pistachio latte with cold foam. Getting either of these would normally be 200 stars, or around $7.

However, with 100 stars, you can get an iced coffee with pistachio sauce (or whatever syrup you like), and add any cold foam (pistachio for me) plus any toppings. All additions are included under the 100 stars, which ends up being the value of a $9 drink, and I honestly kind of prefer this flavor anyways.

To earn stars, bring in a personal cup or get a cold cup for $3. Every time I order to pay, I add however much I‚Äôm about to spend to my in-app gift card‚ÄîI thought it‚Äôd be annoying to the baristas at first, but it takes literally like 10 seconds, and avoids having to add set amounts like $10 or $20 to the app.

Now, every time I order, I earn double stars from the gift card and 25 stars for the personal cup. This means that every time I pay for a drink, I earn 38 stars, or I get a free drink every 2.63 drinks I buy. This is a much better ROI than just scanning the app, getting takeout cups, and using the 200 stars.
