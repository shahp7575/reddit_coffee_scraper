Jenny Li woke up at 4 am every day. She’d put on her school uniform and brush her teeth before grabbing her backpack and sprinting out the door. She’d hop the fence, and there was a little dark alley she had to walk through. They kept the front gate down, so she could only enter through the back door to the kitchen of Lee’s Donuts. Her parents had her help with the register early in the morning. Her mother would fry the dough and work the grill. Her father would sit at a desk in the back room, scribbling down numbers. She had tried to ask him what he was doing, but whenever she asked, he’d pull out a whiteboard and talk for hours. When he got started, he never stopped talking about SWOT analyses and value propositions. Oh, or index funds, never forget … uhhhh something about Roth IRAs and index funds. She’d zone out while she pretended to take notes. As her dad droned on and on, she drew little animals and flowers. 

Her parents bought the space 4 years ago when it was first put up for sale, between a 7-Eleven and a laundromat. Her parents snatched it up, signed a bank loan, and quickly began renting a “2 bed 1 bath” in the complex behind it. She thought it was stupid to call it that because they didn’t even have a bath, only a shower. She found it equally confusing that they named it “Lee’s Donuts” instead of “Li”.

“That’s not how you spell our name.”, she said to her dad.

He picked her up as they walked around the store when they had just started to get their signage in. 

He chuckled, “Jenny, there are a lot of things you’ll learn about the world one day, but today is not that day.” 

He smiled at her.

“Trust me! You’ll understand when you’re older.”

She climbed up onto the high chair she had to use while she checked people out. “Hi Paul!”, she said to the old man in front of her. Paul was their first customer every day and always ordered “the usual”, which was a Large Hot Black coffee and a powdered sugar donut. 

“Hey, little Jenny Li, how are you today?”

Jenny grabbed a recyclable sleeve and a paper cup, poured him a drip coffee with a little room at the top, and grabbed the powdered donut. A little powder would fall from the donut onto her school’s strictly enforced dress pants, something the kids from older grades would tease her about. Even the teachers would get on her about it when they were heavily coated with powder. That was usually on rainy days when people ordered donut holes to dip into a hot coffee. Her teachers would say, “Come on, Jenny. You’re in middle school now, you really should know better than to show up to school dirty”, before they’d send her to the bathroom with a wet rag to wipe them down. Other than that, she was the perfect student, a shy and quiet girl who always came home with straight A’s, gold star stickers, and notes about how she was “Always a joy to have in class”. These would only be skimmed to confirm they were identical to last quarter before they sat in the recycling bin she had to take out every Wednesday. 

Jenny traded the cup and bag to Paul for a 5-dollar bill, and he’d hold them with his shaky hands as they had their daily catch-up. Paul said a long time ago that he had something called “Parkinson’s Disease”, but he’d been a regular for so long she barely noticed it anymore.

“How goes it, Kid?”

Paul had lots of stories and moments of wisdom he’d share with Jenny every day. He’d tell her about Shakespeare and Woodstock, to make sure to keep a jar of all the loose change she found because it builds up over time, and about his younger days as a Theater Director in New York. Her parents kept a big map on the wall for the customers to put little pins into to mark where they were from. Every day, Paul would cover a part of it with his shaky fingers and say, “What’s that?”. They’d been through the countries and capitals and were now onto rivers. 

Today’s was easy.

“Come on, Paul. You asked me that last week. That’s the Euphrates River.”

“Kid, you’re a genius.” 

And then they talked about the weather or funny stories from school, or what was on the radio. Paul came in very sad on some days. He lived in his car down the road with no family and couldn’t get a job. Some days he’d look at the donut and say, “I know these things are gonna kill me if I keep eating them, but having to spend any more than $5 on breakfast will kill me first.” Paul was “on disability”. When he was quiet and down, Jenny would work extra hard to cheer him up and show him all the drawings she’d make on sticky notes and index cards she made while she waited for the bus to come get her. He couldn’t help but warm to a smile, and before he left, they’d be joking and faking voices for the people passing the shop’s glass door, walking to do their laundry.  

He’d say, “You know, kid, some days, this is the only thing I have to look forward to, and you know what? That’s more than enough.” He said when he could find a job, he’d buy her a nice pack of colored pencils or markers to repay her for being such a good friend. 

Paul pointed at the map again. “Christmas Island”. And again. “Norway”. A third time. “Algeria”. He asked her the capital of Jordan. They hadn’t done capitals since September. Something was up. 

“Ok, so. What’s with the pop quiz?” she asked. 

He smiled at her, reaching his hand, which was now extra shaky, into his jacket pocket. He pulled out a folded-up newspaper, turned to page three, and put his hands on his hips, grinning from ear to ear.

“Okay, it’s a newspaper.”

Paul rolled his eyes and poked his stubby finger at the title of an article that took up only a third of the page. His dirty fingernail went thunk thunk on the glass of the display below it. The National Geographic was holding its geography bee in Philadelphia this year, at a building just biking distance from the shop. Reading the fine print, her eyes passed over the words televised audience, 4:00 pm, and finally landed on “First Place - $5,000”. She quickly tried to think about all the things she’d ever wanted to buy, added them up, and it still didn’t come close. She thought about asking to go out to dinner before her parents told her it had been a slow month at the shop. She thought about the Canson Mixed Media book that sat on her art teacher’s desk, and how it was much nicer than anything they got in class.

“Well, kid, I told you I’d get you those markers someday.”

Two weeks later, she was pedaling as hard as she could to get to the building on Main Street, even though she was two hours early. 

Turns out most of what they call a geography bee is filling out forms and waiting in line. Her parents kept the shop running until dinner time, people usually filing in after work for a tuna salad on an everything bagel and no onions or a turkey sausage egg and cheese burrito but add avocado and green salsa. Jenny stared at the Yellow Enamel Nat Geo Pin next to a name tag that read “Miranda :D” on the blonde lady’s navy blazer. “And your dad’s gonna have to initial this part, honey”, she said, pushing the clipboard forward.

“Oh, um. He’s in the bathroom. I’ll be right back”.  She grabbed the clipboard and black ballpoint pen before rushing around the corner and flipping through and scribbling “T.L” on every line she could find with an X next to it. She handed it back with a ziplock that held 15 dollars in quarters for the entry fee. 

“Thank you, sweetie”, said Miranda before she crossed her red acrylic fingernails, crunched her eyes, and squealed “EEK! You’re gonna be on TV!” as she fake-jittered with excitement. The thought of hundreds of people seeing her on TV made Jenny nervous. She looked down at her dirty Keds and thrifted blue jeans, a little embarrassed by her sweaty and matted helmet hair. She figured it would be okay, only old people watched National Geographic. She grabbed a complimentary water bottle and sat in her section. 

The kids were separated into two age groups, middle and high school, and all the other middle schoolers were playing on their phones or quizzing each other on Mnemonics. She passed two identical twins with the numbers 101 and 102 hanging on their line-cards, which dangled down their necks, held in place with yarn and staples.  Jenny was number 238. The boy said to his sister while counting on his fingers for some reason, “And then Balls, which means… uh, balls is supposed to be…” Jenny rolled her eyes and sat down criss-cross applesauce. Who forgets the Baltic Sea? 

She didn’t recognize any of the kids in the big ballroom where they all waited. She almost tapped a girl on the shoulder before asking if they were in the same school district, but got embarrassed about her powdery t-shirt and sat back down. She grabbed the pen she had nabbed from the signup desk from her pocket and began to doodle on the back of her number card. She waited and waited and waited. Once she filled up the back side, she waited some more until she got bored again and started drawing little vines and leaves as a frame around her number. Just as she started coloring them in, the kids all began to stand up and make their way into a single file line. There was a big hush that made her a little nervous as they walked toward the stage onto the stage. She wished she could hear a pin drop, but all she could hear was the twins again, whispering something about the border of Nepal. The floor creaked before the crowd of middle schoolers settled. There were soft boxes on the left and right of the podium, and big headlights pointed right at the microphone. The soft hum of the cameras filled the stage, sitting on top of rigs and gimbals twice her size. Their red lights blinked at her rhythmically. She heard from past the curtains, “Ok, let’s give a huge round of applause for this year’s contestants”. The curtains parted, and she heard a thundering applause as she tried to squint to see the rows of old people. She started to freeze up a little when she noticed how many families were there. She blew out a little bit of air and thought about the Canson sketchbook again, thinking, “Well, here goes nothing.” The judges beckoned the first contestant forward, and the little boy’s slacks swished against themselves as he walked up to the microphone. He tapped the mic. The man in the center of the judges' table raised his hand and smiled before saying in a dramatic voice,

“Okay, young man. Which country… is shaped… like a boot?”

The rest of the competition seemed to fly by, and Jenny could hardly remember any of it. Even though she found the questions easy, she stammered nervously through her answers when it was her turn to speak. The early rounds had kids dropping out like flies, over questions Jenny thought were for babies, and she was a little disappointed that they were pulling their punches for middle schoolers. She blushed a deep red when the microphone feedback pinched her semi-finals answer.

“Gu-“ SCREEEEECH “Guatemala.” 

She rushed back to her spot, trying to forget that people were going to see this on TV.  She won with “Lithuania”, an answer to what seemed like more of a language question about which former Soviet Union country shared the most in common with Sanskrit. It had hardly even hit that she had won because that seemed like one of the easy ones. They handed her a big fake check and asked her to smile for the local papers. She felt stupid holding the check and thought about the guys who got paid to stand on a street corner twirling similarly sized signs around. In the middle of this thought, the cameras clicked and flashed, catching her in a half blink. Finally, the male judge, who got his own microphone, held it up to her and pointed right at the cameras. 

“Alriiiiight, Jenny, any words of advice to our viewers out there? Maybe for future contestants of the Nat Geo bee?”

Her thoughts raced as she tried to find an answer.

“Ummm.. always… believe in yourself and… and anything is possible?” 

The host looked right into the camera as he said, 

“Wow. Truly inspiring words from this year's winner of theeeee National Geographic Geography Bee. Let’s hear it for Jenny Li!”

There was one last round of thundering applause before the curtains closed again. After she walked off the now-empty stage, they took her big fake check and gave her a normal-sized one. The ballroom was empty since all the other contestants had no reason to be there. She pocketed the check and biked back home. 

When she lay in bed, she thought about everything she’d ever wanted to buy, but nothing seemed as fun now that she could afford it. She was more excited to tell Paul, to thank him, and tell him she couldn’t have done it without him. She rolled over to face the wall, examining the small scenes she had drawn with an off-brand permanent marker. She let herself have one small win. Paul would have to wait because tonight, she was going to sleep in.",1,1766470160.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

It's eight months since the local elections, so i was going to split that and compare. Then saw a post on the sub for the whole year so added in the first 4 months, but it turns out a lot of by elections got deferred to coincide with the May elections, making a worthwhile data point in its own right. This is just for the major parties, over 10% of local elections go to independents or regional parties etc.

1ptmeyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/VACCINES/comments/1ptmeyc/i_strongly_believe_in_being_vaccinated_but/,I strongly believe in being vaccinated but...,"My last two vaccinations did not go at all well: 

I can understand why people can become cautious about having vaccinations after my negative experiences with some seriously bad side effects. Covid and Shingrix

I just got my Shingrix vaccine:

I had the vaccine 2 days ago in the early afternoon. Yesterday morning I woke up with chills and muscle aches. They got worse through the day to the point that even my fingers had chills... This is not so bad as I am an odd duck and actually enjoy chills as they remind me of the rush I used to get from cliff diving.

That night though, after the chills dissipated, a spot on the right side of my head started to hurt just above and behind my ear. An hour or so later a spot on the front right side of my head started to hurt, then the top of my right ear, then the back right side of my head...

I can not have anything touching the right side of my head at the moment. I have a nasty headache and even bending my neck makes the side of my face hurt.

I understand the vaccine can't give you shingles but I have had shingles a minimum of three times, the first time was in my late twenties, I know what it feels like. My most recent bout was about 2 years ago. Hence getting the vaccine.

About the same time my head started to become sensitive my right leg started to twitch at odd moments and it is starting to drive me a little mad. I used to get leg twitches after I was put on gabapentin for neuropathy due to a back injury. I have not had them, gabapentin or twitches, for many years.

I guess tomorrow, if this is still happening, I will be going to the pharmacist who administered the shot to see what I should do next.

Anyone else with this response to the vaccine?  


COVID VACCINE (Moderna):

A couple days after my second COVID vaccine, along with the chills and other side effects, I started experiencing chest tightness and constant heart palpitations... lub dub, lub dub, lub....DUB, lub.......DUB, lub dub, lub...DUB.

Let me tell you it was frightening. Those big DUBs felt like someone had slapped me in the chest from the inside; The vein on my neck, just above the collar bone, would jump out like.. it was just really frightening for someone who had never experienced them before. 

these would be followed by a couple minutes of normal before it started again..  And the chest tightness... I just felt like someone had stuffed a bunch of extra crap inside my chest all the time. My meals decreased in size because a full stomach meant more tightness.

I gave up caffeinated beverages, chocolate, etc... shortly after this started happening as I found those things made it worse almost immediately after consumption.

Sometimes I would get a few days, or even a week, where I would only have the tightness all the time and palpitations would happen for perhaps 5 minutes per hour, or last half an hour twice a day. Periods with shortness of breath and dizziness.

I was frequently woke up at night and a few times I went to the hospital thinking, combine with the tightness of my chest, and sometimes bit of arm pain, that I was having a heart attack. I would be hooked up to an EKG sometimes for 60 seconds, sometimes for 10 min, then be told that everything was fine and they could see nothing wrong.

Of course I would tell them what I was experiencing.. they just never caught it. When they finally did catch it and I felt momentarily vindicated ""thank god you caught it that can happen for days at a time non stop! Sometimes every couple minutes! what do I do?""... The doctor  told me its just a case of heart hiccups and I should not be concerned. Seriously just completely brushed it off. When I pressed the point he became annoyed and basically told me to put my big girls blouse on and deal with it... He would not send me for further testing despite the fact this had been going on for well over a year. 

At this point I gave up trying to get help for it... when it got really bad I would just try to find a comfortable position and ride it out and in my head I would tell myself ""if it is that time, its that time"" 

I stopped drinking alcohol. I started taking magnesium supplements. This seemed to help! The tightness went away for a couple months. I though I had figured it out.

About six months after seeing that last doctor I went in for a booster shot... and it all started right back up again.

I ended up getting an appointment for a stress test and halter... a week before the appointment I got shingles pretty bad. I was sent for an eye exam instead as I had itchy eyes. Apparently you don't want shingles in your eyes.

I ended up just managing the symptoms this time. The chest tightness finally went away after another year or so. The heart palpitations remain albeit only once in a while. Chocolate, Alcohol or coffee, bring it back for a few hours. Especially dark chocolate or coffee. If I drink enough alcohol to have an effect the palpitations start shortly afterwards and can last days.

A while back, when describing this to a good friend of mine, I was told his uncle was admitted to the hospital after describing the same symptoms and at about the same time as I had my original vaccination. It was determined he had myocarditis (swelling of the heart) due to the vaccination. He was treated He does not have palpitations anymore.

It turns out that having palpitations for as long as I did and with the frequency I would, more than twice a minute for extended periods, can lead to weakening of the heart muscle and other complications

I am left wondering if I would have recovered sooner and without lingering palpitations if I had been listened to when I first started presenting.

I do not go in for COVID boosters anymore. Not because I do not believe they are effective, I am sure they are, but because I do not trust that doctors will listen to me if it kicks off a more serious bout of palpitations. While I strongly believe in civic duty I believe it should be reciprocated and feel quite betrayed.

1ptme4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ptme4f/my_keto_food_alternative_master_list/,My keto food alternative Master List,"Hi everyone! Earlier this year, I shared how much keto has helped me with not only losing weight, but correcting my terrible relationship with food. Since then, I've lost over 45 lbs and counting, which is awesome - but the best part personally has been finding new ways to safely eat foods I loved before. 

That being said, I wanted to pop in and share my personal master list of keto-friendly food/snack replacements for anyone who may be either getting started or just curious. Some of these are already pretty well-known but I wanted to share anyways. It can also be difficult to get fiber intake on keto, so some of these should help with that. These are also generally great for getting off really high sugar/high simple carb filled foods outside of keto, which has helped my partner quite a bit.

Aside from the one other kid I was the next most well liked in my class. I played all the sports (football, baseball, soccer) so I pretty much knew everyone. That all changed in 3rd grade when I shut down. I became a mute and starting play with my fingers all day, pretending they were WWE wrestlers. 

I'm 25 going on 26 now. You may be wondering why I am here dwelling on elementary school. It's a fair question. The reason is that as far as I can tell, this moment of my childhood was the turning point that explains the trajectory of my life since. Buckle in because this post will be very long.

Of course my teacher noticing that I had become detached proceeded to intervene. They had me tested assuming I must have some kind of disability. All they came away with was that I had an ""anti-social personality"" (not the disorder) but they put me in special ed anyway. I started to be pulled out of class with the other special needs kids.

Regardless of if this was the right call or not which I think could be debated, I don't blame these adults for anything. I gave them reason to be concerned after all. Don't know if I was just having some kind of tantrum or what. Or maybe I have Aspergers and they missed it. I've had a doctor suggest that and it certainly lines up with some of my behavior.

Being in this new category affected how I was viewed by my classmates as well as my own self esteem. I still managed to maintain friendships. Some of which were made before I detached and others even after. My classroom behavior remained the same year after year. I didn't speak beyond saying the bare minimum.

My grades were average. At the beginning of middle school I actually began to excel for a brief period of time. I managed to use this to get myself out of special ed. It didn't really matter because the damage was done concerning the way I was perceived. Of course I suppose I could have shocked everyone and started talking all the time one day, but as a kid I just kept following the same old patterns that were comfortable to me.

Essentially everyone aside from those in my friend group went on believing I had a disability and treating me accordingly. It began to not really bother me over time and middle school was probably the best years of my life. I reflect fondly on school dances, trips to amusements parks, sleepovers etc with my pals. Dating was out of the question but I looked at it as an exciting thing for the future. Most kids weren't doing it yet anyway.

Everything changed on the last day of 8th grade in 2014. You see, I had been engaging in another more subtle self-sabotage mission for a couple of years. At the lunch table I had been telling inappropriate jokes on a routine basis. Most of my friend group seemed to find it funny but one kid took issue with the things I was saying. His parents were police officers and he was a little more of a tightly wound type.

He reported me to the guidance counselors office. I received a stern talking to by a mustached man. I ran to the lunch table the next day talking about it and wondering who reported me. Of course this lead to the gossip spreading around my school. On top of being mysterious and a little scary, I had now also gained a reputation as disgusting.

My friends stopped hanging out with me at this point, presumably not wanting to be associated with me. They did prank call me from a sleepover together to make fun of me no longer having any friends. High school started off pretty miserable. I now sat alone at lunch everyday and got bullied by seniors as the low man on totem pole.

In a way high school after grade 9 still seems ideal to me now. I managed to pick up a one off friend here and there just from people talking to me. We would go to a fair or to the casino. Eventually I was invited back into my middle school friend group and I joined a film club with them in which we would produce little sketches.

Then I graduated in 2018. This is when things became 100% cooked for me. I went to a small college an hour from home. My ability to connect with people was non-existent. I was already in the habit of barely talking and this didn't change. Again, my continued self sabotage. Started having panic attacks in 2021 and dropped out of physical school.

I started living at home finishing my degree very slowly, only completing it last May after 7 whole years. All this time having very little interaction with the outside world. I started a YouTube channel in 2023 and had a scant few people enjoy my videos at least. I have a shred of charm in front of a camera but not enough to earn any kind of a real following.

I majored in political science though I am not going into the field. Instead I will be working at a coffee shop my parents who work in the restaurant industry are starting. It will just be me and an older woman who doesn't speak English very well. I will be dealing with customers all day, and am just hoping I will be able to rely on my NPC script to get me through the it.

I know i'm still just a kid but I can't help but think the rest of my life sounds grime. It goes without saying but i've never been in a relationship. I haven't had any friends for 7 years now and will be dealing with whatever hell people want to give me in a customer service position. I bused tables in high school so I know how that goes a bit. I have an overbearing father and am really sick of living at home as well.

All in all it's probably exactly what I deserve, but the victim side of me wants to say I didn't do enough to earn this form of eternal damnation. Maybe I should take accountability for myself and join some kind of adult club. It sounds like painful exposure therapy for my social anxiety. Plus I feel like a 12 year old in any adult space. So i'm probably not going to force myself to do such a thing anytime soon.

I guess this is just a long tale of squandered potential. If you've read this far I appreciate it. Definitely leave me a comment because you're probably the only one. Tell me what you think I should do, where you think I went wrong, what you think might be wrong with me, whatever comes to mind.",1,1766469406.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

A lot of people online make it look effortless, with perfect café-style foam in seconds, but I also keep seeing comments saying the foam dies fast or only works with very specific milk.

I’m asking because I’ve been thinking about getting one for home use. I drink a lot of coffee and usually just heat milk on the stove, but I’d love to make decent cappuccinos or lattes without dropping a ton of money on a full espresso setup. The problem is I can’t tell if a standalone frother will actually give consistent, good foam or if it’s one of those gadgets that ends up in a drawer after a week.

For those of you who use milk frothers regularly, do they really hold up? Does the type of milk make a big difference (dairy vs oat/almond), and is there a noticeable gap between the cheap handheld frothers and the electric jug-style ones? I’m mostly curious whether it’s worth buying one at all or if I should just keep things simple and skip it.",1,1766469255.0,ProductQuery,0,1.0,False

However my fiancé seen how much fun I was having and thought he might get his license too, he asked if I’d care as it’s “my thing” and made such a big deal about this grand gesture he has done for me.. initially I didn’t mind but now his riding skill is better than mine and he has friends that he can call up and go for rides, he went to a country town with a mate for a coffee, that’s what Ive voiced that I want to do. So I’m finding myself jealous of his mates he has, where I have none that ride and the biker scene isn’t huge in my town and getting jealous also that his skill set is surpassing me.. so I feel incredibly overshadowed for something that for once was meant to be all about me, he’s just taken the limelight and made it about him.

It’s been three years since I lost my vision. I know this because I have felt the cold touch of winter three times since then. Losing my vision is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. It would be one thing if I were born without vision, but losing it in my late thirties only added to my midlife spiral. This spiral continued until 7:30 AM this morning, when I was offered an experimental drug that would gain some of my vision back. I was a little weary at first. I have never been one to take risks, even when I could see, but what more do I have to lose?

The knocking at the door woke me up from my inky slumber. An avalanche of beer cans crashed to the floor as I hobbled to my feet. How did I fall asleep in the recliner again? As I used my hand against the wall to guide me to the door, I could feel the aging wood moan, its many years of decay now crying out as it rotted in place. The person on the other side of the door didn’t stop knocking until I flung the door open. 

“What do you want?” I croaked out. “Good morning, sir! Sorry for waking you, but I have an offer you can’t refuse!” The man on the other side of the veil was too energetic for my liking; his tone sounded like he was holding back excitement over something I didn’t know. As he spoke, I could smell yesterday’s cigarettes and this morning's mint, which failed to mask the ashy scent. I was able to reply with “Just spill it already, I am a busy man” before the man chuckled. “Oh, I know you are, sir, but I have an offer of a lifetime. How would you like to be one of the first people on this planet to try our new miracle drug, Helio?” The man paused after excitedly spilling out his words, almost like he knew what he was going to say next. “Why would I try a 'miracle' drug? There’s no such thing, now get the hell off my porch before I-” But before I could finish slurring my words, the man cut me off. “I know this sounds too good to be true, but I can confirm it works! One pill of Helio is all you need to be able to see and more! Plus, if that doesn’t sway you, we are offering $15,000 to anyone willing to try”. I snorted and replied, “Oh, what bullshit”. As I started to close the door, it was suddenly stopped by a hand slamming on the door. 

The salesman was closer to me than expected. “Steven, I know about the accident. What more can you lose? We pay upfront, so even if it doesn’t work, you will still have the money to do whatever you like. Think about it.” After a few beats of silence, the man stepped back and started to walk away. It took me a moment to contemplate the choice: do I want to risk my life to take a drug that would probably fuck my life up, or do I want to continue my life in the dark? But at this point, what life was I even living?  “Wait, let me see the money first,” I called to him before he was out of earshot. The man let out a soft chuckle as tootsteps quickly rushed up the porch steps before placing a stack of newly printed money in my outstretched hand. The money felt crisp in the palm of my hand. Even though I wasn’t sure if it was the right amount of money, I didn’t care enough to be sure. “Listen, I will take the pill, but if anything goes wrong-” The man cut me off once again. “It won’t.” He said in a stern voice, the first time he was serious in the whole conversation. I felt the pill drop into my hand. It was slightly squishy, like the skin of a newborn. “Pleasure doing business with you, and here is my card”.

As I stumbled back into the living room, I considered even taking the pill at all. I could just take the money and throw the pill away. But as I was walking to the kitchen, I knocked a picture off the wall. The shattering of the glass was louder than I expected. I knew what that photo was; it was my wife and me on our wedding day. I can still remember what her dress looked like. The white dress flowed like a river as she walked down the aisle. If only I could hold her one more time. But I could see her picture one more time…..

“Fuck it,” I picked up a half-empty beer can on the floor and slammed the beer and pill without a second thought. After a few moments of standing in the darkness… nothing happened. “Miracle drug my ass.” As I was about to put the can in the recycling bin, a flutter of light crept into my vision, blinding me out of my eternal darkness. This was the first streak of light I have seen in years. Slowly, like an old TV being turned on, my kitchen became visibly in a static haze. I was able to look around and see my kitchen for the first time since the accident that took more away from me than I could ever have thought was possible.  The kitchen was covered in years' worth of garbage. I could always smell the heaping mound of trash scattered around, but I never gave it much thought since I couldn’t see it. “Holy shit,” I couldn’t believe it worked. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes. Without warning, part of my vision went back into the inky prison. I could still see my surroundings, but I could also see a black void. My mind was racing to figure out what was happening, but I got my answer before I figured it out. On my lower back near my waist line, I felt something….blink. Quickly, I felt around on my back until I poked it. The pain was excruciating; it felt like I got poked in the eye. Half in pain and confused, I stumbled into the bathroom. 

The man in the mirror was different than the last time I saw him. His eyes were bloodshot, like they had seen a world of pain, even though this was the first time they could see anything in a long time. All the light that used to radiate from him was now gone and replaced with a husk that oozed darkness. I spun around to find the painful spot on my back but as I lifted my shirt, I wished I had never done so. There, on my lower back, in between a brown mole and the back hair, was an eyeball. The eye was covered in a light coat of slime similar to a newborn baby. The eye was yellowed with the iris being a striking blue, which was different from my natural brown eyes. I screamed the second I saw it, backing away from the mirror. But what confused me more than anything was that I could see through it. It was like looking at a computer with multiple windows open. I could see through the eyes on my head, but also through the one on my back. 

I left the bathroom in a blur. I had to find the card to call the salesman back. As I rounded the corner into the living room, I felt a loud POP on the bottom of my left foot. Pain shot through my body like lightning as I crashed to the floor like a chopped-down tree. Through gritted teeth, I turned my foot towards me to get a look at what I stepped on. Only I didn’t step on anything that was scattered on the floor. Instead, I put all of my weight on a fresh new eyeball that formed on the bottom of my foot. The splattered eye pooled in a pond of blood as it hung on the crumbled optic nerve still connected to the inside of my foot. The new eye socket was less than 20 millimeters wide and oozed a milky white liquid. The white liquid and blood flowed into each other but refused to mix together, like oil and water. As I reached my hand to my foot, I could see my face looking back at me through one of my new eyes, which was now located on my right fingernail. I watched in disbelief as each of my fingernails split in the center to create an eye. Each time a new orb broke through the layer of skin, I was able to see through it, and the eyes darted around the room in a dizzying blur, making my head spin. Like it was the first time they could ever see. Using the palms of my hands so I didn’t pop more orbs, I crawled my way over to the coffee table, desperate to call the salesman. I could feel more and more eyes form all over my body. I could feel them mixed in with the hair on my scalp, on the inside of my armpits, between my toes, but when my tongue flicked over the front of my incisors, I could feel an eye forming on the front of each tooth. The eyelashes loosely clung to their sockets and trickled into my throat as I felt around. I did the only thing I could think of. I screamed. I screamed and screamed and screamed until the light faded out of all my eyes.

When I awoke, I was looking through a thousand eyes at once. A thousand images clashing into each other like a thousand memories happening at once. But these weren’t memories; this was all happening now. With a shaking hand, I felt over every inch of my body. There wasn’t a spot that wasn’t covered in an oozing eyeball, looking around in a panic, even my hand searching my body had eyes. When my hand and body touched each other, I could see and feel the eyes colliding and swapping the slime with each other. But I couldn’t just see what was in my room; I could see everything. The neighbor walking their dog outside, a plane flying over my house, a star going through a supernova. I could see it all. I have looked at every square inch of the universe, scanning every little detail. Every little galaxy, every glacier melting, every bus stopping at a red light. As I gazed into every atom of the universe, my body lay on the rotting floor of my living room. I will never stop looking until I find what I am looking for. 

I have seen everything, a god in a mortal shell, but I will never be able to see Jane.

I had thought I had endometriosis previously, and I was shocked when I found out I had polycystic ovaries after an ultrasound. I got bloodwork done and my thyroid was normal, but my testosterone indicated PCOS (I'm batting 3/3 diagnostic criteria) and my A1C indicated I'm prediabetic. I'm on the combo pill and just started metformin today. 

I just feel really, really lost right now. I don't know how to process it all. I have known something was wrong for about a decade, but couldn't get any help. I got my first period at 11 and started having depression and anxiety immediately. The acne started when I was younger and over the years I developed a lot of facial hair, dark skin spots, and skin tags. My periods were completely irregular until I went on horomonal birth control. I've never had any sense of normalcy with that until the past 6 months. Suddenly all of the symptoms make sense. 

I know the birth control is called a bandaid treatment by a lot of people, but for right now it's helping regulate my period while I try to process everything and figure out what to do. And keeps me from getting pregnant before I'm ready to try. The amount of information and advice online is really overwhelming. I feel like my life changed overnight and I don't know what to do. 

It feels like PCOS has affected every part of my body and has destroyed me. At first, I was so relieved to have a possible diagnosis and a confirmation that it wasn't all in my head and then I realized the reality of it all and I've been struggling ever since. I don't know how to explain to anyone how deflated I feel. This feels like something I will always have to fight and that I will never be fully healthy ever again. 

I feel so embarrassed of being prediabetic and I know I shouldn't because it's part of being insulin resistant and having family history of it. I've always been overweight and struggled with it. It gives reason to why I've struggled so much, but it doesn't make it easier.

I'm terrified for what comes next. I have no idea how long I'll be on metformin, or how successful I'll be with managing all of this, or how my quality of life will be in 5 or 10 years. I feel like I'm going to be a burden to the people around me because of all of this, especially while I'm trying to figure it all out.

I'm only 22. I just started my master's degree. I'm working in a field I love and don't want to give it up. My boyfriend and I have been talking about marriage and I'm scared I won't be able to have kids. I'm scared my future isn't as bright as I was hoping and that I'll be fighting to make my body act and feel normal for the rest of my life.

I just needed a space where I could rant to people who understand. I'm just trying to take this one day at a time right now. I'm making small changes in my everyday life like drinking more water and not having coffee until I've eaten breakfast and eating less sugar and snacks. But it's all really overwhelming and I don't have the means or the energy to change everything I need to right now.

Hey,

I know this is a long shot and I don’t really have expectations, but I’m curious to see what happens after posting here :)

I’m married and have been ENM for about 4 years now. It’s definitely had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been a positive experience that’s helped me grow a lot.

I’m mostly looking for a friendship with a woman in a similar situation—someone who gets the lifestyle, the nuance, and the importance of honesty. I really enjoy connecting with people who are thoughtful, open-minded, and genuine.

A bit about me: I’m very into science, love wandering through art exhibitions, enjoy hiking and bodyboarding, and I’m always down for a cute coffee date with good conversation. I’m also really into tarot—so if you like exploring the intuitive side of things, that’s a bonus.

If any of this resonates with you, and you’re 30+ and in my area (and able to verify), feel free to send me a chat request. Would love to see if there’s a natural vibe ❤️",1,1766468926.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

I made around 100k, but I spent close to 110k. About 30k of that was loans. Rent was about 24k for the year, so those felt locked in. After loans, the biggest leak was food and daily supplies. Takeout, coffee, snacks, plus paper towels, detergent, and cleaners. It drained my cash like a slow leak.

This year I started with what I could control. For food, I cut random orders and rotated a few quick meals. I would rather eat the same thing than decide from scratch every day. For supplies, I switched to a strict list and only restock what I actually use. I also moved to a cheaper apartment that is a bit farther from work. My rent dropped from $2,500 to $1,800, so by this December I saved about $8,000 on housing. I am still paying loans and it is not easy, but the system is working. Cutting takeout helped too and over a year it saved me a little over $3,000. For supplies, sometimes I use that slashing game on TikTok to get items for free, or I look in TikTok Shop for end of year clearance basics, and that added up to \~$2,000 saved.

On top of that, I think I also got a bit lucky. I started investing part of what I saved into an ETF every month starting in March. So far this year it is up \~$6,000.

1ptm5wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ptm5wb/the_flatland_incident/,The Flatland Incident,"My grandpa died a long time ago, way before I was born, and I know next to nothing about him. I don’t know what he did for work, where he grew up, not even if he had siblings or was an only child. My dad doesn’t like to talk about him and I’ve learned that it’s often best to avoid the subject entirely when possible. So when I learned that we still owned grandpa’s house, and not only that, that it’s been left untouched for all these years. That it’s exactly the same as the last day he was alive. I saw an opportunity for myself– for us.

I genuinely think that it was never dad’s intention to keep the house a secret. That he always planned on cleaning it out one day and selling it but that something always got in the way. When it comes to grandpa, dad just can’t face his passing head on. So the house stood untouched for years, and then decades, until he let it slip to me that it existed at all.

I thought it would be a good idea for me to go to the house alone to fill a box with things that have sentimental value. Think photos, cards, maybe a watch, that kind of stuff. Things that you can tell right when you look at them were cared for and cherished. I thought that if I brought a box of these things back to my dad, maybe I could help him get closure. Maybe he’d open up a little and talk about grandpa more. Maybe that would be the first box of many as we cleared out the rest of the house together. I was hopeful.

The house was in an old rundown neighborhood. Most of the houses on the street were vacant too, so oddly enough, grandpa’s house didn’t feel out of place. Like after he died the street ceased to have a purpose, so it was frozen in time. I don’t know. What I’m trying to get at is that the house didn’t feel like it belonged to a dead man. It didn’t feel abandoned. It felt like it was in good company, and it looked cared for, even though the grass and weeds in the front lawn had waged war against the sidewalk and won. It felt welcoming to me, even though I knew there was nothing to be welcomed to.

When I got to the front door I almost rang the doorbell. That’s how normal this house felt. I caught myself and instead reached inside my breast pocket for the old brass key, the key I had to fight tooth and nail to get, and slowly unlocked the front door.

It was like walking into a memory, except the memory wasn’t mine. Golden light streamed in from the windows painting the space with a warm sepia. Everything was covered in an inch of dust, and it smelled– well it smelled like what I imagine grandpa smelled like: mothballs, smoke, and books. It felt like opening a time capsule, everything left exactly as it must have been decades earlier. A book on the coffee table left open and face down on the last page grandpa read. A now empty water glass neatly placed on an ornate coaster next to it. A quilt left in a scrunched pile on the ground.

I wondered if grandpa would have left the house any differently if he'd known he was going to die that day. Would he have tried to finish his book. Would he have folded his quilt and put it away instead of leaving it in a pile at the foot of the couch. I don't know. I have no idea what he would have done if he had the chance. I don't even know what he did when he was alive.

I noticed a shoe rack by the door and before I could realize the absurdity of what I was doing I had already taken off both of my shoes and placed them next to an old scuffed pair of brown boots. It just felt wrong to do anything else in that house before taking my shoes off.

I noticed that the walls had a light green floral wallpaper. I never imagined grandpa would have wallpaper like this. It was in great condition too, no sign of peeling anywhere. I think grandpa would be proud if he could see it now. I know dad would be talking about the craftsmanship, how it was superior to anything you could get done nowadays. I scanned the walls for pictures. There were many of dad when he was little. Him on a tricycle. Him with his face covered with ice cream. Him celebrating his fourth birthday. Him winning the science fair. I finally found a picture of both him and grandpa with dad wearing a T-ball uniform. It must have been taken after his first game. I gently took it off the wall and placed it in the box I had brought with me. That was the first photo I had seen with grandpa in it since– I don’t even remember how long. I tried to drink in the space. Tried to know grandpa by what he left behind.

I walked from the living room into the kitchen. It was a mess, but in a way that was very familiar. Organized chaos. I already knew the system like the back of my hand because dad still uses it. I know where all the silverware was kept, all the good silverware too. I know where the plates were and that they were in the opposite direction of the bowls, “so that they don’t conspire against us.” I know that each measuring cup is kept in a separate drawer, because– well to be honest I don’t know why and dad doesn’t either. It’s just something we do.

I opened the cabinet where I knew grandpa would have kept his favorite mug and like clockwork there it was, an old chipped “World’s Best Dad” mug. It was “well loved”, that’s what dad likes to say when something really isn’t worth keeping around. But there it was. I gingerly took it in my hands and placed it in the box. I did a quick once-over in the kitchen, but decided it was wise to leave the fridge and pantry closed. I noticed pill bottles on the counter. I picked one up and realized that they were full of caffeine pills. I don’t know how grandpa died, or even how old he was when he died, so I just assumed they must have been for some old person problem I hadn't heard about. I didn't give them much of a second thought.

I walked to the second floor staircase. After walking up the stairs I opened the door to what I assumed was dad’s old room. I wasn’t entirely sure because unlike the rest of the house it was completely empty. The only thing in the room was a neatly made twin size bed. There was nothing on the walls and unlike the walls downstairs these were white and plain. The curtains were drawn closed so the room was dark and musty. There was nothing to take because this room had already been cleared out ages ago. I already knew dad had moved out before grandpa died, but it felt weird to see for some reason. Like something was missing.

As I mulled over that thought, I moved from dad’s old bedroom down the hallway, passing the bathroom and taking the first left into grandpa’s study. This room couldn’t be more different from dad’s. Every inch of the walls was covered with pictures and newspaper clippings. They were so covered I couldn’t tell what color the wallpaper was, if there was wallpaper at all. I made a beeline straight for the desk. It was a mountain of papers and letters. I found an old Father’s day card dad must’ve made tucked in a corner of the desk, where base camp would have been, and snatched it for my growing collection. 

I felt like I could learn a lot about grandpa from his desk. It was a mess. Papers on papers, piling up in defined layers like sedimentary rock. The only clean part of his desk was the inner right corner where there was a small packed ash tray with a vintage zippo lighter next to it. I took those as well, more for me than for dad. I opened the one drawer attached to the underside of the desk and surprisingly enough it was almost empty. There was only one thing in the drawer: a wedding ring. When I picked it up it felt heavy in my hand. I wondered why grandpa took his ring off. Dad never takes his ring off, not even all these years after. 

I looked over the desk a little more closely. It felt wrong reading someone else’s papers, but grandpa’s dead so I didn’t think he'd mind. Most of it was pretty ordinary anyway, like taxes and junk mail, except for one thing. There was a sealed letter on the top of the pile with my dad’s name on it. No address information, just the name. Like the ring, it felt heavy in my hands. I wondered how dad would feel when he saw this. I wondered if he wanted to read it at all. I put it in the box alongside the ring.

At this point I felt like I had got enough for one trip, so I left the study ready to make my way back to the front door. Then I noticed something at the end of the hallway, past the study. The attic ladder was down. I don’t know how I missed it before but it was unmistakable now. It was getting pretty late at this point, the sepia was slowly turning to noir, but I was overcome with a sudden urge to check the attic, if only for a minute, before leaving. I wish I had left and never looked back.",3,1766468830.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1766468805.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1ptm2iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ptm2iq/advice_breakup_situation/,Advice - Breakup situation,"I met a guy on app. For hookups. From the beginning, there was strong mutual attraction and sex was great. and later he asked me after 2 weeks if I would be open for something serious and I said yes.

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you. 

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.


I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me 

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness.
We got back together 

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.


I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

It’s been three years since I lost my vision. I know this because I have felt the cold touch of winter three times since then. Losing my vision is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. It would be one thing if I were born without vision, but losing it in my late thirties only added to my midlife spiral. This spiral continued until 7:30 AM this morning, when I was offered an experimental drug that would gain some of my vision back. I was a little weary at first. I have never been one to take risks, even when I could see, but what more do I have to lose?

The knocking at the door woke me up from my inky slumber. An avalanche of beer cans crashed to the floor as I hobbled to my feet. How did I fall asleep in the recliner again? As I used my hand against the wall to guide me to the door, I could feel the aging wood moan, its many years of decay now crying out as it rotted in place. The person on the other side of the door didn’t stop knocking until I flung the door open. “What do you want?” I croaked out. “Good morning, sir! Sorry for waking you, but I have an offer you can’t refuse!” The man on the other side of the veil was too energetic for my liking; his tone sounded like he was holding back excitement over something I didn’t know. As he spoke, I could smell yesterday’s cigarettes and this morning's mint, which failed to mask the ashy scent. I was able to reply with “Just spill it already, I am a busy man” before the man chuckled. “Oh, I know you are, sir, but I have an offer of a lifetime. How would you like to be one of the first people on this planet to try our new miracle drug, Helio?” The man paused after excitedly spilling out his words, almost like he knew what he was going to say next. “Why would I try a 'miracle' drug? There’s no such thing, now get the hell off my porch before I-” But before I could finish slurring my words, the man cut me off. “I know this sounds too good to be true, but I can confirm it works! One pill of Helio is all you need to be able to see and more! Plus, if that doesn’t sway you, we are offering $15,000 to anyone willing to try”. I snorted and replied, “Oh, what bullshit”. As I started to close the door, it was suddenly stopped by a hand slamming on the door. The salesman was closer to me than expected. “Steven, I know about the accident. What more can you lose? We pay upfront, so even if it doesn’t work, you will still have the money to do whatever you like. Think about it.” After a few beats of silence, the man stepped back and started to walk away. It took me a moment to contemplate the choice: do I want to risk my life to take a drug that would probably fuck my life up, or do I want to continue my life in the dark? But at this point, what life was I even living?  “Wait, let me see the money first,” I called to him before he was out of earshot. The man let out a soft chuckle as tootsteps quickly rushed up the porch steps before placing a stack of newly printed money in my outstretched hand. The money felt crisp in the palm of my hand. Even though I wasn’t sure if it was the right amount of money, I didn’t care enough to be sure. “Listen, I will take the pill, but if anything goes wrong-” The man cut me off once again. “It won’t.” He said in a stern voice, the first time he was serious in the whole conversation. I felt the pill drop into my hand. It was slightly squishy, like the skin of a newborn. “Pleasure doing business with you, and here is my card”.

As I stumbled back into the living room, I considered even taking the pill at all. I could just take the money and throw the pill away. But as I was walking to the kitchen, I knocked a picture off the wall. The shattering of the glass was louder than I expected. I knew what that photo was; it was my wife and me on our wedding day. I can still remember what her dress looked like. The white dress flowed like a river as she walked down the aisle. If only I could hold her one more time. But I could see her picture one more time…..

“Fuck it,” I picked up a half-empty beer can on the floor and slammed the beer and pill without a second thought. After a few moments of standing in the darkness… nothing happened. “Miracle drug my ass.” As I was about to put the can in the recycling bin, a flutter of light crept into my vision, blinding me out of my eternal darkness. This was the first streak of light I have seen in years. Slowly, like an old TV being turned on, my kitchen became visibly in a static haze. I was able to look around and see my kitchen for the first time since the accident that took more away from me than I could ever have thought was possible.  The kitchen was covered in years' worth of garbage. I could always smell the heaping mound of trash scattered around, but I never gave it much thought since I couldn’t see it. “Holy shit,” I couldn’t believe it worked. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes. Without warning, part of my vision went back into the inky prison. I could still see my surroundings, but I could also see a black void. My mind was racing to figure out what was happening, but I got my answer before I figured it out. On my lower back near my waist line, I felt something….blink. Quickly, I felt around on my back until I poked it. The pain was excruciating; it felt like I got poked in the eye. Half in pain and confused, I stumbled into the bathroom. The man in the mirror was different than the last time I saw him. His eyes were bloodshot, like they had seen a world of pain, even though this was the first time they could see anything in a long time. All the light that used to radiate from him was now gone and replaced with a husk that oozed darkness. I spun around to find the painful spot on my back but as I lifted my shirt, I wished I had never done so. There, on my lower back, in between a brown mole and the back hair, was an eyeball. The eye was covered in a light coat of slime similar to a newborn baby. The eye was yellowed with the iris being a striking blue, which was different from my natural brown eyes. I screamed the second I saw it, backing away from the mirror. But what confused me more than anything was that I could see through it. It was like looking at a computer with multiple windows open. I could see through the eyes on my head, but also through the one on my back. 

I left the bathroom in a blur. I had to find the card to call the salesman back. As I rounded the corner into the living room, I felt a loud POP on the bottom of my left foot. Pain shot through my body like lightning as I crashed to the floor like a chopped-down tree. Through gritted teeth, I turned my foot towards me to get a look at what I stepped on. Only I didn’t step on anything that was scattered on the floor. Instead, I put all of my weight on a fresh new eyeball that formed on the bottom of my foot. The splattered eye pooled in a pond of blood as it hung on the crumbled optic nerve still connected to the inside of my foot. The new eye socket was less than 20 millimeters wide and oozed a milky white liquid. The white liquid and blood flowed into each other but refused to mix together, like oil and water. As I reached my hand to my foot, I could see my face looking back at me through one of my new eyes, which was now located on my right fingernail. I watched in disbelief as each of my fingernails split in the center to create an eye. Each time a new orb broke through the layer of skin, I was able to see through it, and the eyes darted around the room in a dizzying blur, making my head spin. Like it was the first time they could ever see. Using the palms of my hands so I didn’t pop more orbs, I crawled my way over to the coffee table, desperate to call the salesman. I could feel more and more eyes form all over my body. I could feel them mixed in with the hair on my scalp, on the inside of my armpits, between my toes, but when my tongue flicked over the front of my incisors, I could feel an eye forming on the front of each tooth. The eyelashes loosely clung to their sockets and trickled into my throat as I felt around. I did the only thing I could think of. I screamed. I screamed and screamed and screamed until the light faded out of all my eyes.

When I awoke, I was looking through a thousand eyes at once. A thousand images clashing into each other like a thousand memories happening at once. But these weren’t memories; this was all happening now. With a shaking hand, I felt over every inch of my body. There wasn’t a spot that wasn’t covered in an oozing eyeball, looking around in a panic, even my hand searching my body had eyes. When my hand and body touched each other, I could see and feel the eyes colliding and swapping the slime with each other. But I couldn’t just see what was in my room; I could see everything. The neighbor walking their dog outside, a plane flying over my house, a star going through a supernova. I could see it all. I have looked at every square inch of the universe, scanning every little detail. Every little galaxy, every glacier melting, every bus stopping at a red light. As I gazed into every atom of the universe, my body lay on the rotting floor of my living room. I will never stop looking until I find what I am looking for. 

I have seen everything, a god in a mortal shell, but I will never be able to see Jane.

I went out of the office with my phone and then saw her, walked up to her and asked her about something related to her speaking French.

We chatted and *she asked me for my name*, I was about to go in and she said that would be good to continue chatting at a different time.

We just said hi from there on at the office (we work at different companies).

I was waiting for a signal from her, and what she did was stretching her leg over the other side of the table, touched my leg for 2 seconds and then removed it.

Is that enough to make a move again?

I am thinking about chatting again and asking her for coffee (her boss is in the same office 😂😂).

I will leave the cowork soon but wanted to try my shot before leaving.

This was the first streak of light I have seen in years. Slowly, like an old TV being turned on, my kitchen became visibly in a static haze. I was able to look around and see my kitchen for the first time since the accident that took more away from me than I could ever have thought was possible.  The kitchen was covered in years' worth of garbage. I could always smell the heaping mound of trash scattered around, but I never gave it much thought since I couldn’t see it. “Holy shit,” I couldn’t believe it worked. I could feel the tears well up in my eyes. Without warning, part of my vision went back into the inky prison. I could still see my surroundings, but I could also see a black void. My mind was racing to figure out what was happening, but I got my answer before I figured it out. On my lower back near my waist line, I felt something….blink. Quickly, I felt around on my back until I poked it. The pain was excruciating; it felt like I got poked in the eye. Half in pain and confused, I stumbled into the bathroom. The man in the mirror was different than the last time I saw him. His eyes were bloodshot, like they had seen a world of pain, even though this was the first time they could see anything in a long time. All the light that used to radiate from him was now gone and replaced with a husk that oozed darkness. I spun around to find the painful spot on my back but as I lifted my shirt, I wished I had never done so. There, on my lower back, in between a brown mole and the back hair, was an eyeball. The eye was covered in a light coat of slime similar to a newborn baby. The eye was yellowed with the iris being a striking blue, which was different from my natural brown eyes. I screamed the second I saw it, backing away from the mirror. But what confused me more than anything was that I could see through it. It was like looking at a computer with multiple windows open. I could see through the eyes on my head, but also through the one on my back. 

I left the bathroom in a blur. I had to find the card to call the salesman back. As I rounded the corner into the living room, I felt a loud POP on the bottom of my left foot. Pain shot through my body like lightning as I crashed to the floor like a chopped-down tree. Through gritted teeth, I turned my foot towards me to get a look at what I stepped on. Only I didn’t step on anything that was scattered on the floor. Instead, I put all of my weight on a fresh new eyeball that formed on the bottom of my foot. The splattered eye pooled in a pond of blood as it hung on the crumbled optic nerve still connected to the inside of my foot. The new eye socket was less than 20 millimeters wide and oozed a milky white liquid. The white liquid and blood flowed into each other but refused to mix together, like oil and water. As I reached my hand to my foot, I could see my face looking back at me through one of my new eyes, which was now located on my right fingernail. I watched in disbelief as each of my fingernails split in the center to create an eye. Each time a new orb broke through the layer of skin, I was able to see through it, and the eyes darted around the room in a dizzying blur, making my head spin. Like it was the first time they could ever see. Using the palms of my hands so I didn’t pop more orbs, I crawled my way over to the coffee table, desperate to call the salesman. I could feel more and more eyes form all over my body. I could feel them mixed in with the hair on my scalp, on the inside of my armpits, between my toes, but when my tongue flicked over the front of my incisors, I could feel an eye forming on the front of each tooth. The eyelashes loosely clung to their sockets and trickled into my throat as I felt around. I did the only thing I could think of. I screamed. I screamed and screamed and screamed until the light faded out of all my eyes.

When I awoke, I was looking through a thousand eyes at once. A thousand images clashing into each other like a thousand memories happening at once. But these weren’t memories; this was all happening now. With a shaking hand, I felt over every inch of my body. There wasn’t a spot that wasn’t covered in an oozing eyeball, looking around in a panic, even my hand searching my body had eyes. When my hand and body touched each other, I could see and feel the eyes colliding and swapping the slime with each other. But I couldn’t just see what was in my room; I could see everything. The neighbor walking their dog outside, a plane flying over my house, a star going through a supernova. I could see it all. I have looked at every square inch of the universe, scanning every little detail. Every little galaxy, every glacier melting, every bus stopping at a red light. As I gazed into every atom of the universe, my body lay on the rotting floor of my living room. I will never stop looking until I find what I am looking for. 

I have seen everything, a god in a mortal shell, but I will never be able to see Jane.

I’ll be going back to my home country in a few weeks as the semester ends. I went out clubbing with some friends a few days ago to celebrate the end of finals. While there I met this guy (26M). We really hit it off, and spent the rest of the night talking and dancing together, and both agreed that we would have liked to go on some dates if I weren’t leaving so soon. 

To keep a long story short, I went back to his place because I wanted to spend more time with him. We didn’t do anything that night, since I made it clear I was wasn’t going back to his place just to hook up, so we just kinda talked and went to sleep. By morning I felt really comfortable around him, and idk I guess I figured I’ve never done this kind of thing before, and I wanted to try it, so I slept with him. It wasn’t awkward afterwards. We had lunch and got coffee then I went home. 

I’m not looking for a relationship, to be clear. Long distance is a bitch and it wouldn’t really be fair to either of us. Maybe I’m naive, but I was hoping we could still keep in touch because we had good conversations and seemed to have a lot of mutual interests. Plus I come back to this country quite frequently and he said he wants to visit my home country. Not like close close friends or anything but, idk ‘hey I’m in the area, wanna grab coffee’ people.
 
It’s been like two days, but I was planning to text him asking about recommendations for places to go in a city I’m visiting (which he had gone to a few times before). But I feel very awkward about this whole thing now. I don’t know the etiquette. And if we hadn’t slept together, I wouldn’t have an issue, because it’s like easier to get over/ignore mutual attraction from the club, but technically it’s a one night stand so it’s different i guess.

She was in second-year college when she decided the world had an expiration date.

Seven years.

That number followed her everywhere, it etched into every thought, every plan, every quiet moment. Pollution, waste, greed, careless leadership—humanity had done too much damage. If the earth’s maximum is seven years, she has even less.

The math haunted her.
Finish college.
Then work.
Then save.
Then build the business she had dreamed about since freshman year.
But what was the point?
There wouldn’t be enough time to grow it. Not enough time to succeed.

There is no time.

Every effort felt meaningless when the future itself seemed borrowed. Hope became impractical. Having dreams felt embarrassing. So she lived on pause. Her notebook stayed half-empty, assignments went unfinished, coffee grew cold on her desk. Planning felt hollow, hope impossible. She was existing, but not really living.

Hopeless.

Until one voice broke through the noise.
What if success didn’t need more than seven years?
What if, instead of mourning the end, she treated the next seven years as a challenge? Not longevity but intensity. Not “someday”but “how far can I go before time runs out?”
Faith whispered an answer she hadn’t allowed herself to hear: ""you could still try"". Even if tomorrow wasn’t guaranteed, today was. Even if the world ended, she could live fully in the time she had.
She rewrote her deadline.
If the world had seven years left, she would become her best self within them. She would build anyway. Dream anyway. Work anyway. Love anyway. Ecen if tomorrow isn't promised—but because she was alive today.
In a few days, that girl would start her seven-year journey. 

That girl is me.

I work a typical 9–5 corporate job, with long screen hours, meetings stacked back-to-back, irregular lunch timing, and the usual cycle of coffee → crash → snack → guilt. I’ve been getting more curious about Ayurveda, especially the idea of *kitchen Ayurveda*—using simple food habits and spices to support energy, digestion, and mental clarity.

Most Ayurveda content I find feels either too traditional (multiple daily rituals, long prep times) or too vague to apply when you’re rushing out the door or eating at your desk.

So I’m wondering:

* Has anyone here actually adapted Ayurvedic principles to a modern corporate schedule?
* What are a few realistic kitchen habits that work on weekdays?
* Any simple breakfast/lunch ideas that don’t require waking up an hour early?
* How do you handle coffee, late lunches, or stress eating from an Ayurvedic lens?

Not looking to be “perfect” with it, just practical ways to feel less drained and more balanced while working full-time.

Retailers that depend heavily on imported items said they already feel the impact of the strong exchange rate on some product categories.  
   
“We import most of our raw materials, and since we can’t easily replace coffee beans with domestic ones, it’s nearly impossible to diversify sourcing,” a representative from a food company said. “That’s why the rising exchange rate hits us hard.”  
   
A representative of a confectionery maker also said that imported ingredients like wheat and corn heavily influence product prices and that the company expects its profit margins to decline.  
   
“We are trying to spread out our purchases over time to defend against rising exchange rates,” the representative said.  
   
When indexed to 100 in 2020, the import price index for coffee in November stood at 307.12 in dollar terms and 379.71 in won terms, nearly quadrupling over the past five years, according to the BOK's Economic Statistics System. Corn prices rose 6 percent in dollar terms and 35 percent in won terms in November. Wheat prices fell about 2 percent in dollar terms but rose 22 percent in won terms.

Convenience store chains have already begun raising prices on food and beverages.  
   
Korea Seven, which operates the 7-Eleven chain, said it will raise prices on about 40 private brand items from Jan. 1, 2026, with increases of about 5 to 25 percent. GS Retail, which operates GS25 stores, said it will also raise prices on four private brand items next year.  
   
“The decision to increase prices was unavoidable because labor and raw material costs have risen and suppliers are under increasing strain,” a convenience store industry representative said.

Posting the full piece below in case it’s useful t to those here 🙂

[**My 2026 Resolution: Don’t Die**](https://curalysis.com/blog/my-2026-resolution-dont-die)

The end of the year tends to invite reflection. Resolutions. A quiet reset.

For most people, New Year’s resolutions are about getting fitter, eating better, sleeping more, or finally taking health seriously. For people living with ALS or MND, the framing is different. The question is not how to optimise health. It is how to preserve function, slow decline where possible, and protect quality of life for as long as you can.

Before going any further, I want to acknowledge the title. “Don’t Die” is deliberately blunt, and I know it may land differently for different people. For some caregivers and families who have already lost someone to ALS or MND, it may feel confronting or even flippant. That isn’t my intent. When you live with a terminal diagnosis, death stops being an abstract concept and becomes part of the daily landscape. Dark humour, blunt language, and even a little hyperbole are often how we cope. For me, “Don’t Die” isn’t about denying reality or disrespecting loss. It’s about refusing to disengage from life while I’m still here. If the phrasing feels uncomfortable, I hope the spirit behind it comes through as you read on.

I also want to acknowledge that not everyone wants to fight a disease like this, and that choice is just as valid. For many people, focusing on comfort, presence, and living well with the function they have is the right path. This article is written for those who feel driven to push back, to experiment, and to stay actively engaged for as long as they can.

I want to be clear up front. What I’m about to share takes time, money, support, and energy. I know many people simply don’t have access to those things. Some don’t have caregivers. Some don’t have the physical capacity. Some don’t have the financial room to experiment. I don’t take for granted that I’m in a relatively privileged position, even while living with a diagnosis I would never have chosen.

I’m sharing this not as a blueprint, a recommendation, or a benchmark. I’m sharing it because people keep asking what my days actually look like. What I’m taking. What I’m trying to support metabolically. What has become routine. And why. I also want to be clear about the risks of simply copying someone else’s stack without understanding your own context, history, and trade offs, something I’ve written about before when exploring the [dark side of supplements and off label treatments](https://curalysis.com/blog/dark-side-of-supplements-and-off-label-treatments).

I’ve taken inspiration from the broader idea behind the “Don’t Die” mindset, not in the sense of chasing perfection, but in the sense of refusing to be passive. Of building systems around health. Of measuring what you can. Of doing what is within reach, even when the system offers very little beyond decline tracking. You may have heard this framing through the [work of Bryan Johnson](https://www.bryanjohnson.com) and his focus on radical longevity and measurement. My version is far less polished, far less controlled, and shaped by the constraints of a terminal illness, but the underlying idea is similar. Stay engaged. Measure what matters. Keep showing up.

This article is a snapshot. My current routine. Where I’ve come from. What I’m trying to support. And why.

**Why Metabolic Health Became My Focus After Diagnosis**

After my diagnosis, metabolic health stopped being an abstract idea and became something very real. It was the reality check I needed to get my act together.

ALS strips away the illusion that you can ignore your health and get away with it. Once you’re living with a condition that actively degrades muscle, energy, and function, the question becomes simple. How do you support the systems that are still working for as long as possible.

For me, that meant focusing on energy production, resilience, and recovery. Mitochondrial function. Metabolic flexibility. Sleep quality. Inflammation. Gut health, which became an increasing focus as I dug into the [emerging links between the microbiome and neurodegeneration](https://curalysis.com/blog/the-gut-the-brain-and-als-what-the-microbiome-might-be-trying-to-tell-us). Not because any one of these is a cure, but because together they shape how the body copes with stress and decline.

ALS also forced me to confront things many of us can ignore for years. Poor sleep. Constant stress. Ultra processed food. Artificial light. Inactivity. I don’t believe these factors act in isolation, but I do believe that for some people, environmental and lifestyle stressors [may contribute to ALS risk and influence how the disease unfolds](https://curalysis.com/blog/a-conspiracy-of-genes-environment-and-time-how-als-takes-hold).

The medical system doesn’t offer much guidance here. You get told what can’t be done far more clearly than what can. So I started asking a different question. If decline is expected, what might help slow it. What might protect quality of life. What might give me more usable time.

That clarity shaped what I’m actually aiming for. I’m not chasing optimisation or peak performance. I’m trying to slow loss where possible, preserve function, and protect quality of life. I want to stay mobile for as long as I can. I want to keep eating, speaking, breathing, and thinking clearly. I want to reduce secondary issues like cramping, fatigue, sleep disruption, and anxiety, because those things compound quickly.

Some of these goals are measurable. Others aren’t. Some days are better than others. But having clear intent helps me decide what to prioritise and what to let go. Without that context, the routine that follows can look arbitrary. With it, it becomes easier to understand why my days are structured the way they are.

**A Snapshot of Where I’m At and How I Got Here**

The first symptom I noticed was muscle twitching in January 2024. At the time it didn’t feel significant. It was easy to ignore. By May, I started having dexterity issues in one finger. Soon after that came balance changes, subtle voice abnormalities, and a level of fatigue that felt out of proportion to what I was doing.

[I was diagnosed on the 18th of October 2024](https://curalysis.com/blog/have-you-heard-of-als). By then, my ALSFRS R score was 36 out of 48. No single function had taken a major hit, but many areas were affected a little.

In January 2025, my score was 35. By mid year it had dropped to 34. In December 2025, my neurologist adjusted it back up to 35. On paper, I’ll likely finish the year close to where I started.

The reality is more complicated.

The ALSFRS-R scale can allow for quite a lot of real world decline without a change in score. In January this year, I could walk outside unaided for several kilometres. I tired more quickly than before, but I was still mobile. By May, I needed a hiking stick and could manage one to two kilometres with support.

Over the months that followed, my balance deteriorated further. Now, when I’m outside, I need a walker. For longer trips I use a wheelchair. Inside the house I can still walk unaided most of the time. Overnight, when I’m groggy, I use hiking poles to get to and from the bathroom safely.

So while I haven’t lost many points on the scale, my day to day reality has changed significantly.

That said, I’m grateful. Progression appears relatively slow compared to the averages. I can’t prove that my routines, supplements, or therapies are responsible for that. There’s no way to know for certain. But I do believe they could be contributing, and that belief is enough to keep me engaged and paying attention.

**Morning to Night: What a Typical Day Looks Like**

Most mornings my alarm goes off at 7.15am.

I sleep in an electric bed and keep my legs raised overnight. That has helped reduce cramping. Beside the bed I have a rail that I use when I need support getting up, especially on mornings where my balance feels off.

I usually shower first. After that, my morning routine begins.

I use a [red light therapy device](https://curalysis.com/blog/red-light-therapy-and-als-hype-hope-or-both) on my gut and head for about ten minutes. While that’s running, I take my morning medications and supplements.

After that I head to the recumbent bike and do around 1.5 kilometres. It only takes a few minutes. It’s not about fitness. It’s about gently stretching my legs and getting things moving.

Breakfast comes next. I won’t go into detail here as I’ve written separately about [my ketogenic approach and why it makes sense for me](https://curalysis.com/blog/ketogenic-diet-and-als-my-take-not-a-prescription). Mornings are structured and predictable.

Most days I’ll have a coffee. Other than one coffee per day, all I drink is filtered water with natural electrolytes.

Once the sun reaches our backyard, usually around 8.30am, I sit on the back deck if the weather allows. I aim for ten to thirty minutes of direct sunlight. During that time I stretch. Neck. Arms. Back. Legs. Fingers.

The rest of the morning is usually work time. Emails. Writing. Research. Curalysis work. I take regular breaks to stretch my fingers. That’s where my weakness first started, and they tend to rest in a slightly curved position now.

I drink a lot of water throughout the day and pay attention to hydration. Around lunchtime I take my midday medication and eat lunch, then return to work.

On Tuesdays I have physiotherapy in the afternoon. We focus on balance, maintaining range of motion, and soft tissue work to reduce cramping. Every second Thursday I also have a hydrotherapy session. The water gives me back a sense of full range of motion and lets me practice movement and balance strategies safely.

In the evening I have dinner, and a couple of hours later I begin my night routine. I use a vagus nerve stimulation device for about thirty minutes while finishing up any remaining work. After that I use a red light therapy device again and aim for 3 kilometres on the recumbent bike.

I take my evening supplements. When it’s time for bed, I raise the legs on the bed, put on a sleep mask to block out light, and aim for a solid night of rest.

I also wear a hand splint overnight, usually on my right hand, sometimes alternating to the left. It helps prevent my fingers from curling while I sleep.

None of this is about perfection. It’s about structure. Reducing friction. Giving my body the best chance to recover and keep going into the next day.

**A Note on Capacity, Support, and Reality**

This routine takes time and a significant amount of effort. Right now, I’m managing most of it myself. I’m also very aware that in the future it will become much harder to keep up the same routines.

I’m fortunate to live in Australia, where the NDIS provides substantial support. Over time, that support will allow me to bring in support workers rather than trying to do everything on my own or leaning too heavily on my wife. I know many people in other countries do not have access to anything like this.

Because of that, routines like mine may not be realistic for everyone. They may not be possible if you don’t have support, or if a partner or family member doesn’t have the time or capacity to help. That doesn’t make the intent wrong. It just means the approach needs to change.

If you’re trying to build a routine like this, it may help to think about how to simplify it. Instead of two red light therapy and exercise sessions, maybe it’s one. Instead of doing everything every day, maybe it’s rotating focus across the week.

One thing I’ve learned is that planning matters more than volume. Grouping things that naturally fit together, or aligning routines with how your energy changes across the day, can make a real difference. It’s not about copying someone else’s day. It’s about shaping something that fits your limits and still moves you in the right direction.

**My Current Stack**

This is what I’m currently taking and using. It’s not advice. It’s not a protocol. It’s simply what I’ve arrived at after a lot of reading, discussion with clinicians, and trial and error.

**Medications**

**Ambroxol (clinical trial)**  
I’m taking this as part of a [clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05959850). It’s early science, but the safety profile is well understood.

**Nuedexta**  
This helps with speech. It doesn’t change the disease, but it makes day to day communication easier.

**CBD oil (broad spectrum)**  
This is about comfort. It helps with anxiety, sleep, and muscle tension, something I’ve written about before ([Cannabis, ALS, and the fight for relief](https://curalysis.com/blog/cannabis-als-and-the-fight-for-relief)).

**Supplements and Vitamins**

**Creatine**  
This is about energy buffering in muscle. It may help with fatigue and strength.

**Acetyl-L-Carnitine**  
Taken to support mitochondrial energy transport. The idea is simple. If neurons are energy stressed, [anything that supports that system may help](https://curalysis.com/blog/what-supplements-can-slow-als-progression).

**CoQ10**  
Another mitochondrial support. This one is about ATP production and oxidative stress.

**Nicotinamide Riboside with Pterostilbene**  
This is aimed at NAD levels and cellular energy. I’ve found my energy more consistent since adding it, even if the evidence base is still emerging.

**Benfotiamine and other B1 forms**  
This is about glucose metabolism and energy pathways. Thiamine plays a central role here, and high dose forms are being explored in neurodegenerative disease.

**Methylcobalamin (high dose B12)**  
This is one of the few supplements with regulatory approval for ALS in Japan. Though I take it as a sublingual tablet rather than injectible form.

**L-Methylfolate**  
This supports methylation and homocysteine balance. It’s not ALS specific, but it supports overall neurological health.

**Magnesium Glycinate**  
This helps with muscle relaxation, cramps, and sleep quality.

**Vitamin D3 with K2**  
This is about bone health, muscle function, and general resilience, especially with reduced mobility.

**Omega 3 (algae based DHA)**  
This supports neuronal membranes and helps keep inflammation in check.

**HMB**  
A target compound being explored by [Dr Richard Bedlack](https://curalysis.com/blog/dr-bedlack-and-the-64-als-reversals) and his team, as discussed further in [this piece on how a gym supplement ended up in my ALS research notes](https://curalysis.com/blog/how-a-gym-supplement-ended-up-in-my-als-research-notes).

**Black Seed Oil**  
This is primarily about inflammation and antioxidant support.

**L-Serine**  
This one relates to theories around excitotoxicity and amino acid balance. It’s experimental, but low risk.

**Urolithin A**  
Supporting mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. While most evidence comes from aging and muscle health research, the mechanism is relevant to energy stressed cells.

**Devices and Therapies**

**Recumbent Bike**  
This lets me move safely without balance risk. It’s about circulation, stretching, and keeping legs engaged.

**Walker and Wheelchair**  
They let me stay active, get outside, and conserve energy for what matters.

**Red Light Therapy**  
This is aimed at mitochondrial support and inflammation, and is something I continue to experiment with.

**Vagus Nerve Stimulation**  
This helps with relaxation and autonomic balance in the evenings.

**Physiotherapy (weekly)**  
Focused on balance, range of motion, and soft tissue work to reduce cramping.

**Hydrotherapy (fortnightly)**  
The water gives me back movement I don’t have on land. It’s one of the few places I still feel fluid.

**What I’ve Tried and Chosen to Stop**

Not everything I’ve tried has stayed in my routine. Some things helped for a while. Others created trade offs that eventually outweighed the benefits.

Early on, I took Baclofen to reduce the severe cramping I was getting in my legs overnight. It did help with the cramps, especially in my calves, which used to cramp painfully and wake me up. But over time it built up in my system. I started to feel more rigid overnight, almost locked into position. Although my muscles were technically more relaxed, my body felt stiffer overall and I was waking less rested. Eventually it was doing more harm than good, so I stopped.

I took Riluzole for the first twelve months post diagnosis. I didn’t notice many issues at first, but over time I became profoundly tired. I was crashing on the couch two or three afternoons a week and losing half a day at a time. Fatigue is listed as a side effect, and once I stopped it, my energy improved almost immediately. If I hadn’t experienced that side effect, I would have continued, but at that point it was clearly costing me more than it was giving.

I also trialled methylene blue for a short period. While there are interesting theories around mitochondrial support, I became concerned about its potential impact on the gut microbiome and decided to stop.

Earlier on, I also took a wide range of general antioxidants and anti-inflammatory supplements. Many of them weren’t particularly targeted to ALS mechanisms. They were things I’d picked up from other people’s documents and forums. Over time, I became more selective and focused on things that felt more specific and intentional.

Stopping things has been just as important as adding them. Less noise has made it easier to understand the direction I was aiming for.

**A Note on Mental Load**

Another thing I don’t do anymore, but may return to if I feel the need, is meditation.

Before all this, I never really connected with meditation. I found it boring and struggled to keep a routine. After diagnosis, though, my mind needed somewhere to land. I found a series called *The Gateway Tapes*, which explores altered states of consciousness.

I won’t try to explain or endorse it beyond my own experience. But during those early months, it helped me calm my mind, process the diagnosis, and come to terms with mortality in a way nothing else had.

I don’t use it now. I don’t need it in the same way. But I’m glad I had it when I did.

The mental load of ALS is real. Planning, tracking, adjusting, and thinking about the disease can be exhausting. Finding tools that help steady the mind, even temporarily, can be just as important as anything physical.

**What Success Looks Like for Me Right Now**

Success doesn’t mean things aren’t changing. They are. But it does mean some things are better than they were.

I have far fewer cramps now, particularly in my legs. The painful calf cramps that used to wake me overnight are much less frequent. Since starting the vagus nerve stimulation, I’ve noticed I’m dreaming much more often, which likely means my REM sleep is deeper or more consistent.

My energy through the day is steadier. I can sit at my desk for longer stretches. I get more meaningful work done. I feel mentally sharper and more present, rather than constantly running on empty.

On paper, the rate of decline on the functional scale has slowed compared to the year before diagnosis.

I want to be clear. There is no way for me to know for certain what is helping and what isn’t. But I do believe that some of the things I’m doing are likely contributing to slower progression and possibly extending my lifespan. That belief is grounded in observation, not certainty.

Success also looks like reduced anxiety. The background fear that arrived with diagnosis has eased. I feel more grounded. More able to live inside my days rather than constantly anticipating what comes next.

**Where This Leaves Me Now**

This is a living document. What you’ve read here reflects where I am now, not a finished state.

Early on, my routine and supplement list changed a lot. There was volatility. I was trying to understand what mattered and what didn’t. Over time that has settled. The number of changes I make now is much smaller. I still experiment occasionally. I’ll swap something out, add something that makes sense, or pause something that becomes too hard to sustain. But the core stays fairly stable.

Some days I skip things. If I’m short on time or energy, I might drop a session on the recumbent bike or miss a red light session. If it comes down to a choice, I prioritise sleep. A full night of rest does more for me than forcing in every last item on a checklist.

This routine didn’t appear overnight. It has built up gradually since diagnosis. I know that for someone newly diagnosed, reading something like this can feel daunting. That’s understandable. [If you want to fight](https://curalysis.com/blog/the-plan-i-wish-i-had-when-i-was-diagnosed-with-als), you don’t start by doing everything. You start by doing something.

That might mean choosing a small number of supplements that feel most relevant. Or introducing a simple stretching routine focused on the areas where you’re noticing change. Or thinking about what devices might help reduce risk or conserve energy. I’ve always found it more sustainable to work on one section at a time rather than trying to overhaul everything at once.

One thing I still believe strongly is the value of starting with a baseline. Even if it’s imperfect. Take stock of where you are. Think about the environmental, lifestyle, or exposure factors you suspect may have contributed. That gives you somewhere to begin. From there, you can test, adjust, and build, an approach that's more likely to work for you.

This isn’t about copying my routine. It’s about finding your own entry point. Small changes add up. And a plan, even a rough one, is better than none at all.

If you want to talk through blockers, alternatives, or simpler versions of any of this, I’ve linked a small private Facebook group below. I’m happy to answer questions and help where I can.

You don’t have to do everything. But you do have to start somewhere.

Which brings me back to the title. My New Year’s resolution is not to die in 2026. Not as denial or false confidence, but as a way of staying actively engaged with life while I’m still here. For those who feel the same pull to keep fighting, I hope you’ll join me in whatever way makes sense for you.",1,1766466302.0,mnd,0,1.0,False

1ptlbs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ptlbs7/scarlet_stairs/,Scarlet Stairs,"My father and I were sitting on the porch in the late summer. The Florida heat lingered in the air as the sky burned pink and orange. The woods across the property buzzed with insects, and the humidity made the windows sweat with moisture. Dad sat in his chair with a half-burned cigarette at the corner of his mouth. It was our daily ritual.

He worked a lot, always had my entire life, so these porch talks were something I cherished. We could spend hours out there, discussing anything: history, politics, religion, values, women problems. He always comes off harsh, but he is the kind of man you can talk to about anything. As the sun sank behind the trees and the air finally began to cool, the conversation drifted, as it often did, to old places we’d lived.

There were many of them. He moved a lot when I was young. Military. Work. A second marriage. I don’t remember most of those places clearly, only fragments. A hallway. A backyard. The way a room felt at night.

When I mentioned the house in Pocatello, he went quiet in a way that immediately told me I’d said something wrong. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took a drag from his cigarette.

“I didn’t think you remembered that place.” he said.

I told him I did. Not all of it, but enough. I remembered the stairs. I didn’t mean anything by that, it was just the first image that came to mind but his reaction was immediate. He leaned back in his chair and looked out into the yard instead of at me. For a long moment, he didn’t say anything.

“You were very young,” he said finally. “Four. Maybe Five.”

I told him I knew. That didn’t seem to reassure him. He asked what else I remembered, and I found myself hesitating, suddenly unsure how much I was supposed to say. There are things you grow up learning not to bring up, even if no one ever tells you directly. That house was one of them.

“I remember how white it was,” I said. “And the stairs. The red ones. I always thought that was weird.”

I laughed, trying to cut the tension.

That was when he told me it bothered him that I still remembered it at all. He said memory from that early usually doesn’t last unless something anchors it. He didn’t explain what he meant by that. Instead, he said there was something he’d never told me about the day we left. Something he’d kept from me for twenty years, something he’d thought I was too young to carry with me.

He asked if I really wanted to hear it.

That was the first time it occurred to me that whatever had happened in that house hadn’t ended when we left.

We moved into the house in Pocatello when I was still young enough to be excited by the idea of having a real front door. Before that, we’d lived in apartments and manufactured homes. Places that all felt temporary. This house didn’t. It was old and solid, with wide steps and thick walls that smelled faintly of wood and dust. I remember thinking it felt like a place people stayed.

What I remember most clearly is the way it looked when we first arrived. The exterior was painted a bright, almost blinding white, layered thick over old wooden paneling. The stairs leading up to the front door were painted red. Too red, even to a child’s eye. They stood out sharply against the white of the house and the fresh-cut grass, rising to a large black door that always seemed to soak in the daylight.

Something about those stairs made me uneasy, though I didn’t have language for that feeling at the time. I remember pausing on them more than once, looking down at my feet before climbing the rest of the way up. But I was excited too. I had my own room for the first time, and the town itself felt friendly and familiar in a way other places hadn’t. Inside, the house was quiet in a way I wasn’t used to. Sound didn’t travel the same way it had in our previous places. Footsteps seemed softer, voices more distant. The floors were dark, worn wood, and light came through the windows in narrow bands that shifted slowly across the walls as the day went on.

My room was down a hallway that always felt longer at night. It wasn’t large, but it was mine. I spent most of my time there on the floor, surrounded by toys, drawing or building things I never finished. From my window I could see the yard and the garden my father and his wife worked on in the evenings. During the day, it felt safe.

At night, the house felt different. I don’t remember anything specific happening at first. No noises I could point to, no shapes in the dark, but I remember being aware of the space around me in a way I hadn’t been before. Doors seemed farther away. Corners felt deeper. I always asked my father to keep my door open, even though I couldn’t have explained why.

Downstairs, the basement was finished but rarely used. It stayed cool year-round and smelled faintly of concrete and old air. I didn’t spend much time down there, but I remember the light switch at the top of the stairs, and the way the light looked when it was on. Dull and yellow, seeping up through the gaps in the dark floorboards above.

At the time, it didn’t mean anything to me. It was just the way the house was.

The first things that happened weren’t frightening. They were irritating.

My father worked long hours then as he does now. When he came home, he was usually tired, already halfway thinking about the next day. Most nights he stayed up later than the rest of us, sitting at the kitchen table or in the living room with paperwork spread out in front of him, a cup of coffee going cold beside his elbow and a cigarette always between his fingers. The house would be quiet by the time he finally decided to go to bed.

That was when he started noticing the light.

The basement was finished, but it wasn’t a place we used often. It was too cool, too dim, and it never quite felt like part of the rest of the house. The light switch was at the top of the stairs, just inside the doorway. When the light was on, it bled up through the gaps in the dark floorboards above, faint yellow lines stretching across the wood like something trying to surface.

The first time he saw it, he assumed he’d forgotten to turn it off.

He went downstairs, flipped the switch, and stood there for a moment, listening. The basement was quiet. No hum from the light. No sound of anyone moving. Satisfied, he came back upstairs and went to bed.

The next night, it was on again.

He noticed it while locking up the house, the faint glow visible through the floor near the kitchen. He frowned, cursed under his breath, and went back down the stairs. Off again. Another moment of standing still, another quick glance around, then back upstairs.

By the third or fourth time, it had started to irritate him.

He asked his wife if she’d been down there late at night, if she’d left the light on by accident. She said no. He asked me once, casually, if I’d been playing in the basement. I hadn’t. I only ever went down there with one of them.

It kept happening anyway.

Some nights it would be off. Other nights it would be on again, always late, always after the house had gone quiet. He began checking it automatically before bed, annoyed as he headed for the stairs. Sometimes he’d turn it off and find it on once he reached the main floor. It turned into a small, pointless battle with the house. One that never escalated enough to demand real attention, but never stopped either.

I didn’t know about any of this at the time. Or if I did, it didn’t register. Looking back, I realize it was the first thing that made my father uneasy. Not afraid. Not yet. Just aware.

He didn’t talk about it much. He didn’t pray over it or call anyone about it. He did what he always did when something didn’t make sense. He ignored it and kept working. The light wasn’t hurting anyone. It wasn’t costing him anything but a few extra steps down the stairs.

But it was persistent.

By the time anything truly frightening happened, the house already felt different. Quieter somehow. The wooden floors felt darker and heavier. As if it had learned our routines and was testing how much we would overlook.

It happened one ordinary afternoon. The sun was high, pouring through my bedroom window. I remember the breeze flowing through the curtains. I was playing with a friend from school. We had spread our craft-store animal toys across the floor. The large rug our ocean for little sharks and whales. Arranging them in patterns and making up grand stories. The air was warm and still, the kind of quiet that makes a house feel like home.

My father’s wife came in to tell us that my friend’s mother was outside, waiting to take him home. We said our goodbyes and I heard them leave, their voices drifting across the yard. I began to gather the toys, putting them into the box I always kept in my closet. I paused to look out the window. My father and stepmother were talking in the garden. They seemed calm, unhurried. I placed the box in the closet and began to rummage through another for more toys.

Then it happened.

I felt it before I even understood it. Two large hands pressed hard against my upper back. The shove sent me stumbling into the closet, the doors slamming shut behind me.

Darkness. Complete. I couldn’t see a thing. I couldn’t even think about what had pushed me. All I felt was a sudden, overwhelming dread and a strange, insistent compulsion not to turn around. I screamed, of course. I cried. I banged against the closet walls, hoping someone would hear me. I remember the air smelled faintly of wood polish and dust. Every sound in the house seemed amplified. It was one of the first times I could hear my heart pounding in my ears.

My father came running. He must have heard my screams from outside. I could hear him pounding on the closet doors, calling my name. He tried to pull the doors open. They didn’t budge at first. Then, he began smashing his heel into them. The doors splintered and he ripped me out.

Nothing else happened. Just as suddenly as it began, it ended. The closet was empty. I was shaking. My father held me tight. I remember the quiet afterward. The kind that fills a room when everyone has stopped breathing at the same time.

After that, my feelings one the house completely changed.

Pressure began to fill the house. It wasn’t that anything visible had changed. The walls were the same white, the sun still fell through the windows in the same narrow bands. But the air was heavier, colder somehow, and the shadows seemed longer. Hallways felt more confining. My room, once a place of comfort, felt hollow, and the window looking out over the yard no longer reassured me.

None of us wanted to be alone there anymore. I stopped going into the hallways without company. My father spent more time in the workshop or outside, avoiding the house when he could. He wouldn't talk about what had happened. I could tell he didn’t want to acknowledge it. That was his way of keeping it from becoming real.

My stepmother took a different approach. She spent hours in the kitchen with books open, reading about ways to cleanse and protect a home. She tried sage, incense, and prayers. Sometimes she moved through the rooms muttering softly, fumbling with bundles of dried herbs. My father allowed it, though reluctantly, and mostly stayed away while she worked. After that, the house seemed to settle somewhat. It wasn’t the same as before, but the oppressive weight lifted just enough that daily life could continue.

Still, I noticed changes in small ways. Doors that used to swing easily now creaked even when touched lightly. Floors groaned under no weight. Shadows in corners shifted as if avoiding the light. At night, the basement smelled stronger, sharper, colder. The house seemed aware of our movements, and of our reluctance to be alone.

I tried to ignore it, focusing on toys, games, friends, and school. But there was a tension always in the background, a quiet waiting. And I realized, even as a child, that it wasn’t going away entirely.

Months later, I left to visit my mother. When I returned, the feelings I once had, the excitement, pride, and comfort were gone. The scarlet stairs, once vivid and playful in my memory, now seemed like a sprawling tongue of some great monster. Something I had to climb carefully, as if each step required a conscious effort. The hall by my room was darker, longer, and I could feel the house itself pressing around me.

By then, I understood one thing. Whatever had happened in that closet had changed the house, and in some ways, it had changed us too.

It was late, quiet. The kind of night where all outside sounds diminish into eerie stillness. I had been sleeping in my room, the door open as usual, when my father woke to get a glass of water. On his way back, he said, he felt the need to check on me.

When he opened the door, he froze.

According to him I was standing on my bed. My eyes had rolled back, showing only the whites. My arms were extended in a stiff, strange formation. Something like an arrow, my father would later say. I was moving my lips, forming words, but nothing came out that anyone could understand.

He grabbed me immediately. I remember being too frightened to even register the comfort of his hands. He held me tight, commanding, praying to Christ, speaking aloud in a way that made him sound both furious and terrified. His voice boomed through the house and woke my stepmother.

I don’t remember the words he said. I only remember the sensation. The pressure of his hands, the sound of his voice filling the room. Then, it was over. Just like the closet. I was normal again. The bed, the blankets, the room. Everything was as it had been.

After that night, nothing else happened at that level of intensity. We moved soon after, living with my grandparents for a while until things settled elsewhere.

Even years later, he said he thought I was making the sign of the cross with my body but it had looked more like an arrow, deliberate and odd. For him, it was terrifying. For me, it was confusing. And for both of us, it left a mark on the memory of that house that never faded.

Years later, as we sat together on that porch, in the late summer evening. The Florida heat softening as it faded into evening. We talked about many things, as we always did life, work, small worries but inevitably, the house in Pocatello came up again.

He told me he was surprised I remembered it at all. “I didn’t think any of that would stick,” he said. “You were so young.”

I told him I remembered the scarlet stairs, the hallways, the basement light. He nodded, listening, but his eyes seemed distant, like he was weighing whether he should say more.

Then he paused. Long enough for me to realize that something important was coming.

He told me that the day we finally moved, he and my aunt were outside, packing the last boxes into the moving truck. As they worked, he said, both of them looked up. The sky was dark with clouds and the stairs looked like an open wound. Both of them saw it.

A black silhouette. Watching from my bedroom window.

He hadn’t told me because he decided I was too young to know such things. Too innocent to carry it. He had assumed I would forget it with the years.

I didn’t respond at first. The image, twenty years later, pressed itself into my mind with the same sudden sharpness it must have had in my father’s eyes that day. I could see it, standing there against the dark glass of the window, impossibly still. Unseen eyes boring holes into me

We didn’t speak about it again. Never to be brought up. The story dying with the last ember of his cigarette. But the memory lingered, as all the others did. The stairs, the closet, the basement light. A quiet reminder that some things, no matter how long ago, don’t end when you leave them behind.

Tasting Notes: Blueberry - Raspberry - Lavender - Mirabelle Plum

Finca El Destino is an exceptional farm located in the Boquete region of Panama, in the heart of the lush Chiriquí mountains.

Founded by Benito Bermúdez and Mario Castrellón, two iconic figures in the Panamanian gastronomy and coffee scene, the farm's mission is to produce exceptional coffees through a modern, sustainable, and innovative approach.

For this batch, the cherries are processed using Cool Water Fermentation, a unique technique where they ferment anaerobically under the cold water of a mountain spring located on the farm. This low-temperature fermentation develops an aromatic profile guided by the Horqueta terroir: floral, delicate, and juicy with fruity notes.

In the cup, it reveals notes of blueberry, raspberry, lavender, and mirabelle plum. A delicate and remarkably balanced profile.

Today, Finca El Destino is one of the new Panamanian farms that are shaking up the specialty coffee scene. Its sought-after and award-winning lots perfectly reflect the ambition of its founders: to produce rare, refined coffees deeply marked by their terroir.",1,1766466038.0,TanatAdventCalendar25,0,1.0,False

I didn’t really drive much but have been driving a ton this year because I love it. I’ll go to a coffee shop an hour away for the fun of it. I love driving so much I started driving for DoorDash and uber eats. 

    I have had conflicts with my mom in the past about driving. She pays all my bills even though I desperately want a job/ to move out and I have been close several times with opportunities scoped out and lined up but my mom shoots them down. 
  
    In October I had to fight to drive myself somewhere an hour away. She didn’t want to let me because I had never driven that far before. I had but she didn’t know about it. She tryed to say I should wait untill dad could go with me. It took so much courage to ask if I could go by myself. 

A few weeks ago she was upset I went to the store with it having snowed the previous night and there were still flurrys. The roads were pretty much perfect. I have a Subaru and she had me take a defensive driving course. She said it was irresponsible to go out because I didn’t know what the roads were like. I had a dentist appointment that day and asked to drive myself (about an hour away) and it took a lot of conveniencing but she said yes. 

Previously in a diffrent situation she was fine with the idea of me driving 4-5 hours by myself. We are going home for the holidays. The drive is about 6-7 hours highway and 9 hours non highway. I joked that if I wasn’t ready to leave in time I would have to drive separately. This sparked a huge reaction/ drama that lasted several hours. 

She said 6-7 hours on the highway was too hard and the back way was two long. I said I could stop overnight halfway but she said that my dad and brother agreed those are roads I don’t need to be on alone. I have driven non highway country roads a ton. From google maps, only one part looked slightly hairy and I could avoid that. I plotted stops every few hours also if I needed to. I would also print a paper map and save the directions off line. My bank account comes with 24/7 roadside assistance. 

After initially considering it, she decided (as of last time I checked) I am not driving home and I either go with her or don’t go. She said do I dislike her so much I can’t ride with her. She said there’s no reason for me to drive myself and there will be holiday traffic. She said I what I’m doing and how I’m acting is very hurtful and I’m ruining Christmas. She said she’s very upset and disappointed and my dad and brother will be also. She said I have a car at home so why do I need to drive myself? She bought me the car at home so I could have something to take to the town 5 hours away where I will spend winter spring. We got it bc I urgently wanted to go a few weeks ago but didn’t have a car. We got it and we couldent get the tags/ insurance set up to drive out of state for a few weeks. She called me spoiled and ungrateful. She asked why I wanted to drive myself so bad. I said I’m almost 30 I don’t know why I can’t drive places and I want to start living like a real adult and be able to make my own choices. I also said I might like my car more than the new car and could decide which one to take. She said that’s not my decision to make. She and my brother were blowing up my phone with calls but I was too upset/ afraid to answer. She said real adults don’t handle situations like this. She said she would not go home for the holidays so she wouldent have to worry about me driving.

“If you truly want to be independent, then you need to decide where you are living and
support yourself. Being independent has nothing to do with making a long drive in holiday traffic for absolutely no reason.” 

“It has to do with you have only recently driven as far as a couple hours and even more that we
bought a car for home so the Subaru could stay here”


Some things I said: 

“ im almost 30 l don't know why I can't drive a route I planned. I have looked at the cities/ stops just like I did for (city 5 hours away”

In response she said: 

“The route to XXXXX is wayyy less out in middle of nowhere”


I also said 
“I am im sorry i just wanted to be able to do normal things like a 30 year old not an 18 year old but i dont deserve anything i have”



At one point she even thought I was lying and had secrete plans. She kept saying how I was selfish, spoiled, ungrateful, hurtful, and how I was ruining Christmas

Maybe he's hallucinating? A sinister plot of some kind? I think a saving grace is he has his dog. They have superior senses. And he likes the dogs company and the no talking. 

Folks have so much trouble communicating. Maybe we communicate too much? It'd be interesting experiment to have a day where you have companionable silence but no talking. 

I mean, your partner isn't privy to everything you think. And vice versa. Certain memories might be sacred, cherished. 

I don't do the popular trend of letting your partner have access to your phone. My phone is locked. My sites are mine. And I don't go on my pals phone. That's his business.

My spouse (33M) was diagnosed with late stage 3 colon cancer earlier this year, against the odds he’s cancer free now. To celebrate, I’m surprising him with a trip to SF in late February. I’ve been twice for work and he’s never been. I know the general sights and such, but some things I could use recommendations: 

- Jazz bar or live music venue
- restaurant for a nice dinner
- coffee shops

Lastly any good recommendations for some adult fun, could just be some midnight ballerina watching or more. We’ve had to put most spicy extracurriculars on hold due to treatment and precautions around being immunocompromised. I was thinking nothing says “I’m alive” more than an experience. 

Our budget is not huge, grateful he’s alive, medical bills are still a bitch. But will be able to splurge a few hundred.

1ptl41x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1ptl41x/meat_god_egghead_chapter_v/,MEAT GOD - EGGHEAD: Chapter V,"The Barton Forensic Lab was almost empty. No lights in the main corridor, except for the bright screen on the coffee vending machine. So nobody noticed the dark silhouette dragging something heavy over the grey carpet. The back door leading to the alley opened, and the silhouette dressing a white robe and bloody gloves, got outside, travelling by foot, moving with strange pace, without any hurry even under the downpour.

Chung’s body went across the parking lot, walking pass his blue Honda Civic, busy in his hellish task, dragging a large and heavy body bag.

The thing inside Chung’s body made him walk for almost four miles, along the road verge. The grass under his shoes was wet and slippery. The accumulation of mud made his feet stumble, but the almost robotic pace of Chung’s body was fast and steady, as an insect. It made him step to the left, to pass the trees line. It was dark inside the woods, but it knew very well where it was and where to go. You don’t need eyes to see, nor nose to smell.

After two hours, it got to the clear. The thunders shone in the dark, reflecting over the crystal surface of the lake. The thing inside Chung opened the gray body bag, took out an old female body from it, and dragged him and her inside the black waters of the Lough Ree lake, and they all vanished for a long while.

There weren’t colors in the darkness and the cold, just things. Those things, little quiet critters, swam to the very bottom of the lake, where something huge, a metal rock with a hole the size a house, was resting. The thing got right inside the rock, no need to check, no need to look and find nothing. It was there, the whole treasure. Shinning like orange stars, gold spheres from a world that not belong to this time or even to anything you could ever imagine. They were infinite (even if it wasn’t true, for the thing knew the exact number of spheres), but the limbs and storage capacity of this body had its limits, so it only chose a couple, and stuffed the other body’s mouth, pushing with the host arm all the way down, breaking tissues, destroying structures that didn’t matter anymore.

After some time –hours maybe; many minutes; the right time it took one star to explode in the immensity of interstellar hole- it was back! The body it was dragging wasn’t in the bag, and it left a nice track of bloody mud, leaves and water. It was a total mess, but it would fulfill its immediate purpose. To incubate.

The belly of the body inflated and vibrated, and the whole body stood up. It took it some effort to walk, but it got toward one of the body compartments and opened it. Something white and shinny came out from its mouth, and it has to break the owner jaws to leave space, but the long white snake left its tip to show, and it shrieked with a low-pitched voice.

 

\*\*\*

   
That Tuesday morning, doctor Daniel Jonestone drove the 96 toward Lessing Park. The sky was gray and it was raining, but when he went out of the car, the heavy air made him sweat. He got inside the Barton Forensic Laboratory lobby, and had a little chat with Rebecca, the young receptionist.

“Morning!” the doctor greeted her over the counter.

“Oh, hi Daniel”, Rebecca answered.

There were lots of papers in her hands.

“How many cases today?”

“For now? Two” she said. “A man who was shot in Perry, and an old lady, maybe a crash accident.”

*Old lady; maybe a crash.* Maybe, of course maybe. Gosh, why in Heaven they let old timers behind the steering wheel?

“Ouch!”, Jonestone said. “Shot in Perry, terrible!”

The good doctor smiled at the receptionist, but she was too busy to fall under his charm.

“Did you see Jim today?”

Rebecca shook her head.

“Then the old owl may still be here. What a workaholic!” Jonestone exclaimed, smiling.

James Chung, such a strange fellow. No wife, no lovers; lonely as a rock. A man capable of open people up twenty-four hours straight, only with the help of nicotine and a few coffee cups. Well, it was true that some people don’t need human interaction at all, but there was something weird going on about him, all the same. Or maybe, he was that kind of people who feel a bizarre passion for what he does. They all chose the forensic field after all, and nobody was more mentally stable than nobody.

But Jonestone would try to fix that someday. He would put the old asocial doctor Chung under a high dose of alcohol and marijuana, and take him right into the nearest cabaret. “Hurry, driver, it’s a goddamned emergency, you know?”

Jonestone put on the white robe and the mod-cap, and waited for the police witness to arrive. For some reason, he chose the old lady first. Of course, he wanted to have his fun with the poor victim, but he didn’t know for sure whatever she was inside a car or walking the street when it happened, and if she was inside the car, whatever she was responsible for the crash, or if she was the victim of somebody else’ stupidity.

The detective arrived half an hour late. He was wearing civil clothing, a white shirt, a bone-white pair of pants, leather shoes-. He greeted Jonestone with a handshake.

Both Jonestone and the detective went to the cold deposit to bring the cadaver. She was tagged as “Jane Doe, case #AB-232”. Jonestone knocked the door of the examination room, and waited. Nobody answered. He knocked again, and then he opened the door himself.

The detective covered his nose.

“Oh, good morning, Jim!”, Jonestone said.

At the end of the room, his boss, doctor Chung, was working on a body.

Jonestone got Mrs. Caitlin Bolton (her name was in the ID, inside her wallet), born October 17^(th), 1912, naked and took polaroids of the hundred blue bruises on her chest and head, and then washed the old lady’s body, felling something broken every time his gloved hand touched a limb.

“It seems Mrs. Bolton was inside her car when she died”, he said to the detective. “She crashed with something, or another car, and the force made her go forward. She wasn’t wearing her seat belt, and it seems the airbag got inflated a little too late. There is a big bruise on her forehead.”

Yes, there was a nasty looking blue circle on her tan skin. Blood coming out from her nostrils and ears.

“Too soon to say, but maybe the cause of death is brain trauma or a broken neck.”

Jonestone took the scalpel and arrange the lady’s hair in one pony tail, in order to clear a white line of skin. He cut a perfect line around the body’s head, blood dripping like black paint into the metal table, and slowly pulled the skin layer away from the skull, over her face, covering the eyes and the nose area. Then, he took the autopsy electrical saw. The blade on the tip, looking like a sharp incomplete circle, spun alive.

“All right” doctor Jonestone said, “let’s find out what kill you, darling.”

As the metal saw made a humming sound as its cut through the skull shell. White dust of bone covered the iron surface next to the lady’s shoulders. The detective said something and stepped back. Jonestone couldn’t hear him; his attention fully fixed in the task at hand, but he tried his best to hear him.

“What?”, Jonestone asked, stopping the saw, looking at the man in a white shirt, maybe four or five feet away from him, with a strange grimace on his face, one the good doctor was no able to indentify. No, but he could see the gun aiming at him, and the detective’s wide open eyes, and the teeth showing, like when somebody feels a lot of pain, and he thought the officer may be either scared or angry.

Jonestone wasn’t scared, but he didn’t like the thing a bit.

“Detective? What’s the matter?”

“THE HELL IS THIS?!” the man said, but the gun wasn’t aiming at the doctor. It was aiming at something behind him.

It felt like a dream. Someone would even say it was more like a hellish nightmare, made by the Devil itself, and somebody else would even say it was like in a crappy horror movie, with tons of cheap especial effects and bad actors. But from Jonestone’s perspective, everything had almost perfect sense: Doctor James Chung got fucking nuts.

That was all, actually.

Chung’s gloved hands were fully covered in different kind of flesh tissues, some pinkish, other yellowish and some dark red. He was squeezing those clusters of meat like a maniac, and the worst part was that everything came from inside a cadaver, maybe a black man. Chung eyes were feverish with excitement, and blank at the same time, while the dark painted thing that was his mouth, was chewing on something only Good Lord Almighty would know what, for all kind of fluids leaked from his lips.

“My god…” said Jonestone.

“The fuck he’s doing?” asked the detective.

“Okay, okay, calm down, please” said Jonestone, stepping himself between the fire line and his partner. “There must be a very logical explanation behind this… Hummm, doctor Chung has been under a lot of pressure, that’s all, officer. Shall we all calm down just a little, and talk it out? Huh?”

“What’s your explanation for this?!”

“Oh, don’t know” said Jonestone, looking down, opening and closing his fists. “James, are you okay? Can you stop doing -- that? We are in a, hum, crisis…”

But Chung didn’t stop. He leaned over the dead man’s face, as if he were about to kiss him, and chopped off his fat lips in one quick bite, revealing the white teeth underneath, and the intense yellow layers of fat under the dark skin. He then turned his head toward Jonestone, like an owl, and kept chewing the yellow meat, slowly, with his mouth open. In that moment, watching his mentor doing such a disgusting act, Jonestone thighs trembled and he felt an intense cold coming up on the back of his head. Chung began walking toward him, menacing.

Jonestone was perplexed, and that’s probably why he didn’t feel the detective’s hand pulling his shoulder back, but he heard him shouting.

“Let’s go, doctor. Let’s get the fuck out of here!”

Jonestone looked at him, wanting to say something, but his mouth, willingly moving, pronouncing each word as it was, didn’t let out any sound. He couldn’t talk at all, but the detective caught him, caught what his words were.

“He is not your partner anymore”, the detective said, “he is infected with something. Let’s get out, doctor!”

Jonestone looked at Chung in the eyes. The brown iris was covered with a milky substance, making him look blind, but for sure he wasn’t. His whole body was turned now, showing the bloody apron. From the dim holes of his nostrils, a couple of white and shinny fibers were moving independently, like a hundred roots of fungus or little thin hairs. Dr. Chung, or the creature that he was transformed to, took the dead arm from the body behind him, and opened his mouth so wide, that at some point the joints of his jaws pooped, and the side of his lips tensed, showing the line of his teeth. He put the whole hand of the cadaver inside the gape hole of a bloody mouth, flexing the shoulder in an unnatural position, and bit the dead wrist with such violence, that in a second, the white bone was showing, between reddish lines of muscle, and there was no hand anymore, just an empty wrist, surrounded by severed tendons.

The sound of his teeth trying to crush the phalanges and the rest of little but tough bones, was a real nightmare.

Jonestone thought that, at that moment, he has seen enough. He went behind the detective, still perplexed, and a bit fascinated too for the monstrosity he was witnessing.

“We better get out of here, and close that door”, said doctor Jonestone.

The detective only nodded, but half way to the exit, they made another ghastly discovery: Five naked people were standing around them. They were, judging by their state, former cadavers inside the numbered compartments. Some of them showed trauma marks on their faces or chests. There was a really fat lady, whose face was swollen and blue, and her eyes were marble spheres of dead. Probably, they have been there all the time, but neither the detective nor Jonestone noticed them. They weren’t much of a problem, for the way toward the exit was free, but those grotesque bodies began to walk, slowly at first, narrowing the semicircle around the real living, and their risen hands, fingers in eagle claws position, weren’t a good sing.

If anything, they meant their end.

The detective shot three times, two at Chung’s head (which exploded in a red dust) and one at the middle of the fat lady’s chest, near her heart. But they were still there, moving, getting closer step by step, in silence. Jonestone was terrified, for he couldn’t believe this out-of-this-world nightmare, but it was happening for real never the less. He felt that for sure, when a painfully pressure cut a nice chunk of meat from his right trapezoid muscle.

He turned, his left hand pressing the injury which bled and felt cold, and looked at his attacker. A skinny man, maybe some Johnny Doe in some abandon street, was chewing the doctor’s fresh flesh. Jonestone heard a few more shots, a scream, and it was late by then, for he collapsed to the white tiled floor, and all around him turned dark…

1ptl3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1ptl3ek/the_club_she_never_left/,The Club She Never Left,"Susan Grayson started her day with a cup of coffee and whatever her youngest child wouldn't finish for breakfast as she rushed him and her oldest out the door and into the car to ensure they wouldn't be late for school. While dropping them off, she would meet up with the rest of the PTA moms to catch up on things. It was usually gossip or what the next fundraiser goal would be, and who would be baking what.

""By the way, Susie."" Her childhood friend, Helen, spoke up, getting her attention since she had been zoning out during the whole conversation and had always left her out every time. ""Yeah?"" Susan cleared her throat and looked up from her thermos of now-cold coffee.

""Well, my next-door neighbor, the one with the Tesla. She offered for us to join their book club. They found this book that has never been released to the public before."" Helen twirled a blond curl around her index finger as she spoke, looking at each one of them, trying to see if anyone was interested, but they declined. Susan frowned, seeing the disappointment on her friend's face, and placed a hand on her shoulder. ""I'll join it with. I have some free time when Tom comes home from work so that he can watch the kids for at least a little while.""

Helen's bright eyes light up. ""Thank you, Susie. I knew I could count on you."" She nodded and proceeded to leave the school and head home for the day. Susan went about her day doing her daily chores and planning out what to make for dinner that week, since she usually packed leftovers for lunches. When Tom came home with the kids, she walked up to him, gave him a big hug, and asked how his day went.

He gave her a tired nod and his usual work response. Susan smiled and held his hand for a short while before he went to shower and sit down to dinner with his family. During that time, she would bring up the book club.

""Helen asked if I would join a book club with her."" Susan casually brought up, poking her fork into the green beans on her plate. Tom tilted his head to the side, chewing a bit of meatloaf before responding, ""The blond? I honestly didn't think she had ever picked up a book before.""

The children snickered, and his wife pouted, ""Thomas."" She scolded, and he shrugged, taking another bite before sipping his drink. He had always disliked Helen since they met in high school when she introduced Tom as her boyfriend. Tom told Susan that Helen was clingy and always got her into some trouble.

""If you want to go, I don't mind watching the kids for a while.""

""Thank you."" Tom nodded and finished his meal, gathering up the empty plates to wash them in the kitchen. The following day, Susan met up with Helen to walk over to her next-door neighbor's house. A woman with dark, slicked-back hair tied into a high ponytail answered the door. ""Helen, it's so good to see you."" She greeted her with a smile, and it faded when she looked at Susan. ""Oh, you brought a friend with you.""

""Is that okay? I'm sorry, I should have asked."" Helen pouted, and the woman brushed it off. ""It's perfectly fine. The more, the merrier."" The woman muttered and looked at Susan with a forced smile. ""Welcome to the book club."" Susan shuddered at the look this woman was giving her and knew that she definitely did not want her here. Helen gave her a reassuring look and led the way inside, where they joined a few other women in the living room.

""Everyone, this is Helen, and–""

""Susan Grayson.""

The woman sighed and rolled her eyes. ""Mrs. Grayson.""

Some greeted her, while others ignored her and turned their attention to Helen. Susan was used to being ignored, but this felt off. Yes, she was used to Helen getting all the attention wherever they went, but they seemed obsessed with her for some reason. Could this book club be a cover for a cult?

""Now, let's begin reading from the book,"" the leader of the book club began, taking out a leather-bound tome. The front was scarred and cracked, a lock on its surface long broken and forgotten. When she opened it, the tome's pages were yellow and brittle, filling the room with scents of dust and decay.

She sat upright with a smile on her face, reading aloud in an unknown language. It didn't appear to be Latin or anything she had ever heard before. A few of the other women clapped their hands and said something which was like an amen. Helen tilted her head and clapped along with them before speaking up.

""What's the translation?""

The woman looked up from the book in her hands to the blond and smiled. ""We don't need a translation to know what the words mean, Helen. If you close your eyes and open your heart, you can feel them. You can hear his voice speaking directly to your mind."" She smiled, and her eyes locked on Helen's.

""Who is he? You said that you can hear his voice."" Susan spoke up, causing the others to look at her. The woman closed the book, and a look of disgust spread across her face. ""You have just joined us, and yet you dare ask what his name is? First, you must prove yourself before we will ever allow you to utter his name.""

Prove myself? We just joined today... Susan thought to herself, raising an eyebrow inquisitively. The woman held her head high and looked away from her eyes, settling on the group. ""You're dismissed for today. Please return next weekend for another reading.""

As Helen and Susan left together and out of earshot, she spoke up, ""There is something wrong with that book club.""

""Oh, you're just imagining things."" Helen brushed her off with a sigh.

""Helen, I'm telling you those people are a cult.""

The blonde stood in her tracks, looking at her childhood friend, ""Susan."" Her voice was stern, and her arms crossed in front of her. ""If you keep saying such things, weird rumors will start to spread, and innocent people will get hurt. So why don't you keep it to yourself?""

""But Helen...I""

""Enough, Susan!""

The blonde turned on her heel. ""I'll see you next weekend.""

Without another word, she went inside her house, leaving Susan completely alone. She needed to stop this, but how could she? Helen didn't believe her. She thought that it was just some gimmick to get people to join the book club. How could she prove that they are bad people? Susan could leave Helen alone with those people and quit, but her conscience wouldn't allow her to do so. She would have to continue to attend and find proof of what is going on between the lines that Helen is too oblivious to see. When the weekend rolled around, Susan was running a bit behind and arrived late at the club meeting. She reached out a hand to knock on the door, only to find it slightly ajar.

Curious, Susan pushed the door open with her foot and stepped inside. The entrance was dimly lit and void of any life. Gently shutting the door behind her, she continued further inside, squinting her eyes to see better in the darkness.

*Thump...scrape...thump*

Was that sound from the basement? Next to the stairs was an open door with a red light spilling out across the floor and walls. Taking a deep breath, Susan exhaled slowly, taking her time walking down the stairs, where she found herself in an open room with a sacrificial altar in the middle. On top of it was Helen, dressed in white robes with her eyes closed. She slowly made her way over, gently shaking her childhood friend.

""Helen!"" Susan spoke in an intense whisper, glancing around them.

""You're late, Mrs. Grayson."" Susan turned, seeing the woman with the slicked-back dark hair in a high bun. She turned to face, her brows knitting in a furrowed expression. Susan clenched her hands into fists down at her sides. What had they done to Helen?

""What did you do to her?!""

""My Mrs. Grayson, I didn't know you were capable of such anger. I thought we were doing you a favor.""

""Doing me a favor? Helen is my best friend; why would I want anything to happen to her?""

The woman asked and walked up to the altar. ""Either way, you're too late. She won't wake up until the ritual is over. Why don't you finish it for us?"" She turned to Susan, handing over a yellow page. ""All you have to do is read the words on the page.""

She held the page in her hand, looking at the ancient dialect before her. Finish it? No, Susan wasn't going to do that, was she? Before she knew it, her lips moved on their own, speaking aloud the words that were foreign to her. Helen began to cough, her eyes opening their usual light color, turning pitch black, completely engulfing even the sclera.

The coughing became worse, and then the gargling started as Helen spat up blood. The sound of bone and flesh being torn and cracked filled the air, and when Susan looked down, she gasped, almost bumping into one of the members who held her by the shoulders.

""Watch with us, Susan, and gaze upon his arrival!"" The woman raised her arms in the air. They chanted a name, something which came out in gibberish when it was spoken.

*Volgroan*

*Volgroan*

*Volgroan*

Just in the world was Volgroan? As Susan questioned this, she watched as a creature crawled its way out of Helen's broken rib cage. It moved and writhed its blood-drenched body out of the fractured body under it. She looked up at it, frozen in fear. The creature's body was a blend of corded muscle and jagged bloodstone. Its eyes burned like molten embers, flickering like fire.

Hooked horns curve downwards from its skull; its clawed hands drip with blood. When it roared, the sound was a symphony of death itself echoing off the walls. Whatever, this thing filled Susan with dread, and now she had released it onto the world. ",1,1766465379.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

39/M/US here. 

I’ve posted on this subreddit, and others like it, for several weeks to little fanfare. This doesn’t mean I haven’t had some great people reach out, it simply means I haven’t found the type of person I seek. 

I find the art of wordplay very romantic; finding new ways to convey thoughts, feelings, emotions, and make yourself stand out are all very important to me. I feel like I’ve shorted myself for nearly 40 years - not showing many people who I am and what I’m about. I genuinely want to change this. 

I’ve always been the “fun guy”. The best friend. The second lead male in all your favorite romance books. The guy who brings the comedic relief but also drops the nugget of wisdom that makes the MMC confess his true feelings to the coffee shop owner (our FMC). 
I’m more than that, though. I am far from the smartest or the most interesting man in the room but I feel I offer quite a bit. 
I can entertain you with tales of my days as a newspaper columnist, as a former stand-up comedian, or as the guy at work who impressed everyone with his ability to kick his leg far above his head. 

I’ve been accused of being AI…of using AI…of being a “bot”, but nothing could be further from the truth. 

Case in point? I’m awake contemplating the holidays. I lost my mom during this time of year 10 + years ago and though I have found that time does make things easier, I always miss her the most during the holidays. It’s far too easy to feel sorry for myself and really let all the ugly cries out when it’s late and quiet and I have nothing but memories to carry me to the daylight. 

Who am I? I’m a reader. A writer. A lover of laughs. A man who can probably eat an entire cake in one sitting (as long as it’s buttercream frosting and not that hippy dippy whipped crap). I’m a brother and a son to parents who are both no longer on this earth. I’m an uncle, a boss, a stranger, the guy you make eye contact with in line at the movie theater and look at your date and say, “that guys looks like he would know good movies”.

I’m looking for a friend. Someone to share wins and cry over losses with. Someone who can speak the language of humor, music, and stupid movie quotes. 

I’m complex. Emotionally intelligent. Self-aware. I have a billion ideas and not one single ounce of gumption to make any of those ideas a reality. I skate by with charm and charisma and lots of favors requested. 

Flawed. Nerdy. Heckin’ chonker. That’s me. I’ll turn you on to great life hacks, new hobbies, and kick-ass music. I’ll also listen to all your problems and carry your sadness as my own. I’ll make you laugh and think. I’ll make you wish you had some snacks. 

Come join me on something that I have a hard time describing - a friendship. A connection. A relationship. I can only sell myself so many ways (go check out the plethora of posts in my profile… I’ve tried it all). 

In the words of American poet Jim Morrison - come on baby, light my fire. ",1,1766465298.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1ptl0yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ptl0yy/i_still_hate_that_blue_shirt/,I Still Hate that Blue Shirt,"“Bye, babe,” my husband kissed me on the lips, still holding my waist, as I inhaled his cologne through his blue shirt.



“Can you please pick up your daughter in the evening? I’d like to push out at least ten pages today,” I murmured against his lips, planting another kiss.



“My daughter?” he quipped playfully and left me to my empty document, silent house, and a stack of first-draft corrections.



With a huge mug of coffee settled beside the stack, I didn’t see the hours pass by. The house stayed unnervingly still, as if holding its breath.



The sunlight hit my eyes, sharp and sudden, and I discovered three things: I had slept at my laptop, I hadn’t eaten anything, and I hadn’t spoken to another human since morning.



Late afternoon. My daughter wasn’t home yet.



Panic gripped my heart, quick and cold, as I scrambled for my phone.



A hand landed on my shoulder.



I screamed and nearly fell off my chair. My husband stood there, smiling, clad in the same perfect blue shirt he’d left home in. 



Not a crease out of place.



I opened my mouth to speak, and he cut me off. “She’s fine. She’s in her room,” he assured me. His voice was calm. Too calm.

I nodded slightly. An unsettling feeling washed over me, slow and heavy. His smile was not right. His smile lines were stretched too thin, pulled farther than they should go. 



I shook it off and walked to the bathroom on the upper floor, telling myself I was tired.



Something felt off. I gripped my phone too tightly, leaving red marks in my palm. The screen felt slick with sweat.



I went back down after some time. My husband wasn’t in my writing office.



The house was quiet. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that presses against your ears.



My daughter usually attached herself to my side within 0.3 seconds of getting home from school. Was she even in her room?



I climbed two steps at a time and threw her door open.



The room was empty.



Her bag wasn’t thrown on the floor. Her skirt wasn’t hanging on the corner chair. 



The bed was untouched. The room looked exactly like how I’d left it that morning.



I swore to whatever gods were near me that I had seen my husband and heard his claim of bringing our daughter home.



Phone?



Where did I leave my phone?



I sprinted toward the bathroom, threw a glance inside, then jumped three steps at a time back to my writing desk. My phone was missing. My pulse thudded in my ears.



I turned around and found it on top of my bookshelf.



I hadn’t been anywhere near it since morning. The top shelf was too high.



Did I dream about my husband bringing our daughter home?



I checked the time. 3:34 PM.



I called my husband. The ringer went through fully. Each ring felt longer than the last. He didn’t pick up.



Where was he?



I checked room by room, the kitchen, the living room, his office, and our bedroom.



Everything was the same as I’d left it that morning, and yet everything felt disturbed, like someone had moved through it without leaving a trace.



I whirled around at the sensation of being watched and saw my husband coming out of our bathroom.



I had just been there. I knew I had. He was definitely not there.



He smiled at me and turned toward our bedroom, unhurried. I dragged my leaden legs and forced myself to follow him, my feet refusing to move any faster.



A jarring ringtone tore through the silence.



I jumped as I saw the caller ID.



My husband.



The screen glowed in my hand. He had just passed me. My skin prickled as I answered.



Silence. Then his voice filled the air from my phone. “Babe, I’m almost reaching home. Do you want anything for me to grab from the store?”



A sweet giggle followed, light and careless. My daughter’s.



The hallway tilted.



I don’t remember much after that. I heard something clatter to the floor, and my mind went dark.



I came back to myself in the arms of my neighbor. Hands gripping me. Voices shouting somewhere far away.



The night sky twinkled above. A small, warm form was curled into my lap. My sweet baby. Breathing. Alive.



His blue shirt came into view. It was crumpled now, wrinkled, wrong in a different way.



I lifted my eyes to meet his. Worry filled his face, real worry. He crouched down, his smile tired and shaken, nothing forced about it.



This man was my husband.



Not whatever I had seen that afternoon in our home.



Words stumbled and poured out of me as his hands held mine tightly, grounding, familiar. My body gave out, viscerally, and I broke into heaving sobs. I didn’t know if he understood that something else had stood in his place inside our home. I couldn’t make myself say it aloud.



Whatever came that afternoon, I don’t know whether it was the product of my exhausted mind or something else entirely. It was enough to push my family to a new place.



I still hate that blue shirt.",27,1766465168.0,nosleep,0,0.94,False
1ptl0vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/1ptl0vl/national_gallerys_winter_count_exhibition_well/,National Gallery's Winter Count exhibition well worth seeing over the holidays,"Went to see the ""Winter Count: Embracing the Cold"" exhibition at the National Gallery here in Ottawa this weekend. I was looking forward to it -- and it was much better than I even expected.

It's a collection of paintings, photographs, an NFB video, a few sculptures and fabric art, and a fair amount of Indigenous clothing, all connected to winter, snow, and cold.

The artists have done a remarkable job of making winter beautiful, in an amazing number of ways.

If you want to talk name artists, there's Claude Monet (several paintings, including an extraordinary winter landscapes in white with touches of pink & gold), Gaugin, Alex Colville, Tom Thomson, Lawren Harris, JEH MacDonald and many more. There's some extraordinary Swedish and Finnish artists and many Canadians. A large and fascinating Indigenous component as well.

The largest percentage of the paintings are from the late 19th century to 1930s (both the Canadian and non-Canadian) though there was art from much earlier to the present day. I particularly liked the Abstract room, where winter landscapes were made almost geometric; others may prefer the more representational, and there was lots of that.

I was particularly amazed how many of the paintings I had never seen before, even though I knew the artists. The paintings were gathered from galleries and private collections across Canada, the U.S., and Europe. I was very glad to have seen these because I suspect I may never see these paintings again.

It's a huge exhibition which will take several hours to properly take in. You might want to take a break partway through (we had coffee/tea/muffins at the Gallery's cafe and found the food good & prices reasonable.)

I think I'm going to go back again in a month or so for a second look.

This year I thought I would change things up for Christmas and do a advent calendar, but my husband loathed it.

This year I used his list plus I added other gifts he has talked about. I got a garmin s44, magnetic phone holder, guitar picks, screen protector for the watch, pumps for coffee syrups, nespresso pods, golf balls, a Keychain that was a ""gift from our 6 mo,"" 2 coupons for a naughty time, a note that said ""nothing,"" car freshners, golf bag organizer, and dust gel for his truck. I thought I did good and was looking foward to making him happy, but he hated it from the start. His first complaint was, "" this is the most annoying way to get golf balls"" since I spaced them out throughout the calendar. He then was asked every night if he wanted to open a gift for him to reply , ""if you go grab the box for me."" On day 20 he lost his shit when he saw a note that just said ""nothing."" I thought writing nothing was cheeky and kinda funny since I made sure to have an extra gift on day 25 (he knew there was an extra gift), he took it as rude. I thought about it and realized I was wrong and I could've put a free hug or a kiss like he said, so I apologized. I explained to him I was hurt that he seemed to hate the whole advent calendar even before day 20 and that's when he hits me with a ""well if I was honest you didn't get me anything I wanted, everything I really want is over a thousand."" I'm just dumbfounded because I did buy the exact things off his list and added things he has talked about.

From a build perspective, this was a solo project focused on learning how to ship a full production app. I built it with Flutter for cross platform development, Firebase for auth, storage, and real time data, Google Maps for geolocation and pin handling, and RevenueCat for subscription management. One of the bigger challenges was handling location permissions correctly, filtering content by radius, and keeping the UX simple while still preventing spam and abuse.

Each request stays active for 24 hours.

The idea came from wanting to see places in real time through other people’s eyes. It could be your hometown, a beach, a street you miss, or somewhere you are curious about on the other side of the world.

It is still very early and community driven, but I wanted to share it and get real feedback from real users.

You can see how cracked out people act especially people who talk a lot 😭. Ive always been a good listener but like I said no caffeine has made me more chill in my energy so when I come across a person all wired on caffeine and they start rambling to me non stop it's like I wanna get away from them 😂😂. Because they could be talking for like 10 min straight hoping from one topic to another and i barley even said a word. I have a friend who has quit caffeine in the past before and we would have very chill deep conversations about a lot of things and it was a equal exchange in energy. Recently he started drinking caffeine again and the energy dynamic is so different. He's too wired too be around for too long compared to when he wasn't drinking caffeine I could chill a lot longer. Its like he talk forever but the moment someone interrupts what hes talking about he gets irritated immediately😡
 Caffeine makes your energy ugly.looking back now I remember a couple years ago I had this other friend who would drink cups of coffee everyday and it started becoming a toxic friendship because he would get easily offended over nothing and be starting arguments and leave me confused. Now I understand what it was.. Crazy how caffeine changes people's personalities. Its actually embarrassing looking back on times when I was all cracked out on caffeine and probably making people uncomfortable 😂🤦 ",5,1766464120.0,decaf,0,0.86,False

1ptknth,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptknth,Question about my daughter's autopsy,"Hi, I just finally looked at the final report after all this time since her death. I have learned quite a bit since her passing. She had drug and alcohol problems. But on the 19th of September 2019, she messaged my husband and said she was done with alcohol ""wish me luck, I'll see you in about 20 days. He wished her well then proceeded to cold turkey detox. She was dead by September 25. I live in Boston. She lived in Wisconsin at the time of death. She was married 25 years and had an 18 year old son. My daughter was hiding a lot of abuse. See this autopsy about"" cascading acute bruising on t floor"" why was this not questioned? Lacerations on right lower leg? No alcohol in tox screen but plenty of caffeine. I would imagine since she was dying in her bedroom on the floor on an air mattress with a hole in it she wasn't up making coffee where did all the caffeine come from I never got any answers. I never knew her husband to be abusive I did know that she was never attending on leaving him as he was her first boyfriend in her last. After she died he found another woman who was an alcoholic she lasted a year and then died but she died they say from cirrhosis Yes her liver was done along with her kidney and she had a brain bleed with a crack skull but they couldn't prove anything I have a lot of photos with a lot of bruises while my daughter was still alive I found them in her Instagram account I sent them to the police this is a small town in Wisconsin where everyone knows everyone The homicide detective is my son's best friend there's only four police and then other people that work for the law enforcement agency in that town it's mosinee Wisconsin in Central Wisconsin her father was the same way he died the same exact way and she died on his birthday weird later I wondered as the police were called many times to his house when he was alive from drinking if when they found her 4 years later dead from the same thing they just chalked it up to well there's another one that's gone from alcohol in that family I'm not sure she had a history but she was trying to detox but what I mainly concerned about is why didn't they question the cascading of acute bruising on the floor I think means where it happened. That's where she slept it must have been a crazy situation it was a 17 unit apartment complex her father left her in his will she was not able to take care of it from all the alcohol abuse and being sick constantly her husband worked a 40-hour job or son was 18 and could care less and he had just moved out on his own. I asked a lot of questions I have a before and after picture so you can see the difference that I never did see because she never turned her camera on when we did FaceTime until the last week of her life So if I can get any answers to those questions it would be appreciated I know it would just be a guess for you I'm just happy to have you look it over and also here's a picture of her before and the picture of her while she was sick and dying and wondering since there was 17 apartments there and must have been 17 cars there why did not one of them offer to take her to the hospital is beyond me I feel like there's something fishy going on and they covered it up or hit it and then finalized it I don't know but anyway here's a picture. I can't seem to post it in this post I will post another post right after this one with her pictures",6,1766464015.0,ForensicPathology,11,0.8,False

I use a WDT tool, followed by some kind of thing that sits on the puck holder to even it out and make sure it’s level, then use a spring-loaded press (also level) to compress the beans.

I buy specialty beans that are 2 to 4 weeks old at most. I would attribute it to the beans if not for the days when I get some super great shots, and then days where I get just alright shots.",1,1766463775.0,espresso,18,0.67,False
