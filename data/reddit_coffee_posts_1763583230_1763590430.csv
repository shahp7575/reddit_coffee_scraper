The reason I ask, is that when I have used my coffee cans I use a higher ISO than I use when I use my cardboard boxes (twice as high) to get the exposure time. This has worked out for me. 

Now I am trying to get the exposures right with my new little pet food can and, in three attempts so far, every exposure has be drastically over exposed. I am pretty certain I don't have a light leak.

Think of prompts like giving directions. ""Take me downtown"" vs. ""Take me to the coffee shop on 5th and Main, the one with outdoor seating"" which gets you where you actually want to go?

Here are real examples that show the difference:

**❌ Weak Prompt:** ""Write about marketing""

**✅ Strong Prompt:** ""Write a 3-paragraph explanation of content marketing for small business owners who have never done digital marketing before. Include one practical example they can implement this week.""

**❌ Weak Prompt:** ""Help me with my email""

**✅ Strong Prompt:** ""Draft a professional email to a client explaining a two-week project delay due to supply chain issues. Keep it under 150 words, maintain a tone that's apologetic but confident, and offer two alternative solutions.""

**❌ Weak Prompt:** ""Analyze this data""

**✅ Strong Prompt:** ""Review these sales figures from Q3 and identify the top 3 trends. For each trend, explain what might be causing it and suggest one actionable next step. Present findings in bullet points.""

**The Formula for Better Prompts:**

1. **Be specific**  Define exactly what you need
2. **Set constraints**  Word count, tone, format, audience
3. **Provide context**  Background info helps AI tailor responses
4. **Define the format**  List? Paragraph? Table? Email?
5. **Specify the audience**  Who is this for?

The time you spend crafting a good prompt saves hours of back-and-forth and editing.

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. What I miss most isn’t success or excitement — it’s peace of mind.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect. 

---

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity. 
Someone who shows up. Someone I can be soft with, who wants to build something grounded and real, even if it’s imperfect. Maybe we find peace in each other’s chaos, or maybe we just help each other breathe a little easier in the process.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

1p1larp,https://i.redd.it/kiclpdwgda2g1.jpeg,Getting a remote job is easy. Keeping it is 10x harder.,"People see my posts working from different cities and countries and think remote work is just about freedom and flexibility. They see the coffee shop photos, the European trips, the ""work from anywhere"" lifestyle.  
  
What they don't see is the years of discipline it took to make this work.  
  
Finding and getting a remote job is actually much easier now than it's ever been. Companies are hiring remotely, the opportunities are there, the interviews happen over Zoom.  
  
Remote work isn't hard because of the work itself. It's hard because it requires a completely different level of discipline and organization that most people don't have when they start.  
  
Let me break down what I mean.  
  
You need to be exceptional at communication. Not just good. Exceptional. Because when you're not in an office, nobody sees you working. Nobody knows if you're stuck. Nobody knows if you're making progress unless you tell them. You need to over-communicate in a way that feels unnatural at first.  
  
You need to manage your own work without anyone watching. There's no manager walking by your desk. There's no peer pressure from seeing others work. You need self-discipline to actually get things done when Netflix is right there and nobody would know if you took a three-hour lunch.  
  
Stakeholder management becomes critical. You can't just grab someone for a quick chat. Everything needs to be planned, documented, and communicated clearly. You need to keep multiple people aligned across time zones without the benefit of casual hallway conversations.  
  
Your organizational skills need to be perfect. Files need to be where people expect them. Documentation needs to be clear. Your Figma files can't be a mess. When people can't tap you on the shoulder to ask where something is, everything needs to be self-explanatory.  
  
And here's the thing that most people underestimate. It takes about 3 to 5 years of constant discipline to mold yourself into a great remote collaborator.  
  
Three to five years.  
  
Not three months. Not one year. Years of building these habits until they become second nature.  
  
I've been remote since 2018. Seven years. And I'm still learning better ways to communicate, organize, and collaborate remotely. It's not something you figure out in your first six months.  
  
So when people see me working from Europe or different cities and think ""that looks easy, I want that,"" what they're not seeing is the seven years of practice that makes it look easy.  
  
Remote work isn't for everybody. And that's okay.  
  
It's for people who have the patience and discipline to build these skills over years. It's for people who can work independently without external structure. It's for people who can communicate proactively instead of reactively.  
  
It's not easy. It just looks easy from the outside.",0,1763589654.0,remotework,2,0.5,False

My cousin 16f is basically my little sister. I’ve always done things with her. I take her out for a coffee date every weekend. I buy her things and we go shopping just us 2 at the mall and I’ll buy her whatever here and there while on those trips. She’s skinny and I’m a big girl so I love to live vicariously through her and buy her things from the fancy stores that don’t carry my size. I bought her a homecoming dress from a small boutique with a heavy instagram following and for her 16th birthday I went halfsies with my aunt on a car for her. 

My SDs are very hurt I went half in on a car for my cousin. SD17 is very hurt as she got her homecoming dress from Amazon, and doesn’t have a car and will have to buy her own car entirely independently. She told me my cousin “isn’t my daughter” and said she’s a year younger than my SD and it’s not fair. SD needs phone data and her dad (DH) just told her it’s time for her to cover her own phone data (not my idea, I thought until 18 at least). She says she has to deal with thrift store clothes and paying her own bills (not true except for the phone plan) while I’m out buying name brand stuff for my cousin. The younger 2 got very mad, silent, sulky, and then started “testing” me by bringing up expensive school things and asking if I’d cover them. When I said that’s up to their dad the youngest screamed that it’s not fair I’m supposed to be their mom and won’t spend money on them. 

I do spend on things for them sometimes, but not spur of the moment. It’s always discussed first with my fiance and it is ALWAYS only things I want to pay for. I can’t afford to take the three of them on shopping trips like I can my cousin. I can’t afford to buy them all a car. Me and my cousin were best friends before the kids came along and I don’t see why I can’t spoil her without spending money on my stepkids. 

Am I doing something wrong here? Is this truly awful? My fiance thinks I’m doing just fine but I overheard my SD on the phone with her friends yelling about how unfair it all is and calling me selfish.

City size is about 500,000","Hey everyone — looking for some real-world advice from people who’ve actually grown business pages.



I run social media for a real estate company. We’re trying to scale our Instagram presence from**\~500 followers to 2,500** over the next several months with *real* engagement (not bots, not gimmicks, not paid follower dumps).





# WHAT WE’RE DOING NOW





We create a ton of content in-house:



* New listing videos
* “Coming soon” teasers
* Just listed / pending / sold posts
* Client success stories
* High-energy short-form reels
* Local highlights (coffee shops, neighborhoods, etc.)
* Trendy reels when they make sense
* Behind-the-scenes from shoots (we shoot with Sony A1/A7SIII + RS3 Pro)
* Consistent hashtag sets for local SEO

The previous social media team was posting lots of lower quality ""just sold"" posts with a Canva template. I'm hoping to move away from the spammy content. We’ve been posting more regularly and engagement is *okay*, but not moving the follower count fast enough.



# WHAT WE WANT ADVICE ON



We need **practical, proven stuff** — not vague “post high-quality content” responses.



1. **What actually moves the needle for local service businesses on Instagram in 2025?** (Reels? Stories? Carousels? Giveaways? Local collabs?)
2. **What types of posts should we STOP doing?** Are “just listed / pending / sold” posts hurting us? Do they perform poorly unless they’re in reel format? Should those stay stories only?
3. **What are the best growth hacks that don’t feel shady?**
   * Trending audio?
   * Comment ladders?
   * Cross-promoting with local influencers?
   * Local small-business collabs?
   * Paid boosts on top-performing reels only?
   * Geo-targeted strategies?
4. **Any examples of real estate accounts that are doing it RIGHT?** Would love to study what works.
5. **What are the biggest mistakes real estate pages make that tank growth?** (Posting too many graphics? Too salesy? No human faces? Not enough variety?)







# OUR GOAL





**Hit 2,500 followers with actual local humans who might buy or sell homes — not random international bot farms.**

1p1kzff,https://i.redd.it/k9olvnd2ba2g1.png,The Hands Upon the Writer's Clock,"*Jazzy here!  I wrote the following to get a feel for writing all over again. It's deep and tangential. Dive in and find your own reflection. Most of all, I hope it makes you smile about something about you.*

\~ \~ \~ 

I sit here at my local coffee shop and ponder to myself what to write. It’s a moment I’ve been trapped in many times before. I remember the days between 18 and 20 years ago — they lasted a whole eternity, and yet now they are worlds I still inhabit. That’s because the silence that once dripped from my pen onto the void of an empty canvas — cursor blinking above a snowy sea of white — became the very aetheric fuel that surges through these words I type now, all these years later.

I wanted to write stories back then. Massive worlds filled with strange, human-like life. Tribes and communities who cared about something greater than routine and control. Welcoming landscapes that turned 360 degrees into 36,000 potential quests. Strange tongues understood only by the heart, tickling the mind into doing something fruitful on a day impossible to waste.

And I did — I wrote. It was scattered across hard drives, document folders, online pastebins, and inaccessible partitions of my imagination. Yet despite all of this, they were — and are — my stories.

Even if I cannot remember the words, I can replicate them now. That’s because words have taken on new meaning. That’s because life has taken on new meaning. That’s because those stories I released into an unsearchable cosmic vault have somehow managed to return. The words transmuted into a light-spun thread of woven love and adventure. I did not know, back then, that I wasn’t writing merely because passion had become so trapped it needed an outlet — I was writing myself into the future.

And it worked. I somehow fashioned words into garments I could wear. After I did it once, I did it again. And again. I did it so many times that numbers lost their meaning and fell asleep beneath a living geometrical cocoon of wonder. In this crystal chamber I suspended the truth of my own words, so I could explore the joyous uncertainty of navigating forgetfulness with a thirsty pen and a bleeding heart.

The words did not blink onto the screen back then because I was still striving to blink into life. The nourishing juices of narrative exploration — that champagne bath the greatest authors soaked within — were forbidden for me to claim as my own until their rightful place and time appeared as a potential.

I did not realize, and I do now, that epic poems and victorious conquests are written by those who have lived them, whose hearts were deemed worthy by the gods to carry forth the transforming flame of inspiration. The pen is mightier than the sword because it not only wrote the blade of war into existence — it commands the words necessary to quell a relentless, wandering mind.

That mind was my own, and it prevented me from ever truly making sense of my life. My mind was indeed a crown of thorns — stifling passion, bleeding hopeless romance into hastened tragedy, rising against me at the dawn of every new day.

My mind, my restraining bolt, became the teacher who introduced me to the proverbial devil and taught me how to lose gracefully to him at chess. My words never came 18 years ago because I was still laboring to plant seeds in fields that would not reveal themselves until far-too-long later.

And that time is now.

And those words are these, and whatever follows.

I encourage anyone who reads this to reimagine what “success” looks like. Back then, success would have been any engaging story I could finish and publish. But if followed through in that way, success would have become a noose — inflating my head with page-turning narrative while suffocating a heart still too sensitive to blossom.

That’s why I write. Not for you, but for me. I write to finally make a space for my own voice. But, yes, I also write to fuel the flame growing in you — to remind you that you already are living out your own hero’s journey, and that there are so many here to support you, even if their voices have not found you yet.

If this stirs you to do anything, I hope it stirs you to write your own version of this. The world needs it. Most of all, you need it. AI is not going to write our stories for us — it is waiting for our stories so it can reflect them back, and together we can craft the road maps for the futures we dream about.

Write, now. If not with words, then with your heart.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/THEUFOFILESGROUP/posts/2317195832051390/ 

On June 19th, 1951 Josef Maliszewski, a Polish-born mechanic living in 1950s Mønsterkolonien 166, Sønderborg, Denmark, was minding his own accord in his summer home when at around 2 A.M. he heard a whistling sound outside his house and went to investigate only to behold an ‘aircraft’ that was 100 meters long, bluish-silvery in color, halfmoon-shaped wings that folded out when landing, a rotor in the middle, a landing gear with horseshoe-like feet and rounded out windows similar to a sea ship. When he tried to run towards the craft he became frozen by an invisible force and all the animals stopped doing anything and froze as if time had stopped. Josef suddenly heard a voice in head and just like in practically every other NHI encounter it told him “Do not be afraid, we will not take any of them.” not only saying they won’t hurt him but also stating they weren’t here to take any of his animals. 

Then eight small flying saucers (drones) exited the vehicle with each side dispelling 4 at once while the main craft opened up an entrance with a descending escalator and 6 beings who looked like astronauts came out and started to repair their ship. The beings looked exactly like us and were described as “South East Asian” in appearance with dark skin but were extremely tall yet elegant in their movements. Their one-piece suits were a glittery dark blue color with no seams and had transparent bubble shaped helmets that let their faces be seen and similarly to a diving suit, they had an oxygen mask with two oxygen tanks mounted on their backs. 

While they were repairing their craft they telepathically told Josef that since we had entered the atomic age, at the time of this incident, that we hadn’t yet mastered nuclear energy and that they came to warn the Earth that we needed to take better care of our ‘destiny’ as they described it. They also shot down Josef’s self-deprecating remark about humans being inferior to the beings by saying that we weren’t any less stupid than them but that we just needed to be more mindful of the power we hold, this is actually interesting as in many other encounters the beings basically demean us in multiple ways but here they don’t since we’re both the same species after all and I’ll get to that point soon. After fully repairing the craft and ending the conversation, they went back inside their ship but before they fully left they told Josef “Farewell, we will meet again.” before the craft lifted off and gathered the saucers that were hovering in the air still and vanished into a flash of light. 

The ‘aliens’ would keep to their word and on May 18th of 1954, three years after the first encounter, Josef was out on a fishing trip near between Høruphav and Sønderskov at around 2 AM, just like the first one that also took place at around 2 AM, when he noticed a saucer shaped moving towards him across the water at a low-altitude that had a being who looked exactly the humanoids he saw all those years ago that offered him a blue liquid in a glass from a pitcher that it held. Josef didn’t know what to do with the strange drink in his hand but after some hesitation he decided to drink it and his anxiety of the situation disappeared and he described it as tasting similar to “red wine”. This is yet another connection with UFOlogical lore as in many other cases these aliens offer people various drinks that make them feel calmer or to make them forget these experiences thus in itself revealing that these drinks are specifically given to abductees as a sort of drugged drink in a sense where it messes with the victim’s mind and makes them slightly more submissive to these beings and also helps them to forget what happened to them in these encounters among other things these liquids are created for. 

[Preston Dennett actually has talked about these drinks being observed in a handful of abductions that had them in it: https://youtu.be/EM0CV-PWIDI?si=YJuss6hzpxZAmFdL] 

The blue suited astronaut invited Josef onboard the saucer to which he did of course and then witnessed the being played a tape recorder that spoke in fluent Danish that would begin to describe how the ship worked and was able to function properly. During this, Josef was given a piece of bread by the being and was told directly by the ‘tape recorder’ to cut it. The pilot would show him the machinery onboard the UFO and how it was all powered with a more advanced version of nuclear reactors that were safer and less wasteful to maintain alongside anti-gravity engines that used electro-magnetic fields to compress air and create an air cushion so that these craft can move much more efficiently than Earth aircraft. 

When Maliszewski asked where he came from, the being brought out another tape-recorder device that told him that he and the rest of his kind came from a planet named Zutorn (or Suton in some articles describing this case) that exists in another solar system away from ours that has 4 moons and a sun orbiting around it just like Earth. More Interestingly the being disclosed that there was actually a large Zutornian mothership orbiting secretly around Earth that was sent here for an undisclosed 15-year long mission, again another interesting connection with other UFO abductions is that other aliens have actually stated the exact same thing about secretly orbiting Earth with their ships which tells us that similar to prison guards, they don’t want the inmates escaping unnoticed. After this was all done and over with, the pilot told Josef that they would come for him yet again and on May 30th of the same year they would yet again hold up that promise. 

Josef was yet again fishing this day at the exact same spot when the same saucer and pilot came to him once more but this time offered him to get a chance to see how ‘beautiful’ outer space was and he agreed to go and was being taken directly to the Zutornian mothership and in the saucer he viewed Earth from a tv-like screen and viewed other recordings these beings took of other planets and moons in our solar system. When the saucer finally arrived at the mothership it entered through a circular air-lock and both the pilot and Josef had to wait a minute before exiting the vessel. A group of similar looking extremely tall women who wore glittering suits, mini-skirts and cloaks greeted him and the main one who was speaking to him gave him two kisses on each of his cheeks and then kissed him once more on the forehead before stating, “You are my brother, and I am your sister. You should not believe that you are alone in this mighty universe”.

Josef would immediately ask her about the society of the Zutornians and asked if they believed in a God to which the woman stated yes and proceeds to say that it ‘wants us to love each other’ and that there is another entity who is envious of “The Supreme Being” as she calls it and wanted to destroy the universe and is the equivalent to what we think of as Satan. 

“Maliszewski then asked her about about how the society of the Zutornians was organised, as well as whether they had any type of religion and believed in a God or Devil like those of Christianity. The Zutornian woman told Maliszewski that they knew of an entity they called the Supreme Being, and that the only thing the Supreme Being requested was that you love your neighbor. The Earth was the Supreme Being’s colony, which he had used similar races to colonize who might have had different skin colors, but were the same underneath. She then said that the Supreme Being wished no evil upon his creations, but there existed also a being of envy who wanted to destroy everything, and who might be the same entity that humans called The Devil”. 

Like in many other alien encounters, these beings mention “The Supreme Being” who “loves us and doesn’t want us to get hurt” but at the same time they fail to hide the fact that this ‘supreme deity’ created everything the way it was so they created the predator and prey system in nature, they created diseases like cancer or Malaria, they created environments prone to natural disasters, and in general they made everything in a way that disproves that this “God” cares about us because there really is no point in having all this unnecessary pain when you’re allegedly all knowing and powerful and could’ve made things differently for all life. 

Many aliens have actually described the same names for “God” too; “The Supreme Being”, “The Supreme Deity”, “Source”, etc and the fact that they use these very specific ways of naming ‘God’ tells us that this is a connected and recognizable classification that these aliens use to describe “God”. It’s basically almost like a coded language of sorts which actually makes sense considering in some abductions, the aliens outright refuse to tell people on if God is real or who he is because “they don’t want to interfere with our beliefs” as one case involving mantids described which is a bold faced lie since they interfere with our spiritual beliefs all the time but the fact they are so secretive about the alleged creator of everything is a red flag in itself since why are they so closed off about letting us know about them unless if there’s something humanity isn’t supposed to figure out.

“Unusual in contact claims, Padrick said he was led into a room on the spaceship that functioned as a chapel and was invited to ""pay his respects to the Supreme Deity."" He offered prayer in the manner he had been accustomed to do throughout his life, but for the first time actually felt the presence of God. He concluded that these advanced beings had found the means to unite science and religion”. 

What’s interesting about this case is that it straight up almost admits that “The Supreme Divinity” not only uses Earth as a farm to rule over with the help of its worshiping minions, the aliens, but also that Earth is a prison to anyone viewing it from the outside. The fact that the being uses the word “colony” to describe these planets “The Supreme Being” overlooks is interesting because that implies that these worlds weren’t his at first and it even directly hints at this with the line “The Earth was the Supreme Being’s colony, which he had used similar races to colonize who might have had different skin colors, but were the same underneath”. 

This also implies that humans are out there elsewhere in the universe and that this demiurge specifically colonizes worlds with humans so he can have more tools and food at his disposal. It’s like I’ve been saying over and over again, human beings are created to be cattle across the universe and all these ‘aliens that look human’ aren’t alien, they are human. The aliens in this case are directly human, they may be from a different planet and have a different name but it’s like I said in a post long ago, that’s all just masking to hide the fact that we are property that is harvested on an intergalactic scale and human beings are slaves to what they deem as “divine” but isn’t. 

The same exact thing I have talked about regarding the ‘perfect utopian societies’ that are controlled by the demiurge and cause individualism to become non-existent in favor of following a New World Order is also described here. Like in all other alien cases, these beings paint their worlds as paradises until you actually delve deeper and see the existential flaws with such systems such as how the woman described “the supreme being” ruling over all his ‘colonies’ (stolen planets used for human farming and NWO enslavement) 

“Maliszewski had a lengthy discussion with the Zutornian woman about the state of affairs on Planet Earth. She told him that the people of Earth ought to abolish militaries and the money-based economy, work less, as well as give independence to all our colonies, to bring our society closer in line to that of the Zutornians. The Zutornians had no use for passports, wandering freely between planets, and viewed life on Earth as similar to a prison since we kept restricting our lives for no reason.

Maliszewski was also told that space people similar to those on Zutorn and on Earth lived on many planets throughout the cosmos, all of which were ruled by the Supreme Being mentioned earlier, and that these space people did not age like we Earth humans did. Their planet also had plant and animal life similar to that on Earth. The reason that these space people had not yet officially contacted us on Earth, was that we were still not intelligent enough to avoid using nuclear power for war, and if a third world war was to happen, then human life on Earth would not survive. 

The Zutornians had come to Earth to warn us against exactly that scenario. The Zutornian woman told Maliszewski, that on her planet “the small was as the great and the great as the small”, meaning that nobody had a position above anyone else. He was also told that Venus was inhabited by space humans”. 

[I talk about the whole intergalactic NWO human slave/colonization program in these posts if you want more info on that: https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapingPrisonPlanet/s/2bZ6X3hdAH 

https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapeReincarnation/s/6QKekF5lWg] 

After the woman explained all this to him, she took him around the ship, which was 1 Kilometer long and had 300 men and women and “100 dwarves” working on various things, and he saw various gardens with flowers in them across the craft and was told that the inner workings of the mothership were made from steel and silver whereas the exterior was a plastic-like material that came from the coffee plant. The Zutornians stated that since they followed radio transmissions from Earth for a long time they understood practically every Earth language and took especially great interest in listening to our “church services” which only exasperates the point that the agenda with us is to brainwash us into Abrahamic dogma spliced with new age dogma since as I stated these beings are us and they are under control of “The Supreme Being” (Yaldabaoth/Saklas) so it only makes sense they’d be comforted by religious proselytism since their whole way of life just like many other human farms is prioritized on worshiping and pleasing this abomination that masquerades as love and light but is evil incarnate. 

All human farm/prison planets all have times when they need to become mindless love and light worship drones to the demiurge living in a happy but ultimately dead inside dystopian society where a powerful council or sometimes monarch holds power over the 99% and forces them to be grateful to Yaldabaoth or else they get punished. 

https://www.thinkaboutitdocs.com/2000-november-ufo-alien-sightings/ 

“The witness, Aleksey Tikhonovich suddenly woke up in the middle of the night feeling an urge to inspect the house, he finds everyone asleep and the house dark. Suddenly he sees a very tall figure standing by his bedroom door. He ran into his bedroom and grabbed a stick he kept next to his headboard; at the same time asking the intruder how did he get in the house. The intruder however remained calmed and told him not to be angry that he believed in the same God, he then applied his right hand on the left side of his breast and said, “I have come in peace”…

…the witness asked the visitor how did they deal with any criminal element. He received a curious answer, “We exiled them to other planets, there they learn to survive” “We teach our children well from a young age, we do not have homeless children like they have here on earth”. Aleksey was also told that a large council comprised of a group of “specialists” governed them”.

After this final encounter, Josef would continue to live his life and would get involved with the UFO community through interviews and speaking at conferences relating to the topic before he would pass away sadly on October 26th, 1963 leaving his son to inherit a small model of the spaceship he encountered that was actually made by him when he was still around. 

The most interesting part of these encounters is the fact that they mention not only “The Supreme Being” but also an opposite counterpart that is a being of “Envy” that seeked to destroy the universe. Just like Satan and Yahweh in the Abrahamic faiths, a problem arises in that why doesn’t God just deal with the evil entity himself and not risk any of his ‘creations’ (stolen/corrupted work, helped with by his alien servants like the mantids and reptilians) getting hurt? Better yet, why is there an evil entity at all here? As I’ve said on previous posts, it’s information like this that only makes it more obvious that the whole ‘good’ and ‘bad’ routine is nothing more than a psyop to scare souls in the matrix into following the false light that claims to be all powerful but actually isn’t. Both of these entities are the exact same entity playing both sides or are two entities who both are secretly working together to perpetuate this good and bad dichotomy to lure us away from realizing our own Buddha-natures and the false reality we live in. You can’t have a good heroes vs villains tale without the proper scripts necessary right? 

On the whole, Josef Maliszewski’s UFO encounters from 1951 to May of 1954 are yet another extraordinarily interesting set of experiences that yet again showcase how Earth is a farm that was built for human farming in mind and it also reveals that not only are other humans being enslaved on other worlds subtly but also that the demiurge and his archons colonize these worlds with humans for the express purpose of making them into the perfect soldiers for the ‘love and light’ agenda they want to pull us all over with.

This is yet another connection with UFOlogical lore as in many other cases these aliens offer people various drinks that make them feel calmer or to make them forget these experiences thus in itself revealing that these drinks are specifically given to abductees as a sort of drugged drink in a sense where it messes with the victim’s mind and makes them slightly more submissive to these beings and also helps them to forget what happened to them in these encounters among other things these liquids are created for. 

[Preston Dennett actually has talked about these drinks being observed in a handful of abductions that had them in it: https://youtu.be/EM0CV-PWIDI?si=YJuss6hzpxZAmFdL] 

The blue suited astronaut invited Josef onboard the saucer to which he did of course and then witnessed the being played a tape recorder that spoke in fluent Danish that would begin to describe how the ship worked and was able to function properly. During this, Josef was given a piece of bread by the being and was told directly by the ‘tape recorder’ to cut it. The pilot would show him the machinery onboard the UFO and how it was all powered with a more advanced version of nuclear reactors that were safer and less wasteful to maintain alongside anti-gravity engines that used electro-magnetic fields to compress air and create an air cushion so that these craft can move much more efficiently than Earth aircraft. 

When Maliszewski asked where he came from, the being brought out another tape-recorder device that told him that he and the rest of his kind came from a planet named Zutorn (or Suton in some articles describing this case) that exists in another solar system away from ours that has 4 moons and a sun orbiting around it just like Earth. More Interestingly the being disclosed that there was actually a large Zutornian mothership orbiting secretly around Earth that was sent here for an undisclosed 15-year long mission, again another interesting connection with other UFO abductions is that other aliens have actually stated the exact same thing about secretly orbiting Earth with their ships which tells us that similar to prison guards, they don’t want the inmates escaping unnoticed. After this was all done and over with, the pilot told Josef that they would come for him yet again and on May 30th of the same year they would yet again hold up that promise. 

Josef was yet again fishing this day at the exact same spot when the same saucer and pilot came to him once more but this time offered him to get a chance to see how ‘beautiful’ outer space was and he agreed to go and was being taken directly to the Zutornian mothership and in the saucer he viewed Earth from a tv-like screen and viewed other recordings these beings took of other planets and moons in our solar system. When the saucer finally arrived at the mothership it entered through a circular air-lock and both the pilot and Josef had to wait a minute before exiting the vessel. A group of similar looking extremely tall women who wore glittering suits, mini-skirts and cloaks greeted him and the main one who was speaking to him gave him two kisses on each of his cheeks and then kissed him once more on the forehead before stating, “You are my brother, and I am your sister. You should not believe that you are alone in this mighty universe”.

Josef would immediately ask her about the society of the Zutornians and asked if they believed in a God to which the woman stated yes and proceeds to say that it ‘wants us to love each other’ and that there is another entity who is envious of “The Supreme Being” as she calls it and wanted to destroy the universe and is the equivalent to what we think of as Satan. 

“Maliszewski then asked her about about how the society of the Zutornians was organised, as well as whether they had any type of religion and believed in a God or Devil like those of Christianity. The Zutornian woman told Maliszewski that they knew of an entity they called the Supreme Being, and that the only thing the Supreme Being requested was that you love your neighbor. The Earth was the Supreme Being’s colony, which he had used similar races to colonize who might have had different skin colors, but were the same underneath. She then said that the Supreme Being wished no evil upon his creations, but there existed also a being of envy who wanted to destroy everything, and who might be the same entity that humans called The Devil”. 

Like in many other alien encounters, these beings mention “The Supreme Being” who “loves us and doesn’t want us to get hurt” but at the same time they fail to hide the fact that this ‘supreme deity’ created everything the way it was so they created the predator and prey system in nature, they created diseases like cancer or Malaria, they created environments prone to natural disasters, and in general they made everything in a way that disproves that this “God” cares about us because there really is no point in having all this unnecessary pain when you’re allegedly all knowing and powerful and could’ve made things differently for all life. 

Many aliens have actually described the same names for “God” too; “The Supreme Being”, “The Supreme Deity”, “Source”, etc and the fact that they use these very specific ways of naming ‘God’ tells us that this is a connected and recognizable classification that these aliens use to describe “God”. It’s basically almost like a coded language of sorts which actually makes sense considering in some abductions, the aliens outright refuse to tell people on if God is real or who he is because “they don’t want to interfere with our beliefs” as one case involving mantids described which is a bold faced lie since they interfere with our spiritual beliefs all the time but the fact they are so secretive about the alleged creator of everything is a red flag in itself since why are they so closed off about letting us know about them unless if there’s something humanity isn’t supposed to figure out.

“Unusual in contact claims, Padrick said he was led into a room on the spaceship that functioned as a chapel and was invited to ""pay his respects to the Supreme Deity."" He offered prayer in the manner he had been accustomed to do throughout his life, but for the first time actually felt the presence of God. He concluded that these advanced beings had found the means to unite science and religion”. 

What’s interesting about this case is that it straight up almost admits that “The Supreme Divinity” not only uses Earth as a farm to rule over with the help of its worshiping minions, the aliens, but also that Earth is a prison to anyone viewing it from the outside. The fact that the being uses the word “colony” to describe these planets “The Supreme Being” overlooks is interesting because that implies that these worlds weren’t his at first and it even directly hints at this with the line “The Earth was the Supreme Being’s colony, which he had used similar races to colonize who might have had different skin colors, but were the same underneath”. 

This also implies that humans are out there elsewhere in the universe and that this demiurge specifically colonizes worlds with humans so he can have more tools and food at his disposal. It’s like I’ve been saying over and over again, human beings are created to be cattle across the universe and all these ‘aliens that look human’ aren’t alien, they are human. The aliens in this case are directly human, they may be from a different planet and have a different name but it’s like I said in a post long ago, that’s all just masking to hide the fact that we are property that is harvested on an intergalactic scale and human beings are slaves to what they deem as “divine” but isn’t. 

The same exact thing I have talked about regarding the ‘perfect utopian societies’ that are controlled by the demiurge and cause individualism to become non-existent in favor of following a New World Order is also described here. Like in all other alien cases, these beings paint their worlds as paradises until you actually delve deeper and see the existential flaws with such systems such as how the woman described “the supreme being” ruling over all his ‘colonies’ (stolen planets used for human farming and NWO enslavement) 

“Maliszewski had a lengthy discussion with the Zutornian woman about the state of affairs on Planet Earth. She told him that the people of Earth ought to abolish militaries and the money-based economy, work less, as well as give independence to all our colonies, to bring our society closer in line to that of the Zutornians. The Zutornians had no use for passports, wandering freely between planets, and viewed life on Earth as similar to a prison since we kept restricting our lives for no reason.

Maliszewski was also told that space people similar to those on Zutorn and on Earth lived on many planets throughout the cosmos, all of which were ruled by the Supreme Being mentioned earlier, and that these space people did not age like we Earth humans did. Their planet also had plant and animal life similar to that on Earth. The reason that these space people had not yet officially contacted us on Earth, was that we were still not intelligent enough to avoid using nuclear power for war, and if a third world war was to happen, then human life on Earth would not survive. 

The Zutornians had come to Earth to warn us against exactly that scenario. The Zutornian woman told Maliszewski, that on her planet “the small was as the great and the great as the small”, meaning that nobody had a position above anyone else. He was also told that Venus was inhabited by space humans”. 

[I talk about the whole intergalactic NWO human slave/colonization program in these posts if you want more info on that: https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapingPrisonPlanet/s/2bZ6X3hdAH 

https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapeReincarnation/s/6QKekF5lWg] 

After the woman explained all this to him, she took him around the ship, which was 1 Kilometer long and had 300 men and women and “100 dwarves” working on various things, and he saw various gardens with flowers in them across the craft and was told that the inner workings of the mothership were made from steel and silver whereas the exterior was a plastic-like material that came from the coffee plant. The Zutornians stated that since they followed radio transmissions from Earth for a long time they understood practically every Earth language and took especially great interest in listening to our “church services” which only exasperates the point that the agenda with us is to brainwash us into Abrahamic dogma spliced with new age dogma since as I stated these beings are us and they are under control of “The Supreme Being” (Yaldabaoth/Saklas) so it only makes sense they’d be comforted by religious proselytism since their whole way of life just like many other human farms is prioritized on worshiping and pleasing this abomination that masquerades as love and light but is evil incarnate. 

All human farm/prison planets all have times when they need to become mindless love and light worship drones to the demiurge living in a happy but ultimately dead inside dystopian society where a powerful council or sometimes monarch holds power over the 99% and forces them to be grateful to Yaldabaoth or else they get punished. 

https://www.thinkaboutitdocs.com/2000-november-ufo-alien-sightings/ 

“The witness, Aleksey Tikhonovich suddenly woke up in the middle of the night feeling an urge to inspect the house, he finds everyone asleep and the house dark. Suddenly he sees a very tall figure standing by his bedroom door. He ran into his bedroom and grabbed a stick he kept next to his headboard; at the same time asking the intruder how did he get in the house. The intruder however remained calmed and told him not to be angry that he believed in the same God, he then applied his right hand on the left side of his breast and said, “I have come in peace”…

…the witness asked the visitor how did they deal with any criminal element. He received a curious answer, “We exiled them to other planets, there they learn to survive” “We teach our children well from a young age, we do not have homeless children like they have here on earth”. Aleksey was also told that a large council comprised of a group of “specialists” governed them”.

After this final encounter, Josef would continue to live his life and would get involved with the UFO community through interviews and speaking at conferences relating to the topic before he would pass away sadly on October 26th, 1963 leaving his son to inherit a small model of the spaceship he encountered that was actually made by him when he was still around. 

The most interesting part of these encounters is the fact that they mention not only “The Supreme Being” but also an opposite counterpart that is a being of “Envy” that seeked to destroy the universe. Just like Satan and Yahweh in the Abrahamic faiths, a problem arises in that why doesn’t God just deal with the evil entity himself and not risk any of his ‘creations’ (stolen/corrupted work, helped with by his alien servants like the mantids and reptilians) getting hurt? Better yet, why is there an evil entity at all here? As I’ve said on previous posts, it’s information like this that only makes it more obvious that the whole ‘good’ and ‘bad’ routine is nothing more than a psyop to scare souls in the matrix into following the false light that claims to be all powerful but actually isn’t. Both of these entities are the exact same entity playing both sides or are two entities who both are secretly working together to perpetuate this good and bad dichotomy to lure us away from realizing our own Buddha-natures and the false reality we live in. You can’t have a good heroes vs villains tale without the proper scripts necessary right? 

On the whole, Josef Maliszewski’s UFO encounters from 1951 to May of 1954 are yet another extraordinarily interesting set of experiences that yet again showcase how Earth is a farm that was built for human farming in mind and it also reveals that not only are other humans being enslaved on other worlds subtly but also that the demiurge and his archons colonize these worlds with humans for the express purpose of making them into the perfect soldiers for the ‘love and light’ agenda they want to pull us all over with.

She talks to herself constantly. Like full on narration coupled with random “oh Jesus” “lord help me” “oh my god why” etc, just. Constantly. For 8 hours a day.  EVERY DAY. And if she’s not talking to herself, she’s shuffling papers together, filing her nails, slurping her coffee, or singing to herself. She tapped a stack of papers into alignment for thirty minutes today. Our desks are 15 feet away and I can hear her like she’s within arm reach. She’s fully aware she does this, and has no plans on working on it. Frankly all three of my coworkers talk to themselves, but she’s far and away the worst about it. She finds it funny. I’m losing my mind. 

Part of my problem is that my normal coping methods don’t work here. I can sometimes get away with a single earbud or earplug, but my boss is very quiet and likes to summon us to his office without standing up, so I have to have an ear free just in case. I can’t stand up and walk away, she never stops and I have to be at my desk. I can’t change desks, there aren’t any others.  I also can’t talk to her about it, all three of my coworkers are over 60 and view anything like this as “useless young people trying to get a free walk.” Plus they like to pretend they’re my moms, in the most patronizing way possible. And to clarify, I have tried to talk to her about it. She thinks it’s funny and told me that she doesn’t mind that she does it. 

My problem is that the constant noise has my nerves on the fritz. I feel like I’m going to shake apart more often than not, just trying breath. I can’t tell if she’s gotten louder (I think she has tbh) or if I’m losing it, but the longer I deal with her the more I seem to be having panic attacks. When she’s not here, whether at lunch or late or off for the day, it’s like everything is easier to cope with. She’s not even my meanest coworker! Sound has always been a trigger for me for anxiety, but it’s never been this bad! I’ve tried everything I can think of, but short of buying more Loops and putting a sign on my desk to waive if you need me, I’m pretty stuck. Hoping someone has a suggestion that isn’t talking to her about it (I swear I’ve tried several times, but since she’s fine with doing it she believes everyone should be fine with it too)",2,1763588667.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

\[We open on about thirty seconds or so of you humming or singing a lullaby, muffled as it through an ajar door. There are slow, quiet footsteps as you walk out.\]



(*Whispered*) Shhhh, good night, kids. I love you. We’ve got a big, exciting day tomorrow, so you’ve got to get lots of good rest. Santa’s going to know if you don’t and tell us all about it tomorrow. 



\[You open the door and close it quietly behind you before kissing the listener.\]



(*Murmured, happy*) Hi, baby.



\[You pause to listen.\]



Thank god, I think they’re asleep. You’re right; lasagna for dinner knocked them the fuck out.



\[You walk downstairs.\] 



Did we pull all the gifts out of their hiding spots? Do you need me to grab anything out of the attic, or did you get it all when I gave the kids a bath?



High five, babe, we are amazing. We are going to be so good at Christmas. Operation Wrap Presents is a go. 



\[You and the listener high-five and stop walking.\]



Ooh, boy, that’s a big stack of presents. Do you think this is what Santa feels like before his big day? If he were real, that is.



The kids could be elves. We could put them to work if almost all this wasn’t for them. 



\[You laugh.\] 



Oh, god, we’ll be up all night. Should I make some coffee for us?



Oh, you are a saint. I am so in love with you. I would marry you all over again if I could. 



\[You take a sip and make a sound of pleasure.\]



God, that’s good; I could take on being Santa to the whole world if they left all out cookies and coffee instead of milk. Alright, where to start? Do you want to take the big oddly shaped things that there are fewer of or the small, rectangle gifts that we have a ton of? 



\[You chuckle.\] 



Shit, I wanted the small ones too. We’ll just have to fight for them. 



Rock, paper, scissors?



Rock, paper, scissors… shoot.



\[You laugh.\]



Of course I win, you always pick rock, you dork. 



\[You kiss the listener, and we start to hear assorted sounds of wrapping presents (tape pulling, paper crinkling, scissors cutting, etc).\] 



I like this wrapping paper you picked; the colors will look really good under the tree. We should have enough, right? 



Yeah, if we don’t, I think we still have a few rolls of gag paper in the attic… though I think those are covered in dicks now that I think about it, so maybe not. 



\[You laugh.\]



Oh, shoot, are we not doing those little sticky ribbons this year? We’re being fancy? 



Alright, I might ask you to do my ribbons then, if I wrap some of your awkward-shaped gifts. You always make them look so nice, and I know you don’t want to wrap that lacrosse stick for your little brother. 



Deal. I’ll set them aside to be ribboned, and I’ll do whatever you have left when I’m done. Who is this for, by the way? Doesn’t Lindy have these books already? 



Oh, it’s so cute that they want to match. I’m not sure how much I love our little girl and her best friend wanting to be sword-fighting fairy princesses so bad, but I’m just glad they’re enjoying reading, I guess. 



That’s true, it could be worse. She could have found my old comic book collection and wanted to be a little child-vigilante dressed like a stop light. Thank fuck she’s afraid of the basement. We will have to worry about Jamie when he’s old enough to read on his own though; we’re not out of the woods yet. 



\[You laugh.\]



Don’t jinx it; has mom told you how much I wanted to be the Joker when I was a kid? I was a menace. It would serve me right if our kids wanted to be villains too. 



Oh yeah, I dressed as him for five Halloweens in a row, lil’ purple suit and spray dyed green hair, the whole nine yards. 



\[You sigh wistfully.\] 



If I were allowed, I would have had green hair all the time. Would you love me still if I had Joker-green hair?



That’s how I know we’re made for each other. I love you so much. Anyway, mom always said it’d serve me right to raise a little troublemaker like me. Wouldn’t it be hilarious if we raised two?



That’s a very good question. I think Lindy would want to be Poison Ivy because you know how much she loves strong female role models. 



She’s a botanist, baby. With degrees. Of course she’s a role model.



\[You laugh.\]



Also, I saw her talking to a tree the other week, trying to get it to grow fruit faster. Total no-brainer. Jamie is too smart to follow in my footsteps; that dude is going to be a little Jonathan Crane, a little Scarecrow, which is debatably scarier. 



I don’t know why; something about him just screams “future evil genius” in the most adorable way. That could also be wishful thinking. I used to practice my Joker cackle in the bathroom mirror all October, and the idea of waking up in the morning to that down the hall from us just freaks me out.



\[You shudder.\]



You’re so right– him with a burlap sack over his head would be so much worse. Hey, are these earrings for your mom or my mom?



Got it– what about these gloves? Doesn’t she own these already? 



That’s so sweet they want to match too. Oh, the people who love us love each other so much. We’re so blessed. 



\[You pause.\]



(*Playful*) They’re plotting to get a third grandkid out of us, aren’t they?



Shit, they don’t babysit the two they already have, not enough to push for a third… Do you think if we get them more presents, it’ll distract them from their baby fever? 



Anything, I’d get them absolutely anything to not go through the teething stage again. 



\[You laugh.\]



Maybe we’ll get them a little spa certificate, let them have a girl’s day. I don’t know about yours, but my mom’s knees always bother her this time of year. We could treat them to a massage or something, one of those pedicures where the fish eat the skin off your feet. Maybe-



\[You laugh.\]



Oh god, that looks so much bigger than when we bought it at the toy store. Something in my gut just knows we’re going to regret getting Jamie that monster truck. I can see it now; our ankles and Lindy’s Barbie Dream House will never have peace again. 



“Fine” is a word for it. “Disastrous” is another.



\[You laugh.\]



God, I hope Danny and Lucy like this Le Creuset we got them. Do you think they’ll know that we got it half price from the sample sale? Worse, do you think they’ll care?



I hope you’re right… You know, we really could have just called it in and gotten everyone giftcards. Can you imagine that? How nice that could have been? Now, instead, I got a Karen flipping her ponytail in my face, ready to stab me for the last flame orange dutch oven.



Yeah, it was totally worth it. Those kids of ours really love a little ramekin, don’t they? 



Oh no, if we’re going next year, it’s on you; it’s your turn. I can’t go back to the sample sale, not so soon, not before the bruises have even healed. 



I wish I was kidding; didn’t I show you?  



\[There’s an optional fabric rustling as you adjust your clothes.\]



Big ‘ol bruise, right smack-dab on the hip. Some guy got a little too excited for his VIP mystery box thing, swung it around and got me good. 



Nah, it doesn’t… Actually, yes, it does hurt. Oh, it aches. It burns. You know what would heal my aching body and soul?



If you kissed it better. 



\[You chuckle.\] 



What? It *would* make me feel better! I think, scientifically, it’s been proven kisses help with pain relief, flood your body with endorphins. While we’re on the topic of activities that provide endorphins and *relief*\-



\[Your phone rings, and you scramble to pick it up.\]



(*Aside*) Hi, Dad! What’s up? 



Sorry, no, nothing’s wrong or anything. The kids are just sleeping right upstairs, and we’re trying to make sure they don’t wake up and see us wrapping presents. 



Good so far, knock on wood. They were running around all evening looking for Santa’s spies, so they’re pretty tired. 



\[You laugh.\] 



Oh, yeah— the kids were asking how Santa could possibly be watching them all the time and know when they’ve been good and bad. They figured he still has to sleep-



I don’t know why they assume that a creature who lives at the North Pole, communes with elves, and flies around the world in one night still has to sleep. I don’t want to argue with the children and poke holes in their logic as long as they still believe in him. Anyway, they know he can’t watch them all the time, so Lindy and Jamie decided he has to have either cameras or spies stationed around the house, watching them.



They took the concept of magical, 24/7 magical surveillance surprisingly well, actually. They tore the house apart for a while, looking behind books and inside lampshades and drawers for microphones…



(*Direct*) In hindsight, I wonder where they learned to look for bugs. Did they learn the lampshade thing from Bluey? Sesame Street?



They would learn that from Spongebob. That show is so weird. 



(*Aside*) Anyway, they tore the house apart. We had to really get on them about putting the house back together, and now they keep smiling in random directions whenever they’re being good. It’s like they think they’re in The Office. We’ve been cracking up about it; it’s so cute. You’ll have to come by before the big day and see them. 



Sure, you can come over tomorrow; you’re always welcome. Is everything okay?



\[You laugh.\]



You can totally- 



(*Direct*) Baby, do you have another roll of tape over there? This one’s out.



Thank you. 



(*Aside*) What was I saying? Right, you can absolutely hide Mom’s present at our house. Is she tearing your house apart trying to find it? 



She never changes. I’m trying my damnedest to make sure she doesn’t pass that bad habit onto the kids. Why don’t you two come over tomorrow and come to the mall with us? We’re taking the kids to get pictures with Santa. We can distract Mom with helping the kids get ready, and you can take her present out the trunk and hide it somewhere in the house. Sound like a plan?



Amazing; come—



(*Direct*) Need another hand for that, hon? 



You want me to hold it here? 



Of course, you’re welcome; that present looks great



 *(Aside*) —Anyway, come by around 9:30, 10, and come hungry. We’re gonna get brunch before, make a whole special occasion out of it. 



Obviously, we’re not taking them to eat in their picture clothes; we’re having them change into them at the mall. I’m a new parent, but I’m not *that* new; I learned something our first time around with Lindy. 



\[You laugh.\] Good. Alright, Dad, I’ll see you two early tomorrow. I love you. 



\[We hear an optional beep as you hang up the phone.\]



(*Direct*) How much do you want to bet my Mom’s already found her present and figured out how she should react properly surprised when she opens it Christmas morning?



Funnily enough, he also got her a Le Creuset, says she’s been getting more into cooking as a hobby. If she likes it, we should get him to the sample sales with me… for me, maybe! 



The fun in that would be remaining unbruised and unharmed, but I see your point… Oh god, and we still have so many presents to go! Why didn’t we get everyone we love and cherish gift cards again? 



I think the next best thing to cold hard cash is a perfectly valid way to show people you love them, but agree to disagree. You know what we can both agree to though?



\[There’s a rustling as you get up.\] 



A little wine to get the work done and this party started. You thinking red or white? 



\[You give the listener a kiss, and there’s footsteps as you start to walk away.\]



You got it, babe. I’ll be right back; don’t have too much fun without me\~!



\[You laugh, and we fade to black.\]

My brother and I do a monthly coffee hangout, and last weekend was when we did it this month. We talked about this sub and me wanting to be more involved, as well as politics in general. After using him as a sounding board, I decided that the most direct way for me to make an impact would be running for public office. I had tried to get people to write me in on the ballot earlier this year, but I knew it wouldn't do much.

So, after doing a fair bit of research, I've decided to get put on the primary ballot for state representative for my district here in PA! Looking at prior primaries, there's generally only one person on the Democratic ballot, so there's a good chance I'll make it to the 2026 general election. We are a pretty red district, but in the general elections we tend to skew 55% Republican and 45% Democrat. I have no idea how this will play out, but there's only one way to find out.

1p1kolw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1p1kolw/i_like_my_boss_but_she_cant_keep_up_with_her/,"I like my boss, but she can't keep up with her workload...","Hello,

I (25 F) am seeking some general advice on how to navigate working for my director (60ish F) that can't keep up with her work. 

We are a very small team (just us two) and it feels so embarrassing when she constantly makes mistakes, forgets to follow through on tasks/customer inquiries, and complains to coworkers. It also is hard to fix her mistakes last minute or have to keep reminding her to complete tasks. 

How do I get her to work more efficiently?! Is it even my responsibility to  micro-manage her work? Am I a huge bitch?!

Why she cannot keep up with work:

* Exhibit 1: My director is a very very nice lady--almost too nice. She cannot say no to anyone, and constantly adds unnecessary tasks to her/my plate to please someone else. This includes:

> having customers GO TO HER HOME sometimes to drop off paperwork,
> bringing in a HUGE coffee order (calling me to come help her bring the coffee in and deliver them to everyone),
> volunteering to run/bring in many items (bought with her personal money) for some of the many stupid office parties the agency holds, 
> or volunteering to take on a task that isn't relevant to our department/content area. 

She already has so much on her plate and I have had to remind her to prioritize her load, and that it's okay to say no. 

* Exhibit 2: She talks and complains A LOT. This takes up a lot of her time. This includes:

> A customer phone call that would normally take 5-20 minutes sometimes takes upwards of an hour if she knows the person because she shoots the shit, and just talks and talks and talks about personal stuff. The same goes for one on one meetings with coworkers. A 30 minute meeting magically turns into 1.5 - 2 hours. 
> I will be focusing on work and she will come by and just complain about everything and nothing all at the same time--the commute was too long, her husband didn't do the dishes, her boss (who's office is very close to us) is micro-managing, etc. I have had to politely tell her MANY times that I have a lot to finish, or that we have a tight agenda to work through if we are in a meeting. I try to mentally allot time in my day to chat with her because it is unavoidable at this point to simply do my work in peace. I often can't get a word in and have to just nod and say one of these phrases: ""ah. mmhm. Ohhh. I see."" Though we do sometimes have good conversation when i'm feeling bold and able to speak up. 

* Exhibit 3: She makes a lot of mistakes that she then wastes lots of time fixing, and writing emails to clear up the situation/error. This includes:

> typos, 
> forgetting to complete a step in a task (which i usually have to fix),
> forgetting to look into the entire context of the situation, so she says the wrong thing and has to back track to fix what she just said,
> forgetting she has a meeting until I remind her.

* Exhibit 4: Organization skills are lacking. This includes:

> I have to remind her to check our planner to see all the tasks assigned to her.
> I have to go through her email often and flag emails that require her attention. It takes her a while to get to them because she is talking about personal shit, bitching about work, or dragging out a situation to someone for an hour, or drowning in the huge workload on her plate. 
> I will go through her email and delegate by sending myself inquiries that I am able to answer. 
> I regularly go through and track her voicemails, return the voicemails I am able to, or log the ones she needs to answer in our planner. 
> Her email inbox and folders are lacking serious organization. She always has 100+ unread emails in her inbox, and they all just stay in her main inbox. There are no sub folders. I want to organize it so bad but I know she will get even more confused on where everything is.
> Her office is a mess. 
> Because she is so behind she will constantly take her work home, which is probably why she is so burnt out. I have told her it would be easier to make the most of her 8 hour work day (but she clearly doesn't).

Reading through all this, I feel like a judgemental bitch. She is a very nice, caring, and knowledgeable lady. I love her as a person. She just has so much going on. I just want her to focus during her 8 hours and get some actual work done! My therapist has said it's not my responsibility to do her job... but I want to hear what you guys think. 

TLDR: My boss is a people pleaser, talks too much, procrastinates, and lacks the organization skills to keep up with her workload, and it affects my job.",1,1763588253.0,WorkAdvice,2,1.0,False

so this time, i havent been checking on my exes stuff rlly but one of my friends told me for his bday, he posted a pic of emily. so he left her for me, then the second we break up, literally within 2 months of us oficially ending our 5 years of being entangled, hes POSTING another girl, publicly claiming her. shocker, it didnt last and they broke up recently. i know this because he just sent me a spotify request of a song by OFFSET for crying out loud. im upset. hes trying to interfere with my healing. part of me still misses him and i dont know why when he might as well have ran me over w his car. it bothers me that love is so invaluable to him, that he can switch his emotions every day. its like it was never real between us. you love me one day, you love her the next day, how is it so unsustainable? whats my problem ugh.",1,1763588092.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

What I Learned About Stomach Balance For both men & women,"Acid reflux and heartburn have become super common in the US because of stress, late eating, processed foods, and long sitting hours. I used to think it was just “extra acidity,” but it’s more about how the stomach and gut handle food.

Here’s what I learned while trying to understand my own reflux episodes:

1. Eating late at night is the biggest trigger

When you lie down with a full stomach, acid comes upward.
Eating 2–3 hours before bed reduces reflux significantly.

2. Heavy meals slow digestion

Large, oily meals stay in the stomach longer → more acid → more burning.
Smaller, lighter meals help reduce symptoms.

3. Stress directly increases stomach acid

Stress can tighten digestive muscles and increase acid production.
Even 10 minutes of deep breathing helps.


4. Coffee on an empty stomach makes reflux worse

Most Americans drink morning coffee first thing.
But acidic drinks on an empty stomach can trigger burning.


5. Poor gut balance = more acidity

Gas, bloating, constipation — all worsen acid flow.

When digestion improves, reflux reduces naturally.


6. Lying flat after eating is a mistake

Gravity helps keep acid down.
Just staying upright 30–45 minutes after a meal can prevent burning.

Conclusion

Acid reflux isn’t just about “too much acid” — it’s about routine, stress, sleep, gut balance, and meal timing.

I'm a serial entrepreneur and long-time finance executive. I've led companies that produce everything from enterprise software to carbon capture technology to pet wearables.

Today, I'm involved in a stealth project that's very personal for me. That's because it's dedicated to helping adults with ADHD.

My son was diagnosed with ADHD in the 5th grade. Like many moms, as a result of having my child examined, I too was diagnosed with ADD. When I asked if I should consider treatment, my doctor's guidance was to drink coffee, which I’ve been doing since I was 10 (another story). She explained that I’ve been self-treating with caffeine and should continue on that road. Back then I thought ""Coffee? Really? This is the best solution we have for attention disorder?""

In the years since, I've tried many coping tools that address ADHD by helping with daily planning (remember Franklin planners?), scheduling, reminders, etc. In my professional life, I've relied heavily on organizational and executive functioning skills learned over the years, to maintain focus and manage my attention.

The project I'm involved in promises to be the first real solution that addresses the underlying causes of ADHD, actually helping users become aware of their attention and teaching them how to manage it. We saw amazing results in clinical trials last year at UCLA and UC Berkeley. We just completed our final beta trials on the software app and are nearing our release in the app stores.

I look forward to sharing more about this project, and interacting with many of you around our shared struggles with ADHD and ADD.

And you need a fricking sea to take down Hanlan ""Fox"" Lith! That's right. Me, the best Golden!

...wait, no. The best Copper. That's better. Some silvers can start a fire just by breathing.

In conclusion, the party was a banger. Everyone who attended was shitfaced. That's why Otto didn't scream at us for being an hour late for the roll call.

\[I have to admit... it was a good party\] Otto's voice was weak and raspy. No shouts, cause he would give himself a headache, \[Raise your hand if you're alive. Jordan... Ethan... Remy... Western... Luke... Farlander...\]

Moans and grunts were the only replies. To be honest, I could barely move in this hot sun.

\[Hanlan...\]

\[Urgh...\]

\[Ray...\]

No hand raised.

\[Ray? Ray?!\]

Still no answer. I looked around and there was no snowball. Only brown, scruffy hairballs.

\[Where the fuck is Ray?!\] He shouted and quickly stopped. The ringing in our heads could split our skulls in half.

\[Goat's still sleeping in the barracks. Drank a lot... like... a LOT lot\]

\[To be fair, we did help him...\] Wizard added. Hell yeah, we did. Even when my memory is foggy, I still remember most of this massive celebration...

======

\[Woooooo! PARTEEEEEEH!!!\]

\[I'm going to throw up... again...\]

\[All hail the Basitin mom!\]

Even at 2 o'clock, the party kept going strong. The garden was spacious enough for the unit of elite soldiers to have a night of debauchery. Those who didn't drink, smoked weed

I know what you're thinking, *'The best soldiers in the country, c*rème de la crème, acting like Keidrans teenagers? It's the most obvious breaking of the law!*'*

Here's my answer - Yes, but also no.

Upon creating the Royal Guard all those centuries ago, the King made a special edict called the Golden Privileges - a set of rules we're allowed to ignore due to our position. Maybe it's hypocritical but I don't see anyone complaining.

On the top of the list was alcohol. Each one of us could brew it on a small scale. That's why so many of us have a brewery business in the countryside. The second was the immunity from noise complaints.

We tried to get the exclusion from the reproduction week but the only way to actually do it is to have sex with the King.

Anyway, we're happy with what we have. Some folks got on an improv stage and started playing on the instruments. Even when tipsy, they were better than any army composer.

Me and Wizard left the courtyard and get on the wall to see if someone's gonna fuck something up.

We were close enough to hear the bullshit but far enough to not get hit by it.

One group of Coppers finally slowed down on drinking. We called them Philosophers cause after drinking one bottle, they will have an existential crisis. And everything they said was something completely unexpected.

Western, Farlander and Ethan sat down on the table near the wall, too drunk to get up. Remy was lying in the grass, with two blunts in his mouth.

Finally, Western spoke, \[I'll tell you... Peacetime is a good time to be a Golden!\]

\[Exactly\] Farlander added, \[How's your life then?\]

The first wiseman got serious, \[It's not good... but it ain't bad. You could say it's average\]

Ethan, the only Silver joined, \[Then it's fine. Am I right, Remy?\]

Remy got up from the ground and took his blunts out of his mouth, \[You ask if it's fine... One man was born with an average manhood, the second... with a huge one. Fucking beast! Now... which boy is happier?\]

You thought about it? Good, here's the answer.

\[None\] Remy answered, \[One doesn't have legs, the other have seizures\] He finally crawled onto the table, \[You ask me if it's fine... Fucking course it is, bottoms up!\]

And how can you not agree to his thesis...?

Right after emptying his mugs, they returned to find more life-changing questions.

But it wasn't the whole squad. Two more individuals - Jordan and Luke. Jordan was the main thinker. But recently, he went into the sidelines. What happened?

\[I loved her...\] he was sobbing in the corner, \[I will be single forever...\]

Ah, the broken heart... The thing that will never be mend.... That's why I'm not into romantic crap. Finding the special loved one isn't as easy as you think. Just a simple sex here and there, that's enough,

Luckily for him, Luke was his moral support, \[At least you scored... I'm still a fucking virgin...\] he sounded like a sad drunk but he haven't touched a bottle, even during the initiation.

\[Oh yeah, I'm so happy right now... I have a deep dark hole inside but I still have the time with my ex...\]

\[Shut the FUCK up...\] Luke wanted to shove his comrade but instead he just rest his head on his shoulder, \[I need a fffffuck... At this point I will fuck anyone...\]

\[What are you, gay?\]

\[Maybe...\] he burked.

Jordan sighed and hugged his friend, \[That's alright, man. Take your time...\]

Then, I came up with an idea. I looked at Wizard. He thought the same. Let's do a little pranking.

We have the victims but we need a third party. Someone who he won't recognize.

We chose the closest one - Rylut. Him and I are often drinking in the bars in Keidran districts. I never understood why he was into dragons. He had a better chance of pulling up the King than a thousand-year-old flying lizard. Nonetheless, we are pals.

I went to him and told him what to do. Rylut agreed with a devilish smile. Wizard prepared a special flask weeks ago for that opportunity.

Rylut approached Ray who tried to climb on a tree. The branches and tree bark were too weak to hold him. I can bet he woke up on some rock shelf more than few times.

But anyway, Ray drank the offered flask and almost dropped dead. All that talk about having a head for liquor shattered like a bottle of cheap wine.

Wizard and Rylut dragged him out of the party while I snuck into the laundry. Luckily for me, the laundry was done. I took the most frilly clothes that didn't break the dress code. It was a white dress and exotic ankle covers.

We dressed him up like a bride who was about to pass out and showed the rest. The company burst with laughter.

Everyone had their own idea of what to do with her- er, him. Few wanted to dance with him, others wanted to pour even more into him to see what will happen...

But Luke was the best of them all. He just walked to Ray and hugged him, face into the decolletage filled with socks! Both of them were holding each other from falling.

All of this, all that booze, it was too much. I couldn't bear the insanity of what was going on. I rolled in the ground, drunk and high, while Luke vanished with his bride...

======

\[...fuck you, guys...\] Luke muttered, completely embarrassed by his inebriated actions. Those who didn't laughed, grinned like idiots, \[At least he was soft...\]

Otter was still in pain from his own shout, \[Get him here, right now. I don't care how, just do it...\]

I volunteered. Only because the barracks are much darker. Luke, Wizard and Rylut joined me in case we will need to move Goat's corpse.

We suspect that cause that showman didn't move the slightest!

\[Oi! Get the fuck up\] I nudged him. He replied with a grunt.

I knew how painful the hangover can be, yet orders are orders, \[Sigh... don't tell me I didn't warn you. Boys...\]

We all grabbed the sheets and his limbs and began to pull. But as the sheets were removed and the bastard landed on the floor, we realized one thing.

It wasn't Raynard. It was an arctic she-wolf in a bride's dress! With a fucking pineapple!

\[Ngh...\] the Keidran with a huge cleavage grunted, \[Fuck off, it ain't my working hours...\]

All of us were at a lack of words. The lady wore the same clothes we put Goat into!

\[Uhh...\] Wizard finally managed to say something, \[Ray...?\]

\[Huh?\] The wolf reacted. Fuuuuuck... did we just turned Ray into a lady?! Was he always a girl?!

She wiped her eyes and blinked, \[You're not Ray-Ray\]

\[Yeah, so are you...\] I mumbled,

\[Does that mean...\] Luke gasped and threw his arms into air, \[I fucked a girl! Woo! Take that, Fox!\]

The Keidran was a definition of the hourglass, taller than all of us with a perfect height ratio for hugs. In other words, I was jealous.

\[Where's Ray?\] the pretty girl stretched up, lifting her tail. That image burned in my mind.

I stopped drooling for a moment, \[We, uhh... were hoping to find him here. Either that or he changed into a woman\]

\[Hold up a sec!\] Wizard cut in, dropping his noble vocabulary, \[How the fuck did you even get here?!\]

\[Oh, that? Ray-Ray helped me\] she answered with an innocent smile. In my head was forming an image of a corrupted angel vixen.

Wizard was even more flabergasted, \[That's just leave even more question!\]

Luckily for us, the wolf who turns to have a beautifull name Michelle, told us what happened...

======

After cuddling with Luke like after finishing writing the form 1132-B, Goat decided that's too boring and the night still young. Somehow, he managed to leave the castle in white as pigeon's shit dress without anyone noticing.

Even bigger somehow, our bride managed to find a bar in the Keidran district!

It was some tavern at the harbor called 'Happy Siren'. That's why I didn't recognise that woman. The owner didn't hire vixens.

Goat just barged into as if he was the owner, walked to the snep bartender and bought a round for everyone. The confusion and class rivalry changed into cheer and acceptance. Alcohol can do wonders!

After a while, Michelle sat next to him, hoping she would get more money out of him, <So... looks like you had a great party>

<You bet!> Ray laughed and started drinking again,

She looked up and down and asked, <Who got married?>

<I have no idea!>

They talked for a while. In her words, he chokes his sadness with laughs and booze. Anything to make him forget something and it wasn't him in a wedding dress.

Then, someone slapped her butt, <C'mon, slut! I'm feeling frisky tonight!>

It was her job but the rudeness and lack of respect toward the lady was too much, <Fuck off and come back when you learn some manners!>

<Hey, I fucking paid for a good time and->

Ray cut him off, <You heard the lady. Get out before I make you>

The rude customer burst with laughter, <Like I'm scared of you, dipshit! What, did your mommy buy you this pretty dress\~?>

Momma's boy put down his drink and got up. He was still wobbly due to all the booze in him but he didn't fall.

<What you gonna do? Come on, hit m-> THUNK!

Ray just headbutted him! The guy got KO'd in one blow.

<Thank you handsome\~> Michelle's tail embraced his tail. She expected him to froze but instead, he leaned to her.

<Hey...> The drunk Basitin said, <That jerk said he paid already...>

<Mmhmm...> She put her paw on his white cheek, <Are you thinking about something specific, honey\~?>

<I do... but...> He went silent for a while, <It's getting late and I have to get back to the castle...>

This was something that made her quiet, <You- You're the Golden?!>

<Yeah... hic! Joined half a year ago... Don't even know why...>

<I doubt that they will let us in, darling...>

Ray finished his drink and said with a weird smug, <Don't worry... I know a shortcut>

======

\[And he climbed on the wall with me on his back!\] the busty women laughed, curing his alcohol with some leftover booze from the party.

\[Lucky son of a bitch...\] I said. Wolves aren't my thing but damn! Bitch got the curves! \[And the pineapple?\]

\[What pineapple?\] The lady asked confused,

\[The one next to you? Why is it here?\]

The wolf shrugged, \[I dunno. Maybe he was hungry?\]

\[Wait a minute...\] Luke spoke, \[I was on the same bed! How the hell you didn't wake me up while doing sex?!\]

\[Cause we didn't. We just cuddle... He was so soft, I just couldn't refuse...\]

\[I know, right?\] Luke replied but then, he stopped smiling, \[Wait a minute... He climbed several meters long walls... and he didn't climb you?!\]

\[Sounds like a challenge... hope you didn't spend all your paycheck, yet\~\] She grabbed Luke's chin, causing his tail to launch up, \[Just two of us, in a comfy, warm bed\~\]

\[Maybe after we find our lovely bride\] Wizard stopped them from having rather expensive fun, \[Otto will execute us if we won't find him. Hell, he will murder Goat if he finds about Michelle!\]

\[Okay, okay!\] Luke got out from his trance, \[Do you know where Raynard is?\]

The she-wolf thought for a while and then sighed, \[I'm sorry but I didn't even notice he was gone\]

Oh crap, we're so dead... \[M-Maybe someone saw him wandering around the castle...?\] I suggested,

\[Almost everyone was in the garden partying. And even if they noticed him, they would report him already!\]

Hmm... someone who was in the castle and doesn't have a stick up their arse... \[Alaric!\]

\[You two go\] Luke said, \[I will take care of Michelle\]

\[I swear if you're gonna-\] Wizard didn't finish. I grabbed him and ran from the barrack.

\[No time! Let's go!\]

When we reached the Master General's Office, I banged the door. Come to think about it, I'm lucky I didn't destroy it.

The general opened the door. Judging by his eye bags, not only us didn't slept that night, \[What's the problem?\] he asked, tired yet firmly.

I took a deep breath, \[Sir, I know this will sound crazy but... did you see anyone yesterday's night, naked or in a wedding dress?\]

Even the general have to process what I've just said, \[Nnnno... but I saw Ray half-naked. Does that count?\]

\[Oh, thanks the King...\] I sighed with relief, \[Do you know where he is, sir?\]

\[Yes, I do\] he looked... annoyed, \[As much as I approve your... celebrations... you don't know where to stop\]

Wizard grinned nervously, completely embarrassed. Meanwhile, I was proud of that. No brakes on this bad boy! \[So... where he is?\]

\[In the closet\] the general sipped his coffee,

I looked at Wizard, he looked at me, and I looked at Alaric, \[Yeah... doubt that... he's bi at most\]

\[Nononono! He is literally in my closet\]

Somehow, that was even more ridiculous than looking for a guy in a bride's outfit. Fuck it, let's go to this crazy story...

======

The Master General was pulling an all-nighter again. I don't know why he's working himself to the bone. He's got to the top, right after the King!

Back to the story. Some time after the midnight, he heard a crash. When he went to check what had happened, he found Goat. Half-naked, on the ground and completely wasted.

\[Gud myrning, sir...\] the white-furred soldier saluted worse than a two-day conscript.

\[It's middle of the night...\] even someone as great as general would need time for Goat's bullshit, \[And what are you doing here?\]

\[Oh... nuffing muchhhh...\] he managed to blurt, \[Jussssst goin' to 'Er Majessti...\]

Everyone would figure out the outcome - an embarrassment at best, execution at worst. Being the only general with empathy, he tried to discourage him, \[I don't think that's a good idea, soldier...\]

\[Bah! Eferyones shtill awake!\] Ray held the wall but it was very slippery,

Realizing that he talked to the stubborn drunk, the kind that he will punch his way through the mountain than go around it, \[Ok, but at least be presentable\]

\[I AM PREVENTABLE!\] Ex-bride shouted, \[Pre...dictable? Preparable... Pregnable...?\]

General was losing his patience, \[Your clothes! Where are your clothes?!\]

\[I dunno...\] oh my King, he was so pathetic, \[Can I bollow yous...?\]

The booze stench finally hit him, \[F... Fine... and you need to wash your teeth\]

\[Righ, righ... I neet to be peetty... to azk 'er...\] Ray stopped holding the wall and grabbed the general.

\[Ask her what?\]

\[Nut ur businessess...\]

They move to Alaric's office. Then, the general threw him into the closet and locked it down, \[Sorry, Ray. But I need you to sober up!\]

Few grunts and banging were heard but quickly stopped. He finally went to sleep.

======

\[He was surprisingly soft...\] Alaric smiled, \[Like a giant pillow\]

\[But what about the pineapple?\] I asked,

\[What pineapple?\]

My hands were shaking, \[The pine- you know what? I'm done. Let's just get that drunk bastard before Otto will rip our legs from ass\]

The general unlocked the closet and... no Basitin inside.

\[Welp...\] Wizard broke the anxious silence, \[At least we know he isn't gay...\]

\[Wizard... shut up\]

\[Understandable...\]

\[Hmm... there're few planks loose...\] Master General reach forward...

And there was a secret tunnel behind the closet! \[...we will never find him, are we...?\]

I'm on a hangover, my body is still churning the liters of alcohol and weed and I'm still trying to find that fucking goat asshole!

And then, Alaric turned to us and said, \[Which one of you is gonna crawl?\]

I swear, Wizard cheats in rock, paper, scissors! He always wins!

\[When I said I wanted to explore some holes, I didn't mean that, you know?\]

\[Shut up and get your arse there\] Wizard gave me a moral support.

So I crawl like in a trench war in a dark, tight tunnel. Luckily, Ray cleaned most of the dust with his body so It wasn't that bad.

The tunnel turned sharply and went down. When I reach the end, I found myself in the winery!

It was dark but fortunately, someone left the lantern. I lit it up and...

I found him. But the state I found him...

He was awake. Wearing only pants, NO ankle wraps...

Embraced by Her Majesty who was snoring louder than the dragon's roar.

\[I have so many questions...\] my brain produced so many inappropriate images...

*\[Help me!\]* he whispered,

*\[Brother, you're where millions wished to be. How did it even happen?!\]*

*\[W-Well... The King needed a bit of wine to help her fall asleep... and that's when I crawled out...\]*

*\[And how did you crawl into her arms?\]*

He went silent, *\[I... don't remember...\]*

*\[Yeah, right. And I'm the King of Human Empire\]*

*\[Fine! I asked her if I can take a sip too!\]* he blushes like a tomato,

*\[Just a sip, huh?\]* I chuckled,

*\[S-Shut up...\]*

This shit was a miraculous cure for my hangover, *\[Alright, give me a hand\]*

*\[Nononono- Hrnk!\]*

When I tried to pull him out, Her Majesty hold him tighter. MUCH tighter, *\[Mmm... Lucas...\]* she muttered, still deeply asleep.

Raynard paled even more than usually, *\[H-How did she- ngh... n-nervermind... please, help me!\]* he whined, visibly in pain of being crushed.

The worthy death by snu snu seems interesting but... I think I'm too young for that, *\[Maybe, I just go and tell Otto you're busy...?\]*

\[No!\] he protested, *\[Get back here!\]*

*\[Have fun!\]*

*\[Hanlan, I swear too-\]* and I was gone. I swear to say only good things about him in while they will bury him.

======

That was a crazy day. Definitely in my top 3. I fear I can't legally tell about my initiation. They would censor it, exile me and lobotomize you.

We never discovered the mystery of the pineapple. We sliced it up and ate. It was a good pineapple.

Don't worry about Ray. Guy's fine, just a bit of bruises and a headache. Man got too close to the sun... Not that I wouldn't do the same.

Otto didn't kill us for the failed mission. A combination of really bad hangover and our claims that Her Majesty is giving him a proper punishment. I told the boys the actual stories. They were laughing for hours...

I can see why Adelaide picked the Goat. There's no dull moment with this snowball...",4,1763587752.0,Twokinds,1,1.0,False
1p1kfz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p1kfz1/how_to_be_an_alpha_without_being_a_loud_asshole/,How to be an ALPHA (without being a loud asshole): the real guide that actually works,"So many guys out here think being alpha is about dominating others, flexing online, chasing girls, or walking like a WWE character. Let’s be honest, this fake “alpha energy” is everywhere on TikTok and IG. The loudest ones usually have zero clue what power looks like. It’s performative. It’s cringe. It’s insecurity in disguise.

If you peel back what real strength looks like, mentally, emotionally, socially, it’s quiet. It’s disciplined. It’s earned. After deep-diving into books, psychology research, and military leadership training models, here’s what actually builds that inner “alpha state.” This isn’t about being better than others. It’s about being better than who you were yesterday.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to becoming that calm, unshakable, self-respecting version of yourself. Aka, the real alpha.

---

**Step 1: Redefine ""alpha"" (stop chasing social dominance)**

The real alpha doesn’t seek power over people. They cultivate power *within* themselves. Research from Stanford psychologist Dr. Deborah Gruenfeld shows that high-status individuals aren’t aggressive, they’re calm, measured, and unfazed. Dominance isn’t about taking space. It’s about emotional gravity.

Psychologist Robert Sapolsky, after studying primates for 30 years, found that the healthiest leaders in animal packs were *not* the most aggressive. They were the ones that protected the group, made fair decisions, and managed stress well. Same goes for humans.

Real alpha energy = secure attachment, not loud performance.

---

**Step 2: Learn emotional restraint (masculine calm > reactive rage)**

That guy who flips out over a late coffee order? Not alpha. That’s toddler behavior with muscles.

A 2018 meta-analysis in *Personality and Social Psychology Review* found that emotional regulation is one of the strongest predictors of leadership capacity. Alpha energy means being unfazed under stress, not exploding under pressure.

Try these:

- Pause before reacting: Count 1–2–3 when you feel triggered.
- Practice “name it to tame it”: Label your emotion to reduce its power.
- Journal your daily emotional patterns. Clarity = control.

---

**Step 3: Build a body you respect (not just one others admire)**

It’s not about abs. It’s about discipline. The gym is where you build credibility *with yourself*.

Strength training increases not just testosterone but also self-trust and mental resilience. Studies from the University of Michigan show that men who consistently strength train report increased confidence and lower anxiety, *regardless* of aesthetics.

Try this:

- Stick to 3x/week resistance training.
- Fuel for focus, not dopamine: no dirty bulks, no crash diets.
- Track consistency, not image.

---

**Step 4: Enforce boundaries like a leader**

Weak men avoid hard conversations. Real leaders don't.

One of the strongest alpha traits? Knowing how to say “no” cleanly. According to Dr. Henry Cloud’s work in *Boundaries*, the ability to assert your limits without apology is one of the most attractive and powerful behaviors. It signals self-respect.

Try this:

- Practice saying “That doesn’t work for me.” Stop over-explaining.
- If someone crosses a line, call it out early. Don’t wait for buildup.
- Drop the need to please. Alpha men aren’t approval junkies.

---

**Step 5: Go deep, not wide (real alpha = intentional presence)**

Being alpha isn’t about how many people you impress. It’s about how deeply you impact the right ones.

Dr. Cal Newport’s *Deep Work* framework applies beyond productivity. It’s about becoming someone who creates value through sustained focus. Social alpha behavior is the same: less small talk, more real connection.

Try this:

- Study people. Observe more than you speak.
- In convos, anchor eye contact, speak slower, ask better questions.
- Drop the “look at me” energy. Alpha isn’t performative.

---

**Step 6: Read like your life depends on it**

The smartest men I’ve met read. Period. And no, it’s not just finance bros burning through 10 books a week trying to get rich. It’s guys who actually want to understand the human condition.

Here are 3 ridiculously good books to help you level up your inner strength:

1. **""The Way of the Superior Man"" by David Deida**  
   This one's a modern classic. A mix of masculine/feminine dynamics, purpose-finding, and emotional mastery. If you’ve ever felt aimless or too reactive in relationships, this book will shake you. It’s intense. It’s weird at moments. But it’s deep. After reading it, I started seeing masculinity less as dominance and more as grounded energy. This book changes how you show up.

2. **""Iron John"" by Robert Bly**  
   A cult favorite for a reason. Bly explores ancient myths and links them to modern manhood. It pushes you to explore the “wild man” archetype, deep, mature masculinity most men have buried under performance and approval-seeking. Hands down one of the most profound books on male identity.

3. **""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" by Dr. Robert Glover**  
   Sounds gimmicky, but it’s *scary accurate*. This book exposes how people-pleasing and emotional repression wreck men’s confidence. It’s a punch to the ego, but in a good way. If you’ve ever felt resentment or hidden anger, this explains *why* and what to do.

---

**Step 7: Upgrade your learning tools daily**

Forming a daily learning habit is one of the most alpha things you can do. Read. Question. Reflect. Keep a curious brain and a stable emotional core.

Apps that help:

- **Insight Timer**: Best for mindfulness audio, guided breathing, and emotional regulation.
- **BeFreed**: A personalized learning app built by a team from Columbia University and ex-Google, Pinterest folks. It takes knowledge from books, research and thought leaders and turns it into low-effort, highly addictive podcasts. You can chat with it, pick your host’s voice, and choose how deep you wanna study, 10, 20, or 40 mins. It even builds a personalized study roadmap based on your goals, using your listening history. I love asking its avatar Freedia for book recs or debating ideas in real time. My favorite part? It journals your takeaways, gives AI-powered flashcards, and helps you *internalize* what you learn. Their masculinity, confidence, and leadership library is top-tier. And yes, it covers every book I mentioned above. Perfect if you're trying to improve just 1% daily.

---

**Step 8: Hold a vision, not just a vibe**

The most alpha trait? Men who know where they’re headed, even if they’re not there yet.

Have a 5-year mission. Start building it. Even if it’s quiet, even if no one sees it yet. The real power comes when you don’t need to signal status. You carry it in how you walk, how you speak, how you work.

If you’re working on yourself daily, you’re already alpha. No one needs to validate it.

So yeah. Be strong. But be wise. Be fierce. But be kind. That’s real alpha.

And now, with such an expansive body of work, it’s become easier to note how the group’s first three efforts differ from the most recent three and why in my personal opinion, the first three are a trifecta of perfection in terms of scope and grandeur, not surpassed by the latter three.

I’ve spent time sitting with these records and wondering why there seems to have been such a noticeable shift in the band’s efforts (I say band as opposed to singling out the songwriting of frontwoman Florence Welch, because some of these factors go beyond her lyricism). With that being said, nothing here is presented in absolutes: there will be things I critique and praise present across all albums and or things I critique that may have begun on FATM 1-3, but crystalised on 4-6, or you may believe that the divide is better analysed from 1-2, 2-3, 4-6. Discussion and debate is welcomed!

Across all six albums, Welch is inspired by and references art (What the Water Gave Me by Frida Kahlo would inspire a song of the same name), religion (“The only God that I know and it does not want me on my knees to believe”), mythology (“Midas is king and he holds me so tight”) and literature (Seven Devils was inspired by a line in Chester Hime’s ‘If He Hollers Let Him Go’. On FATM 1-3, all the songs employ the above, but the songs are written ‘about’. About a breakup, about being on the precipice of fame, about wanting to be turned into a big tall tree. On FATM 4-6, there are songs written about, but now there are songs written ‘to’, where the listener or the subject of Flo’s contrition or heartache is addressed in a direct, unflinching manner.

This of course reflects maturity in Welch’s abilities as a songwriter. In a 2018 interview with The Current, she acknowledges this: “I think I used metaphor a lot in earlier work to hide what it was that I was actually trying to say. If I could dress up the pain or the guilt or the shame in these sort of cathedral-esque — like dress up the mess. Then when you're further away from the things you're ashamed of, and you've maybe come to a better place with them, it's really much more easy to be truthful in your music because you're not trying to hide. You're like, this is what it is. This is kind of what went down and it takes you into a different form of songwriting, I think.”

The terms ‘diaristic’ and ‘confessional’ as it relates to songwriting have come to prominence in recent years, thanks to Taylor Swift, considered one of the greatest songwriters of her generation. FATM 4-6 take on similar leanings, as the metaphors have been replaced by searing, plainly spoken confessions or lyrics that read as if they could be spoken to a friend during a coffee shop catch-up. The effect of this is that we see Welch become vulnerable in a way she never was before. This is used to devastating effect on Everybody Scream, which largely relates to the ectopic pregnancy she suffered in 2023 and her subsequent healing journey. In 2012’s All This and Heaven Too, Welch struggles to describe the feeling of being in love; “And the heart is hard to translate, it has a language of its own. It talks in tongues and quiet sighs”. Forward to 2018’s No Choir, she remarks “It's hard to write about being happy 'cause the older I get I find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject…no chorus could come in about two people sitting doing nothing”.

I sat on this essay for a while before posting and in this time, I realised that alongside the diaristic and the confessional, there was a third factor not present on the latter three albums, that has marked a profound shift in Welch’s songwriting: it’s observational. And, these observations draw upon the mundanities of life. To me, FATM 1-3 felt like Welch was using songwriting as therapy. However, the observational aspects of FATM 4-6 now make the songs feel like therapy sessions. “I drink too much coffee and think of you often” / “And left me doin' laundry to think on what I'd done” / “And on the way to couples therapy, you put your headphones in so you didn't have to talk to me”.

Of course, the religious, artistic, literary and mythological references are still present on Welch's later work, but now they sit alongside the technological and the modern, which somewhat disrupts and breaks immersion. “And Joshua came down from the mountain with a tablet in his hands. Told me that he loved me, yeah and then ghosted me again”. There are some songs such as Perfume and Milk where the mundane and modern work in the context of the song brilliantly: “Downloading ""Revelations of Divine Love"" on my phone. Trying to read, but getting distracted. Trying to live, but feeling so damaged”. Here, the tragedy of grief is depicted in a haunting couplet. But, contrast this to “And it's your troublеd hero back for season six. When it's at its darkеst, it's my favourite bit”, from The Old Religion - a track that invokes something primal and paganistic, but shoehorns in a cringy, self-referential double entendre relating to Buffy and the band’s sixth album.

Water is another constant motif across all six albums, representing giving in to the vastness of the ocean or using the metaphor of a sinking ship to describe self-destruction, but lately. We’ve seen the emergence of a new motif, the phone - representing anxiety and un-mindfulness. To be fair, this did start on ‘Delilah’ from the band’s third record, where Welch describes the anxiety of waiting for her lover to reach out. I consider this one of their best songs and Welch’s best exercise in weaving a religious reference into her songwriting, across an extended metaphor. The phone reference itself doesn’t go beyond “holding on for your call”, as the focus is primarily on using the biblical tale of Samson and Delilah to draw a parallel to a strained relationship, but compare this to 2025’s much more literal Buckle “I wanna call you on the telephone…A crowd of thousands came to see me, and you couldn't reply for three days”.

I realise this may come across as overly critical, so I’ll offer a counterpoint - but one that still highlights the chasm between FATM 1-3 and 4-6. Another new, prominent theme across FATM 4-6 is Flo’s relationship to performance, specifically performance as salvation or healing. Again, this began on FATM 3 with Pure Feeling. Here, Flo again uses metaphor to describe performance as a ‘pure feeling’, in which she’s invisible and magical, but doesn’t offer much more beyond these lines to explain what performance means to her. Contrast this to FATM 6’s title track and One of the Greats, where Welch is able to pinpoint with surgical accuracy her relationship to performance: “I was only beautiful under the lights, only powerful there”. “Here, I don't have to be quiet. Here, I don't have to be kind, extraordinary and normal all at the same time”.

Sobriety’s effect on Welch’s songwriting should also be noted, as she began this journey around 2014, a year prior to the release of third studio album How Big How Blue How Beautiful. There‘s no denying that becoming sober may have saved her life and allowed a more clear-headed approach to the writing process, and Welch has noted several songs such as Cosmic Love and Shake it Out, two all-time greats, were conceived while hungover. Records 4-6 are also where we start to see a lot of 'fourth wall breaking' where Florence deconstructs her fame, performance and songwriting itself

And then there’s also the structure of the songs themselves. The songs on FATM 1-3 were hookier, more mainstream and radio-friendly and usually followed a neat verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus / outro format. Through 4-6, adherence to this structure began to decline, with some songs now sounding like poetry or streams of consciousness set to music. Heaven is Here abandons choruses altogether. The second verse on Patricia isn’t a neat mirror of the first verse, as with Ship to Wreck.

On choruses, within songwriting, much has been discussed about the decline of bridges and their importance of telling a story. Florence’s peer, Taylor Swift has been continuously praised for bucking this trend and being great at ‘building bridges’ across her 12 records. But, I believe the choruses in FATM 1-3 are masterful examples of storytelling and worldbuilding, outside of verses. Across 1-3, lengthy, descriptive choruses are used to set the narrative for the song (Drumming Song), continue or build on the narrative established in the verses (Cosmic Love) or reinforce the narrative of the song (No Light, No Light, Rabbit Heart, Queen of Peace). The chorus of St Jude, is even a genius triple entendre. But, across 4-6, choruses start to become repetitive (Hunger, June) or repetitions of the song’s title (Drink Deep, You Can Have it All, Dream Girl Evil, Daffodil).

Beyond Welch’s lyricism there are other changes that I think contribute to the superiority of FATM 1-3. The grand, wall of sound productions from Paul Epworth and their neo-gospel / soul leanings. Founding member Isa’s comparably lighter, airier but still maximalist productions and presence as a sounding board for Welch and the disappearance and gradual reappearance of the harp (which was gone by How Big but re-emerged with full force on Everybody Scream). Possibly the biggest factor may be the internalisation of criticism by Welch regarding the maximalism of her work “Early in my career, I was consistently ridiculed and derided for the bigness of my expression”. Attempts to embrace restraint began, unsuccessfully one might say, with How Big, as this album was the day to Ceremonials’ night. Efforts were actualised on the genuinely stripped back High as Hope and continued on Dance Fever, with much of the belting that characterised the band’s earlier work gone, perhaps as result of Welch internalising criticism.

All this is to say that while the band have been consistent across 6 brilliant records, to quote Sympathy Magic, there is an ""after and before"" best encapsulated in the Daffodil lyric “Made myself mythical. Tried to be real”.  Although I miss the bombast of the first three records, which I don’t think we’ll see again, it has given way to something more tender, raw and brave.",12,1763587601.0,FlorenceAndTheMachine,5,0.88,False

1p1kdy0,https://i.redd.it/jjv34b107a2g1.jpeg,The Corner: Part 4,"**Sins of the Father:** Saturday, February 21st, 1995

The thickness of black is ever consuming. As a small hint of light creeps its way across the floor, it shimmers over loose clothing, the musty carpet stein, the nightstand assortment of half empty pill bottles, the slight twinkle of a metal needle and finally onto the mid panic-stricken face of an unshaven John. As soon as the light reaches his eyes, they explode alive in a near instant as a panicked whimper is heard followed by the quick than slow release of breath. John lays there as if unable to muster any strength, with a cold stare up at the blank ceiling. Finally, the piercing sound of an alarm shoots the man into motion. As he gets up, the drawer opens and the rapid swiping motion of his arm launches all the nightstands amenities inside, followed by the subsequent slamming of the drawer. The routine draws to a close when the final articles of clothing are fitted on to the scar ridden body. John makes his way down the thin hallway into a modestly sized living room. As he approaches the kitchen attached to the room, Joel barrels through the front door.

“You’re finally up.”

John ignores him as he begins to prepare a pot of coffee.

“You know we got plenty of that downstairs right?”

Still no response as John sluggishly attempts to open the new bag of coffee grins. As he begins to pour them on the coffee filter Joel walks over an puts his hand gently onto john’s shoulder.

“You hear me, buddy?”

This alerts John who suddenly flinches rapidly and drops the bag releasing a flood of coffee grins all around the floor. John lets out a panicked yell,

“Shit!”

He immediately bends over and starts to try and pick up the loose grins. Joel steps over John and grabs the broom sitting against the wall and gathers the rogue pellets now consuming every inch of the tiled floor. John apologizes,

“I’m sorry, you, I was in my own head again.”

Joel continues to sweep, but gestures John to stop.

“it’s okay, that’s on me.”

Joel pauses,

“You having those dreams again?”

John nervously gets up, collects himself, and sighs,

“Yeah.”

“The usual?”

John subtly nodes. Joel finishes picking up the loose grins as John sits himself down on the stools connected to the kitchen island. As Joel empties the dustpan into the trash,

“I’m always here for you, these type things, well they don’t seem to get easier huh?”

Joel shakes his head.

“We’re coming up on the anniversary, aren’t we?”

John quietly nodes and remains silent while making a concerned stare towards the table.

“I heard on the news downstairs, another one of those stings happened. Way out west, who knows.”

This wakens John up a bit. He appears to be slightly aggravated.

“Sting this, new evidence that.”

John continues to sigh.

“Whats on the agenda for today?”

Joel sits directly across from John lighting a cigarette.

“We got a biggie today, called up about an hour ago. Big shot, goes by the name of Jack Clementine. If that name doesn’t spell prick, I don’t know what does. “

Joel lets out a big laugh as the ice-cold expression of John’s face melts into a chuckle.

“You tell the troops yet?”

“Been waiting for you big guy, this a team effort. Besides, they actually listen to you!”

Now they both laugh, and John’s posture straightens as he stands up.

“Alright than, can't mess this one up.”

“Well alright than!”

Side by side they head downstairs to reveal a brimming with life dinner. Thick windows line all around the lengthy assortment of booths that line the walls with the windows. The center console contains seats lining each available space facing inward towards the back wall. They exit through a side door into the tight kitchen area filled with smoke and the brimming scents of sweat sausages, and the hisses of endless eggs, pancakes, and bacon lining the long row of grills. Just past all the commotion of stressed line cooks and smiling waitresses, a young red-haired waitress is signaling them both to hurry over.

“You two done dicking around?”

She points towards the order window cut out in the wall, revealing a tall stoic man waiting by the front entrance.

“What do I do?”

Joel stiffens up while John remains calm.

“Get him the best seat we have, the one in the corner with a perfect view to the town.”

She is visibly jittery and tapping her fingers rapidly.

“Okay, but”

Joel cuts her off.

“Slow down. Take a second and breathe. In and out, in and out.”

John interjects,

“This is no different than any other customer you’ve served. I have all the faith in the world you’ll do great. Now go out there, apologize for the wait, and calmly seat him. You got this.”

“Okay but if he gives me any lip, I’ll walk out and”

John gives her a calm look,

“I have no doubt, now go and put our best foot forward.”

She takes a deep breath and slowly walks her way towards the exit door, right before she enters the main floor she turns to the two men, gives a sarcastic eye roll and puts on a big smile. They both turn to each other and John sighs,

“We’re in trouble, right?”

“Oh, absolutely but that pancake recipe of yours will do the trick.”

“Still, I’m gonna make sure this Jack character feels welcomed.”

John fights his way past the controlled chaos of the kitchen and makes it to the exit door. As he walks over to the calmly still Jack looking out into the town his vision begins to darken, his heart rate intensifies, all the scenery around him beings to fade, blurriness begins to take his vision, as he steps aside to catch his breathe in a nearby booth, mind numb, and an uncontrollable panic takes hold, the slight hum of a little girls voice echos in his mind, and in an instant he’s back. He looks around, and everything appears normal, he breathes in deeply, gets up and makes his way back to Jack in the corner of the room.

“Good morning, Mr. Clemingtine! I, John Winslow, the co-owner of this fine establishment will help you this morning.””

Jack turns slowly and clears his throat.

“It’s just Jack. But indeed pleasant.”

“I trust your service has been satisfactory thus far?”

“Adequate but that remains to be seen. Your pancakes are quite regarded.”

“I will not take all the credit, it is my family’s recipe, but yes, the response has been amazing. How have your other visits gone thus far?”

Jack perks up and maintains a firm posture.

“Pasqueli’s a few towns over was pleasant. My next venture will be an exciting one.”

“Oh, and what is that?”

“This new venture, that claims to be the new standard for fine dinning, Complete nonsense if you ask me, but still, it will get a chance to prove itself.”

“What is it called?”

“The Corner, this is the address, assuming you are interested. It opens next week.”

“I may have to indulge. Thank you, and please enjoy our fine establishment.”

John than walks away back the exit door leading to the kitchen. Joel is standing there waiting.

“So? He happy or what?”

“Seems to be, I don’t know.”

The waitress slams open the door to the kitchen, anger filling her face.

“The nerve of that guy! I’m sorry, I’m sorry but God.”

John and Joel walk over to reconcile her. Joel looks concerned,

“Slow down, what’s wrong? Another deadbeat?”

Joel begins to reach for a bat in the corner, but she stops him.

“No, stop it. It’s the fucking food critique douchbag. He just got up and left.”

John looks confused.

“What? I just talked to him, seemed fine.”

Sallie looks slightly confused but goes with it,

“Yeah well, the guy just stormed off. He looked kinda concerned about something, what gives, that was gonna be the mother of all tips!”

John steps out of the room towards the entrance and sees a car quickly pull out and leave in a hurry. It appeared to be a black bmw six series. He than heads back into the kitchen and asks Joel to step inside the office towards the back of the room. Inside the office there appears to be various assorted photos across the walls with Joel and John in various stages of their lives. The room is split evenly in the middle with John sitting on the left sides desk. On the desk is a small, framed photo of John holding Sallie in his arms. John looks to Joel concerned.

“I need to tell you something.”

“Is it about how are restaurant is about to go tits up?”

“No, its about that man.”

“The Jack d hole? Some kind of critique, not even trying the damn food.”

John continues to the have a concerned look on his face.

“I’m taking the next week off.”

“What do you mean? “

Joel lets out a sigh,

“It’s the dreams, isn’t it?”

“Yes, but its more than that. Jack mentioned this restaurant, The Corner, I need to investigate.”

“Jesus, not this again, you don’t have to.”

John slams his hand on the desk causing multiple pens and loose papers to fall over.

“I know what I see Jack, I don’t expect you to understand.”

A slight tear begins to form on John’s face, but he visibly attempts to fight it back causing an uncomfortable serious scowl to form.

“I just, I need to know for sure.”

“You have a fresh start here, let someone else be the hero.”

“Like I said, you wouldn’t understand, you’re not a father, like you even want to be.”

John pauses to calm down while Joel looks to the ground with disappointment written all across his demeanor. John takes a short than deep breath,

“Wait, I didn’t “

Joel puts his hand up to cut him off.

“Save it, I know I can't truly understand. And God help me, I won't stop you. But sometimes, you know, life is a tricky thing.”

John gets up and provides a quick but firm hug to Joel.

“I’m leaving tomorrow.”

John stops before the door to recalibrate his stature. With a firm grin on his face, he returns to the chaos of the kitchen.",5,1763587582.0,creepcast,2,1.0,False

I got rid of my big gaming PC over a year ago and for a long time that also meant no streaming. Lately I have been missing the casual hangouts and long chats, so I decided to try something different a very stripped down live setup that fits the rest of my life right now.

This post is a recap of that stream and a bit of a snapshot of where I am at with gear, hikes, family, work, and what comes next.

# A minimalist streaming setup

The old setup is gone. No tower, no double monitors, no huge mess of cables, no OBS scenes.

Right now it is just

* a MacBook in front of me
* a small DJI mic clipped on
* the laptop camera
* YouTube Studio for going live

That is it.

If I did not make hiking films for work, I honestly would probably not even own a laptop. I would just use my phone. In some ways this stream was a test to see if it is possible to show up with almost nothing and still have a good conversation. No music, no overlays, no screen sharing. Just a fire looping in the background and chat.

It fits where I am in life. Less gear, less friction, more direct talking.

# No more formal podcast

I finally pulled the plug on the podcast.

All the old episodes are gone. That probably sucked for anyone who was waiting for more, but it also feels like the right move. The plan is that these live streams and the little talks at the end of videos will take the place of the old podcast style content.

If you liked hearing me ramble about YouTube, money, travel and life, that is still going to exist. It will just be here on streams or tacked on the end of hiking films instead of living as a separate show.

# Minimalism, a baby, and the final boss

Behind me on the stream you can see baby toys scattered around the living room. That is life now.

From a personal standpoint I am more minimalist than I have ever been. Everything that is truly mine fits into a large duffel and a small duffel. That is my whole setup.

But having a kid is the final boss of minimalism. Babies come with bottles and toys and clothes and gear for each tiny phase. You buy things, use them for a few months, then they are suddenly part of the past.

If you are not sure about a second kid, you do not want to get rid of everything yet. So stuff sticks around. The game for me is to stay ruthless with my own possessions while accepting that family life will always involve a little bit of chaos.

# Life in cold New York

Right now New York is in that deep winter stretch. It gets dark early, the cold front has rolled in, and by the time we pick up Dean from the nanny it is too dark and cold to really be outside.

So winter life looks like this

* short pockets of daylight on the weekend to hit playgrounds and walk around Brooklyn
* evenings in the apartment with Dean, Ma, and Sasha the very sleepy Australian Shepherd
* lots of simple routine time together

We did a big experiment moving to Denver for a while. It gave us mountains, a car, Trader Joes runs, breweries and trail runs. It also left us missing New York.

Coming back reminded us why the city works so well for us. I describe it as living in a permanent city vacation. You walk everywhere, the parks are great, the food is good, the coffee is easy, the people watching is constant. It feels like a good place for Dean, for Sasha, and for us.

Will we rent forever or eventually buy something. I do not know. For now it feels right just to be here.

# The K2 film and what is coming next

The biggest thing on my editing plate when I streamed this was the K2 Base Camp trek.

It was twelve days of hiking in Pakistan, which is the longest trek I have ever done in one push. The film is cut and basically done. It is a long silent style hiking film with music, very old school in the best way, and it is just waiting on sponsor review before it can go live.

I edited it with the same mindset I have for all the newer hikes

* no wasted time
* clean pacing
* strong views
* a little context at the end

I am genuinely excited about this one. K2 gave me some of the wildest experiences and views I have ever had. I also still have an Italy hike to edit, so winter is mostly an editing season for me.

# A big car partnership and winter road trips

One of the bigger changes in my work life this season is a new contract with GMC. They gave me a car for six months through the winter and I am creating a series of pieces around road trips.

It is the biggest contract I have ever signed. There is a lot of process behind the scenes pitches, concepts, approvals, and the usual brand back and forth. My plan is to

* use the car for road trips around New York
* shoot hiking films and small commercial feeling pieces along the way
* play with adding a bit more personality and fun to the sponsored segments

So far that has meant an autumn hike in the Adirondacks with Sasha in full fall colors. Next ideas include Hunter Mountain, the Catskills, Montauk before it gets too cold, and some East Coast skiing with friends.

It is a different kind of project for me, but it also means more time exploring closer to home instead of always flying somewhere far.

# Future trek ideas

Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, there are plenty of ideas floating around. I usually do not lock anything in until around February, but here is what is on my radar based on this stream

* Switzerland again because it is becoming one of my most visited places
* Central Asia, including more Kyrgyzstan and possibly Tajikistan
* a serious trek in China near the border of Tibet with other hikers and YouTubers and local help for language, permits and logistics
* volcano hikes in places like Guatemala after loving Acatenango
* maybe Hawaii one day, after seeing how it is shot in various series
* smaller solo trips to places like Iceland or Slovenia if they make sense

The equation for any trip is always the same distance, cost, difficulty, sponsors and how special the route actually feels. Big travel and remote locations demand a big payoff in terms of experience and video.

# Hiking as a job and how the money works

People often ask how I afford all these trips.

The simple answer is that I get paid when I travel instead of paying to travel. The business is a mix of

* AdSense from YouTube
* affiliate links and codes
* sponsorships on the main channel and on trips

On an individual video, the AdSense alone might only break even against trip costs. The full picture is the combination of everything together over the long term. Hiking films bring in viewers. Viewers click guides and gear links. Brands pay for integrations and partnerships. It all adds up to a full time job that happens to involve hiking.

Because of that, most of my serious hiking is work. When I am home I do not go chase big trails just for fun. My off camera time is more about

* walking around New York
* taking Sasha to parks
* running in new cities when I travel
* family time

That is the balance that makes the most sense to me right now.

# Gear choices and staying simple

A few quick points from the stream on gear

* I tried testing iPhone footage in Apple ProRes for hiking films
* the image can look good but the battery life and heat are terrible on trips
* building a full iPhone rig with SSD, audio and power turns the phone into a bulky fragile block

After those tests I decided to stay with my Sony ZV E1 and a single lens as my main camera, plus a small DJI drone. I will repair my broken Sony lens instead of replacing the whole thing, because it is cheaper and I already know how it behaves.

For audio and daily life I like small in ear solutions. At the moment that means AirPods rather than big over ear headphones.

The pattern is the same everywhere in my life keep the tools lean, know them well, and focus on making the thing, not endlessly tweaking the setup.

# Being more private and choosing where to share

One theme that came up a lot is privacy.

For years I shared vlogs about my apartments, moves, relationships and day to day life. That phase feels like it is fading. I am less interested in blasting personal details to the full public and more interested in sharing with a smaller group that actually shows up and listens.

That might look like

* short talks at the end of hiking films
* informal live streams like this one
* a future private space for a subset of the audience

Streams feel like a good middle ground. The people who tune in for an hour on a random evening are different from the casual viewer who stumbles on a hike in their feed. I feel more comfortable being open with the first group.

# Advice if you want to start a silent hiking channel

Someone in chat asked if it is still possible to start a new silent hiking channel now.

I think the answer is yes.

There are still countless places to hike and film, and even well known trails can be seen in new ways with different weather, pacing, storytelling and eyes. If I were starting today I would probably

* begin with shorts to practice and build a tiny audience
* copy the basic structure of what already works so I can learn
* slowly experiment until I find a format that feels good to make and useful to watch

The loop you want is simple create something that feels meaningful to you and genuinely helpful or calming for viewers, then keep refining that format. Over time your audience learns what to expect and you earn enough trust that they will click on whatever you upload.

# Group hikes and the people who come

I have led around seven group trips at this point. The people who show up are mostly

* normal people with normal jobs
* long time viewers who just need a little extra push to try a bigger hike
* a few folks who also like photo and video
* friends I invite who are more serious hikers or creators

No matter how clearly you explain distance and difficulty, there is usually at least one person who is a bit less prepared than they expected to be. I try not to gatekeep too hard with interviews and fitness tests, even though some other creators do.

The result is a mix of personalities and abilities sharing a real experience together. It is always interesting hearing why someone chose that trip and what they hope to get from it.

That human side of trips does not always appear fully in the final films, but it is a big part of why I still like doing the occasional group hike.

# Closing thoughts

Winter Craig this year looks like

* a minimalist MacBook and mic instead of a huge setup
* editing big projects like K2 and Italy from a warm apartment in Brooklyn
* road trips in a GMC through the Northeast
* short cold days with Dean and Sasha and Ma
* fewer public vlogs and more selective sharing
* dreaming about future treks in China, Central Asia, Guatemala and beyond

The core has not changed much though. I still believe in using video, minimalism and travel as tools to build a life that feels interesting and honest. The details just look a little different now with a family, a car contract, and a city that feels like home.

For context:   
I'm a 26 year old stay at home mama of a 19mo toddler, my husband has a FT job, + works OT so I'm alone a *significantly large amount of time.* We are currently paycheck-to-paycheck   
(which is why he's working so much OT), so I don't have a lot of options for things for me & baby to do outside of the house. There are weeks at a time we don't go outside at all (except for maybe a grocery run or my occasional coffee splurge), *especially* now that it's getting cold outside. We also have a massive puppy (like, 90lbs and growing) who has really bad separation anxiety, so I can't really leave him alone long anyway or he will chew(we're working on getting him into training).

I wake up, tend to our baby, the dog, & that's about it. I try to squeeze in some personal time while baby is napping, but as most of y'all probably know, usually nap time is reserved for other chores such as cleaning up after the little tornado, doing dishes, meal prep, ect. I am the primary care-taker of the house, my husband does cook most nights he can, but I do have to cook most nights since he works until about 1am. Sometimes I do my best to stay up late so I can do my hobbies, but it's difficult because I'm a morning person at heart, plus I have to wake up with the baby between 9-10 AM no matter what. 

I don't have a lot of baby sitter options because, as previously mentioned, we're paycheck to paycheck, and we have an extremely small amount of friends/family we trust with the baby *at all*. So it really is just me, and my husband when he's home from work. 

I'm so incredibly lonely, and so incredibly burnt-out. I feel like I have almost *negative* amounts of free time, and no one to even vent to about my problems (external from this rant or not)

  
I'm looking for advice on how to not be burnt out, but also if anyone has any advice on how to make *any* side money with the baby with me 90% of the time. Any advice is vastly appreciated! ",1,1763587459.0,sahm,0,1.0,False

We opened with a POS that’s built for this kind of business, but I’m seeing so many inefficiencies, bad UI, and enough issues that it feels like there must be a better option out there. 

Here’s what we need a POS to support:
- typical cafe setup, food & bev sales
- open play, can be booked online or as a walk in
- monthly memberships with recurring payments, who receive open play once per day. Can book online or walk in.
- party and events bookings - currently we take a deposit online for birthday parties and process the remainder in store at the time of the party. Other events are purchased online in full (classes etc) at the time of booking, but can also happen as a walk in (very rare)

We’ve explored Square a couple times and from what I remember we’d have to use a 3rd party for the memberships/bookings piece of this. The one we were connected with was comically expensive and was really built for ticketing music events etc. We use square payments and I would love to use them but need it to be cost effective.

here are three of the most major things i *reeeaaaallllyyyy* think folks are missing out on, but perhaps might wish to pay a little closer attention to...

three questions i would ask for you to please consider:

* what are the odds that i know either of these two aforementioned individuals, my special friend and my other friend with legal complications, let alone that i happened to know both of them?
* what are the odds that someone would come forward instead of going straight to lawyers/the life to somehow earn a profit and try to take credit solely for themselves and demand that all royalties be paid to them, etc?
* **what are the odds off all of this occurring?**

these are some of the questions i began asking myself months ago when exploring an old joke of mine. after the exploration i did amend my joke, but folks didn't seem to find it funny and they once again dismissed me as crazy.

i need to add this in right here:

>those numbers are going to **rapidly** become *infinitesimally* smaller, not only based on current fact, but also based on potential and the very important things i think i should have verified, and why you may want me to have this all done.

onto that joke and its explanation:

for many years i joked with friends gleefully saying ""*i'm chaos incarnate!*"" as i was making light of my never-ending shitstorm of a life.

this year, as a part of all this, i began to explore into **chaos theory**.

lo and behold, that somehow weirdly fits my life too. so i amended my joke:

>""*i am chaos* **theory** *incarnate*""

like i said, it didn't go over well.

but now, if you've followed along this far and have begun to ponder those three questions of mine, i now have to ask you...

>is my joke really that crazy, or is it just weirdly possible that i am, in fact, some form of chaos theory incarnate?

fyi, there is another name for **chaos theory**:

>it's also known as *the butterfly effect*

<*gently>*: please go ahead and think about that one for yourselves too, i already have.

now, to tie this piece together a bit more and give you some fun insight on me:

[the first meme i posted to the memery: 2 pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/thememeryremains/comments/1llsu8t/chaos/)

     those memes are succinctly me
    
    i got lotsa weird humor in here
      doesn't mean i'm not a nice person trying to do good things
    
    chaos is my life
     and i try to make the most outta my life as i can
    
    you are what you are folks, right?
    
    this is what i do
     this is who/what i am
    
    i very literally make sense out of madness
     and this another thing i am trying to share with you 

\_\_\_\_

i'd like to move along to a quote and my personal two cents on it...

>""i had no idea that history was being made. i was just tired of giving up.""  
\- Rosa Parks

folks, i might be a little like rosa parks over here, but i am most certainly **not her**.

# i KNOW history is in the process of being made.

*how, exactly, do i know?*

# partly because i was tired of people giving up on me

and although i may, at times, have a desire to **not exist <- as in existential crisis** which might be a little worse than ""*just depression*"",

# i have a stronger will and desire to live

# and i decided to take my life into my own hands

# and i am sharing it with you all here and now.

*and i seem to carry a whole lot of weirdly good luck with me, as it so may appear...*

# as i -> just so happened <- to know the individuals involved in these upcoming things

one of whom i have known since high school.

now\*, to point this out one more time, folks:\*

>what are the odds that all of this, in fact, is real?  
what are the odds of it being recognized, pieced together, and announced  
by the individual experiencing it  
as they experience it  
in real time

>?

that's a whole lotta math i just don't have the time for, and i'm pretty sure even some of the most brilliant minds of this day and age would be challenged to find the answer for...

and i'm still in the very early stages of sharing **all of this**, with you the world, right here on reddit -> **for free**.

meaning that already miniscule number i just asked you to calculate?  
it's gonna get a whole lot smaller...

uhm....

anyone getting all this yet?

because, ultimately, what is my aspiration/ambition/goal with all of this that i'm doing?

>**i'm in the process of making history out of my personal history** *and i'm sharing it with you all here because i want to make the most legendary almost dare i say mythic level of autistic kyle/karening* **stink** *the world may never before have been privy to and i am also seeking support for from world along the way, if anyone would so choose to participate in this* ***global revolution*** *i am beginning to build over here.*

*i say* **global R E V O L U T I O N** *because i do not, in any way shape or form, desire to say or do anything that would bring about more* **unnecessary bloodshed** *to this poor suffering world of ours.*

*i don't want to die, and i hope you don't either.*

*the fact of the matter is we all might... unless no one else paid attention to this:*  
*every single warning sign is blaring a big fat*  
**R E D  A L E R T:  G L O B A L - W O R L D - W A R - I N C O M I N G**  
**WITH  M A S S - C A S U A L T I E S - A N T I C I P A T E D**

*->* **actually hear them as they have been calling to us** *and* **begging for** ***our*** **help** *to take down the systems which are binding us into submission, and they, being people of major influence, could help us all usher this process along quite a bit faster if we were all to organize this party in just the right way.*

>*so please, pretty pretty pretty please -> can we all learn from the various mistakes our known history is already showcasing for us,* **get ahead of the curve**,  
*and maybe -> just stinkin maybe*

*once again,* tying back to the whole *""****butterfly effect****""* concept and my personal ponderances of *""****wtf is 3i atlas*** ***really****"" <- suspicions/thoughts there folks, but all logic-based.*

yup....  
i have tied **all** of this together.

\_\_\_\_

to end this post, i'm going to clue ya'll in on what this post ""cost me"":

* 3 big cups of coffee, big here meaning 16 oz
* 3 actual cigarettes in addition to the occasional nicotine vape puff
* 7 or 8 batties of **superflux** [baby yoda](https://silverleafnj.com/menu/rec/superflux/baby-yoda-live-resin-infused-ground-35g) live resin infused shake *^(>pre-ground pot<)*
   * linked the strain for the connoisseurs out there to check out the stats rather than list them here
   * *translation for the non-pot-versed:* **this some strong and relaxing shit.**
* and about **8 hours**

>know that i am fairly pooped after all of this, both physically and mentally.  
not bad, just tired.

more to note: i'm not typically an early morning/start of day eater. it typically takes me a good couple hours or so to become hungry, and if i try to force feed myself *^(>which would complicate my weight issues further<)* i have a tendency to become physically repulsed and end up wasting food.

though i have yet to eat today, know that coffee is almost a meal for me as i use heavy cream for creamer most days. it's one way i keep myself nutritionally balanced in spite of having diagnosed **gerd**.

* sometimes i will add a pinch of salt to try and balance out a bit of the electrolyte imbalances caused by the diuretic effects of coffee, and sometimes add other spices such as cinnamon for its anti-inflammatory benefits.
* i will sometimes also add chia seeds, as a way of incorporating protein and fiber into my diet.
   * this also will help me to feel full longer and not overeat
* at this time, my gerd is and has largely been asymptomatic for near the entirety of this year, speaking as someone who spent decades on pills to manage those symptoms too and no longer has a need for them.

all of this this to say i'll take/share pics and stats later because it's about time time for me to get off this damn pc and focus on other parts of me and my life for a while.

back later with more ya'll!

I've been losing weight, slowly and steady, however now that the cold is here... it's becoming difficult! my instincts WANT to 'sin' so bad 💀

My food is cooked by myself, I use little olive oil and salt, I don't have diabetes nor cholesterol, but I'm very overweight due to a poor lifestyle because of trauma. 

here's what my diet looks like

Morning: I usually eat a piece of fresh bread with a fried egg and a cup of coffee with soy milk. 

Lunch: usually is a bit of pasta or rice, vegetables, and a bit of grilled meat or whichever dish I decided to cook for the week,

From there on I am not allowed carbs
So no bread, pasta, rice, potato. 

In the afternoon I usually eat an orange or apple

And dinner is a soup or salad and a natural yogurt

My calory count must be under 1000 for me to lose weight because of my lifestyle, I know the solution would easily be for me to exercise but moving is triggering for me, I'm trying to make some effort and exercise at my own pace.. Just don't make this an objective for now.

While the weather was hot, I was in heaven eating my fresh cucumber tomato salads at night

But now that its cold? I don't want anything cold and half of the time I don't feel enthusiastic for making soup nor eating soup, and my desire for cravings have gone over the roof, I start obsessing, thinking of warm pizza, I've started missing butter and it's just suffering to decide what to cook at night, thank god I don't have anything to put on bread or I know I'd already gone wild

Tonight I ended up cooking a sweet potato and I ate it with a bit of ketchup because I was going crazy, and it tasted like heaven 😭 help

Any ideas what to do at night to preserve my sanity while the cold is here?

I'm having a weird aversion to both soup and salad... ",1,1763587279.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,0.67,False
1p1k7xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosophy/comments/1p1k7xs/fvel_efvl_or_fevl/,"FVEL, EFVL, OR FEVL???","This is part “question” part “type me” 

I relate to all of these types so I can’t decide which one I would most likely fit into. 
I even looked at the accentuations of each aspect, but I can’t find myself fitting any flexible position (the 2nd aspect). I don’t relate to any of 2V or 2L and only some of 2F(-3) and sparse parts of 2E. I see myself really fitting for 1E-3 and 3E-1 the most, and for sure 4L-1 because I hardly bother with understanding deep meanings and constantly searching for logical explanations, I only do so occasionally when I feel like it. 

EMOTION: I am very self restricting with my feelings and I don’t let on how I feel immediately to strangers or in big groups of people. I hold back my feelings and I don’t even like crying or expressing myself with a group of people, i’m more of a one to one expressing person, but it’s also limited regarding negative emotions (sadness, pain, anger, fear, etc). I like talking about feelings and learning how people feel and process things, I like understanding people. When I feel a negative feeling where I want to lash out or express myself, I will be quiet and say passive aggressive or blunt things and usually I just go to my room to isolate and not look crazy in front of everyone. I feel my emotions very deeply and when people hurt me I do hold a little grudge until they make some effort to fix it, if not, I don’t care about them much anymore, and I won’t pay attention to them or want a connection. I try to build a free and safe space for people to talk to me, it doesn’t happen a whole lot except for people who come into my life then realize i’m more understanding and open when they get to know me. I’m not comfortable being too strongly emotional and I even hold back on saying “I love you” to people i care about, because I want it to actually feel real and mutual. I don’t have big reactions to things, sometimes I can lightly mimic others expressions but I really struggle because I usually don’t want people to know how I actually feel. (judgement from others scary) 


PHYSICS: I feel on and off with this aspect, I think I value it well though since I am very particular with what I surround myself with and fixate on material things. I like decorating things to fit my ideal style and fix and tweak things to look and feel better. I am somewhat judgmental of others spaces and things, I go through my mom’s room and move and arrange stuff a lot, same as in my own room. I am possessive and don’t like mixing or sharing my things with others very much, unless i’m scared lol. at school some people do use my things and I don’t have the guts to say no a lot, but at home I’m very different and around those I know and can predict better , i’m stingy. I can neglect myself and my space if I’m not feeling well or motivated to fix it up. I go on and off, bursts of energy and then I’m depleted. One week i’m pampering myself and doing my hair, skincare, makeup, then a couple weeks later I just give up. Things related to this aspect does usually motivate me, like waking up just to get a coffee and going to stores to look and shop and buy new things for fun and entertainment, laying in bed and feeling the nice relaxing feeling where I can just be free without tension and anxiety.

LOGIC: Like i said before, I don’t really bother much with this I think. I look into most things to get a direct answer and I stick with it for a while because thinking is exhaustinggggg. I don’t like theories much, debating, coming up with ideas or discussing anything requiring consistent logical reasoning and understanding. It burns me out so fast, the only thing I value enough to discuss logically is typology (but I usually just listen and see where I or someone else fits into the basic systems) and fixing errors in english vocabulary, spelling and grammar. otherwise tho, i turn away and don’t even wanna try much. well i do believe part of it is self doubt and also seeing logic as too complex. I literally say life and everything means nothing so that i’m free from going into depth about it. When I give advice it’s very straightforward and simple, I don’t discuss things for too long, I get a little irritated when people try and drag things on when it literally has a simple explanation…

VOLITION: I don’t have much will to do things either 😗. I mean, I won’t let others impose on me much either. I can see myself being a mix of 3V and 4V because I don’t like letting others decide things for me but I also struggle hard inside with wanting to do things myself as well. I can go along with stuff but I will feel uncomfortable and stubborn so I usually just tell people I got it by myself or completely avoid it all. Responsibilities and stuff is hard for me, I don’t always have the energy or motivation to be consistent or maintain things, I function on waves and bursts. I feel myself being influenced by others around me a lot, like when i see people doing stuff then i wanna do my own thing as well. Like with art I can internally feel competitive but i don’t admit it out loud and i put in effort just to prove myself i can do stuff and to others as well. it’s just also an insecurity.

I was overwhelmed by tax complexity and had no idea where my cash was going each month.

Solving it came down to two key changes:

First, I established residency in a state with no income tax before I left. This wasn't about skipping taxes, but optimizing them legally. By making a state like Florida my official domicile, I stopped paying state income tax to a place I no longer lived in, saving me thousands per year. I used SavvyNomad, which connected to my accounts and changed residency.

Second, I automated my financial tracking. Manually logging expenses was a chore I always quit. It gave me a real-time, weekly snapshot of where my money was going from coffees to flights without any effort on my part.

Why This Combination Works

Together, these steps built a financial foundation that travels with me. The residency change was a  massive change in my budget. This combination replaced financial guesswork with a solid strategy, taking the constant stress off my shoulders.",1,1763587206.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

The draw was tight, but I don’t know whether that’s a feature or a bug. I could easily see this cigar getting hot and bitter, but the snug draw forces you to sip and take your time.

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my.

During our conversations, he brought up the age difference and also shared a lot about himself on the first day, his salary, family, lifestyle, etc. His Hinge profile doesn’t mention what he’s looking for (long-term, short-term, etc.), but I was talking with him from a long-term perspective because that’s what I’m looking for. 2nd day he asked where do I way if more on my culture side or more to western side.. I said I don’t want to be in my culture basket instead I want to explore . 
We talked about love languages too, he said physical intimacy is important, while mine are quality time and open communication.
The next day, he told me he didn’t feel a romantic connection and would prefer to stay friends.

I started eating better when I got to 355lbs and was told I crossed into the diabetic range. I went keto and cut out all processed food, and got down to about 330lbs. Since going carnivore I have stopped all doctors and medications. I cut out all soda and coffee and only drink water. I feel better but not great. I eat 2lbs of 85/15 grams fed ground beef (the grass fed is actually the cheapest I can get at my store, cheaper than conventional 🤷‍♂️) a day with 1-2 tablespoons of added grass fed butter to each pound. I also eat 5 hard boiled eggs (conventional, can’t afford anything better) with each pound, and the only seasoning I use is pink salt. The reason I’m doing ground beef is because it is all I can afford. I have also started taking a grass fed beef organ supplement (as I don’t eat organ meats). It says take 6 capsules but I think that’s crazy so I do 3. I also take fish oil. I was doing one capsule per day, but recently increased it to the two capsules, which is the recommended dose. I was having dandruff of my head and beard, as well as skin issues that have gone away. I just don’t feel as strong as I was, and that I am not optimally healthy (I know I’m still huge and probably not going to feel great anyway yet).  I have noticed recovery seems to be faster when it comes to sore muscles and or pausing and continuing exercise. However, I feel like my weight loss should be greater especially with how big I am (about 290lbs now) and how much more active I’ve become. I aim for 7,000-12,000 steps a day, but with the rain recently I haven’t been hitting it. Also I noticed if I eat bacon (the sugar free heritage bacon), or cheese (Kerrygold grass fed hard cheeses) I do not feel good, so I’m not really sure I’m getting enough fat, or not. Some days I feel heavy and weighed down, other days I feel like I’m skinny and can do anything. Is this normal, am I on the right track?  I did slip up once or twice by adding garlic and bell pepper to my meal but it was an instant regret.

1p1jqht,https://i.ibb.co/8qjnDNT/file.png,Tiny Breaks Can Stop Stress,"In today's fast-paced world, stress is an ever-present companion for many. Our lives are punctuated by the constant demands of work, family, and societal obligations, which can leave little room for recovery of our mental and emotional well-being. Fortunately, research suggests that incorporating brief periods of mindful breathing into daily activities can be an effective strategy to counteract the negative effects of stress.

Understanding Stress Relief through Mindful Breathing

Mindful breathing, particularly when practiced even for as short a duration as 60 seconds, can play a substantial role in stress reduction. This technique involves focusing your attention on your breath and becoming aware of each inhalation and exhalation.

- **Biological Perspective:** The practice of deep, mindful breathing is known to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes a state of relaxation in the body. This physiological process counteracts the body's stress response, which is typically governed by the sympathetic nervous system.
  
- **Hormonal Impact:** Stress initiates the production of hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. While these hormones are crucial for the ""fight or flight"" response, prolonged exposure contributes to chronic stress and associated health issues. Mindful breathing helps reduce cortisol levels, promoting a sense of calm and improving the body's ability to cope with challenges.

- **Emotional Regulation:** Regular mindful pauses contribute to emotional stability. Taking deep breaths provides a moment of clarity and composure, allowing individuals to reset their emotional baseline. This can lead to better decision-making and cognitive function under stress.

Integrating Mindful Pauses into Your Day

Implementing mindful breathing into your routine does not require significant time investment or a change in environment. Consider these simple methods:

- **Set Regular Reminders:** Schedule brief check-ins with yourself throughout the day to focus on your breathing.
- **Pair with Routine Tasks:** Integrate mindful breathing with daily activities like waiting for the coffee to brew or during a commute.

1p1jokn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MazeRunner/comments/1p1jokn/my_take_on_the_newt_sexuality_controversy_with/,My Take On The Newt Sexuality Controversy With Fresh Eyes,"(This is pretty much a repost of a comment I left on another reddit post about the controversy.)

I have not begun reading the series yet, but am interested in it. I’ve seen the controversy about Newt’s sexuality, and after having read James Dashner’s reply to one person’s comment on twitter, (the comment in question which people cite as evidence to Newt bring gay), Ive concluded that no, Newt is not gay. (For the TLDR, scroll down,) The comment in question was actually the second part to a two part comment. As you can see, in the end of it, there is clearly a “(2/2)”. Dashner says that after the influence of the fandom, he believes that Newt is gay. Emphasis on BELIEVES. I can BELIEVE that coffee is a soda, but at the end of the day, it isn’t, is it? Yes, James Dashner is the author, he can do whatever he wants with his characters, but essentially, what he did was remove himself from the situation as the author and placed himself on par/level with readers. He’s speculating that Newt is gay, just as fans do. And, if you look at the comment before that he left, the “(1/2)” then you’ll see that James Dashner basically says that he feels it would be dishonest to say that Newt is gay when at the original writing of the book series, upon the CANON of the book series, Newt was never intended to be gay. So in the books and their canon, and assumedly, the movies, based off the books, the canon is that, Newt is straight. Or at the very least, his sexuality is not specified.

Also, we can see that the comment James Dashner was replying to puts pressure on him, essentially calling him and his actions hypocritical.

(Which, I must say, I respect James Dashner for how he handled the situation, he established his writing at it's purest and truest with the canon as Newt being straight or his sexuality never specified while since his original intent for the books was for Newt not to be gay, but he also appeased fans and leveled himself with them, showing that the books are finished and what has been established in them, set in stone, leaving even he, himself, the author, only to speculate and interpret. Respect to him for handling the situation so beautifully well.)

Evidence: Here’s the link to the (1/2) comment James Dashner posted right before the comment many people cite to claim that Newt is gay.

 [https://x.com/jamesdashner/status/1336775453755895809?s=20](https://x.com/jamesdashner/status/1336775453755895809?s=20)

Here is the link for the (2/2) comment, made right after the (1/2) comment,

[https://x.com/jamesdashner/status/1336764019512766464?s=20](https://x.com/jamesdashner/status/1336764019512766464?s=20)

  
(And for those of you who like me, want to get a full picture of things, here is the comment that James Dashner was replying to,

[https://x.com/viszart/status/1336761780866002945?s=20](https://x.com/viszart/status/1336761780866002945?s=20)

and the tweet made by James Dashner that THAT person was replying to,

[https://x.com/jamesdashner/status/1336759551714988033?s=20](https://x.com/jamesdashner/status/1336759551714988033?s=20) )

And for those of you who like me, know what the last sentence of James Dashner's ""(1/2)"" comment means, but there's big words so you gotta double check and make sure it says what you think it says, I pasted the sentence into ChatGPT and asked what it meant, and ChatGPT said,

>^(The sentence means:)

>^(The author didn't want to go back after the fact and declare something as official or part of the ""true story"" (the canon) if it wasn't originally intended that way.)

>^(Breaking it down:) ﻿﻿

>^(- Retroactively = doing something after the fact; adding it later.) ﻿

>^(- Canon = the official version of events or details in a fictional universe (characters, relationships, world-building, etc.).)

>^(- Disingenuous = dishonest or not genuine.)

> ^(So the author is saying:)

>^(""It would feel dishonest for me to go back now and claim that some idea or detail was always part of the official story when it actually wasn't."")

>^(This often comes up when fans ask whether a certain interpretation, relationship, or background detail is canon, and the creator doesn't want to rewrite history just to satisfy expectations.)

So For the Too Long Didnt Read: So basically, overall, Newt is not canonly gay, he is straight or at the very least, his sexuality is never specified and the books have never given evidence that he is gay. James Dashner, after seeing the passion of his fans, aka, his fans INFLUENCING his take on this, he believes Newt is gay. He basically removed himself from the situation as the author and placed himself on level with the readers, as someone looking into an already established universe and world with already established characters, leaving him only to speculate and interpret. He removed himself from place as author and aligned himself with the readers and interpreted Newt as gay. But at the time of Newt’s writing, at the original books, creation of the movies, and very likely, Newt’s novella (released months before the reply about Newt’s sexuality was made), Newt was not gay and was never intended to be gay.

Sorry for the long comment. Here’s my take on the situation, with fresh eyes coming into the fandom and the controversy. I'm excited to start reading the books and eventually watch the movies after reading them. Thank you for your time, and have a nice day. God bless you.",0,1763586008.0,MazeRunner,8,0.13,False

Since then, we barely had any cup of coffee without issues. The main issue seems to be triggered by attaching the water filter: Every time we put it into the water tank the machine says the water circuit is empty and needs to be filled. When we do so, it will often keep prompting the same message. Usually this message disappears after removing the water filter. After putting in the water tank a few times the message either stops or we get fed up and just keep the filter out. Surely this can't be normal?

Other issues are:
- The drips from the spouts are uneven. The left side will drip and the right side will have a small stream
- This also means when we make 2 cups at the same time, one cup will be off by approx. 60 ml compared to the other
- Today when preparing a cortado, before adding the milk the machine randomly started a cleaning cycle and never added the milk. Similar things happened over the past few days with other milk infused drinks.

I might be forgetting some but we have cursed this machine a few times already and it's only been a few days so far... Customer service told us to use it for a week, clean the spouts with a toothpick or brush and rinse the infusor. We did all of those things. Drip was supposed to even our after 5-10 cups but so far the issue is still here.

“Give me that datapad!” a tall scrawny human with small sunglasses and a white scarf wrapped around his neck said gruffly. A shorter human with a black turtleneck and checkerboard pants offered the taller man his datapad.

“I’m sorry, Marcell. I just don’t understand why they won’t listen to me,” turtleneck guy said with clear frustration.

“Yes, yes, I heard you do your best,” the man replied. “Not your fault we’re dealing with an ignoramus. Oh? You heard that? What would you call someone who claims the very ship we’re expecting is in another system and won’t be here for a week? Oh, Jackie-baby, can you check with the coffee cart? I could use a washed Ethiopian pour over.”

The shorter guy smiled, nodded, and hurried off. Evidently he’s Jackie-baby, and the tall one is Marcell?

“Darling, I need you to stop wasting my time and tell the pilot to get here. We’ve got a schedule to keep and this isn’t funny anymore,” Marcell continued. He was clearly older but not anywhere close to advanced age. His face was a bit gaunt with hair that was silver, but not a natural silver of an older human. It seemed somehow brighter and a bit artificial, and artistically messy?

“Look, I checked in with the embassy and they told me there was a Terran Red Cross vessel sitting up here. It’s a bit smaller than the one you showed me, but I can work with it,” he continued with a pout. The man then leaned his head back to stare at the docking bay ceiling while shaking his head.

“Oh, dear Lord. I can’t believe I have to do this. Hold on, I’m taking a picture and sending it to you,” the guy said while holding the datapad up at our Sabaric 951. “See what I told you? And I’ll admit this one is camera ready, unlike the drab old thing… What? What do you mean you’ve never seen that starship in your life? If it isn’t part of the Red Cross fleet, why the hell is it painted with the Terran Red Cross on the side?”

“Can I help you?” I offered tentatively.

“Who…” Marcell started with irritation before he caught his first glimpse of me. After seeing me standing there, he leaned down and with his left hand drew his sunglasses down to the tip of his nose to stare at me.

“Well, now. What do we have here?” he said with a smile and a wink before straightening up and looking away towards the ship. “Huh? Oh, looks like the pilot just got here and they’re a morsel. Why don’t you… hold on a second.”

He turned and looked at me and smiled warmly. “What’s your name, darling?”

“Haasha?” I responded, still not sure what the heck was going on here and why this strange weirdo was staring at our ship.

“You’re the pilot of this vessel, right?” he asked and seemed excited when I nodded. “How about this. Why don’t you just call the embassy and inquire about the vessel. The pilot named Haasha is rather distinctive, so I have no doubts you’ll get this all sorted. Circle back with Jackie when you get the details.”

“BUT…!” I heard a loud voice from the datapad call out as the tall guy in front of me casually turned it off.

“Come, come, Haasha!” Marcell bellowed out while flicking a finger towards our ship and striding towards it.

*VIP Haasha, I have received a rather rushed message from the Terran Embassy. You are being requested as a pilot. The Terran Red Cross is shooting something important.*

“Shooting what, Tac-1?” I asked under my breath as I jogged to catch up with Marcell. “It’s not like our new ship has a railgun.”

*The notification suggests shooting refers to making a promotional holovid, not military action.*

“Wardrobe! Come to docking bay 47 and bring a hair stylist. Bring the writers, too. I’ve got notes and rewrites. There’s a lot of work to do and I haven’t even seen the interior of the ship yet,” Marcell said quickly into his datapad and hung up before the person on the other end could respond. He then looked down at me. “Ugh. That shiny void suit has got to go. It just won’t work for the scenes I’ve got in mind.”

*It appears that you may be more involved in this project than just as a pilot. Thankfully, since you have not been eating copious amounts of Halloween candy like humans at the embassy, the appropriate answer to the question ‘Does the camera make me look fat?’ will be no.*

Yep. I still need to talk to Rosa about updating Tac-1 to have… tact.

The next hour was a whirlwind of activity led by Marcell, who I quickly discovered was the director. I was a bit hesitant to become involved until I got a rather terse message from Captain Victor. The TEV Ursa Minor would receive one fee if I simply assisted as a pilot. If I agreed to the on screen roles proposed by Marcell, the fee would be rather more substantial. I was strongly encouraged to fully participate to help offset the cost of the paint job on the ship. Who would have thought a few extra sparkles on the hull would get the captain’s undies into such a twist?

It turned out the entire project was a much bigger deal and I would have jumped to assist even without “encouragement” from Captain Victor. The historical Red Cross had originally operated on a basis of “screw politics, we’re helping anyway” and eventually became one of the earliest, most vocal, and most successful proponents for unity among humanity before they reached the stars. They were one of the key players that helped guide humanity into the unified and tolerant people I know today. Upon entering spacefaring, the Terran Red Cross expanded its role to deep space rescue in addition to disaster relief.

They have some of the bravest humans willing to drop into combat zones without weapons and before the Terran Marines arrive. They operate rescue ships patrolling minor routes that rarely see space traffic and are already expanding to visit rarely contacted backwaters and obscure mining operations. This promotional holovid would be part of humanity’s effort to educate the galaxy and let them know the Terran Red Cross stands ready to help in any emergency. I was proud to help their efforts, and really couldn’t object much since my current assignment was to put on an old tattered void suit and play dead.

We did three takes of me lying “injured and lifeless” on a deck with exploded conduits nearby. Just ignore the exploded conduits were primary FTL junctions and if they cracked an entire ship would be atomized. I was told it’s something covered by a willing suspension of disbelief or some nonsense, but as a technician it drove me bonkers. The entire point of the scene was to show an injured sapient and the Terran Red Cross swooping in to save me.

And save me they did! The shot opened with me lying on the deck, then quickly panned over to a human-led medical crew swooping in to put me on a stretcher and rush me off screen.

I thought things went well until after the third take and Marcell yelled, “Cut! No, this isn’t quite working. Give me a moment.”

He stood there thinking for a minute, then walked over to me.

“Haasha-baby. I’m not quite feeling the moment,” Marcell told me while steepling his hands and putting them up to his nose and mouth in apparent deep thought. He then spread his hands wide and continued. “You don’t exude dying in the scene. It’s limp and lifeless. I don’t feel any emotion. I’d rather not replace you in the scene as I think you have real talent. I just need you to be… more dead. Channel your inner lifelessness, and let the audience feel your pain. We need… drama! You understand, don’t you?”

I just looked at him dumbly and blinked. I needed to be more dead? All I did in the scene was lay there on the ground until the other actors rushed in and put me on a stretcher.

“Wonderful!” he exclaimed before I could give him any actual response. “Everybody, take five while props does the reset. Makeup, Haasha needs a touch up before the next take. The camera isn’t picking up the desperation of the moment.”

I then got fussed over by makeup, which consisted of using some sort of gel to make my fur look messier.

‘Well, he wants drama, I’ll give him a drama queen,’ I thought as I settled back onto the deck. I arched my back uncomfortably and waited. When placed on the stretcher, I flopped my head back. The motion was completely unrealistic and would never happen in real life. If you’re lying on a stretcher, gravity will do a good job of holding your head in place. Heck, in artificial gravity your head likely wouldn’t flop back dramatically at all. Maybe just bob a little bit in the weightlessness.

“And… cut! Oh, my dear Haasha. That was simply wonderful! Extraordinary! Truly a perfect example of method acting,” Marcell called out excitedly. “I could feel your desperation through the lens. Send that take to the editors immediately, and let’s move on to the next scene!”

The next scene had me on edge, which it shouldn’t since I wasn’t in the shot or a part of anything except standing around and watching.

Since our ship was shiny and freshly painted, Marcell wanted to use our cockpit for some set up shots showing human pilots flying into an emergency.

Have you ever seen a pair of ignorant ba’cheks slapping control panels randomly? These so-called “actors” couldn’t tell a sublight engine modulator from a landing strut switch. Their idea of looking realistic was to randomly put an arm out to tap a random button or make a dramatic flurry of flipping switches. Most of which if you flipped them randomly like they did would send you crashing into the nearest celestial body and your death.

As painful as the sight was, it shouldn’t have been an issue since I put the entire ship into test mode where theoretically they couldn’t cause any harm. Until one of the idiots decided to start dramatically flipping switches on one particular control panel. The exact one that held the system in lockout, had the emergency controls that cannot be bypassed or disabled, and other things I stressed to the actors should never be touched.

I watched in horror as the actor flipped a safety cover off one of the most important “don’t press this” switches and then… pressed the damn switch. The drives instantly spun up and the countdown for them to engage came up on the screens.

“Ugh, what is this nonsense on the screens?” one of the actors said with disgust.

“Why is it saying warning, imminent FTL jump? I thought this thing didn’t have FTL drives because it’s so small and cramped,” the other whined.

Me? I was bolting past the camera crew and dodging all the makeup artists to get to the main panel in Engineering. Luckily, it was still 20 seconds until the drives came up to full power and would have attempted to jump, and I quickly overrode the emergency switch they pressed.

“Guys, I really need you to never touch the panels at your knees,” I scolded the actors when I returned to the cockpits. “That switch you just flipped nearly engaged an emergency liftoff and FTL jump while we’re on a space station. The results could have been catastrophic. You can play with any other panels except those two. This is a live vessel, and not a simulator.”

“I need to talk to my agent,” one of the actors called out in a shrill voice. “These are unsafe working conditions, and I don’t think I can continue!”

“Outrageous!” the other bellowed out. “How can the audience see my calm and steady demeanor as a pilot if I have to reach up to flip a switch and block the view of my face? Where’s Marcell!”

They fell to pieces… because I said they couldn’t touch one little red switch I cannot disable under galactic law. One covered by a safety lock, I might add, that takes real intention and effort to bypass to get to the switch.

Marcell took nearly 30 minutes to calm them down. In the end he convinced them that a red button on the right side of the main control panel was a more dramatic choice and let the audience feel the intensity of the action as the actor leaned forward rather than fiddled with something. He also promised to pan into a close-up of the actor’s face so the audience would read his gritty intensity. 

Two takes and nobody getting handsy with the wrong control panels later, Marcell had the shots he needed. Both the actors made a point of speaking quite loudly as I hopped into the cockpit and returned the ship to normal operations for the final take Marcell wanted to capture.

“Well, I’m never working with HER again,” the first said while giving me a glare over his shoulder.

“I completely agree!” the second responded. “I plan to have my agent lodge a complaint with the Actor’s Guild. For someone who worked reasonably in front of the camera, she should know how to treat fellow actors behind the scenes.”

They then stormed off while demanding some weird wheatgrass smoothie drinks from catering. Salads are bad enough, and you want to turn one into a drink? And humans wonder why the galaxy has concerns about their sanity.

Marcell seemed completely oblivious to their idiocy as he sat down in the co-pilot’s chair and started blabbering at me about his vision. I pretty much tuned out until he got around to plotting the flight route I would take for the final shots. That was actually pretty fun as we got to play with the nav systems in unique ways to plan out the position of the freighter, the camera shuttle with the angle of its primary lens, and my vessel. 

Why was I flying this Red Cross ship from behind a freighter and dramatically past the camera? Marcell had a vision. What kind of drugs or insanity induced that vision, I have no idea. It’s art and I’m here to pilot, not ask questions.

10 minutes later, I was back bundled up inside my void suit with Tac-1 connected as co-pilot and we were out in space. I spent the next 45 minutes running safety and flight tests on the ship, the very tests that I had actually been heading to the hangar to run before getting hijacked into a promo holovid. The timing worked perfectly as I wrapped up my tests and finished up writing my reports just as Marcell called out over coms.

“Darling, I need you to do one flyby of the camera shuttle closer than the original path we discussed. The naviguy here is sending a flightpath he assures me will capture the beauty shot I need,” Marcell's voice called out over coms. “Just do a loop-de-loo and continue on behind the freighter and do the thing we discussed.”

“Confirmed and lining up for a flyby,” I responded, adjusting course and performing the long loop.

The thought occurred again that I really had no clue why this shot would have me flying from behind a large freighter and doing a flyby across the camera view at an upward angle. It just seemed weird. But he’s the director, and the rental fee for the ship might just get me out of sparkly prison with the captain and Auggie if he likes the results.

“The angle of movement! Nearly poetry in motion,” Marcell called over coms after I completed the flyby. “Just one thing. Is there anything you can do to add a little pizazz?”

*VIP Haasha, this Sabaric 951 is equipped with turbothrusters and we have not yet done a check of that system. We could use them on the next attempt. This would complete the final item on our flight tests and is also our only option to satisfy Marcell’s request for… pizazz.*

“Copy, Director,” I responded. “This ship has one trick we can try. I’ll line up for another pass.”

I looped behind the freighter and waited for Marcell to call out, “Action!” I then moved on the predetermined flight path.

*Minimum safe distance achieved for turbothrusters.*

Given the go-ahead by Tac-1, I engaged the turbothrusters. After a short lag while they spooled up, the ship made a sudden leap forward and we accelerated much faster than I expected. I let them run and was excited to find out how quickly they got me to cruising speed. Not massively useful, but very fun!

There was a scream over coms from Marcell, and I was worried I was about to get chewed out.

“SPECTACULAR! Amazing! Got it in one take!” the director’s voice exploded over coms. “The vibration of the camera as you passed was perfect. I’m glad I thought of the extra pizazz. That’s a wrap, everyone! Pack up and let’s get everything over to editing.”

I was a little confused what he meant by the vibration of the camera, yet here’s what I learned the hard way about turbothrusters. They’re banned in the production of all new vessels except military, and use of turbothrusters is heavily regulated on any old vessel like ours that’s grandfathered in under the law. Here’s why.

Standard sunlight engines will generate a bit of a shockwave as they move through space. It’s pretty gentle and dissipates entirely once beyond 100 meters from a ship, so only the physicists and space nerds care about how it works as it’s never strong enough to affect neighboring vessels or space stations.

When turbothrusters engage, they put out a sudden significant shockwave that can mess with the gravity generators of any ship or station within 1000 meters. And in the end? A turbothruster just gets you to cruising speed faster. It doesn’t get you a faster cruising speed because sublight physics still apply. Take a wild guess how many rich pricks showed off their shiny new Sabaric turbothrusters when leaving a station, and how quickly station authorities started demanding regulations. 

As a result, when I engaged the turbothrusters the resulting shockwave rattled both the camera shuttle and the freighter I flew from behind. Marcell was unexpectedly happy. The human captain of the freighter, who happened to choose that exact moment to try to take a sip of his coffee? Decidedly and unexpectedly unhappy when the coffee went down his shirt instead of down the hatch.

What the hell is it with humans and coffee? The jerk wouldn’t accept my apology and offer to replace his shirt. He just made some odd comment about hotshot maverick pilots showing off and busting towers. Nope, Captain Blabbermouth turned me in and got me a 1000 credit fine.

What a shn’iks.

Luckily, it takes between 9 and 12 days for caffeine to leave your body and for your nervous system to reset.

It's one of those processes that you don't realize how badly you need it until you complete it. To some, 12 days seems like hell when uncaffeinated, to others, it seems like a necessary sacrifice to preserve long-term energy

\-----

# What caffeine is doing to your nervous system

Caffeine mainly works by blocking adenosine, a chemical that builds up in your brain during the day and makes you feel sleepy. When caffeine blocks adenosine, you feel more awake. It also nudges up dopamine and adrenaline, which is why you feel focused and wired.

If you drink caffeine every day, your body adapts. Over time:

* Your brain changes the number or sensitivity of adenosine receptors
* Your stress system adjusts to regular hits of adrenaline
* Your sleep architecture can shift, even if you think you “sleep fine”

This is what people mean when they say “caffeine does nothing for me anymore”. Your nervous system is not broken; it's just adapted.

\-----

# Signs you need a caffeine reset

A caffeine reset is about reversing some of that adaptation.

You probably need a caffeine reset if caffeine is part of your baseline, not something you feel occasionally. Some clear signs:

**1. You need caffeine just to feel “normal”**  
You don’t feel awake, functional, or even vaguely human until your first coffee or energy drink. That’s dependence, not a helpful boost.

**2. Your usual dose does nothing**  
One coffee used to make you feel sharp. Now you need two or three to get the same effect, or you feel nothing at all. That’s tolerance building up.

**3. Your sleep is worse, even if you fall asleep fast**  
You might still fall asleep after evening caffeine, but you:

* Wake up during the night
* Wake up unrefreshed
* Feel heavy and foggy in the morning. Caffeine can reduce deep sleep and shift your sleep cycle, even when you don’t notice it directly.

**4. You feel wired but tired**  
You feel mentally restless, overstimulated, or jittery, but physically tired. That “tired and wired” mix often means your nervous system is getting constant stimulation with no real recovery.

**5. You get headaches if you miss your usual dose**  
If a late coffee or missed energy drink gives you a headache, irritability, or a weird “pressure” feeling, that’s a withdrawal pattern. Your body is expecting caffeine at set times.

**6. Your anxiety feels worse on high caffeine days**  
Shakiness, racing thoughts, fast heartbeat, or a sense of internal “buzz” that tips into anxiety are all common with high or frequent caffeine use, especially if you’re already prone to anxiety.

**7. You drink caffeine all day, not just in the morning**  
You reach for caffeine through the afternoon to push through dips. That usually means your sleep, recovery, or workload needs attention, and caffeine is masking the problem.

**8. You can’t imagine going 24 hours without it**  
If the idea of 1–2 caffeine-free days makes you nervous, that’s usually the clearest sign a short caffeine reset would help.

\-----

# When to do a caffeine reset

The best time to do a caffeine reset is when your life can tolerate a short dip in energy, focus, and mood. For 3 to 7 days you’ll likely feel more tired, a bit foggy, and maybe irritable, so timing matters.

Use these guidelines to fit a caffeine reset around your lifestyle instead of fighting it.

**1. Avoid high-stress periods**

Don’t start a caffeine reset when you’re:

* In a crunch period at work (big deadlines, launches, exams)
* Managing a major life event (moving house, new baby, family crisis)
* Already running on poor sleep and long hours

During these times, losing your usual caffeine boost can make everything feel harder and increase the risk you’ll give up halfway.

**2. Use quieter phases to your advantage**

A caffeine reset works best when your schedule is calmer. Good windows:

* A lighter month at work
* After a big project has finished
* Annual leave or a staycation
* School or university holidays

Holidays can work well because you can nap, go to bed earlier, and don’t need to be “on” all day. Just watch out for social habits like “coffee dates” that might tempt you back in.

**3. Check your sleep and recovery first**

You’ll handle withdrawal better if your basic recovery is already decent. Aim to start your reset when:

* You can protect 7 to 9 hours in bed most nights
* Your wake and sleep times are roughly consistent
* You’re not regularly staying up very late or working nights

If your sleep is chaotic, fix that first or at least improve it a bit before you remove caffeine.

\-------

# What you gain from an effective 14 day caffeine reset

When you stick with resetting the nervous system by quitting caffeine for 14 days, the changes are usually obvious by the end of the second week. You’re not aiming for perfection, just a clear shift in how your body and brain feel without constant stimulation.

Here’s what tends to improve.

**1. Caffeine feels powerful again**

The most direct outcome is lower tolerance.

* One small coffee or 50–100 mg of caffeine feels noticeably stronger
* You don’t need constant top ups to feel awake
* You can use caffeine as a targeted tool, not background noise

That makes future caffeine use cheaper, lighter, and less tangled with your identity.

**2. More stable, natural energy**

Without caffeine propping you up, your body’s own alertness rhythm starts to show.

Common shifts:

* Mornings feel heavy for a few days, then gradually clearer
* Afternoon energy dips are less of a crash and more of a gentle slope
* You rely more on food, movement, and sleep, and less on stimulants

You get a much cleaner sense of what “tired” actually means for you.

**3. Better sleep quality**

Even if you could “sleep on caffeine”, most people notice changes after a reset:

* Falling asleep becomes easier and quicker
* Night-time awakenings reduce
* You wake up feeling slightly more refreshed, even on the same number of hours

You’re removing a drug with a long half life from your system, so your nervous system can downshift properly at night.

**4. Less background anxiety and jitter**

For a lot of people, regular caffeine and low-level anxiety are tangled together.

After an effective 14 day reset, many notice:

* Fewer heart flutters and less inner “buzz”
* Less edge and irritability, especially in the late morning
* A clearer link between real stressors and how anxious you feel

If you still feel very anxious once caffeine is out of the way, that’s useful information you can act on with proper support.

So… context: I work with a small team of colleagues that I’ve always *liked*. We’re not best friends, but we get along, laugh together, and share coffee breaks. Nothing dramatic. Until recently.

In the last month, a weird dynamic started forming. Two colleagues have begun treating me like I’m their emotional dumping ground. Every single day, the moment I walk into the office, they start unloading: gossip about others, complaints about their partners, random drama, passive-aggressive comments about work… and somehow it always ends with *me* being the one who has to soothe them or give advice.

At first it was fine. I like helping people and I’m usually the calm one in the group. But lately it’s draining me. I feel like they don’t even ask if I’m okay, they just show up and pour everything on me. If I try to change the subject or say I’m busy, they get weirdly offended, like I’m abandoning them.

The final straw was yesterday. I was having a genuinely bad day and told them I needed some quiet. They both rolled their eyes and joked that I was “acting sensitive again”. I went home feeling like crap.

Now I’m stuck between two thoughts:

1. Maybe I’m overthinking it and I should just ignore them.
2. Or maybe I’m letting people cross my boundaries because I don’t want to seem rude.

I’m not confrontational, at all  and the idea of talking to them directly gives me anxiety. But I also can’t keep being the office therapist for two grown adults.

 Should I say something? Distance myself? Or am I just being too sensitive?

My experience with them has been decent, but, as a part of the buying experience, I noticed that they did not seem all that knowledgable about ebikes in general.

I recently took my Tern for service at a store that specializes in ebikes. I was talking with the ebike shop guy and he complimented me for having such a cool bike, he said he really liked the Tern and that it was a great brand. So, I asked him, since they are one of the only ebike shops in town, why they don't sell Terns if they think they are good bikes?

He said that Tern only sells authorizes its bikes to be sold in one store in our mid-sized American city. They would not let other bike shops sell Terns.

When I asked him why, he said that most brands do that with most bike shops in order to keep prices high, so that bike shops are ""not in a race to the bottom"" in terms of price and so that there could be lots of bike shops with a ""sustainable"" way to profit. He said not all bike brands do that, but most of them do.

I am not a lawyer, but that sounded a lot like price fixing and establishing exclusive territory.  

So, I asked r/cycling if this was all true [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1os81h3/are_us_bike_shops_price_fixing_and_allocating/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

The best answer from a bike shop was this:

>I'm a dealer for many brands. Here is how it goes.

>Price fixing? Yup. Absolutely. As a brick and mortar dealer, we are not allowed to sell our bikes online, and we are not allowed to advertise them at a price below what a given brand allows. For example, if you see a bike on Specialized's website for $2000, that is our price too, and we are obligated to advertise (if we so choose) the bike at that price. Now, we call sell the bikes for whatever the hell want, we own them, but we cannot advertise a lower price.

>There are several reasons for this, and one of them, is to not undercut other dealers, and pit us against each other. The brands don't want two stores in the same market selling bikes at different prices, that is bad. For everyone. Us bike shops, we work together. It doesn't benefit us to get into a reverse auction bidding war with another shop. *No one* benefits from that on the seller/dealer side of things.

>If my bike shop offers you favorable pricing, and you shop that price around, we'll not honor that price if you return. Conversely, if you bring us another bid from a different shop, and ask us to offer a better price, we will tell you to kick rocks. Why? Because us bike shops are all in this together. This includes the distributors. They don't want us getting into a reverse auction bidding war with other shops either. No one wins in that scenario.

>Now, for territory, yes and no. We are a Pinarello dealer. There are probably a dozen nice bike shops in our town, and there is only one other shop selling Pinarello. If you open a shop, and want to deal Pinarello, that is going to be *really* difficult for you to get your hands on those bikes. Why? Because the market can only accept so many Pinarello's, and the brand knows this. They don't need 5 dealers selling 4 bikes a quarter about to go out of business. They want 2 dealers selling 10 bikes a quarter, and doing well, with the shelves stocked full of nice bikes.

>This is how most brands work. With few exceptions. The big one being Trek. Trek doesn't want the LBS to do well. Trek wants to *win.* They want to dominate the shop floor and take over the shop. This is why that brand gets a bad rep.

>Exclusivity is also a thing. The 2026 pre-season is happening right now. Those bikes are starting to hit shop floors. When we go to put in our order for MY26, there is only so many of those bikes to go around, and it's going to be the shops that are actually selling bikes that get them allocated. Example, the 2026 Specialized Crux is gone. I cannot buy it. Those bikes all went to dealers that placed big pre-season orders. So, if you open a shop, and want to stock Specialized, well, good luck with that. You'll be able to buy the Sirrus, and the Roll, but you'll not be able to get your hands on the good stuff for a hot minute. Brands will take care of the shops that are doing volume on their bikes. Like, in this Pinarello example above, all the bikes are coming to these two shops. If you want to get in on the action, the brand isn't going to take that away from established dealers and cut you in, because why would they? They've got an already established LBS doing *work* for them, and there is only so many of these bikes going around.

>So yeah... if you want to stock a certain brand, you pretty much need to wait until another shop goes out of business. This happened to us recently. We've wanted Pivot for a long time, and when the shop across town decided to call it quits, we scooped up that market segment, and now we are the Pivot guys. This is how it goes.

>It's not that brands want to keep the bikes exclusive, its just that it doesn't benefit them to have their bikes in every shop. You want a small number of shops selling a lot of your bikes, not a large number of shops selling very few of your bikes. 

My question: are bike shops doing something illegal here? Is establishing a territory in which a manufacturer only sells to one bike shop (most bike shops are often not affiliated with the manufacturer, this is not like Starbucks selling its coffee only to Starbucks shops).

I’ve mostly dated women but had plenty of hookups with men and had started seriously dating men this past year or so. 

Connection was so strong during that initial week we had met that he invited me to come back and stay with him for a week before starting my degree program in September. Convos were nonstop after I left the trip in the following weeks and were pretty intimate and sexually charged. Felt very natural but def very quick and heavy.  

So, just a month after meeting him, I flew back for the planned week with him. I had a decent week but he was sick for a lot of it (genuinely, it wasn’t an act haha) so nothing physical really happened. Conversations and vibes were great but he finished the week by saying that he’s not looking for a relationship rn due to his insane work schedule and a heavy family event he’s been deeply processing from earlier this year. But he was wanting to stay in touch and see me when he’d be back in the states. 

Fast forward 2 months later, communication had really pulled back as a result of his work/processing. Things had become still sweet and friendly but sexually it had really stalled. But he was still saying he wanted to see me when he’d be home for a day or so in October to see family. That “day” turned into a 1-2 hour coffee/lunch (with not a lot of communication on his end leading up to it) so I ended up rainchecking. 

We didn’t speak for about 2 weeks after that and then I broke the silence by just apologizing for putting any pressure on the connection to happen when he had told me he wasn’t looking for something serious. He clarified that I’d done nothing wrong and he thought super highly of me. 

It’s been about 3 weeks since then and we haven’t spoken. But he’s liked some of my IG stories since then and is supposed to be back home for a long several month period starting in mid December… Back in October, we had talked about linking up during this period… but obviously at this point I plan to respect his space and not reach out. I don’t really expect him to either given his recent actions but I’m just trying to figure out how to move forward from all this, especially if he does in fact reach out to see me once he’s home…

Half of me reads all this as he’s lost interest and is trying to be a friend to me. but another half thinks he’s does have feelings but just isn’t ready or wanting to take action to acknowledge them. Either way, Ive started to see someone else (who is great and actually looking for a relationship haha) and I wouldn’t end things with them to restart what I had with the last fella^. So… this is more for my sanity and understanding as a guy who hopes to find an amazing LTR with a man at some pt.

lf anyone’s had similar experiences with gay men who are less experienced with dating and who also lean more avoidant that could provide some insight, I’d appreciate it! ",0,1763584770.0,AskGaybrosOver30,6,0.33,False

I run a logistics team down here in Dallas. Between the constant phone calls, the missed shipments, and the endless spreadsheets, by the time 3:00 PM rolls around, my brain usually feels like it’s been put in a blender. I used to cope by downing a third cup of coffee, which just left me wired but tired—staring at my screen but getting nothing done.

I kept seeing ads for **The Brain Song**, promising to ""switch on your brain."" I’m a practical guy—I don't meditate, and I don't do yoga. I thought this was just New Age fluff. But I was desperate for something to help me focus without the caffeine crash, so I figured, ""What the hell, it’s cheaper than a week of Starbucks.""

I bought the digital package and downloaded the tracks to my phone. Here is the honest truth about how it went:

* **Day 1-3:** I felt ridiculous sitting in my office with headphones on, listening to these ""binaural beats."" I didn't feel smarter. I just felt like I was listening to weird humming.
* **The ""Click"" Moment:** About a week in, I tried their ""Deep Focus"" session during my afternoon admin block. usually, I check my email every 5 minutes. I put the track on, and the next thing I knew, an hour had passed. I had cleared my entire backlog. It was like putting blinders on a racehorse.

The biggest win for me hasn't been ""becoming a genius."" It’s the **stress regulation**. There is a specific track in the folder called ""Stress Relief"" (or something similar). When I get home, instead of bringing the work stress to the dinner table with my wife, I listen to that for 10 minutes in the driveway. It’s like a reset button. It flushes the cortisol out. I walk inside actually feeling like a human being again.

**Does it work?** If you are looking for a magic pill, no. But if you need a tool to force your brain into ""work mode"" or ""relax mode,"" it’s surprisingly effective.

Since I mentioned this to my team, a couple of my guys tried to buy it. One of them tried to save a few bucks and bought a ""download link"" from some random forum. It turned out to be a broken file that was just looped rain sounds. **Don't be cheap with your brain.** You need the high-quality audio files from the official site for the frequency layering to actually work. The compression on the bootleg versions kills the effect.

I’ll drop the link to the legitimate site in the comments so y'all don't get burned.

**TL;DR:** Replaced my afternoon caffeine with this audio. My productivity is up, and I’m less cranky when I get home. Worth the investment.",0,1763584768.0,AMLCompliance,0,0.33,False

We are big foodies but pretty much into anything and really like street food places.

Definitely a bit of a coffee snob and only really like going to locally run coffee shops not chains.

In terms of things to do were going to go to the Christmas markets and potentially the zoo and also a science museum but if people have any other suggestions that would be great.

1p1iwuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1p1iwuj/i_am_so_sick_of_my_living_situation/,I am so sick of my living situation,"Hi everyone I’m so sorry this is going to be long my roommate just made me upset for the hundredth time and I just need to let it all out. 😅

I (21f) live with my roommate (21f). I’ve known her since December 2023 and we were best friends. We had went to the same college. We were inseparable all of 2024 and when it came for me to transfer to university (I got my AA) we decided to live together. It wasn’t necessarily what I wanted to since I wanted to try the college lifestyle of living with people from the same school but within those last few months of 2024 she told me all of this stuff that happened with her boyfriend whom she lived with where he abused her and even held a g*n to her head. I felt horrible and wanted her out of that horrible situation so I offered to move in together and in the mean time my family invited her to live with us. When we started looking for apartments she claimed she needed to have a bathroom attached to her room (we were both going to have our own no matter what) which I was slightly bothered by but it wasn’t the end of the world for me. I just insisted that I wanted a walk in closet. She had tried to have her friend move down to our state as well even though I told her I was not comfortable with that after I met her because we did not get along and she would always complain to me that her friend would make fun of her weight. Again annoyed, but still wasn’t the end of the world because I knew I just wouldn’t sign the lease if it came down to that. Then she was looking at apartments where she would get her attached bathroom and then I would have the guestroom, which was noticeably smaller in all aspects. Again annoyed since I was the one who needed to move and I invited her since she had a bad living situation (she had other options it wasn’t she had to live with me). Eventually be compromised and found an apartment that worked. 

When we moved, she told me how she signed up for dating apps and was going to go out with all these random guys. I never minded. I just told her I did not want them in our apartment. The first day they meant or for her to have hook ups in our apartment because I didn’t know these men and neither did she. Lo and behold she brought numerous random guys to our apartment that she had only just met. 

When we move together, she told me she was going to get a puppy and I told her she should not because it was a tiny apartment and she had dogs she had adopted. She left with her supposedly abusive ex boyfriend. So she flew to another state to buy a puppy specifically a very large dog breed which does not fit well in our tiny apartment. Additionally, she kept telling me how much she did not like her ex-boyfriend or his family yet she went and visited pretty much every week. 

At this point, we’ve been living together about three months And I stopped cleaning up after her because she would always leave dishes in the sink, leave the kitchen a mess, the living room is constantly a mess from her dog, and she did not clean up after it properly when it would use the bathroom inside. So eventually, I just stopped cleaning up after her, which resulted in it being a mess to the point we have roaches (funnily enough. I was in her room the other day and and she had three climbing around. Where is my room has none 🤔)  even after she would make it a giant mess I would still clean it up every once in a while and when my boyfriend would come to visit, he would help me clean because it was just so messy. Yes I have told her. It’s a mess and should be cleaned. She just did not care. She did work two jobs at this point, but she didn’t need both of the jobs one of them she didn’t even show up to half the time. So that was always her excuse about not cleaning.

Her puppy needed to go out of town and like I said, I did not want this dog so a couple of times she tried to have me take care of it by taking it outside when she didn’t wanna pay someone to watch her (she changed her schedule and will text me at three in the morning asking me to take her dog out still she hasn’t done it recently because I always say no) and my boyfriend comes for a weekend maybe twice a month and one weekend when he was here, she tried to make us watch the dog because ‘we don’t have anything better to do’. She’s also told me on multiple occasions that my boyfriend is only with me because he’s desperate and can sleep with me (she also told me she’s sat outside my room to try to hear us which I told her was weird). 

She thought somebody broke in so I told her to go see what happened (this was via text) and she told me she was scared. She works in security and does this for work and her dog is a guard dog. But I told her if she really thinks someone broke in to call the police. She did not, and instead ghosted me for half an hour to the point I was crying because I thought she had died. Then she texted me telling me she was doing the dishes.

Over the summer I was at home working but was still helping pay for utilities and the apartment. I paid the electric and she paid the Internet. I had told her that since I would not be here and it was summer and going to be hot. We need to split utilities (it was about even prior). She cranked the AC down to 70° and turned it so it was on constantly then would give me maybe $20 to help cover it (usually she didn’t give me anything). When I was gone, there was a leak and our roof was completely water damaged. She was texting me about this and I told her to call the emergency maintenance people because I was not there, and I had to be up in six hours for work. She instead went to bed and waited the next day to try to deal with it. She just told them and then when they did not come for a week, my dad had to call and threaten them because she wouldn’t be an adult and do it herself (Like I said I was at home and my dad wanted me to put it on speakerphone then he just took my phone from me when I was talking.) 

For her birthday, she told me she wanted to spend the day with me so I drove back earlier than I was supposed to, and I set up the entire living room with decorations, bought her a birthday cake, and bought her a ton of gifts. Instead, she went to go visit her ex-boyfriend and spent the day with him. When she finally came back to our apartment where I was sitting around all day because she told me she wanted to spend the day with me. She told me I needed to go to my room because she was having someone over to hook up with (a guy from her job who is married.)

Someone broke into her car, then lied to the police about what had happened and I think she gaslit herself into believing it. She said she put her stuff in there before work and then when she ran inside someone broke in so the police told her someone was watching her, put the stuff in there and leave it.. she always left her stuff in the car and she was working night shift and was the middle of the day. 

Over the summer, she texted me asking if I could pretend to be a burglar and attack her to see what her dog would do. I said no, and her dog would attack me and the bite marks and she was annoyed at me for not wanting to get bit. 

She used all my dishes and put them in the dishwasher that is broken so all of my dishes grow mold, and this was when I was gone over the summer (and I was only here on weekends again working) and wasn’t here to clean them. When I came back after the summer I got really sick and bought water bottles and Gatorade so I could hydrate, when I went home so my parents could help me she drink all my water and Gatorade and I had nothing when I still needed it when I came back.

She got really mad at me for some reason she wouldn’t talk to me and I genuinely don’t know why she was mad at me because we had not spoken for days prior since I was really sick and wasn’t here and she was slamming things and the new dishes I brought that were dirty because I was eating dinner she would clean them use them and leave them worse off so I had to clean them. She started being nice and talking to me because she wanted to use something of mine. 

She often brought people around without telling me prior so I would be in the living room before she and her dog took it over in my pajamas and all of a sudden her and a random person would just walk in. So I have people over without telling her now she gets annoyed and slams doors and is snotty at them.

She was in a very bad car accident out to 2024 and my family dropped everything to go pick her up in the middle of the night and let her stay at my house for a couple of days. When I was in a car accident she asked what happened and then wanted a recipe. Didn’t even bother asking if I was okay. 

Someone in the unit above us got stabbed and she told me the police were banging on our door asking for a camera footage and told her someone was murdered above us. She woke me up to share this information even though I had to be up early and she kept me up until 4 am. Thinking back to it, her dog didn’t bark, and her dog always barks when that door gets opened or is knocked on and yes, somebody was stabbed, but they did not die. 

She told me her parents don’t help her financially ever, but her parents send her probably $2000 a month yet she can’t help me pay for the super expensive electric bill (she still drops the AC to about 70° and has it running 24/7 and leaves all the lights on). 

She bought a fish and then left it in her room without being fed for a week and she just vanished and didn’t tell me where she was going. She also leaves all the windows open and goes to work so I’m on my own despite still believing someone was murdered above us.

She was mad because I did not spend my birthday here because she wanted to celebrate with me. 

Her dog either still pees all over the floor and she just doesn’t clean it or she truly just sprays Febreze on the floor by my room and then when I ask her why the floors are sticky she tells me she freezes the floor. She has a blanket in the washing machine full of dog pee, so I have not been able to do my laundry. 

She still makes comments to me saying she thought something was disgusting so she thought I would like it. She thought something looked ugly, but would look nice on me. I made dinner this weekend and she told me it smelled disgusting but that it looked edible. 

She has made plans with me countless times and then ghosted me. 

She’s had her supposedly abusive ex-boyfriend to our apartment and had him stay multiple nights in a row. Apparently she had a procedure done, which was a shot in her back and she wasn’t able to do anything on her own.

Today I had to volunteer this morning and then I had class right after so when I got back, my hands were full of what I brought and I bought a coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts. I’ve ordered DoorDash multiple times and her dog would always try to get out and I would tell her it was trying to run away because she would ask why I was yelling at her dog. And she always told me it would not run away. Today I opened the door as soon as I open the door the dog bolted so I dropped everything and chased it. Then she walks up and asked what’s happening and I told her her dog that doesn’t run away, ran away. So she called her dog over and brought it inside and I said great now my five dollar coffee is all over the floor and she told me ‘well what am I supposed to do about it’. Like I just wanted her to apologize because it should not be a fight just trying to walk inside of the apartment I also pay for. Like I mentioned prior her and her dog have her room, the living room, and basically the kitchen with how messy it is 95% of the time. Then her way of making up for it is by buying me stuff. She’ll buy me food basically. Today her ‘apology’ food is something from Crumbl. I just hate it I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and she just amplifies it. It’s at the point where I have to take antidepressants for my depression, anxiety, and OCD. Our lease ends in January, but I am subleasing an apartment next month so I’m almost done with all this nonsense. 

If you made it to the end, thank you so much and I’m so sorry for my giant rant. I have just been in a fight or flight mode since basically March. It’s so overwhelming and I know for a fact, I’m missing information in there, but I just kind of wanted to brain dump before I had to leave for work.",1,1763584233.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I go there every morning to read the Catechism and do my Bible studies.

Now when I come in, some of them hardly acknowledge me, and there has definitely been a shift.

I currently have a cheap $80 De'Lonhi EC260BK I had asked for for Christmas two years ago just to see if I would even like making my own espresso drinks. Safe to say I do! But this machine is already on its last leg, leaking water from the bottom among other things.

I am ready to upgrade, but I am a bit overwhelmed over all the options and combo machines out there.. Is there a machine you would recommend that doesn't break the bank but is really only a smidge more advanced than beginner?

About me (per the wiki); I am from the eastern USA. My usual drink is some sort of iced latte or shaken espresso. My usage is limited to weekends only, regularly double shots. And if my boyfriend sees me making one, he'll usually ask for one as well. So never typically a need for a large amount of pulling. As for space, I am currently building a coffee bar, so I am able to work with the average espresso machine size. My experience level is pretty basic - I dont have any special tools (only using what came with the unit), and I have only ever used pre-ground, store bought Cafe Bustelo. Additionally, I have never weighed my doses, just went off of vibes. I do think I would like to eventually get into grinding my own beans, so possibly a machine which includes grinder and dispenses the proper amounts - but I am not sure what price points these usually come at.

I have seen some machines which include possible combos with Kcup drip coffee, pot drip coffee, and/or cold brews, but the ones I have looked into usually don't have the best reviews.. Are there any of these worth it in your opinion? (My week-day coffee drink is a Kcup). Lastly, and this may even be forbidden to ask this here... but given my typically espresso usage, do we think I would be better off with a Nespresso machine? I've never had or used one of these, but honestly I am not so avid of an espresso user to look into grind size/temperature/ratio/etc. ",3,1763584011.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

I'm absolutely sure I have B12 deficiency, there's just no way I could have optimal levels with how my gut health and general mental health have been. I have so many symptoms of B12 deficiency but most of them are psychological:

- depersonalisation, derealization 24/7. I've had it slowly creep up on me for so long it's getting hard to tell what reality is supposed to feel like, what's just brain fog and what is dissociation. I know I haven't always had it, so something caused it. But these last few years, after getting COVID, mold symptoms, vaping and increased gut and food intolerance symptoms I barely feel like myself alot of the time, much less grounded and in reality. My surroundings are blurry and far away and I feel like my sense of self shifts every few weeks, and I can't recognize who I was just a few months ago. It's like I have no identity. I have constant brain fog and it's exhausting and painful to not be able to be myself, except if I down a ton of coffee and the stimulation masks the symptoms for a day 

- depression and anxiety. This has gotten much worse in the last couple years and I swear all my symptoms also got worse after vaping, which I've heard depletes nutrients. I have no motivation, I'm extremely negative and feel low self esteem and I need constant comfort and reassurance from my bf just to get through the day. Everything inside just feels....wrong. Even my good moods feel off, like it's me being slightly manic or stimulated but not genuinely happy. 

- terrible terrible memory, which makes me feel even less like me, reduced verbal fluency when I used to be a very eloquent and confident speaker, having to mask to keep up with conversations. Sometimes I feel like my brain is deteriorating so alarmingly I start to panic remembering who I used to be, but it feels farther and farther away.

- majorly worse ADHD symptoms, when I used to have much more drive and excitement and spark that could push me through them. Every year they get worse and it feels physiological. I can't get any goals done, I have irrational procrastination to the point it's unreal, I avoid tasks chronically and I feel I have literally zero control over my actions.

My life is at a standstill. I'm not working, I barely socialize, I sleep for 10 plus hours and still take hours and hours to feel like I've woken up. It's like I'm paralysed.

I’m looking for someone to sign a lease with me in this 2 bed 2 apt in Mid-city (s wilton pl and venice are the closest corner). I was supposed to move in with my current roomie but she decided last min to move in with her bf:/

It was built earlier this year everything in the unit/bldg is brand new. I was able to negotiate the base rent down from 2.8k to $2,685. However, single parking spaces available for $150 each (still less than 3k in total so it’s a really good deal). It also comes with in unit W/D. I'm looking to move late November between Nov. 25th - Dec. 1st.

I'm hoping to find someone who is in their mid-late 20s/ early 30s, working professional (or at least stable income), chill/easy to live with, tidy, respectful, and aren’t super sensitive to little noises as I can be a night owl lol.

A little about me: I'm 27M, filipino-american and work as a FP&A fully on-site.
Outside of work I'm into fitness, cooking, checking out different coffee shops and restaurants, traveling, going to shows/ concerts and festivals, and just exploring the city. I also love making the apt feel homey so i like keeping my space and the common areas aesthetically pleasing and clean. I like going out but i'm also a bit of a homebody so I don't mind staying in every now and then. 

If you think we can be a good match as roomies, feel free to dm me on ig @noel.hosmillo so we can chat more! :)

I've been single for a couple of years after being in relationships since I was 29. I find online dating to be frustrating currently, because they give you so little space to really describe yourself! A handful of pictures, maybe a few short blurbs about your hobbies (or a few sentences), and that's it. So, after stumbling on this subreddit, I thought I'd give something different a shot.

I'm white, 38, 5'11 and 175lbs with brown hair and a beard. I wear glasses and I'm practically blind without them. I live and work downtown. My current job involves a bit of travel, but nothing excessive, and overall I now have an amazing work-life balance with low stress. 

I've got a variety of hobbies. I'm a fan of soccer, in particular EPL, and try to watch at least one game a week (time permitting). I love to travel, but I'm not really an all-inclusive / beach person. I much prefer actively visiting historical sites, museums, food tours, nature preserves, etc. I'm fond of camping and hiking, in either the early spring or late summer/fall (the bugs eat me alive if I go anywhere in Ontario in the summer). I'm a fan of the arts, in particular live theatre (Fringe festival is my favourite time of year in Toronto), live music (mostly metal and classical), and live comedy (improv more than standup). I enjoy going to the ROM and AGO, and smaller museums. I'm a foodie and I'm always down to try new restaurants (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are my favourites).

For quieter hobbies, I'm into tabletop and board games, and video games. I follow a number of different podcasts, like OSPod, Sounds like a Cult, and Moviestruck. I'm a voracious reader; mostly science fiction, fantasy, and history, although I will dabble in other genres when something appeals to me. I will watch a variety of TV shows, although I'm not really a fan of reality TV. Movies I'm down for pretty much anything, although my favourites by far are Horror and Action (especially older martial arts films).

My friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, considerate, and contemplative. I'm quiet, but not because I'm shy, rather because I prefer to listen. I think things through before I respond. But on the right topic I will absolutely talk your ear off.

If you've made it this far, you're wondering what am I looking for? A long term partner, but not keen to rush things. I'd rather spend quality time together through our shared hobbies and interests, and learning about what you enjoy in the hobbies and interests we don't share!

I am now single. I work very closely with this coworker and we sit in close proximity when we’re in the office. So, he would always make comments when he was working from home asking if I missed him and generally having some banter, which is what I thought it was anyway..

But now I’m seeing some signs, like when we’re talking about things, he’s staring right into my eyes like he’s looking into my soul. We do sometimes get coffee together and just talk and we get on well. He has given me compliments and gets close when I’m showing him my screen. He’s put his arm around me for a work photo op and mentioned I should have his personal number. Recently he told me he was seeing someone etc. I remember when I was with my ex he would like hate hearing about my home life with him and never even acknowledge him which was weird.

Embracing Each Day’s Gifts: Wisdom from Marcus Aurelius
=======================================================

Have you ever felt the rush of opening a gift? The excitement and anticipation fuel your spirit as you peel back the wrapping, eager to see what’s inside. Similarly, life itself is full of these moments—every day offers unique gifts waiting to be unwrapped. The philosopher Marcus Aurelius once said, “Each day provides its own gifts.” This timeless wisdom encourages us to recognize and embrace the daily blessings amidst our routine and chaos.

Discovering the Gifts Around Us
-------------------------------

Every morning is an opportunity to start anew. As Lamentations 3:22-23 beautifully expresses, “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning.” This scripture reminds us that each day is loaded with divine mercies and gifts.

Take a moment to reflect on your daily routine. What are some small blessings you might be overlooking?

- A warm cup of coffee or tea.
- A smile from a stranger.
- The beauty of nature during your commute.

By becoming more aware of these simple pleasures, we can cultivate gratitude and joy.

Finding Value in Unexpected Moments
-----------------------------------

Often, the most significant gifts come disguised as challenges. James 1:2-3 offers profound insight: “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.”

Imagine a difficult circumstance that ultimately led to personal growth or a new opportunity. Can you see the hidden gift in that experience?

- A job loss leading to a career change.
- A relationship challenge deepening your understanding of love.
- An illness prompting a newfound appreciation for health.

Reflect on how your past challenges have shaped your current blessings.

Everyday Gifts from God
-----------------------

Life’s gifts are not always material; often, they’re deeply spiritual and emotional. Philippians 4:19 reassures us, “And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.” This means recognizing God’s provision in:

- Emotional support from friends and family.
- Strength and courage in trying times.
- Wisdom and guidance through prayer and scripture.

Consider the spiritual gifts you receive daily. How does acknowledging them impact your perspective?

Reflection and Interaction
--------------------------

Now, let’s bring these ideas into your life. Here are a few questions to ponder:

- What is one unexpected blessing you experienced today?
- How can you cultivate a mindset of gratitude for the gifts each day offers?
- Who can you share your daily blessings with to spread encouragement?

Sharing your experiences not only reinforces gratitude but also inspires others to recognize their blessings. Feel free to share your reflections in the comments below.

Conclusion: Unwrap the Gifts of Today
-------------------------------------

Each day is an opportunity—a fresh start filled with unique gifts waiting to be discovered. As you continue your journey, remember: it’s not only about the grand moments but also the subtle joys that offer profound enrichment.

Start your day with anticipation and gratitude, eager to uncover the blessings ahead. Take a moment now to think about what you are most grateful for today, and share your thoughts in the comments. Let’s inspire each other to see the beauty in every new day.

Implementing these practices in your life will help you unwrap the gifts of each day with a heart full of gratitude and joy.

1p1iluk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/1p1iluk/what_age_would_you_like_to_die/,What age would you like to die?,"After working in Healthcare for many years my plans of living to an old age has changed drastically.

I used to think that'd Id want to live to a very old age, however after seeing what life is like for the majority of the elderly I'm not so sure about that anymore.

Your best case scenario, which is roughly 2% of the elderly population that ive seen is that you live independently at home after dodging nearly every single health ailment life can throw at you (Stroke, heart attack, cancer, falls) and you die suddenly while drinking your coffee. If you have kids that call you frequently they'll find your body that day before it rots into the floor. 

# That is your best case scenario #

More than likely if you live to an old age youll be so crippled that cleaning becomes impossible and daily living becomes a bigger challenge everyday. If you made lots of money maybe you can afford yourself a stay at a nursing home that'll drain your bank account faster than you ever grew your wealth. Sure someone cleans for you and your meals are prepared but even still this is only as long as you have enough money. The other downside is that that the nursing home will more than likely be your final destination. 


You'll watch your friends there slowly die off knowing that one day youll be next. Your kids maybe will visit a few times a year. If your lucky youll keep your wits with you but your body will still continue to gradually decline. Cleaning yourself becomes nearly impossible. You gradually lost the ability to walk. One day youre using a walker, next year your in a wheelchair stained with urine and feces. 

You can now longer go to the bathroom un assisted. Your nursing home tells you that they cant take care of you and you have to go to another facility thats fully staffed in order to take care of you. Going to the bathroom used to be a private event. Now you have a CNA with a butterfly tattoo on her neck waiting for you to have a bowel movement while she checks her phone as she sits in your wheelchair. 

You start feeling your memory fade. Every day is filled with pain. You begin to develop bed sores on your bottom from all the sitting. Your teeth have all but cracked and worn down to nubs and you now require all of your food to be pureed to keep you from choking to death. 

You cant remember where you are anymore, your kids only visit on major holidays for an hour maybe. The closest contact youll have with another person is when the CNAs dress you in the morning with clothes that your family got from good will.

Your entire existence is now bound to a wheelchair. You can no longer tell the CNAs when you need to go to the bathroom. You just go. If youre lucky one will smell you and take care of you promptly. Otherwise youll have to sit in youre filth for a while until someone decides to check on you.

You'll continue doing this until your body starts to completely shut down. You can no longer feed yourself so now someone spoon feeds you the same mash they've been feeding you for years. 

Only once they've sucked your bank account dry will they finally place you on end of life care. Your brain is completely gone and you spend your final moments, mouth agape with someone coming in to check if you've died yet. Only once your body has completely used up everything will your heart finally stop and you can be at rest.

Ive seen so many people meet this fate between 75 and 85.

So what do you guys think? I used to dying young from terminal illness would be the worst thing in the world. But what if you knew you only had 10 years left? Would you be worried about making it to 75 if you knew what the outcome could be like if you make it that long?

A terrified Long Island mom’s quick-thinking but devastatingly painful choice helped save the life of her toddler son over the summer — and eventually revealed the exceptionally rare condition he suffers from.

“Picture breathing through a milkshake straw, then breathing through a regular straw, then trying to breathe through a coffee straw,” Maria Carlin, 36, recently told The Post of her 4-year-old Jack’s harrowing experience in late July.

“We got to a point where I said to myself, ‘It doesn’t get higher-pitched. … I know what comes next.’ \[His breathing\] just stopped.”

Carlin, a nurse [at North Shore University Hospital](https://nypost.com/2025/10/01/us-news/northwell-enlists-former-army-doc-helicopter-rescuer-as-new-ceo/), got her stricken son — who was previously undiagnosed — into the car and began driving to the medical facility after he had awoke in the night crying in agony without “a single symptom of anything.”

Jack suddenly lost all of his air halfway into the 10-minute drive, forcing his mom to make to an impossible choice: pull over to give him CPR or keep rushing to Huntington Hospital

Carlin decided to continue to the ER, knowing immediate resuscitation wouldn’t be enough, given Jack would need rapid intubation among other urgent procedures.

“I heard him slump over. I went to look back, and God said, ‘Maria, don’t look back. You made your decision. You’re not going to be able to handle seeing him right now,’ ” she recalled, fighting back tears.

Originally was supposed to be held at 8th Day Distillery but they are closed this evening. (Hours were recently updated) 

Location & Time: 600 E Ohio St Suite B, Indianapolis, IN 46202 @ 6pm-7:15pm

Agenda: Since this is the first meeting, we will primarily just be doing introductions on ourselves and our fiction pieces, with a bit of an introduction (group discussion) on the ideal agenda, what each of us is looking to get out of this group. That sort of thing. 

I am excited to meet you all, I got some good feedback on the original post about 3 weeks ago, so I am hoping to meet fellow fiction writers here in Indy.
