* **Herman Melville** 

  


'You must attend, Mr John.' 

'Is it really worth my time?' 

'Please, this man is an expert on literature, and he only comes to Thailand once every five years,' my boss continued. 

She was a diminutive Thai lady with an ancestral name matching various street signs around Chiang Mai's old city. 

The school was an offshoot of the American embassy, a relic from when the Vietnam War raged and Thailand threatened to fall to communism. Those people with implausibly long, regal names had taken American money to win hearts and minds. 

I trudged from her teak-adorned office down the narrow back stairs into the vast library that housed every important American work of fiction and nonfiction until 2009, when, in the wake of the financial crisis, the tap had finally run dry.

Thailand was an unforgiving place with a hangover. The lager was cheap– both in its production and price– and the humid jungle air wrung you of moisture. 

At the auditorium's door, various dignitaries awaited the arrival of the *learned scholar*.

There was a table of flowers outside the main hall, Chiang Mai orchids, and a giant poster of the man of the hour. Alan Weinstein D.LITT. He was oddly familiar; the only thing that kept me from fully recognising him was the low resolution of his portrait. Someone had enlarged a thumbnail 100x. 

Thailand had the overall appearance of a functioning place, but the closer you looked, the more the cracks showed, like the posters that looked more like mosaics or cups placed strategically around classrooms to catch drops from the leaky roof. 

My colleagues waited inside, along with a collection of advanced students who'd all been press-ganged into attendance by the boss. 

The land of smiles had a way of hoovering up lost and feckless teachers. There was French Sara, who was frequently reprimanded for smoking in class, and a bald Canadian fella with the same glib, superficial charm as Ted Bundy. He forgot to sign out of his account one day, and I looked at his search history, which, among other things, included 'legal age of consent in Thailand.' 

The only lad worth speaking to was a Yorkshireman called Carl, who readily admitted all he did in class was play Werewolf with his students, but regardless, he was good craic, and on nights off, we'd wander the city, stopping for a pint here and there.

'You got the talk from Ms Rachadamnoen,' he said, yawning. 'Aye, and you?' 

'You think I'd be here at nine in the morning if I hadn't?'

It's funny how our priorities change over time. In truth, I probably wouldn't have minded when I was 25; I would've seen such an exercise as playing the game, but I'd just turned 32, and it had lit a fire under me. 

I was going to be a writer. 

The aforementioned doctor of literature was led in by the board, and the students stood up to *wai.* 

The doctor took the stage and awkwardly wai'd back. He was about 55 years old, dressed formally, but the buttons on his pinstripe shirt were dangerously close to pinging off– one more Pad Thai could do it. 

He wiped his sweat-mottled forehead with his sleeve.

'Jesus,' Carl whispered, 'he's more hungover than us.'

He loaded up PowerPoint, complete with 2006 graphics. 

After a painful explanation of his credentials, we came onto the second page, which read **'Moby Dick- the great American novel?'** 

**'Today we're going to reexamine Moby Dick through a critical lens. Melville's great novel has often been viewed as an allegory for revenge and man's perpetual battle against the forces of nature.'** 

**'But what scholars have not taken into account is Moby Dick as one of the great queer novels of all time.'** 

It had been a few years since I'd read Moby Dick, and I scanned my memory for any gay or lesbian characters. 

**'The first thing to say about Moby Dick is that there is a lack of female characters and an overfocus on masculinity.’** 

But how could you write a book about 19th-century whaling and include female characters? Only men were stupid enough to sign up for an around-the-world whaling voyage. 

**'However, we do find an undercurrent of homoerotic feeling between our male characters.'** 

He continued on through the slides. 

**'You see here on the screen the scene when Queequeg and Ishmael share a bed; we find the following illuminating passage. “He pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me around the waist, and said that henceforth we were married.”** 

The doctor took off his suit jacket with a flourish. I glanced over my shoulder. The press-ganged students bore all the hallmarks of Insta withdrawal. 

The board of directors nodded along politely. Yet another wrinkle of irony was that not one spoke a lick of English. 

The presentation went on interminably with Melville's subtle nods to queer perspectives, and I zoned out. 

Some of my favourite writers were gay: Gore Vidal, Christopher Isherwood, Somerset Maugham, but was that really the most salient interpretation and central power of Moby Dick? 

**'I leave you with this,'** he said in conclusion, **'the story of Moby Dick is Ishmael trying to find meaning in his life and finding it in the tattooed arms of Queequeg.'** 

Customary applause followed, and we filed out of the auditorium. 

'What do you think?' I nudged Carl. 

'Bullshit.' 

Ms Rachadamnoen was waiting for us in the courtyard. She collected the teachers who hadn't managed to escape and corralled us into the staff room, where a spread had been laid on. 

We were joined by the doctor of literature, who put his arm around my boss. 

'How long is it we go back?' 

She wriggled, dwarfed by the vast American. 

'Oh, I think you first came here in 1995.' 

'Wow, doesn't time fly?' 

Again, I couldn’t shake the feeling I'd seen him somewhere before. 

I whispered to Carl. 'I know that bloke.' 

He continued stuffing his face with a spring roll before answering. 'You don't remember?' 

'Remember what?' 

'We saw him last night at Sheryles.' 

And it came back to me through the alcohol haze. 

Carl and I had a running joke where we'd eavesdrop on old white men with their young Thai girls and predict the next topic of conversation. It always followed a ten-topic framework we pulled out of the pre-intermediate English book. 

'He was chapter 2,' Carl replied, 'Weather, and then chapter 4 Events and Celebrations.' 

'You're right,' I said, 'they were talking about Songkran.'

The doctor could've drawn the complete meaning of life out of Moby Dick, but did it really matter when he spent his evenings with 21-year-old Thai prostitutes?

Carl and I let him hobnob with the other teachers, and I think that pissed him off because he addressed us directly. 

'I think you English guys will like my latest work--' he looked at us—'It's called *patriarchy and the pub quiz*.' 

Something inside me broke. Perhaps it was the hangover, the smell of fish sauce, or maybe I simply could not stand any more nonsense in my life. 

'Please, fuck clean off.' 

The entire teacher's room turned to face me, rice crackers frozen at mouths. 

'Excuse me?' 

'Fuck clean off.' 

I stood up and walked past the shocked onlookers. Even Carl was frozen in place. I only hesitated when I came to Ms Rachadamnoen, to whom I mouthed sorry, then I was out into the warm, free air of a Chiang Mai late morning. 

A phrase circulated in my mind as I walked through the school gates. *People are not exceptional.*

I didn’t have the answers to anything remotely approximating the big questions in life. I was lost, and I wrote to find those answers. I took it so personally because I needed exceptional people to make it all make sense.

Opposite the school was Wat Phan. 

The temples in Thailand were more than just places of worship; they were community hubs. On the grounds, people set up coffee and food stalls, and there were benches where you could sit and take in the tranquillity. 

The Buddhist monks padded around, tending the gardens and sweeping the pathways. 

I went inside and mulled over in my head the ramifications of telling that bloke to fuck clean off. 

Would I get fired? Probably not, and even if I did, the school wasn't long for this world.

An insane thought crashed through my head. I could become a monk. All of life's complexities would fall away when you gave yourself up to one unifying principle- nothingness- escaping samsara. 

I stood from my cross-legged pose on the temple floor and left the monks in the cool environs of their silent devotion. 

Of course, I'd never be a Buddhist; it was not in me to give everything up to dogma. But I respected those monks. Everything was going to shit because of hyper-capitalism, and there they were with their ancient and simple way of living. 

I exited the temple grounds and felt the hangover sink its claws in even deeper. My body craved salt, and I reached the 7/11 at the bottom of the road. 

It pained me every time I went in– this multinational corporation with a store on every street corner, closing down places run by old ladies in their pyjamas– but they did a hell of a cheese and ham toastie. 

I never saw such a depressed collection of people as those who worked in Thai 7/11 stores. The air conditioner was always turned down too low, the music was always too loud, and the halogen bulbs were a little too bright. 

It was a smash-and-grab job with my toastie. In and out and find a cafe to write; however, the queue was held up by the most unlikely of sources– an old monk…

He was holding something in his hand, poking out through the sleeve of a bright orange robe. 

It was a toastie, a cheese toastie, and that was the first surprise because I'd been led to believe that to be a monk meant you begged for alms every morning at 6 am. 

More Thai people filtered into the shop, and when they saw the monk, they lowered their heads. 

He did not acknowledge the devoted; instead, he continued wagging his finger at the young Thai girl behind the counter with gooseflesh arms and a daft cap branded with the 7/11 logo. 

He kept repeating the same phrase and gesturing at the toastie with a single bite out of it. 

I knew that phrase even with my limited Thai. 

‘Too cold.’ 

And she'd put it back in the little toastie machine for 30 seconds, and once again, with increasing ferocity, he'd say, 'Too cold.' 

It simply would not compute. An aggressive monk, a monk being aggressive in the face of a spotty teenager, an irate monk clutching a cheese toastie. 

The girl in her apathy was closer to serenity than the monk in his apoplexy. 

Again, that phrase: *people are not exceptional*, and often, the ones who have the remit to be exceptional are the exact opposite. 

Most people are lying, self-deluded, or just full of shit. 

I couldn't watch the spectacle unfold any further, so I returned my meal to the fridge. I'd write on an empty stomach. 

I left the 7/11 and found a coffee shop around the corner, and that sense of hopelessness was suddenly replaced by meaning because when I began to write, these were the words that came out. 

'There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life...'

1ozce8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1ozce8y/i_got_caught_talking_to_myself_in_public_and_i/,I got caught talking to myself in public and I still think about it,"So apparently I have developed a habit of talking to myself out loud and I did not realize how bad it got until last week.

I live alone and I work from home most days. Over time I started narrating what I am doing. At first it was small stuff like ""ok, laptop goes here, coffee goes there"". Then it slowly turned into full conversations. I would cook and say things like ""no, we are not ordering takeout again, future me will be proud of this pasta"". It felt harmless because, you know, nobody is there and the walls are thick.

Last week I went to the store that is five minutes from my apartment. I had headphones in but no music on, because my phone call had just ended. I am walking down the street, running through my mental to do list, and without really noticing I start saying it out loud. Stuff like ""after this I need to answer Karen, then send that file, then do laundry, no, laundry first, or I will forget again"".

I was in my own little bubble until I heard someone laugh behind me.

I turn around and there is this guy, maybe my age, walking his dog right behind me. He realizes I heard him and goes ""oh sorry, I just thought you were on the phone until you started arguing with yourself about laundry"". I wanted the sidewalk to swallow me. I mumbled something like ""yeah, long day"" and speed walked into the store.

The worst part is that now I keep replaying the last few weeks in my head and wondering how many times this has already happened and I just did not notice. How many strangers have watched me passionately negotiate with myself about buying chips. How many neighbors heard me in the hallway giving a pep talk like ""we are going to send this email and it is not going to be weird"".

Since then I have been hyper aware of it. I keep catching myself starting to whisper in public and then switching it into a fake cough. At home I am trying to tone it down but honestly it is hard, my brain likes having outside audio apparently.

So I am curious. Do other people do this or have I crossed some invisible line from ""quirky"" into ""ok, maybe chill"". Do you talk to yourself out loud when you are alone, and have you ever been caught in a really embarrassing way by a stranger or a friend?

1ozccr3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozccr3,Disappointing experience here on CMB (matched with 2 real persons + 3 scammers) over past 4 months on Premium + Advice for Improving my Profile,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I have been on CMB for a couple months on Premium and I have mixed feelings about this platform for making real connections. 

I matched with 2 real persons (one of which unmatched me after finding my conversation boring (we only talked about school)) and the other girl just ghosted my messages after chatting a bit. The rest of my chats in expired conversations are with scammers and CMB staff personally emailed me about investigating their accounts and have taken them down. I kinda wasted flowers on fake profiles and before then, I didn't know how to spot fake accounts. 

Here are some pointers about fake profiles:

\- Their pics are too good to be true. Looks like some IG models in exotic locations or even at a nice coffee shop. Some pics might be blurry too. 

\- \*\*\* I noticed that among the fake profiles I visited had NO DATA on their Activity Report. This could probably indicate a New User but I'm not sure if leaving chats counts as activity or if they just deleted their account and then recreated another new account with the same profile information to target their next victim. Real accounts always leave some data unless they are brand new users. 

\- They will quickly add you on WhatsApp then immediately leave the chat (you will see expired conversation on CMB on your end). Usually, real ppl never exchange numbers on the first day. 

\- Then they will mention something about cryptocurrency and eventually extort money from you. (I didn't fall for this, so I immediately blocked her WA) 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The discover page feels like it's recycling the same profiles sometimes even on Premium. Like if you set the age filter on the discover tab, it will not show you a lot of new profiles all at once. You will have to come back to this tab every other day to see if it will show you new profiles. I get it. It's CMB's business model to keep you using the app. 

I did receive flowers from ppl around my age (mid 20s) and mostly got likes from girls 5-7 years older than me (mid 30s). I don't even know how my preferences would affect who can see me. I guess they don't change who can view my profile. 

  
Besides the doom and gloom, I do enjoy small talk with scammers -- that way I feel slightly less lonely. I sound like I'm on copium but the online data scene just has too much drama.

1ozca6y,https://i.redd.it/ii91bizuhs1g1.jpeg,Got sick. Reported via MyWalmart. Earned myself 1.5 points. Is that the norm?,"So I’ve been grinding at good ol’ Wally World for a bit now as a Digital TA (picking, staging, dispensing, praying {to Krampus. X-Mas is soon!}
I’ve done management before, and I’ve always lived by:
• Early = on time
• On time = late
• Late = don’t come back

Punctuality is basically my Roman Empire. Time is money and shift changes run smoother when people aren’t strolling in like it’s a brunch reservation.

Anyway, last week I got wrecked by whatever plague is going around. (My wife is a pre-k, special needs teacher. I know those little  crumb snatchers are always sick and full o boogers. I almost never call off. I think I’ve done it maybe 3 times in my entire adult life. One of those times was COVID and I legit thought I was dying. Paid bills early, planned for the dogs, clean underwear, the whole dramatic “this is it” routine.

Point is: I only call off when I’m basically knocking on Krampus’ loading dock.

Fast forward to last week. Five hours before my shift, I hop on MyWalmart, report the absence, hit my inhaler like a Victorian orphan, blew whatever was in my nose into my sock, (or Kleenex) then collapsed on the couch.

When I wake up, I do that sick-person time warp math: What day is it? Did I sleep for 3 hours or 3 weeks?
Grab my phone… open MyWalmart… and boom: 1.5 points.

I’m sitting there flabbergasted, confused, annoyed, and kinda offended. I followed the rules. Orientation drilled it into us, right between the snacks and soda. So why am I getting slapped with points for a legit absence?

My TL is great, super approachable, always working their tail off… which is exactly why I feel guilty asking them anything. They’re juggling picking, staging, dispensing, coaching, teleporting between departments, etc. I don’t want to be “that associate.”

But I also don’t want to ignore this, go behind their back, or accidentally dry snitch. I just want to understand what the points are for and what I can do to fix it. If I messed up, fine. Teach me. I’ll take it on the chin and never repeat it. (Pfft.)

So here I am asking Reddit before I spiral for no reason. (I’m aware I’m already there) 
How do I handle this the right way? Do I talk to my TL? Ask a coach? Email the new CEO? Leave a note? Bring coffee and donuts like a peace offering? They don’t check messages, and it’s impossible to talk when both of us are Mario Kart’ing around the store helping customers who somehow can’t see the item literally in front of their face.

Anyway, thanks for surviving my second Walmart memoir. I’m a little manic today so the words got away from me, but I feel better typing it out.

Just looking for advice from anyone who’s been in management or knows the attendance system better than the cryptic little red points of doom.",4,1763373197.0,WalmartEmployees,3,1.0,False

So, I was thinking:  What did Lily, James (and possibly Sirius) do in their several months hiding from LV & Co.? What was the plan? Surely, they didn’t spend all that time basically chortling over pranking the bad guys by using Harry’s own godfather — his Failsafe in case the Potter parents didn’t make it out alive,m — as bait. They were both known as highly intelligent, creative people, both with tempers, who joined a vigilante/resistance group and were skilled enough to defy Voldemort himself three separate times. I just can’t see James as the type whose big plan was “Lily, take Harry & run; I’ll hold him off!” — with his wand on the coffee table. Not even a single prank on the doorway or path to the house. And was Lily really the type to do nothing more than beg an evil dark lord for a barter & trade while never once raising her wand or gun or flame thrower?

So, what kind of plan, protection, alliance, prank or scheme would you have them design and execute for the safety of their son and each other and, ultimately, the Wizarding World? (Feel free to have them know full well that Peter is a traitor.)

I can think of so very many, but for now I’ll offer this:  the one where “James” is actually a polyjuiced Peter who is Imperiused into acting like James. The real James is wearing his invisibility cloak (after bloody reaming Albus for even daring to try to borrow such a revered family heirloom that is obviously a crucial part of protecting the Potter family) and standing in the nursery with a loaded and completely muggle, fully automatic handgun. 

The half of the nursery in front of the doorway is a magical trap set to freeze anyone entering who is holding a wand. As soon as “Lily” (polyjuiced Sirius) carries “Harry” (glamoured Flitwick) into the room, Flitwick takes out his casting rapier and Sirius turns into his animagus form. Voldie enters the room, freezes, and has to watch unmoving as the Potter baby uses his magic rapier to summon everything from LV including portkeys, second wands and outer clothing, leaving him standing frozen in his “I ❤️Bellatrix” thong watching Sirius the Grim lift his leg and piss on LV’s gnarly, hooker-red toenails. Then James says something suitably witty about helping LV shed his evil ways and  turning “Hole-y” and opens fire on the horrified — and suddenly perforated — Dark Lord.   Nobody in the house registered the way James’s body downstairs suddenly twitched and his form seemed to melt an into a rat, which promptly scurried away, hoping he’d have better luck than his Master did. 

Outside in the yard, Wolfy-Remus finishes his impromptu surgery on Peter, casually flicking the minuscule twig & berries into a blazing Jack-o-lantern before transfiguring Peter into his Wormtail form (they had to keep Peter human for the traitor’s tiny junk to be visible enough to cut off; not even a werewolf would be able to see well enough to do the surgery to Wormtail) and tossing the shocky rat like a tennis ball to land dead center between Minerva’s cat form, Lily’s familiar Crookshanks, and Severus’s animagus form of a black mamba. 

After calling his wife Alice to tell her, Lily, and Augusta that the plan worked perfectly, Auror Frank Longbottom and his boss Auror-Captain Alastor Moody move in to bag the perforated former-Dark Lord. From the nursery windowsill a  weird-ass beetle flies down to the grass and transforms into Moody’s fourth ex-wife’s daughter Rita, who quickly writes down some quotes that she is certain are exactly what the hit team would have said if asked, and left to write her next award-winning story. She paused briefly before abruptly changing direction and heading to the Ministry for a sudden press conference.  And in a castle in Scotland, an old man lowered the twinkle factor in his cold blue eyes and straightened the seams on his electric-blue fishnet stockings as he prepared to go to the Ministry and break the the sad news that the Potters were dead, their baby survived but was in Albus’s protective custody, and Sirius was a betraying, traitorous traitor. 

Half an hour later, Albus Dumbledore, Minister Bagnold, and  Director of the DMLE  Barty Crouch hosted the press conference that would end all three careers, explaining to the narrow-eyed press all about You-Know-Who’s death, Sirius’s Black’s betrayal of the Potters, the disappearance and suspected murder of heroic Peter Pettigrew by none other than Sirius Black, etc., oblivious to the line of people behind them of the Potter Family with Sirius Black, the Longbottom Family, Professors McGonogall, Snape and Flitwick , and Auror Captain Moody — who had his bad foot resting atop the body bag at his feet — and one flat faced half-kneazle sitting in front of a mostly-dead rat, imitating Moody’s pose with one paw resting on the tearfully-squeaking mouse.

1ozc8pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/oxford/comments/1ozc8pf/my_weekend_in_oxford_a_review/,My weekend in Oxford: A review,"I wanted to get out of London for my birthday, so the GF and I booked a trip to Oxford for this weekend just gone.

I thought I'd share my findings to see if any of them resonate.

But first things first - overall we loved it and we'd be back in a flash.


Driving in from London was really straightforward, a straight dash along the M40.
Having done some research in advance, I was terrified of the congestion zone - it looked utterly incomprehensible to me, even the colour coded version which someone on this sub made. Is it a straightforward thing for residents?


Luckily, we were staying at Marlborough House Hotel (very nice) which was north of the city by Squitchey Lane (incredible name, btw) and it was an easy bus ride into town.

In town, we visited:

The outdoor market for food - got DanDan Noodles and braised lettuce from one of the stalls (Pychans Kitchen on my Monzo), absolutely superb. I'd go back there to try everything they had. Looking around, I got the sense there was some really good chinese food to be had in Oxford.

We popped in on Thirsty Meeples, the gaming cafe. We didn't stick around but we'd love to return, it had a really nice vibe.

The Pitt Rivers Museum. Long story short, one of the best museums I've ever visited. I'm already planning a daytrip from London to pore over every single exhibit.

Victorian market for some mulled wine and Irish coffee. As with most places, 'Victorian Market' means 'normal market with vendors wearing steam punk fancy dress'

We then went on a hunt for a good cocktail. We made it over to The Alchemist, but quickly realised it wasn't what we were looking for - the hen do spilling out as we arrived suggested it wasn't the place for a quiet martini. We ended up at The Ivy. It was perfectly serviceable and made for some interesting people watching. But if anyone has any recommendations for a quiet spot with good cocktails, I'm all ears.


Dinner

We had tried to reserve a table at the Chester Arms for their steak platter a couple of weeks ago, but they were already fully
booked. They suggested trying a walk-in, which we did at about 17.45pm. They were already full even then and the chap seating suggested we could wait but it would likely be an hour. Tbh, we would have happily waited at the bar, but there's no seating, not even a bar stool, so if you want to wait, you have to stand. It seems peculiar that a pub doesn't have any seating for non-diners, but I guess if they have reservations coming out of their ears, they don't need it?

So plan B meant we walked round the corner to the Magdalen Arms and we're so glad we did. We got seats easily, there was a good selection of drinks and the food was outstanding. We shared a slow cooked lamb neck with buttered greens and dauphinoise potatoes. Absolutely 5* and we couldn't imagine enjoying a steak platter more than that (no shade).


Sunday

Full English breakfast at Spires cafe which totally hit the spot followed by an alumni walking tour. Saga, a Swedish history grad, took us around the city, Trinity College, Weston Library and lots more. She was excellent and informative and the tour was well worth it in our opinion.

Then we had enough time to grab some pastries from the covered market and buy a book from Blackwell's before hitting the road and sloping off back to London.


The elephants in the room:


The buses. These seem like some kind of Faustian pact. They're clean, have lovely comfortable seats, appear to be pretty regular and the drivers are friendly. But why did I need to take out a second mortgage to travel 4 stops? Why do you need to state your destination at all, instead of just paying a flat rate? Loading up a full bus of passengers takes 20 minutes because half of them need to have a conversation with the driver first about where they're headed. And then, when you get upstairs, if you're over 5'8"" you have to stoop not to bang your head on the ceiling?!


Oxford is a phone signal black hole. It's pretty amazing that a student population and tourist hub has such abominable reception that you need to swing from shop to cafe to museum just to load your map and get around. Does it bug residents or is it just a fact of life?




In summary, we absolutely loved Oxford and could imagine living there.

It's beautiful, friendly and endlessly interesting. We'll be back in the summer.",5,1763373033.0,oxford,11,0.73,False

1ozc7lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ozc7lp/ive_been_on_dates_with_over_50_different_women_in/,I’ve Been on Dates with Over 50 Different Women in the Past 6 Months Using Dating Apps — Here’s What I Learned,"About me: I’m 32M who got out of a 7-year relationship about a year ago. After a lot of reflection, therapy, and honestly some painful unraveling of who I thought I “should” be vs. who I actually am, I realized monogamy wasn’t for me. I shifted toward ENM, not because of a lack of commitment, not because I wanted to “play the field,” but because it forced me to confront and let go of a lot of my attachment issues. Accepting that one person doesn’t need to be everything for me or vice versa helped me relax, breathe, and be more present with people and actually have much better relationships.

Fast-forward and I’ve gone on dates with over 50 women using the apps. Here’s what I learned that I wish someone had told me earlier…the honest stuff that actually matters.

Note: I am openly non monogamous. I have not dated anyone without them knowing this about me first.

1. If you want matches, you have to pay to play

It sucks. It shouldn’t be this way. But this is the reality of modern dating apps.

Paid boosts, premium visibility, expanded filters…these things give you significantly more opportunities to match with compatible people. You can have the most emotionally mature soul on earth, but if your profile isn’t being shown, none of it matters.

View it like marketing: you’re not paying for love, you’re paying for visibility.

2. Optimize your profile and photos (you already know this)

I won’t ramble on this because everyone already knows the basics. Good photos, a coherent prompt or two, no group photo Guess-Who sessions, and a little personality.

If your profile doesn’t show who you are, paying won’t fix it.

3. Choose apps that match your relationship goals

This is huge. If you’re ENM, monogamous but adventurous, open to casual, or looking for long-term—pick apps that align with that.

For me:

- Hinge was great for meeting emotionally available women looking for more connection, but also more of your “let’s text forever without plans” women.

- Feeld was ideal for ENM, non-traditional dating, and people who communicate clearly. Less women overall.

- Bumble was okay, but same problems as Hinge and way too expensive.

- Tinder just sucks. Maybe it’s still good for people in their early 20s, but not in your late 20s or early 30s+.

If you’re swimming in the wrong pond, don’t be shocked when you never catch the fish you want.

4. The MOST important rule: Do NOT text for days before meeting

This is the hill I will die on.

If you match with someone and spend more than 24 hours going back and forth without making plans, there is a 90% chance you will never meet. Even if you eventually do, the spark is gone or diluted. The mystery fades. You turn into pen pals.

Women will often say they’re cautious because there are creepy guys out there, and they’re 100% right. Their hesitancy is valid. But you can acknowledge that while still making it clear that you’re on the app to meet people in person.

Something like:

“I totally respect the need to feel safe and comfortable. I’m not here for pen pals though, would you like to grab a drink sometime this week? If not, no worries.”

You’re not being pushy. You’re being intentional. If their answer is no, respectfully tell them to reach back out when they are willing to make plans and move on.

5. Don’t overshare before the date

Texting is for logistics and light flirting, not biographies.

The more you reveal about yourself over text, the less exciting and dynamic you seem in person. You want your date to discover things about you face-to-face, not through paragraphs on an app.

Be interested, be kind, but stay mysterious in a confident, non-asshole way.

6. Don’t let your ego get destroyed by “bad” dates

This is where guys fuck up.

You go on a date, you think it went great, you’re imagining date two, maybe three… and then she ghosts or says she didn’t feel the vibe.

It is NOT a referendum on your worth.

Dating apps are not about finding “the one” …they’re about increasing your probability of connecting with someone compatible. It’s a numbers game, not a personal evaluation.

Sometimes YOU will feel nothing.
Sometimes SHE will feel nothing.
Sometimes both of you feel nothing.

If a date doesn’t lead to a second one, your job is to shrug, reflect briefly, and move on. Do not let it impact how you feel about yourself.

7. Stop doing coffee dates for first dates

This might be controversial, but hear me out:

Coffee feels like an interview.
It feels low-investment.
It signals “I’m not sure if I want to be romantic.”
And it leaves almost no room for chemistry.

If your goal is to generate romantic interest, not just vet someone, then coffee is the worst environment.

Better options:
- Grab a drink at cocktail bar.
- Get appetizers or dinner if neither of you drink.
- Do something where you can sit close enough to read each other’s energy and have a nice conversation.

A first date should feel like a date. Not a performance review or job interview.

8. Learn something from every single date

Even the “boring” or awkward ones have value.

Ask yourself:
- What did I say too much or too little of?
- Where was I tense?
- Did I talk over them?
- Did I ask questions that mattered?
- Was I present or just performing?

Dating is feedback. Use it.

But never put all your emotional investment into one person too early. You don’t know them yet. Keep perspective.

9. Embrace your masculine energy…with kindness

This doesn’t mean being domineering or overconfident. It means being kind and grounded.

Let her talk more.
Listen.
Hold eye contact.
Be attentive.
Be the calm in the room.

Most women don’t want a peacock, they want someone who can make them feel safe, heard, at ease, and like they can have fun!

Masculinity is about presence, kindness, and compassion. Treat each person with respect and like they are the most important person on the planet for the time you’re with them even if you don’t feel a vibe.

Final Thoughts

Dating apps can be draining, exhilarating, confusing, hilarious, and sometimes demoralizing. But if you approach them with clarity, boundaries, and intention, you can learn an unbelievable amount about yourself and what you want.

I’m still ENM, still dating, still meeting incredible women, and still learning something every week. But the biggest thing I’ve realized is this: dating isn’t about winning someone over, it’s about aligning with people who naturally match your energy and most importantly, having fun!

Shit feature: have feature where you have to shit, use toilet paper, at risk of colon rupturing. Can also get constipation but fixed with coffee (warning you can shit yourself)


Tetanus: driving Rusko or having a rusty satsuma and doing work on it gives a risk of you developing tetanus which can be remedied by a booster shot

Standing water: if you don’t turn over barrels when it rains, they’ll develop still water and breed mosquitos, which will be annoying or get you sick

I’m a solo dev from Monterrey, NL, with nothing but a laptop, Blender, Unity, and way too many YouTube tutorials. No team. No funding. Just a stubborn love for making games I’d want to play — and hoping someone else might love them too.

This is **Wicca Games**: one person, one promise — *I won’t leave you behind.*

I’m not here to drop a game and vanish. If I release something, I’ll update it. If you say “this doesn’t work,” I’ll fix it. If you suggest something wild — a cave that sings, a coffee machine that summons ghosts — I’ll try it. Because games aren’t just code. They’re conversations. With you.

My first project? *Earthpoc: Memories* — a 2D game with 3D visuals, set in a quiet, strange little town in Texas (2025), where a recent science grad wakes up in a world that doesn’t quite make sense. There are caves to explore, resources to gather, recipes to unlock. It’s small. It’s rough. It’s mine. And it’s just the beginning.

But this won’t stop here.  
I want to make *so many* games. Whatever grabs me next — a surreal puzzle, a weird simulator, a story about talking cacti in a post-apocalyptic laundromat. If it excites me, I’ll build it. And if you play it, I’ll make it better *with* you.

When — and if — I make any money from this, my first hire won’t be for polish or marketing. It’ll be for *ideas*. Someone to sit with me, laugh at dumb concepts, and help turn this lonely project into something we built together.

I’m starting from zero. I don’t know if this will work.  
But I know if I don’t try, I’ll always wonder.

If you believe in small studios that stick around… give this a upvote.  
If you have a wild game idea — drop it below. I’m listening.  
And if you want to watch a game grow, piece by piece, from a single line of code… follow along.

Let’s make something weird. And beautiful. Together.

In autumn I enjoy feeling the earth underneath my feet as it slowly turns towards winter.

I also like to add a little spooky vibes into my day playing games like Alan wake 2. One second I'm cozy solving a puzzle In game and the next I'm flying up shrieking from a jump scare and pouring coffee all over the place (yes this happened! 🙈)

But honestly? That perfect mix of cozy vibes & tiny heart attacks is what makes it amazing. Here’s to autumn nights full of laughs, jump scares, and just a sprinkle of nightmare fuel. 🎃✨

1ozbzcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ozbzcb/webfx_remote_job_review_toxic_isolating_and/,"WebFX Remote Job Review: Toxic, Isolating, and Shockingly Low Pay for African Workers","I feel like people need to hear the real side of working remotely for WebFX — especially if you’re based in Africa and looking at their “global” roles. This wasn’t remote work. This was digital slavery with a desktop computer.

I joined from South Africa thinking it would be a solid WFH opportunity. What I got instead was Working From Hell.

They send you two giant screens and a full desktop tower like it’s 2009, which sounds nice until you realize it’s basically their way of physically chaining you to your desk. You can’t work from a coffee shop, you can’t move around your flat, you can’t even shift to the dining room — you’re locked into one spot like an office plant with a keyboard.

Then the hours…
9 hours a day. No proper lunch break. No flexibility.
Just this constant “hurry up, hurry up, we’re tracking you” vibe.

And when I say tracked, I mean every single second. Idle time, cursor movement, how long you pee for — everything. It feels less like a job and more like being monitored by an ankle bracelet. They micromanage you into the ground.

And the pay?
I was making $1500 a month, not even close to US minimum wage, yet they expect US-level output, quality, and pressure. It honestly felt like they were exploiting the fact that I was African. The attitude was very much:
“We can pay you scraps because you should be grateful we even hired you.”

The way they speak to you often comes off condescending, like you’re automatically less capable because you’re based in Africa. The difference in tone between how US staff are treated vs. the African team? Wild.

There’s zero team culture, zero collaboration, zero humanity. No team events, no transparency, no effort at community. It’s just you, your giant screens, and a to-do list that never stops growing. Isolated. Overworked. Underpaid. And constantly watched.

I’ve had some tough jobs in my life, but this was the first one where I genuinely felt like my time, mental health, and dignity were disposable.

If you’re in Africa and looking at WebFX as a remote opportunity:

1ozbz79,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ozbz79/coworker_hangout_turned_really_uncomfortable_and/,Coworker hangout turned really uncomfortable and sexual. Not sure how to deal with seeing him at work now.,"I’m in my mid-20s and recently hung out with a significantly older male coworker who I’ve always gotten along with at work. He’s never flirted with me or acted weird, so when he invited me out for coffee for his birthday, I honestly thought it was just a friendly thing. He knows I’m in a serious relationship with my long-distance partner, I made sure to reference her when making plans just in case.

At first things were normal — talking about work, hobbies, movies, etc. But then the vibe shifted. He asked me a weirdly personal question about my sexuality, and when I told him I’m gay, he made a comment implying he had hoped I might be into men too and how he saw me switching to part-time was his opportunity. It made me uncomfortable, but I tried to brush it off in the moment because I didn’t want to cause tension.

It didn’t stop there. He started sharing a bunch of explicit stories about his past relationships and hookups — like very graphic details that I really didn’t need or want to know. He even mentioned he still has an old video of himself with an ex that he watches. I froze up. I wasn’t expecting any of this because he had never spoken to me like this before and I didn’t know how to react without making things more awkward or uncomfortable. I just wanted to leave and leave safely. He’s older and bigger and I was frightened. I tried to switch to different topics but it just kept coming back to that. I still am so unsure about whether it was on purpose or not, was he trying to convince me to change my mind with all his experience?

I stayed polite because I wanted to get through the night safely and without drama. When we left, he insisted on walking me to my car “for safety,” which honestly made me feel worse because he was the one making me feel unsafe. I was nervous and just wanted to leave, so I kind of defaulted to being my regular self but I wanted to throw up the entire time.

Once I got home, everything hit me. I felt gross, shaky, anxious, and honestly a little scared. I ended up having to work with him again recently, and my whole body tensed up when I saw him. He acted totally normal. I kept things short and neutral, but inside I felt sick and on edge.

I don’t want drama at work. I don’t want to escalate anything. I just want to feel safe and normal again. But I’m anxious every time I think about my next shift.

It’s just such a drastic change from the way I used to see him. He was so nice and friendly and I had no idea he was interested in me or that I was giving him any sort of idea that I was interested in him or that my relationship was open, which it isn’t. And it really messes me up thinking about how all he wanted was to sleep with me and wondering how long has he been thinking about me that way. I’ve had nightmares and I can’t sleep well anymore.

1ozbt0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/NordLayer_official/comments/1ozbt0g/remote_work_security_risks_why_your_couch_is_the/,Remote work security risks: why your couch is the new attack surface,"Working from home is pretty great. The commute is a 10-second walk. The dress code is whatever was clean-ish on the floor. You can attend a ""very important meeting"" while secretly petting your dog. It's a sweet gig.

But there’s a dark side of that freedom: the massive pile of remote work security risks we all pretend don't exist.

People like to romanticize remote work. The reality is often a frantic juggle of spotty Wi-Fi, distracting family members, and the ever-present temptation to see what’s new on Netflix. Attackers love this chaos.

**First, that “free” café Wi-Fi.** You know the one. ""Steves\_Cafe\_GUEST\_WIFI,"" password ""coffee123."" Using it for company business without a VPN is like having a loud phone call with your passwords in the middle of the café. Anyone nearby with the right tools can listen in.

**Second, your personal laptop.** Is the laptop you use for work the same one you use to download questionable game mods and click on ""10 Shocking Celebrity Secrets"" listicles? Personal devices are a minefield of potential malware. Mixing work and personal use on the same unmanaged laptop greatly increases the chance that a personal download ends up compromising work data.

**Finally, phishing gets sneakier.** At home, you're relaxed. That email from ""IT Support"" asking you to ""urgently verify your account"" seems a little more plausible when you're half-asleep and haven't had your coffee. Attackers know this and design their scams to hit you when you're most vulnerable.

So what do you actually do about all this? You just need a few steady habits.

1. **Use a business VPN.** Look, are we biased? Yes, obviously. But that doesn’t make it wrong. A VPN encrypts your connection and turns that sketchy café Wi-Fi into your own private, secure tunnel. It’s one of the simplest ways to protect your work traffic on untrusted networks. It doesn’t fix everything (you still need updates, MFA, and basic hygiene), but it closes a big, obvious hole.
2. **Give your work its own space.** If you can’t have a separate device for work, at least create a separate user profile on your computer and make sure that profile has auto-updates, full-disk encryption, and a strong password. Then keep your work browser, files, and apps as separate as possible from your personal stuff so a risky download is less likely to spill into work.
3. **Turn on multi-factor authentication.** Yes, it’s an extra step. It can be annoying. But it’s also one of the best ways to stop someone who stole your password from actually getting into your accounts. Think of it as a deadbolt for your digital life.
4. **Pair MFA with good passwords.** MFA works even better when you don’t reuse the same password everywhere. Use a password manager so you can keep everything long and unique instead of “CompanyName2025!” copy-pasted across your accounts.
5. **Keep your gear up to date.** Let your laptop, browser, and apps auto-update, and don’t ignore those restart prompts. Most attacks you hear about hit old, unpatched software, so staying current quietly removes a lot of easy wins for attackers.
6. **Lock down your home Wi-Fi.** Change the default router password, use WPA2 or WPA3, and update the router firmware once in a while. Your work laptop sits behind that box all day, so you want it doing more than blinking sadly in the corner.
7. **Develop healthy paranoia.** Be suspicious. That urgent request from your CEO at 2 a.m. for gift card numbers? Probably not real. Hover over links before you click them, and double-check unusual requests through another channel. If something feels off, stop and report it to IT or security instead of trying to handle it alone.

And if something goes wrong - you clicked, you downloaded, something’s weird - don’t quietly panic. Tell your IT or security team quickly. Early “oops, I clicked that” beats late “we think someone stole our data.”

The reason why I am reposting these tea package designs here because users in the 'Design' community claim the side areas of the tea package designs look like a 'penis'. That is why I removed the original post and reposting this in three discussions, so you guys can easily provide feedback on them.

Like I said, in my original post, I have designed this lemon balm tea packaging from a brief that requires packaging structures and surface graphics to be designed for each of the three tea packages. The brief also mentions that packages will contain 20 teabags in each of them, and they are meant to be a healthy alternative to coffee and drink beverages for women - aged 25 or over - who prioritise health and personal wellbeing.

So what do you guys think? What issues you notice in the lemon balm tea packaging that I have designed, including the suggestions to how I should improve on it?

I'll put links to the other tea package designs that I made, but you don't have to provide feedback to them if you do not want to. Take your time, guys.",1,1763371197.0,design_critiques,2,0.6,False

*August 11, 2020*

I’ve suspected things had been going on for a while, but kept brushing it off—I thought he would never do that to me. Since around April, he’s been refusing my attempts to have sex most of the time, sitting differently on the couch to where he’s facing away from me... little things.

It’s with one of our good friends. She came to my house a few weeks ago. She’s texted me. She’s pretended to be there for me.

I found out because I rolled over and they were having a Snapchat conversation. She said she wished she could be there to hold him and he summarized that I tried to seduce him last night and mocked it. I confronted him and he admitted it. He said that it was because quarantine was stressful. He does not want to work things out. He thinks of me “only as a friend in his heart.”

When I told her husband, he confronted her and apparently they actually kissed back in February. I think at that moment, I was never going to be enough for him.

We used to be so so so happy. The week before they kissed, we celebrated Valentine’s Day together. He bought us a nice bottle of wine for our anniversary. We had fun, we were perfect.

I don’t know where to go from here. We’ve been married only about a year. I feel like he took so much from me and doesn’t even want to go to therapy or work this out. I don’t want to leave my house but everywhere in it I see him. He chose her. I’ve been cheated in every relationship I’ve ever been in. He was supposed to be my forever.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve made therapy appointments but I was also laid off last month, so I have too much free time to analyze every single moment where he might have been lying to me or where I made myself pathetic trying to cling to him.

How do I start to get through this?

TLDR; My husband had an affair and does not want to try to work out our marriage. I feel like I’m drowning and don’t know how to start moving on.

*January 5, 2021, about 4 months later*

First of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who’s currently going through the same thing—IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better.

I had one conversation with my husband since everything happened—by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don’t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them.

While I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I’m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I’ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house. I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I’ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don’t feel guilty. It’s so refreshing.

I have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I’ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he’s made me feel. It’s definitely early and we’re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I’m a catch who doesn’t have to settle.

Therapy has done wonders and I’m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I’m proud of me. I’ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed—not me. I’m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything.

So all in all, life is good and there’s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can’t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I’ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more.

TLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.

*November 16, 2025, about 5 years later*

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story. When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years. Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy. But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health.

I haven’t been able to sleep since my best friend — which hurts the most — and her husband told us the baby name they’ve chosen. They’re 22 weeks pregnant.

We had them over for dinner last week. My husband asked about the name because they’ve been telling everyone else and we were the last to know. A few days before, I had actually told him, “I don’t know why, but I feel like they’re going to use X name.”

Well… that’s exactly what happened.

As soon as she said it, I told her, “That’s my baby name.” She immediately got defensive and claimed that my name was something totally different. But that name was only my choice if we had a girl. We have text messages going back years where she asked about my baby names and I told her my favorites. I even showed her the messages, and her response was, “How am I supposed to remember that? It was last year!” - we also talked about our favorite names during our walks and coffee dates, we even shared nicknames in the past 

When they were leaving, she said, “I’m sorry about this.” I told her, “I’m just going to leave it on your conscience — and on the text messages.” She stepped back and snapped, “How dare you say that to me while I’m pregnant?” and then left with her husband.

I know no one owns a name. But I honestly thought there was an unwritten friend rule about this. And only they and my family know how many years we struggled with infertility before finally getting pregnant, which makes this feel even heavier.

In January this year a GI diagnosed me with GERD (based on my symptoms) and prescribed PPI for a month. I took it and followed the diet as well. After 3 weeks I was great. Except one night I had a few sips of white wine and I felt a bit of burning in my stomach. She said that means I'm not healed, prescribed another month of PPI. She didn't tell me about the effects of stopping suddenly. After the second month ended, for a week my stomach felt like it was in flames. Then it was okay. I continued the diet until May and then slowly started reintroducing other foods, coffee, etc. 

Throughout summer I was okay ish, needing Gaviscon once in a while. Then, in October I started having reflux again and my stomach felt sensitive. One evening, I had some chicken soup, went to sleep later and woke up at 2AM with one of the worst stomach aches I've ever had. Since then, my stomach remained sensitive. I burp a lot. I feel bloated even after eating a bit. I started only eating a few things, mostly rice. 

I couldn't wait any longer and saw a GI this month. He said it's most likely a hiatal hernia (possibly combined with a loose LES) but I should have an endoscopy to confirm. He also said he can do the surgery. I asked if this can't be managed through lifestyle. He said no. He said surgery would be needed and I also need to stick to the diet for life. He prescribed PPIs for 2 weeks. 

I'm already a very anxious person dealing with other health problems. I have an appointment with another GI next month. I'll schedule an endoscopy with them. But in the meantime, I've been reading a lot of posts here, or in other subreddits related to gastritis, hiatal hernia etc. 

I'm trying to remain calm and wait until I have the endoscopy but I'm very stressed about the whole thing, the diet sucks, the bloating sucks, and I think I'm making it worse by stressing. I don't think about it all the time but when I don't, I stress about my other health issues. I am doing yoga, breathing exercises, trying to keep a good sleep schedule. What do you do?

I’m not usually one to make these kinds of posts, nor ones this long, but yours have helped me a lot, so I felt it was useful and fair to share my experience with those who have started the same path as me, or who are currently stuck or demotivated.

Yesterday, I received the results of my PMP exam, which I finally passed with Above Target, Above Target, Above Target.

I wanted to share a few things, as my journey was a bit different. I had failed three times before the exam change in 2021. I got discouraged and had given up.

This summer, I obtained the Green Belt, and some of the mindsets felt familiar to the PMP approach, so I decided to try again. I did a quick review to regain familiarity with the topics before immediately diving into quizzes.

I started again with my old Prepcast, which, I must say, was great before, but is much less useful now. Let me explain: it was an excellent tool for reviewing processes and methodologies. Every wrong answer prompted me to look up the topic, which helped me tremendously in getting back familiar with tools, terms, and processes. However, it is certainly very distant from today's exam, which requires a different set of skills to pass the test.

Suddenly, while participating in this group, I had a breakthrough with a resource: 200 Ultra Hard PMP Questions 1-200 on YouTube by Andrew Ramdayal. This triggered something in me regarding method: how to read the question, how to interpret it, how to reason. For example, if there is a problem with a team member, the answer is ""talk to him."" Your team are your experts, if they ask you to solve it, you must solve it—don't overthink. This was my true schooling on how to definitively enter the ""PMI thinking"" and how to pass the exam.

Afterward, I only took one full exam on PMI Study Hall, which I recommend to everyone because the questions are exactly in line with the real test. Towards the end, I also started following ""150 PMBOK 7"" by David McLachlan on YouTube, which are simpler but follow the same mindset.

**The Exam**

I took the exam at home, in my study. I found it very helpful to take a relaxing break to break the tension a bit. After every 60 questions, I went to the kitchen, had a coffee with my wife or a glass of water, exchanged a few words, and went back in.

Aside from a few *tricky* questions (which I managed to trace back to examples found in Andrew Ramdayal and PMI Study Hall), I found the exam to be of medium difficulty. The questions, compared to those in the quizzes, are shorter, mostly two lines long. There were 2 calculation questions, 4 multiple-response questions, 3 graphs, and 3 drag-and-drop questions. I think I managed my time well, always being able to review the flagged questions without anxiety or stress. When I finished, I was in a situation where I couldn't tell if I had passed or not. 50/50.

**One last piece of advice for the Dual Language option**

For those taking the exam in a dual language:

I usually looked at the question in my native language; if I was unsure, I re-read it in English, otherwise I answered in my language. On one specific question (where it was necessary to move an activity forward), where I was unsure, the answer differed:

* In English, it was: ""submit a change request to **reschedule** the activity"" (correct).
* In my language, it was: ""submit a change request to **anticipate** the activity"" (incorrect).

If I had to do it again, I would probably reread the question in English every time, just to be safe.",2,1763369864.0,pmp,2,1.0,False

He is a bit of a control freak and loves his little comforts (taking long mornings for coffee and a tv show before work, listening to music etc.) and always gets out of sorts when something gets in the way of his routine. His 14 years old cat has had all sort of problems for a year now (chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, pancreatitis, dementia, and so on) and every time she was in a crisis, he froze, which really scares me. Sometimes I managed to get her out of the crisis/give her the pills or helped him take her to the vet, but it has been a year and he still feels overwhelmed and either freezes, either has an angry fit if anything goes wrong (e.g. she pees outsite the litterbox, or he can't give her the pills etc.).

I try to always stay calm with both the cat and my boyfriend (I have an old cat of my own and totally understand how hard it must be, how much sadness and anticipated grief he must be feeling). However, this prolonged situation is starting to wear me down a little bit as well, and I feel very much alone in this. He used to be a very loving partner, listened and communicated with me, and we went on a lot of trips together, we used to go out quite often to concerts, movies, dinners, but this past year he seems to be leaving a lot of the emotional toll on me, while he retreats in his videogaming nights and gets upset when I try to say I miss him.

Last year (before the cat started to get sick) he stopped going to therapy because he genuinely felt better, but now refuses to go back even though I have gently tried to tell him he should seek professional help (since I have already tried some things to gently shift his perspective/make him a bit more resilient). It's really sad for me to see him like this and also very scary, because we have elderly parents as well and while they are healthy now, I know they won't always be like that -- and I want to know that he will be able to support me and not just freeze like he is doing now.

Does anyone have some advice on how to talk to him about all of these things?",1,1763369759.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1ozbe3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/1ozbe3z/my_journey_with_my_mom_that_has_alzheimers/,My journey with my mom that has Alzheimer's,"I often read through this subreddit and wanted to post in case others can relate or have any thoughts, since reading through others' posts on here has also helped me a lot.

My mom is 78 and I'm 41. She's stage 5, or even possibly early stage 6. I almost moved her in to assisted living, but they wanted her to have either a 24 hour caregiver, or be in memory care. This was due to potential wander risk noted by her doc. The former we can't afford, and the latter I didn't feel was quite right for her just yet. She also has always been so strong and independently-minded, and having her own space/independence was always important to her, due to having that controlled and taken away by a narcissistic and cruel mother. I think that makes moving her (when of course she doesn't want to or understand why she would need to) even more triggering for her.

The last few months have been some of the hardest. We had to take away her dog that she absolutely loved, her car (she mentions this still at least 1x daily), and I have recently hired her an in-home caregiver that I'm still not sure about -- I'm still seeing how she handles her coming in most days of the week. If I had framed her as a caregiver, my mom would have NOT accepted her help. Instead had to frame her kind of as a friend just helping out now and then.

I live 3 hours away and drive back and forth every week from my house to her house and stay with her for a week since I work from the computer. She also has a partner (he's more like a friend now) who comes to see her for a few hours most days. I do find the driving tiring, and it sometimes feels like it's putting a strain on my relationship since I live with my partner.

Just recently I've noticed more decline, where she spends a lot of time talking to a stuffed animal she has that she thinks is real. She's also mixing weird stuff with her food -- like salad dressing in her coffee, or hummus with her ice cream. And just in this last week, she's sometimes now up late into the night -- like 3am or later -- talking to her stuffed animal. More agitation and confusion at times as well.

I've spent countless hours trying to handle this all the right way. To make sure I come up with the best care for her and who she is, at the right times. I'm projecting she'll need memory care within 6 months, but it still feels so wrong somehow to put her there if she's still at all with it/herself. I'm hoping the decision will be somewhat easier when it becomes clear that she needs 24hr care. But a lot of the facilities have violations as reported on the state gov't website, so am looking into some of the larger adult care homes that provide memory care.

My mom and I have always been close, and to see her decline is absolutely brutal - it consistently makes me angry that she has to deal with this. She is THE kindest and most compassionate person I know. When she is totally gone mentally, I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle seeing her like that.",1,1763369654.0,Alzheimers,2,1.0,False
1ozbdz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ozbdz3/should_i_reach_out/,Should I reach out,"Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some outside perspective, because my mind is going in circles.

I (32M) dated a girl (34F) on and off for about 8 months. It was never officially a relationship, but it definitely felt like more than casual dating at times.

Here’s the timeline:

1. We started dating and had a great first 2–3 months. Good chemistry, lots of fun, but her feelings didn’t develop as fast as mine did. She told me things were moving too quickly, and she wasn’t ready for anything serious.

2. We stopped dating because the dynamic felt off.

3. Two months later, we randomly ran into each other at a festival. Everything clicked again, and we started seeing each other once more.

4. After about a month, the same issue came up: she wanted to take things super slow, no expectations, no commitments, and see if feelings might grow naturally over time. I became insecure about the unclear situation and told her I couldn’t do the “slow, undefined” thing.

5. We met up to end things. It was actually a warm and emotional goodbye — lots of laughing, hugging, even kissing. She said I could write her anytime, and she seemed sad about the situation. I told her I needed a no-contact break to move on, and that I’d remove her on IG/FB. She got emotional about that but accepted it.

6. A week or two later, I removed her. That was two months ago.

Since then:
I recently made my IG profile public again. The second I posted a story, she watched it.

She keeps watching my stories over the last week.

I just saw her pop up on Hinge, so I know she’s dating again.

I’m honestly torn.

I miss her. I’d like to see her again, and I would even consider dating her again if she was emotionally open this time. I’ve gone on dates and slept with other people since we ended things, but nothing serious.

I’m thinking about sending her a message like:

“Hey :) I biked past *a bar we used to visit* the other day and thought of you. Hope you’re doing well. If you’d like to catch up over a coffee sometime, that would be really nice.”

Here’s where I get stuck:
Is it a bad idea to reach out after I was the one who initiated no contact?

Does her watching my stories mean anything, or am I reading into it?

Is this just me being nostalgic and lonely, or does it sound like there might still be something worth exploring?

Would really appreciate any unbiased insight.
Thanks for reading 🙏

Let me start by saying I’m grateful to be alive, grateful to share this story, and tell off all you fucking nerdy dewbz trying to roast my Reddit page while rocking cosplay attire.. 
 

Life is a journey and it’s a gift we live in this day of age.. for ne anyways.. amongst many other things… much more.. but fuck gratitude list.. 

I’m 36, going 22.. I’ve been to more rehabs and detoxes than I count now.. and currently could probably use one. Though- I’m fully functioning working a full time job as a stylist.. and busy busy.. 

I left my apartment in Arlington to live in with my bf of 3/4 years… I went from DC metropolitan to WV/VA line… 
long story short..
My ex won 350k gambling and we’re already on rocky terms at that time.. 
okay so- July 2024 my engine blew due to my strategic decision to not change the oil after 8-9 months and traveling up and down the east coast.. chasing griz, if you know I mean.. 
now that I left the metro area for the boondocks I was without any transportation other than uber which no.. the space in between each location was wide spread and resulted in a long waiting game, awkward encounters and obviously money, right?
The first few months were all a pipe dream.. doing things on a pink cloud hand in hand.. and suddenly something within us just broke.. 

I would leave to go to my girlfriends house whenever I want. As you see now I’m a night owl so usually around this time EST; 3am. We would bicker and his idea of disassociating was to game for four five days at a time.. he played Rust till Rust could be played no more… 
Months down the road, I remember being outside the blackjack table close to the bar, PBR in hand just vibing it out at the casino..then came an incoming call, displayed as insensitive POS.. which it still reads today.. and much more accurate as the days pass.. 

He called to tell me he would pay me 500 to not affiliate with him for one week.. he had money coming in off a limbo slot or something.. anyways no coming back home, no contact, nothing.. one solid week.

So I gambled that 500 away with two new freshly abroad Turkish guys. The one who was most unattractive and yet most interested in me shared that they were building a home in Loudoun county and expanding his families pharmaceutical company to the states. 
The two of them had been in that states for about a month or four or so…  
Funny story… I had to keep giving him side bets as if they didn’t know how to play them.. idk if I was drunk, he was drunk, or maybe just caught up and oblivious , who knows but by the time of departure I got to know the pit boss and let the little information get out about the payoff of my absence.. so that casino was my exes stomping grounds as well as mine mine.. we were known as that couple.. I think but to some
So anyway

Left with Turkish guys to their home which is much further than I anticipated but I did it. Got there safely.. No- Didn’t get laid.. I’m not really like that.. they were respectful and we had some Turkish coffee and dates in the am.. which wasn’t really enjoyable as I anticipated the walk of shame to my car, which is parked far away on top of the hour and a half drive to get home.

I had no intention of leaving anyone alone esp one who is suggesting a cash advance in order to do so.. it’s a challenge at that point.. 

I had no idea the gravity of the amount that was won.. not that I needed to cause otherwise I would’ve negotiated a higher rate price and not seen any sensible reason to be in contact..

Finally got home, trashed the house, dumped glass and kitchen trash all over his bed. Left it just as is.. aside from the litter spread throughout.. even atop on his newly purchased suites, toilet water perfume, and dress shoes.
I even went as far as..
Flushing the deems cause I was making a point like a dumbass and then it was gone.. a good bit too. To never be seen Again.

Police were called a few time during this miserable chapter of my journey of a life.. I can’t remember every time but I didn’t get arrested, not at that time anyway.. one specific time was due to a parton of the bar I liked to frequent overheard my admission of events and I guess the old bar man contacted him with death threats while justifying the time spent in prison would be well worth it. 

That’s kinda ya whatever- you gotta understand though.. words do power but it goes hand in hand.. I don’t think the old man had any intention other than to prove a point in a maybe ill manner way but it is what it is..

To be continued if anyone even cares

Have we hit the COURTNEY LOVE scale

Nobody cared, not even a DM. Stupid, since I'm spending every spare minute typing fixes at 1am and my keyboard is basically sandpaper now.



Was literally squinting like a grandpa at my screen, jacked up on instant coffee, scrolling endless threads, trying to spot where anyone even talks about this stuff. The moment that made me almost laugh: I finally found a thread with folks complaining about a tiny bug, and the top reply? Already buried by three meme comments and a ""same here lol.""



Honestly, I used to just spray into big subreddits and hope for a miracle. But it's never signal first. If nobody replies, it's because the thread is too loud or wrong timing esp. for founders with less than zero clout.



Here’s what actually worked: I started searching for no-engagement threads, even if they were two days old, and wrote replies as if I was helping an old friend. Found one where nobody answered, I chimed in casual, sharing my own workaround (used draftr.ph in the convo because it literally fit). Mentioned how I dealt with the same mess while talking to folks building stuff like NotionFlow, GreenLedger, or ShipSprint. Got a few DMs; got a test user that week. Ran this same move about 40 times before it felt semi-repeatable, win wasn’t instant but the quality difference punched, kinda similar to when I tried it again inside threads from tiny teams behind WorkflowFox and CarbonEase.

1ozbcb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1ozbcb4/how_to_choose_smart_plugs_for_large_families/,How to choose smart plugs for large families?,"Look, I'll be straight with you - managing a large family's energy use can feel like herding cats. Between kids leaving lights on, multiple devices charging overnight, and that one TV everyone swears they turned off, the electricity bill adds up fast.

Smart plugs completely changed how I handle this chaos, and honestly, I wish I'd discovered them sooner.

**What Actually Makes a Smart Plug Worth It?**

First things first - not all smart plugs are created equal, especially when you've got multiple family members using them. Here's what I learned matters most:

**Scheduling features** are absolutely essential. I set our living room lamps to turn off automatically at 11 PM because my teenagers definitely won't remember. Game consoles power down at bedtime. The coffee maker starts before anyone's even awake. It's like having a responsible adult in every outlet.

**Energy monitoring** showed me which devices were secretly draining power. Turns out our old Xbox was using electricity 24/7 even when ""off."" Now it's on a smart plug that actually cuts power when not in use.

**Voice control compatibility** matters if you've already got Alexa or Google Home. My kids actually use voice commands to control their bedroom fans, which is way easier than arguing about the thermostat.

**Amp rating** is something I didn't think about initially. Large families mean more high-power devices - space heaters, hair dryers, microwaves. Make sure your smart plugs can handle at least 15 amps to avoid any safety issues.

**How Many Do You Actually Need?**

For a family of five or more, I'd recommend starting with at least 6-8 smart plugs. Focus on the biggest energy wasters first - entertainment centers, window AC units, space heaters, and those areas where lights constantly get left on.

You can always add more later once you see how much control and savings they provide.

**The Setup Really Isn't Complicated**

I'm not exactly tech-savvy, and I got ours working in maybe 20 minutes total. Most smart plugs just need your WiFi password and a free app. The harder part was deciding what to plug into them first.

**Group Controls Save Your Sanity**

This feature alone makes smart plugs worth it for bigger households. I created a ""Goodnight"" scene that shuts off everything downstairs with one command. A ""Movie Time"" setting dims certain lights and turns off noisy appliances. No more walking around the whole house checking outlets.

If you're ready to stop the energy waste and get some actual control over your home's power usage, check out [these smart plug options that work great for families](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). They've got different styles and features depending on what you need.

**Real Talk About Savings**

I'm not going to promise you'll save hundreds monthly - that's unrealistic. But between automatically powering down vampire devices and scheduling heavy-use items during off-peak hours, we've cut about 12-15% off our electric bill. For a large family, that actually adds up to real money over time.

Plus there's something satisfying about knowing the basement lights aren't burning electricity all night because someone forgot them again.

**Bottom Line**

Smart plugs aren't some fancy gadget you don't really need. For large families dealing with constant energy waste, they're honestly one of the most practical smart home additions you can make. Simple to use, affordable to start with, and they actually solve real problems.

You can browse [a solid selection here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) to see what fits your family's setup best. Start with a few, see the difference, then expand from there.

# Why Budapest is such a good first-timer city

Budapest hits a very sweet spot:

* Looks ridiculous at night along the Danube
* Has thermal baths that actually live up to the hype
* Still fairly kind on the wallet compared to Paris/Vienna
* Ruin bars and wine if you want nightlife, quiet Buda if you do not

For most people, **3 full days** is the sweet spot:

* 1 day for classic sights
* 1 day for Buda + baths
* 1 day for markets, cafes and ruin bars

# Quick facts

* Country: Hungary
* Currency: Hungarian forint (HUF)
* Best time: April–June, September–early November
* Airport: Budapest Ferenc Liszt (BUD)
* Typical first trip: 3–4 days
* Famous for: thermal baths, ruin bars, Danube views, huge Parliament building

# Where to stay (areas that actually make sense)

If it is your first time, this is the simple breakdown:

* **District V (Belváros):** Central, smart, very walkable, loads of sights and the river nearby
* **District VI (Terézváros):** Handy for Andrássy Avenue, culture, cafes and shops
* **District VII (Jewish Quarter):** Ruin bars, street art, nightlife, younger vibe, can be noisy
* **Castle District (Buda):** Cobblestones, views, quieter evenings, more “romantic break” energy
* **Around City Park:** Good for families and anyone who wants green space and calmer streets

**Tinker’s Tip:** Noise-sensitive? Stay near, not in, the noisiest bits of District VII or pick Buda instead. Your sleep will thank you. 😴

# Top 10 things to do in Budapest (for first-timers)

If you did nothing else and just ticked this list, you would still have a solid trip:

1. Walk the Danube promenade and see Parliament from both sides of the river
2. Explore Buda Castle and Fisherman’s Bastion at sunrise or sunset
3. Soak in **Széchenyi** or **Gellért** thermal baths
4. Have a drink in at least one ruin bar in the Jewish Quarter
5. Take a night-time Danube river cruise for the lit-up views
6. Ride a yellow tram along the riverfront
7. Visit St Stephen’s Basilica and go up to the viewing platform
8. Eat goulash and lángos at a market or local spot
9. Wander City Park and Heroes’ Square
10. Escape to **Margaret Island** for a slow wander or cycle

**Good to know:** Some of the best Parliament photos are from the opposite bank or a boat, not standing right next to it.

# Thermal baths basics (so you don’t do them wrong)

Budapest is built on thermal springs, so baths are a huge part of the whole experience.

* **Széchenyi:** The big yellow one with huge outdoor pools, very social, touristy but iconic
* **Gellért:** Indoor, tiled, pretty, nice on cold or rainy days
* **Rudas / Lukács:** More local feel at certain times, still very historic

Tips:

* Take flip flops, swimsuit, towel, water bottle
* Go early morning or later in the evening for fewer people
* Expect a couple of hours minimum if you want to properly rotate hot/warm/cold pools

**Tinker’s Tip:** Hydrate before and during. Being slightly hungover plus spending hours in hot water is not the power combo many people think it is. 💧

# Ruin bars, wine & nightlife

The ruin bar thing is real and worth a look, even if you are not usually a big “night out” person.

* **District VII** is the epicentre
* Bars are in old courtyards and buildings, full of random furniture and odd decor
* Beer is good value, Hungarian wine is underrated (Tokaj, Eger, Bikavér etc.)

If full-on clubs are not your style, go early evening for a chilled wander, then switch to a quieter wine bar later.

**Fact:** Many ruin bars have semi-outdoor areas, so in cooler months you will want a light jacket even if you are inside some of the time.

# What to eat (and what to expect)

Traditional Hungarian food is hearty and perfect for post-walk/post-bath hunger:

* Goulash soup
* Paprika-heavy stews
* Lángos (deep fried dough with toppings)
* Kürtőskalács (chimney cake) for your sweet tooth

Budapest is not stuck in one food era though. There are loads of:

* Modern bistros doing lighter takes on classics
* Solid coffee shops
* Vegetarian/vegan places in central districts

**Good to know:** Check for a service charge on your bill. If there is no service charge, tipping around 10–12% is the usual restaurant norm.

# Rough costs (per person, per day, excluding flights)

Very broad ballpark, just to feel the vibe:

* **Budget:** 20,000–30,000 HUF (about £45–£65 / €50–€75)
   * Hostel, public transport, cheap eats, one paid sight
* **Mid-range:** 35,000–55,000 HUF (about £80–£125 / €90–€140)
   * Decent hotel, baths, a couple of paid sights, sit-down dinners
* **Comfy:** 60,000 HUF+ (about £135+ / €150+)
   * Boutique hotel, taxis, spa extras, nicer restaurants

Big “surprise” costs for a lot of people: baths, alcohol-heavy nights and little taxis you did not plan for.

**Tinker’s Tip:** Decide a rough daily budget in HUF before you arrive, then keep a note in your phone. Way easier to stay on track. 💸

# Best time to go

* **Spring (Apr–Jun):** Comfortable temps, longer days, perfect for walking and cafes
* **Autumn (Sep–early Nov):** Cooler, golden light, usually fewer crowds
* **Summer:** Hot, busy, lively; good for late-night vibes, less great for midday steep hill walks
* **Winter:** Cold, Christmas markets and steaming baths under icy air

If this is your first visit and you have the choice, aim for spring or autumn, ideally midweek.

**Fact:** Outdoor bits of some baths and pools can close during very cold snaps or for maintenance, so it is worth checking details just before a winter trip.

# Safety & scams (the honest version)

In short: Budapest usually feels safe and relaxed for visitors, including solo travellers, but it is still a capital city.

* Normal pickpocket risk in crowds and on public transport
* Watch your drink in busy bars
* Use licensed taxis or ride apps, not random cars
* If a bar or “special deal” feels sketchy, leave and go elsewhere

**Good to know:** Transport inspectors do genuine spot checks. Validate your ticket and keep it handy. Fines are not cheap.

# Easy day trips

If you have more than 3 days:

* **Szentendre:** Cute riverside town, galleries, streets to wander
* **Visegrád / Esztergom:** Danube Bend, hilltop views, churches
* **Margaret Island:** Technically still in the city but great for a low-effort “escape” day

Good if you want one “slow day” in the middle of a busy city break.

**Tinker’s Tip:** Treat Margaret Island as a lazy half-day move if your energy is low but your brain wants green space.

# 3 day sample itinerary

**Day 1 – Pest & river**

* Parliament from the opposite bank
* Shoes on the Danube memorial
* St Stephen’s Basilica + rooftop
* Night river cruise

**Day 2 – Buda & baths**

* Chain Bridge, Castle Hill, Fisherman’s Bastion
* Wandering the Castle District
* Evening at Széchenyi or Gellért baths

**Day 3 – Markets & ruin bars**

* Central Market Hall
* Jewish Quarter, street art, cafes
* Ruin bar night, late snack

**Fact:** You can hit the major sights in 2 days if you move fast, but 3 days leaves space for naps, cafe loitering and random detours that usually end up as the best memories.

# Getting there (super quick version)

* **Airport:** BUD, 16 km from the centre
* **To the city:**
   * 100E airport bus into central Budapest

# Quick Q&As (good for fast planning)

**Is Budapest worth it for a first city break?**  
Yes. Baths, views, nightlife and price point all line up nicely.

**How many days do I need?**  
Three full days is ideal for a first trip.

**Is it walkable?**  
Central Pest and the riverfront are very walkable. Use trams/metro for hills and longer hops.

**Do I need cash?**  
Cards work almost everywhere, but some forints for markets and older bars are handy.

**Tap water safe?**  
Yes, tap water is safe to drink. Bring a refillable bottle.

We all heard it countless times and it is always the same.

My long story short is that I talked to someone 1 year ago and although no contact at all, I keep reminded about him.

Long story: Talked 3-4 months, never saw each other face to face and never did any haram. Alhamdulillah.

We were in different cities, I was far away, 6 hours of driving with car in one direction. Never managed to see each other.

Ok, we figured out it doesn’t work and we split.

I deleted him, blocked him and never spoke to each other again.

I had and have very bad time forgetting him.

I’ve spent my whole ramadan praying for reunite, searching for Laylatul Qadr and asking Allah for him on the day of Arafah. Not blindly, but also making it good and if it is not, please remove the feelings.

7 months ago it was so bad I was begging Allah for few hours to stop everything, I want to move on because this is not healthy and asked him to send me a man who is meant for me.

1 hour later I saw him in a grocery store, eye to eye (check my last post, it is very interesting), but I just walked passed, not even saying hi.

Now I’m thinking I’ve messed up my chance and thinking about it 7 months later.

Never saw him again.

I said ti myself again - Ok, this needs to stop, you should move on, you will be fine.

Alright, let’s go!

Few months later, my new friend (I moved to this new city remember) is looking actively for someone for me. She is married and her and her husband have great circles of good people.

She proposed some people and one day she mentioned him, saying he is a great guy here, everyone knows him, works hard, follows religion etc. She doesn’t know we ever talked.

I told her the story and she stopped mentioning him.

Ok, keep moving on.

Bear in mind, I’m not even stalking him, I want strict no contact because I wanna forget.

Few night ago I had a dream about him. He was very close to me and I could feel his presence, like it was real…

And then yesterday… I went with friends to another city for a football game. While we were  sitting in one coffee shop, I looked left and saw someone who looks EXACTLY like him. Like they are twins!

I didn’t know it will hurt me that. 

I asked one of the friends to tell me something about his features so I could tell if it is him and he was not. But before that she said he has a ring!

That hurt even more and my first thought was “I don’t wanna him to be married to someone else, but me, I need to pray tahajjud again and increase my duas”. 

Later when I passed by that man, I saw it is not him.

Whole night I was thinking about that and forgot the event and was alone in the company of thousands of people.

I’m still thinking about all of it.

He deactivated all his accounts. Saw it because I wanted to see if he got married (I thought maybe this is was Allah wanted to tell me with that ring and the guy I saw).

I prayed istikhara last night before sleep and I said - ok, this is not normal anymore, I need to know and I need a change of situation.

I asked Allah for a specific dream if he wants us together. I didn’t get that dream, don’t even remember what I dreamed of.

The ending line - I’m trying to move on and forget because that man is not in my life at all and I keep getting reminded of him which is setting me back.

The duas I’m making I don’t see any answer, I am just confused.

I keep telling myself that he maybe even got married and this need to stop and here I am, writing super long post about the things I never told anyone.

Please give me a good advice, I’m trying to tie my camel. I’m trying to do my part, I started and wanted to move on, but It doesn’t help to see him in the dreams, to see someone who looks the same as him, it doesn’t help when people recommend him…

Still, I am fully prepared to accept the asshole stamp, because I might have been a bit of an egoist.*

A few summers back, I went to stay with my grandmother for two weeks. Both my aunt and uncle also stayed for a week, my aunt the first and my uncle the second one.  
My uncle had his first child with him (I think she was around 2 back then? She still slept in a babypark) and came to wind down with his wife. They asked (decided really) to let her sleep in my room. Even though we had another empty bedroom. And there was enough place in theirs for the bed.  
Funny detail: before this I had never met my ~~niece~~ \*cousin and had not seen them for a few years (family dispute yadiyadiya). Of course I was \*elated\* to share my room with a baby that woke up around 5:30 am and had the energy of a small Duracell bunny.  No hate towards my ~~niece~~ \*cousin; she is a child and had not chosen any of this.

The first day I tried to accommodate them a bit and keep her busy since I saw that they were tired from the trip. I played with her, put up a babypool, took her to the local market where they thought I was a teenage mother, etc.  
My uncle and his wife appreciated it and had voiced this.  
The second day I was woken up at 6-ish with whining, I decided that after a day of babysitting, I wanted a calm morning to myself. Before my uncle arrived, I always went to the local bakery in the morning with the adjacent coffee shop where I read a magazine or stared at the locals while drinking a coffee and sneakily smoking a cigarette. Knowing that the next hours would be filled with screams, crying and cooing, I took my sweet time before returning with the pastries and bread.

Upon my return, my uncle and aunt were waiting for me. My uncle asked where I went and if I had not heard my ~~niece~~ \*cousin being awake. I responded that I had, but that I decided to go to the bakery alone.  
He asked me why I had not taken her with me because now ""her mother had to wake up and take care of her"". Teenager me (bless her) just stared at him with the viennoiseries dangling in my hand until the moment became too uncomfortable and my grandmother called me from inside. She said I could have relieved them a bit more, since they are young parents and it had only been a day. When I told her it had been a very intense day yesterday, my uncle overheard, laughed, and said ""that I underestimated it, and it is indeed something else"". The day after the next, I returned home. No further incidents happened, but I strategically kept my distance.

So, AITA?  
I understand that it might have been nicer and it was only day two, but at the same time I feel like they set it up in a way that I would be responsible for waking up with her every day even if it was only for four days. Friends are divided, only my dad is fully on 'my side'.  
My uncle 'jokingly' brought it up in a conversation where it was mentioned I am pregnant, as a study of my character.

I will establish a consistent 6 AM - 8 AM morning routine for 60 consecutive days including exercise, journaling, and focused work to maximize productivity.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Days 1-15: Wake at 6 AM daily (no snooze), 20-minute workout, cold shower, 10-minute journal, coffee, 60-minute deep work session.  
Days 16-30: Refine routine timing, add gratitude practice to journal, optimize breakfast prep, protect deep work time (no email/Slack).  
Days 31-45: Maintain consistency on weekends too, track productivity metrics (tasks completed), notice energy level improvements.  
Days 46-60: Perfect the system, document benefits, create backup plan for travel/disruptions, commit to 90-day extension.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Daily check-in photos — timestamped selfies at 6:05 AM showing wakeup time for all 60 days (can be compiled into video).
2. Workout app screenshots — Strava/Apple Fitness showing 60 morning workouts logged.
3. Journal entries — photos of handwritten journal (or digital screenshots) showing 60 daily entries.
4. Productivity tracker — spreadsheet showing deep work hours completed each morning (minimum 40 hours total over 60 days).
5. Weekly energy level ratings — self-assessment (1-10 scale) tracking increased energy and focus.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Oversleeping — place alarm across room requiring standup, go to bed 10 PM strict, no phone in bedroom, accountability partner texts 6:05 AM.  
Low energy initially — expect adjustment period Week 1-2, drink water immediately upon waking, light exercise acceptable first week.  
Weekends temptation to sleep in — keep same schedule 7 days/week, remember productivity gains worth temporary sacrifice, social events scheduled afternoons.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Updates every 10 days in comments: Days 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. Include wake time success rate, workouts completed, deep work hours, energy level changes.

# SECTION F: DEFINITION OF SUCCESS

Complete when: 60 consecutive 6 AM wakeups documented via timestamped photos, 60 workouts logged in fitness app, 60 journal entries shown, minimum 40 hours of morning deep work completed, measurable productivity improvement noted in tracker.",1,1763368233.0,FutureGoals,1,1.0,False

# Onboard

**1. Food**

Good… but not “amazing.” If you’re used to Sydney food quality, it’s hard to wow you. Still airplane food at the end of the day.

The food-on-cart service for entrées and desserts is a nice touch though.

**2. Crew**

Flight crew and ground crew were consistently friendly. No issues here.

**3. A350-900 Business Seats (wrap-around style)**

I’d read mixed things, but they’re fine — tight, yes, but not *terribly* tight. I’m not a small unit and still managed ok.

* Seat topper makes the seat a ***genuinely*** comfy mattress.
* Armrests *do* fold down (there’s a button on the front — discovered way too late).
* Footwell is a bit narrow but manageable.

**4. Larger folks, take note**

Table clearance and seatbelt length both have plenty of, uh, “tactical gut allowance.”

Also: takeoff/landing uses a car-seat-style shoulder harness, which was unexpected but easy.

**5. Turkish Coffee**

New addiction unlocked. Order it black. Let it sit for a minute so the grounds settle. Thank me later (once the caffeine induced shakes subside)

**6. Wi-Fi**

Surprisingly solid. Stayed active almost the entire flight, including landing. Whether that’s a blessing or a curse depends on who’s messaging you.

# KUL Stopover (1–2 hours)

Honestly, not great.

You land around 2:30am Malaysian time — humid, tired, no lounges you can access, and no easy way to shower.

Once you clear security there’s:

* Some paid coffee machines on the ground floor
* Toilets upstairs That’s about it. You’re basically sitting absorbing moisture until the next 11-hour leg.

# Arriving in IST (Istanbul Airport)

**1. This airport is massive**

Like… seriously huge. Bring glasses if you need them — signage isn’t great.

**2. Lounge Access & Layout**

The business-class lounge entrance is just past Duty Free near the D/E gates — you’ll see the seating area upstairs above the Duty Free area.

Inside the lounge:

* Showers/private suites are arranged via a counter (turn left after the automatic gates).
* They're on a I wait-list I waited \~30 mins for a shower.
* The shower rooms themselves are clean and spacious.
* Private suites: super hard to get. I qualified but none available, and weirdly they don’t use a waitlist.
* Luggage/bag storage is immediately left of the entrance — handy if you want to explore.

If your layover is **>9 hours** (with some conditions) you can request a **free hotel** at the counter *outside* the lounge. I’ll report back on that on the return trip.

The lounge itself:

* Very busy
* Heavy emphasis on food stations
* Adequate seating but not many places to actually recline or rest

# 3. Airport vibe overall

The entire airport feels designed around **food and luxury retail**, not passenger comfort. If you need something practical — like a razor or even basic meds — yer on yer own (until Ferragamo makes headache tablets).

When I joined, everything seemed normal. My direct boss (M42) was polite , friendly, a bit awkward sometimes, but nothing alarming. Slowly though, things shifted  in a way I didn’t notice until it had already become a pattern. It started with tiny favors.  “Can you double check this email for me?” or “Can you print this out before the meeting? ” The kind of tasks you don’t think twice about because you want to be helpful. But then it  escalated. Suddenly \*I\* was the one preparing his meeting notes, managing his calendar , reminding him of his deadlines, proofreading his presentations, and even ordering his lunch  because “you know what s good around here better than I do”. He never said it explicitly,  but at some point he just assumed this was my role. I’m not his assistant . I’m not even in the same department technically. My actual job is being held together by me  working extra hours because I spent half my day doing things he was perfectly capable of  doing himself. Last week was my breaking point. He sent me a message at 7:30 am asking  if I could “swing by the office kitchen before everyone arrives and make a fresh pot of coffee  for the team because mine never turns out right”. I literally stared at the screen for a full minute trying  to understand how he thought this was okay.

I replied politely: “I’m not comfortable  doing tasks that aren’t part of my role. I need to focus on my actual workload.” His response ? “Wow. There s no need to get emotional about it.” Emotional. Because I didn’t  want to be his maid.

I confronted him later and  told him directly that I felt taken advantage of. He rolled his eyes and said, “You know women are  better at this stuff. You’re more organized. It just makes sense.” I felt my face get hot. He  genuinely believed this wasn’t sexist, that it was just a “practical division of strengths” . I went home feeling humiliated and so, so small. I didn’t even tell my partner until the next  day because I felt stupid for letting it go on for this long. HR has a reputation for protecting  management here, so I’m scared to report it. But I can’t keep doing his job \*and\* mine . I’m exhausted and angry and honestly shocked that in 2025 I’m still hearing “you’re emotional”  for saying no to unpaid domestic labor. I don’t even know what I want from this post. Advice ? Validation? I just needed to say it somewhere where people won’t tell me I’m overreacting .",82,1763367818.0,TwoXChromosomes,16,0.94,False
