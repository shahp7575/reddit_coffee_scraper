I don't know how to handle that along with my own emotions.  I have a history too. I needed love too. I needed safety too. From the very beginning of us talking, I never had any idea what to expect from you. That's a terrible way to build trust with someone. Then you kept hurting me. Yes you hurt me. And I'm finally strong enough to walk away until you see all of the ways you hurt me since we've met. Unfortunately I do feel used, and strung along. I don't think you ever truly wanted me nor saw me for who I really was. I really wanted to love you with my whole heart, distance or no distance. You mirrored me; the good and the bad. I learned so much about myself because of you. I will always appreciate that. Thank you Favorite.  I will always miss you. You fit into my heart like a missing puzzle piece. You fill my soul like creamer in my coffee that you didn't have at your apartment.  You made me look at the world in a way I hadn't been able to in years. I see what I lost sight of. I hope you get everything you want in life and more. I hope you get the love you want so desperately- but can not be me. I was never good enough.  But I love you. I miss you already.  You're my Favorite. 
I love your voice,  the way you pace, your cute little mannerisms... I want so badly to hear you information dump while I sip coffee. You were always trying to teach me something. I miss you so much. Please please have a good life and HEAL. Please.

I'm back from my recent trip and will share my trip report.**

[Here's the Part 1 - India (if anyone is interested)](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1n6cqa4/trip_report_part_1_india_2025_delhi_agra_jaipur/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

*The continuation of the journey to another world wonder, I had decent hours of layover in Hanoi to Beijing that I made the most out of!* 

* **Day 7 - August 22 (Hanoi Layover - Flight to Beijing)**

***Morning.*** Due to the flight delay, I arrived in Hanoi by 9 AM. I immediately exchanged cash and went straight to the **Old Quarters**. 

**10 AM.** I walk around until I reach my first destination - **Hoa Lo Prison**. I was there for two hours and learned a lot of things about what happened inside that prison. 

**12 PM**. I made my way to the **Train Street** which was on time for the next train to pass by. I got myself a Banh Mi and a drink. 

**1 PM.** I booked a Grab to experience the motorcycle ride going to a Phở Khôi Hói restaurant. 

**2 PM**. I walk all the way to **Manzi Art Space and Cafe** and grab a coconut coffee drink. 

**3 PM**. I went back to the Old Quarters area and explored some of the shops before I booked another Grab Taxi to the airport. 

*Hanoi Travel Summary:* I feel like I tick all the boxes of a Hanoi experience and I can’t wait to go back for the full experience. 

* **Day 8 - August 23 (Beijing Arrival - Food Walk Tour)**

**1 AM.** I arrived in Beijing Daxing and believe it or not the immigration is so slow considering it’s China. I feel bad for the Visa on Arrival area, there are around 3-4 staff accommodating the tourist with visa. 

I booked a Didi going to my hotel in the **Chaoyang** area. My driver approached me at the airport parking lot and he canceled the booking through the app saying that he cannot withdraw cash from Didi and I’ll pay with cash instead. My mind was all over just agreeing on what he says because I’m so tired from the flight and frustrated at the immigration. 

I don’t have any RMB with me so he said he accepts USD. I paid him $100, he offered to be my driver going to the Great Wall the next day and I also gave him another $100 for down payment. (more story for the next day).

I reached my hotel room, check-in, and took a rest by 4 AM. I woke up before 10 AM to get the most out of hotel breakfast. I took a nap again and rescheduled the things on my itinerary. 

***Afternoon.*** It was raining that time and I prepared to leave my hotel to go to the meeting point for my **Food Tour Beijing** (which I also booked on GuruWalk). We started from **Nanluoguxiang** station, walk our way to the lake and the market areas around. The guide was so gracious with her time that we ended up at almost 10 PM and we had so much fun (supposed to end at 8 PM).

***Night.*** I went back to my room to sleep early for my 7 AM pickup the next day. While I was negotiating with my driver, I told him how much it cost me for the whole trip. He didn’t give me any price but just the itinerary. 

We talked through WeChat and all of a sudden my account got restricted because of this reason (I cannot send messages to him and to anyone but I can use the payment option). I was thinking how I could reach him but then I immediately asked for my food tour guide's help in order to talk to him. 

* **Day 9 - August 24 (Great Wall Day - Walk around Sanlitun Area - Choyaang Area)**

***Morning.*** The driver got lost telling me that he was in the area by 6 AM (This was part of the story because he will charge an hour with him). I just told him it’s ok, then we went to **Badaling Great Wall.** The weather is gloomy which balances the hot weather during that time. 

I made my way walking through the different side of the wall. I started from the **South Side** of the Wall (less people) all the way to the Tower near the washroom then I went back to the main entrance, walked my way to the **North Side** of the wall and took the **Toboggan ride** (80 RMB) leading to the **Panda Park** in the end. 

***Afternoon.*** While driving back to Beijing, the driver is giving me weird vibes asking me so many personal things, most especially about money. I was skeptical then he stopped on the side of the road negotiating how much money I would give him. He calculated the number of hours he was with me from 6 AM (he reached my area past 7 AM) until 12 PM. He presented the amount of $300 including the food that we will eat. I told him I don’t have enough money with me but instead, we went back to my hotel to get it and pay him. 

It was almost 3 PM that time and a restaurant that we were supposed to go to was inside the train station and the officer said that we need a ticket to go inside (my driver cancelled the restaurant reservation). Instead, he offers to just have my food delivered in my hotel room. 

***Night.*** I went outside to explore the **Sanliun Taikoo Li** area. There were a lot of high end brands so I immediately went to a different mall called **Chaoyang Joy City** then went back to my hotel room. 

* **Day 10 - August 25 (Monday Exploration in Beijing - Last Full Day)**

***Morning.*** Since it’s Monday, everything is closed. As I searched, some were open like **Jingshan Park** but the viewpoint was closed. I walked my way to the Forbidden City area, everything was closed, even the pedestrian, so the tourist had to reroute on where to go. I made my way to Wangfujing subway and went to the **Olympic Park** and **Beijing Olympics Museum** (also closed at that time). 

***Afternoon***\*.\* I went back to my hotel room and grabbed some take out food from a restaurant nearby. Also, I would like to point out the convenience of not having to talk to someone while ordering. 

***Night.*** I went to the **798 Art District** where I took the bus for the first time. As expected, the art exhibits are closed or either preparing for another exhibit but the art installations outside are amazing to look at. I also had my dinner in the area then went back to my hotel. 

* **Day 11 - August 26 (Train to Nanjing - Half day Nanjing Exploration)**

***Morning.*** I took my time to leave at least an hour just to see how the train intercity station works and looks like. When I reached the **Beijingnan (Beijing South)** railway station, there’s a special lane for foreigners where you’ll handover your passport to the officer and your ticket is automatically linked to it. The boarding starts at least 10-15 minutes before you enter and scan the passport at the gates. I arrived at **Nanjingnan (Nanjing South)** railway station before 12 PM. 

***Afternoon.*** I took the subway from the train station going to my hotel and I arrived before my check-in so I dropped my bags and explored the city first. I had lunch at a nearby restaurant serving Duck Noodle Soup and I ordered a side of potstickers and roast duck. 

After check-in, I settled down for a while and made my way to **Xuanwumen Park** and walked around the area, waited for the sunset, and made my way to the **City Wall Nanjing** before I went back to my hotel. 

***Night***\*.\* I went to this bar called **Skylounge** I found in Dianping that has an overlooking view of the **Qinhuai River**. This time my WeChat doesn’t work for ordering due to the restrictions I got from Beijing negotiation with my driver so I had to appeal this time. The good thing is that the bar staff helped me to order and pay with Alipay. 

* **Day 12 - August 27 (Full Day in Nanjing)** 

***Morning***\*.\* I started my day going to **Niushoushan** around 9 AM. The heat was unbearable that day and I feel like I cannot survive while walking towards the area. The bus ticket is separate from the entrance ticket itself so I thought it was included (cost 10 RMB one way). I spend my time going inside the Buddhist temple which is so magical and the architecture reminds me of the Louvre Abu Dhabi exterior. 

***Afternoon.*** I booked a Didi going to the **Presidential Palace** which I regret because it was so hot inside and there’s limited English translation with the exhibit. Even the Presidential Palace itself is under renovation so I immediately went to my next location. 

I took a subway going to  **The Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre**. When I arrived, I was greeted with long lines and I immediately got discouraged going inside. I walk all the way to the ticketing side and the good thing is that there’s less people in that area. Ticket is free! This museum is so heartbreaking, there’s a lot of things that I learned about what happened in Nanjing. This is a must visit for all the tourists.

I spent around 2 hours in the area and it rained so hard that I was drenched looking for shade or anything to keep me dry while looking for the subway on my way back to the hotel. 

***Night.*** I met a local friend that is so kind enough to order the local Nanjing food for me. There’s also a Taylor Swift theme bar called **Willow** nearby the area so we ended our night in that place. 

* **Day 13 - August 28 (Train to Suzhou - Shantang Road)**

***Morning***\*.\* I woke up to have a morning run around my area (which I immediately regret because I needed to dry my clothes) before I started to prepare for a train ride to Suzhou. I reached **Nanjing Railway Station** by 10 AM\*\*.\*\* I cannot find the entrance for the foreigners passport check, but it turns out you just need to go to the security area which is on the left most side of the turnstile entrance. 

***Afternoon.*** I took the subway from the train station and I reached my hotel in Suzhou at exactly the check-in time. I settled down and went to find some restaurants nearby. I can’t remember where I started my walking journey but I think it was at **Xiangmen Station** then I walked my way around. I encountered local hagglers shouting at me saying *“hey, I know you*” and offering to buy watches from them but I immediately went inside a clothing store so they don’t follow me anymore. 

***Night***. I don’t know why I ended up in the **Tiger Hill** area alighting the train station so I started my journey by walking all the way to the main **Shantang Street** which is around 30 minutes. I reached the area and had the experience of taking the boat ride which also takes at least 30 minutes along the river. 

* **Day 14 - August 29 (Morning in Suzhou - Train to Shanghai)**

***Morning.*** I had the attempt to go for a walk-in in **Suzhou Museum** but the reservations were full when I got to the visitor center. I went to the **Humble Administrator’s Garden** instead. I feel like I didn’t maximize my time there because I cannot function well with the heat so I just walk my way to the exit. I was there for at least an hour of walking around before I looked for a restaurant and had lunch nearby.

***Afternoon.*** I prepare my bags to catch my train to Shanghai. I didn’t expect the Suzhou traffic on the way to the train station. I immediately told the driver that I will just exit the taxi and run all the way to the entrance. It was 5 minutes before the departure and I luckily made it. 

**1 PM.** I reached Shanghai in the afternoon, another mistake that I made was that my hotel was so far from the tourist attraction (Hongquiao area but my departure airport will be in Pudong). 

After check-in, I booked a Didi going to **AP Plaza**. I wanted to buy some gadgets for myself and at least shoes, clothes, etc. I can’t find it immediately, It was under the subway station. I went to the electronics store and bought some stuff. After purchasing, the owner of the store leads me to a watch store which is not my priority and they are really eager to sell stuff (I was there around 20-30 minutes while they are negotiating with me and I was just there standing saying NO).

It was frustrating, I didn’t get a chance to go around because I don’t want to get haggle anymore so I just went back to my hotel room. 

***Night.*** I dropped my bags and went out to go to the bar which is so much fun after all the chaos in the afternoon. 

* **Day 15 - August 30 (Full Day in Shanghai)**

***Morning***\*\*.\*\* I canceled my Walking Tour because I reached home by 4 AM yesterday. I just went out at my own pace. I started my morning by going to the **Shanghai Museum** and saw a lot of interesting artwork, pieces, and much more inside. My favorite area was Ming and Qing Rhinoceros Horn Carvings.

***Afternoon.*** I went my way to **Yuyuan Old Street** to explore. There were a lot of choices to eat around so you could never go wrong. There are also beggars around which is surprising in that area with a QR Code if you want to donate them. My favorite was the Nanxiang Steam Bun Restaurant - I got a takeout dumpling which you can find anywhere. 

I took the subway and went to the other side of the Bund to take a photo. I saw it on Tiktok and a photo spot for fellow tourists. I went inside the mall and ate lunch nearby. 

After that, I went to the **Qipu Clothing** area which is like AP Plaza full of haggling. There’s one lady who leads me to a secret compartment full of fake designers. I saw a LOEWE shirt and they offered me 2000 RMB. I bought pants and a shirt in a different area - The price is fixed so there’s no haggling. 150 RMB for a pair of pants and 150 RMB for two shirts. 

***Night.*** I went back to the Bund, the main view near the **Golden Bridge**, to see Shanghai at night. I walked around the area after that I went back to my hotel room. 

* **Day 16 - August 31 (Flight back to Dubai)**

***Morning.*** I just prepared for my things going to the airport. They do check the power banks at the security after immigration but they didn’t confiscate my power bank without CCC. 

*End of China Trip Summary: I love Beijing maybe because I spend the most of my time there. Probably if I come back, I’ll start my journey in Shanghai because it doesn’t pique my interest at the first time.* 

***Other tips:***

* I bought my ESIM through Trip (100 GB Daily - I only used around 30 GB in a total of 9 days).
* I’m so worried about using WeChat and Alipay that I had to buy an ice cream in McDonald's just to check if it works lol
* There are times that my WeChat Mini App doesn’t work for food as it requires a local number so I just approach the staff to order. 
* There are also times that using WeChat Pay requires an OTP so I rely mostly on Alipay in this case (It works eventually when it was my last day in Shanghai)
* Transportation is easy, just change the options using Alipay. 
* The traffic is so real that it’s much more convenient to use the metro (especially in Shanghai). 
* For shopping, locals said to just shop on Taobao (need local number). Skip AP Plaza and Qipu Clothing because I didn’t get a chance to wander around instead got bombarded with locals offering their services. ",1,1756980251.0,chinatravel,2,1.0,False

***Night.*** I met a local friend that is so kind enough to order the local Nanjing food for me. There’s also a Taylor Swift theme bar called **Willow** nearby the area so we ended our night in that place. 

* **Day 13 - August 28 (Train to Suzhou - Shantang Road)**

***Morning***\*.\* I woke up to have a morning run around my area (which I immediately regret because I needed to dry my clothes) before I started to prepare for a train ride to Suzhou. I reached **Nanjing Railway Station** by 10 AM\*\*.\*\* I cannot find the entrance for the foreigners passport check, but it turns out you just need to go to the security area which is on the left most side of the turnstile entrance. 

***Afternoon.*** I took the subway from the train station and I reached my hotel in Suzhou at exactly the check-in time. I settled down and went to find some restaurants nearby. I can’t remember where I started my walking journey but I think it was at **Xiangmen Station** then I walked my way around. I encountered local hagglers shouting at me saying *“hey, I know you*” and offering to buy watches from them but I immediately went inside a clothing store so they don’t follow me anymore. 

***Night***. I don’t know why I ended up in the **Tiger Hill** area alighting the train station so I started my journey by walking all the way to the main **Shantang Street** which is around 30 minutes. I reached the area and had the experience of taking the boat ride which also takes at least 30 minutes along the river. 

* **Day 14 - August 29 (Morning in Suzhou - Train to Shanghai)**

***Morning.*** I had the attempt to go for a walk-in in **Suzhou Museum** but the reservations were full when I got to the visitor center. I went to the **Humble Administrator’s Garden** instead. I feel like I didn’t maximize my time there because I cannot function well with the heat so I just walk my way to the exit. I was there for at least an hour of walking around before I looked for a restaurant and had lunch nearby.

***Afternoon.*** I prepare my bags to catch my train to Shanghai. I didn’t expect the Suzhou traffic on the way to the train station. I immediately told the driver that I will just exit the taxi and run all the way to the entrance. It was 5 minutes before the departure and I luckily made it. 

**1 PM.** I reached Shanghai in the afternoon, another mistake that I made was that my hotel was so far from the tourist attraction (Hongquiao area but my departure airport will be in Pudong). 

After check-in, I booked a Didi going to **AP Plaza**. I wanted to buy some gadgets for myself and at least shoes, clothes, etc. I can’t find it immediately, It was under the subway station. I went to the electronics store and bought some stuff. After purchasing, the owner of the store leads me to a watch store which is not my priority and they are really eager to sell stuff (I was there around 20-30 minutes while they are negotiating with me and I was just there standing saying NO).

It was frustrating, I didn’t get a chance to go around because I don’t want to get haggle anymore so I just went back to my hotel room. 

***Night.*** I dropped my bags and went out to go to the bar which is so much fun after all the chaos in the afternoon. 

* **Day 15 - August 30 (Full Day in Shanghai)**

***Morning***\*\*.\*\* I canceled my Walking Tour because I reached home by 4 AM yesterday. I just went out at my own pace. I started my morning by going to the **Shanghai Museum** and saw a lot of interesting artwork, pieces, and much more inside. My favorite area was Ming and Qing Rhinoceros Horn Carvings.

***Afternoon.*** I went my way to **Yuyuan Old Street** to explore. There were a lot of choices to eat around so you could never go wrong. There are also beggars around which is surprising in that area with a QR Code if you want to donate them. My favorite was the Nanxiang Steam Bun Restaurant - I got a takeout dumpling which you can find anywhere. 

I took the subway and went to the other side of the Bund to take a photo. I saw it on Tiktok and a photo spot for fellow tourists. I went inside the mall and ate lunch nearby. 

After that, I went to the **Qipu Clothing** area which is like AP Plaza full of haggling. There’s one lady who leads me to a secret compartment full of fake designers. I saw a LOEWE shirt and they offered me 2000 RMB. I bought pants and a shirt in a different area - The price is fixed so there’s no haggling. 150 RMB for a pair of pants and 150 RMB for two shirts. 

***Night.*** I went back to the Bund, the main view near the **Golden Bridge**, to see Shanghai at night. I walked around the area after that I went back to my hotel room. 

* **Day 16 - August 31 (Flight back to Dubai)**

***Morning.*** I just prepared for my things going to the airport. They do check the power banks at the security after immigration but they didn’t confiscate my power bank without CCC. 

*End of China Trip Summary: I love Beijing maybe because I spend the most of my time there. Probably if I come back, I’ll start my journey in Shanghai because it doesn’t pique my interest at the first time.* 

***Other tips:***

* I bought my ESIM through Trip (100 GB Daily - I only used around 30 GB in a total of 9 days).
* I’m so worried about using WeChat and Alipay that I had to buy an ice cream in McDonald's just to check if it works lol
* There are times that my WeChat Mini App doesn’t work for food as it requires a local number so I just approach the staff to order. 
* There are also times that using WeChat Pay requires an OTP so I rely mostly on Alipay in this case (It works eventually when it was my last day in Shanghai)
* Transportation is easy, just change the options using Alipay. 
* The traffic is so real that it’s much more convenient to use the metro (especially in Shanghai). 
* For shopping, locals said to just shop on Taobao (need local number). Skip AP Plaza and Qipu Clothing because I didn’t get a chance to wander around instead got bombarded with locals offering their services.

I (f21) am having the hardest time making friends. I am a very genuine person and have a great personality but I just have a lot of anxiety. For some back story my mother never really showed me girly things (doing my hair, makeup, pink sparkly things, ect.) and I never had sisters. So I never really learned what it was like to have that best friend to help in girly moments. Don’t get me wrong I have a few friends from high school that have family’s now and/or just don’t talk to me nor want to hang out. How am I supposed to make friends? I go out and do stuff but never meet friends to hang with. I am super shy and kinda awkward when meeting new people. I also don’t open up easily and I’d like to have a friend that I can talk to and go on fun shopping days or just getting some coffee & chatting. I have been used to many times by people I thought were close friends/family and I really don’t want that to happen again. Having no friends at this age kinda sucks. I just want to feel more feminine and find my bestie. Any advice on how I can make friends at this age?

1n85yjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1n85yjy/i_spent_3_years_preparing_for_a_career_change/,I spent 3 years 'preparing' for a career change instead of just making it,"I see a lot of posts here about people stuck in analysis paralysis - researching careers, making pros/cons lists, waiting for the ""perfect"" opportunity.

I was that person, but with starting a business.

For 3 years, I told myself I needed to find the ""right"" technical co-founder before I could build my startup idea. I went to networking events, tried co-founder apps (CoffeeSpace, YC Co-founder matching etc.), participated in many accelerators (Antler, ODF etc.) and had dozens of coffee meetings.

The truth? I was staying busy with other projects,  building no-code apps, experimenting with different business ideas, hustling on side projects. But I wasn't working on the thing I actually cared about because that felt too hard without the ""right"" partner.

December 2024, sitting on a couch in SF at 2am, I realized: I'd spent more time looking for someone to build with than it would take to just learn and build it myself.

So I gave myself 3 weeks to try. I'd never coded anything real before.

**What I learned about productive procrastination:**

**My excuse:** ""I need a technical co-founder first""  
**Reality:** I was avoiding the scary thing by doing easier adjacent work

**My excuse:** ""I need more validation""  
**Reality:** I had 3 years of user research but was afraid to commit

3 weeks later, I had a working product with real users.

**The framework that broke my procrastination cycle:**

1. **Call out the real fear** \- What am I actually avoiding?
2. **Set an artificial deadline** \- ""I'll try this for X weeks""
3. **Define the smallest win** \- What's one tiny thing I can do to prove it's possible?
4. **Accept imperfection** \- Version 1 is supposed to suck

**The career parallel**:

How many of us take courses, research industries, seek help from Reddit, optimize LinkedIn - but avoid actually networking and/or applying for the role we want or making the industry switch?

Sometimes the research phase becomes the procrastination phase.

I'm not saying be reckless, of course, but if you've been ""preparing"" for the same career move for months, maybe you're more ready than you think.

I think the best career advice I've ever received is **""Start before you're ready""**

The thing you're avoiding might be easier than the mental energy you're spending avoiding it.

**What are you staying busy with instead of doing the thing you actually want to try?**

Happy to chat if this resonates or if you want to talk through what you're procrastinating on.

**P.S. Plot twist**: I still catch myself doing this with other decisions, but as soon as I realize I'm ""researching"" instead of doing, I break the pattern.",1,1756979900.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False
1n85ybj,https://www.reddit.com/r/classifiedsph/comments/1n85ybj/looking_for_an_assistant_for_my_mom_to_help_her/,Looking for an Assistant for my Mom to help her in 2 new business ventures,"My mom is going to open a barber shop and a coffee-and-bakes cafe in Imus, Cavite. They will be located at a busy intersection along roads that are lined with subdivisions, commercial establishments, and public schools.

I am currently out of the country, and my mom is the one who's currently working on them. She's now 54 years old, and needs help with regard to business preparations. As such, I am looking for an assistant who can help her in the new business ventures. I will give directions and instructions, and my mom, together with the assistant (and sometimes my dad), will brainstorm, assess options, and execute them.

Specifically, I foresee that the part-time assistant will need to assist my parents in the following:  
. Taking notes  
. Brainstorming with my mom  
. Monitoring what needs to be done by when  
. Assisting her in getting DTI business name registration, barangay clearance, mayor’s permit/business permit, BIR registration, DOH sanitary permit (for barber shop), Fire Safety Inspection Certificate  
. Assisting in CCTV installations  
. Assisting in getting POS system, Gcash acceptance  
. Assting in preparing daily cash reconciliation logbook  
. Liaising with the landlord, architect, and contractor  
. Liasing with the photographer/videographer for content materials  
. Liasing and printing posters / tarpaulins / flyers  
. Looking for, liaising with, and negotiating with baked goods suppliers  
. Searching for staff uniforms or liaising with where they’ll be bought from  
. Helping monitor construction progress and receipt of materials  
. Checking the competition (price, quality, etc.)  
. Assisting in finalizing services and “reasonable” / competitive pricing  
. Fleshing out promo ideas (e.g. discounts, coffee+bake bundles, loyalty program, etc.)  
. Preparation of menu boards, QR codes for online menus  
. Looking for, canvassing for, and purchasing things like aircon, portable washing sink, signages, speakers, fridge, coffee machine, ice maker, microwave, tables and chairs, wifi connection  
. Looking for and canvassing supplies like hair products, cleaning materials, broom, mop, cloth, dishwashing liquid, napkins/tissues, double-walled glasses, utensils, portable utensils, saucers, coffee cups, logo printing on take-out packaging materials, coffee syrups, pots  
. Calculating target revenues for different products in different scenarios  
. Creating and constructing Facebook and Google Maps listings  
. Liasing for the creation of and preparing marketing materials, printing if needed  
. Discovering how to do deliveries / inclusion in delivery apps maybe?  
. Any tasks related to that I might have missed

The qualifications, then, would be:  
. Someone preferably currently studying or a graduate of a **business, marketing, or accountancy** course, or has previous freelance, voluntary, or work experience in those fields  
. Sociable (because it involves a lot of discussions and reaching out to different people)  
. Can do basic calculations (of sales targets and overhead costs, for instance)  
. Web-savvy (because it involves a lot of Facebook / online research)  
. Preferably living in or can go to Imus, Cavite, so you can meet with my parents and go with them to the appliances stores and stuff  
. My parents are 54 years old, so it would be great if you are patient, persistent, and can handle kind, Evangelical Christian, Imus born-and-raised parents

We need an assistant **only until** the businesses get up and running. Of course, you can perhaps explore other ""raket"" options with me / my mom afterwards if my parents like you :) And probably to execute marketing campaigns. I'll be giving directions for that, too.

Currently, I'm thinking of paying **P70 per hour**. But I can't really say how short or how long each day would be (although you would likely be done by the evening because my dad wants to turn in early). I also can't say how long it will take, so it can be an ongoing thing, but of course **I personally want to open these businesses ASAP**. That'll be daily payment. **I'm open to negotiating the hourly rate.**

So for, say, 8 hours, it will be P560, and since it's going to be a daily affair, after 15 days of consistent 8-hour work you'll get up to P8400. Or higher if we agree on one. It really depends on how short or how long each day will be, depending on my mom and dad. If you don't have a lot of time and you can just make it 2 hours in a day, then 4 hours the next day, 2 hours the next day, and so on, then the payment will just be computed accordingly.

**Public transpo fares and other costs related to it** (ex. You will eat out in a mall because you're looking for supplies with my mom, or you'll buy different kinds of cookies to taste them) will of course be provided for.

If you're interested, please do cut to the chase and let me know your thoughts about it, and provide what's essentially your CV. (Just send me a message here.) You can hide your names if you want in our first contact, if that's an issue, haha. For now I really just want to see your experience/interests/motivation/where you're from/if you can make it to them in Imus and if you're a good fit for my mom :) And above all, I want to get those businesses up and running -- and hopefully get them teeming with customers -- ASAP!!! :)

*The continuation of the journey to another world wonder, I had decent hours of layover in Hanoi to Beijing that I made the most out of!* 

* **Day 7 - August 22 (Hanoi Layover - Flight to Beijing)**

***Morning.*** Due to the flight delay, I arrived in Hanoi by 9 AM. I immediately exchanged cash and went straight to the **Old Quarters**. 

**10 AM.** I walk around until I reach my first destination - **Hoa Lo Prison**. I was there for two hours and learned a lot of things about what happened inside that prison. 

**12 PM**. I made my way to the **Train Street** which was on time for the next train to pass by. I got myself a Banh Mi and a drink. 

**1 PM.** I booked a Grab to experience the motorcycle ride going to a Phở Khôi Hói restaurant. 

**2 PM**. I walk all the way to **Manzi Art Space and Cafe** and grab a coconut coffee drink. 

**3 PM**. I went back to the Old Quarters area and explored some of the shops before I booked another Grab Taxi to the airport. 

*Hanoi Travel Summary:* I feel like I tick all the boxes of a Hanoi experience and I can’t wait to go back for the full experience. 

* **Day 8 - August 23 (Beijing Arrival - Food Walk Tour)**

**1 AM.** I arrived in Beijing Daxing and believe it or not the immigration is so slow considering it’s China. I feel bad for the Visa on Arrival area, there are around 3-4 staff accommodating the tourist with visa. 

I booked a Didi going to my hotel in the **Chaoyang** area. My driver approached me at the airport parking lot and he canceled the booking through the app saying that he cannot withdraw cash from Didi and I’ll pay with cash instead. My mind was all over just agreeing on what he says because I’m so tired from the flight and frustrated at the immigration. 

I don’t have any RMB with me so he said he accepts USD. I paid him $100, he offered to be my driver going to the Great Wall the next day and I also gave him another $100 for down payment. (more story for the next day).

I reached my hotel room, check-in, and took a rest by 4 AM. I woke up before 10 AM to get the most out of hotel breakfast. I took a nap again and rescheduled the things on my itinerary. 

***Afternoon.*** It was raining that time and I prepared to leave my hotel to go to the meeting point for my **Food Tour Beijing** (which I also booked on GuruWalk). We started from **Nanluoguxiang** station, walk our way to the lake and the market areas around. The guide was so gracious with her time that we ended up at almost 10 PM and we had so much fun (supposed to end at 8 PM).

***Night.*** I went back to my room to sleep early for my 7 AM pickup the next day. While I was negotiating with my driver, I told him how much it cost me for the whole trip. He didn’t give me any price but just the itinerary. 

We talked through WeChat and all of a sudden my account got restricted because of this reason (I cannot send messages to him and to anyone but I can use the payment option). I was thinking how I could reach him but then I immediately asked for my food tour guide's help in order to talk to him. 

* **Day 9 - August 24 (Great Wall Day - Walk around Sanlitun Area - Choyaang Area)**

***Morning.*** The driver got lost telling me that he was in the area by 6 AM (This was part of the story because he will charge an hour with him). I just told him it’s ok, then we went to **Badaling Great Wall.** The weather is gloomy which balances the hot weather during that time. 

I made my way walking through the different side of the wall. I started from the **South Side** of the Wall (less people) all the way to the Tower near the washroom then I went back to the main entrance, walked my way to the **North Side** of the wall and took the **Toboggan ride** (80 RMB) leading to the **Panda Park** in the end. 

***Afternoon.*** While driving back to Beijing, the driver is giving me weird vibes asking me so many personal things, most especially about money. I was skeptical then he stopped on the side of the road negotiating how much money I would give him. He calculated the number of hours he was with me from 6 AM (he reached my area past 7 AM) until 12 PM. He presented the amount of $300 including the food that we will eat. I told him I don’t have enough money with me but instead, we went back to my hotel to get it and pay him. 

It was almost 3 PM that time and a restaurant that we were supposed to go to was inside the train station and the officer said that we need a ticket to go inside (my driver cancelled the restaurant reservation). Instead, he offers to just have my food delivered in my hotel room. 

***Night.*** I went outside to explore the **Sanliun Taikoo Li** area. There were a lot of high end brands so I immediately went to a different mall called **Chaoyang Joy City** then went back to my hotel room. 

* **Day 10 - August 25 (Monday Exploration in Beijing - Last Full Day)**

***Morning.*** Since it’s Monday, everything is closed. As I searched, some were open like **Jingshan Park** but the viewpoint was closed. I walked my way to the Forbidden City area, everything was closed, even the pedestrian, so the tourist had to reroute on where to go. I made my way to Wangfujing subway and went to the **Olympic Park** and **Beijing Olympics Museum** (also closed at that time). 

***Afternoon***\*.\* I went back to my hotel room and grabbed some take out food from a restaurant nearby. Also, I would like to point out the convenience of not having to talk to someone while ordering. 

***Night.*** I went to the **798 Art District** where I took the bus for the first time. As expected, the art exhibits are closed or either preparing for another exhibit but the art installations outside are amazing to look at. I also had my dinner in the area then went back to my hotel. 

* **Day 11 - August 26 (Train to Nanjing - Half day Nanjing Exploration)**

***Morning.*** I took my time to leave at least an hour just to see how the train intercity station works and looks like. When I reached the **Beijingnan (Beijing South)** railway station, there’s a special lane for foreigners where you’ll handover your passport to the officer and your ticket is automatically linked to it. The boarding starts at least 10-15 minutes before you enter and scan the passport at the gates. I arrived at **Nanjingnan (Nanjing South)** railway station before 12 PM. 

***Afternoon.*** I took the subway from the train station going to my hotel and I arrived before my check-in so I dropped my bags and explored the city first. I had lunch at a nearby restaurant serving Duck Noodle Soup and I ordered a side of potstickers and roast duck. 

After check-in, I settled down for a while and made my way to **Xuanwumen Park** and walked around the area, waited for the sunset, and made my way to the **City Wall Nanjing** before I went back to my hotel. 

***Night***\*.\* I went to this bar called **Skylounge** I found in Dianping that has an overlooking view of the **Qinhuai River**. This time my WeChat doesn’t work for ordering due to the restrictions I got from Beijing negotiation with my driver so I had to appeal this time. The good thing is that the bar staff helped me to order and pay with Alipay. 

* **Day 12 - August 27 (Full Day in Nanjing)** 

***Morning***\*.\* I started my day going to **Niushoushan** around 9 AM. The heat was unbearable that day and I feel like I cannot survive while walking towards the area. The bus ticket is separate from the entrance ticket itself so I thought it was included (cost 10 RMB one way). I spend my time going inside the Buddhist temple which is so magical and the architecture reminds me of the Louvre Abu Dhabi exterior. 

***Afternoon.*** I booked a Didi going to the **Presidential Palace** which I regret because it was so hot inside and there’s limited English translation with the exhibit. Even the Presidential Palace itself is under renovation so I immediately went to my next location. 

I took a subway going to  **The Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre**. When I arrived, I was greeted with long lines and I immediately got discouraged going inside. I walk all the way to the ticketing side and the good thing is that there’s less people in that area. Ticket is free! This museum is so heartbreaking, there’s a lot of things that I learned about what happened in Nanjing. This is a must visit for all the tourists.

I spent around 2 hours in the area and it rained so hard that I was drenched looking for shade or anything to keep me dry while looking for the subway on my way back to the hotel. 

***Night.*** I met a local friend that is so kind enough to order the local Nanjing food for me. There’s also a Taylor Swift theme bar called **Willow** nearby the area so we ended our night in that place. 

* **Day 13 - August 28 (Train to Suzhou - Shantang Road)**

***Morning***\*.\* I woke up to have a morning run around my area (which I immediately regret because I needed to dry my clothes) before I started to prepare for a train ride to Suzhou. I reached **Nanjing Railway Station** by 10 AM\*\*.\*\* I cannot find the entrance for the foreigners passport check, but it turns out you just need to go to the security area which is on the left most side of the turnstile entrance. 

***Afternoon.*** I took the subway from the train station and I reached my hotel in Suzhou at exactly the check-in time. I settled down and went to find some restaurants nearby. I can’t remember where I started my walking journey but I think it was at **Xiangmen Station** then I walked my way around. I encountered local hagglers shouting at me saying *“hey, I know you*” and offering to buy watches from them but I immediately went inside a clothing store so they don’t follow me anymore. 

***Night***. I don’t know why I ended up in the **Tiger Hill** area alighting the train station so I started my journey by walking all the way to the main **Shantang Street** which is around 30 minutes. I reached the area and had the experience of taking the boat ride which also takes at least 30 minutes along the river. 

* **Day 14 - August 29 (Morning in Suzhou - Train to Shanghai)**

***Morning.*** I had the attempt to go for a walk-in in **Suzhou Museum** but the reservations were full when I got to the visitor center. I went to the **Humble Administrator’s Garden** instead. I feel like I didn’t maximize my time there because I cannot function well with the heat so I just walk my way to the exit. I was there for at least an hour of walking around before I looked for a restaurant and had lunch nearby.

***Afternoon.*** I prepare my bags to catch my train to Shanghai. I didn’t expect the Suzhou traffic on the way to the train station. I immediately told the driver that I will just exit the taxi and run all the way to the entrance. It was 5 minutes before the departure and I luckily made it. 

**1 PM.** I reached Shanghai in the afternoon, another mistake that I made was that my hotel was so far from the tourist attraction (Hongquiao area but my departure airport will be in Pudong). 

After check-in, I booked a Didi going to **AP Plaza**. I wanted to buy some gadgets for myself and at least shoes, clothes, etc. I can’t find it immediately, It was under the subway station. I went to the electronics store and bought some stuff. After purchasing, the owner of the store leads me to a watch store which is not my priority and they are really eager to sell stuff (I was there around 20-30 minutes while they are negotiating with me and I was just there standing saying NO).

It was frustrating, I didn’t get a chance to go around because I don’t want to get haggle anymore so I just went back to my hotel room. 

***Night.*** I dropped my bags and went out to go to the bar which is so much fun after all the chaos in the afternoon. 

* **Day 15 - August 30 (Full Day in Shanghai)**

***Morning***\*\*.\*\* I canceled my Walking Tour because I reached home by 4 AM yesterday. I just went out at my own pace. I started my morning by going to the **Shanghai Museum** and saw a lot of interesting artwork, pieces, and much more inside. My favorite area was Ming and Qing Rhinoceros Horn Carvings.

***Afternoon.*** I went my way to **Yuyuan Old Street** to explore. There were a lot of choices to eat around so you could never go wrong. There are also beggars around which is surprising in that area with a QR Code if you want to donate them. My favorite was the Nanxiang Steam Bun Restaurant - I got a takeout dumpling which you can find anywhere. 

I took the subway and went to the other side of the Bund to take a photo. I saw it on Tiktok and a photo spot for fellow tourists. I went inside the mall and ate lunch nearby. 

After that, I went to the **Qipu Clothing** area which is like AP Plaza full of haggling. There’s one lady who leads me to a secret compartment full of fake designers. I saw a LOEWE shirt and they offered me 2000 RMB. I bought pants and a shirt in a different area - The price is fixed so there’s no haggling. 150 RMB for a pair of pants and 150 RMB for two shirts. 

***Night.*** I went back to the Bund, the main view near the **Golden Bridge**, to see Shanghai at night. I walked around the area after that I went back to my hotel room. 

* **Day 16 - August 31 (Flight back to Dubai)**

***Morning.*** I just prepared for my things going to the airport. They do check the power banks at the security after immigration but they didn’t confiscate my power bank without CCC. 

*End of China Trip Summary: I love Beijing maybe because I spend the most of my time there. Probably if I come back, I’ll start my journey in Shanghai because it doesn’t pique my interest at the first time.* 

***Other tips:***

* I bought my ESIM through Trip (100 GB Daily - I only used around 30 GB in a total of 9 days).
* I’m so worried about using WeChat and Alipay that I had to buy an ice cream in McDonald's just to check if it works lol
* There are times that my WeChat Mini App doesn’t work for food as it requires a local number so I just approach the staff to order. 
* There are also times that using WeChat Pay requires an OTP so I rely mostly on Alipay in this case (It works eventually when it was my last day in Shanghai)
* Transportation is easy, just change the options using Alipay. 
* The traffic is so real that it’s much more convenient to use the metro (especially in Shanghai). 
* For shopping, locals said to just shop on Taobao (need local number). Skip AP Plaza and Qipu Clothing because I didn’t get a chance to wander around instead got bombarded with locals offering their services. ",1,1756979871.0,travel,0,1.0,False

I’m wondering if anyone else struggles finding the meaning of drinking coffee.

For context, M37, from a coffee-drinking country, I have been drinking coffee twice a day (espresso mostly, caffellatte occasionally) for 20 years but always have done for socializing rather than other reasons.

I don’t hate the taste, but I don’t find it particularly appealing either.

Most importantly, never in my life have I felt anything close to caffeine rush, hence the lack of appeal for the energizing factor.

On the other hand I see people craving coffee for either taste or energy (or both) and I just don’t get it.

If anyone feels the same or has some explanation, please share.",1,1756979814.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

The only downside is that it quite limited on what you can list down as a drink, the only options are water, tea, coffee and juice, and I cant put in remarks.

Kingrinder K6
OXO Compact Cold Brew
AeroPress 
Tetsu Kasuya V60
Hario Polaris

I started with V60, but later on I tried to do cold brew using both AeroPress and a Mason jar, and I really liked the latter more. So I ordered the OXO. 

My original recipe with the Mason was 60 clicks on a K6, 1:6 ratio, 2g of water absorbed per gram. So 64g of coffee to 384g of water, yielded 256g of coffee. (Steeped for 12hrs, using ~23c filtered water). This came out as really smooth and highlighted the berry sweetness of the Ethiopia Koke Shalaye really well, with nearly no sourness/bitterness (once diluted, 1:2).

I tried the OXO and went a little coarser @ 95 clicks for 16hrs, but this time 1:4. It was really sour and 'berry' bright with both 1:2 and 1:3 concentrate to water/milk. So I tried again, but this time @ 90 clicks for 15hrs. It's a little better and more balanced but there is still that sourness, but progress.

One other thing is I was shocked that the coffee yield was significantly less (50g to 200g). So I was thinking my grind settings don't match my steep times:

First round @ 95, 16h: 73g
Second round @ 90, 15h: 45g ☠️ (had to work for this one)

Do you have any tips/suggestions/affirmations/critiques? I am still enjoying it very much but thought I'd ask here. Thank you! ☕

* Bloom: 2–3 pulses of hot water, then turned the machine off for \~45s
* Turned the machine back on, waited a few pulses, broke the crust with a spoon
* Clamped the Drip Assist in and let the rest of the water run

**Observations:**

* Noticeably less turbulence
* Very flat coffee bed afterwards
* No clogging (probably because of reduced agitation)
* Taste was *really* nice – though I didn’t do a direct side-by-side without the Drip Assist

**Notes:**  
It doesn’t sit perfectly on top of the Moccamaster basket – a bit fiddly at first, but once it’s wedged in, it holds securely.

**Conclusion:**  
Super tasty cup, and honestly fun to watch the machine drip through the gadget. Whether it’s really necessary or just overengineered is up to you!",3,1756978398.0,pourover,1,0.8,False

I have been together with my partner for about 8 years now we have a 8 year old together who we both love dearly. I have always had a job my whole life I always loved to save money and watch the money I earned grow and I was taught only buy the things you can afford and really need if I really want something save for it and buy it myself. My family was never rich but most things we did not live without or we would live without and move on no big deal. When I was young I got used to being told no I can't have something so I feel now I am used to not asking for things I want most of the time. I also felt more uncomfortable with spending money unless I had to when I got older like when I lived with my mother I paid for rent and my phone bill and some of my food after graduating high school. When I tried to go to community college I lived with my dad and same deal I would pay for my portion of rent pay my phone bill and if I wasn't helping cook I would buy my own food.

       I would like to think my partner was raised the same way his parents are not rich but not bad off either if he wanted something he would have to earn it but he has no problem spending money or asking people he knows to get things for him. When we first met and were only dating he got a small part time job and I let him spend his money on whatever he wanted because I was handling the rent to my dad we were living with for a short time because soon after we decided we wanted to find a place together so we found a small one bedroom and moved in on our own we were both working and split the bills evenly until we found out I was pregnant after a trip we went on.  

Shortly after our child was born and I went back to work he lost his job. So I would pick up more hours at work he would stay home/ look for a new job. while my extra hours barley covered the bills my partner would do what he could to bring in money but he would still insist he buys little treats and sometimes would ask me if we could afford to eat out or buy a new game for his console so I would end up doing the math to find out where we were at and in the beginning this was fine I was happy to get us things like food we loved to eat or shakes and coffee we don't normally get on the regular it made him happy so it made me happy. But the months grew longer I was working more and he still did not have a job he would job hop three times within the timespan of four years. Luckily I am very loyal naturally I had no problem keeping my jobs for three to four years at a time and each job in left for offered more money so it helped us stay afloat for a while but I was always stressing over not seeing our money grow anymore. 

At about 6years into our relationship we both hit our boiling point I told my partner if he did not get more hours at his last job I would suck it up and get a second job we had a couple 24hour places I could apply for. He knew how tired and stressed and how hard working I was and refused to let me go through with my plans. That night after arguing with him we had dinner and went to bed. I wanted to save money to move us into a two bedroom apartment so our child could have their own room and so I could sleep with my partner again. we haven't slept in the same room in five years our child and I would sleep in the living room and he would sleep in the main room so he could find a job at late night shifts while we slept so for a while we would switch off watching our child while the other went to work and we could have dinner together but that was it. 

Every tax return we made at the beginning of the year I told him I wanted to move but he wanted a computer or a new game he was and we needed a big fix to the car and still pay bills waiting for.on top of all of this he kept a few bad habits that would keep our money down but he would keep spending and asking if we could afford it and assure me when he finds a better job or we could wait for the next tax return to save and move. It never happened we ended up so stressed I told him to cut down on spending on his habits and for a while he did he could not buy video games unless they were $10 or less we stopped eating out we both know how to cook we were just tired of dishes and cooking all the time so it was easy to talk me into ordering food a lot.

 I told him he needed to cut down on drinking alcohol and energy drinks and vaping and he did but I should have realized he should not have been doing all three before it was too late. He was drinking alcohol for painkillers he was vaping cause he quit smoking since he was young and he was drinking a 6pack of energy drinks because he didn't sleep at night and barley slept during the day. It got to the point he landed himself in the hospital we almost lost him if I did not find him when I did he would have died. It took four months to get him back home to us.

 I never left his side and our family came together to help for a couple months hoping he would pull through when he came to after his brain surgery he was more impulsive all he wanted was to leave the hospital so he could eat drink and do whatever he wanted again. All the doctors could do was warn and advise against restarting any of the habits that caused his brain bleed. Now he can't use one side of his arm and leg he cannot walk yet we are hoping his function will come back but he won't give his brain and body the time to heal. He argues that the doctors don't know what they are telling him because they can't tell him exactly why he had a stroke the tests don't point to anything specific as to why. 

He won't stop asking me to buy him things he wants beer he wants to vape again he wants to smoke weed but I keep telling him if he does he will die and Idk what I would do without him he is wearing on me the doctors tell me the only way he is going to get those things is if I enable him and they are right but that doesn't put me in a great spot. He is angry and confused as to why I won't get him these things anymore and I have tried replacing them we have tried non alcoholic beer they taste awful. I tried getting him edibals he could take instead of smoking but the THC has caused seizures recently we have had three extra hospital trips and now he is on ani seizure meds on top of blood thinners mussle relaxer and a blood clot filter in his body. I want to help him he has always had back pain he has gone to doctors no one can find out why and we could not afford surgery if it was a option. Before the alcohol and weed he would take up to 8 Ibuprofen or Tylenol but it never worked for him or if it did it was not for long. He is still very loving to me and our child but he is hurt and angry and I am tired and depressed but still trying to keep up a strong front for our child. I don't know what to do I don't want to leave him and I don't want to give him what he wants I told him in time and if we can get him off all his meds maybe he could have a beer but he can't smoke and it does not seem that he will accept this fact and won't believe anyone that it could kill him vaping or weed and alcohol aitah.",1,1756978175.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

I specifically remember that she told me she never gets approached at all and looked a bit flattered that I did. I couldnt stay for long so I told her I needed to go but suggested that we hangout sometime maybe for some coffee and then I got her phone number. She said that I should message her so that she has my number in her phone. About an hour or so afterwards I messaged her to suggest meeting up for coffee in a few days and that she should let me know if she's free. It's thr next day now and she hasn't read my message or responded. Dont know if my number got drowned somewhere in her phone since I'm assuming she hasn't saved it yet.

This is actually the first time I cold approached a girl i found really pretty and would've regretted if I didn't since I usually back out when I do see a pretty girl. Im glad I approached her and got the number. Even the Barista noticed what I did and asked me if I scored:)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

When I first got my BC I did not crate train her, I gave her high praise when she went to the toilet outside, and gently redirected when she went inside.

Problem is, she seems to have learned that it is fine to go inside if she has an urge. If I turn my eye for a second and she isn’t at my feet, I will go and find poo or wee somewhere. 

Because of that I am now crate training her: any time I am not directly training/playing/interacting with her she goes in her crate so she can’t be unsupervised inside. (Outside she can be unsupervised to a degree).

She can hold it overnight in the crate and doesn’t mind being in there, but if I am making a coffee or something and look away, she is still going inside. She isn’t asking me to go outside in any way, she just does her business inside.

I’m getting quite fed up with cleaning the house every day or so and she’s 5 months old now. I would have hoped she would scratch at the door or something rather than just go find a spot inside (usually the same spot).

Honestly boka probably works fine for half the price if you're patient. larineco fits the chaos of my life better (gum vs brushing). if you're broke skip this. if you're impatient with disposable income, go for it, or don’t whatever",1,1756977217.0,NaturalBeauty,0,1.0,False

One interesting thing: last week, one client voluntarily gave a really good tip. It made me realize that even small, effort-light projects can turn into meaningful income if approached the right way.

Now, I’m testing a model where I do websites for no upfront charges, just accepting a small voluntary tip, mostly for coffee, after the work is done and the client is fully satisfied.

(Side note, i am the waiter, the server, the dishwasher, the janitor and the takeaway packer. Such is life in glorious Europe. I can't leave right now.) I have one mug of coffee in the morning, which is presumably 100mg, i always eat breakfast. However, i almost never have the luxury of breaks and lunch. I normally get myself an energy water, which contains 320mg of caffeine per bottle. If I don't have time for that i make myself a black coffee after 4pm. If the shift is particularly bad i pop an ibuprofen at 7pm or my body is killing me. I drink as much water as i can allow myself. Problem is, i also don't always have the luxury to drink my energy drink fully. This is why I'm curious about caffeine pills from the pharmacy. I have no issues consuming caffeine in the evening, because as soon as my head touches the pillow I'm a brick hit by a truck.

Some body info, my personal caffeine threshold is 600mg a day, that's when i start to feel a bit spicy. I have inborn low blood pressure, 60/90 is my horm, maybe anemia, I've always been tired, blue and skinny. Possibly have autism/adhd, the patterns are there but we don't have doctors who give a crap about that here.

TL;DR Need someone who actually tried caffeine pills for hard work to tell me if they're better to survive a shift than slowly and inconsistently drinking an energy drink. I really need it. I have 3 consecutive shifts from tomorrow alone.

1n851qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1n851qw/this_might_be_the_best_essay_writing_service_ive/,This Might Be the Best Essay Writing Service I’ve Tried – Deadass,"Okay, so real talk — I was spiraling. I had this annoying Philosophy essay due in 48 hours, the topic was ""Free Will vs Determinism in 21st Century Ethics"" (like??? what even is that), and I’d already procrastinated so hard I could’ve won a medal. At that point, I was Googling random examples and crying into my cold coffee. Reddit being my usual last-resort oracle, I found someone mention **PapersRoo** as the *best essay help* they’ve used.

[**Link here**](https://essay.watch/SMRTZh?type=28)

At first, I figured it was just another sketchy essay writing service with recycled content and broken English. But bro… I was **shook**. I took the leap, made an account, dropped my topic, and *boom* — someone from their team hit me up almost immediately. We chatted about the structure, deadline, formatting, and citations (they were super chill and not robotic at all). I told them I needed 1,500 words, Chicago style, no fluff, and 5 legit sources. They said **no problem** and gave me a quote that wasn’t insane — way better than the $200 scams I’d seen before.

The writer they matched me with knew their stuff. They even asked if I wanted a draft before the final version. I got the paper **a full day early**, it was clean af — citations, original research, and not a single hint of AI or plagiarism. Ran it through Turnitin just to be sure — 100% clean. I'm not even exaggerating when I say I thought they mixed up my order with some professor’s sample essay.

What I *really* liked? They weren’t pushy, prices were actually fair, and they talked to me like a real person. None of that cold bot-like stuff. Honestly felt like I got professional-level ghostwriting without selling my soul.

So yeah, if you're out here *barely hanging on* trying to juggle classes, work, life, and 15 readings a week, **don’t roll the dice on shady services**. Use something **reliable** like [papersroo.com](https://essay.watch/SMRTZh?type=28). It’s the *best writing service* I’ve come across, and trust me — I’ve been burned before (RIP to my $70 and that disaster of a “business case study”).

Moral of the story? If you’re gonna pay for an essay writing service, go with one that actually knows what the hell they’re doing. You’ll save time, stress, and your dignity 😅

I went to work and found out that a ""colleague"" of mine came back from summer break. This colleague is an extremely extroverted person and has been trying to talk to me for a while. He usually asks me about mundane things, like how's work, or about whatever is on my desk. Nobody else does it and neither I talk to other colleagues like that.

I've been in a relationship for 3 yrs and a half now and I'm pretty sure about it - despite most of my intrusive/rOCD thoughts involving it. The ""colleague"" knows about this because I told him somewhen in the past, but I think he's interested in me anyway.

I'm currently dying of anxiety due to him trying to talk to me and I know that this is not a cognitive dissonance: I went to get coffee and he was coming back from the cafeteria. He looked at me and asked: ""are you going to have a coffee?"", I said ""yes"" with the most neutral tone I could use. And then he went: ""oh no, if I knew I would have invited you before"", I was like ""uhh no"", and I basically ran away. Then I moved my stuff to another office (thank god we can do that), like I did for the past months.

I am awaiting my delivery of a Seimans EQ300.

Seimans say that you must use their own brand cleaning and descaling tablets and not to use citric acid or vinegar. Obviously this will just become pricey over time. Seimans also say to replace the water filter every TWO MONTHS!! This seems like overkill and will surely rack up the costs and is also rather inconvenient. 

In other people's experience, is all this really necessary. My cynical mind says that it is just a money grab. They say that vinegar and citric acid can wear down seals and components. Surely if you dilute with correct ratios this shouldn't be a problem. 

I understand the importance of maintaining but at the same time are Seimans trying to money grab where they can?

I'd much rather be able to just pick up some citric acid and white vinegar in my local store when needed rather than having to order expensive products online.

Just wondering if anyone has any experience with this? How do you clean your machines? 

Thanks.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Expert Insights for Company Formation in 2025,"What Are the Responsibilities of Directors in a Bahraini Company? Expert Insights for Company Formation in 2025\
Stepping out of the Bahrain Financial Harbour just after a majlis-style meeting, strong Bahraini coffee in hand and the scent of cardamom lingering, I couldn’t help but reflect on how the role of directors in Bahraini companies has quietly, but powerfully, evolved. On that breezy morning, watching the glass towers of Seef District glow under the Gulf sun, I was reminded: the real success of any company formation in Bahrain almost always hinges on its directors—even more so since the 2025 regulatory updates.\
\
“Having helped dozens of companies set up across Bahrain Bay and the Diplomatic Area, I’ve seen firsthand how understanding director responsibilities saves businesses from costly missteps and opens doors that might otherwise stay closed.”\
\
\
Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals.—as a founder, foreign investor, or advisor—knowing the nuanced, updated responsibilities of directors is your single best asset. Whether you’re considering a WLL, BSC(C), or private holding company, this guide offers practical, experience-based clarity, with every step grounded in Bahrain’s dynamic business environment.\
\
Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: New Growth, New Challenges\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. and the latest Forbes Business report, Bahrain’s GDP is projected to grow 4.1% in 2025—outpacing GCC neighbors like Saudi Arabia and the UAE in certain sectors, especially digital finance and logistics. The Economic Development Board (EDB) has cited over $3.4 billion in FDIs in 2024, with even more expected following the 2025 amendments to the Companies Law, which now streamline director appointment and compliance.\
\
Importantly, Bahrain’s government implemented Sijilat e-Gov enhancements in April 2025, allowing directors to digitally sign annual returns—a first in the region, saving weeks on document turnaround!\
\
Modern infrastructure in commercial areas such as Bahrain Bay and the Diplomatic Area, investor-friendly policies, and 100% foreign ownership options (yes, really—read more here) make Bahrain a magnet for entrepreneurs. Yet, corporate governance is where it wins the trust of major international partners.\
However, business customs remain rooted in deep local traditions. More than once, I’ve watched international directors stumble by skipping Ramadan business hour adjustments or missing the subtle protocols of a coffee round during board meetings—which can quietly influence decisions more than any formal vote.\
Read the latest Bahrain business news for updates on growth sectors and local trends.\
\
Company Directors in Bahrain: Core Responsibilities Explained\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. to:\
\
Make decisions honestly and in good faith\
Avoid conflicts of interest (disclose any related-party transactions per Article 188)\
Prioritize company benefit over personal gain\
\
Personal aside: Years ago, I sat with a new app startup’s board in Seef. A director’s unreported side-deal nearly tanked their commercial registration. Only swift disclosure—pushed by a careful local adviser—kept the EDB from imposing a BHD 2,000 fine.\
2. Oversight and Strategy\
Directors don’t just attend meetings. They actively:\
\
Set the company’s overall strategy\
Approve annual budgets and significant investments\
Supervise executive management\
\
Some directors make the mistake of rubber-stamping CEO decisions. That’s a shortcut to trouble. Bahrain’s regulators expect active oversight—for instance, ensuring that accounting and internal controls meet international standards. Professional accounting services in Bahrain can support compliance and save directors from legal risk.\
3. Regulatory Compliance: Know the Changing Rules\
2025 brought a big regulatory shift: all companies must submit digital annual returns and director declarations via the Sijilat portal. Directors are personally liable for late or false filings—Penalties can reach BHD 5,000 per violation.\
Key ongoing duties include:\
\
Submitting annual financials and board reports (within 3 months of year-end)\
Keeping statutory registers of directors, shareholders, and UBOs (Ultimate Beneficial Owners)\
Ensuring AML (anti-money laundering) and data privacy compliance\
Overseeing VAT filings and staff registrations with LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority)\
\
Common trap: Many entrepreneurs skip updating their UBO register, which Sijilat cross-checks with the MOICT. I once helped a Bahrain Bay fintech avoid a forced de-registration by quickly preparing compliant disclosures—a few days before the new law deadline.\
4. General Meetings and Board Resolutions\
Directors must convene and document at least one general meeting per year (AGM). The board must approve and record major decisions—new share issues, capital increases, changes in company objectives—through board resolutions. Surprisingly, failure to comply can invalidate share transactions or even expose directors to personal lawsuits from shareholders.\
Insider tip: Schedule AGMs at least two weeks before Ramadan. Board members travel or observe different hours, and the Sijilat system can get clogged with last-minute filings.\
5. Stakeholder Communication and Representation\
Directors act as the company’s face to regulators, banks, and business partners. They:\
\
Represent the company in legal, financial, and contractual matters\
Communicate key decisions to stakeholders and employees\
Uphold the company’s reputation—especially during disputes or investigations\
\
\
One director I worked with would always invite key suppliers to a majlis-style office coffee before contract signings—leading to more favorable payment terms and long-term trust.\
\
6. Risk Management and Ethical Conduct\
Directors must actively set and monitor company risk management frameworks. With rising cybersecurity threats and compliance complexity in 2025, they’re now directly responsible for setting up and updating cybersecurity and data protection policies.\
\
Company Types and Structures in Bahrain: What Changes in Director Duties?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration..\
WLL (With Limited Liability Company)\
\
Minimum 1, maximum 50 shareholders\
Requires at least 1 director (often 2+ for banks/regulated entities)\
Directors’ personal liabilities limited to company assets—unless there’s fraud or gross negligence\
\
BSC (Closed or Public Joint-Stock Company)\
\
Suited for larger ventures and capital-intensive businesses\
Minimum 3 directors—BSC(C) allows private shareholding, BSC (Public) requires a listing on Bahrain Bourse\
Stricter reporting and audit obligations—directors under closer MOICT scrutiny\
\
SPC (Single-Person Company)\
\
Owned and directed by one individual\
Director duties mostly identical, but all decisions and liabilities fall on a single set of shoulders\
\
Foreign Company Branch\
\
Requires a local authorized representative (can act like a director)\
Must comply with all local director duties, even if ultimate management is overseas\
\
Common mistake: Foreign principals sometimes assume their home-country director standards apply. Bahrain’s MOICT requires full local compliance—even if you’re just a ‘branch’.\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: Director Appointment and Day-to-Day Compliance\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation. must be notarized—at the Notary Public Office, Diplomatic Area (lowest wait times: Mondays and Wednesdays 9:30-11:30 am)\
- Upload notarized documents to MOICT portal\
Insider shortcut: Prepare bilingual (Arabic/English) versions to avoid back-and-forth translations—accepted universally in 2025.\
Step 3: Sijilat Registration and Commercial Registration (CR) Issuance\
\
Input director details on Sijilat; ensure names match exactly with passport/ID fields\
Pay registration fees (BHD 180-350 for most company types)\
CR is usually issued within 3-5 business days if documents are complete\
\
My biggest time-saver? Use the new online Sijilat validation check—prevents typos that can delay CR approval by a week or more.\
Step 4: Maintain Ongoing Compliance\
\
Schedule board meetings quarterly (not just annually!)\
Submit digital annual returns via Sijilat within 3 months of year-end\
Keep director and UBO registers updated—review every 6 months\
\
Step 5: Stay Ready for Audits\
\
Engage a local audit/accounting firm for annual reviews (find top services here)\
Secure copies of all minutes, resolutions, and filings—Sijilat now allows digital archiving for 5 years\
\
\
Cost Considerations: Typical Budgets and Where Directors Can Save\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
The real costs for directors? Not just initial setup fees, but ongoing compliance.\
\
Commercial Registration (CR) setup: BHD 180–350\
Annual renewal: BHD 100–250 (depending on business activity)\
Notarization and legal translation per director: BHD 25–50\
Mandatory annual audit (for WLL/BSC): BHD 400–1,200 (shop around for firms with strong Bahrain experience)\
Sijilat annual maintenance: Free (from 2025, but major delays can cost late fees up to BHD 200)\
\
\
Best office locations for fast document processing: Bahrain Financial Harbour (close to most embassies for foreign directors); avoid seafront branches during school hours—parking is much easier after 1:00 pm.\
\
Once, I nearly missed a CR renewal due to a misplaced director signature page. My fix? I now store all director documents in an encrypted cloud folder with version control. It’s saved me at least 5 last-minute dashes to the MOICT.\
\
Legal Compliance: The Unofficial and Official Rules for Directors\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. in companies with more than 10 staff\
- Board minutes: Should include attendance, agenda, resolution text, and director signatures; keep originals on file and upload scanned copies to Sijilat\
Common mistake: Directors sometimes skip board resolution notarization—especially during Ramadan, when notary hours are shortened. Prevention: Pre-sign all major decisions ahead of the holy month.\
Engage a Bahraini compliance officer early. Unofficially, a quick WhatsApp to a seasoned “mandoob” (business fixer) can sometimes resolve a Sijilat glitch faster than any formal complaint.\
Get ongoing compliance support.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Small Customs, Big Impact\
I once attended a board meeting in Seef District where business ground to a halt until the right blend of Arabic coffee was served. Directors exchanged more information (and trust) over the coffee round than during any formal agenda point.\
Unlike the UAE—where meetings move at relentless speed—or Saudi Arabia, with its more hierarchical protocols, Bahrain balances tradition with approachability. Directors who invest in relationship-building (majlis meetings, respectful timing during Ramadan, and observing seniority while greeting) see far fewer compliance headaches and unexpected obstacles. And yes, this really does show up during regulatory site visits: a respectful director is always greeted with a smile at MOICT.\
Tangent: I’ve noticed that even the mood of the Sijilat help desk can shift if you take a moment to ask about the local sports results. This might seem off-topic—but the goodwill generated can speed your application in ways no official escalation ever will.\
\
Post-Formation: Support, Accounting, and Problem-Solving for Directors\
\
Alt text: Professional business support.)\
- Filing VAT and payroll reports\
- Updating licensing and regulatory registrations (especially for new business lines)\
\
For regulated sectors (finance, healthcare), expect quarterly compliance checks.\
\
My recommendation: Use Bahraini consultants who know the real-world ins and outs—not just the letter of the law. They’ll warn you of “unwritten” Sijilat blackouts, embassy holidays, and the quirks of LMRA licensing.\
\
FAQ: Directors’ Questions Answered\
1. Can a foreigner be a director of a Bahraini company?\
Absolutely. Bahrain allows 100% foreign directors and shareholders in most sectors. See the latest list of fully foreign-owned activities. Some regulated activities require local directors or sponsors—details here.\
2. What happens if a director fails to submit annual returns on Sijilat?\
From 2025, digital submissions are mandatory. Late filings can trigger BHD 200–5,000 in fines, CR suspension, or even blacklisting for repeat violations. Avoid the rush: upload documents at least 10 days before deadlines.\
3. How many directors are required for a WLL or BSC?\
\
WLL: At least one director, commonly two\
BSC(C): Minimum three directors\
\
Check details for each company type.\
4. What are typical director fees or compensation in Bahrain?\
Director fees range from BHD 500–5,000/year for small/medium WLLs, up to BHD 40,000+ for listed public companies. Compensation must be approved by shareholders and reported in annual financials.\
5. Can directors be removed or replaced easily?\
Yes, by board or shareholder resolution as specified in the Articles of Association. Notarized resolutions and updated Sijilat filings are required—allow 1–3 business days for MOICT processing. See the step-by-step process.\
\
\
If you want a Bahraini company that not only survives but thrives, invest in your directors. Know their duties, respect the culture, and get the paperwork right the first time. That’s how you stay ahead—whether in Bahrain Financial Harbour or a downtown Manama majlis.\
\

I’ve hit a point in life where I’m just done pretending. I’ve coasted through appearances, online connections, and quick fixes for loneliness — but now that I’ve moved to Laguna and I’m living solo for the first time, I want to be intentional about building something real.

I’m turning 30 soon. Not thrilled with where I’m at, but also not giving up. I want to heal, create, and connect. And maybe build my own little “village” along the way.

**A little about me:**

* Work online (mostly nights), so I’m usually free during the day.
* Practical and grounded, but I love spontaneous adventures (backpacking, random detours, chasing sunsets).
* Movie addict. I'm talking about watching sometimes 3–4 films a day. 🎬
* Big fan of meaningful convos, but also happy just chilling and doing everyday stuff.
* Social drinker but not into clubs.
* Currently exploring Laguna: hikes, nature spots, and underrated coffee shops.
* Not looking for romance — just genuine friendships. (Sa mga lalaki, hands to yourself po tayo. 🙏😂)

**What I’m looking for:**

* Friends I can actually see and hang out with IRL (not just chat online).
* People up for hiking, exploring underrated places, movie nights, or coffee + long convos.
* Anyone else navigating solo living, healing, or just looking for their people.

If this clicks, please send an intro + what resonated most with this post (wag lang “hi,” di ko alam ano isasagot ko dun 😅).

Who knows; maybe we’ll grab a drink, watch a movie, or go on a small adventure. And maybe we’ll build that little village together.

Things started casual — lots of flirty chats, nothing too serious. Eventually, we decided to meet up in person.

Our “dates” were honestly unconventional. Instead of dinner or coffee, we’d sneak around for fun in random spots — like in clubs and (don’t judge me 😂) even a movie theater. The thrill of it was wild, and I thought we were both on the same page.

But then… one day we got caught. It was super awkward — staff noticed us in the theater, and the vibe just crashed instantly. Instead of laughing it off or checking if I was okay, he literally just left. No goodbye, no explanation, nothing. Just vanished.

That was the end of it. No texts after, no closure. Just one of the weirdest “almost-relationships” I’ve had, all thanks to Reddit.",1,1756974552.0,CreepyDatingStories,0,1.0,False

So you’re telling me you can literally get started as an app beta tester with ZERO experience, at home, and get PAID? It's like the internet suddenly glitched and let regular people in on a secret side door of tech money.

Before I did any digging, I seriously thought this stuff was just a scam or those cringey, “take-a-survey-and-get-ripped-off” things. NOPE. The reality is way more interesting, and I’m hyped to share what I found. If you’ve never tested an app for money before, like at all (I sure freakin’ hadn’t), here’s what I learned:

- **You don’t need tech skills or a computer science degree.**
- Most companies BARELY care about your work history. They want **real, normal people** testing how their apps work “in the wild.”
- The key is knowing **where to sign up**, and honestly, I stumbled on a gold mine.

To totally cut the overwhelm, THIS is where I started:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
They make it insanely easy for beginners. Like, it’s wild.

Okay, why is this even a thing?

- Companies are desperately trying to fix app glitches *before* official launch, but they can’t see how normal users think.
- That’s where you step in. You just use the app and give feedback: “This button is weird,” “It crashed!"" “Why is everything in French now?""
- Your feedback = actual gold for these companies. So yeah—they’re willing to pay.

Some LOWKEY perks I was NOT expecting:

- Set your own schedule. Work in PJs. Or in a coffee shop. Or while watching Twitch.
- No stressful interviews, no face-to-face pressure, no commute.
- Get paid via PayPal, gift cards, or straight up deposits.  
Yes, real money, not cryptic “points.”

And yeah, for everyone thinking it’s too good to be true, I grilled the process and signed up on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** myself. So far? Zero regrets.

Here’s what to keep in mind if you wanna try this:

- Start with small apps for easy wins and quick payouts.
- Always read instructions before you test, or you might miss out on $$$.
- Pro tip: Give detailed feedback. The more specific, the more likely you’ll be chosen again.

The more apps you try, the more “experienced” you look. Companies LOVE repeat testers. There’s this wild snowball effect:  
You earn a bit, get better, get MORE offers. (It actually turns into legit side income.)

If you pulled up your phone during this post, honestly, JUST register here:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

And if you’re still doubting it, Google “beta tester real money reddit” and you’ll see people post receipts all day long.

I know for a fact someone reading this is gonna get paid for trying an app this week.  
If it’s you, please come back and brag, because - seriously - we need more of us on the inside.

Remember: the whole thing starts by joining **https://goodnovel.org/testapp.** (Leaving it here for your lazy thumb, LOL.)

Wanna be an early adopter? Now is literally the time to start. And if not now…then who? And if not you…then who!?

Don’t be like past me—shocked, confused, and missing out on $$ just because you didn’t click one link.

The plan is to Uber from Lihue Airpot to the Marriott Wiohai in Koloa and hang out and explore on foot.
Of course we'll go to the beach. Is it good for surfing or snorkeling? We want to have dinner at nearby Brennecke's. We want to know if we can reach Shipwreck Beach from there? Is it safe to  walk the main road to get coffee in the morning? 
Due to long lines we will probably skip Puka Dogs unless we go at a time between the lunch and dinner crowds. What other interesting places can you recommend nearby that are walkable? 
Mahalo in advance!

My husband confirmed he could see it as I didn't trust my line eyes and we timed it so we definitely saw it within the time stated on the test to read results.

Straight after that I've been seeing brown whenever I wipe - nothing on pants/pads but consistently brown when wiping, almost coffee ground-ish sometimes. My period is due tomorrow and I have been getting similar spotting to this before my period for the last couple of cycles.

We are currently away and getting hold of more sensitive tests is impossible and I'm a bit of an emotional wreck at the moment and am worried it was either a false positive or that I've lost it already ",1,1756974226.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

We’ve already managed to train her with the basics but the one thing we’re struggling with is her biting. I know it’s normal for kittens to nip when they’re playful, and that’s definitely the case with her, but what worries me is that she sometimes sneaks up on my feet when I’m sitting on the couch. If I don’t notice her and she suddenly bites, my reflex is to kick, and a couple of times she’s ended up being knocked off the couch. She hasn’t been hurt, thankfully, but it’s scary, especially since we have a coffee table nearby that she could hit. I also feel awful every time it happens because of course I’d never want to hurt her, but if she catches me by surprise, I can’t always control my reflexes.

Whenever she tries to bite, we stop playing and redirect her to toys instead, and we never use our hands for play. I know training takes time and she’ll grow out of it eventually, and most of the time her bites don’t hurt much. But the unexpected attacks on my feet are what really scare me, since I’m afraid I might accidentally hurt her.

I’m after some advice on a cheap, compact espresso set-up. Thinking of something like the Flair since I move a lot between the UK and India, and the kitchen in my Delhi flat doesn’t have much space.

At the moment I’ve got a Melitta Calibra grinder, a Dualit gooseneck kettle and I use them for pour-over and AeroPress. What I miss is being able to pull a proper espresso shot.

I mostly drink black coffee, so milk steaming isn’t important. Would love recommendations that keep things small, portable and on the cheaper side.
