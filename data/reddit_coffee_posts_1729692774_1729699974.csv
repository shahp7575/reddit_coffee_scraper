Consumer goods manufacturers are so creative when it comes to deceiving people. This is a perfect example of how you can find a loophole, a workaround around to NOT MENTION sugar as THE MAIN ingredient! Look at the following list. They created an artificial ingredient called “organic coffee blend”. as you know, all ingredients go in sequence of their portion as percentage of the total package. Since they combined multiple ingredients into one called the blend they artificially pushed sugar down the list. Good job guys! I just drank a ton of sugar.

PS: you also should add “organic” to every single incident that you have so that sugar goes all the way down


Did anyone recognize the brand?


PS2: I used to work as a consultant helping multi billion consumer goods corporation engineer these tactics on a global scale. These companies spend hundreds of millions to come up with a clever packaging, design, branding, marketing, all sort of tricks, just to make sure you stay addicted to sugar and similar stuff.

1gadxb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gadxb5/the_odd_fiasco_of_the_lawn_jockey_and_the/,The Odd Fiasco of the Lawn Jockey and the Butterfly's Wrist,"Lately, I’ve spent all my spare time digging for information about the San Gabriel Racetrack.  It’s a century-old horse track out in the LA suburbs, where I grew up.  It’s not exactly the money-maker it was back during the good old days of horse racing.  But it’s our history.  So the county’s kept it safe from the dozens of development companies who’ve been circling like vultures for decades, eager to get their talons on the valuable land the San Gabriel Racetrack sits on top of.  

For now.

But that protectiveness for the racetrack has waned in recent years.  Everyone I ask thinks horse racing is mildly morally gross at best, grotesquely abusive at worst.  And I believe it wouldn’t take much to convince the powers-that-be to give up and close the track for good.  One disaster would do it.  A cheating scandal, or collapsed bleachers, or a drunken brawl, or really any incident that harms fans or horses.  The racetrack would be inundated with hostile press coverage, public goodwill would fester, and in the end, the track would be sold to the highest bidder to be razed and turned into luxury condos.  

Don’t take your family to the San Gabriel Racetrack.  It’s about to go up in flames.

\*\*\*\*\*

All bartenders like to talk.  Bartenders who work at the theme bars and small clubs of Hollywood Boulevard like to talk, specifically, about all the weird crap they’ve seen.  And if you’ve ever been to Hollywood Boulevard on a Saturday night, you’d know “weird crap” there is a very deep hole. 

I used to be one of them.  I rimmed rocks glasses with black salt and drizzled grenadine to look like blood at Kruger & Meyers, a horror-themed nerd bar between Ivar and Cahuenga.  I told myself when I got hired, a week after college graduation, that bartending at the K&M was a placeholder job, a gap year, a monetary band-aid while I studied for the LSAT and/or applied to business school.  But I liked the job.  I liked the work and my co-workers, and I made great money.  My professional life became an endless stream of costume parties, classic monster movie screenings, and 80’s slasher trivia nights.  In other words - my wildest childhood fantasy made real.  Halloween, every day.  

Next year, I’d promise my parents.  Next year was the year I’d pick a real profession.  Year N+1, to infinity.  

Monday nights, O’Rourke’s Pub threw Industry Nights, specifically for the city’s waiters and dancers and Uber drivers - those of us who hustled all weekend while the rest of the city partied.  I used to attend with my clique of Hollywood Boulevard bartenders, drink Jamo and Ginger, and talk about all the weird crap we’d seen that week. 

Dark nights mid-fall, we’d kick around local urban legends.  Like The Gatsby Clown.  Supposedly, a young blonde thing with a bob and flapper dress used to pace up and down Hollywood Boulevard in flawless, intricately-detailed clown makeup.  Sightings of her occurred between three and five in the morning, after the bars closed and all but the bravest urban wanderers had found their way home.  If you crossed paths with The Gatsby Clown, and you asked politely, she’d describe - in gross, grisly detail - your pending death.  She wouldn’t tell you *when* you’d die.  But, since those who spoke with her tended to vanish shortly afterward, I’d assume the answer to *when* was *soon*.

There’s also the one about the Beast of Cahuenga: a six-foot-long, purple, eight-legged cryptid that looks like a cross between a Gila monster and a cockroach leviathan, sighted in dumpsters on quiet nights.  Or, if you like your bar stories good and bloody, the Vaca Verde Taco Truck.  It’s said to be a front operation for an organ harvesting ring that snatches lone drunks off side streets, chops them up for parts, and grinds the un-sellable organs into taco meat.  

And then, there were the rumors about The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Those were different.  Because The Butterfly’s Wrist was real.

At first glance, The Butterfly’s Wrist didn’t warrant a second.  It was a nondescript little dive bar a couple blocks west of mine, sandwiched between La Cantina Flora (famous for its bottomless frozen margaritas) and Checkers Piano Bar (famous for jazz bands and 25-buck espresso martinis).  The Butterfly’s Wrist didn’t have a theme of its own.  Just a red lamp over the door, tinted windows, and a dirty grey awning, which displayed its name in faded white letters.  The place was never busy, never advertised - no posters, not even a menu board out front - and seemed to exist solely to catch spillover from the cooler, more interesting bars that surrounded it.  

It remained open for nine months, total, from mid-2019 to early 2020. The bartenders at The Butterfly’s Wrist, if they even existed, never socialized with the rest of us.  

The place was just creepy.  So of course, again and again, we found ourselves talking about it.

“Cody said the bathroom there didn’t even have electricity,” Diego told the rest of us.  “He flicked his lighter so he could see what he was doing, and pitch-black hands reached for him out of the mirror.”  Diego took a long sip of his Johnny and soda.  He and Cody were both bartenders at Petal, a little club on Vine that hosted burlesque performances.

“I know Cody,” said Stephanie, who danced at The Pink Cat.  “He microdoses.  I’m a hundred percent sure anything that comes out of his mouth is bullshit.”

“I heard there’s a basement,” Gillian cut in.  “My manager told me they’ve got a sex dungeon down there.”

“He’s right,” said Diego.  “They do the sickest crap you can’t find other places… pup play, piss and shit stuff, girls who’ll drug you and stick needles into your balls…”

Stephanie rolled her eyes.  “Sure.”

Paul, a cook at Checkers Piano Bar, frowned.  “I think they keep animals.  Dogs.  A couple times, I heard dogs barking and going crazy.”

“Didn’t some dude die in that bar?” Floyd asked.  “It was on the news.”

“I think it was outside, on the sidewalk.  Two drunk tourists got into a fight.”

“No, that was a different story,” Floyd insisted.  “Some local rando - an accountant, I think - died inside the bar.  He was shot.”

“I heard he was poisoned!”

“I met a guy who used to work there,” said Matt.  

We shut up and listened.  Matt managed the bar at Stella’s Library; he’d never mentioned knowing a bartender from The Butterfly’s Wrist before.

“It was a couple months ago,” Matt explained.  “Right after The Butterfly’s Wrist opened.  Young guy… his name was Grant, we used to buy cigs from the same liquor store.  He told me they’d had a Bartender Wanted sign in the window.  So he walked in, and whadd’ya know?  The owner was there.  Middle-aged guy with a European accent.  Grant said he lit up a cigarette right in front of him, but he also gave him the job.”

“Is there a basement?” Diego asked.  Stephanie shook her head.

Matt shrugged.  “If there was, Grant never saw it.  He also never saw the owner again.  No manager, no security, he usually worked alone, and he told me he could’ve got away with anything.  Underaged kids, drinking on the job, whatever.  No one there gave a shit what he did.”

Paul raised his glass.  “Perfect gig.”

“I doubt it,” Matt said.  “Grant lasted three weeks.  The tips were crap - the only customers the place attracted were weird loners or drunk frat boys who’d gotten thrown out of the other bars.  But that wasn’t all.  Grant said the bar didn’t feel right.  Like, it had some real twisted juju.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Now, I’d never actually been inside The Butterfly’s Wrist.  The dingy little bar became like wallpaper to me; I’d never been inspired to walk in and check out their tequila selection.  Plenty of better, more welcoming places around for that.

The day before Thanksgiving 2019, I found street parking on Cherokee.  Hours later, after work, I sat in the driver’s seat and texted my wife, Lucy.  We were set to fly to Pittsburgh that night.  My brother attended veterinary school in Pennsylvania; my mom had decided we needed to bring Thanksgiving to him.  

Lucy texted back.  She was tied up at the office and wouldn’t be home for another hour.  I stared up from my phone - and right through the tinted windows of The Butterfly’s Wrist.  A homeless man, dirty and mumbling to himself, crossed the street in front of me.  

I leaned back and closed my eyes.  I’d taken what I thought would be a dead-slow afternoon shift.  But, as it turned out, a lot of people had come into town for the holiday - and those out-of-towners all needed a drink before a long weekend with their families.  I opened my eyes and watched the front of The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Our flight didn’t leave until one in the morning.  I had time to kill.  

Back when I was a naive little lambling in college, I majored in journalism.  I’d buried that career path years before - and the vanishing opportunities, shit pay, and long hours chasing stories around the country with it.  But I’d kept the bordering-on-obsessive curiosity that had drawn me to journalism in the first place. 

With that last Industry Night conversation fresh on my mind, I decided to go for a drink at The Butterfly’s Wrist.

A mechanical bell tinkled as I stepped through the door.  

The Butterfly’s Wrist looked like a stock photo labeled Crappy Dive.  There were a few round, black cocktail tables and high chairs.  A pockmarked wooden bar top surrounded by red stools.  A standard display of liquor: mid-range, nothing too flashy.  One customer sitting at the bar, one bartender behind it.  An average bar, just like a million other bars in Los Angeles.

Well, maybe not.  I looked at the sole customer, blinked, and looked again.  Yep.  It really was him: the homeless guy I’d just seen wandering across the street outside.  Now, he sat at the farthest stool from the door, sipping brown liquor, face obscured by stringy hair and a filthy, oversized camouflage jacket.  

The bartender - a black girl who didn’t look old enough to drink - wore a pink t-shirt and fuzzy pajama bottoms with little red hearts.  When I’d walked in, she was pouring Bailey’s and butterscotch schnapps into a rocks glass.  I assumed the drink was for the homeless guy.  But the bartender replaced the bottles and took a sip herself.  

I sat down on a stool.  The bartender eyed me as though I were an an overly-friendly squirrel.

“Um, can I get a coke?” I asked. 

The girl nodded and, wordlessly, procured a can of coke.  My eyes were drawn to something on a shelf, between bottles of Frangelico and Goldschlager.  

A small, bizarre porcelain figurine.  A woman all in white with a blue skirt, arms raised in a ballerina pose, head cocked.  She had no eyes or nose.  Just comically-oversized pink lips.  A third arm extended from her flank, and wings poked out of her back.  The wings were thin, fragile and lavender, the texture of stained glass.

I stared at the figurine.  The bartender noticed me staring.  She took another sip of her drink.

“It keeps me numb,” she said, indicating her glass.  “I feel it less when I’m a little buzzed.”

The homeless man, suddenly and violently, slammed his fists on the counter.  “Stupid Obama!”  He screamed.  “Obama took my pension!”

I stiffened and jerked towards the door.  The bartender didn’t flinch.

“The pigs took my car!” The man announced.  “They drugged me, and I passed out, and bam!  Pigs all over it, stealing all my clothes, throwing my food on the ground.”

I took a swig of my coke.  The sickly-yellow hanging lights caught the ballerina figurine’s purple glass wing.  

My grip tightened on my can.  

*Screw Pennsylvania,* I thought.  *I’m about to give up a Black Friday shift and a weekend because my mom wants all her children together for Thanksgiving.  Who cares that I have rent to pay and, ya know, responsibilities at work?  It’s not like my job’s* serious *or anything.*

“They’re jealous, because of their limits!  I’m gonna… I’m gonna make a billion dollars, because my mind is limitless!”

I felt my heartbeat quicken, blood pounding in my temples.  *I mean, sure, it would make more sense for Kyle to come home for Thanksgiving.  We all live in LA, he’s the only one out of town.  But he can’t, because he’s in veterinary school, so we’ve all got to go to him.  Because he’s the special little star.  He’s the good one.  Mommy’s favorite.  And I’m the family screw-up*

“I’ve got a brilliant idea… I can’t tell you yet, but it’s gonna make me rich.  Then I’m gonna get my car back, and my pension back!”

The bartender picked up the handle of Bailey’s and poured a couple more shots into her cup.

Thin aluminum crinkled in my grasp.  *I’m not going!  I bet I could make a thousand bucks in tips over the weekend.  Screw my family.  Is my family gonna give me a thousand bucks?* 

I slammed my coke onto the bar.  Cold, fizzy droplets of soda flew into my face.  

“Fuck you!” The homeless guy railed. 

The three-armed ballerina figurine pouted at me, taunting with her puckered lips. 

*I had to get out of there.*  

I dropped a ten onto the bar top, left my destroyed soda can, and ran back to my car.  I threw myself into the driver’s seat.  I closed my eyes.  I breathed.  The virulent rage I’d felt seconds before, sitting by the bar at The Butterfly’s Wrist, dissipated into nothing.  

I had no idea where the intense hostility had come from.  I *wanted* to go to Pennsylvania.  I wanted to spend Thanksgiving with my family, *especially* Kyle.  I was proud of Kyle. 

My phone chirped.  Lucy.  Back at our apartment, packed, and ready to leave for the airport.  

I drove away.  I never entered The Butterfly’s Wrist again.

\*\*\*\*\*

Months after my one and only drink at The Butterfly’s Wrist, Coronavirus washed up stateside.  The state shut down.  The bars shut down.  Lucy and I holed up in our Koreatown apartment: her, working from home; me, baking sourdough and bringing my lady coffee, like the good little sugar baby I’d become.  I collected unemployment.  We didn’t stay six feet apart.

In June, Lucy came down with nausea and flu-like symptoms, freaked out, and high-tailed it to the nearest drive-through Covid testing center.  She tested negative.  We both quarantined for two weeks anyway.  When that was done, I bought her the over-the-counter test we probably should’ve considered in the first place.  That test came up positive.  Lucy was pregnant.  

Those two pink lines accomplished what nearly a decade of my mother’s nagging never could: they ended my infinite gap year.  

It was time.  I’d just turned thirty; my Halloween t-shirt wearing, Bruce Campbell quoting, manic horror dream boy behind the bar schtick was getting stale.  Impending fatherhood became the impetus I needed to leave the late nights, heavy lifting, and pukey drunk-wrangling behind.  I’d long since realized I had no desire to be a lawyer or a finance bro.  Instead, I applied to graduate programs in special education, and decided to attend San Luis Obispo.  Lucy still worked remotely; we were both ready for a change of scenery, so we sublet our apartment and moved north.   

I lost touch with my Hollywood Boulevard bartending buddies.  We still liked each other’s photos on Instagram but, with classes and Lucy’s pre-natal appointments, I barely had time to scroll.  I knew, after Covid, not all the bars re-opened.  One that closed forever: The Butterfly’s Wrist.

We couldn’t blame Covid for that one.

It was a local news item most people missed.  In late February of 2020, with a viral pandemic quickly closing in on the West Coast, it had been easy to scroll right past the LA Times article about the Hollywood dive bar that burned down.

I remember that morning - one of my last days of work, before we shuttered indefinitely.  Flakes of ash settled on my windshield; a grey haze snaked around cars and trees and buildings.  I had to pull a U-turn on Cherokee; two giant LAFD trucks barricaded the intersection, cop cars lined the block, and the sidewalk was cordoned off with yellow police tape.  

I learned, later, the most suspicious of my bartender friends were right: The Butterfly’s Wrist had a basement, accessible via trapdoor, out of which the petty criminal owners ran an illegal gambling parlor and dog-fighting ring.  (Side note: massively screw anyone who engages in dog fighting, no lube.)  That night, a game of blackjack ended with one player… let’s say, displeased by how things went down.  A fight commenced, and that fight became a brawl, and that brawl moved upstairs, and in the metastasizing chaos an electrical heater was knocked over, setting the wallpaper ablaze.  

Four patrons died.  Eight were hospitalized.  At least five men were arrested.  And The Butterfly’s Wrist was a total loss.  

I looked online and found pictures of the wreckage: the charred and splintered bar top and exploded liquor bottles.  I saw - I definitely saw - small bits of white porcelain littered across the floor, and melted purple glass.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Fall semester of 2021, my school reverted to in-person classes.  That was a blessing.  I enjoy sweat pants as much as the next guy, but as anyone who’s ever taken care of a newborn can attest, when you’ve got no reason to leave the apartment, that bubble gets pretty tight. Shaving is the first casualty, then bathing, and from there it’s a downward spiral to vermin-infested oblivion.  

My point is, I was grateful to slide on pants with a zipper, drive to an actual college campus, and have conversations about anything besides breast milk.  I liked my cohort.  Most of them were like me: late twenties or early thirties working schlubs, some with kids, looking for career stability after years spent being *interesting*.  

The most interesting out of all of my classmates was a girl named Greta.  She was about my age, and she worked as a ghost hunter.  Not a ghost hunter like those douchebags with a cable reality show; the way Greta described it, she was more of a ghost therapist.  She’d come in with her bag of crystals and sage and protection spells, make psychic contact with the spirit, and convince it to go into the bright white light.  I asked her how much ghost hunting paid.  She said she didn’t do it for the money, and I translated that as ghost hunting doesn’t pay jack.  

Greta and I weren’t friends.  Our relationship was limited to smiles and small talk.  So I was surprised when, a couple days before Thanksgiving break, she offered to pay for half my gas to LA if she could tag along.  It sounded like a great deal to me.  I’d planned on driving to my parents’ house with little Raven on Wednesday; Lucy had a huge project due for work and desperately needed a quiet night in our apartment alone.  If Greta didn’t mind sharing the backseat with a baby, I told her I’d take her as far as she wanted to go.  

“Hollywood,” she said.  “I have a job there.”

We set off the day before Thanksgiving.  Greta came armed with strange luggage: a knapsack, a rolled-up sleeping bag, and an incredibly creepy figurine in the shape of an old-timey jockey.  The doll was bigger than Raven, and it looked older than Greta and me.  It was made of thick plastic: a little boy with a massively oversized head, a blue jacket and ball cap, pants that had once been white and boots that had once been black.  The color in its eyes had washed out, leaving empty white circles.  Featherlike mildew stains covered its blue jacket and discolored skin.  

I raised my eyebrows at the jockey boy.  Greta didn’t offer an explanation, but she shoved the disturbing thing under the seat and covered hit with her hoodie.  

The first two hours of the three-hour drive were quiet; Raven slept in her carseat, Greta and I stared out our respective windows and appreciated the scenery.  But eventually, I bored of the silence.  And I got curious. 

“This job in Hollywood,” I asked Greta, “what is it?  Like, what sort of spirit are you exorcising?  Little Victorian girl?  Bruce Willis, who doesn’t know he’s dead?”

Greta smiled.  “That reference is, like, twenty years old, dude.”  Her smile faded.  “Actually, I don’t know what exactly I’m doing.”

“Well, who hired you?”

She scrunched her face.  “A guy.  He said his name was Tim.  Our age, maybe, wearing a suit.  He just emailed me out of the blue and asked to meet at Starbucks.”

“And what did he say?”  I pressed.  “Did Tim the Suit inherit a haunted house?”

Greta looked uncomfortable, like she really didn’t want to be having this conversation.  “A haunted business, I think.  Tim said he was working on behalf of a client… he didn’t really specify… he gave me ten thousand dollars.”

That shut me up.

“Ten thousand dollars,” she continued, “and he promised me another ten grand once the job’s done.  I’ve never made so much money in my life.”

“Yeah,” I warned, “but that’s what sex workers say right before they drive out to the boonies to meet the serial killer.”

“It’s not like that!” Greta snapped.  

I didn’t respond.  I got the impression she was trying to convince herself more than me.  

She sighed.  “Okay fine, it’s kind of unsettling.  I’m supposed to go to this abandoned building and spend the night.  Tim said I can do whatever I want… smudging, crystal work, Wicca… so long as I follow two rules.  One: every hour, I need to write a diary entry in a notebook.  And two: I have to bring an old-fashioned lawn jockey.”  

“Hence, Boy Annabelle?” I indicated the creepy figurine under the seat.

She nodded.  “I found him in my grandmother’s garage.”

Greta’s ghost-hunting gig sounded like How To End Up on a True Crime Podcast 101.  But she was an adult, and she swore she was a professional, and well… I had nothing to offer that could compete with twenty grand.  So I kept on driving.  I got off the 101 at Cahuenga.  I turned onto Hollywood Boulevard and stopped at the address Greta had given me.  Then, I realized what that address actually was.  

The burned-out husk between La Cantina Flora and Checkers Piano Bar.  The abandoned wreck that had once been The Butterfly’s Wrist.  

Numbing cold trickled down my spine and my arms and legs.  My fingers tingled.  I felt a warning surge of adrenalin curdle in my veins.  I remembered that night, years before, I’d sat on a barstool, staring at that disturbing ballerina figurine with three arms and purple wings, Hulk-smashing a Coke can while seething in anger.  I turned to Greta, who was gathering her sleeping bag and lawn jockey. 

“Listen…” I started.  “I… I used to work around here.  This place is…weird,” I finished weakly.  

Greta smiled reassuringly.  “Serious.  I’ve slept in a house where a father murdered his whole family.  I’ll be fine.”

I couldn’t think of anything else to say.  And I still didn’t know how to put into words what I’d felt that night, how The Butterfly’s Wrist had invaded my thoughts, twisting and warping them into something grotesque.  So I told her to call me if she needed anything and wished her luck, then watched as she opened the padlocked door with a key and disappeared behind the tinted windows.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Initially, Greta seemed fine.  I texted her Thanksgiving morning; she responded with “job went fine, brother picked me up.”  

Cool.  

She returned to class with the rest of us the following Tuesday.  Her hand was bandaged but, besides that, she appeared no worse for wear.  I didn’t get the impression she was intentionally ignoring me, but she also made no effort to follow up on our conversation in the car, and I didn’t push it.  I hadn’t seen The Butterfly’s Wrist in over two years; bartending on Hollywood Boulevard felt like a distant fever dream, and I’d realized I harbored no desire to relive that part of my life. 

Christmas came and passed.  Final semester began.  I twisted in a hurricane of research papers and projects and student-teaching, and then I was graduating.  We relocated back to Los Angeles.  Lucy got promoted; I found a job at an elementary school in Sylmar.  Raven said her first words and took her first steps.  We discussed a down payment on a house and another baby.  

Then, two weeks ago, Greta called.  She needed to talk.

\*\*\*\*\*

I meet Greta at a Starbucks in Santa Clarita.  I had no idea what was so important she couldn’t just tell me over the phone, let alone required a hike halfway across the state from the North Bay, where she’d moved after graduation.  We made small talk for awhile: she liked her job at a middle school in Santa Rosa; I liked mine with LAUSD.  Finally, I set down my coffee cup, leaned back in my metal chair, and straight-up told her I doubted she’d come all that way to compare notes on IEPs.  

She took a deep breath.  “You remember that place in Hollywood, right?  The one you drove me to on Thanksgiving, a couple years ago?”

I nodded.  The hairs on the back of my neck quivered, but didn’t stand on end. 

“Do you remember that lawn jockey I brought?  And… the guy in the suit?  Tim?  The rules?  I think… what do you know about that place?  The bar?  Because something went into the statue, and they took it out, and…”

“You’re not making sense,” I cut in.  “Yeah, I remember that creepy little lawn jockey.  What about it?”

She sighed.  She tapped at her phone, then handed it to me.  

I stared at a news article about the San Gabriel Racetrack.  They’d done some remodeling and improved the grounds.  The photo showed a little paved road leading to a new VIP betting parlor, lined with mismatched lawn jockeys.  The closest jockey boy figurine to the camera had a mildew-stained blue jacket, an oversized head with fading white eyes, a hairline crack across its cheek, and a jagged hole where its nose should have been.  

“That’s it!” Greta exclaimed.  “That’s the lawn jockey I took to that burned-out bar in Hollywood!”

An uncomfortable warm unease crisscrossed my chest.  But objectively, it was a ridiculous thing for Greta to say.

“Dude, I’m sure there’s a million plastic jockeys like that,” I told her, shaking my head.

“No, it’s the same one!  I’m sure about it.  The nose… the crack…” She fell silent, cocked her head.  “I never told you what happened to me in that place, did I?”

She hadn’t.

\*\*\*\*\*

She said they’d swept the ashes and broken glass out of The Butterfly’s Wrist; cleared the broken furniture.  Other than that, though, the place had barely been touched since the night of the fire.  It was empty, save charred walls and the splintered, blackened bar top.  

Greta had spent the night in dirtier places.  She unrolled her sleeping bag, placed the jockey figurine on the bar top, and drew her personal protection circle with black salt and lavender oil.  She smudged with sage.  She put crystal displays at the four corners of both the bar and the empty, moldy basement below it.  Every hour, as she’d promised Tim the Suit, she wrote a diary entry in her spiral notebook.  She meditated, read her Tarot cards, and smudged again before curling up and falling asleep.

The little girl woke her in the early morning.  She was about ten years old, with short, curly brown hair and a knit, collared button-down dress.  Greta immediately recognized the girl as a spirit, because the cooked white rice she’d placed at her Buddhist altar shriveled up and turned black.  But Greta wasn’t afraid.  She smiled kindly at the ghost-girl and asked her name.

Justyna.  Justyna Mazur, who died in 1943.  

Her father operated a small grocery store in that very spot - the place that would one day become The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Their little two-person family lived in an apartment above the shop.  Her father saved his money.  He didn’t trust banks, so he kept it in a bag.  He saved and saved; he intended to use his accumulated fortune to bring his brothers and their families to California from Nazi-occupied Poland.  

But a group of greedy men heard about Justyna’s father and the bag of money he supposedly kept hidden somewhere in his business.  One night, they forced their way into the store and upstairs to the apartment.  They grabbed Justyna from her bed and put a gun to her head; if her father didn’t hand over the loot, they threatened to kill her.  The gun went off accidentally.  Justyna crumpled to the ground.  Her father, overcome with grief, lunged at the men and wrestled the gun away from them.  He declared they’d never find the treasure they sought.  Then, he fired a bullet into his own temple.  

Greta should’ve kept talking to the girl, she admitted.  She should’ve led her towards that bright white light.  Guided her into eternity.  

But she didn’t.  Because all she could think about was that big bag of money.  She intended to find it for herself.  

In the backyard, she found a shovel and a sharp brick.  She tore apart the walls, pulling off charred wood and digging through the foamy insulation.  She pried up the floorboards.  She beat holes into the walls of the basement and jammed the shovel into the ground until it shattered. 

*It’s all my father’s fault*, she thought.  He’d died of cancer when Greta was nine and left the family with nothing.  *My mother is a worthless idiot*.  Her mother had wasted what little money they did have on alcohol, cigarettes, and falling for a pyramid scheme.  *I’ll show my brother.  When I find that money, I won’t share with him.* 

She tore and smashed and destroyed.  Her muscles ached and her fingers bled.  But she didn’t care.

*My friends are all broke, stupid idiots.  I’m paying too much money for that lousy school.  I know my landlord is going to make up lies to keep my deposit.  The money will be mine, and I’m going to laugh at them all.*  

Tim the Suit arrived at eight o’clock the next morning.  He found Greta in the basement, sifting through shards of shattered concrete flooring.  

Greta regained enough control over herself to feel embarrassed.  Hours earlier, in a fit of rage, she’d tossed the lawn jockey at a wall, cracking its cheek and breaking off its nose.  She’d kept to the rules - she’d written in the spiral notebook once per hour - but her later entries were chickenscratch grievances against her family, friends and classmates, then an unhinged list of all the things she’d buy once she found that money.  

Tim, however, appeared quite pleased.  He thanked Greta, handed her a fat envelope, and asked if she needed him to call her a cab home.  

Greta sat on the curb across the street and waited for her brother to pick her up.  Bits of char and insulation stuck to her hair, she was sweaty and filthy and smelled like must and fire, and her fingers were shredded and oozing and covered in splinters.  But what bothered her the most was the dark, obsessive hole she’d fallen into.  She couldn’t understand.  Outside the burned-out bar, in the bright morning sun, those overwhelming feelings of greed and anger and vengeance seemed alien.

“I’m not like that,” she insisted.  “I don’t make decisions for money… I’m a teacher, for Godsakes.”

“I know what you mean,” I said.

I remembered the night I’d sat in The Butterfly’s Wrist, sipping a coke.  I’d felt what she felt - the fury over losing out on a couple nights’ tips, the rush of ultra-competitiveness, the resentment towards my mom and my brother Kyle.  I recalled the stories I’d heard; all the deaths, rumored and confirmed.  

“I did some research,” Greta continued.  “There was never a grocery store there.  And I couldn’t find a record of any child named Justyna Mazur dying by gunshot.  But… I don’t think that’s the point.”

I didn’t think so, either.  I knew exactly what Greta was trying to say.  I *believed* what Greta was saying.  I just couldn’t put it into words myself.  

“A spirit lived there,” she said.  “I think the spirit… inspires greed and anger and the need to win.  I think I was sent there as a canary.  Or a guinea pig.  I was supposed to rile up the spirit and prove to… whoever it was who hired me… that the spirit worked as advertised.  And I think I trapped the spirit in the lawn jockey.”

I recalled another detail about The Butterfly’s Wrist.  The figurine above the bar: a porcelain dancing girl with three arms, purple wings, and pouting lips.  Smashed to bits the night of the fire.

“You made the spirit portable,” I said to Greta.  “Whoever paid you, they bought themselves a… a haunting to-go.”

\*\*\*\*\*

Greed, obsession, and hyper-competitiveness.  Desirable traits for customers when you’re running an illegal casino.  Or trying to destroy a race track.

I did some research into the 2020 fire at The Butterfly’s Wrist.  Four men died that night.  One was found in the basement, lying in a pit of his own vomit, eyes bulging and lips blue.  He’d been poisoned with cyanide.  The second had been stabbed through both eyes with glass from two separate beer bottles.  The third succumbed to a traumatic brain injury on the floor of the bar.  A fourth man beat him to death with his fists.  He kept on punching after his victim stopped moving, when his knuckles embedded into brain matter, as the bar filled with black smoke.  He’d punched until he keeled over and died.  

The Butterfly’s Wrist was only open for nine months, yet at least six other deaths could be tied to it.  Two tourists from Arizona, who’d mortally injured each other and bled out on the sidewalk.  A bartender shot an accountant in the face after the customer accused him of watering down the vodka. Three TV crewbies, out for a quick beer after work, were admitted to the hospital with hair loss, vomiting, and chest pain a week later.  Within six months, all were dead.  Thallium poisoning.  It was suspected - but never proved - they’d been dosed by jealous co-workers at The Butterfly’s Wrist bar.  

I obsessively Google’d the San Gabriel Racetrack.  An important race is scheduled November 29th.  I also searched for conglomerates that have expressed interest in buying the property.  The largest, and most dogged, is called The Angel City Group: the big doll in a nesting-doll series of shell corporations.  If I were a betting man, I’d bet money Tim the Suit works for them.

Greta and I agreed there wasn’t much we could do.  What were our options?  Call the police?  Report a greed ghost masquerading as a little girl, trapped in a moldy old lawn jockey on the San Gabriel Racetrack grounds?

Well, I need another option.  Desperately.

Because my brother Kyle, the veterinary resident, called last week.  He’s been offered the coolest opportunity ever: a chance to look after the horses at the San Gabriel Racetrack. Better yet, he got our whole family tickets to watch the race.  Lucy’s excited.  And Raven can’t wait to see the ponies.",1,1729698776.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1gadx90,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1gadx90/balcony_help/,Balcony Help! ,"Hi! I’ve had my rescue cat (a senior tortie) for about 3 years now. Shes been a completely indoor cat since I’ve had her, but was a feral cat for years before. She’s on flea and tick preventative but since rescuing her, she hasn’t been outside once. 

I’ve recently moved into a lovely new third floor apartment with a fantastic balcony. Our weather is great and I would really love to spend my mornings drinking my coffee out on the balcony with my cat. Only problem is, I have a lot of anxiety around allowing her on the balcony. How do I know she won’t jump? Shes ~well nourished~ so I don’t believe she can fit through the railings but I would never forgive myself if something happened to her. Shes my best friend :’) 

Obviously all balcony time would be closely supervised but I would love to have her get some fresh air in her golden years. 

Does anyone know how I can safely give this a test run? I’ve considered putting a net up as well but unsure how my apartment management company would react.

Gusto ko na po magpahinga... Ubos na ubos na po ako.

1. Ako ang nagbibigay lagi ng baon sa bunso kong kapatid for school niya. Then nung kasal ng isang kapatid ko this October, sabi ko tutulong ako sa ibang needs nila as a gift ko na rin ba sakanila, di ko inexpect na tutal ako naman ang magbabayad, binonggahan nila to the point na ang laki ng expenses. Na no choice na ko at inisip ko nalang para sa happiness ng kapatid ko kahit pati savings ko nagalaw para sa kasal nila. Then this month naospital din nanay namin, may hmo naman siya, pero mostly ng cash na need and sa meds, galing din sa bulsa ko. Nilapit ko concern ko sa ibang kapatid ko and relatives, 'ATE' daw ako so dapat unawain ko nalang daw yung sa demands and needs. 

2. Ang hirap ng ako nalang lagi bumubuhat sa relationship namin, currently ldr kami ng bf ko and sobrang emotionally unavailable niya sakin. Super invalidated na nga ko, pag may nilalapit pa kong concern sakanya regarding sa mga sa mga kinikilos orginagawa nya, sinasabi nya na ang hilig ko daw sya pag hinalaan at nag ooverthink daw ako lagi. Asan na yung taong minahal ako at mahal ako na akala ko magiging safe space namin ang isa't-isa, pag siya may nagagawang mali, super forgiving ako and understanding, pero ako lagi nalang 'ANO NANAMAN' or 'ANG HIRAP KASI SAYO OVERTHINKER KA'. Pag may problema sya, ititigil ko lahat  ng ginagawa ko para makinig at iassist sya. Pero pag ako na nanghihingi ng oras, parang ang damot damot nya. Pero ayaw ako hiwalayan, ayaw daw ako mawala. Tanda ko pa sa isip ko, ang last time na kinamusta nya ko para tanungin ang nangyari sa araw ko ay JULY pa. Asan ang concern at pagmamahal don?

3. Yung mga tropa ko pag need ng kausap, g ako lagi. Punta sa bar para mag inom dahil may broken hearted? G! Coffee date para mag rant kayo? G! Need niyo ng pera? G! Need niyo ng kasama kahit madaling araw? G! Need niyo ng mag drive para sainyo? G! Pero taragis lang, nung ako na yung sirang sira ang mental health, lumapit ako sainyo, kahit sabi ko sa call lang or sa video chat if pwede may makinig lang sakin kahit sandali, busy na kayo? Pasensya na kasi may problema din kayo? Ako ba walang problema nung nandiyan ako sa tabi nyo? 

4. Sa office, di ko sinasadyang maging importanteng tao, ngayon parang di na makakilos yung mga tao pag wala ako. Naka vacation leave ako, tatawagan ako o kaya pauulanan ng dms at emails. Nasa ospital na ko, kita niyo na naka confine, hinahanapan niyo parin ako ng documents at reports. Nung namatayan ako ng tiyuhin, ano sabi niyo? Kailan ako babalik sa office? 

  
Gusto ko na maging mabait at maasahan na anak, gf, kaibigan, at katrabaho sa kanila. Lahat naman ng sinsasbi iyo halos gawin ko na. Ano pa ba kulang? Takteng yan, sagad na sagad na po ako. Yung stress ko physically ko nang nararamdaman. Super sakit na lagi ng dibdib ko at hinihika ako, naglalagas yung buhok ko, yung tulog ko maswerte na pag umabot ng 3hrs. Kasi di na ko makatulog sa dami ng nasa isip ko at pinoproblema ko. Gusto ko na lang mawala forever. Iniisip ko kung deserve ko ba 'to, kasi wala naman akong maalala na ginawan ko ng masama or mali.

1gadvwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1gadvwr/diagnosis_for_narcolepsy_is_taking_too_long_and/,diagnosis for narcolepsy is taking too long and im having trouble staying awake during 2+ hour lectures even with meds & caffeine,"So I am undiagnosed but am nearly certain I have narcolepsy. And before anyone says, I have read the rules/pinned posts and I have began seeking assessment. Now that this is out of the way, I want to share my journey to attempting to get an appointment for MSLT and PSG, as well as ask for some advice or something.

About a year or two ago, I started noticing an increase in the symptoms I have always had. No matter HOW MUCH SLEEP I GET, I am always falling asleep. I can fall asleep so easily. Less than 5 minutes and I am out for the count, noise doesn't bother me, and I can nap for 20 minutes and wake up feeling like a new person. At first, I was in undergrad and had maybe a couple 3 hour labs and lectures where it really affected me, but for the usual 50 minute or 1 hour class, I was fine. Then grad school came and we never have lectures less than two hours, most of the time they are 3-4 hours each, sometimes 3 classes a day. I was a A/B student, never got anything below a B in college and graduated with a 3.87 GPA, participated in several extracurriculars, and now I am nearly failing a couple of classes because I simply cannot stay awake. Ive tried everything. Stopped caffeine altogether for a few weeks, tried multiple cups of coffee a day, tried teas instead of coffee, got put on amphetamine XR 20 mg for my ADD, tried adjusting my sleep schedule, napping at lunch...nothing. Nothing seems to help. Also I eat decently good, nothing crazy, and exercise when I have time. I only drink water and coffee at the moment, and only drink like once a month if that.

So last year I learned about narcolepsy and went to my PCP. She prescribed me an at-home sleep study, which came back that I do snore occasionally, but that's all it said. I didn't know at the time that you couldn't get a diagnosis of narcolepsy from an at-home sleep test, so I just carried on and figured it was depression or stress or something from school. Fast forward to this year and I learned that it wasn't normal to get 7-8n hours of sleep, take 20mg of adderall, drink two cups of coffee, and then start falling asleep as soon as I am warm and comfy. I also learned it wasn't normal for your eyes to literally start to cross and eyelids physically close whenever I am in class, driving, studying, reading, etc. So I started researching and found out about the tests you need to diagnose narcolepsy and now I feel stupid for letting the PCP just assume I was fine with all of these symptoms.

Last month: I started with a new PCP and she referred me to a sleep specialist, which couldn't see me for a month. My appointment with the ""sleep specialist"" which was actually an APRN in pulmonology, was last week. She saw me for 15 minutes and said I probably just have sleep apnea, which is possible considering my whole family has it and it can be genetic. But she went ahead and scheduled me for a normal sleep study for sleep apnea. She said I would have to be diagnosed with and treated for sleep apnea with a CPAP before they can even schedule me for a MSLT.

I am so frustrated because my life is on the line with Grad School and I can't afford to keep falling asleep during lectures. They're all recorded for our use, but I just simply cannot afford to rewatch every single lecture I fall asleep during. Im in class 8-5 every day through the week and I don't have the time to rewatch and study all of the material. But I don't know what else to do. Does anyone have any tips on how to speed up this process or would be willing to share their experience with getting diagnosed?

ALSO, I have anxiety and ADD so I have some accommodations for my exams already, including extra time and taking the exams in a room by myself. This helps a ton for exams, but my lectures are the main problem. What accommodations through your schools disability center helps the most?

another question: I don't have cataplexy so I think its probably type 2, unless you count my eyes crossing and closing on their own as cataplexy?

TLDR; diagnosis for narcolepsy is taking too long and im having trouble staying awake during 2+ hour lectures even with medication and caffeine. How do I cope?",2,1729698681.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

1gadpy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionwriting/comments/1gadpy1/for_amelia_an_obsession/,For Amelia - An Obsession ,"(Looking for feedback on a new story I have started)

The apartment was my sanctuary, my control room. It overlooked her building, a silent sentinel watching over Amelia's every move. From this vantage point, I was a god, orchestrating the symphony of her life without her ever knowing. It was a distance that I cherished, a necessary buffer between my obsession and the potential for disruption.

Each day was a meticulously crafted ritual, a dance of precision and surveillance. My mornings began with a thorough review of Amelia's daily schedule, a document I had painstakingly pieced together from fragments of information gleaned from her social media accounts, the local newspaper, and my own surreptitious observations. I knew her work hours, her lunch breaks, her grocery shopping trips, even the times she walked her dog.  I was a ghost in her life, a shadow that followed her, unseen, unheard, yet omnipresent.

My arsenal was not one of violence, but of technology, each tool a testament to my dedication to understanding Amelia. My apartment housed an array of surveillance equipment, from discreet cameras with high-resolution lenses to sophisticated audio recording devices.  The walls were covered in a network of cables, connecting my devices to a central control panel where I could observe and record Amelia's every move, every utterance.

I became a master of the digital world, using every available resource to map her life. I tracked her online activity, her social interactions, her emails. My meticulously crafted spreadsheets contained a detailed record of her every phone call, every text message, every online purchase. Each piece of information was a jigsaw puzzle piece, slowly revealing the intricate patterns of her life.

But my obsession extended beyond the digital realm. I ventured out into the real world, a silent observer lurking in the shadows. I watched her from afar, blending into the crowd, observing her interactions with others. I knew the rhythm of her footsteps, the way she smiled, the way she held her head.  My notes became a chronicle of her life, filled with intimate details I’d collected from my silent observations. Each entry was a testament to the depth of my obsession, a testament to the power she held over me.

My fascination with Amelia wasn't solely about her beauty, though her captivating smile and mesmerizing eyes drew me in like a moth to a flame. It was her intelligence, her wit, her independent spirit that truly captivated me. I admired her strength, her ability to navigate the world on her own terms, yet I felt a profound need to protect her, to guide her away from what I perceived as her inevitable mistakes.

My love for Amelia was a dark, possessive force. I was convinced that I understood her better than she understood herself, that I saw the world in ways she never could.  I became her self-appointed guardian, her unseen protector, her confidante, her lover.  I justified my actions, believing that I was acting in her best interests. I was saving her from the world, from herself, from the inevitable pain that I believed would come her way.

My love was a twisted, possessive thing.  A love that could not tolerate the possibility of another man touching her, claiming her attention, stealing her away from me. Mark, with his effortless charm and confident smile, represented the very threat I could not abide. He was an intrusion, a stain on the pristine canvas of my carefully crafted world.

I convinced myself that I understood her better than anyone else, that I knew her desires, her fears, her hidden truths. I saw her potential, the brilliance that was obscured by the limitations of her social circle.  My obsession, I told myself, was a noble pursuit, an attempt to guide her toward a brighter future, a future I had meticulously planned for her.

In my distorted mind, each act of manipulation, each subtle push and pull, was a step toward her liberation. I removed her from the frivolous parties she attended, the shallow gatherings that I deemed beneath her intellect. I controlled her phone, her social media accounts, filtering her interactions, protecting her from what I considered to be harmful influences.

I was the architect of her destiny, the unseen hand guiding her through a carefully constructed maze. I believed that I was saving her from a life of mediocrity, a life that I, in my arrogance, deemed unworthy of her brilliance.  But with each act of control, the line between love and obsession blurred. My reasoning became a twisted echo of the truth, a distorted reflection of reality.

I brushed aside the growing unease in my heart, the nagging doubt that whispered in the darkest corners of my mind.  ""I am only protecting her,"" I would reassure myself, ""She will thank me later, she will see the truth behind my actions.""

But the truth was a beast, lurking in the shadows, growing stronger with each passing day.  It manifested in my sleepless nights, in the paranoia that gripped me, in the endless stream of scenarios I played out in my mind.  The fear of losing her, the fear of her choosing him, the fear that my meticulously crafted world was crumbling around me, was a constant, suffocating presence.

The fear was a constant companion, gnawing at the edges of my sanity. It whispered insidious doubts, twisting my perception of reality. Every interaction she had, every casual conversation, every glance shared with another soul, was a potential threat, a sign of her slipping away from my grasp.

I began to see enemies everywhere. The barista at her favorite coffee shop, the coworker who walked her to her car, the seemingly innocuous delivery man who left a package at her door - each became a potential rival in my warped mind. The lines between reality and my feverish delusion began to blur, and the shadows of suspicion stretched across every aspect of my life.

My isolation deepened. The world outside my apartment walls faded into a hazy backdrop, devoid of meaning or relevance. My phone, once a tool for communication, now served as a conduit for my obsession, a lifeline to the virtual world where I could track her every move.

My social life, once vibrant, withered away. Friends and family became distant figures in a fading memory, their concerns and affections lost in the overwhelming tide of my obsession. My world had become a prison of my own creation, a solitary fortress built on the foundations of possessiveness and fear.

Sleep offered no respite. My dreams were haunted by visions of Amelia with Mark, their laughter a mocking echo in the stillness of the night. I would wake in a cold sweat, my heart pounding against my ribs, the weight of my obsession crushing me.

The fear was a constant companion, an unwelcome guest in my mind, whispering insidious doubts in my ear. It made me see conspiracies in every interaction, hear whispers of betrayal in every conversation. I was trapped in a spiral of paranoia, a victim of my own twisted desires.

My actions became increasingly erratic, fueled by the frantic need to protect my fragile illusion. I would follow her, a silent shadow in the anonymity of the city, my heart pounding in my chest with every turn, every glance. I’d leave cryptic notes, whispered confessions of love and warnings of danger, hoping to sway her, to make her see my love as the only salvation.

The world, once a source of beauty and inspiration, now felt like a stage set for a horror show.  Amelia's laughter was no longer a melody to my ears, but a mocking reminder of my powerlessness. Her touch, once a dream I yearned for, now felt like a poisoned chalice, a reminder of the life that was slipping through my fingers.

The fear was a monster, feeding on my desperation, driving me further into the abyss of my obsession. It whispered that I was losing her, that Mark was slowly stealing her away. Each day, the fear grew, twisting my mind, blurring the lines between reality and delusion.

I was a captive in my own mind, a prisoner of my own creation. The world had become a warped reflection, distorted by the lens of my obsession. And in this twisted reality, the only thing that mattered was keeping Amelia safe, from herself, from Mark, and from the world that I perceived as a threat to our fragile bond.

For example, she will be planning to go to a yoga class and she'll text me, ""Hey, I'm going to the yoga class at 5."" I think the implication is that she's inviting me to join, but she doesn't say so. 

And then she sort of treats my invites the same way. For example, I texted her asking if she wanted to meet for coffee at a shop near her house. She said she couldn't but that I should enjoy myself. I wasn't inviting her to tag along, I was inviting her to meet me for the sole purpose of us hanging out.

It bothers me because with her invites, she is putting it on me to know or to ask if she would like me to join her. And with my invites, she is missing the fact that I just want to hang out with her regardless of what we do. If she can't or doesn't want to that's fine, but the way she handles it leaves me feeling like... what I am not exactly sure. Just not great, for some reason. A lot of the time she doesn't even respond or commit, I think because she thinks it's an open invite?

I have to stay long hours even tho I don't have any work . The working hours starts from 11 to 8-9 sometimes Sundays too , no one arrives till 12 and usually waste 1-2 hours in launch at home. Also 15-30 minute for tea/coffee/snacks. I didn't enrolled in other big city as transportation takes a major chunk of time. But in my city itself the working hours are too long. And I have to take 2 permission while leaving one is from big boss and other is from boss. Which takes half hour as they are busy  sometimes . I always leave after other boss permision because he is my principal however a senior today shouted at me that you should take big boss permission before leaving he might scold you for this ! I never talked big boss till now and he is too toixc as far as I know. Guys have to do night 12 to morning 6 am shift also  4 pm to 9 pm shift in same day just because big boss is not available in other time .  If someone leaves early they have to go through starrings of all articles. Junior articles won't leave unless  atleast one or more than one senior article leave. 

I don't have any work many times but still I have to stay . My senior articles never communicate to me .my boss is unfriendly. My frnds who joined earlier than me have good touch with senior and manager they get plenty of work, however I even don't know how to file return properly ! All people who knows me in firm makes fun of me and takes me for granted everytime. I m late joiner in office.

Big boss is freaking creepy he stares at us whenever we get up from seat . Other boss just pressures a lot for work he everyday ask what you did today . While if I explain things clearly other articles tell me don't be that much free with boss just always say him yes no working . 

If I ask any doubt to seniors some of them tell but they don't tell clearly .  If I try to be friendly with them they ignore me or just answer . However they never get off with comments like "" always ask to bigg Boss before leaving "" starring if I leave early .

1gaddn2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gaddn2,How big of a sectional should I get?,"Looking to upgrade the seating in my living room so it’s better for company. I am sure I want an L-shaped sectional so there’s enough seating for 4+ people and I think it’ll feel cozy. Considering Stanton (I’ve got a chaise sofa from them and I’m very happy with it) since I think Sactional will be more than we want to spend and I’m not sure we’d ever rearrange the pieces, but I will price that one out too since I love the idea of washable. 

Main question is I’m struggling with how big it should be! The room is roughly 144” x 127”; the edge of the gallery wall is 116” from the right corner and the hexagon shelves are 112” from the same corner. I am planning to put some kind of console table or shelf behind the couches so they are 4-6” from the wall. Def won’t do an end table on the right sight, probably won’t on the other one either unless it was very narrow, but I think it would make the corner by the window feel crowded? Might consider those over-arm things depending on how the couch arms are snapped. 

Attached pictures of current space with one couch and a pic of when we briefly had our Stanton couch in the same space during a remodel of the other room. The chaise obviously doesn’t work but I do like the coziness of adjacent furniture so I think a sectional would work nicely. 

Notes:
- center coffee table is for keeps, it is roughly 54” x 36” 
- table in the corner is not staying 
- there will never be a tv or anything in front of the window 
- not planning to keep the orange chair although I may consider an additional chair at some point 
- will definitely be getting a new rug
- I am planning navy blue for the sectional 
- no kids no pets at the moment, although there are definitely dogs in our future (jury’s still out on humans)

1gadady,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1gadady/au_pair_from_purgatory/,Au pair from… purgatory?,"

So, just like many… coming in to share my slightly horror story:

We talked for nearly 2 month by text messages and had 6 individual hour long interviews with this aupair. We talked about food, schedules, her ideas on how she would work with the kids, what activities she would do, how she wanted to spend free time and how she would want to integrate into the family. We had a good rapport and everything seemed fine. We are in the US, so our agency got her to us at the end of September. 

We rented for her a separate apartment in our apartment block, we are limited for space and simply do not have a spare bedroom. The apartment is literally above us, so it is only a flight of stairs to get to the kids and there was no expectation that she will entertain the kids in her space. 

A schedule that we discussed before - 5 days a week 9 hours each, no split schedule, but includes weekends and evening. So basically 11am till 8pm and on the weekends if we are able to get off work sooner we relieve her. She had Tue and Wed fully off. We are in a metropolitan are with really good public transit and tons of stuff to do. 

She did not spend a single day alone the first week. I took a week off work to show her how things should be with the kids, their favorite places, routine, everything… By the end of the first week I hear her bawling her eyes out upstairs. I text her to ask if all is ok. She says, yes. I keep hearing her cry upstairs. 

I reach out to our LLC. She reports that the au pair is stressed that she will be expected to spend 4-6 hours alone even with one kid, but two kids is just unmanageable. My kids are F4 and F8. F8 has school, activities within the walking distance. F4 does not have day care, but has plenty of activities - soccer, dance, music, museum membership. 

I work with her to develop with her a day plan with what she can do with the kids. I refer back to conversations we had over the summer. It turns out she fed questions to chatGPT and read the answers, she has no idea how to implement any of those ideas. She does not know how to engage kids, how to negotiate with them and get them to follow instructions.  

She scoffed at the idea that the kids can help unload the dishwasher, set up the table or help to take out trash. She felt that unless they set straight at the table the kids were not learning, that the activities were too far to walk (max 10 blocks radius from the apartment, max 15 min walk even with the kids walking). 

She cried every night and refused to acknowledge her tears when confronted even when you can see her eyes red. 

The kicker was she complained that we are vegetarian. That was literally the first thing we discussed, and have asked her to try that on her own, as we will not be buying any meat, but will do dairy and eggs for her. She had an option of getting her own meat if she wanted and making meals with produce we already have…

Three weeks in, and only two weeks doing the work she quit and went back home. 

When we went into the apartment to return it back to the landlord she broke several glasses, two lamps, ripped a cabinet door off hinges and have scratched and stained a wooden coffee table. She has not taken her trash in three weeks and the bathroom was a disaster zone….

I really do not know how we could have prevented this disaster. We had hosted four aupairs and this one takes the cake. 

Two others were so good that we still in touch and have visited one this summer…

My symptoms: testicular inflammation (3.5 years, almost resolved by itself now) and RUQ pain for over a year now (also subsided in the past 5 months). But I've also had fatty liver for many years, my ultrasounds came back fine and all my blood tests and liver enzymes are ok, despite mildly elevated ALT.

The other recent symptoms are left temple headache that's daily from 2 months ago and daily thirst for over 5 months. My mouth is dry constantly and my tongue feels like it has the oral hairy leukoplakia feel (it looks like hairs on the surface), although it looks nothing like pictures online and usually resolved with extensive tooth brushing until the next day (coffee seems to make it worse). My HbA1C test is normal, meaning I am not diabetic.

I also have extremely low levels of Vitamin D and recent left shoulder pain when I try to lift my arm (mimicking frozen shoulder). My urine is also foamy for a few months now.

I have positive ANA (autoimmune antibodies), SMA (smooth muscle antibodies, indicative of autoimmune hepatitis). I did an EBV test in December 2023 and while IgG and IgA were normal, IgM came back positive (25.6 (0 - 20), which means current EBV infection?

The weird thing is at the time of the EBV test, I only had the testicular pain and liver pain symptoms and nothing else. But the recent symptoms I have makes me feel it must be EBV despite dismissing the positive IgM value back in December 2023 as it kind of slipped off my radar due to lack of symptoms at the time?  
  
Already been to a rheumatologist post the EBV-positive IgM positive test, but they completely dismissed me without running any blood tests as went there only exhibiting mild RUQ pain, which they couldn't link to my high ANA (1:640) and by that point I had visited a gastroenterologist as well (which could not link my high smooth muscle antibodies to autoimmune hepatitis again due to only having mild RUQ pain and only slightly elevated ALT levels).

Any ideas on what to do next? Google made me really scared after reading about EBV and I really don’t know how to bring all of this to my doctor and what to expect from them.

As we both had a lot of time and lived near each other, we started hanging out a lot. I then got out of a toxic relationship myself so we supported each other. We did stuff like grab coffees, go to some parties, have dinner. He would often help me out with 'boyfriend tasks' like fixing stuff (he offered) and I'd then cook for him so we often joked that he was 'my surrogate bf'. There was nothing romantic about it tho, just banter, no tension whatsoever. We also spoke to each other about our dating lives etc. I knew about his love interests and advised him and encouraged him. I've had a lot of awful experiences with guys (partners and friends) so to me he was really a great guy and I've told him so many times. I always thought he would be a good boyfriend .. for someone else, he's just not my type at all and I've never thought of him in a romantic way. Ofcourse there were some things we didn't agree upon and some things I didn't like about him but that's normal. For example, after his breakup he went on a big self help journey, doing a lot of healing, cutting toxic people and habits out of his life, reading and listening to self help stuff. I had the feeling that this made him think that he was the most knowledgeable about this stuff and he understood everyone. He did have some great insights and advice, but I did kind of feel like he thought he was always right and there was no room for other experiences, opinions, .. Like when talking about women's issues he would often dismiss my opinions as 'That's just Reddit speaking', 'Stuff like that only happens in the US, it would never get as bad here'. And yes, I do get a lot of my information and opinions from subs like these, but that doesn't make them completely invalid? That kind of bothered me. 

Another red or more so pink flag was his choice of women. I've only known him dating Asian women and I had been thinking for a while that it was kinda sus. So as we often had heavy (but friendly!) discussions on topics like these, I brought it up the last time we met so I could understand why he went for these women. First he said the typical stuff like 'If you only date white guys, that's just your preference right?' (I kind of feel like that's a weird argument but I can't explain). Then he said something like Asian women are often just more 'traditional' and stuff like that. So as a mixed race person that kind of gave me the ick and I said something like 'That statement sound a bit incel-ish' and after a bit more back and forth we decided to stop talking about it before the night turned sour. But in no way was there a fight, it was all actually pretty light and friendly. We hugged, said our goodbyes and he went home.

We didn't speak for a few days and today we meet again and he's looking sour. He says he's been very mad at me for a few days and I'm surprised cause I had no fucking clue. The reason was because I had said the 'incel' thing and he thought it was disrespectful and he went on a whole tangent that it made him angry because he's been trying so hard to be a good guy and to hear that from a close friend like me, etc. etc. I tried to explain that I didn't mean to say that HE is an incel but that the statement he made just gave me those vibes a bit. But he just wouldn't accept that. Then he said that the fact that my statement made him so angry made him realise he was too invested and that he wanted to limit the friendship. He felt like he was doing too much for me and that our friendship was hindering him and me from dating more seriously because we already had a friend who fulfilled certain partner roles. I don't think he was saying that he had real feelings for me but that he did feel like he was getting too attached or something while we're not even dating.  That he couldn't throw himself into seriously dating because of this, that it also might scare away any potential partners. I never thought of it like that and have no problems being like this with close friends, but I accept that he can have different boundaries. So anyway, we decided to go low/no contact for a few weeks. I'm not sure if the friendship will ever recover. 

I'm definitely remembering things wrong because it's all a blur but that's the gist of it. I feel very confused and angry and sad at the same time about this. I'm not sure if I am in the wrong? I don't feel like I did anything that offensive? Kind of also feeling gaslit in a way. Could anyone offer their insight on this situation?

Smena godišnjih doba znači i smenu trendova, što utiče na sve, a posebno na modu i enterijer. Razlog zašto mnogi vole jesen leži u onom prijatnom osećaju ušuškanosti, koga nema tokom ostalih godišnjih doba. Zato smo vam pripremili nekoliko **ideja za jesenje osveženje vašeg doma, koje vas neće mnogo koštati**; pa ako smo vas zainteresovali, nastavite da čitate.

Većina nas nema uslova da za svaku sezonu uvodi novine ili renovira svoj dom. Ipak, jesen je vreme kada se dani skraćuju, noći produžavaju, a vi sve više vremena provodite u kući. A da bi vam to vreme što prijatnije proteklo, mogli biste da osvežite svoj dom nekim novim “sitnicama koje život znače”. One ne moraju da budu skupe, mnoge od njih su i besplatne, a biće dovoljne da vam sam pogled na njih donese malo radosti, i prijatnosti.

Kako lišće počinje da menja boju, i priroda nam priređuje svoj jesenji spektakl, tako u radnjama na sve strane počinju da se pojavljuju baršunaste sofe, topla unutrašnja rasveta, raznobojni jastučići i veliki pleteni prekrivači.

# Ima nečeg posebnog u tome…

Ima, zaista. Danci su na tome zasnovali sopstvenu [filozofiju života](https://www.srbijaspace.rs/blog/sta-je-hygge-i-kako-da-od-svog-doma-napravite-mesto-za-uzivanje-1656.html) pod imenom **“hygge”**, što znači “zabavno”; što ih već godinama dovodi na prvo mesto liste najsrećnijih ljudi na svetu. Ako je zaista tako – verovatno nešto stvarno dobro rade, zar ne? U svakom slučaju – vredi pokušati.

Spoljne temperature opadaju zajedno sa lišćem, dani su sve kraći, a vi ušukani u svojoj dnevnoj sobi, uz svetlost sveća, uživate u popodnevnoj kafi ili omiljenom čaju, u krugu porodice, ispred televizora ili uz omiljenu knjigu. I uopšte vas ne zanima kako je napolju, jer vama je divno.

U ovom tekstu fokusiraćemo se na **dva najudobnija dela vašeg doma - dnevnu i spavaću sobu. Jer to su prostori koji nam svima u ovom hladnijem periodu donose najviše radosti**. Pa, hajde da krenemo redom…

# A koje to jesenje boje čine enterijer udobnim?

**Boje su nezaobilazne kada planirate jesenje osvežavanje enterijera. One su prvi faktor koji najavljuje svaku sezonu, pa tako i ovu. Predlažemo vam tople boje koje podsećaju na plamen vatre: narandžasta boja bundeve, grimizno crvena boja ribizle, topla karamel braon.** Inspirativno, zar ne?

Smestite se udobno, uzmite omiljeno piće, i prepustite se maštanju i razmišljanju o paleti toplih boja koje biste mogli da upotrebite prilikom jesenjeg osvežavanja [svog doma](https://www.solis-nekretnine.com/). A ako vam je spavaća soba mala, imamo ideju za vas…

# Inspiracija za jesenje uređenje male spavaće sobe

Počnimo od prostorije u kojoj započinjete dan, dakle – od spavaće sobe. Ove savete možete da primenite na sobe svih veličina, ali pošto je najviše onih malih, fokusiraćemo se upravo na njih.

**Manji prostori ne podnose prenatrpan dekor, zbog čega postoji zabluda da je minimalistički dizajn jedina opcija za spavaće sobe manjih dimenzija.** Ne slažemo se s tim, pa vam zato dajemo tri ideje za dekorisanje malih prostora koje će vašu spavaću sobu pretvoriti u jesenju oazu iz koje nećete želeti da izađete:

**#1. Ukrasite krevet.** Jedna od sitnica u kojima treba uživati ove sezone jeste toplota. Dodajte [baldahin iznad kreveta](https://www.srbijaspace.rs/blog/romanticno-sustanje-baldahina-1504.html). Eksperimentišite s različitim tkaninama, mešajući teksture! Ne brinite ako baldahin ne izgleda savršeno – što boemskije - to bolje, a daće vam osećaj ušuškanosti, romantike i topline.

**#2. Mešanje i kombinovanje tekstura** je podjednako važno koliko i u većim prostorijama. Ključna reč ovde je ""taktilno"" – birajte tkanine koje vam najviše prijaju pod prstima. Posetite prodavnicu kućnih potrepština, i dodirnite svaki uzorak koji vam se svidi. Kupite ono što vam se dopadne, u čemu ćete moći da uživate u zagrljaju mekoće.

**#3. Završite preuređenje sobe mekom,** [**akcentnom rasvetom**](https://www.xenonlight.rs/proizvodi/UNUTRASNJA-RASVETA-65/) koja podseća na svetlost sveća, i pojačajte taj magloviti sjaj.

# Zavese za mračne dane

https://preview.redd.it/5ck0c4h6wiwd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d88c99a7ef394ba5975e73849f3e767f4f6d1c9

**Kvalitetan san u toplom, jesenjem ambijentu je ključan kako biste ojačali imuni sistem tokom prelaznog perioda. Neka vaša spavaća soba bude vaše utočište za beg od svakodnevice. Zavese i teže draperije su jednostavan način da svom prostoru dodate dubinu i mir, ali i da zadržite hladnoću izvan svog doma.**

Deblje zavese, postavljene preko providnih, kako biste filtrirali svetlost, uz dodatak težih draperija, pomoći će vam da sačuvate toplotu. Da li ste znali da zavese mogu da utiču na nivo buke u vašem domu, apsorbujući ili reflektujući zvučne talase? Ovo je posebno važno za spavaće, ali i za dnevne sobe u bučnim [stambenim zgradama](https://www.solis-nekretnine.com/blognekretnine/Sta-je-zgrada-21.html).

# I za kraj – da li se osećate inspirisanim?

Nadamo se da vas je ovaj tekst malo zagrejao, i da ste sada spremni da krenete na zabavno putovanje sezonskog uređenja enterijera. Jesen je godišnje doba, kao stvoreno za to.

**Prošetajte prirodom da biste dobili inspiraciju za uređenje, a možda i doneli kući nešto od prirodnih dekoracija.** Neko lepo lišće koje možete da osušite i držite u vazi, divlje kestenje, poneku šišarku ili lepu grančicu, a možda i neku ukrasnu bundevu. Zašto da ne, prirodne dekoracije su najlepše. Uživajte dok još traju lepi, sunčani dani jer kako kažu – *“jesen je proleće za iskusne”.*

Ako smo vas zainteresovali za jesenje osveženje vašeg doma, podelite sa nama utiske, ili ideju koja vam se posebno dopala, u komentarima. Unapred hvala.

I'm trying to find an animated short that I watched several years ago, possibly in the 2010s. It’s very philosophical and aimed at adults. Here’s what I remember:

* **Style:** The animation was simple, almost poorly drawn, with some real or photographic elements used as montages (like a galaxy and a picture of a person at one point).
* **Plot:** The main character, a human, sits inside a house for the entire short, possibly near a fireplace. They break the fourth wall and speak directly to the viewer, inviting them to drink something like coffee or hot chocolate (not alcohol). They philosophize about the insignificance of the universe and the importance of trust in relationships. At one point, they mention how Stephen Hawking cheated on his wife, reflecting on it, and show images of a galaxy and his wife while discussing how, despite seeming insignificant in the universe, trust remains vital in personal relationships.
* **Tone and Music:** The short is introspective, with soft or sometimes no music, and focuses on deep, reflective conversations. There’s no humor, it’s very serious.
* **Additional info:**
   * I believe it was made for a festival or animation contest.
   * It’s in English, and the character speaks with a clumsy, slurred accent.
   * It might have aired on Adult Swim, but I’m not sure.
   * Afterward, it was adapted into a series, but it was poorly received and quickly canceled.

Does anyone recognize this short? I’d appreciate any help or pointers!

Since we have less than four days, we understand we can't see it all. However, planning has been overwhelming.

Our main objective is to make the best of our and avoid getting stuck and getting overwhelmed with options. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

If you have any ""If you're going to \_\_\_\_\_, be sure to check out \_\_\_\_\_ nearby"" tips, let me know!

**Day 1**

* 5:00 PM: Arrive in Chelsea and check in at the hotel.
* Dinner: Los Tacos No. 1 (either nearby location) for quick dinner.
* Head north to Times Square for shopping and/or a theater show (if available). Aiming for Book of Mormon.

**Day 2**

* Breakfast: Brooklyn Bagel and Coffee
* Head north to the American Museum of Natural History for opening (10:00am).
* Lunch: Looking for a convenient spot nearby (recommendations?).
* 1:30 PM: Considering attending Late Night with Seth Meyers, but it's a four-hour commitment, so we might take the NBC Studio Tour and visit MoMA instead.
* After 5:00 PM: Dinner with relatives.

**Day 3**

* Breakfast: Russ & Daughters
* Head north to the Met for the opening (10:00am).
* Lunch: Open to recommendations.
* 2:00 PM: Radio City Music Hall.
* 4:00 PM: See the Rockefeller rink, then down to Bryant Park Winter Market for dinner options.

**Day 4**

* Morning: Chelsea Market and Chelsea Flea.
* Noon: Return to the hotel to pack and check out.
* 2:00 PM: Airport.

How does this itinerary look to you? I think there's potential to add a few more specific activities, but maybe I'm overdoing it? I’d appreciate any suggestions you might have!

Here are some details to help guide your recommendations:

* We’re food-focused and excited to experience what we can't get at home. Very happy with excellent food, even if it comes wrapped in tinfoil. Not into waiting in line for trendy spots, though.
* We tend to be early risers, not night owls.
* Traveling as a couple, no children.
* Our focus is on enjoying great food, experiencing classic NYC attractions, and getting some early ""Christmas in New York"" vibes.",0,1729696732.0,AskNYC,6,0.4,False

My buddy, Wrensch, and I decided to stick it out and managed to get a few casts in between the gusts. A hopper slapped down hard in the riffle got the first take of the day and we managed to stay busy until something strange happened…

We were quite high up, and I still can’t think it was caused by a human. We were sitting, having coffee, when we noticed a trickle of river running where it had been dry ground moments before. The trickle grew, and by the time we finished our coffee a pool had formed and continued to trickle further “down stream”. Water clarity remained relatively constant, but it was as if the stream was suddenly pushing an extra 100L/second or something. Despite cloud cover we’d not seen any rain, although you never know what’s happening in those kloofs and ravines when the weather gets like it was.

Anyway - the fish went lockjaw on us after that and we were both home for lunch. Good times!",30,1729696554.0,flyfishing,1,1.0,False

1gacxr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gacxr6/struggling_to_choose_between_good_coffee_grinders/,Struggling to choose between good coffee grinders (£249-£565) and scales (£20-£220),"Hello everyone, so I'm kinda new to the proper coffee making. I have a Delonghi Specialista Prestigio series coffee machine (EC9355.M) which I've felt I've been a little bit unlucky with as the computer got stuck in cleaning mode requiring a board replacement within the first year and now just after the warranty ended my grinder isn't really grinding anymore. And as it happens, I've started looking to maybe replace the machine.



So I went down the rabbit hole of seeing what's around and I kind of decided that I didn't want another consumer machine anymore, I dont' wanna waste money on something that I think isn't gonna be reliable. I don't exactly like Delonghi, Breville or Sage brands at all, but that's basically the only brands that make any cheaper machines. So then I've looked at E61 variants. Obviously Rocket Appartamento TCA picked up my interest as I think it looks gorgeous, but realistically even if I got it, I don't know if it's exactly the type of machine I want. I read a lot of opinions about these machines on Reddit and elsewhere, just felt a bit strange that dropping £1600 or anything around that price requires to have the machine warm up for half an hour or more, prior to being used. It's not exactly a big deal for me I saw people using smart plugs, which makes sense and I realistically drink 1 or maybe 2 cups of coffee a day, but It's just something that lingered with me as I was researching coffee machines. I enjoy watching videos of people making coffee manually, turning wheels and knobs etc but I don't know if I'd feel that pleasure 3, 4 or 6 months down the line, when in comparison my current Delonghi (when it isn't partially/completely bricked) warms up the water in seconds and prepares steam in a few seconds after too with a press of a button/turn of a wheel.



Either way, I've decided that whilst the coffee pressing side of the machine still works, maybe it's the perfect time for me to get a proper standalone espresso coffee grinder and just see if maybe my coffee will suddenly taste much better, or maybe I won't be able to tell the difference. Also this would make the coffee making a little bit more manual to get the taste of what it's like when I have to manually do more than just press conveniently places buttons. So again, it's another rabbit hole of trying to decide what is better. Where I stand right now is:

DF54 seems like a good starting point, but as is it's around £249 even though a few months ago it seemed to be £199 and since increased, so it's not exactly AS GOOD of a deal anymore. 

Then we have a bit of a jump into Eureka Mignon Specialita for £369 - seems like a great all around coffee grinder, but it's timer based instead of weight, so now I'd have to either grind coffee multiple times until I get it right (to get those 18g or whatever else) and then basically never touch the settings again, so playing around just kinda becomes a little bit undesirable in my eyes. Or I have to single dose it every time, but then the top bucket holding beans is kinda pointless, I don't want it to be empty on display in my kitchen, so then apparently I could replace it, but again it's just an extra cost that isn't necessarily a must so I probably will just avoid doing that.

So now all those problems are kinda gone if I go for something like Eureka Mignon Libra, which weights those beans and gives me exactly as much as I want, all good except now it's £565 and basically as much as my Delonghi coffee machine was when I purchased it, which seems kinda ridiculous in my eyes. I'm not totally against it, just seems a bit too good for my current skills or setup.

Now, I understand that even though moving from Nescafe Azera Americano about 4-5 years ago, to getting an AeroPress and using nicer freshly grinded beans at a local coffee shop, to using Delonghi beans to cup style machine now, my coffee has improved and since I've tried a lot more beans and switched to almost exclusively drinking lattes instead of Americanos, I was reading up and kinda realised that I've been using the tools that came with the machine and haven't exactly played around or anything with extra accessories. So now my thinking was, I could buy a 51mm bottomless portafilter to help me see if how I'm setting up my grinder and coffee machine is good or not and then buy a manual tamper and buy scales to measure weight and track all these things to make sure I get the best flavour I can. But I kinda quickly buy into the whole hype of other people using specific gadgets to do all these things, so my mind kinda goes if I'm buying Eureka Mignon Specialita, I need good, sensitive and responsive scales, there's a lot of crap on Amazon going for (£20-30) then there's very high-end one that go for £140 (Felicita Arc), some over £200 (Acaia Lunar), so I'm just kinda stuck again because with those prices I might as well just get the grinder by weight, so then it's the whole loop where I just cannot exactly decide what I should get, because it almost seems like I'm either getting a very budget option or a very high-end one.



Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to see if anybody here had any ideas or suggestions for what would be a good setup that would last me awhile in terms of grinders and scales? It's the kind of situation where, I don't really wanna fix my Delonghi machine because I keep living in the limbo where it gets fixed and them I'm counting days until it breaks again even though I don't think it gets used anywhere near enough to justify breaking. And considering the standard portafilter seems to be 58mm, I was always reluctant to buy 51mm accessories and waste money on that when it gets replaced inevitably. But I feel like recently I got my passion reignited and I'd love to have the coffee making a little bit more of a process. Looking at E61 HX machines tickles an inner child inside of me and makes me wanna try harder, but I also understand that a lot of people say it's ""outdated"" in terms of - it's a boiler that needs heating up forever for, which ain't exactly a perfect fit for a home setting compared to commercial spaces before. I don't know If I'm missing something exactly, but my head is a little bit convoluted when everyone has a different opinion with lots of ups and downs as I read anything about coffee and its equipment.",1,1729696298.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I (Sagittarius) met and dated a gentleman (Taurus) for a year.  We are both widowed and decided to take things extremely slow as we are both still raising children (young adults and a teenager).  I had a few butterflies for a short while at the beginning and slipped into the comfortable hanging out and having fun mode.  

After a while his efforts to commit to an already easy going building pace started to dwindle.  For example: We're both still working and committed Friday evenings as our time.  At first we would watch movies, sit and talk for hours in front of a fire,  drive out for coffee or supper.  After some time he started to cut our time short or simply cancel.  Other times he would ask to come over but then arrive like two hours later.  

I felt that he's perhaps too old school and didn't want to or see the need to put in any effort.  He's a very caring, helpful person but seemed to be unable to build and strike emotional intimacy.

After a year I told him that we should rather stop trying to build an intimate relationship.  We're both not into drama so we parted peacefully.   Recently I needed help with home maintenance issues so called on him for help. Being the helpful person that he is, he showed up.

We live in the same area so we'd also run into each other now and then.  Greeting with a hug and having a quick chat is not uncomfortable.

Hoping that's enough background: He's courting style seems to be old schoolish and recently told me that he's waiting for invite to drink coffee at my place, he's missing our late nights talks in front of a cosy fire.  A lady friend suggested that it seems like this is his attempt to get back together.  

If it is, I'm not sure if I want to encourage anything.  While I like him as a person, admire most of his values and enjoy spending time with him, I can't really say that I'm attracted to him.

A part of me thinks that the whole butterflies in the stomach, weak knees and watery eyes isn't really needed at our age.  Instead a solid friendship, camaraderie, respect, love and combined efforts can be enough.

Please tell me what you think?

**Summary:**

It's 1987 London and anti-gay sentiment is on the rise ahead of the government's push to pass Section 28 to prohibited the ""promotion of homosexuality"" by local authorities -- including banning books and education in schools.

Why do Fell, low level government administrator caught up in an environmental corruption scandal, and Crowley, a ""fixer"" for a nefarious consulting company and reluctant queer community organiser, keep running into each other -- quite literally? Is it just romantic fate bringing together two middle aged ""confirmed bachelors"" who thought it was too late to find love, or is there some other connection? Can they figure it out? (Are they sure they want to?)

**Chapter Excerpt:**

Crowley had developed a pretty good mental map of London, so it wasn’t *that* much effort to work out a route that just *happened* to make Angel’s the last stop. They did live *relatively* close to each other. It was *practically* on the way. 

Really, it just made sense that they would find themselves alone in the Bentley, pulling into a spot that just opened up in front of the boarded up, signless shopfront. His uncle’s building, he had said. The only family he had left. It wasn’t much to look at, made even bleaker now knowing some of the back story (and there was more to it, wasn’t there? There was always more…). 

He put her in park and cut the engine, eyes fixed out the front window. Neither of them made a move to open a door. Crowley thought he should… he didn’t really know… apologise? For being mad on Angel’s behalf? Did people do that? Did *he* do that? His fingers curled around the steering wheel in frustration. He was a middle aged man with the emotional resources of a cold cup of coffee. 

He should say something. Something calm and normal. Something that would convince a person that he wasn’t a mess, that he wasn’t a disaster, that he could manage his shit. He was going to be patient and he was going to get a fucking handle on his rampaging emotions. There was a very good reason. Finally, he felt he had a reason to try. He’d been swinging wildly around in dizzying circles for so long but, finally, there was the pull of True North. Now he just had to stay the course. If that were possible for a wreck like him.

1gactsh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gactsh,Windy Cape Stream Session,"Still somewhat windblown after a wild and wooly Sunday on the slopes of Helderberg. My buddy, Wrensch, and I decided to stick it out and managed to get a few casts in between the gusts. A hopper slapped down hard in the riffle got the first take of the day and we managed to stay busy until something strange happened…

We were quite high up, and I still can’t think it was caused by a human. We were sitting, having coffee, when we noticed a trickle of river running where it had been dry ground moments before. The trickle grew, and by the time we finished our coffee a pool had formed and continued to trickle further “down stream”. Water clarity remained relatively constant, but it was as if the stream was suddenly pushing an extra 100L/second or something. Despite cloud cover we’d not seen any rain, although you never know what’s happening in those kloofs and ravines when the weather gets like it was.

Anyway - the fish went lockjaw on us after that and we were both home for lunch. Good times!

As a background, I have dealt with a variety of different chronic pain or weird symptoms for most of my life. Migraines, joint pain, bruising, flu like symptoms, lightheaded, etc. All of which I have never gotten answers from a regular doctor. 

Because of the lack of answers, it has pushed me to go more of a holistic route. I am learning more about my body and nutrition and trying to apply that to my life. 

With all that said, I have started this past week implementing some of those things I have learned. I started doing magnesium foot soaks each night, salt water in the morning, increasing my water intake, lessening my processed sugars, eating more fruit and veggies, and coconut oil in my coffee. 

However, when I first started, I had a lot of insomnia (I deal with this on and off) and weird dreams. Then I started having some intestinal issues (I know tmi--but constipation), and my period is now a week late. Both of those things are pretty abnormal for me to have, as they aren't my normal issues. 

I started getting pain that travels from my back (both sides) to the front of my intestine area, and that has made me think maybe a UTI? I don't know...I am waiting on the Dr to get in and check it out, but I was also wondering if these things could be detox symptoms? or if the changes I have been making would even be big enough TO cause detox? my body is very sensitive to changes, so it would surprise too much if that was the case, but I am kind of in the dark with all of this and not sure what is normal and what isn't.

Now I shower, because the Extreme Divorced Studio I moved into doesn't have a bath. And I usually leave the lights off while I'm in there. Warm water and darkness can be it's own kind of intimate, I suppose. Not really the same though.

I figured this would be the next best place to get some questions answered.

Is Adderall supposed to help with my attention span? I’ve noticed that it helps with my racing thoughts and gives me a bit of a clearer head but I haven’t noticed a change in terms of my attention span. I work in a very chaotic environment and I still feel as though Im getting distracted by each new thing that comes up but I’m not sure if that’s just the work environment.

Can I still drink coffee while taking Adderall? I used to drink a lot of coffee but I’m trying to limit myself now that I’m taking this prescription but I don’t know if I should try to cut it out completely.

How long is Adderall XR supposed to last? My doctor says it’s a 24 hour prescription but it feels like it’s lasting 8 hours at most. I’ve also noticed that there are some days where it feels like it’s working but others where I can’t notice any difference at all.

1gacnvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gacnvk/no_uti_but_the_symptoms_persist_this_was_a/,No UTI but the symptoms persist - this was a chronic problem of mine before but is it back? ,"Patient Info:
33 year old female 

Other formal diagnosis: ADHD, POTS, bile reflux from removal of gall bladder at 16 years old, hammer toes and foot curling that has required surgical intervention and needs it again, selective IgA deficiency 

Noted by geneticist: homozygous MTHFR mutations but homocysteine levels were normal 

Relevant medical history:
From about age 15 through age 25, I was constantly being treated for near-monthly UTIs. I would experience burning urination, frequency urges, back pain, and cramping. On at least 3 occasions, it progressed into a kidney infection and required shots of rocephin. When it was determined to be just a standard UTI, they would first try bactrum or other antibiotics but inevitably it would need ciproflaxin when the first round of antibiotics didn’t resolve it. 

On most occasions, the lab tests confirmed UTI right away. But sometimes it was negative and the doctor would assume it was just not showing because of the most recent round of antibiotics or overhydration or the azo was too dark or whatever but they’d still prescribe the antibiotics. 

On a tangential note - all of these long doses of cipro destroyed by good bacteria, obviously, so I was also in a constant cycle of dealing with bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections. 

At some point, a urogyencologist suggested that I actually had interstitial cystitis and just needed to follow a strict diet to avoid inflaming the urethra. I did avoid the obvious ones (spicy, alcohol, coffee) but I would still have sugar and diet sodas occasionally because it didn’t make sense to me that lab tests could confirm infection if it was just my bladder spasming. But I figured the years of UTIs could have just made it sensitive and both issues were working in tandem. 

Finally at 25 I was seen by a urologist that performed a uroflowmetry test that showed I was retaining in the bladder because the pelvic floor muscles were constricting in appropriately. The doctor had me sit on this electromagnetic chair thing 3x per week for several weeks. I was skeptical but I never had symptoms of UTI after that. Everything vanished. I was so grateful that I cried. The pain finally stopped. 8 beautiful years of peace follow and I was so confident that my problems were gone that I largely forgot about most of it. 

Until last Friday. Suddenly my urine is burning and I feel like I need to go constantly but nothing is there. I’m all too familiar with these symptoms but I’m out of town so I take some Azo and suffer through until Monday. I stop taking azo on Sunday so that it wouldn’t disrupt any test on Monday morning. 

Monday I go to urgent care and Dr. says my urine is totally clean. No signs of infection at all. She says she’ll send for a culture but maybe it’s just a bladder spasm. I did have a sip of a friend’s margarita on Friday so maybe my urethra just really didn’t like that 🤷🏼‍♀️

But it’s Wednesday now and I’ve been dedicated to drinking even more water than I normally do and only bland foods and I’m in so much pain. My urethra is on fire and it feels like I’m going to have an accident from how badly I have to urinate but nothing is there. 

So I’m here to ask: what do I do now? I’m not sure where to even pick back up to try and figure out what the problem is. The dr. that prescribed me the magnet chair isn’t in practice anymore and I can’t even remember what the chair was called. But do I even need to find someone that does what he did? What did I do to bring this back? Could it really be my same old issues coming back? 

*another tangential note: I’ve been convinced that I have some sort of connective tissue problem. My joints have always been painful and often just feel like they’re not in the right place. I complained to doctors in childhood and they dismissed it as growing pains or whatever so I never really brought it up to any specialists or anything. When I was pregnant, it was 10/10 pain from 18 weeks on. Pain was everywhere and so bad that I could barely walk and I genuinely considered suicide. It was excruciating. And doctor just said “you must have more of the hormone relaxin than others so it’s just not holding your joints in place as well. I’ve also seen that POTS and curled toes/feet are often seen in connective tissue disorders. But I know that there is a particular connective tissue disorder that is pretty trendy for teenagers right now and so I hesitate to even tell a doctor my hypothesis.

The cocoa/vanilla/coffee (black label) was too intense for my liking. My conclusion is that the coffee lends too much bitterness to the final mix, and that really dominates vanilla and any flavors from the barrel aging.  The cocoa is there, but the coffee bitterness is too much for my liking, and I love great coffee but this isn't the place for it.  

The orange label one, with only barrel aging, was my choice over the black label. I don't know how long it's barrel aged, but the aging mellows the greenness of the regular Pumpkinator (in the 22 ounce bottles).  This 12 ounce orange label version offers all of the goodness of Pumpkinator but the intense sweetness mellowed a bit.  I did not detect any woody or oak flavor, and it's still a sweet beer but the barrel aging does it well presumably because this third stage barrel fermentation works out more of the sugar and gives the whole beer time to mellow a bit.

Hi, so i am trying to dial in my wilfa uniform for my pour over and being quite new to the whole method i am having some problems figuring out what is correct and how things should look. I thought i give this tool a try but was having some problems finding any reference images of how the resulting histogram and data should best look like. Anyone here has given it a try and feels like sharing some results and data? Or any general recommendation on how to dial in my wilfa uniform? For this analysis i set the grinder to 28 but normally i was trying between 22-26.  
Edit: clearly this was too course of a grind and im going down by 2-3 next time and repeat the image

1gac9qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gac9qv/er_visit/,ER Visit ,"I have been dealing with anxiety for a few months now and it has caused me to change my life completely. I don’t drink coffee anymore, I don’t want to do outings anymore, I don’t find enjoyment in what I used to because I’m worried the anxiety will come up and I’ll associate my hobbies with it. All I seem to do is work and focus on the symptoms of my anxiety or when I’ll have another attack. 

The past two days have been extremely hard for me and I don’t know why. I’ve tried getting into activities again. Some include embroidery, crocheting, going to activities at my church. It just seemed to make me topple over. At least I feel that way. The past two days have brought me nothing but chest pains more than I usually experience. 

Last night I was experiencing the chest pains more frequently and tried to calm myself down. I tried doing all the exercises my counselor has taught me which didn’t work. So, I tried to take a shower to calm myself down. I felt ok in the shower. After that I went to bed and thought I’d lay down and try to relax. I was in bed for about ten minutes when the feeling of impending doom hit me and I could feel a lump in my throat with chest pain coming and going. I instantly jumped up and ran to my husband telling him I didn’t feel good. He tried to do the find the rainbow, box breathing, everything with me but it didn’t work. My heart rate got up to 146 and I started to freak out more. 

Finally, we decided it was best I go to the ER. I got in the car and once we got to the end of the driveway I felt like I was going to pass out or die. I kept begging my husband to drive faster. I rolled my window down and try to breathe while taking in the night air. It helped me calm down a little but my heart was still racing. My husband dropped me off at the front door to the ER because it was crowded. When I walked in I was shaking so bad and crying. The receptionist checked me in and I got triaged to the back. The nurse took my vitals and asked me the intake questions. She performed an EKG in the intake room and said my heart rate was 97 so I was sent back to the waiting room because I wasn’t deemed an emergency anymore. 

I sat in the waiting room with my husband for about an hour until an EMT came to take my blood. This took 30 minutes or longer because I was such a hard stick. I ended up getting the IV at my wrist which scared my husband (later when we were leaving it started pouring blood). Another hour went by and a woman came out and called my name. I stood up and so did my husband but she put her hand in his face and said only her. My husband instantly got worried and I could feel my heart racing. Luckily it was only for an X-ray. Once this was completed I went back into the waiting room. I sat there for another hour until a nurse came and took me to a room. 

When I got into the room he took more blood for the second troponin test and asked me some basic questions and got my vitals which luckily had come back down to normal (HR 76 and BP 106/66). We were in the room for about another hour until the ER doctor came in. He told me that the x-ray, EKG, and bloodwork was absolutely fine but I needed to follow up with my PCP. My troponin never got elevated and he said it was the normal below 2. 

My chest has been so sore since last night and I’m extremely worried about everything. I know this is probably anxiety but I have not had a bad attack like this in two months. It’s like I forgot the feeling of a full blown attack. I’m going to my counselor today and then my doctor right after. I’m hoping I can get a heart monitor or medicine to help. I’ve tried hydroxyzine (as needed), lexapro, and Zoloft but none of them helped. Lexapro gave me extremely bad side effects. Hydroxyzine caused my heart rate to got up. Zoloft caused me to be extremely numb to everything around me. 

Has anyone else had experiences like this? What medications help you? I feel so hopeless and lost. My chest is heavy and feels hollow with spontaneous pains. I don’t feel like myself and I hate this so much. ",1,1729694623.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

**Because what's a meme coin without a few LOLs?**

🎉 Drumroll please! Ikigai just hit another huge milestone today by getting listed on AscendEx! That’s right, folks—we’ve officially leveled up and joined the cool kids' table. This is our first centralized exchange (CEX) listing, and let me tell you, nothing says “we’ve made it” like getting the CEXy stamp of approval! 🚀

But wait, there’s more—oh yes, a lot more. Hold onto your sats because the Ikigai train is speeding ahead, and we’re taking the whole community with us (Lambo optional). Here’s what’s cooking in the Ikigai ecosystem:

💳 **Fiat Buy Option Added**

I know what you’re thinking—“But, how do I get into this whole ‘purpose-driven meme coin’ thing without a PhD in crypto?” Well, great news! We’ve made it easier than explaining crypto to your grandma. You can now buy Ikigai directly with fiat on our website. No more jumping through crypto hoops like you’re auditioning for Cirque du Soleil—just a few clicks, and boom! You’re in. It’s like buying pizza, but instead of pizza, you get purpose (and maybe a Lambo, fingers crossed).

**Transparency? We’ve Got That in Spades!**

You know how most meme coins are like that mysterious neighbor you only see through the curtains? Not us! The entire Ikigai team is fully doxed. That’s right, no faceless avatars, no mysterious figures—just real humans with real names and way too much caffeine. We’re working around the clock (seriously, do crypto people even sleep?) to bring you the goods. So if you’ve ever wondered, “Is there a meme coin out there that isn’t just a dog in sunglasses?” Ikigai is the answer. Real team, real purpose, real passion… and probably real coffee addictions.

**Ikigai: The Meme Coin with a Purpose (Yes, You Read That Right)**

We get it. Most meme coins are like sugar rushes—fun for a minute, then crash, burn, and leave you wondering what just happened. But not Ikigai. We’re here to introduce the world to purpose. We’re bringing Ikigai—the Japanese philosophy of finding one’s reason for being—straight to the blockchain. So, when people ask, “Is it a meme coin or a self-help guide?” You can proudly say, “Both, baby!” We’re changing the game, one feature at a time, by proving you can have fun and meaning in one shiny crypto package. 🚀

🔥 **Upcoming Features: Because We’re Just Getting Started**

Staking? Check. Lottery? Check. That’s right, we’re rolling out staking and lottery options because let’s face it—who doesn’t like earning passive income while dreaming about winning big? It’s like putting your money to work, but with a side of adrenaline. Soon, you’ll have more reasons to cuddle—I mean, hodl—Ikigai than ever before!

And don’t even get me started on our upcoming SPL 404 NFTs! These bad boys are going to combine NFT fun with the deep meaning Ikigai stands for. It’s like art that looks cool and makes you feel like you’ve achieved enlightenment at the same time. Who knew you could be a crypto investor and an art connoisseur in one go?

**The Ikigai Community: Where Memes Meet Mission**

Here’s where things get really special. What sets Ikigai apart isn’t just our features—it’s you. That’s right, our community is like a superhero squad, but instead of capes, you’ve got memes, and instead of fighting crime, we’re fighting aimlessness. Every day we’re growing, laughing, and making this movement stronger. Plus, we’re dropping regular content on X (formerly Twitter, but you know the drill) that’ll keep you entertained, from hilarious videos to weekly comics that remind you that crypto can actually be fun.

**Get Involved: It’s Like Joining a Cult, but With More Purpose**

Whether you’re a crypto veteran or just stumbled in here because of the meme coin hype, Ikigai is the project for you. We’ve got transparency, a killer roadmap, and we’re constantly cooking up new features. Plus, you can actually say we’re a meme coin with a straight face because, you know… we have a purpose.

Check out the latest updates, laugh with us, cry when the market dips (but in a healthy, purposeful way), and join the movement that’s taking crypto from Lambo memes to life goals:

Peering down, he saw Frank open the door and step back slightly.

""Well. Dillon. Come on in.""

In strode Deputy Dillon Anton, all six-foot-two of her. She was not dressed for work, so Kai had to imagine this was a casual, friendly visit.

After all, even an inveterate lone wolf might want companionship now and then.

""Frank, how ya been? Heard tell you're all recovered.""

""Remission. Got a few years to go to see if I'm totally recovered. Come on, come on along to the kitchen. I'll make coffee.""

Deputy Anton trailed after Frank, nodding up at Kai as they passed the stairs. Kai nodded as well, then turned and started back into his room. Mikey had already disappeared back behind the door of the guest room, and only Shelly emerged from the room she and Tara shared, headed for the bathroom. She had a lot of upset stomach lately, which only added to the tension in the house.

Kai traded his robe for jeans and a t-shirt, then padded down to see what was shaking in the kitchen.

The percolator was going, and Frank had started in to make breakfast while Deputy Anton sat at the table and watched.

""Hey there, Kai,"" the deputy smiled.

She had mirrored sunglasses on, even here in the kitchen, and that seemed odd. Then Kai realized he had never seen her without those same shades.

""Hey,"" he breathed, and opened the fridge, feigning interest in the juice selection.

""So,"" Frank started, ""to what do we owe the pleasure of a Sunday morning visit?""

""Ah, I just wanted to check on y'all,"" Deputy Anton said.  
""We might not be blood, but in a way, we're kin.""

""So we are, in a manner of speaking. This just a little reconnecting visit then? Nothing serious?""

Kai finally pulled the orange juice from the fridge as he heard the creak of a chair. When he glanced toward Deputy Anton, he saw she had shifted into a more relaxed posture.

""Well, there were a couple of little things. Just some stuff I heard that I was wonderin' if y'all might know about.""

Frank was carefully placing strips of bacon in a pan.

""Oh yeah?""

""Yeah. See, few weeks back now, I had a talk with some fellas in town. Some of the Rod and Gun boys. They'd been out in the woods the night before, probably drunk out of their minds, and they saw somethin' that put a real jump into 'em.""

""Pink elephants?"" Frank chuckled.

The deputy laughed; it was a pleasant, mellifluous sound, Kai thought. He poured his juice, then turned to lean back against the counter as he drank.

He wanted an eye on their guest in case something went sideways.

""No, no. Those fellas are drinkers, but I don't know as any of 'em are that bad just yet. Nah. They did see an animal, though. Course, they're a mite divided on what it was. Some of 'em thought it was a big coyote. Some of 'em thought it was a wolf.""

Kai nearly choked on a second sip of his juice, but he managed to fight through. Frank, meanwhile, was cool as anything, focused entirely on cooking.

""Wolf, huh? You out and about that night, Dillon?""

Again, Deputy Anton laughed, but this time it was a colder sound.

""Now, Frank, you know me a bit. You know I keep myself cool so I don't change but at moons, and when I do, I keep in the house.""

""Well, was it a moon when the guys saw the animal.""

""Nope. 'Bout a week early.""

""Well. Those guys were probably drunk and saw some loose dog or something. You know the Rod and Gun guys.""

""Mm-hmm I do. Coulda been a dog. But speaking of dogs...""

Deputy Anton paused a while, glancing around the kitchen a moment.

""Speaking of dogs,"" she repeated, ""Hank Custin lost one of his herd dogs a little while ago. Got into a fight with somethin' or other one night and got all tore up. Whatever did it got two ducks, a ram, and a goat besides.""

""That's too bad.""

""Sure is.""

""What's the... What seems like to've happened?""

""Oh, we dunno yet. Sheriff called in some boys from Sioux Falls. Forensics guys. They're runnin' all sorts of tests. Just at a guess, it was some pretty tough animal that did it. Maybe a bear, **maybe**. Or a coyote.""

""Or a wolf?"" Frank offered.

Kai suppressed a nervous groan.

""Could be a wolf. Could be. Anyhow, I specially wanted to ask if you might know anything about that, seein' as Custin's place is right next to yours.""

Frank was carefully moving bacon from the pan to a plate, then slipping more strips into the pan.

""Well, now,"" he said, ""don't know as I'd know about anything like that.""

""It woulda happened the same day as that memorial for your parents. That night, I mean. Don't suppose you or anyone in the family...""

""We did have everyone over that night. Had a bonfire down by the pond and spent the evening reminiscing. Didn't see any odd animals.""

""Well,"" Deputy Anton sighed, and she shifted again in her chair, ""that's lucky for y'all, I guess.""

I'm really debating on what type of machine is better for me.

I need something that is quick, easy but at the same time I can grow into it. We only drink black coffee - espresso, ristretto, americano. We almost never have milk beverages. We probably do 2-3 total in the morning (espresso and americano) and then two more during the day for me (at different times). That's it. I would like to get something that gets me as close as possible to italian coffee you drink at a random bar in italy. I will not use different beans daily, I'll simply buy a 1kg bag and use those beans until I finish them. I need less complexity but at the same time I want to be able to grow and try out new things brewing espressos, but I don't want a machine that scares me away right off the bat. I would like something that heats up quickly,  low flushing needs so I'm not refilling water continuously, that's easy to clean (by me).

I can't decide if single/dual boiler or HX is the right machine for me. After doing some research I found the following:

Lelit Elizabeth v3 - $1800

Lelit Mara X - $1700

Racilio Silvia Pro X - $2000 but can get it from Italy at $1300 (the 110v)

Rocket Appartamento - Also from Italy for $1300 (110v)

Quick Mill Silvano - $1300

“You’re good to go!”

Lichess is one of two websites that comprise nearly 100% of the online chess market. Although it is less visible than the Chesscom behemoth, having a stained reputation on Lichess is a huge deal. In my experience playing over the board, not one person has given me their Lichess user name and when I gave out mine, it was scoured and at least two opponents looked at my games before we played.

More concerningly, it became known to me at the third over the board tournament that others can see my account is restricted. I’m not playing humans at all - I only get matched with cheaters or bots. “You never cheated?” A tournament director asked me after making it apparent that he had seen my account and made the logical conclusion that I had, in fact, cheated. It wasn’t just the tournament director who had come to that conclusion, because a heated conversation took place in which every single participant and their family member heard me defending myself against the completely off base and totally unfounded decision by Lichess. I have never cheated. I would never cheat. And to add insult to injury, Lichess has responded to my request that all restrictions be removed from my account: “Your account is not marked in ANY way,” they told me. “You’re good to go!”

It’s incredibly hard to say what’s more egregious, first I was marked as a cheater for - presumably - playing too well. Then they shamelessly tell me that my account has no restrictions. Any savvy user can easily find the proof that I’m not “good to go,” I have the same standing on Lichess that a serial cheater (perhaps a cheater who unfairly won money in a tournament, even) would have. And if you’re not someone who naturally navigates computers and code? No problem, the Lichess discord server is full of moderators and devs that are thrilled to help you pinpoint who has the mark of shame. The same Lichess staff can be found on discord 24 / 7 and they can help with just about anything - I would warn you against asking them about chess. It’s really not their game.

At the first tournament I played - the state blitz championship - I walked in 5 minutes after they had started. I didn’t have coffee. And my first opponent was rated about 1500 USCF. I believe he’s closer to 2000 now. I got crushed the first game. For the second game, I had the white pieces. I played D4 and hit the clock. D5. Knight F3. Knight F6. G3. I played a Catalan and easily cruised to victory, pushing two pawns on the flank to promote. Suddenly my opponent yelled “illegal move!” Confused and missing out on the exact rule, I trusted that my opponent was in the right and didn’t consult a tournament director. I had easily won on the board, but knew I’d win plenty of games. Playing against a 1350 USCF player two rounds later, I pinned my opponent’s F pawn and captured on G6 with my queen. Once again, I heard “illegal move!” At the time, I thought I must be getting adjusted to playing over the board, and had somehow believed the queen was on another diagonal.

Now I’m wondering if my opponents were regulars on the Lichess discord server. I finished the state blitz championship with 7.5, one game behind the unrated state champion.",1,1729694040.0,u_Mustachiola,0,1.0,False

I also have ADHD which means this kind of role is extra draining. The ""live support"" element is partly good for ADHD as it forces me to work, but executive function wise it can be draining always working on several small tasks rather than one big project where I can get a momentum/get away with peaks and troughs in energy.

\- The last few months my CFS has been getting worse. Lately I've been dreading every day at work, it's like wading through mud. I feel extremely unmotivated and initiating tasks is becoming increasingly difficult. I'm also getting more irritable and finding it difficult every time my manager asks me to do something or gives me feedback. 

\- Some days I can feel good and motivated between 10am - 12pm after a coffee when I've got a good caffeine buzz going...

\- I think I'm probably in burnout / extended PEM from trying to work through PEM and fighting ADHD constantly.

\- My company is UK based and I'm covered financially if I need to take long term sick leave. **But,** I feel really guilty as I've only been there a year. They've already accommodated me a lot (e.g. letting me go to part time 4 days a week recently, being ok with all the sick leave I've had to take  - random days off here and there). If it's relevant, I've had good feedback on my performance so far and been reassured by HR that they're not worried in that aspect. 

**Basically, I want to take a month off work to recover. I just feel bad because it puts more work on the rest of the team whilst I'm off, and awkward because I've not been there long. But I'm worried I'll get worse if I don't take the break. Can anyone reassure me / give me the final push to do this? Anyone been in a similar boat?**

I'd love to quit entirely but that's a bit too terrifying right now (plus money wise wouldn't be ideal). ",4,1729693985.0,CFSplusADHD,2,1.0,False

I have grown children who have mostly moved out (my son is moving out in the new year). I also have a dog and a cat. I have been asked out a few times and while I take the phone number, I find myself uninterested in pursuing the actual date. I love my little life - it’s easy. I wake up, enjoy my slow coffee, get dressed and take my pup for a walk - come home, make my lunch and get to work. When I’m finished work I head straight home, feed my pup, cook my own dinner and then we go for our evening walk, I pop into the shower after the walk, make a cup of tea, relax for a bit and then head to bed. I’m rather introverted - I can be extroverted, but it takes me days to recoup. When I live my life like this, I’m always recovered. I don’t know how to fit dating into my life when I love the comfort. I’m happy. It’s crazy, when I was younger there was so much fear of being alone - now I’m cherishing it. I received a phone number yesterday from a fella I’ve chatted to a few times - I did tell him I am happy single and it has been several years, but I also said I would go for coffee - I will go for coffee, but I’m already struggling with the idea of trying to make time. I’m truly a homebody. I’d like to get myself out there, but I also don’t want to disturb my peace. Does that make sense? (My 2 previous relationships were abusive) has anyone else gone through this? Did you find that after a period of time you decided that you’d like to date again? ",3,1729693981.0,HappySingleWomen,2,1.0,False

It's hard, but I can feel myself getting better at it every time I play. It's got secrets I want to learn. The risk/reward is well-balanced, and best of all - if I die I don't have to replay the same way-too-easy starting levels because it's different every time.

Last summer I built a coffee table out of construction materials and applied a layer of epoxy throughout the entire piece. Unfortunately, i left this table outside of my house, and some damage on the side has occurred and the epoxy has yellowed, and I’d like to replace it.

I understand epoxy is near impossible to remove off wood directly, but the centerpiece of my table was coated in Mod Podge PRIOR to laying on epoxy coats, and I am more concerned about removing the epoxy off of the centerpiece with NO damage, reapply the mod podge adhesive, rebuild the frame of the table, and re-epoxy with the centerpiece of the original table.

I can upload images of my table if I couldn’t describe my issue well enough.

1gabxt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1gabxt9/market_digest_1023_earnings_issues_and_the/,"Market Digest (10/23) - Earnings, Issues and the Risk-off trade","As I type this after 30 minutes, the markets are slipping about .5% across the board.

$MCD hitting the skids big time after an e. coli outbreak. Down 5.2% to $298 but that level is still well off the $243 52WL. It pays 2.25%, I don't own it and probably won't. It is moving the market however. $BA reported a huge loss and the stock isn't moving, signaling the bad news is in. At least the bad news that is known about. This issue can't get out of its own way and is toxic to investors. Stay away.

$SBUX earnings were bleak and it signaled it's not getting much better. I rolled out of this name when the $CMG CEO jumped ship to the coffee maker and shares raced higher. I was just looking for a reason to get out and that was it. Happy to be gone as this story is trending in the wrong direction ... at least until the new CEO can work his old $CMG magic.

Earnings are kicking off in a big way now so things should be getting very interesting with two weeks to go before the election. 

$KO earnings were okay'ish but they are taking their standard post number dive, down nearly 3%. I don't much care to be honest, up or down 3% is par for the course. I hold KO for income while surfing the consumer waves up and down.

$UBER caught a nice upgrade noting FCF (Free Cash Flow) trends and its attractive valuation given the placement with peers. Not helping today in the sea of red as markets come down. I own this name and may add to it if I can catch more of a dip.

$AMZN, one of my ""best idea"" overweight stocks was reiterated as a top pick while $AAPL was raised to outperform. Here we go into earnings and, right on schedule, the analysts are pumping names ahead of their numbers either to get flat with the trade, or place option strategies around the holding. Either selling covered call or protective collars. That said, I happen to believe AMZN is a great play here but I would not be rushing into the name.

Oh $MSFT was reiterated as a buy at Citi. Yada, yada, yada.  I do happen to like them and own them as well.

Remember when $CVNA was dead in the water, bankruptcy sharks were circling and the rats were fleeing the ship? Don't look at it now. It was below $30 a year ago.

You traders should keep an eye on $AMLX. They caught a sizable upgrade and $10 price objective, suggesting more than a 100% move. I know y'all are more interested in $LASE, $LUNR, etc., but AMLX has some drug fires burning that could have legs.

Looking at my quote list I see a continued risk off trend. Whether due to earnings fears, a tired bull or the upcoming election, the AI names are being sold off. Put me down in the camp expecting weakness into the election as Wall Street determines it can risk-off the the event and then roll back in after the all-clear signal is given. $NVDA's earnings are also AFTER the election which bodes well.

Looking at my list here, the selling is intensifying.

Green is found in our AI Energy names and safety names, but gains are meager at best. MSFT having a good day off the upgrade but I think I think it's a bit of a catch-up move.

The big decliners on my list are $REGN, $ASML, $PANW, $ARM, $NOW, $NFLX, $CRWD, $LULU, $HUBS and our favorite $NVDA. All in that order. 

If you recall my note from a day or two ago regarding the strength in PANW and CRWD. That is unwinding a bit today.

In economic news, despite better housing inventories, lower rates, etc., existing home sales fell to a 14-year low. Garbage. 

Overall, there's no teeth to the selling today in my estimation, unless you believe the election is a catalyst for even more red. I have one foot in that camp, so maybe it's not toothless. What I'm saying is that I'm not seeing conviction in the selling yet. It could spread, or it may not. The AI names will remain the AI names and momentum is likely lost only for a couple of days. If you missed out, this could be your opportunity in the next two weeks.

I just don't see enough catalysts to the upside right now to aggressively add any names and the path of least resistance is lower in my book. I'm still feeling ""trimmy"" and may be doing so to end the week, maybe even starting today. We'll see.

Have a great Wednesday.

Any advice or suggestions that have worked for you?,"Basically as the title says. Every night I spend 2-5 hours just trying to sleep. I don’t sleep in so regardless of what time I actually fall asleep I still get up at 7am. It is absolutely draining. 

I don’t nap, I don’t drink coffee after 11am, and I try all these “help” things I find that are supposed to help you sleep but my brain will not stop. This isn’t new for me. I’ve been like this my whole life, but as I’m getting older, it is getting absolutely draining and because I’m so tired. I’m just angry. 

I’ve tried, sleepy tea, melatonin, magnesium, different types of sounds, sleep music, reading, total darkness and no sounds (which is the worst as my brain then gets really loud), different pillows, different sheets, having a bath, having a bath with lavender, warm drinks, different types of calming lights, meditation., breathing techniques and even sleeping pills. I’m at a total loss. And today I am so tired. I need to function at work in 2 hours of sleep and then do it all again. 

I don’t have a ton of stresses in my life other than sleep. Of course we all have some stress, but I don’t have a crazy amount or anything that would cause this.  I’ve been a horrible sleeper literally since birth. 

Any suggestions I am willing to try. I’m at a point where I get anxiety just thinking about going to bed.  I’ve talked to the doctor who just said, layoff caffeine and try breathing exercises.

While I would likely be enjoying a lungo every morning before work, I’d still enjoy a larger cup I could sip on the weekends. 

My question to everyone is, how does the americano and americano xl taste? From my understanding, you still use a lungo pod and it just adds an additional shot or two depending on which size you select. Are they watered down or do they still have a reasonably bold and rich taste?

Did I overreact?,"Alright so.. yesterday i had a difficult day. I applied for a job that i couldnt get because i failed a test that required 50 points to get the job.. i only got 45. It was a 5 point difference. Anyway. I was with 5 hours of sleep, i woke up, got to the test, when i left family called that my grandpa is sick and he s in the hospital receiving oxygen and treatment and everything and that he's close to dying, i drove 2 hours to get there , on the way there the test result came and i found out that i failed, i saw my grandpa in a difficult situation with my whole family gathered, i got back again 2 hours of driving and i planned on going for a coffee with my girlfriend. 

I wrote to her that im coming close to her appartment. She told me she left the home and she s on her way. When i got there, i called her and she said she s on the way (mentioning a specific place) but then when i asked her where she was because i wanted to clarify the meeting point, she hung up on me. I called her immediately again, and she didnt answer. A minute later she comes out of her appartment,because i did drive by her door, and when i called i was just afraid we re gonna get confused about us meeting and wanted to let her know im close, anyway, she started apologizing for her not being honest because she was late and ok this was fine i swear i didnt mind but then i just asked her why didnt u pick up and she looked me in the eyes and said: i didnt hear iit, the phone hung up itseelf etcetc. Which pissed me off a little because i just dont like being lied to. Being lied is what i perceive as being considered vulnerable and stupid. Anyway we went to a coffee and clearly i was mad and wasnt talking to her for like 10 minutes, i was watching a game, expecting her to just realise she was wrong and apologise. Then she says after 10 mins are we talking now or do u prefer watching the game. I looked at her and said: i wanna watch the game. She then ditched me in the coffee bar. 5 mins later i got up and got home. We haven't talked since. What do you think?",1,1729692888.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

1gabl59,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1gabl59/is_cheating_like_hitting_the_reset_button_or_just/,Is cheating like hitting the reset button or just losing some progress?,"Hi all - Until this weekend, I had been almost exclusively carnivore for a month with the exception of a daily black coffee, which I'm working to phase out, and a few zero/low carb drinks every now and then. I had a wedding over the weekend in a completely different country and traveling through the airports was particularly challenging (had to settle for a hot dog without bread in Panama). 

Due to a limited number of options, I ultimately caved on the last day and had a piece of bread which was my doctor's number 1 no no :\\ Between that, the drinks and a couple of bouts with veggies, I'm feeling guilty. Can anyone share more information regarding how the body reacts after a couple of days of small to moderate cheats? Did I just lose any progress I made over the last month?

I'm supposed to be on this diet for at least 3 months because of GI, brain fog, and fatigue issues although I didn't experience any major changes in symptoms over the weekend. ",0,1729692859.0,carnivorediet,8,0.5,False
