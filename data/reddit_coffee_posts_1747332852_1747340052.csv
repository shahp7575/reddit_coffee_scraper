Is there something I'm missing?","We recently got the Aiden and love the quality of coffee it brews, but the amount of coffee it consumes seems extremely high. Both my girlfriend and I drink about two cups of coffee a day (between 16-20oz). Now, according to the Aiden, a cup is just over 5 ounces, and making four cups of coffee would produce about 20 ounces in the Aiden, which is 7.5 tablespoons of coffee. 

If my girlfriend and I consume that much coffee a day (let's say 14 tablespoons total), that would mean we go through a 1lb bag of coffee every 4.5 days. 

Is this right? 

Is there something I am missing here? 

This seems like an extreme amount of coffee for what we are actually getting out of this coffee maker. 

At this point, getting coffee at the coffee shop would be the same price. Is there a way to still get a great cup of coffee while conserving the amount of coffee per brew? ",1,1747339917.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

I connected with this cute middle-aged woman (47). It was an organic real-world meet cute (not online dating). Well technically I'm her client. 

We hit it off. She made me feel safe and seen and heard - thus I can be myself when with her and my self-esteem is very much stable with her. I never felt ""too much"" nor ""nit enough"" for her. We can talk about common interests for hours. We have the same humor (dry, dead-pan, sarcastic sometimes). Same wave length. We came from the same university. We can both be vulnerable with each other. She gets me, and I get her even without words.

I really really like her and I really care for her. And I just want to be with her all the time.

I'm sure she isn't married. I'm not 100% sure yet na wala sya jowa. And I have no idea if sapphic sya.

I send her coffees from time to time to her workplace. Sometimes snacks. And gifts on special occassions.

I know I have to ask her soon if she has a jowa.. and maybe later if she is sapphic too or open to it.

I'm taking it slow because it's too tender, special and fragile for me. This is the first time I felt this way with another person. So I'm afraid to rush it.

How do kids these day courts? Is courting still a thing? What else should I do? Any advise, suggestions or thoughts will be greatly appreciated. Please guide this old baby gay here. TIA.",1,1747339837.0,WLW_PH,1,1.0,False
1kni1e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Effexor/comments/1kni1e1/effexor_hyper_clear_headed/,Effexor Hyper Clear Headed,"Been on Effexor for over a year now for anxiety, and overall it's been extremely positive. It has improved so many different aspects of my life. 

With that said, I had a few interesting experiences, and I'm wondering if anyone else has had the same.


1) Extremely clear-headed. The only way I can really explain this is that it's the farthest thing from brain fog. It's rare, but it has happened a few times when I've felt extremely focused and clear-headed, way past anything I would deem sober. 

Note this was mostly physical. My mental headspace was more or less the same. It amplified my current emotions if anything at all. 


2) Very positive synergy and increased tolerance to caffeine. I've been one to drink a lot of coffee my whole life, but I became very sensitive to caffeine as my anxiety got worse. To the point where I could only have one cup of coffee before noon; otherwise, I would struggle sleeping. Now, it's better than ever. I can drink coffee until 8 p.m. with little to no impact on my sleep cycle.

The effects of caffeine are not quite the same. Sometimes it helps reduce anxiety, though that comes back with a rebound once the coffee wears off. Coffee occasionally makes me tired/sleepy too.

Coffee has also caused scenario 1 to occur a few times.

I'm a 17M currently living with a lifestyle carried by my mom (she's widowed for almost 5 years now) and that I can confidently say I'm quite getting the hang of it. I live in southern Italy, a very rowdy place indeed for those who want to know.

However, all I've been doing for the past 4 years is sulk and dissociate myself from the absurd brashness of society through Reddit and other things. I'm very sensitive, probably by autistic levels (i dunno just take it with a grain of salt).

Loud noises, specifically how loudmouthed the people around me are drive me insane to the point of violence. In fact, I risked suspension twice at my highschool because:  
‚Ä¢ I threw my journal near one of my teachers during a heated discussion;  
‚Ä¢ I almost injured one of my classmates by slamming the door open.

Sometimes it went too far out of the line, however said thoughts were nothing but intrusions in my mind. Said thoughts were mostly about murder, since I believed it was the best way to calm myself down.

So you have imagined by now that my highschool is the prime example of a place that drives me insane: some act like assholes, others have god complexes and a few suffer the same issues that I have.

And unfortunately these are the only people I must socialise with. I¬†***DESPISE***¬†this kind of folk, they remind me of my dad (he was often chill, but other times he acted a prick). This gradual mental decline has mostly sheltered me to stay alone. A ""take walks alone, or go drink a cup of coffee alone"" type situation.

Unfortunately this also demotivated me to see the few friends I actually cared about, including my crush who I believed I had a chance with since we share similar ideals and passions. My laziness unfortunately wasted said chance but also made me stray away from my peers.

Already having doubts posting this because I don't know if I sound corny or edgy, but I'm tired of venting and just want to improve, to camouflage myself among hundreds of miserable folk, while remaining somewhat happy.",1,1747339704.0,IWantToLearn,1,1.0,False

My only criteria is the below:

- I would like to take only trains, buses or ferries. 
- I‚Äôd like to swim a lot.
- I like to eat some great food, drink nice coffee, beer and wine.
- I‚Äôd like to see places I might not have heard of before
- I‚Äôd like to see a range of different landscapes, maybe mountains, coastal, lakes etc.
- I‚Äôll split my time between camping, hostels and maybe the occasional (but rare) hotel.

1knhxfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/1knhxfp/trying_to_find_probability_of_obtaining_an_item/,Trying to find probability of obtaining an item in a mobile merge game,"This probably falls under calculus, statistics or probability, all of which I have almost close to zero retained knowledge about (I took both calculus & statistics in college, don‚Äôt remember much and hated them so much I switched majors even tho I did pass the classes lol) 

This sounds really dumb but I‚Äôm just majorly curious and I love merge games and do like learning about certain theorems and statistical improbabilities and things like that sometimes so yeah lol. 

But I‚Äôm trying to find how I could find the probability of getting the specific item I need to merge into a higher level item and want the probability or equation for that. I‚Äôll try explaining better. So here it goes -

Let‚Äôs say this generator pops out 7 items. Most of the time, there will be 5 of item A, and only 2 of item B (the one I need to merge). However, since sometimes I only get 1 of B per 7 items, and even rarer sometimes I get 3 of item B out of 7. This makes it less constant and predictable, but for the sake of simplicity let‚Äôs say that out of every 20 tries, again with 7 items popping out each time, that‚Äôs a total of 140 items. 

So let‚Äôs say 70% of every 20 tries, it pops out 2 out of 7, 25% of every 20 tries it pops out 1, and 5% of the time it pops out 3. 


Now combine this with the merging aspect. It deals with exponents of 2 (combining two of the same object) so obvs something like 2^5 (for 5th level item) or 2^8 (for 8th level item). For this case let‚Äôs say I need that 5th level item, so 2^5 (which I know is 32). 

So what is the equation to even find out what the probability of getting to that 5th item is? And in absolute more specific terms (for the circumstances given) what would the answer even be? 

I‚Äôm trying to calculate how long it would take me to even get the item since the generators refresh every 30 mins to 2 hours and dispense anywhere from 7 to 30 items each (depends on the generator, like for instance a coffee maker will dispense 40 items and fully refreshes every hour and a half). The generator I‚Äôm talking about refreshes fully every 30 mins and dispenses 7 items like I said, so if anyone wants to calculate that into the equation as well that‚Äôd be awesome but I‚Äôm just trying to find out the probability first. 

Any help is appreciated ü•∞

1knhxd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1knhxd4/never_gamed_before_start_me_off_on_pc/,Never gamed before - start me off on PC!,"(Disclaimer: I've used the search function and saved quite a few threads to dig into more deeply. But I also wanted suggestions that might be a bit more personalised to me/my situation! Tl;dr: totally new PC gamer, recommend to me please!)

Background: boyfriend is a seasoned PC gamer, recently upgraded his machine and gave me his old one; I don't have the specs in my head but he says it should be good enough for most games of the kind I'd be wanting to play, but not the latest Cities: Skylines, which was one major reason why he upgraded.

Me: 45F. I have NEVER gamed before. Well, if you don't count Space Invaders and Pacman in the 80s! I occasionally play a few little games on my phone, but I don't count those lol.

Lifestyle: Self-employed single 50/50 parent of a young child; I have too many hobbies already lol. With that in mind, I **can't** play: (a) anything co-op where I have to be good to go for specific timeslots; (b) anything that can't tolerate being quickly paused and interrupted to deal with nightmares, vomit, unexpected spiders, and other such incidents; or (c) anything where I have to be stuck to the PC for hours on end. On 'child weeks' I can't usually carve out more than half an hour max on weekdays to play, and even on childfree weeks it can be a struggle depending on my workload, but I might be able to get more time in.

More about me: I'm literally totally unfamiliar with gaming and its various mechanics, tropes, etc. For instance, I've heard Portal recommended a lot, but I've also seen people say coordinating the controls can be hard for n00bs and the motion can be disorienting and it can be physically tricky to get through the chambers for that reason. I'm vaguely aware of the principles of investigating objects to see if they do stuff, following paths/side quests etc., letting yourself be guided by the design of the game, e.g. being led to key spots, picking up on things that 'look different' that might unlock stuff, etc., but in actual practice I have zero experience of that stuff and fully expect to be crap at it at first.

I play piano and guitar and am almost ambidextrous - can use either hand equally comfortably for mouse, for instance, and being British drive stick daily lol so am used to 'one hand/side of the body does one thing while the other does another', but again, totally unfamilar with PC game controls. Having said that, I don't *think* I need to be babied *too* much; I mean, I've lived this long, I think I can get to grips with making my fingers do stuff.

What I like: tbh I can see the appeal of pretty much any style of game! I like the idea of FPS but as mentioned can't really dig in to play anything unpausable due to the childbeast. I also like the idea of strategy games, worldbuilding games, fantasy games, ones with quick bursts of action and also ones that are chill and relaxing. I enjoy puzzles too but am better at some kinds than others. I'm not fussed about whether I seem 'childish' or not lol.

How my mind works: I'm usually good with words but not so much with challenging maths. In the analogue world I'm good at: cryptic crosswords, logic puzzles (those ones like 'Bob is 5 years older than Nerissa; the person with a black coffee is 35; Justin is 22 and drinks tea' type thing), anagrams, sudoku, puzzles where you have to find patterns in things or sequences. I can do 3x3 and 5x5 Rubik's cubes. I'm bad at: division, algebra (more than basic), have only tried an escape room once but we didn't succeed in it (although tbf my gamer bf was in our party and didn't have any more luck than me!). I enjoy playing chess but I'm not very good!

I'm aware my reaction times won't be what they were when I was 18, but I think they're pretty good in general. Art is my strong point, so I like nice visuals, but my screen is only small, so anything too grandiose is probably wasted on me lol. Apart from being a glasses/contacts wearer I'm in good health, so nothing physical to take into consideration, but my desk and resulting mouse area is very small, so anything that requires big mouse range is probably out.

I like all sorts, from cute cartoons to dark body horror type stuff. I have no triggers or phobias. Phone games I've enjoyed in the past are Mario Run (I had to watch walkthroughs to figure out where to pick up some of the stars, but I enjoyed getting them after), Tetris, Block Blast, Word Trip, Candy Crush (that one less than the others tbh but I still dabble). My real-life hobbies are geocaching, knitting, crochet, spinning, drawing/painting, reading (literally any/all genres and topics!).

I wouldn't say I'm slow on the uptake, but I also wouldn't say I'm super fast either (I'm pretty switched on but my brain has just started feeling its age a bit). I don't want a game that's going to be so difficult to learn that it'll put me off completely. But I'm also not averse to focusing and putting a bit of effort into learning it, either!

Something many people don't know is that all accountants are banished from both heaven and hell. Instead, accounants all go to the big office in the sky where they journalize all the deeds of people on earth. The accountants all get free coffee and endless donuts and bagels, as well as a weekly pizza party, in exchange for eternal toil, so they're mostly happy with the deal. 

So the freshly dead accountant arrives at the office and is immediately shown the ropes. Accounting in the afterlife is very similar to the regular work, it's just the accounts that are different. For example, if you help an old lady cross the street, that's a debit to good deeds and credit to time and energy. If you give to charity that's a debit to good deeds and credit to cash. 

So the new accountant quickly gets into a routine and starts doing some good work. One day however, as he is finishing off the journal entries for a person who has just died he sees that the accounts don't balance. He can't figure out where the mistake is so he takes the issue to his floor manager, St. Peter. 

St. Peter looks at the problem and says, ""Oh, don't worry about this, it's just a system error, I can fix it. I've been begging management to upgrade our software for millennia but they never listen. The guy in charge is a complete nepo hire, he doesn't understand any of what we do.

What would you do?","I (30 F) have an ex best friend (J) that I have known since I was born. Our moms used to be besties and would always tell us about how they would get stuck in the local coffee shop door way together when they were pregnant with us. Practically lived at each others houses, spent so much time together. 

I started dating my husband in HS and she started seeing my cousin some months later. We were super excited at the prospect of her being an official part of my family legally some day. Senior year of HS they get pregnant, and we were super excited. They got kicked out of his mom‚Äôs place and my husband‚Äôs family let them crash with them for a while, which is where tensions started rising. They were lazy and made messes without cleaning them up, relied on my MiL for free child care, and my cousin would park his laptop at the dining table playing video games. It caused a lot of issues with hubby‚Äôs parents. Then they started to throw insults at my hubby and I disguised as insults. Things about how we weren‚Äôt on the same stage of life as them or were not achieving anything. Everything came to a head and we had a falling out. They left, it was ugly, didn‚Äôt talk for years. 

My dad died suddenly, and it was the most traumatic thing I‚Äôve ever experienced (hubby and I found him). We got home from the hospital and slept, and I woke up to a knock on my bedroom door (living with my mother). She gave condolences and wanted to be friends again and support me. I gave her another chance. I low key missed her. Some time later she moved in with mom and I with her man and kid. It was Covid time, they had no where else to go and we all thought it would be nice to have a family unit during the pandemic. It was great for a while. We had a good time, had family game nights and dinners. Unfortunately the messy behaviors started happening again, same with the insults. I overlooked it. They found a place, we helped them move, great. They wanted to hang out a lot still, but wanted us to always come to them and drop everything else. Slowly my hubby and I stopped showing up as often, due to the getting fed up with the insults. I messaged them asking if they could stop doing that and how it made us feel. That we love them, but we also aren‚Äôt okay with essentially being emotional punching bags. They get defensive and say ‚ÄúWelL if You GuyS woUld Do sOmeThiNg wIth YouR LivEs‚Äù (we were just not what they agreed with). Que another nasty fall out. 

5 years later mom gets diagnosed with cancer. She tried to fight, but within a month she was in hospice. J and her husband were FaceTiming with mom while she was in the hospital calling her mom and telling her how much she loves her and all that. Mom passed next day. I was devastated. I helped with funeral planning since I was labeled the trustee. When things were solidified, I let J know when and where the services were going to be held. Funeral comes and J nor my cousin were there, even after playing a daughter right before she died. Honestly, I‚Äôm *still* upset about it. We haven‚Äôt talked since. 

Almost two years later, my husband and I are in a really good place. I‚Äôm 23 weeks pregnant with twins, and life is just bliss. I have kept it on the DL for the most part, only telling family and close friends. Well J caught wind of my pregnancy and DMed me congratulating me on finally becoming a mother and asked me for a mailing address since she would like to send a gift for the babies. If I‚Äôm honest I have so many feelings. Angry, because why now? What is your motive? You didn‚Äôt show up to mom‚Äôs funeral and now that I‚Äôm pregnant you pop up again? A part of me misses the good parts of the friendship we had, but I also cannot ignore the repeated bad behavior. I don‚Äôt want to be anyone‚Äôs punching bag, either because I‚Äôm not living how they want me to or I/we get to do something she/they don‚Äôt get to. On the other hand I know people have the capacity to change.

Got a cup for 4 euros and they let you choose 3 flavors. I got mango, coffee and banana. That first bite was amazing. It was smooth, creamy, not too sweet and captured each flavor well. They have tons of flavors to choose from. 10k reviews in google maps! Can‚Äôt wait to go back tomorrow 

One of the tour guides I went with was right. Look for a gelato place where you can‚Äôt see the gelato, because they‚Äôre kept in a metal tube container with lids on to keep them fresh. 

Second place goes to Come il Latte, they have the same set up as La Romana in terms of their gelato and they‚Äôre only about 5 mins from each other so you can compare both ",2,1747339109.0,rome,1,0.75,False

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you‚Äôre serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you‚Äôre serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time ‚Äî think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

Read this detailed review!,"The **Oster TSSTTRJBG1 2-Slice Toaster, Grey** caught my attention due to its sleek metallic grey design and its assortment of practical features. Known for consistent toasting results, this kitchen gadget seemed perfect for someone like me who spends more time in the mornings juggling coffee cups and breakfast plates than critically examining toast textures. I‚Äôve been putting this toaster through its paces every morning, testing everything from bagels to artisanal breads, and it‚Äôs fair to say I have some thoughts to share.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the metallic grey finish really stood out. This toaster feels sturdy, thanks to its stainless steel construction, and looks polished enough to fit seamlessly into most modern kitchens. Its compact dimensions (6.9""D x 11.7""W x 7.3""H) mean it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which was a huge plus in my already crowded little kitchen. The high-rise lever is another detail I appreciated‚Äîno more scraping fingers on the toaster slots to retrieve half-popped toast. My only gripe is that the polished surface tends to show fingerprints easily, so it‚Äôs something to consider if you‚Äôre a neat freak like me.

**Performance with Different Bread Types**  
This toaster promises even toasting, and more often than not, it delivers. The auto-adjusting bread guides in the wide slots accommodate everything from bagels to thicker artisanal loaves, which I tested extensively. Bagels toasted on the ""bagel"" mode came out just right‚Äîcrisp on the cut side, yet soft on the outer edge. My rye bread experiment turned out great as well. However, thinner slices of bread, such as sandwich slices, browned slightly unevenly at times, particularly when on the lighter shade settings. While it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker for me, it might matter if you demand perfection in your toast.

**Ease of Use Features**  
Navigating through the seven shade settings was surprisingly simple. Whether I was aiming for barely toasted or dark and crispy, the dial was intuitive to use. I tested all four of its programs‚ÄîBagel, Frozen, Pastry, and Regular Toast‚Äîand the precision of the timings was on point. Using the frozen mode for waffles saved me a ton of time on hectic mornings, achieving the perfect golden-brown without soggy middles. However, adjusting toasting times for non-standard items felt a little trial-and-error, so be prepared for occasional second runs if you're a customization fan.

**[Check Oster TSSTTRJBG1 price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b00f5nuoh6/)**

**Highlights**  
- Its **7 toast shade settings** provide plenty of room to customize your mornings.  
- The **extra-wide slots** accommodate even thick bagels and artisanal bread effortlessly.  
- High-rise lever makes retrieving smaller items of toast super convenient.  

**Nonetheless, there are a couple of areas for improvement too.**  

**Shortcomings**  
- Some toast shade settings resulted in uneven browning, especially on thin slices.  
- The polished surface, though elegant, is prone to smudges and fingerprints.  

**Other Options to Consider**  
After testing out the Oster toaster, I couldn‚Äôt resist comparing it to a few alternatives like the Cuisinart CPT-122 2-Slice Compact Plastic Toaster and the Breville Die-Cast 2-Slice Toaster. While Cuisinart offers a budget-friendly compact size, the build quality felt relatively lightweight, and even toasting wasn‚Äôt consistent on bagels. Breville‚Äôs toaster, on the other hand, excels in premium features like a progress indicator and superior browning control but comes at almost double the price. In this case, the Oster toaster seems like a fantastic middle-ground option: affordable, stylish, and packed with features you‚Äôd expect from pricier models.

**Smart Spending**  
While the price tag can fluctuate slightly depending on where you shop, the Oster TSSTTRJBG1 is undoubtedly a cost-effective option for its feature set. Its versatility with different bread types, durable stainless steel design, and solid toasting performance offer excellent value in its category. Sure, you might occasionally deal with uneven browning or wipe a few smudges off the surface, but if you aren‚Äôt after showroom-level aesthetics, this toaster ticks the boxes for efficiency and affordability.

Hey MaximizeMe community,

Let's face it, finding a good deal is as satisfying as that first sip of coffee in the morning. Whether you're a die-hard bargain hunter or new to the game, this post is for you. Today, we‚Äôll dive into the magical world of hidden clearance deals and how they can revolutionize your shopping habits. And guess what? You don‚Äôt need to pay a cent to unlock this knowledge‚Äîjust check out the *free* resources available at [this link](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals).

#### What is Hidden Clearance?

For those new to the concept, hidden clearance refers to discounts and markdowns not prominently advertised in stores or online. Retailers often need to make room for new inventory, and rather than shouting these deals from the rooftops, they quietly mark down prices in their inventory systems. The key is knowing how to uncover these concealed gems.

#### Why is Hidden Clearance a Game Changer?

1. **Save Money**: The obvious perk. Who doesn't love saving money?
   
2. **Access Unique Finds**: Hidden clearance can lead to discovering unique items you missed when they were at full price.

3. **Elevate Your Shopping Game**: Once you master this, you'll likely never pay full price again for many items.

#### How to Discover These Deals

Here are some tried-and-true methods to uncover hidden clearance in your favorite retail haunts:

1. **Scan, Scan, Scan**: Many stores have scanning apps. Always scan items you suspect might be cheaper than marked. You'd be surprised by what you find.

2. **Stay Informed**: Join store loyalty programs for insider deals and markdown notifications.

3. **Utilize Online Resources**: Platforms and communities like [our secret resource](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals) offer valuable insights into current deals and markdown trends.

4. **Look for Obscure Shelves**: Often, clearance items are tucked away in less frequented areas of the store.

5. **Follow the Sales Cycles**: Pay attention to when seasonal goods typically go on sale.

#### The Community Advantage

One of the greatest benefits of being part of a savvy community like MaximizeMe is the collective wisdom we can all share. Have a tip of your own? Drop it in the comments and let's grow our clearance-hunting arsenal together.

#### Final Thoughts

By embracing the power of hidden clearance, you can keep more cash in your pocket while still indulging in your favorite shopping excursions. Want to dig even deeper into these savings strategies?

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/1aUvqSe)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you‚Äôve watched recently?

We don‚Äôt have a ton of money, but we‚Äôre not broke (we can still some beach trips, nice dinners, going out, etc). She gets money from her parents and by selling (honestly delicious) cinnamon rolls on Instagram. I freelance from home and just landed a decent paid job.

When I got the new job, I told her I could refer her since she meets all the qualifications (we studied the same). Every time I mentioned it she‚Äôd reply dismissively with ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôd be cool‚Äù (which in our native language is basically a shrug to shut the topic down) so I eventually dropped it.

A few weeks ago she stayed over and I hooked my laptop up to the TV to watch Netflix, but I didn‚Äôt realize i had my ‚Äúpayments‚Äù page open so that‚Äôs what the screen showed first, I quickly switched to Netflix and didn‚Äôt think much of it. Since then, though, she‚Äôs complained that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even make 1/5 of what you make,‚Äù and she‚Äôs increasingly refusing to pay for anything.

Since we started dating, we‚Äôve kind of had an unspoken arrangement of taking turns while paying (she covers the morning coffee, I cover dinner, or she buys movie tickets and I buy snacks) and I‚Äôve always tried to cover the pricier stuff because I know I make more. Now every time it‚Äôs her ‚Äúturn,‚Äù she just stares at me like she just expects me to pay (which I do). Once she even asked ‚ÄúDo you want money?‚Äù when I was already grabbing the bill. (Which I honestly felt kind of disrespectful)

I don‚Äôt want to force her into a job she might hate or quit in a few weeks, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to make her feel bad. I support her business and I‚Äôve even offered to cover the price of paid ads or whatever can help her business grow because I actually believe she has a ton of talent, but again, every time I‚Äôve brought this up she answers ‚Äúit‚Äôd be cool‚Äù and never follows up. But I also don‚Äôt want to feel exploited or like I‚Äôm single handedly supporting our outings, which is honestly not about the money but about the symbolic nature of it. How do I bring this up without making her defensive, and how can we find a fair way to handle our finances again? Any advice is appreciated.

Ishac | Syriac in Central and East Asia by Fred Aprim | Assyrian monks/ Assyrian merchants on Silk Road,"Beyond Artificial Intelligence: Human Recognition of a Syriac Fragment in Turfan by Ephrem A. Ishac

May 13, 2025

Last October 2024, I had the great privilege to be invited to give a paper at ‚ÄúThe International Conference on Turfan Study: New Developments on the Research of Jingjiao‚Äù in the city of Turpan (Central Asia ‚Äì West China), where I was honored to present alongside leading scholars working in the field of Turfan Studies from around the world. The conference was held within the Turpan Museum. During a coffee break, a kind Chinese student took me to see newly discovered materials in the museum, where my attention was drawn to a unique Syriac fragment attached to other fragments with Chinese script.

Figure 1: Welcoming note for Turfan Conference (18‚Äì22 October 2024) at Turpan Museum


The lighting was dim, the script faded, and distance prevented close inspection. After reading the visible Syriac words a couple of times, the familiar phrases resonated within me. In that moment, relying on nothing but my memory of Syriac prayers, a skill no algorithm can yet replicate, I recognized the familiar cadence of Psalm 91, and I started to recite the Psalm in the museum: Yes, it was from the Sutoro compline prayer ‚Äú‹ù‹¨‹í ‹í‹£‹¨‹™‹ó ‹ï‹°‹™‹ù‹°‹ê‚Äù!

Photo 2: The newly discovered fragment of Turfan exhibited in Turpan Museum 


This experience, far removed from the digital datasets that fuel Artificial Intelligence (AI), underscores a crucial point: while AI tools like Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) have made remarkable steps in automating transcription (as discussed in my previous post on Syriac HTR on Transkribus, here), they still face significant hurdles. 

AI algorithms struggle with the realities of manuscript research: faded ink, torn fragments, inconsistent scripts, and the slight signs that reveal liturgical function. In such cases, human expertise‚Äîthe ability to connect textual fragments with a broader historical and liturgical context becomes indispensable.


My fascinating experience of identifying the fragment at Turpan museum also resonates with an¬†earlier experience I had of unexpectedly finding¬† significant Syriac fragments housed at¬† the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale University (collection: Hartford Theological Seminary), where, as it often happens, many valuable texts ‚Äúflew under the digital and non-digital scholarly radars‚Äù (see part 1 and part 2). 

My extraordinary finding at Yale was an important lesson, to realize that not everything can be found in the digital or digitized catalogues, but in many cases, it is the human zeal and knowledge that can lead to incredible findings in the world of manuscripts.


#The Syriac-Chinese Turfan Fragment: A Glimpse of Psalm 91

The above-mentioned fragment in the Turpan Museum (as far as I could observe from behind its glass case) is made of paper inscribed with Syriac text. It appears to be a remnant of a small manuscript that was bound together with recycled fragments, including one bearing Chinese script. The visible Syriac words confirmed it as a portion of Psalm 91: 7c‚Äì13, according to the Syriac Peshitta.

Here is the complete Syriac text of the fragment that I have constructed from what I could see (the black color refers to what could be read, and the red color represents the missing text in the fragment):

Figure 3: Image of the constructed Syriac text (Psalm 91: 7c‚Äì13) of the Turfan fragment exhibited at Turpan Museum

The fragment‚Äôs liturgical context is significant: it aligns with the East Syriac morning prayer for Sundays and feasts (in Qdam W-Bathar), and the West Syriac compline prayer (Sutoro) traditions.


#Syriac Liturgical Presence Along the Silk Road

The presence of Syriac liturgical texts in Turfan is not an isolated occurrence. From around the 8th century onwards, Syriac Christian merchants and monks traveled from Mesopotamia along the Silk Road to central Asia and Chinaüá®üá≥establishing monasteries in places like Turfan. 

Those monks carried their liturgical traditions, including a rich collection of Syriac texts. Thanks to the remarkably dry weather of Turfan, the fragments were preserved in the sand for many centuries. The Syriac fragments found in the region contain prayers shared by both East and West Syriac traditions, highlighting Turfan‚Äôs role as a meeting point of diverse liturgical practices.


Figure 4: Xipang Jingjiao ‚Äì Turfan Monastery Site


#The Role of Human Intelligence

The human ability highlighted in the above story relied on more than just recognizing individual letters. If I think about it now, my capability to reach such a result required:

#Linguistic knowledge: -A proper understanding of Syriac script variations, allowing me to decipher faded and incomplete words (so of course, you need first to learn Syriac!)

#Liturgical memory: 

-The ability to recall Syriac prayers and liturgical formulas, providing a context for interpreting the fragment‚Äôs content (try to attend Syriac prayers?)

#Contextual understanding: -Familiarity with the historical development of Syriac liturgy, enabling me to place the fragment within a broader tradition.

Current AI tools for Syriac and likely for other languages as well are powerful, but they often struggle with fragmentary, damaged, or contextually ambiguous manuscripts. Human scholars bring a nuanced understanding that remains essential for accurate interpretation. Today, we often encounter overly optimistic projections about how AI might function in the real world echoing the early days of the computing revolution, when imagination sometimes outpaced reality. 

From my experience working extensively with both manuscripts and digital technology, I have found that human insight, informed by knowledge and experience, remains crucial for advancing the field of manuscript studies. It is this understanding that guides my current project at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

-The ‚ÄúIdentifying Scattered Puzzles of Syriac Liturgy‚Äù (ISP) Project and Turfan Fragments
My encounter with the Turfan fragment aligns directly with the objectives of the ongoing FWF project: ‚ÄúIdentifying Scattered Puzzles of Syriac Liturgy‚Äù https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/imafo/research/byzantine-research/byzantium-and-beyond/mobility-and-intercultural-contacts/identifying-scattered-puzzles-of-syriac-liturgy

(ISP), based at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. As discussed in my earlier post, ISP seeks to build a Syriac Liturgical Corpus by analyzing scattered fragments and tracing the historical diffusion of liturgical texts. The project‚Äôs aims include identifying textual matches, reconstructing missing portions, and providing liturgical and historical context for these fragments. Its progress is publicly accessible through the project‚Äôs website: https://syriac-liturgy.org.


While ISP integrates several digital tools into its workflow including AI-powered Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) models via Transkribus, dataset management through GitHub, and the use of TEI files for encoding transcriptions‚Äîhuman scholarly expertise remains essential. It is ultimately through careful philological analysis and contextual knowledge that accurate identifications of fragments and manuscripts are made. Digital tools enhance our capabilities, but it is human intelligence that guides interpretation and meaning.

#Concluding Words The Syriac fragment housed in the Turpan Museum offers a rare and meaningful glimpse into the vibrant liturgical life of Syriac Christianity along the Silk Road. 

Its identification achieved through human memory and scholarly expertise highlights the importance of traditional philological skills in our digital age.

#For those looking to AI to solve all their manuscript problems, this case serves as a timely reminder: while artificial intelligence holds immense promise for accelerating manuscript research, it cannot replace the depth of insight and intuitive connections that human scholars bring. The future depends on a collaborative model, where AI supports rather than supplants scholarly discernment. 


As we continue refining these technologies, let us not forget the unique interpretive capabilities of the human mind.

Just as crucial is the engagement with heritage scholars those deeply familiar with living Syriac liturgical traditions. Their insight is essential to identify and describe texts that remain in active use. 

To fully appreciate the significance of this Turfan fragment, I encourage interested readers to attend a Ramsho(evening prayer) service in a Syriac church, where the liturgy traditionally concludes with the Sutoro prayer including a full recitation of Psalm 91. Hearing these words chanted in a living community brings the ancient Syriac fragment to life in ways that no algorithm can replicate!

#Syriac in Central and East Asia
By Fred Aprim May 2, 2025

https://www.atour.com/media/files/forums/20250503072857.pdf

The Syriac Aramaic alphabet took the long eastward journey from the Levant üá∏üáæRaqqa & Upper Mesopotamia to Baghdad, Iran, Central Asia, Mongolia, & China all along the Silk Road, where it played a significant role in the spread of Christianity across the Mongolian and Chinese empires. 
Assyrian Christian members of the Church of the East brought their language and alphabet with them when they established a community in
the Tang dynasty‚Äôs capital city, Chang‚Äôan (Xian). Their most famous monument is a stone
inscription erected in AD 781 with both Chinese and Syriac inscriptions.

The Turkic-speaking Uyghurs adopted and modified the Syriac alphabet and it was Uyghur
scribes that brought literacy to the Mongol empire of Genghis Khan and his successors. In 1208
Genghis Khan defeated the Turkic tribes known as the Naimans who lived in Central Asia, and
captured one of the Uyghur scribes and eventually adapted the old Uyghur alphabet to write old
Mongolian.


The Uyghurs, also spelled Uighurs, are a Turkic ethnic and cultural group that originated from
Central and East Asia. The Uyghurs are concentrated in the Uyghurs Xinjiang autonomous
region in Northwest China. The Uyghurs did convert to Christianity around the 7th and 8th
centuries with the missionary efforts of the Church of the East. However, they slowly began to
convert to Islam in the 10th Century and many of them became Muslims by the 16th century.
While most of the Uyghurs still exist in China‚Äôs Xinjiang province; however, Uyghurs today
could be found in other Turkic countries such as Uzbekistan üá∫üáø, Kazakhstanüá∞üáø, Kyrgyzstanüá∞üá¨, Turkiyeüáπüá∑ and other Asian countries.


The old Uyghur alphabet was used as the Uyghur‚Äôs Turkic language from the 8th or 9th century
which is influenced by the Syriac alphabet of the Church of the East because of the said church
missionary work. This continued until around the 18th century. This language was spoken in
Turpan and Gansu in northwestern China, and it is considered as the ancestor of the modern
Uyghur language. Interestingly, the old Uyghur alphabet that was developed from the Syriac
(Aramaic) alphabet is written from left to right and in vertical columns unlike Syriac, which is
written from right to left in horizontal lines.
Above, examples of modified Syriac, old Uyghur, inscription on various temples in Beijing, China üá®üá≥



The Church of the East (later Assyrian Church of the East), erroneously labeled as the Nestorian
Church, played a major role in the spread of the Syriac alphabet in Central Asian countries as the
church spread from Cyprus in the Mediterranean to China. It is for this reason that Assyrians feel
a connection to the Turkic people of Central Asia and the Mongolians who adopted the
Assyrians‚Äô alphabet.


Dr. Stephen Andrew Missick states, around the year 1000 AD the Mongol tribe of the Keriats
became Christians. The tribe numbered over 200,000 men. The story of their conversion was
recorded by the Jacobite Bar-Hebraeus and by the ecclesiastical chronicler of the Assyrian
Church and can be found in ‚ÄúThe Eclipse of Christianity in Asia by Laurence E. Brown‚Äù. The
chieftain of the Keriats became lost in the wilderness during a hunt and despaired for his life.
Suddenly an apparition appeared before him. The supernatural being identified himself as Saint
Sergius and promised to show him the way home if he would place his faith in Jesus.


Miraculously the chieftain found himself back in his camp. Immediately he sent for some
Assyrian merchants he knew of and when they arrived he submitted to Christ and requested
religious instruction. This incident shows that Assyrian merchants and traders participated in
spreading Christianity as they bought and sold along the Silk Road.


#Dr. Nicholas Al-Jeloo details how wide spread Syriac alphabet and this church were during
certain periods of the Mongols. He states, Rabban Sauma (1220-1294) and his disciple Marcus
(later Mar Yahballaha III (1245-1317) hold prominent place in the medieval history of the
Church of the East. 

#Both belonged to the Turkic ”¶ngg√ºd tribe, which is part of the Mongol caste
under China‚Äôs Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) and sometime after 1275 they made their journey west
from their monastery near the capital at Khanbaliq (present day Beijing) to conduct a pilgrimage
to the Church of the East holy places in Mesopotamia and eventually Jerusalem in 1280;
however, they were prevented from completing their spiritual journey due to conflict between the
Mamluks and Mongols in Syria, so they retired to a monastery near Erbil.



In 1281, Marcus was elected to replace the deceased Patriarch Dinkha I. He led the church for 36 years. In 1287, his master Rabban Sauma was chosen by Il-Khan Arghun (1284-1291) to lead a
diplomatic mission to Europe‚Äôs religious leaders. Sauma visited Constantinople after Italy and
France returning to Baghdad the following year. The details of both Rabban Sauma and Mar
Yahballaha III lives are travels are preserved in a 14th century text which has been studied
extensively.

The old Uighur-Mongolian script, which is being reintroduced at this time as Mongolia‚Äôs main
writing system, was developed directly from Syriac through the, now extinct, Sogdian alphabet.
Even with the old Mangolian being written vertically, it still resembles the Syriac language.
Al-Jeloo states we know today that 2 wives of Genghis Khan were members of
the Church of the East: Ibaqa Beki daughter of Jamukha of the Keraite tribe and Ju‚Äôerbiesu of the
Naiman tribe and the other Khulan Khatun, of the Merkit tribe. The main wife of his eldest son
”¶gedei Khan named T√∂rgene who belonged to the Naiman tribe was a member of the Church of
the East. 

Another of his sons, Jochi, was married to Begt√ºtmish, Ibaqa Beki‚Äôs sister. Their father
Jamukha was a son of Keraite leader Cyriacus Buyruk Khan, son of Marcus.As for Genghis
Khans daughters, one of them, Alakhai Bekhi, was married to ”¶ngg√ºd Prince Boyaohe, son of
Alaqush, who belonged to the Church of the East. Another daughter T√ºmel√ºn, married Chigu,
son of Anchen of the Khongirad tribe and their daughter, Qutui Khatun, was one of the main
wives of Hulegu Khan and a faithful member of the Church of the East.


As for Kublai Khan, he was the son of Genghis Khan‚Äôs youngest son Tolui Khan and
Sorghaghtani Beki, the sister of Ibaqa Beki and Begt√ºtmish. Two of Kublai Khan stepmothers
were also members of the Church of the East. The most important of these was his second cousin
Doquz Khatun, daughter of Uyku/Abaqu, son of Toghril, who was his grandfather Jamukha‚Äôs
brother. After Tolui‚Äôs death, she married Kublai‚Äôs brother Hulegu Khan (her stepson), who
founded the II-Khanid dynasty in Persia and Mesopotamia. The other stepmother was Linqgun
Khatun, daughter of Kuchlug, another member of the Church of the East who was the last leader
of the Naiman tribe and final emperor of Qara-Khitai‚Äôs Western Liao dynasty. More importantly,

Kublai Khan;s daughter Yuelie (from his wife Chabi) was married to his first cousin Aybuqa,
son of Prince Boyaohe and Alakhai Bekhi. In their turn, Yuelie and Aybuqa were the parents of
Prince George, who left the Syriac inscription in western Mongolia in 1298, as well as princess
Sarah, for whom a Syriac Gospel manuscript (now in the Vatican Library) was copied in gold
ink that same year.

This influence of the Church of the East and its Syriac language and alphabet tapered down with
the rise of Islam. Syriac was associated with Christianity and as more people of Asia converted
to Islam, the use of Syriac diminished. Today, Syriac language and alphabet is used strictly in

my mother hounded me every step of the way while i was looking for apartments and during the moving process. she had every reason from the economy to how now she‚Äôd have to take the family dog out in the rain to make me feel guilty about leaving. but i had spent all of college carefully separating myself from her financially so she would have no way to stop me, and it worked. i am so proud of myself and how hard i worked to get here. i am so grateful for this shitty apartment. i am so excited for my life to finally start.

English is not my first language so, sorry if this sounds confusing. I think a little bit of backstory is needed. Me,(25f) and my best friend (26f) currently live in the same city that we initially came because of our education. I live with my family and she had roommates. For about 2-3 years we always talked about living together and how awesome it would be and had conversations where we would say i think we could do it in the near future when i could get a job after my masters etc. Our dream became reality when her roommate told her she is getting married over the summer and around the same time i found a job, so we decided that we would live together after my 3 month trial period at my job.

Around the time we officially decided that we would live together is when I started to hang out with her bf lot more with my bf(with her ofc). I met him couple of times before and he seemed like a cool dude at first (they started dating around 8 months ago). As I get to know him I started to dislike him more because he has some abusive tendencies towards her. I voiced my opinions to my best friend multiple times and she told me that she also recognizes but they are working on them because they love each other and willing to put the work on the relationship. She was unwilling to see her bf‚Äôs wrongdoings or she often finds excuses for him. Thats around the time doubts about living with her appeared in my head and i dismissed them, i said when he comes i could just say hi and go to my room or go to my bf‚Äôs home. 

Our dream of living together is all crashed last week when we met and grabbed a coffee. She told me that around 4 months ago he came to her and said he had a lot of debt and can she take out a loan for him because banks does not give him loans anymore and she said yes. They took out a loan with her name, that is 2 times his debt. Instead of paying his debt they gambled with it all and naturally, lost it all. After losing all of the money, they took another loan  and paid for his debt. But her debt is now 6 times more than his initial debt and all in her name, and she couldn‚Äôt pay the monthly installments for the debt around 3 months now. I was infuriated for her. As for her, she says that she loses sleep over her debt, she wishes she didnt take the loan but still giving excuses for him. She even told me that he could just leave but he didnt because he loved her. He even told her that ‚Äúyou can understand how much I love you bc if i didnt, technically it is your debt, i could just change my phone number‚Äù and she told me this as a excuse that he is a good partner. I told my family and my bf about this and they are all against me moving in with her and i lowkey agree but I feel like Im abandoning her, I love her to pieces i dont want to let her down because Im her only shot at staying in this city. I dont mind living with my family, i love my family it can get annoying sometimes but its not an issue. She can‚Äôt move out on her own, she cant afford it she is also unemployed (she quit her job around a month ago bc her workplace was awful) she is looking for jobs but is not going well so far.  She is sending me houses that are up for rent and hyping me up but i just feel sad. I dont know how to approach this topic, I cant say no to people, Im quite the people pleaser. I need to get this situation sorted because Im on my 2nd month of my 3 month trial and i got the okay that im going to be an official employee but i cant say that im happy for it.",1,1747337857.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Can understand why this is only in the candy pack.the flavors of orange and red berries doesn't really mix together well and just tastes a bit off

16.gummy bear
Maybe I just got a bad pod but this one just kind of tastes of chemicals with no real gummy bear taste, but ut did have a bit of sweetness

15.cherry
It does taste of the most chemical of cherry. Reminds me of how a cherry air freshener smells and just isn't very enjoyable to drink

14.banana shake
I do love banna flavors and this is a pretty good one. It just doesn't mix well with water at all

13.blueberry shake (after this point I find every pod enjoyable)
This one tastes pretty good I'm just not a fan of blueberry flavors.

12.apple
It tastes like the general idea of apple.
Pretty nice bit also a bit boring

11.tropical sunset
Tastes like mango passion fruit with a bit more zing. Consider this where id also place mango and passion fruit

Tastes like ribena but I find it a bit too strong for my tastes

8.peach.
I don't like peaches so this one surprised me, very nice flavor that makes the water feel smooth

6.wild berry
This is definitely a top tier flavor I just get bored if it pretty fast. Very nice berry flavor.

Bubblegum is always my favorite flavor if most things and that's almost the same with pods I just find it a bit too strong at first, still lovely

1.blue raspberry 
Suprised by this one. Hated it at first but after a little bit it became this really mice berry flavor. Almost better than the slush.

The last 3 not so great. I've been trying to make it work and I do believe he has love for me still, But  safe to say things have changed. My concern here is that about a year ago he started leaving for work 2 to 3 hours early every single day. Note as well that he works 7 to 10 minute drive away for where we live. He claims that he just likes to get some coffee and play on his steam deck before clocking in for his shift. I believe him sorta but sometimes I get in my head about it. He also tends to rush out of the house as if he's go to be late even tho his shift doesn't even start for 3 hours! 

I'm not trying to be an untrusting gf but when things seem odd how can I not speculate. It might also be different if I felt like he still wanted this. In the beginning when I felt love from him I was never with doubts or jealousy because I felt secure. Hes lost interest in me over time and I think he just expected things to always stay in that ""beautiful honeymoon phase"" of early relationship bliss and when I didn't meet those expectations he realized maybe he wants different. And yet won't leave even tho I've told him he's free to leave. It's all deeper and more complex but the main thing I'm wondering about Is he cheating? Should I just leave it alone and not bug him about it? He's even said things before like ""you can come with me and see what I'm doing"" I don't want to do that or follow him lol I'm not a stalker lol I just want to understand why. 

He says that he has a lot of anxiety since his father passed away and I'm trying sooo hard to be his place of safety and comfort but for whatever reason he's never leaned on me like that. He'd rather go sit in a cold wearhouse to drink coffee and play video games. He comes home on the dot everyday and I have no other reason to think he's cheating. I just what to know what the people think or how you would handle it? Would you truly not think it's weird?

Edit: id also just like to add that I give him space and privacy to play games all day long. I go to bed early and let him have alone time and we have different days off so it's not like this is the ""only free time"" he gets when he leaves early like this ya know.

TLDR: partner leaves for work 3 hours early everyday to get ""coffee",1,1747337556.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I just want to share what has been happening to some people that can understand.
The past 3 months have been nothing but dr visits, stress, extreme pain and discomfort with moments of contentment and peace when doing what I love. 
I am a barista at a very busy cafe. I love coffee, customer service, my coworkers, but gradually my body has become fatigued. When i first started working there, id leave my shifts in intense pain and was told it was normal and that my body just had to adjust to standing for long hours. A year and a half later, im still sometimes limping home. My heart rate stays above 110 bpm for the entirety of the shifts.
I know that it is damaging my health to work on my feet, and i have been trying to find a job that i can sit at. But right now i am only diagnosed with POTS. 
The good news is that my new dr, who i met with for the first time today, is much more interested in figuring me out than my last pcp. He is theorizing that i have ulcerative colitis or chrohns. If he can find the diagnosis and treat it, i will probably sob in joy knowing my symptoms of my entire life have been figured out.
I guess I'm just very worried about how much more work i will miss before i find a new job. Right now, ive missed at least one shift a week for the past two months. It is actually a miracle that I haven't even received a warning. I'm so thankful for my boss. I feel awful leaving my coworkers hanging with the sudden call-outs and sometimes i wish i could personally tell each of them that i am sorry and why it keeps happening.

I know that the probability of whatever condition i have being curable is low. However, i am hopeful that accommodations can be made for me to have a more peaceful life once i get a diagnosis.

It is so intuitively obvious that we *do* have free will that literally everyone (including those who say we don't) actually believes that we do.  Imagine pouring a pot of hot coffee slowly over the head of someone who denies free will.  He will be angry at *you* afterward, not the coffee nor the pot, because he knows full well that you chose to pour coffee on him and so are rationally the object of his anger.

Thus, the burden is clearly on those who deny it, and how will they shift this burden?  Not by reason.  If they are right, then we don't hold our beliefs as rational choices among competing possibilities.  We are forced to believe what we do without regard to the truth of the beliefs.

TRAINING & PRE-RACE

This was my first 100 miler. I ran it with an Indianapolis friend and a Texan friend, both of whom had run 100 milers before. My friends‚Äô goals were to finish sub-24. My goal was simply to finish. With their prodding, we finished together at 23:56:17. I am eternally grateful for their shepherding. My Indy friend and I primarily trained on trails in pre-dawn darkness to acclimate ourselves to avoiding tree roots in the dark while fatigued. We ran a hilly 100 kilometer race together in December of 2024, where I finished but failed to keep up, which hurt my confidence and renewed my focus on hills and distance during training.

My friend and I flew into San Antonio Thursday before the race to meet our friend who was also running. We stayed overnight at his house Thursday night. Friend‚Äôs dad graciously drove us to Huntsville in his RV. Arrived in time to walk around, set up our canopy, grab our bibs, and attend the pre-race briefing. The 2024 race was apparently quite muddy, and much of the briefing was to laud folks who made the 2025 possible. After the briefing, our RV driver extraordinaire grilled venison backstrap steak seasoned with olive oil, salt, and pepper to simple perfection. We devoured the steaks with chili ‚Äì bold choice ‚Äì and leftover casserole. After dinner, we assembly-lined PB&J‚Äôs for the next day. Around 10, we started settling in and divvying up sleeping surfaces. Our driver took the RV‚Äôs master chambers. I took the couch and my buddies each had floor mattresses. I thought I‚Äôd won the bedding sweepstakes until I realized the couch‚Äôs surface leaned toward the floor a tad. I was so nervous, I doubt I would have gotten much sleep anyway.

¬†

DAY OF:

After a fitful night of sleep, I awoke around 04:30. We shuffled around the RV making a breakfast of oatmeal and drank lots of water and coffee. It was a brisk, so I started out with a light 2XU running jacket over my Patagonia lightweight running shirt. I strapped myself into a hydration vest and brandished a 14 oz handheld for good measure. We organized our bounty of fruit, PB&J‚Äôs, Pringles, water, and decaf Tailwind, and made our way to the start line.

¬†

LOOP ONE (4:00:50)

We started out hot but almost didn‚Äôt start at all. One of my friends went to the aptly named honey buckets, and my other friend and I waded into the sea of starters. About three minutes from the starting gun, I realized we‚Äôd forgotten our ankle bracelets. My friend and I ran to the lodge, hurriedly put on our anklets and rushed back in time to cross the start line with the backliners. After working through the opening bottleneck, we found our groove before the first aid station. The thing I loved most about the Rocky loop was the pine needled downhills. We ran conservatively on the flats, walked uphill and while eating, and let loose like kids on the downhills, which felt great in the larger context of conservative running. We made it back to our canopy feeling great.

¬†

LOOP TWO (4:28:47)

My enduring memory from the second loop is that the temperature had increased a bit and my body had certainly warmed up but I imprudently kept on my running jacket. No big deal, but that lead to a sweatier experience. We still felt good running but my right ankle started hurting around mile 34. Even though it was early in the race, I wasn‚Äôt concerned, as I had heard that different pains would cycle in and out throughout a 100 mile effort. I must hat tip the aid stations ‚Äì at each stop, volunteers were lined up and ready to refill our water & Tailwind, give us food, and generally emanate positive vibes. Our goal was to never linger at an aid station but to zip in and zip out ‚Äì that meant arriving into the aid station with our bottles open and no standing & eating; we grabbed food and walked out while eating. We really hit our groove in the second loop. My Indy friend, our de facto leader, generally stayed a few steps ahead, while my San Antonio friend and I jabbered about movies, family, etc. From time to time, my San Antonio friend or I would run up to pace the group. We congratulated each other any time any one of us had to relieve ourselves, taking it as evidence of proper hydration. The heartiest congratulations were reserved for ‚Äúbig jobs.‚Äù

¬†

LOOP THREE (4:54:14)

I changed socks and removed my running jacket for the third loop, hanging the latter on a canopy pole to dry. Major kudos to the Patagonia Capilene Cool Lightweight shirt ‚Äì it‚Äôs silky, light, and impeccably breathable. Perhaps high on endorphins, I waxed poetic about this shirt to my friends for a good five miles. This was also a pivotable loop for me because I proved to myself that I could keep up with my friends, which I failed to do in the 100K we ran. I‚Äôm burying the lede here, but February 1, the day of the race, was also my late father‚Äôs birthday. That weighed heavily on me throughout the day and my friends made sure to tell me from time to time how much Larry Jo would be proud of my progress.

¬†

LOOP FOUR (5:14:59)

Before the race began, we applied a Texas Hold ‚ÄòEm motif: the first three loops were ‚Äúthe flop,‚Äù the fourth was ‚Äúthe turn,‚Äù and the final loop ‚Äúthe river.‚Äù For me, the race began with ‚Äúthe turn.‚Äù One hundred kilometers was the longest I‚Äôd run at one time before Rocky; as my Indy friend observed by way of Samwise Gamgee, ‚Äúone more step, I'll be the farthest away I've from home I've ever been."" This was also the loop we wore our lights, as it would be dark by the time we finished the loop. We also changed socks again and two of us, including me, changed shoes. I switched from Saucony Endorphin Speed Rifts to Altra Mont Blancs. As I entered one aid station wearing a Fenix light on my head and two headlamps around my torso, a rangy Texan in a cowboy hat looked me up and down, chuckled, and intoned, ‚Äúthose roots don‚Äôt stand a chance.‚Äù I downed a Five Hour Energy at the beginning of this loop and I am told my speech became euphoric and sentimental, though I have no such recollection. I do recall fatigue setting in big time the second half of this loop. I had banged my left foot a few times and my big toe was throbbing but it wasn‚Äôt until banging it a few more times this loop did it become a mental block and, at times, I would run tentative. My right hip also started hurting but I knew the pain would likely pass. I had to remind myself that I trained in the dark on trails lined with tree roots for this very reason. It had been such a successful effort thus far but doubt began to creep in.

¬†

LOOP FIVE (5:17:27)

Our camaraderie was the driving force for the first four loops, but it truly carried me during the final loop. My legs ‚Äì shin splints, I think, which I had never before experienced ‚Äì were also hurting with each foot strike. Knowing we were on the last loop, I just accepted the pain and trudged on. I felt OK the first half of the last loop but started to unravel at the 93 mile mark. I slowed considerably and started veering off the trail in a diminished¬†mental state.¬†

¬†

My San Antonio friend saw what was happening and stayed back with me and encouraged me by telling me how good I was doing, how proud he was of me for staying with them, and inviting me to reflect on the race thus far. He told me to lead for a bit and then he would lead for a bit if I veered off the trail. His encouragement meant everything in the moment.¬†My Indy friend, meanwhile, pressed on 150 or so yards ahead out of sight. We heard him shout, ""let's go,"" ""what's going on back there?,"" and ""dig deep!"" It would take a seriously strong push and increased pace to finish sub-24.¬†By this point, San Antonio and I had caught up with Indy but I began falling behind once again by about 40 yards. I thought of telling the guys that they should press on for the sub 24 finish and that I had given it my all and would make it when I made it but, selfishly, I too knew that sub 24 was still in reach, albeit¬†not without a strong finish, so I pressed on remaining 40 or so yards behind. This particular stretch was strewn with exposed roots and swampy ground.¬†

¬†

San Antonio kept shouting encouragement and noted upcoming roots while My Indy friend demanded that I ""dig deeper"" and increase my pace. I needed both their¬†approaches to finish strong and will be forever grateful to them for them pulling me along. I stared straight ahead and didn't respond verbally because I wanted to conserve all energy for the final mile or so, which was up a sandy hill, across a trail road, around a lodge, and through a winding grassy park to the finish line.¬†When we hit the sandy¬†path, I gave it everything -- indeed, even more than I thought I had to give. Accelerating¬†on this final stretch, my face involuntarily gave way to a fierce grimace and, thinking about my dad, I started sobbing audibly. I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't leave it all on the trail during the final stretch. I caught up with San Antonio and Indy up the sandy path. They reacted by cheering me, telling me how proud they were, and how excited they were that we were all going to finish together.¬†

¬†

Nothing could dampen my spirit or pace at this point; I was digging deeper than I thought was possible and was riding the high of finishing with my friends. We crossed the road -- in my stupor, I took the lead and promptly led us in the wrong direction, which my friends quickly¬†corrected. We ran giddily around the lodge after an onlooker told us we were on pace to finish in under 24 hours and exclaimed we were running like it was our first lap.¬†

¬†

We made our way through the winding park and, as we approached the finish line, Indy instructed us to join arm-in-arm and demanded that I take the middle spot. As soon as we crossed the finish line, I felt a vast release and immediately¬†started weeping and pumping my fist triumphantly. I turned to hug my friends. San Antonio, tearing up, said, ""Mark, now we are brothers."" Indy, for his part, said, ""Mark, I didn't take you for being so dramatic."" We finished the Rocky Raccoon, arm-in-arm, with three minutes and 43 seconds to spare before exceeding what became our shared goal.¬†It was a remarkable day that I will treasure forever.

¬†

AFTERMATH & FINAL TAKEAWAYS

After finishing, we sat for a moment and then packed our stuff, tore down our canopy, and headed back to the RV. Walking was tolerable but climbing the steps into the RV was brutal. We ate whatever we could find in the RV ‚Äì jerky, chips, candy, you name it. I laid down on the couch and elevated my legs but, in the coming days, I would experience so much swelling in my¬† lower legs and feet from fluid buildup that I had to buy larger shoes. In fact, the most comfortable footwear post-race was my trusty pair of fuzzy tiger slippers. After sleeping a bit, we craved Cracker Barrell. But, hilariously, we couldn‚Äôt fit our RV into any of the Cracker Barrell parking lots we tried. We ended up going to a Buc-ee's, where I had the best brisket sandwich imaginable.

Final thought: Training means everything. Training over long distances in the dark gave me a base ability to tap into when things felt dire. But friendship means even more. A few days before departing for Texas, I did not feel confident I could keep up with my more experienced friends and doubted whether I could even finish at all. I conveyed some of this doubt to my Indy friend. He told me to call him. I stepped out of my office to give him a call. A few days after returning from Rocky, a coworker put it best: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt know if you could do it but then your friend gave you the pep talk. That changed everything. I could see it on your face when you returned.‚Äù",19,1747337011.0,Ultramarathon,1,0.95,False

My boyfriend is turning 28 soon, and as the overthinker I am, I‚Äôve been struggling to pick the perfect gift. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here‚Äîhoping to get some help making up my mind!

To make this easier, I‚Äôll briefly describe him first, then go over the gift ideas I‚Äôve considered so far. (I‚Äôm also attaching some pictures of those.)

He‚Äôs an electrician and truly loves his job. In his free time, he‚Äôs always fixing things‚Äîhe‚Äôs a real handyman. One of his biggest passions is working on his cars (he‚Äôs a BMW fan through and through). He also enjoys spending time with friends, eating out, and he‚Äôs a big BBQ and beer lover. One of his favorite shows is Mad Men. I remember he once mentioned he liked a painting that appeared in the series, though it‚Äôs a bit explicit‚Äîso I‚Äôm unsure whether it would be appropriate as a gift from his girlfriend.

Apart from any gift, I‚Äôve already planned to draw something by hand and give it to him in a postcard, and I want to bake him a cake too.

The struggle: choosing the right gift
At first, I thought about getting us tickets for a Candlelight rock tribute to Queen & The Beatles‚Äîsince he likes rock. But then I realized it might not be his ideal vibe, even if he enjoys the music.

So I changed direction. I‚Äôm now leaning toward making a DIY gift basket based on his passions. These are the ideas I‚Äôve got so far:

LED gloves ‚Äì I read these are great for electricians and installers. Hopefully useful for him at work!
Funny electrician T-shirt ‚Äì It includes phrases like ‚ÄúMultitasking Function,‚Äù ‚ÄúProblem Solver,‚Äù ‚ÄúLikes Beer,‚Äù ‚ÄúNeeds Coffee,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Sarcasm & Irony Inside.‚Äù He loves humor (including dark humor), so I think he‚Äôd find it funny.
I‚Äôd like to add something car-related too, and maybe a couple more small items. But honestly, I‚Äôm feeling very unsure about it all.

I‚Äôm attaching pictures of the T-shirt, gloves, the drawing I made, and the Mad Men painting he liked.

Then last week, he texted me asking if I wanted to hang out sometime. I had honestly never thought of anything happening beyond me just drunkenly rambling to my friend, and this honestly made me happier than I thought. I had always thought he was cute but was too shy to ever say anything. 

We saw each other twice this week at a friends party, but each time it was really awkward. The first time, we barely talked because we were in a group setting and are both shy, but once we left he mentioned seeing each other at another party later that week and then doing something with just us later on in the week. He asked for my number and then I didn‚Äôt see him until the next party. 

At this party, we didn‚Äôt really talk a lot again, and a soccer game was on which sparked this other girl to talk to him about it a little. I tried, but I know nothing about that game. I‚Äôm terrible and shy in groups when I like someone there, and so I probably didn‚Äôt really make an impression beyond being shy. He and his friend got me food and as I was leaving we stopped to talk while I was waiting for my friend to get her stuff. I wasn‚Äôt even drunk but I blacked out from nervousness and I know we didn‚Äôt talk about hanging out again. I sent money for the food and sent one of those gamepigeon games and he responded by sending it back. I sent another back yesterday and still no response! He hasn‚Äôt even liked my Instagram post. 


I am just absolutely humiliated. I wish I never drunk rambled, I wish he never texted me, and I wish I never went to those parties and probably came across as the most boring person alive and made him change his mind about us hanging out. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to hurt so badly, but I guess having the unexpected happiness of him asking me out got me excited and I thought our first time meeting afterwards would be alone and not in a room with a bunch of his friends and mine. I just wish I could have redemption or he would reply, but I genuinely think he changed his mind. I feel like the first person to ever have a date offer rescinded before it happens. I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôll ever see him in a group again, because what if he tells his friends how boring he was or how he changed his mind about me and I never get invited. This is just an absolute disaster and I wish I could reverse time and prevent this from happening.

*Stay Length: 5 nights*¬†

*No Preferred Club*

*Room Type: Partial Ocean View King*

*Trip Rating: 4/5*

*Resort Rating: 3/5*

Just came back from a trip to Punta Cana, truth be told I won‚Äôt be coming back. I‚Äôm a Black-American woman in my late 20s and a proficient Spanish speaker - definitely not fluent but if someone couldn‚Äôt speak English, I can communicate with them easily. I went to DR with my girlfriend, who is also Black-American. We‚Äôve gone to all inclusive resorts before (Jamaica and Cabo) but what inspired me to book a trip to Punta Cana in the first place was to go back to Macao Beach. I went there 11 years ago as a teenager while staying at another resort and dreamt of coming back as an adult.¬†

We DID enjoy our time there. We used Diamond Transfers to get us to and from the airport - they were great to work with and cost effective.¬† The food and drinks at the resort were okay, you get what you get with all inclusive resorts. The service was also okay, nothing amazing but nothing horrible.¬†

There are just a few reasons that have brought me to the conclusion that I will not be going back. But first, let‚Äôs discuss the pros:

1. Dreams Macao Beach is a beautifully designed resort, we didn‚Äôt feel left out of anything.
2. Housekeeping was on point! They cleaned twice a day which was a bit suspicious but hey I‚Äôd rather have them coming to clean a lot than not at all.¬†
3. The beaches were by far the #1 pro of this entire trip. Being able to go back and forth between our resort beach and further down Macao with the locals was a highlight of our vacation.¬†
4. The water park and lazy river was a 10/10

Now let‚Äôs discuss the cons:

1. **Slow restaurant service**; We stopped asking for breakfast mimosas because they would never come, we just stuck to bottles of water. We get it, the buffet I believe was the only open restaurant in the morning and everyone on vacation wants coffee, water, and mimosas so we understood that. But waiting 20-30 minutes to get service at night was a bit frustrating. I remember experiencing this during my first visit to Punta Cana when I was younger.¬†
2. **THE MONEY HUNGRINESS**; It was like every second we were telling people we didn‚Äôt want to buy an excursion with them, didn‚Äôt want to buy their cigars, didn‚Äôt want a picture with a lizard or parrot, didn‚Äôt want a timeshare etc. At times it felt like we couldn‚Äôt just relax away from very pushy vendors. The excursion we did end up going on was literally us transporting ourselves from money trap to money trap to money trap. By the time we got the hang of it, we bartered what we could, but still I spent too much money on bullshit for my liking. This was my fault but I bought overpriced liquor, cigars, and a torch lighter that I couldn‚Äôt take back with me (as a resort, why would you sell lighters your purchasers can‚Äôt even take back home with them?). This has never been an issue at resorts in other countries that I‚Äôve been to. It is egregious and it probably my main reason for not returning.
3. **The Aggressive Preferred Club Presence**; We did not get preferred because it didn‚Äôt look worth the extra cost. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good look to have your ‚Äúluxury‚Äù/‚Äúexclusive‚Äù upsell smack in the middle of the resort. The preferred pool is a small pool in the center of the resort, blocked off by security during the day which forces you to walk entirely around this section. It‚Äôs in the way when it doesn‚Äôt need to be and that‚Äôs clearly by design to ATTEMPT to spark FOMO. But that didn‚Äôt really work. The preferred beach area is also nowhere near the actual beach. The only adults pool was only accessible for preferred club members. I didn‚Äôt recognize there was a preferred club only restaurant.¬†

But, my best guess is that before the Preferred Club‚Äôs existence, all of these locations were regular spots for guests to enjoy but they wanted to jump on the opportunity to milk people for extra money. I understand having an upsell/club part of the resort but to have it in my face like this felt intentional and not in a way that actually made preferred club attractive. Just felt like there is no incentive for guests, except being put on display for all non-preferred guests.¬†

4. **Sexual Harassment**: Now this last one I may not have the correct cultural knowledge but it absolutely contributed to why we are not coming back. For context, a lot of staff thought me and my girlfriend were Dominican. I don‚Äôt know if this is the reason why or because we‚Äôre two women not accompanied by a man, etc. but we were opened up to a lot of unwanted advances, uncomfortable conversations, and sexual harassment predominantly on resort grounds. Male servers lingered too long, asked odd questions, etc. Male pool workers catcalled us in Spanish, whistled at us on the beach, etc. Speaking of the beach, in between the resort grounds and the other beach land on Macao, there was a man who would sit behind the palm trees and masturbate to us as we walked between beaches. We went to the beach three days, he was there beating his dick each of those three days. Even on crowded days at the beach, he made time to find us and beat his peepee in our face as we made our short walk back to the resort. He kept motioning for us to come up there and we got him to run away thanks to a security guard going in his direction one time. But we didn‚Äôt feel compelled to tell the resort security guard on the beach because he himself tried to make a pass at my girlfriend, and just stared at us for hours while we lounged on the beach in our bikinis (not the children in the waves, not the dogs, not the man in between beach grounds masturbating, just me and my girlfriend reading books on a chair). It was just uncomfortable - we‚Äôve been to resorts before and unfortunately we deal with this kind of stuff all the time in America, this was just, once again, egregious and wildly uncomfortable. It reminded me how quickly horny people can turn degenerate.

I have more cons that aren‚Äôt important enough to be given a number but are also reasons why I don‚Äôt want to come back: I had the worst brownie of my life at room service, some of the towels weren‚Äôt washed all the way some of them had dark brown stains on them, a lot of flies inside the restaurants, and I left DR with traveler‚Äôs diarrhea <3 (I got it the first time I went to DR so I honestly was waiting for it to happen again, I thought I was in the clear until my very last day)

All in all it wasn‚Äôt a miserable trip. Things could've been A LOT worse and I'm glad we and all of our belongings made it back safely and mostly healthy. We had a good time but for all of this, I‚Äôd rather go to a place where we both feel more safe and less like safes ba dum tisss. I‚Äôm hesitant about all inclusives moving forward but hopefully in the future we‚Äôll get back traveling to them again. I just need a break for now LOL.¬†

1kngrlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1kngrlw/a_post_modern_perspective_on_christianity/,A Post Modern Perspective On Christianity,"	I was atheist for most of my life so I apologize if there is offense found in this upcoming passage but this is what led to my conversion to Christianity. I am setting up an argument for the truth of Christianity from the fiction position while still asserting it as true. It sounds paradoxical but this is a new form of apologetics. Christianity has the Holy Trinity from Platonism. I am not an expert in anyway this is simply my argument for why Christanity is true I hope that these words are able to help you with your conversion or help those close to you better understand why some believe in the Word: Stay Blessed.

	Why are superhero movies so popular? They aren‚Äôt real but why are those stories worth so much to companies like Disney and Warner Brothers? Why has the story of the brave knight slaying a dragon and saving the princess such a classic story that we hear? I argue that it is because stories describe a level of realism that our mundane lives don‚Äôt.¬†

	What makes a story valuable? Is it how relatable it is? I believe that it is the truth of the human experience that underlies the story. This is a truth that is difficult to discern from our day to day lives as we like Sisyphus push our boulder up the mountain in hope of freedom. These stories are passed down generations because they have a meaning that is worthy of being told. This isn‚Äôt to diminish our day to day experience but to highlight how stories are trancendent.

	Have you ever told someone about your day and left out a detail or two? Is that lying or did you make a fiction about your day? Does the person who hears this story believe it is fact or fiction? Do they have a reason to doubt you? ‚ÄúI went to the coffee shop,‚Äù did you meet someone at the coffee shop? Is that an important note for the person recieving the message? This isn‚Äôt a moral hypothetical it is simply making the point that even we ourselves have a level of fiction to our lives but it is no less true.¬†

	We live in a data-driven, mass production society; where we are blessed enough to have the comfort not afforded to our ancestors. We can go to the store and purchase our food instead of needing to track, hunt and prepare it ourselves. We have refrigerators to preserve our food. We have medicine to cure many of the ailments that would have been a death sentence centuries ago. I mean the man who said you should wash your hands was laughed out of his field because who washes their hands before delivering a baby? This knowledge has been passed down and we don‚Äôt question its value or meaning; we accept it as fact and operate under that condition. I believe that while stories are different they are still related.¬†

	Again the focus is on the human experience which isn‚Äôt always simply summed up by a fact or retelling of a day. For us it a story across years. When you read a biography you aren‚Äôt observing their day to day life you are observing them overcoming major obstacles to reach the life that they lived. Fiction and Religion are able to do so on a grand scale: Universal, Metaphysical.¬†

	The first book mass produced is the Bible. It led to the beginning of serialized printing to be easy and brought the Word to the common man. It gave us stories such as Don Quixote, Crime and Punishment, Paradise Lost and the stories that we love today.

	Lets explore the Metaphysical: Why is there something rather than nothing? That is the question I started with. I wanted to focus on what if there was truly nothing in the beginning. The issue I run into is that there is no passage of time, or matter to be observed so I argue that nothingness itself is the first observer and I call this observation God.¬†

	There are many religions in the world. What makes Christianity true? I believe that fiction describes a level of reality that our mundane lives are unable to easily articulate. Why do we fantasize about the night in shining armor or the dragon guarding the gold because there is a deeper meaning to it. The Dragon is a challenge that must be conquored and the knight is each one of us every day. The Bible is deeper than that. It has been passed down for millennia. Kingdoms have been formed, families raised, cities dedicated to the truth behind those words. My mom reminded me of the story of David today. She told me that David‚Äôs goal wasn‚Äôt to beat Goliath persay but to win the King‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage. The ‚Äúfollow through‚Äù as she put it. This is a deep take away when it comes to accomplishing our goals because what is it for unless there is some form of reward after.¬†

	All of this isn‚Äôt to rehash the story of David, but to illustrate how the truth of the Bible is deeper than the secular perspective allows despite the secular position being formed by the works of the Church. Science used to be an affirmation of God not in opposition to it.¬†",1,1747336659.0,Christianity,4,1.0,False

We live in an apartment with a pretty small kitchen (relevant because there are not many outlets). We have traditionally had our coffee maker and toaster plugged into the same outlet, but recently, whenever we use the toaster it trips the GFCI outlet, even though we used to use the coffee maker and the toaster at the same time.

I tried cleaning out the toaster when the issue first began, which temporarily helped, but it has started happening again.

Any ideas about what is going on? My thought is that it must be the toaster causing the issue since cleaning it temporarily solved the issue, but the toaster still works if you try it on other outlets outside of the kitchen.

Any info/advice would be appreciated since I am clearly not an electrician.

He then went on a sabbatical for 4 months overseas. But we texted every. single. day. Some days, literally all day. It got incredibly flirty, suggestive, sexual before flowing away from that in about mid Feb, with just the flirting. It got deep, talked about family, future goals, kids, life, everything. We'd chat for hours. I feel like I know everything about his family. 

We met up the day he got back in mid April, and then a few days later he invited me to drinks with his friends. We both got drunk and he invited me back to his, but then halfway through making out sort of rejected me and said he didn't want to ruin being really good friends and complicate it and apologised. 

I was inwardly devastated but agreed, we still talk alllll day every day though, but obviously less connotation and more just friends but he does still tease me here and there and vice versa. He does seem pretty platonic in person, no touching or anything like that but we sometimes seem a little awkward and shy sometimes at work, but other times will sit and chat for 4 hours without coming up for air. 

He finds me at work all the time, as do i in reverse. He brings me coffee and snacks, sneaks me stuff when people aren't looking. I do the same. We have inside jokes. People have asked me if we're seeing each other because of how close we seem.

He invited me round his twice last week and cooked for me both times, which is a big hobby of his and has said its sort of his love language as is mine. 

The second time it was something slightly special (not everyday dinner) from the local farm shop and as we were eating he was saying how his 3 mates he was with when he got it all said their girlfriends asked them to go get it for a nice dinner, so he did the same thing a bunch of guys did for their partners, but with me? He literally invited me round for it, must have planned it in advance?   

He has confided things to me in the last week, about having therapy, his dad dying a few years ago, told me his future plans, how he worries he's over the hill at 36 and I reassured him he absolutely wasn't, asked me advice on his future; about whether he retrains in a different career, but then told me he's settled on buying a house in our town against moving abroad which previously he said he was set against. 

He did show me something on his phone a week or so ago while hanging out for dinner and while I was watching a hinge notification popped up. I think we both could sense the awkward and my change in tone and he sort of tried over talking for a bit, and then showed me something else a while later but had put his phone on do not disturb. The next time we hung out he didn't have it on DND and was happy to show me everything. He also never speaks about any other girls at all, and shuts down jokes about his dating life from his friends in group conversation so I feel he at least knows how I feel and doesn't want to hurt me? Not sure.

I'm just a little confused, I can't work out if he is hesitant because he's been hurt before, avoidant, sending mixed signals, literally just wanting friendship, likes the attention or I'm completely delusional. 

It does feel like it's naturally evolved the last week or two, even today he found me before and after work and even said he was gonna be out all day tomorrow but he'd come in early to say hi to me. That isn't just a friend is it? Like he isn't doing that for anyone else and neither am I?

1knglua,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knglua,Help me find gift ideas for my Boyfriend that make him feel cared & loved (28),"
Hello everyone!

My boyfriend is turning 28. As the over-thinker I am, I am struggling to choose one gift. That‚Äôs why I am posting here: I would love to get some help to make up my mind. 

In order to make it efficiently, I will describe him briefly in the following paragraph. Then, I will explain the gifts I considered and attach pictures.

He is an electrician, in love with his profession. In his free time, he also is a handyman and loves to fix things. One of the things he loves to fix are his cars, another big passion of his -just so you know, his favourite car brand is BMW. 
In his free time, he also loves to go out with friends and eat together. He is a beer lover and loves to BBQ -he does it. As a side note, one of his favourite series is mad men. Once he mentioned a painting he liked from that series, but it‚Äôs quite explicit so I don‚Äôt think it will be a good gift from his girlfriend.

As I said at the beginning, I was looking for gifts for him. Also, I already have a handmade drawing in a postcard, and I also wanted to bake him a cake. 

BUT, here comes the struggle:

At first I thought, since he likes rock & roll, to buy him tickets for the candlelight tribute to Queen & The Beatles. Then I regretted this, since I know he likes rock, but not necessarily this environment.

But I changed my mind.I thought it‚Äôs better to make a DIY gift basket based on his passions. So far, these are my ideas:

-LED gloves: I read they are ideal for installers, electricians etc. I hope they‚Äôre useful.

-Funny electrician shirt: it describe electricians in a funny way (he loves humour, and dark humour too). In the shirt, the following things are writing, ‚Äúfunction multitasking‚Äù , ‚Äúproblem solver‚Äù, ‚Äúlikes beer‚Äù, ‚Äúneeds coffee‚Äù, ‚Äúattention: sarcasm & irony inside‚Äù.

Along these two gifts, I thought to add one related to cars and a few more. But TBH, I am feeling extremely doubtful about it. 

I‚Äôm attaching these last two gift ideas, the drawings and also the painting he said he likes once. 

I would love to be able to come up with a unique gift, with the ideas I have. Something that makes him feel cared and loved. Can I get some help, please?

I hunched over the laptop, trying to make sense of the spreadsheet open on the screen. Budget allocations. Client invoices. None of it meant anything to me, but I clicked, scrolled, highlighted‚Äîanything to look busy.

I could still feel the ghost of her touch on the cage, the sound of her heels echoing as she‚Äôd left the room. Every few minutes, I glanced at the door, half-expecting her to reappear. The tension in my chest refused to ease. My thoughts were split between the mind-numbing tasks and the storm of want building inside me.

After what felt like an eternity, the door creaked open again.

Mrs. Thompson stepped inside holding a tall glass of water and a single pill in her other hand. She raised an eyebrow at me.

""You look overwhelmed.""

I opened my mouth, but no words came.

""That's not a complaint,"" she added quickly, setting the glass and pill on the bedside table. ""That‚Äôs an observation. Take this. It'll help with focus.""

I stared at the pill.

""What is it?""

She leaned in close, her breath warm against my cheek. ""Nothing dangerous. Just something mild to keep your head where it should be. It‚Äôs what I used to give Jenny when she was cramming for exams.""

I looked at the glass, then at her. And I nodded.

""Good boy,"" she whispered.

I took the pill, swallowed it, and tried not to think too hard about what I‚Äôd just done.

She perched on the edge of the bed next to me, her eyes lazily trailing across the screen. Her perfume coiled in the air between us‚Äîsoft, intoxicating. She made a small noise of approval as I scrolled to the next email, fumbling through the content.

""You‚Äôre not as useless as you look when you're focused,"" she said, a teasing lilt in her voice.

I flushed, unsure whether to thank her or apologize.

She reached over and ran her fingers through my hair, gentle but firm. ""You don‚Äôt have to understand it all. You just have to do what you're told. You‚Äôre learning obedience. That‚Äôs what really matters.""

I shivered under her touch. It wasn‚Äôt just about helping anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even about Jenny. This was something else now. Something deeper.

""Tomorrow,"" she added, standing and straightening her robe, ""you‚Äôll come to my office regardless. Whether you finish this or not.""

I blinked. ""But you said‚Äî""

""I changed my mind,"" she interrupted smoothly. ""You clearly need more structure. A stricter environment.""

My throat tightened. ""What will I be doing there?""

She gave me a small smile, then walked to the door.

""Whatever I say.""

Then she was gone again.

I sat frozen in Jenny‚Äôs room, the laptop humming quietly on my lap, her mother‚Äôs scent still lingering in the air. My body was tense, mind a storm of conflicting emotions‚Äîconfusion, shame, anticipation, and something disturbingly close to thrill.

Mrs. Thompson‚Äôs last words echoed like a chime I couldn‚Äôt shut out:  
**‚ÄúWhatever I say.‚Äù**

I stared at the screen, but the spreadsheet blurred in front of me. I couldn‚Äôt concentrate, not with the cage pressing tight, not with the taste of that pill still on my tongue, not with the knowledge that tomorrow, I‚Äôd be entering *her* space. Her domain. Her office.

And I didn‚Äôt even know what she *did* there.

The next morning, I barely slept. I showed up at the address she‚Äôd sent me‚Äîa sleek office building downtown with mirrored glass and wide, echoing halls.

The receptionist didn‚Äôt even ask who I was.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here for her?‚Äù she said with a knowing glance, then pressed a button and gestured toward the elevator. ‚ÄúTop floor. She‚Äôs expecting you.‚Äù

My stomach twisted as I rode the elevator up. The pill had long since worn off, but the memory of her voice, her fingers, the weight of her expectations‚Äîthey hadn‚Äôt.

When the doors slid open, I stepped into a world I didn‚Äôt expect.

The office was spacious, softly lit, and silent. It didn‚Äôt look like a business environment at all‚Äîit looked more like a lounge, with velvet chairs, dark wood accents, and heavy curtains half-pulled across the windows. At the far end was a glass wall overlooking the city, and in front of it stood Mrs. Thompson.

She turned as I entered, smiling like we were old friends.  
‚ÄúThere you are,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúRight on time. Good boy.‚Äù

She walked to me slowly, heels tapping against the polished floor, and looked me up and down. I was dressed neatly‚Äîclean shirt, pressed pants‚Äîbut I still felt small under her gaze.

She gestured toward a smaller side room.  
‚ÄúLeave your things in there. You won‚Äôt need them.‚Äù

I obeyed without hesitation, placing my bag and coat down, and when I returned, she was already seated at a wide, low desk.

‚ÄúSit,‚Äù she said, pointing to the cushion on the floor beside her chair.

I did.

She handed me a tablet, already open to a document. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to proofread this proposal first. Then summarize the pitch in your own words.‚Äù

I glanced down at it. The text was dense‚Äîbusiness terms, strategy jargon, company names I‚Äôd never heard of. I swallowed. ‚ÄúMistress, I‚Äî‚Äù

Her hand was on my chin before I finished.  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask if you could. I said you would.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYes, Mistress.‚Äù

She released me, then leaned back and crossed her legs. I could feel her watching me as I worked, my fingers clumsy on the touchscreen. I tried to focus, to read and re-read every line carefully. But I kept stumbling, skipping words, second-guessing myself.

And the worst part? I could *feel* her amusement. She wasn‚Äôt helping. She didn‚Äôt *want* to help. This wasn‚Äôt about success. This was about *submission.*

‚ÄúYou look so concentrated,‚Äù she said softly after a while. ‚ÄúI like that. You‚Äôre starting to understand your place.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. I just kept reading, my face burning.

Eventually, she rose from her chair and walked behind me. Her hand brushed over my shoulder, then down my back. I tensed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not here to impress anyone,‚Äù she murmured, ‚Äújust to be trained. Shaped.‚Äù

A pause. Her fingers grazed the back of my neck.

‚ÄúDo you know what I used to do before Jenny was born?‚Äù she asked.

I shook my head carefully.

‚ÄúI ran an etiquette school. For wayward young men.‚Äù

I stiffened.

‚ÄúOh, not the kind you're thinking of,‚Äù she chuckled. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt about posture and forks. It was about obedience. Control. Teaching them to listen. To serve. *Willingly.*‚Äù

She crouched down beside me, her face level with mine. ‚ÄúI see the same potential in you.‚Äù

The tablet shook slightly in my hands. ‚ÄúMistress‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù

Her eyes searched mine, something sharp and unreadable behind them. Then, slowly, she smiled.

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre already halfway broken. Jenny saw it first. She just didn‚Äôt know what to *do* with it.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. My pulse pounded in my ears.

Mrs. Thompson stood and smoothed down her dress. ‚ÄúFinish this document. Then come kneel by my desk. You‚Äôll spend the rest of the day here‚Äîtaking notes, fetching coffee, obeying every instruction. Quietly. Completely.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd tomorrow?‚Äù I asked.

She didn‚Äôt turn back as she walked to her seat.

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou start learning how to serve *properly.*‚Äù

The door clicked shut behind her.

And I was alone with the silence, the work, and the slow unraveling of whatever self I thought I had left.",4,1747335770.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,1.0,False

1kngcbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1kngcbc/chapter_7_the_holy_requisition_of_thursdays_a/,[Chapter 7] The Holy Requisition of Thursdays: A Liturgical Comedy of Errors,"# Chapter 7: The Quiet Heresy (Reconsidered)

It began, as most eschatological legal procedures do, with a misplaced trumpet and a clerical error. The trumpet‚Äîassigned to herald the end of days‚Äîhad instead been scheduled for the Tuesday performance review of Saint Bartholomew. The error? God‚Äôs left hand had signed off on a metaphysical subpoena intended only for the right.

And so the stars dimmed, politely, and the courtroom convened.

The **Court of Cosmic Reconsideration**, suspended between Purgatory‚Äôs East Wing and the Department of Timeless Appeals, manifested overnight inside Theo‚Äôs dreaming skull. The walls were lined with witness boxes. Some witnesses were gods. Some were metaphors. One was Tuesday itself, curled in the fetal position and muttering about Gregorian overreach.

Theo stood before them‚Äîrobes wrinkled, stained with sacramental coffee, and visibly regretting at least three of his footnotes. His mitre was gone again‚Äîlikely unionized with the whispering headgear from Chapter 4. In its place: a sticky note slapped to his forehead reading:

> **Cleric-In-Contemplative-Holding**

Beside him, Crivens adjusted his wrinkled blazer, now fully embodying his new titles: *Legal Counsel*, *Prophet Wrangler*, and *Interdimensional Paperclip Specialist*. On his hand, St. Doubt blinked solemnly‚Äîone button eye replaced by a spinning wheel of liturgical chance, the other sewn shut with a red thread of unresolved interpretation.

---

## Summons by Synapse

The setting wasn‚Äôt accidental. This was the tribunal where **the Gospel of the Maybe**, last submitted through untraceable channels, would be judged for narrative eligibility. Theo had written something‚Äîpossibly in a dream, possibly between forms‚Äîand now it was on trial alongside him.

The bailiff approached‚Äîa hybrid of cherub and spreadsheet. Wings made of unread clauses flapped in anxious rhythm. Its gavel sounded suspiciously like a fax machine buffering through divine latency.

> ‚ÄúThis court is now in session. Case number Œ©-77: The Lamb of Peace v. The Vatican (et The Goat, et Theo, et Unnamed Forces of Chaos with Known Intent to Inspire).‚Äù

> ‚ÄúExhibit A,‚Äù the bailiff intoned, unrolling a scroll onto a hovering pulpit. ‚ÄúUnregistered metaphysical submission: codename ‚ÄòGospel of the Maybe.‚Äô Author: unclear. Tone: destabilizing.‚Äù

Theo blinked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not mine,‚Äù he whispered to Crivens.  
Crivens, without looking up, muttered, ‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs absolutely yours.‚Äù

---

## Opening Statements

Crivens stood. Cleared his throat. Wavered. Adjusted St. Doubt, who nodded with clerical uncertainty.

> ‚ÄúLadies, Lords, and Logics‚ÄîI present not a defense, but a confession. My client, Theophrastus Ignatius Crumble‚ÄîPope Involuntary, Accused Voluntary‚Äîis not guilty of clarity, nor of madness, but of **collision**. He is what happens when **metaphor and mandate** share a cell. When prophecy trips over its own footnotes.‚Äù

> He didn‚Äôt mean to write it,‚Äù Crivens continued, gesturing vaguely toward the scroll, ‚Äúbut neither did the burning bush. Divine accidents leave the deepest scorch marks.‚Äù

St. Doubt added‚Äîsoftly, and with Crivens‚Äô falsetto trembling:

> ‚ÄúWe also file a motion to redefine ‚Äòheresy‚Äô as ‚Äòdivinely premature insight.‚Äô‚Äù

The clouds of Pope Pius XII rumbled disapprovingly. A relic sneezed. The Concept of Sacrilege scribbled something down and immediately lost the page.

---

## The Goat Enters

From the back of the chamber, the Goat entered‚Äîhoofsteps echoing like reluctant thunder. It wore a necktie. It carried a manila folder between its teeth.

The Goat approached the judge‚Äôs bench, nodded once to Theo, and dropped the folder.

> ‚ÄúAmicus Brief from The Lamb.‚Äù

Gasps. Gregorian coughing. Somewhere, incense fainted.

The folder opened itself. Letters uncoiled. Not just the brief from the Lamb, but the **Gospel beside it**, now glowing faintly‚Äîits ink flickering between languages, as if unwilling to settle on one truth.

The words were paradoxes braided in flame. The brief argued that:

- Salvation was a paradox engine.
- Theo was not the Pope, but the shadow of the idea of papacy.
- The Goat was a **necessary narrative function** in an age of **theological entropy**.

It was compelling. It was heretical. It was‚Ä¶ coherent enough to cause a schism.

The judges conferred:
- They whispered through stigmata.
- They consulted the Book of Unwritten Futures.
- They paused briefly to ask an AI trained on Aquinas and Kafka for ‚Äúinterpretative mood board input.‚Äù

Then they called Theo to the stand.

---

## Theo‚Äôs Testimony

He stepped forward. His breath shook like a psalm at a parole hearing. One relic tried to lick him. He ignored it.

> ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for this. I didn‚Äôt seek it. I was just a man with bad knees, good intentions, and a curiosity for what faith looks like **after the cathedral crumbles**.‚Äù

He looked toward the Goat, then toward the empty space where his mitre used to hover.

> ‚ÄúBut then the Goat looked at me. And the world changed.‚Äù

A Pope-shaped cloud asked, ‚ÄúAnd do you believe the Goat is divine?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúI believe it is honest. Which is rarer.‚Äù

Another judge: ‚ÄúAnd the Lamb?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe Lamb is tired. It wants peace. It wants an end to being weaponized in the name of every holy war and sermon gone stale.‚Äù

The tribunal fell silent.

---

## Final Witness: The Concept of Sin

Sin took the stand in two forms:
- An unpaid parking ticket from 1994.
- A childhood memory of cheating at Monopoly.

It spoke with the voice of a locked diary:

> ‚ÄúI was never meant to last this long.‚Äù

---

## The Verdict

The cherubic bailiff returned‚Äînow with six arms and an abacus stitched from lost confessions. It read the ruling in a voice composed of string theory and regret:

> ‚ÄúThe court finds Theophrastus neither guilty nor innocent, but **necessary**.  
> The Goat shall retain narrative rights.  
> The Lamb‚Äôs brief is accepted into the Cosmic Archive.  
> The Vatican is to be reclassified as a **metaphor**.  
> The mitre‚Ä¶ may choose its own head.‚Äù

> The Gospel of the Maybe was not approved, nor rejected. It was archived. Footnoted. Whispered into the margins of scripture.

At this, one judge muttered:

> ‚ÄúLet it find someone it doesn‚Äôt have to haunt.‚Äù

Crivens nodded slowly, whispering with a smile:

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all precedented now.‚Äù

The gavel-fax chimed. The courtroom dissolved into a library of possible endings.

---

## Aftermath

Theo walked out into a world rewritten.

The sky was still open‚Äînot a wound, but a question.

St. Doubt waved a felt farewell, then vanished‚Äîone final note stitched to its palm:

> *‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to believe in the silence.  
> You just have to stop talking over it.‚Äù*

The Goat remained behind‚Äîfiling documents no one asked for, humming hymns that hadn‚Äôt been invented yet.

And far, far away, the Lamb curled up beside a campfire made of **absolved guilt** and finally‚Äîfinally‚Äîslept.

1kngc5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1kngc5v/storyline_ideas_that_have_kept_things_interesting/,"Storyline Ideas ‚ú® that have kept things interesting, especially in my legacy files!","1. With the new skill mentoring options, every single teen / young adult / adult / elder comes over after school if my sim is working or building their skills so a cousin, auntie, or grandma can give an after-school violin or piano or logic lesson. The schedule changes whether or not they‚Äôre involved in after-school activities, & the lesson will be over by dinner but it is so good for building relationships & skills simultaneously 

2. Especially after they introduced horses, i always have a farm within the family with horses for any kids growing up in the suburbs to take lessons. Whether the equestrian lessons are after school for a few days or they just move in with Grandma for the summer, it‚Äôs great for them to eventually compete & win without having to have the horses live on their property, & it‚Äôs cute to take the trophies back to their room after the summer. It‚Äôs like the movie Flicka where the mom chose a different life but the kids still go back to the farm 

3. Although it‚Äôs annoying, try to utilize holidays as much as possible, ESPECIALLY SUMMER / WINTER / FALL BREAKS. You don‚Äôt even have to do traditions, you can just check off that there‚Äôs no school or work. It‚Äôs relieving to have vacation time without needing to take the vacation

4. With as many skilled sims as possible, try to challenge yourself to fill the gaps in each career, especially the doctor career. When your sim arrives at the hospital in labor, & you have family members that are at different levels (i.e. nurse, receptionist, medical tech, doctor, surgeon, chief of staff) they may be staffed at the hospital when you have the baby. Also, the labor mod really gives you an immersive at-home option where having a doctor in the family makes it a special moment

5. Make a rescue vet clinic with low prices to compete with an upscale vet clinic, that way if down the line your sim needs to save money they have options

6. BB.ENABLEFREEBUILD
Make sure you get functional gallery replacements for the hospital, police station, etc but especially the high school. I personally revamped my gallery edit & found the perfect way to utilize essentially every skill. Now, the high school has:
Basketball court inside w bleachers & soccer field outside, outdoor food stalls with city recipe kiosks & picnic areas, a full yoga room next to a separate full-sized cheer room, a big gym that everyone can use in the morning or EOD, a separate boy / girl lounge with coffee, entertainment etc & photo booths, arcade games & karaoke machine outside of the gym & yoga area, a coffee / computer cafe separate from the lunchroom, a full debate stage with chairs for the audience, a police station for the sneaky lick trends, separate boy & girl locker rooms with showers, art, science, computer labs separate from the classrooms that lessons take place, as well as separate admin offices like athletics, guidance counselors, & the main office w the principal.

7. Separate Boy / Girl Uniforms for school everyday outfits to insinuate your toddlers are in montessori, & kids & teens are in private school, if you have different grades they can have different corresponding uniforms especially for specific colors (there are many cc creators that make private school uniforms)

8. In order to have a successful save, try to keep the generations alive to keep elders busy. Invite them over for stay overs to raise the kids non-stop, the growing together pack really changed elders

9. to differentiate age groups, have your oldest elders live in a retirement home (for rent needed) & give them clubs (get together) with activities like knitting or walking around San sequoia (growing together). Have them be differentiated from your younger elders that live in the suburbs by giving them more wrinkles or glasses or head scarves, & shorter thinner whiter hair

10. Open a RETAIL STORE w one of your fresh chef sims & make all of the city recipes so any of your sims can buy them & learn them on the spot. If you have dine out, you can do this with the experimental dishes as well, you just need the chef‚Äôs station from that pack to make them after you learn the recipe from ordering it at an experimental restaurant. Especially if you have a legacy save, it‚Äôs great to have sims you no longer use take over retail stores like this to keep it in business & not lose all of the recipes over & over again

11. A huge part of my legacy file has been ingratiating my innocent lineage with mafia figures in the criminal career & having the children of these resulting marriages either marry rival mafia figures & start their own lineage, or leave the life altogether & stop talking to the family members that are still connected. It‚Äôs interesting thru the years to see, for example, in 3 generations to see a successful criminal have multiple kids, the son inherits the business & gets help from his parents to raise the next mafia figures, while the daughter leaves altogether for a simpler life in the countryside & subsequently receives 0 support or visits from her criminally-connected family members, even during the worst financial constraints. Having different cousins & uncles in politics, law & order, law enforcement, etc makes things extra interesting when everyone is aligning each other‚Äôs pockets

12. Have struggling young families run small businesses like flower shops, wedding dress stores, or just utilize the idea of a walkable commercial space especially office buildings. Have a business park campus for important meetings or club gatherings

13. Make clubs for group gatherings like PTA moms, single dads, cheer squad (cheer practice can be everyday after school w that option) & make complicated social dynamic rules for each club, even if it‚Äôs a homeless group of teens that eats at bars & showers in gyms, the possibilities are endless

1kng9ne,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kng9ne,Advice needed: What Rug Format do I get?,"So I‚Äôm moving into my first apartment, I planned a bit ahead on a website with furniture and the layout. But I‚Äôm still not sure what rug/carpet will fit this living room corner the best. Personal I‚Äôd like to get one that covers the whole area, but the format would need to be 220x290cm, hard to get that one in an affordable price range. There will be a coffee table between those couches ofc. 
Would a smaller one, that just covers the area below the coffee table be enough, or will that seem ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù in any way?
Any alternatives?

And what colors would work?
I Plan on buying very color full posters/pictures, and some decorating with popping colors, like orange or blue maybe.


Added more pictures to get a feel of the room size

Feel free to let me know any advise or critique in any way regarding the layout or anything. Thanks!

I‚Äôm so done.,"I feel like I‚Äôm being slowly pushed out of the place I live, and I‚Äôm reaching my breaking point.

About six months ago, I escaped a toxic living situation where I was being used constantly‚Äîwatching kids, cleaning up after adults, doing dishes, laundry, etc., all while having barely anything of my own. I eventually moved in with a friend‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Mark‚Äîwho understood that I‚Äôm disabled (I have one arm) and that it‚Äôs harder for me to get a job, especially without a valid ID. He told me I could take my time getting on my feet, and once I got a job, I could pay $300/month. I took that deal and have been doing my best to move forward.

I was staying in a small room, and everything was fine for a few months. But about a month ago, a new guy‚ÄîCraig‚Äîmoved in. After only a few weeks, Mark told me that Craig would be getting my room because ‚Äúhe pays rent.‚Äù I was told I‚Äôd be moved into another room (a makeshift studio space) while I continued looking for work or found another place. But once Craig got the room, that offer was taken away. Now I‚Äôm expected to stay in the living room, which stays loud until 1‚Äì3 AM with drinking, music, and constant chatter. That‚Äôs not something I can mentally or emotionally handle‚ÄîI‚Äôm introverted, overstimulated easily, and just exhausted. So I moved all my stuff into the hot garage, where I‚Äôve been staying ever since.

I already had a bad feeling about Craig from the start‚Äîhe‚Äôs the one who took over my room‚Äîbut I tried to stay civil. Lately though, everything he does is driving me up the wall.

He drinks beer nonstop. First thing in the morning‚Äîno coffee, no water‚Äîjust beer. He burps loudly and on purpose, like he wants everyone to hear how gross he can be. When he goes to the bathroom, he grunts and moans so loudly it literally sounds like porn. You can hear everything splattering and echoing through the house. And he doesn‚Äôt even wash his hands afterward.

He works some call center job from his room, but every single time I go inside to make coffee, grab water, or use the bathroom‚Äîhe comes out. I swear it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs listening for me. He mumbles to himself, breathes with his mouth open, and always tries to start a conversation when I clearly don‚Äôt want to talk. I‚Äôve tried everything to make that obvious.

If I try to play on the PS5 to unwind, the moment he gets a break, he runs into the living room to take the TV‚Äîeven though he has two TVs and a computer in his room. He puts on one of his dumb shows for like 30 minutes, then disappears again.

This guy is 40. When he moved in, I overheard him talking about getting broken up with and left homeless. And honestly? I see why. He‚Äôs obnoxious, inconsiderate, gross, constantly drunk, and invading everyone‚Äôs space. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve been here longer, have done my best to stay quiet and respectful, and now I‚Äôm sleeping in a garage while he lives comfortably in my old room.

I‚Äôm doing everything I can not to explode on him, but I‚Äôm so tired. I feel completely disrespected and tossed aside like I‚Äôm nothing just because I didn‚Äôt magically land a job fast enough. I‚Äôve kept all this in for too long, and it‚Äôs eating away at me.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

I know I am (mostly) talking to the converted, and I will look into how-to change the laws which make ‚Äúexisting‚Äù a crime. 


The Sphere improves when people nourish themselves with the Dream to See the World.


Books like ‚ÄòFree Country‚Äô (2014, Mahood) and the old classic ‚ÄòThe Wonderful Ride: Being the true journal of Mr. George T. Loher‚Äô (1895) highlight how kind and generous estate/farm owners were/are. They may even become fascinated in your journey and appreciate you livening-up their Day. Some seem proud of their hard work on the Land, and like having new eyes to enjoy it.

So, asking seems like a good play. I have never asked permission.

I have ‚Äúwild‚Äù car-camped about 50 nights (6 cross-USA road trips), only negative contact was police (just outside Angeles National Forest) who registered me as a ‚Äúvagrant‚Äù (no fine) and told me to ask to park at a gas station. 


Vagrancy and Idle Laws reflect old-fashioned fear of roaming refugees descending on your parcel like hungry zombies.

How I do it:

Stop a good distance past your noted location for an ‚Äúoverall look‚Äù. Listen and feel the area. Is this spot deserted for the night; will there be morning activity?

If you are satisfied, turn-on your ‚Äòinvisibility power‚Äô and just go and dive in where you can be quickly out-of-view. After getting primarily out-of-view, slow down and move carefully (likely some surprises in there). Stop and sense if you have excited anybody  (dogs).

\~\~\~



SOPHIA WATCHED IN sheer horror as the nineteen-year-old familiar-looking stranger plunged the knife out of her mum's abdomen while she just stood at the bottom of the stairs watching everything. To say she was scared was an understatement.



They were just done having dinner-their small family; Her dad, mum, and herself she'd just gone upstairs to her room to get a broken doll that she could show her dad when she heard the sound of glass breaking. Clutching her broken doll, she rushed downstairs only to see her mum being stabbed by an unknown stranger and lying dead on the floor.



Her eyes searched for her dad but he was nowhere to be found.



Had he been killed too?



""You rascal!"", Sophia heard her dad's voice before he finally came into view. He gripped the stranger's collar and glared at him. ""What did you do to my security team? What did you do to my wife?"",



""I did what should have been done a long time ago"", The killer replied without any hint of remorse in his voice. ""And I'm ending this whole bullshit here"", The killer took Sophia's father by surprise and stabbed him in the chest and a small gasp left her lips. She watched as her dad's eyes filled with horror and his lips parted when the killer pulled out the knife forcefully and stabbed him again, making him cough blood until he fell with a loud thud on the floor, with life slowly slipping from his eyes.



From what Sophia's eight-year-old instincts told her, her dad sounded as if he knew the young man who had just killed him before that day.



Sophia's sobs from where she stood caught the attention of the killer and he glared at her with his dark and piercing eyes which were devoid of any emotions. He looked oddly familiar but she couldn't place out where she had ever seen him. Not when the whole light in the house was dimmed. The stranger didn't look away from her and it sent cold shivers down her spine.



Was he going to kill her too?



""Soph-"", She heard his voice as he calmly walked towards her. She was shaking and her lips were quivering. She knew her end had arrived as well but something told her to run.



When the murderer extended his gloved arms towards her, she ran back upstairs to her room, unsure if it was even safe for her. She hid in a corner and curled herself in a ball as the image of her mum's dead body on the floor and her dad's horror-stricken eyes flooded through her mind while unstoppable tears streamed down her face.



Her parents were gone and she was too young to be an orphan.



\~\~\~



""No please-mama-papa-don't go"", Sophia whimpered as she clutched onto the sheets with her fists. Her eyes were clenched shut and tighter than they should've been for someone sleeping while beads of sweat trickled down her face. ""Please-"",



""Wake up, Soph"", Someone shook her shoulders softly and her eyes flew open immediately. She sat up on her bed and began to search her whole room with fear evident in her eyes as she thought her parent's killer was there in the room with her. She hugged her knees as tears streamed down her face. She was a crying mess and her hair was probably sticking out all over her face. ""It's okay, my dear. It's just the nightmare"", Her grandma pulled her into her arms as she rocked her back and forth.



""Nana-"", She cried and looked up at her grandma with her big doe eyes. ""He-he-he isn't coming, right? He won't come near us, right? He won't-he won't kill us the way he he-killed Mama and Papa, right?"",



""No, my dear"", The woman patted her eighteen-year-old granddaughter's back softly. ""He won't find us"",



Sophia clutched onto her grandma tightly as the images flooded her memory. For the past ten years, she spent every single night of her life having nightmares about her parents' mysterious killer and she kept on wondering who he was. The tone in his voice while he spoke to her dad that night made her feel like her parents knew their murderer and maybe he had an unsettled score with them.



""Here, have milk"", Her grandma brought a glass of warm milk to her lips. Whenever she woke up every night after the nightmares, she always drank warm milk to soothe herself and help her calm down.



Sophia quickly drowned the whole glass of milk down her throat before her grandma took the empty glass from her lips and placed it back on the tray by her bedside table.



""It's going to be alright, dear"". Her grandma whispered.



""Thanks, Nana"", Sophia said too.



""Would you like to go back to bed?"", Her grandma asked.



""I'll try today"", Sophia whispered as she laid down on her bed and nuzzled herself in her blanket. She knew sleep had eluded her but she couldn't stress her grandma by telling her.



""Should I stay in here with you?"", Her grandma asked.



""Yes, please"", she croaked out.



With a small smile, Sophia's grandma slid into bed next to her and pulled her in her arms. ""Goodnight, dear"" "" the older woman whispered as she stroked Sophia's hair.



Sophia closed her eyes in an attempt to sleep but instead, all she saw was the dark and piercing emotionless eyes of that killer staring at her and she hated it.



Over the years, Sophia had engraved every single feature of his eyes in her memory because he was someone she wasn't sure she could ever forget. In other cases, it might not be extremely hard for people to forget the face of the person who murdered their parents but Sophia's case was different. Instead of forgetting the unknown murderer, she seemed to remember him more as each day of her life passed by. Who would ever forget the face of the person who made them an orphan?



As she thought about all these, she went down the memory lane of how her life had been for the past ten years since she lost her parents. That night when she ran to her room from the killer, he didn't follow her and a small part of her was grateful while the bigger part of her wished he had killed her along with her parents. At least she wouldn't have gone through the trauma she was going through. With a small sigh, she remembered how she stayed glued to that spot that night until the next day when her grandma took her away from the house while her parents were laid to rest.



Growing up after experiencing such was hard for Sophia but with her Nana, she was able to scale through some parts except the nightmares part. Her grandma made sure she went to school and at the age of eighteen, she was already a college student, so she had to work out her ass by working in a small coffee shop to assist her grandma with a few expenses.



\~\~\~



""Okay then, sir. Goodnight"", Sophia smiled at her boss.



""My regards to your Nana"", The burly man smiled back at her, and he left the coffee shop.



It was a long day and finally, she was about to close the shop since she was the one given the responsibility to do so. All she needed to do was clean up the tables and she'd go back home to her grandma.



And her nightmares.



Just as Sophia began to clean the first table, she heard the chime sound of the door, indicating that a customer had arrived.



Couldn't the person see the board outside which read 'closed'?



Sophia turned abruptly, ready to snap at the person but her words died on her lips as her eyes landed on the people by the door side.



A lady of about twenty-four or so and two young men of about the same age-maybe twenty-six stood there all clad in black by the door, looking deadly.



Who were they?



""Three cups of coffee, please"" "" the lady said and they sat on a table at a secluded corner close to the door side. Sophia watched as one of the men dropped a gun on the table in front of him and she gulped nervously.



Looking at the remaining two people's trouser holsters, their guns were strapped there and the aura they carried made Sophia sick in the stomach. She knew instantly that they were dangerous and not people she could even try to mess with.



She scurried off to make the coffee for them and in no time, she was already finished. When she took it to them, they seemed busy. The guy who brought out his gun had a laptop in front of him with his whole attention on it while the lady was talking to the other guy. Sophia saw the snake tattoo on the laptop guy's left wrist and she couldn't help but stare at the other's wrists. Just as expected, they had the same tattoo on their left wrists.



Were they in a cult or something?



Did her parents' killer send them to kill her?



""He's here"", The laptop guy closed his laptop and stood up before pushing his gun back to his trousers' holster and Sophia swallowed.



Who was there? Was it their boss who was going to kill her like he did with her parents?



The lady glanced at Sophia and the tray which had three steaming cups of coffee on it and gave her a small smile. ""I'm sorry, we're in a hurry. We can't take it again"", The lady placed a ten dollar note in Sophia's palm. ""Keep the change"", She smiled and the trio left from the coffee shop.



Sophia breathed out in relief and looked at the dollar note in her hand. She quickly went to drop the towel she was using the clean the tables. She was scared they would return so she made up her mind to leave the work for that night and complete it the next morning as early as possible before the coffee shop would be opened for customers.



She quickly strapped her bag across her shoulders locked the transparent doors of the coffee shop and walked down the alley towards her grandma and her house since she moved in with her grandma after her parents' death while their house was sold. She was too traumatized and scared to even live in the same house where her parents were murdered right in front of her.



""Please, I'm sorry"",



Sophia halted in her steps when she heard someone's pleading voice coming from where she was about to pass through to go home.



""You fucking gave information to the enemy and you expect us to spare your useless life?"", Another man sneered. It was as if he was the one who was being begged to spare the other person's life. ""How smart of you, Russo"",



""I'm sorry, please won't do it again. Please accept me back"", The pleading man continued.



Something about the whole noise didn't settle well with Sophia and a part of her told her to run and follow another way back home but the curious part of her was against that thoughtful side. She had forgotten the saying, 'Curiosity killed the cat'. She moved further until she could catch a glimpse of the people there.



Sophia's throat suddenly went dry when she saw the people there.



They were the trio from the coffee shop and they had an older-looking man on his knees in front of them, begging for his life while a laptop guy pointed his gun at him.



Could he be the one they said had arrived?



A sense of relief flooded through her that at least she wasn't the one they had planned to kill but still, that man's life was in danger and she wasn't sure she could help because they were dangerous people and they were saying something about him betraying them so his death was already predicted to happen.



""Young Miss-"", The poor man looked at the lady who had an emotionless look on her face, reminding Sophia of her parents' murderer. ""I know you as a nice girl, please save me. Spare my life"",



""How dare you even think of talking to our sister?"", The second guy slapped the man across the face, and that instant, Sophia fixed the puzzle.



The three were siblings and the lady was the younger one of them. Maybe the laptop guy was the older one? She wasn't sure of that.



""Mr. Russo, we can't do anything to save you as long as Don has given the order that you should be killed for your huge betrayal"" "" the lady said. She didn't even look or sound like someone who would give out money to someone like Sophia as she did back at the coffee shop.



""Even without Don's orders, this mother fucker is dying right now"", the Laptop guy growled and pressed the gun in between the man's eyes. ""Last prayer-last wish"",



""Please spare Me-I have a fa-"" The laptop guy didn't let him finish when he pulled the trigger.



""That was fast"", The other guy smiled at the laptop guy who wasn't even smiling at all.



Sophia stared with wide eyes at the lifeless body of the man on the floor as he lay there, in a pool of his blood while his eyes were opened in horror and without realizing it, a scream tore from her lips.",1,1747335166.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
1kng5cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kng5cp/should_you_choose_mixi_carryon_luggage_for_travel/,Should you choose Mixi carry-on luggage for travel find out in review,"**Sleek and Innovative Design**  
Testing the Mixi Carry On Luggage with Cup Phone Holder and Charger, I immediately noticed how stunning it looks in its rock-gray shade. The metallic-like gray finish is far more appealing in person, exuding a polished and modern vibe. A notable design feature is the top-opening lid. Unlike traditional split-in-middle suitcases, this layout makes packing and accessing belongings so much simpler. It truly feels like this piece of luggage was thoughtfully crafted to solve travel-related annoyances.

[Check mixi B0CMX8VNFN price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0cmx8vnfn/)

**Standout Features You‚Äôll Appreciate**  
One of my favorite aspects has to be the multi-functional holder system. The built-in cup and phone holders were ingenious additions! Picture balancing a hot Starbucks coffee in the airport rush‚Äîthis luggage‚Äôs holder keeps your hands free. The built-in USB and Type-C ports are also game-changers, perfect for charging without hunting for an airport outlet. A quick note: folks should remember to grab a power bank to make full use of this feature!

**Build Quality That Shines**  
The suitcase flaunts exceptional durability. Crafted from a three-layer Covestro PC material, it‚Äôs touted as highly scratch-resistant. While scuff marks can happen during turbulent trips (thanks, baggage handlers!), I‚Äôve found using a clean, damp cloth easily removes most marks. It‚Äôs surprisingly lightweight considering its sturdy build, weighing just 8.66 pounds, and still feels tough enough to weather many years of travel.

**Advantages**  
- Innovative top-opening lid for easier packing.  
- Integrated USB & Type-C ports for on-the-go charging.  
- Sleek, scratch-resistant hard shell.  

**User-Friendly Wheels and Handles**  
The spinner wheels on this carry-on roll like butter. Maneuvering through crowded spaces or navigating uneven airport floors becomes effortless. The telescopic handle glides smoothly and doesn‚Äôt wobble like those found on cheaper luggage. I attached my lightweight duffle bag to the handle, and everything remained stable, proving how sturdy it is. Bonus points for handles on both the top and side, making overhead compartment lifting manageable.

**Critical Drawbacks to Consider**  
While I love the innovations, the suitcase isn't without a few hiccups:  
- Missing a battery pack to power the charging system.  
- Stiff cup holder mechanism that occasionally feels finicky.  
- Lacks included instructions, leaving users to figure out certain features themselves.

**Capacity & Organization**  
This suitcase offers a generous 42-liter capacity, which housed my belongings for a four-day trip. The inner compartments, paired with a lightweight lid fitted with organizing sleeves, kept everything tidy. Packing cubes were especially useful here, taking advantage of the deep space. Moreover, the TSA-approved lock system gave me assurance while zipping through security checks.

**Competing Brands**  
I‚Äôve owned luggage from Samsonite and American Tourister in the past. Compared to Samsonite, this carry-on feels similarly high-end yet more creative with added perks like the cup holder and charging ports. Although American Tourister offers competitive pricing, their offerings lean more traditional and lack as many innovative features as the Mixi. On the flip side, brands like Away focus on style and charging features but at a heftier price. The Mixi strikes an impressive balance.

**Bang for the Buck**  
With its premium features and durability, this suitcase delivers immense value. Mixi proves that functional doesn‚Äôt mean boring, as the clever designs‚Äîlike those top dividers and versatile holders‚Äîtruly justify its cost. If you‚Äôre a frequent traveler or someone that values ease of use during trips, this case stands out as a smart investment.

I thought I was done with long COVID. After about a year, most of my symptoms had resolved ‚Äî no more fatigue, brain fog, or heart issues. The only lingering symptom was occasional muscle twitches, but nothing major.

Then in January of this year, I got sick again (not sure if it was COVID), and ever since then, some weird new symptoms have been creeping in. They‚Äôre not the classic long COVID fatigue-related ones. I actually have no fatigue at all ‚Äî if anything, I feel like I‚Äôm wired all the time.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:
	‚Ä¢	I feel like I‚Äôm constantly on edge ‚Äî as if I‚Äôve had 10 cups of coffee. My body is jittery, shaky, and overstimulated almost all the time.
	‚Ä¢	Just holding a static position (sitting, standing still, etc.) can set off what feels like internal tremors or buzzing.
	‚Ä¢	I can still exercise, but afterward my body feels more trembly than usual ‚Äî like it‚Äôs overreacting.
	‚Ä¢	Even something simple like bicep curls can trigger a full-body response that feels like intense anxiety or adrenaline surging ‚Äî almost like the physical reaction you‚Äôd have if someone were breaking into your house. It‚Äôs that intense.
	‚Ä¢	Sometimes I get dizzy or feel slightly off balance.
	‚Ä¢	My muscles don‚Äôt feel stiff, but they often tense up randomly, like they‚Äôre clenching in anticipation of something bad happening.
	‚Ä¢	I still have muscle twitches throughout the day.

It‚Äôs not panic attacks ‚Äî I‚Äôm not mentally anxious most of the time. It‚Äôs just a constant physical feeling of being in fight-or-flight, and it seems to get worse with exertion or even simple static postures.

Me and my friend Isaac are looking for a third rooommate to team up with to find a 3 bed apartment. We have a budget of  $1600 per person (flexible) and interested in neighborhoods such as park slope, prospect heights, cobble hill, bed stuy, bushwick, and Williamsburg. Pretty open to other areas of Brooklyn and manhattan too as long as it fits the budget. We both work mostly remote so we‚Äôre flexible. We‚Äôre looking for someone with similar preferences.

About me:
I'm a Canadian in my late 20s working in the architecture field as a landscape architect. I recently moved to NYC a year ago from Toronto for a new job. I currently live in the upper east side. I will be working from home most of the time, but would probably try and find a coffee shop nearby to work at as I hate sitting in my room all day.

My interests include video/board games, architecture and design, live music, watching sports (mainly hockey), urban exploring, hanging out at parks/coffee shops, travelling

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

About Isaac:
I‚Äôm 25 years old with a fully remote job! Will be working from home very often. I‚Äôm from the Midwest (near Chicago) and moved to NY area one year ago. 

I usually keep in my room with my pc. I am clean but not a neat freak. Interests include video games, coffee shops, soccer, football (go bears), and traveling 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

We appreciate someone clean, respectful, open-minded, fun, communicative, and social roommates! We like going out every now and then so it‚Äôd be cool if you can join!

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding.

- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.

This confirms my theory that it‚Äôs 207 mm. Doing the math, it can fit around 20 cups of coffee, meaning they both had 10 cups. 

With an average cup having around 120 mg of caffeine they both had 1.2 grams of caffeine in the morning. The FDA suggests you take 400 mg per day at most, so this already is bad.

There is no clock I can see, but let‚Äôs assume he woke up at 7, since it‚Äôs still morning, and went out of the house at 8:30. That means they both had 1200 mg of caffeine in 90 minutes. This is very bad and could have killed them.",13,1747334008.0,okbuddymotherfucker,6,0.93,False

January 2017 (Two years prior)

‚ÄúMother, no! Please don‚Äôt die, please!‚Äù The shrieking voice of a teenager echoed throughout the hospital. Only the patients near the room could hear how miserable and dismal the young girl was.

‚ÄúAnna, call your father,‚Äù the dying woman lying lifeless on the bed slowly opened her eyes and muttered in a low voice.

‚ÄúMother, I‚Äôve already called him on the doctor‚Äôs phone. He‚Äôs on his way,‚Äù Anna replied hurriedly, holding her mother's hand.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame you, Anna. I decided to come and save you. Don‚Äôt blame yourself,‚Äù the woman said softly, then closed her eyes for the last time.

The sound of the heart monitor flatlining brought Anna back to reality. She was trembling all over. Her mother was gone.

‚ÄúAnnabella! Annabella!‚Äù An older man shouted as he entered the room, looking into the lifeless eyes of his beloved wife.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dead, and it‚Äôs all that bitch‚Äôs fault!‚Äù he cried out.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call me earlier?! She came to save you from being raped, but you just stood there while she was beaten to death! Why were you even out in the first place?‚Äù Mr. Walton yelled at his eldest daughter while her younger sister sobbed quietly in the corner of the hospital room.

‚ÄúDaddy‚Ä¶‚Äù Anna whispered, looking up at her father with tear-filled eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me that, you despicable little bitch!‚Äù Mr. Walton screamed before slapping Anna across the face.

From that day on, Mr. Walton swore to make Anna‚Äôs life a living hell, blaming her for the death of his beloved wife.

Present Day (December 2019)

Anna was about to light up the cigarette she had stolen from her father, having finished the daily chores he demanded she complete, or else face another round of beatings and starvation. Just as she lifted the lighter, her father‚Äôs angry voice bellowed from the house.

‚ÄúAnna! Anna! Where‚Äôs that little bitch?‚Äù Mr. Walton shouted as he began throwing things around the house, clearly enraged that things weren‚Äôt going his way.

Upon hearing her father‚Äôs voice, Anna knew trouble was coming. She quickly shoved the cigarette back into its pack and returned it to the spot her father usually kept it. Then, she shouted back, ‚ÄúFather, I‚Äôm here!‚Äù She repeated herself, knowing he hated being ignored.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been calling you for ten minutes! Do I look like a joke to you?‚Äù Mr. Walton demanded as he stormed over, yanking Anna by the hair and slapping her hard across the face, causing her to flinch and fall to the floor in pain.

‚ÄúI asked you, do I look like a joke to you?‚Äù he shouted, raining more slaps and kicks on Anna‚Äôs already bruised body. But she remained silent, knowing that speaking up would only prolong the abuse.

After what felt like an eternity of being slapped and kicked, Mr. Walton finally stopped to catch his breath, kicking a nearby chair in frustration. Anna remained on the floor, clutching her red, swollen cheeks as tears streamed down her face. She quickly wiped them away, knowing that if her father saw her crying, it would only encourage him to continue.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Maria? Is she in her room?‚Äù Mr. Walton asked, slightly calmer now.

‚ÄúShe... she‚Äôs not back from school yet,‚Äù Anna stuttered, barely able to speak through the pain.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. The abuse had started two years ago, right after her mother‚Äôs funeral. Her once-loving father had become bitter, blaming her for her mother‚Äôs death, even though it wasn‚Äôt her fault. He needed someone to blame, and unfortunately, Anna was the only one there to take the brunt of his grief and rage.

‚ÄúSince Maria‚Äôs not here, listen closely,‚Äù Mr. Walton sneered, ‚ÄúI owe someone a lot of money, and I‚Äôll never be able to pay him back. He needs a wife, someone to stay in his house while he‚Äôs away on business trips and bear his children. You‚Äôre just dead weight around here. Look at you, big and well-fed, while my precious daughter Maria is thinner than you.‚Äù

Anna bit her lip, holding back a sarcastic remark. ‚ÄúPrecious daughter,‚Äù she thought. Maria was always the favorite, while she was nothing more than an unwanted burden.

‚ÄúThe man will be here in a few minutes to pick you up. I‚Äôve already signed the papers. Be a good wife to him, or else don‚Äôt bother coming back here. If you do, I‚Äôll make sure your face isn‚Äôt as smooth as it is now,‚Äù Mr. Walton threatened.

Anna sat on the floor, head bowed, listening to her father‚Äôs tirade. She didn‚Äôt dare move until he gave her permission, fearing more beatings.

‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for? Get up! Go pack your things before he gets here!‚Äù Mr. Walton shouted, his patience running thin.

Anna scrambled to her room, her mind racing. She was finally leaving this hell. Even if it meant becoming a stranger‚Äôs wife, anything was better than staying here with her abusive father.

As she packed her few belongings, she quickly wrote a letter to her younger sister, Maria:

Dear Maria,

I‚Äôve left to become the wife of a man I‚Äôve never met because that‚Äôs what our father wants. Don‚Äôt look for me or be sad. I‚Äôm glad to be leaving. Take care of yourself.

Your loving sister,

Anna

She carefully hid the letter under the candle lamp, knowing that if her father found it, she wouldn‚Äôt even be safe in her new husband‚Äôs house.

As she finished packing, the sound of a car horn echoed from outside. Her father‚Äôs voice bellowed once again from downstairs.

‚ÄúAnna! Get down here, he‚Äôs waiting!‚Äù

Car honks immediately brought her out of her daydream and she quickly hurried to where she was hearing the honks from to meet her soon-to-be husband.

# The contract marriage

Immediately after she got to the car, Anna received one of the biggest shocks of her life.

He was an old man!!

The man who she would be spending the rest of her life with and also carry his children as her father had ordered was an old man.

He looked so old that Anna was sure that he must be over 40.

Cruel, so cruel!

Her father was so cruel to her.

She should have known that her soon-to-be husband wouldn't have any good attributes because her father would never allow her to be happy or be with someone that can make her happy.

What was she expecting? A young, rich and handsome man? Pfft.

She should consider herself lucky that her soon-to-be husband was just old and not cripple or downright ugly. Because looking at him now, she could still see traces of someone who had been handsome on his face.

‚ÄúIf you are done scrutinizing me, I‚Äôd suggest you enter the car because I don't have much time at hand. Today is the only day I have to go to the registrar.‚Äù The old man countered when he saw that the young girl who shouldn't be more than 18/ 19 was still staring at him.

Her father had shown him a picture of her earlier, telling him that she was his daughter, and she's ripe enough for him to marry, and in place of the debt he owed he will give his daughter to him in marriage.

He wouldn't have accepted if not because he knew that he had to start making kids, for he was a divorcee and his ex-wife didn't give birth to any children before she divorced him.

Upon hearing the urgency in his voice, Anna quickly entered the opened passenger seat because she feared irritating her soon-to-be husband. If she can avoid physical pain from him, she would do that because she would rather not be abused and maltreated by the man she would be spending the rest of her life with.

‚ÄúYour name is Anna, right?‚Äù The man asked immediately, Anna was firmly seated beside him as he drove off.

‚ÄúYes, my name is Anna, sir.‚Äù Anna replied in a trembling voice as she held her pack in her shaky hands.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me sir, Call me Peter. I'm Peter Danish, you will soon be Mrs. Danish, so you should get used to the name,‚Äù Peter said gently as he saw that Anna was trembling and wasn't comfortable around him.

He doesn't care for any state of mind she might be, all he wanted is an obedient girl that would voluntarily stay in his mansion and give birth to his kids while he went for his business trips to make money.

‚ÄúOh. Oh, kay Peter‚Ä¶, ‚Äù. Anna replied again, still trembling, and shaky.

Even though she was receiving a manipulative aura from him, she was still scared of him.

He was someone that her abusive father knew and sold her to, he wouldn't be of a good character. She was definitely sure of that.

‚ÄúWe are going to the registrar now, and I wouldn't want you looking scared and forced, so stop shaking and put the goddam pack you are holding on to in the back seat,‚Äù Peter let out when he saw that his soon-to-be wife looked like a puppy who was whipped and knocked out.

Anna hurriedly fulfilled his command and reminded herself to stop shaking else the man, no Peter‚Ä¶might hit her as her father does.

‚ÄúPut a smile on your face too, you look forced. Do you want me to send you back to your father?‚Äù Peter asked, he didn't want an unwilling wife. If she was forced into this, he would gladly take her back to her father and demand all the cents he owed him.

Immediately Anna heard that Peter said he would take her back to her father, she flinched and quickly forced a smile on her face as she remembered her father‚Äôs last comment that she mustn't come back to the house.

She can't, she definitely cannot let him send her back to her father.

She must act willingly. In fact, she's willing to be anything he wants, a maid, slave, property anything as long as she doesn‚Äôt have to go back into the hellhole she just crawled out from.

When Peter saw the tiny smile on Anna‚Äôs face, he nodded, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better, keep the smile on every time. You will be needing it when you get married to me,‚Äù Peter advised as he pulled into the court registry car pack and died down his engine.

Immediately Peter alighted the car, Anna quickly helped herself down, covering the visible belt marks on her neck with the shawl that she remembered to bring with her.

Walking slowly behind her soon-to-be husband, Anna prepared herself for the life she didn't know how it would turn out.

It's better to prepare for the worst. She had to adapt to it no matter how hard or dangerous it was, she had to accept it as her fate.

‚ÄúDo you, Anna Walton, Take Peter Danish as your lawfully wedded husband, in health, wealth, and till death do you apart?‚Äù The registrar asked after Peter submitted the papers signed by her father.

Slowly brought out of her daydreams, Anna whispered her agreement and instantly sealed her fate with a single word, ‚ÄúYes, I do‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you Peter Danish, Take Anna Walton as your lawfully wedded wife, in health, wealth and till death do you apart?‚Äù the registrar repeated the wedding vows again to Peter, and he immediately replied, ‚ÄúYes, I do‚Äù

After the signing the necessary documents and exchanging rings, Anna left the court registry with her new husband to the new home she would be staying with him.

The initial smile she had forced herself to put on while they were in the court immediately left her face when she was alone in a big mansion with her new husband.

‚ÄúCan you cook? If yes, make use of the kitchen, I'm hungry as fuck,‚Äù Peter mumbled, as he looked off the outer suit and unbuttoned his shirt.

‚ÄúYes, I can,‚Äù Anna muttered in a low voice.

Cooking? Is that it? If he would only demand her to cook for him. Then her life just got easier because she had learned different type of cuisine when she was working as a housemaid in her father's house.

Cooking is just a hobby she had grown into apart from painting.

Anna immediately located the kitchen, when she got there, she saw that there wasn't even much to do with. The cooking ingredients in the kitchen were just eggs, bread, vegetables oil, carbonated milk, coffee beans and so on‚Ä¶

Anna quickly got to work and made sandwiches and some tea for her husband because that was the fastest food she could make with what she had at hand.

Serving the food on the table in a corner, which she regarded as the dining room, Anna stood beside the food gently because her husband hadn't appeared yet, and she didn't know the room he went into.

After a few minutes, Peter showed himself in the room, ‚ÄúAre you done cooking?‚Äù he called out,

‚ÄúYes, I'm done,‚Äù Anna replied, quickly when her husband came into the sitting room.

When Peter got to the dining room and saw that Anna only prepared a plate of sandwich, he frowned, ‚ÄúWhy did you prepare only a plate? Are you not hungry?‚Äù

Anna, who was already used to eating alone in her room, suddenly trembled when she heard the annoyance in his voice.

‚ÄúI-

‚ÄúGo and prepare yours too, I hate eating alone,‚Äù Peter interrupted dismissively before Anna could finish her sentence.

Anna hurriedly left for the kitchen again and came out with another plate of sandwich for herself and sat slowly in the opposite chair in front of her new husband.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat,‚Äù Peter announced when he saw that his wife was not seated.

Anna quickly held her spoon and started eating after her husband‚Äôs announcement.

He said he hates eating alone, she had to take note of that and never repeat the error she just made because she feared what he might do to her when he was angry.

Would he be like her father who hits and kick her?

Anna shuddered at the thought, and Peter could see her visibly trembling.

Is he thinking about what he would be doing to her in their matrimony room?

Peter stared at Anna through the corners of his eyes and saw that she was still trembling.

Is she that scared of sex?

Well, no worries he wasn't in the mood for sex this night because he had to leave for a business trip tomorrow and he wanted to take off as soon as possible.

But that doesn't mean she won't satisfy him sexually. No matter how scared she was, she still had to open her gorgeous mouth and suck on his huge load with her sweet lips.

Peter couldn't help but groan when he remembered how sweet and soft her lips were from the quick kiss they shared at the court registry.

He can't wait to have that mouth wrapped around his member and stroke him till he shoots his fluids deep down her throats.

Peter cleared his throat quickly when he saw that he was already getting hard at the thought, ‚ÄúAre you a virgin or not?‚Äù

# She‚Äôs a virgin

Anna blinked her eyes immediately after she heard her husband‚Äôs voice,

Virgin?

Of course, she was still a virgin.

She was just an eighteen years old high school dropout, and she barely left the house.

So, where would she wanted to see a man that would shove his dick down her vagina?

The only sexual experience she had was when she rubbed herself inside her room, and fantasized about the men she read about in the books. Her sister always did the pleasure of helping her get them bookstores with the pocket money given to her by their father.

Apart from that, she was as innocent as Virgin Mary.

She hasn't even kissed or touch again a man before until today at the court registry.

‚ÄúYes Peter, I'm a virgin,‚Äù Anna slowly answered, as she looked down at her food and ate the last bit of the sandwich.

Upon hearing her confirmed that she was really a virgin, Peter felt an unexpected feeling of lust ran down his hair down to his crotch, he couldn't stop himself from imagining touching and exploring his new innocent wife.

Even though he won‚Äôt have his ways with her now, he was going to make sure that he knew what her pussy warmth felt like with his index and middle fingers.

‚ÄúYou know what happens every marriage night, right?‚Äù Peter asked his little wife as he gently dab a serviette gently on the corner of her mouth and slowly licked his lips.

That mouth.

Upon hearing her husband question, Anna instantly shivered, ‚ÄúYe‚Ä¶ Yes,‚Äù She managed to let out, when she realized what he meant.

They were going to have sex

Her virginity which she had promised herself to give to the man who would cherish and love her would be snatched by the man she was sold to by her father.

Anna felt her eyes prickled with tears, but she immediately sniffed it back and acted as if there was nothing wrong.

Well, it wasn't that she wasn't expecting this because if she said that she wasn't expecting to have sex with the old man, she will be lying to herself.

Since her father said, her only usefulness to Peter was to give him children as if she were just a breeding machine.

Since it's merely sex, she will do it.

‚ÄúWell, if you are done eating, go upstairs and freshen up. The master's room is on the left. Just take your bath and wait for me on the bed, ‚ÄùPeter said as he indicated to the steps in front of them.

Anna instantly stood up and made her way upstairs.

It won't hurt, I only have to calm down. It's better than getting beaten and treated like a slave.

At Least now, she can eat and sleep anytime she wants.

And it wasn't as if the sex were going to last all night. She will endure it. Anna reminded herself under the shower after entering the master room.

‚ÄòShe's finally going to have sex‚Äô Anna thought. Even though it's not how she had wanted, she's finally going to experience sexual intercourse with another human.

Regardless of how old he was, Anna was still excited because he was her husband and she better start getting adapted to the sex, else she might never have a good sexual experience all her life.

It was after a few minutes when Anna took her bath and lay gently on the bed after wearing the red nightgown she saw on the bed earlier when Peter entered the master room.

He raised his head to see Anna's womanly figure on the bed, waiting for him, and he instantly got hard at the thought.

‚ÄúDo you put on the nightgown,‚Äú Peter asked with a deep voice, filled with lust and expectation.

Seeing that her husband was finally inside, Anna quickly turned and sat on the bed. ‚ÄúYes, I did, ‚Äùshe replied to her husband‚Äôs question.

She had presumed the nightgown was for her because it was new, and it was right on the bed, so she had worn it after she took her bath.

She quickly thanked her stars for following her instincts because she didn't know if he would have gotten angry and beat her.

She didn't want to be beaten again.

Peter was about to switch on the light to see her almost naked body because he knew what the nightgown is made of, it barely covers anything. Since she was wearing it, he knew that her breasts would almost be spilling out because the nightgown wasn't her right size, for he could see that she had an enormous breast.

‚ÄúNo, please leave the light off, ‚ÄùAnna said slowly when she saw her husband‚Äôs action.

No! The light mustn't be on!

If not, he's going to see the scars in her body, and he might not find her attractive anymore.

What if he's going to send her back to her father!

She can't go back!

She definitely can't go back to that house.

Peter, who thought she was shy because she was still a virgin, decided to leave the light on and moved closer to her on the bed.

When Anna saw her husband approaching, her heart tightened and as if it were pulled by a string.

‚ÄòWould he be hard on her?‚Äô Anna thought as she trembled

Peter smiled gently as he slowly unfastened the button of the red nightgown his little wife was putting and as he heard her breathed a sharp breath.

Seeing her nervous and trembling, Peter found out that it made him even more excited and harder. Gently raising his hands to scoop her enormous breast, Peter found out that they are as soft as they looked. He rubbed his thumb slowly over one of her nipples and took the other in his waiting mouth as Anna sharply took another hot breath.

‚ÄúWhen I learned that you are a virgin, I almost couldn't resist taking you right there in the dining room. But because I want to know how you'd look in this nightgown I restrained myself and let you prepare yourself, tell me how are you feeling,‚Äú Peter said to Anna but she only frowned.

This wasn't what she had prepared herself for.

She had thought that even if she was attracted to the old man, she would at least enjoy the sex, but when he grabbed her breasts just now, she felt like a frog was crawling on her body.

She has never felt disgusted! She would rather pleasure herself all her life if this is what it will always feel like.

‚ÄúI said how are you feeling? Why are you mute? Don‚Äôt you like how I‚Äôm touching you?‚Äù Peter asked suddenly as he halted his actions, ‚Äúdo you feel disgusted because I‚Äôm not young? Do you want a young man instead? Talk!‚Äù Peter sneered, but Anna was too scared to utter a word as tears gathered in her eyes.

He was going to hit her!

Or worse, he would send her back to her father! She had to cooperate, no matter what. She had to take it.

‚ÄúI feel good, I feel good,‚Äù Anna quickly lied as she held her disgust to herself while trembling visibly.

‚ÄúHphmn! There‚Äôs no rush. You will always be here when I come back from my business trips. You will learn to have my old dick inside you whether you are accustomed to it or not.‚Äù Peter declared, suddenly losing interest in touching her.

But he doesn‚Äôt want to touch her, which doesn't mean that he wouldn‚Äôt still shove his dick down her sweet mouth and have her wrap her warm mouth around him.

At that thought, Peter instantly discarded his shorts alongside his boxes, and Anna couldn't help but gasp at how big he was.

He should be roughly 6 inches, Anna thought as she accessed the dark frame of her new husband‚Äôs member.

Guessed age doesn't reduce the size of manhood, because she was expecting him to be around 4 or 5 inches.

Is he going to have s@x with her now? Anna‚Äôs heart skipped at the thought of having someone she couldn't even withstand his touch to be inside her. But she was surprised when her husband grabbed her right hand and wrapped it around his manhood, ‚ÄúStroke me, at least you can do that, right?‚Äù Peter mumbled when he felt the softness of Anna‚Äôs hand on his dick.

Fuck! He was instantly excited and hard.

Anna looked at him, innocently, ‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt know how,‚Äù she whispered in a slow and trembling voice.

Shocked and amazed by her innocence, Peter groaned harshly in pleasure, ‚Äúyou don't know how? You don't know how to give a hand job?‚Äù Peter asked as he looked at his new wife in the dark and saw that she was shaking her head as she trembled slightly.

‚ÄúFind, then use your mouth then, wrap your mouth on it as you held it in your hands and suck on it,‚Äù Peter commanded,",1,1747333998.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1knfmh6,https://i.redd.it/7jsga45moz0f1.jpeg,Between the Four Alphas by  K. K. Winter. Free novel ready to read! Comment now and I‚Äôll send you the complete link.,"# I did my duty and fu*ked you, didn't I?

‚ÄúHey. Listen, my buddies over there, bet me,‚Äù the guy who approached Seth at the bar pointed his finger to the furthest booth behind them. ‚ÄúThat I couldn‚Äôt get the number of the hottest girl here, but I beg to differ. How about I buy you some drinks with their money?‚Äù

Seth knew from the moment he approached her that the man had to be an Alpha. He was wearing the typical arrogant smile all of them did. But she also was sure that there was no way he couldn‚Äôt sleep or chat with any girl in his way, so the ice-breaker he used had to be a trap.

This was a bar for all kinds of shifters, not only wolves. Slowly, Seth turned in her seat to look at the booth he referred to. She instantly noticed a group of panthers sitting there, laughing at jokes one of them spat out. The moment they noticed Seth‚Äôs eyes on them, all men raised their glasses in greeting.

‚ÄúWell, free drinks do sound lovely,‚Äù Seth turned back to the stranger and let her gaze travel over him. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶‚Äù she dragged as she raised from her seat and leaned closer to whisper, ‚Äúyou are far from my type. I‚Äôll pass.‚Äù

As soon as the words escaped her, Seth spun on her heel and left him at the bar. As she walked through the crowds, she wasn‚Äôt surprised to see all the present species sitting at different tables and booths.

Panthers sat several feet away from lions. Hyenas mixed up with others, as per usual, forming a large crowd to hide in.

Seth noticed an empty table and sat down, hoping she could get some time to enjoy the drinks alone. But as always, as her luck would have it, someone sat right next to her and waved at the bartender to bring them drinks.

The visibly drunk man who sat next to her was a wolf. A Beta. He was surprisingly big for a regular Beta, if Seth didn‚Äôt know better, she could have mistaken him for an Alpha.

As much as Seth enjoyed life in the new town, there was one thing she didn‚Äôt like - wolves. The wolf shifters ruled this town, hence they were everywhere.

Seth was a puma. Her species were almost extinct, and all of them were spectacular at hiding their scents. Most of the present shifters probably assumed that she was just another human.

Her eyes focused on the drunk wolf, who was quickly chosen as her catch of the night.

Seth was a woman, driven by pleasure and desire. She didn‚Äôt fall in love. Just fucked. On top of that, while Alphas were the most she-shifter dreams, it was the complete opposite for Seth.

Alphas were a big no. She would never allow a man to dominate her.

‚ÄúSo? What do you think?‚Äù The drunk wolf, whatever his name was, placed a hand over her shoulder, slowly sliding down from her shoulder. Within seconds, the large palm cupped her upper thigh.

‚ÄúSorry, I got a little distracted by the people around us.‚Äù She cooed, faking a surprise, ‚Äúa drink at your place? Yeah, getting away from all of these people would be nice. Why not, the offer sounds very tempting.‚Äù

The corner of her lip twitched, making the man assume that she enjoyed his touch.

‚ÄúShall we leave now? My apartment‚Äôs just around the corner.‚Äù He flashed a million-dollar worth smile and winked at her, possibly thinking it made him look seductive.

*‚ÄúBingo.‚Äù*¬†Seth mentally praised herself for the quick catch and nodded her head, acting as innocent as possible. Even though his way too wide smile was a major turn off, she didn‚Äôt care.

She had wasted way too much time talking to the arrogant Alpha and now the Beta too. Unfortunately, Seth knew she wouldn‚Äôt do any better even if she tried to hunt for longer.

After they left, Seth found out that the Beta didn‚Äôt lie about how close his apartment was. As soon as she stepped inside of it - their clothes flew everywhere. The sound of fabric tearing didn‚Äôt bother her. She was there for a dose of pleasure and ecstasy, nothing could stop her.

‚ÄúIf I had known that you‚Äôre this hot under those clothes, I‚Äôd throw you over my shoulder and bring you here before wasting time on those drinks.‚Äù The nameless man groaned, struggling to undo his belt.

Her eyes focused on his shaking hands, a wave of extreme annoyance instantly washed over her. The more he tried to rush things, the more times he failed at undressing himself.

Seth couldn‚Äôt stand watching his miserable attempt to seem manly, so she rolled her eyes, groaned, and slapped his hands away, undoing his belt in seconds.

‚ÄúA little eager, ain‚Äôt you?‚Äù He chuckled. Of course, the wolf thought he was the center of the universe.

‚ÄúI'm not going down on you if that‚Äôs what you think. Don‚Äôt even dream about it. Now, where are the condoms? Less talking, more fucking.‚Äù Seth hissed, unable to hold herself back.

She had a hard time pretending to be the little, innocent girl, and if he didn‚Äôt give her what she came for, there was no reason to stick around.

‚ÄúOn the nightstand in my bedroom.‚Äù The Beta announced, sucking on her neck like a bloodsucker. If anything, this was the worst way to turn on a woman who was ready to have a one night stand.

‚ÄúSo? Lead the way. I‚Äôm not here for hours of foreplay.‚Äù She had to gather all of her willpower to avoid pushing him away from her. If she did - he would understand that the woman he brought home wasn‚Äôt a human. Giving out her identity would be the biggest mistake she could make.

‚ÄúYour wish is my command,‚Äù he whispered in her ear, trying his best to sound sexy and aggressive, yet in her mind, those words sounded somewhat submissive.

Another red flag, but after getting this far, it was too late to turn around and leave.

‚ÄúUm, where. I mean, how? No, forget that. Anyway, is there a position you prefer or surface? Like a desk or bed?‚Äù The Beta held the little package in one hand and scratched the back of his neck with the other.

‚ÄúYou know what, just give me the damn condom and lay back; I might, as well, do everything myself. Not that I haven‚Äôt done it before.‚Äù Mentally, Seth cursed the whole planet, all Gods known to humankind, and most importantly - herself.

He did as told and laid back on the bed, placing both of his hands behind his head. The flushed, confused facial expression was replaced by a slight grin way too quickly. And that was yet another thing that annoyed Seth.

The satisfaction in his eyes was irritating. She rolled the condom down his cock and decided to punish the guy for his arrogance.

Seth dropped her panties right next to his bed and crawled on top of him, positioned the tip of his cock right at her entrance and sunk down.

She didn‚Äôt wait till the moment when her walls would stretch, taking his full length within a second. He wasn‚Äôt as big as some of her previous toys, so there wasn‚Äôt anything she had to get used to.

Seth placed her hands on his chest and started to move her hips, riding him at a torturously slow pace. His hands, not surprisingly, didn‚Äôt leave the back of his head, disappointing Seth even more.

‚ÄúYou could grab my tits or spank my ass once or twice, you know.‚Äù She hissed out, fastening her movements, putting a little more strength in them.

Watching his face like a hawk, she patiently waited for any reply until Seth had enough of his silence, and she stopped her movements.

‚ÄúWhat? Why did you stop? I was enjoying that?‚Äù He tried to protest, a deep frown taking over his facial features.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt fuck you for your pleasure; I‚Äôm doing this for myself.‚Äù

All he had to do was grab her by her hips, hold her still, and fuck the living soul out of her. Was it too much to ask for? Couldn‚Äôt he do one thing?

Annoyed, Seth still rode him until she hit the climax, moaning out in ecstasy. Her right hand slid down to her pussy, cupping and squeezing it gently. She hissed a couple of times, biting onto her lip as her movements became slower and slower until she stopped.

Seth looked down at the surprised man, winked at him, and rolled off him, turning her back to the stunned Beta. ‚ÄúThat's it? I was so close. Why did you‚Ä¶‚Äù he tried to protest, well aware of the fact that he had no right to do so.

‚ÄúI did my part and fucked you, didn‚Äôt I? Now zip it; I‚Äôm tired.‚Äù Seth hissed.

To her delight, he kept his mouth closed as she laid down and closed her eyes. Just as she was dozing off, somewhere in the room, her phone started buzzing with an incoming call.

‚ÄúWho the hell?‚Äù She groaned as she tried to reach the annoying device.

# I got you a job. $50K per night

‚ÄúHoly shit, I‚Äôve been trying to reach you for hours! Where the fuck are you?‚Äù Anton all but shouted in her ear. Seth wasn‚Äôt sure what got to her more - the annoyance or the worry in his voice.

Both of them loved spending wild nights out, but one always stood behind, waiting for the red hour. For them, the red hour was the moment when one had to leave the place.

Seth snuck out of the bedroom and slid into the bathroom. ‚ÄúI had too much wine; stop acting like my mother. I‚Äôm in his bathroom, hiding, trying to figure out how the hell I‚Äôm going to leave.‚Äù She pressed her back against the bathroom door and slid down, sighing in defeat.

‚ÄúYou're driving me crazy. Send me your location; I'm heading for the car.‚Äù He grumbled and ended the call before Seth could utter another word.

She definitely didn‚Äôt need to be told the same thing twice, so Seth shared a live location with Anton and grabbed everything that looked like it might be hers. Seth considered leaving the shirt behind, but grabbed it on her way out of the room.

Seth bolted down the stairs faster than a bullet, silently hoping that Anton had already arrived. When Seth finally ran out of the apartment building, her eyes instantly scanned the street, looking for the black Mustang. Instead, her eyes fell on the blood-red Camaro, making her curse out loud. ‚ÄúThat sneaky, little asshole, driving around the town in my goddamn car!‚Äù

As she jumped in the passenger seat, Seth glared at her best friend. His cheeks were slightly flushed and a sly smile was plastered on his lips, which could only mean one thing - he got his hands on someone‚Äôs phone number.

‚ÄúSo? Is this one handsome or cute?‚Äù Seth asked as she struggled to pull on the seatbelt.

‚ÄúHella cute. Holy shit, so cute, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that face. Another damn wolf, of course, but who cares, right? Anyway, what about the candy you enjoyed tonight?‚Äù Anton was quick to shake the topic off his case and focus on her adventures.

‚ÄúWolf. Just a Beta wolf. Not surprising since those dogs run the town. Nothing big to share.‚Äù Seth laughed once Anton understood what she was implying to.

The drive home was quiet and soon, they entered their shared apartment.

‚ÄúWell, I have some exciting news to share with you,‚Äù Anton sang as he opened the door for Seth. ‚ÄúI found you a job, since I have to leave and all. It‚Äôs nothing fancy but they are offering an insane amount of money.‚Äù A grin spread across his lips.

The money part was what made Seth excited, but that grin was screaming trouble. There had to be a catch somewhere. ‚ÄúBut?‚Äù

Seth collapsed on the couch and let out a sigh. She felt more comfortable than before.

Seth‚Äôs eyes followed Anton as he headed to the kitchen. Their apartment was an open space concept so she could easily see him pour two glasses of wine. Then, he brought them to the living room, took a seat next to Seth and handed her one of the glasses. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard about the annual Alpha games.‚Äù Ah, there it was, the damn catch.

‚ÄúWho hasn‚Äôt? Not sure why they keep on calling the games annual since they rarely happen. Honestly, I don‚Äôt understand the purpose behind those games. And to be fair, who, in their right mind, would consider broken joints, dead bodies and aggressive Alphas killing each other a freaking game? They all belong in a looney bin.‚Äù

The Alpha games were something like the Olympics for shifters. In reality, it was nothing about comparing one‚Äôs abilities over the other‚Äôs. No, it was so much worse. All in all, it was an event of slaughter, drinking, and fucking for two weeks. A lot of she-shifters paid a painfully large amount of money to end up among the guests.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not important. We didn‚Äôt invent the game, our ancestors did,‚Äù Anton waved her off as if nothing Seth just said was of importance. ‚ÄúAnyway, this year the games are happening near the capital city. The Council hasn‚Äôt bothered to announce the official location yet, but it can‚Äôt be more than eight hours drive from here.‚Äù

Anton appeared too happy. Suspiciously happy. ‚ÄúThis year, the most powerful Alphas from all across the globe will attend the games. I mean hundreds of Alphas, if not thousands.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù He invoked Seth‚Äôs curiosity.

‚ÄúThe King, he‚Äôs dying. They need a replacement for the throne, and soon. Some Alphas can have strong pups, yet some turn out to be weaklings. So, the King needs to choose the best of the best as his successor.‚Äù Anton took a sip of his wine and placed his glass on the coffee table. ‚ÄúAs far as I know, there will be at least five hundred Alphas joining this year. The winner of the games will take the throne and become the next King.‚Äù

But before Seth got a chance to question him, Anton spoke again. ‚ÄúHalf of those Alphas are unmated. Those will be held in separate buildings, away from female guests. The other half will enjoy the parties with paying guests.‚Äù

Seth raised an eyebrow, wondering if he had more details to share with her.

‚ÄúSeth, you have no idea how much the Council is willing to pay the servers. If you agree to work for them, the old farts will hand you black card by the end of each day. Interested?‚Äù Anton rubbed his palms together as excitement oozed from him.

Seth took a moment to observe her best friend. She couldn‚Äôt recall the last time she saw him this excited, this happy about something.

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs say I theoretically like how this offer sounds‚Ä¶ Tell me how much they are offering. You know me, Anton, I would sweep the streets for money. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I have to do for as long as I can earn my keep with my own hands. But this offer, despite how alluring it is, kind of freaks me out.‚Äù

Both of them remained silent until Seth decided to add a little more. ‚ÄúThose are Alphas, and not only a few, but hundreds of them. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd ever feel safe surrounded by so many assholes at the same time. It‚Äôs hard to walk in a straight line when one is around, let alone masses.‚Äù

There was a chance that Seth could get over her fear if the money was good. She could work for a while and then just sit back for months. The Council members were wealthier than the King himself; those old farts could manage to pay their servants more than many CEOs earned with their hard work.

‚ÄúDrum roll, please,‚Äù Anton raised an eyebrow at his friend, who just casually rolled her eyes. He didn‚Äôt have any other choice but to fake the drum roll himself. ‚ÄúThis year, the elders are offering fifty fucking grand per evening service. Isn‚Äôt that ridiculous?‚Äù Anton laughed, still amazed about how much one would get paid for running after Alphas.

Of course, he knew that most of those men had a bad temper; therefore, he ensured that his friend would hold a server spot for Seth. All she would have to do was bring them refreshments and snacks. How hard could that be?

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù Seth gasped, wide-eyed. She couldn‚Äôt believe her ears. Who could be dumb enough to offer such money per evening?

‚ÄúI'm not joking,‚Äù Anton spoke in a serious tone.

‚ÄúOkay, then what's the catch?‚Äù She raised an eyebrow skeptically.

‚ÄúHonestly, I forgot. I don‚Äôt think it was anything important, don‚Äôt stress about it. So? Are you in?‚Äù Anton nearly pleaded with her with his eyes to go for the offer.

Seth sat quietly for a couple of minutes, wondering if taking the risk would be worth it. ‚ÄúFuck it, all I have to do is give them drinks and food. I don‚Äôt need to interact with them and it‚Äôs not like I could meet someone I know anyway, right? So, I‚Äôm in. Not that anything could go wrong, right?‚Äù",1,1747333875.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

\*\*Luna is soon going to celebrate her 18th birthday. Male lead and her has 7 years of age gap. Both thire fathers are not related. She grow up in his family and they love her like thire daughter.

I dangled my legs in excitement as I was sitting on the bench in the garden of my all girl's Catholic schools hostel with a big smile on my face. I stared at the garden which was filled with so many different kinds of roses. Closing my eyes I took a deep breath in the alluring scent of roses as the morning sun beamed on me making me feel the warmness of summer. I love roses. I come to this garden whenever I am sad or happy because looking at roses gives me calmness whereas summer.

They gave me peace because I get to see him only this time of year. Today I was happy as this day had finally arrived. I have been waiting for five years for this day and I can't express my emotions anymore. I don't know how to express it. On one hand, I feel all the excitement and on the other hand, I feel a sweet fear slowly spreading in my limbs somehow making them feel the rush of my emotions. I pulled the straps of my bag full of my clothes back on my shoulder which had fallen from my shoulder as I was lost in my dream world with a big smile on my face. In the past five years, I have planned so many things a fifteen-year-old could think of. My thoughts were interpreted as I heard a shilling voice calling me.

""Luna---Luna"" I heard my name being called continuously. I turned my head to find my best friend Ella who was running towards me as if a ghost of the old building was behind her. She slowed her pace only when she was only a few steps away from me so she could stop herself from falling on me with a force. I looked at her with a big frown on my face as her chest heaved due to the lack of oxygen in her lungs. She was breathing heavily as she rested her hands on her knees to take deep heavy breaths to even her breathing. Her face flushed all because of running with her long black hair slipping out of her ponytail as sweat beats were raining from her forehead on her face making her milky white skin gland in the sun. She is the prettiest girl I know with her long hair and milky skin whereas I was more like a tomboy with my short brown hair.

""What happened Ella,"" I asked with a frown on my face as I looked at her while adjusting my bag's strap again on my shoulder, securing them there again.

""Luna, we need you,"" she said in between heavy breaths as she tried to control her breath as she still supported her weary body on her knees with the support of her hands.

""Now what happened. You know I won't come, I'm going back today,"" I said, refusing her as I looked at the big gates. I don't want to be late when my dad comes to take me.

""B--but the C wing team of girls has declared a match on us and if we lose they will tag us losers for the whole year,"" she said in her horrified voice, getting my attention for a split of seconds.

""Did they forget how we defeated them last week?"" I said in a mocking tone as I looked at the long road from where all the cars enter the school premises.

""They didn't! That's the reason they choose today to take their revenge when you are leaving,"" she said in her controlled voice as she straightened her body to face me.

""I know you can define them so go back,"" I said in my agitated voice as I tap my feet on the ground while biting my lower lip knowing they need me but dad will be here anytime to take me.

""Come on Luna, if we lose we will be losers for the whole year,"" she said in her pleading voice making me avert my eyes from the road to her as she pleaded to me with her puppy eyes. I exhaled loudly knowing I won't be able to live the whole year with a tag of a loser. I looked at the road and then back to her as I had made up my mind. I can't let my team down.

""Let's go and teach them less for messing with me at the wrong time,"" I said as I stood up from my seat as a bolt of anger ran in me. They purposely chose this time so they could win against us thinking I will leave my team behind just like that. I couldn't never in my nightmare let my team be a loser for a whole year. Listing to my words Ella gave me her big smile as she did her little happy dance as she was successful in convincing me. In no time I was standing on the football ground with a ball in my hand dressed in my football spandex and jersey on which my name was written in bold letters. Beside me was standing Ella and the rest of the team members.

""What is this you gave me the information that A-wings captain was going home today then why the hell she hears"" I heard a C wings captain asking her team member as she looked at me with narrowed eyes. I moved my hand in my short ear-length hair and to my lips blowing her a flying kiss as a greeting making her face twitch in anger. She still has grudges against me because I beat her very badly in our last match. I didn't even let her score a single goal.

""Ready for a rematch,"" I asked with a smirk, making her curl her fingers in a fist.

""Be ready to lose, losers"" she said in anger as she saw me smirking in her direction.

""We will see,"" I said with the same smirk, making her grind her teeth.

""Let's start the match,"" Ella said in her loud voice as I heard wise being blown. And like that our match of pride started.

""I won't let you win this time"" the C wing football team captain yelled as she ran towards me to kick the ball which was placed on the center. Like she said she played dirty like always trying to win the match but my team didn't let their dirty trick pass. We won the match as Ella scored two goals with a ruptured elbow and I scored four goals in the process of rupturing my knees. My other team members too had bruises on their legs and arms. On another hand, C wing teams' girls were limping as they walked in defeat out of the ground.

""See you at next match losses until then practice how to play football,"" I said in a mocking tone as she was limping towards her Wing with the support of her team members.

""Yes we did it guys,"" Ella said in victory followed by a groan as her arm hurt as she tried to dance, making me and my team laugh at her enthusiasm. We rounded up together jumping at our victory.

""Luna Davis, your dad is here to take you."" I heard one of the sisters calling my name as I was laughing with Ella still enjoying our victory.

""Coming sister"" I yelled back, making her go back in and I looked at Ella who had a sad expression on her face.

""I will miss you,"" Ella said as she hugged me.

""You know you can come with me. You are always welcome"" I said in my soft voice as I broke the hug and tugged her long stray hair behind her ear. I feel bad for her knowing she had no one to spend her summer vacation with. Even though I had not seen my mother I have dad beside me in this big world but Ella has only me as she was an orphan.

""I know but you know I'm going to go and help in an old age home for the rest of my summer vacation,"" she said with a big smile on her face as she masked her pain behind her happy eyes. This is one of the best qualities of Ella. She is always happy even if she is hurting inside. She was so mature for a fifteen-year-old unlike me.

""Call me every day when you return from old age house,"" I said in my same soft voice as I nodded my head in understanding.

""Bring me chocolates when you come back. I hope this time you will share your special chocolate with me"" she said with a mischievous smile on her face, making me blush. She knows I never share them with anyone and that's why she enjoys teasing me.

""I need to go, I will see you as soon as our break is over,"" I said, still blushing while running towards the tree where my bag was laying, not promising if I would share my special chocolates with her. Securing my bag on my shoulders I ran to the office where my dad would be waiting for me not before waving bye to Ella behind my back.

""Dad"" I squealed as soon as his tall frame appeared in my vision as I ran towards him.

""Oh, my football champion is finally here,"" dad said in his happy voice as he lifted me in his arms and hugged me as he was whirling both of us.

""Did you win again?"" he asked me in his proud voice.

""Yes I scored the winning goal,"" I said happily as I nodded in yes with a big smile on my face.

""I'm proud of you,"" he said with a big smile on his face.

""Dad let me down, I'm too old for you to carry me to the car,"" I said while laughing as he started to walk towards the door with me still in his arms.

""You are still my baby so let me carry you,"" he said in his protesting voice as he carried me towards the car adjusting my five-four frame in his arms. I tried to slip down but he didn't let me down until we reached the car. Soon we were on our way to our home which I missed so much. Once the car was near our destination the excitement and the giddiness I was feeling since morning was back.

""Dad, are we going to go to the Riviera Mansion first?"" I asked with raised eyes as I tried to mask my excitement.

""Not today love, we will go there tomorrow everyone is eager to meet you,"" he said with a smile while looking at me but then he averted his eyes back on the road.

""Really,"" I asked even though I know they miss me. He nodded, still focusing on the road.

""Yesterday Grandma was asking me when were you coming back,"" he said with a smile on his face as he read my hidden emotions before I could mask them properly. I was never good at hiding anything from dad.

""Hmmm"" I hummed in response as I nodded at him. I bit my lower lip, stopping myself from asking what I was dying to ask as soon he said everyone missed me. That question was on the tip of my tongue so I pressed my lips together as I rested my head on my seat while turning my head to look out of the window to distract myself. But the question which I couldn't utter out of my mouth kept repeating in my mind.

Is he eager to meet me too?

Does he remember the promise he made me five years ago?

# Chapter 2

Does he remember the promise he made me?

I was so lost in my thoughts that I didn't realise when I slumped on my seat as exhaustion took over me. Next time I open my eyes I find myself snuggling in my blanket on my bed in my bedroom. I blinked my eyes to clear my vision. I removed my blanket and placed my legs on the floor. I was still dressed in my football jersey.

Dad must have put me to bed.

I stared at them after looking at the smiley bandage on my both knees. He always does that when I'm asleep because I whine at him every time saying I'm not a kid anymore and he would reply to me saying I'm still a kid to him. I went to the bathroom to take a shower as it was already dinner time. I stripped out of my clothes and took a warm shower as my muscles ache a little bit because of sleeping in the car throughout the ride. My bruises stung as warm water touched them. I ignored it and soon came out of the bathroom as my stomach growled. The last meal I had was my breakfast and now I was so hungry so I soon slipped into my pyjamas and went down following the delicious scent of fried chicken coming from the kitchen.

""What special for dinner today,"" I said as I took my seat on a high chair as I took a piece of fried chicken from which dad had placed beside the stove.

""Spaghetti with spicy fried chicken. Be careful it's still hot,"" he said as he had just now taken them out of hot oil. I still took a big piece of it and took a hearty bite.

""Hmmm, dad it's so spicy, juicy, and tasty just as I like,"" I said with my mouth still chewing on it as I took one more bite of it. He smiled looking at my face. He was done frying the chicken and in the meantime, I was done eating four pieces of chicken. He took the food to the table as I was done eating my fourth chicken piece and was now licking my fingers.

""Lu, bring us water with you and come to eat your dinner,"" he yelled from the dining area as he was done setting the table. I grabbed the jar of water and two glasses for us. I took my seat and dad put the big share of spaghetti on my plate with more spicy chicken pieces.

""Dad I'm already half full,"" I said looking at my plate with a pout on my lips.

""Finish it then you will get ice cream as dessert,"" he said with a smile on his face. He knows this trick always works on me.

""Dad, it's bribing,"" I said while looking at him with narrowed eyes. Well, I'm not complaining.

""So you don't want ice cream then I will finish it on my own,"" he said while putting the spaghetti in my mouth as I was about to disagree. I chewed on it fast to talk again but he again put a spoon full of spaghetti in my mouth.

""Dad,"" I said, still with a mouth full of food, making him laugh. We had the rest of the dinner with me telling him stories about my school and hostel about me and some about Ella. He laughed listening to my story about how we coloured our chemistry teacher's face purple by mixing the chemical and asked her to check it and poof her face was purple.

After that, I and Ella had to clean the garden for a whole week as our teacher complained to our head sister. Dad never stopped me from doing anything mischievous; he even sometimes gave me ideas but always warned me never to hurt someone. He never stopped me from being myself. My aged girls liked to dress up and grow their hair till their waist learning how to do makeup but I never was interested in those things. I like my hair short and I feel comfortable in my football jersey. I could go weeks wearing that.

""Dad I'm full, I can't eat anymore,"" I said as I couldn't eat more while slumping in my chair as my tummy was so full that I couldn't even lift my finger. ""You didn't even eat anything,"" dad said moving his head as he took my plate to finish it.

""Dad, if I continued eating like that there will be two balls on the football ground when I go back to school after vacation,"" I said with a horrified expression on my face which made him laugh. After dinner, we decided to watch a movie with ice cream in our hands. Dad first didn't give me ice cream, teasing me saying I was full.

""Dad there is always lots of room in my stomach for ice cream,"" I said and took it from his hand. Dad slept in half the movie so I completed the movie after covering him with a blanket as I snuggled beside him in the same blanket. I know he was tired from his work but he still wanted to spend time with me. So do I. I miss him so badly when I'm back at school. In the morning when I opened my eyes I again found myself in my bed. In this house where I sleep, I found myself in bed the next time I opened my eyes. Courtesy goes to my dad. I rubbed my eyes as I took a deep sniff of air around me. I woke up after smelling something sweet. Without wasting time I ran down to find dad making pancakes for me.

""Pancakes,"" I said in my delighted voice as I saw dad making a stack of it. I ran to eat it but dad pushed my hand away.

""First go and brush your teeth and wash your face too. I can see drawl running all over your cheeks"" dad said in his firm voice as he pointed at my cheeks making me immediately lift my hand to wipe it but nothing was there.

""Dad,"" I said as he teased me, making me laugh at my reaction.

""Go fast, get ready, and come down. I will take you to the Riviera mansion after breakfast"" dad said, making me run back to my bedroom to change fast before he could say anything more. I was eager to go to the Riviera mansion. When I went down dressed in my oversized t-shirt and ripped jeans I found dad sitting on the table with a newspaper dress for his work.

""Come I was waiting for you,"" dad said, keeping the paper aside as he smiled at me. We had our breakfast together with me eating in a hurry so we can leave soon. Dad moved his head in amusement as he saw me eating fast as he was sipping on his coffee.

""Let's go,"" I said as I kept my empty juice glass back.

""You broke your record of eating breakfast so fast. Last time you took ten minutes and today only five"" he said looking at his wristwatch in his amused voice as he laughed at me seeing my eagerness to go there.

""Dad, now let's go, you will be late for your work,"" I said in my serious voice as I ran towards the door with him following me. In fifteen minutes we reached there as it was not that far away from where we stayed. A maid opened the door for us and I ran into the house as I always used to do as a kid.

""Grandma"" I screamed on top of my lungs as I saw her sitting in the living room talking with aunty Charlotte.

""Oh my what a surprise my beautiful Luna is home,"" she said heartily as she opened her arms to engulf me in them.

""I missed you so much,"" I said like ten years old as she patted me on my back lovingly.

""Everyone misses the only grandma no one misses me"" I heard aunty Charlotte saying in her sad voice making me look at her with a grin.

""I missed you too aunty,"" I said as I hugged her now while moving out of grandma's arms.

""You know all my friends liked the muffins you sent me last time,"" I said with a big smile on my face.

""I will make more for you so you can take some for your friends but before I give it to you,"" she said with a pleased smile on her face. Aunty Charlotte always liked to feed everyone.

""Charlotte, don't spoil her, '' dad said as he took his seat beside grandmas after saying good morning to them.

""You didn't even give me a chance to spoil her. I told you so many times that I will take care of her but now you have to go and put my delicate child in the hostel,"" aunty said in her firm voice as she once again showed dad her disapproval for sending me away.

""I know you will take care of me more than me but I also know how naughty my daughter is. You know what she did to her chemistry teacher"" and just like that dad told them all my doings making them laugh.

""Honey come here let me see you properly,"" grandma said after some time so I stood up and went near her.

""You have grown so tall and beautiful just like your mother,"" she said lovingly as she patted my cheeks.

""Girls grow so fast. It feels like she was a toddler yesterday and now all grown up"" dad said in his heavy voice. I could see he didn't like me to grow up. He wanted me to be still his small Luna who runs behind him with a running nose.

""Stop all your emotional talks. So Luna, have you decided what you will do on your sixteenth birthday"" aunty asked me in her excited voice as she wiped the corner of her eyes. Yes, I was going to turn sixteen in a few days. I went on with what I had decided to do and they all listened with lots of patience. After some time dad left for the office.

He worked in the Riviera industry as a manager. Dad and Uncle John were friends from University after graduation. Uncle John asked to join him in his father's company and since then they have worked together. We are like a family. All of them love me. All of them and suddenly I remembered the reason why I wanted to come back here. I asked aunty about him. She told me he was coming back from California for his summer break. It was his last year in college. I was still talking with them when I heard the horns of the car.

""I think he is here,"" aunty said with a big smile on her face.

""I will go and open the door"" saying that I ran towards the door before a maid could do it. With a big smile on my face, I opened the door as I felt the same giddiness I was feeling yesterday to see him after a year. I saw him getting out of the car and then another boy his age got out of the car then next thing I saw the smile disappeared from my face. A beautiful woman wearing a mini dress stepped out of his car and clasped his arm making my heart sink to my stomach.

I don‚Äôt have a way to see a doctor until June but I‚Äôve been having digestive issues for months now: 

- cramping, gas and swooshing liquid buildup in lower (right) side of stomach when eating the FODMAP triggers like garlic and onions

- intense and near immediate bloating even after eating non-triggers like chicken and rice, especially when hot/cooked apparently

- Bloating or pressure in upper abdomen with a slight but uncomfortable sharp sensation by the heart/ribs

- No real diarrhea but often clumpy, oily, dark stools and I usually have to go right after eating and can go 3-4 times in a day despite not eating much at all

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing this but there‚Äôs a few options:

- My diet until recently was almost exclusively (A LOT) of black coffee paired with green apples, peanut butter, nuts and multivitamins (could the acidity of the coffee or my lack of diversity have messed with my ability to digest?)
- General IBS/digestive issues that run on my paternal side (but it‚Äôs usually more specific to certain foods and kicked in later in life for them)
- Stress and anxiety; the last few months have been particularly rough mentally/financially and during recent arguments with my girlfriend is when I started noticing this ‚Äúball/tension‚Äù in my stomach
- I‚Äôm a heavy smoker of concentrated THC in vape form, I don‚Äôt know if perhaps this is messing with my ‚Äúdigestive muscles‚Äù

The alarm woke Bella up. She looked at her phone and saw that it was 5 am, as always. Bella enjoyed routines. That was a lie. Bella lived for her routines. Each weekday she had her morning routine down to an art. All ending in her arriving at the office, ten minutes before her bosses got there.

To say that her bosses was as depended on chaos as she was on routines was an understatement. Alpha and luna Heartstone were the definition of alpha wolves. They were confident, assertive, skilled at decision-making, and intelligent. But that also meant that they had a habit of giving their attention to where it was needed.

That was where Bella came into the picture. Her duty as their personal assistant was to create order out of chaos. She would make sure that they didn‚Äôt lose track of the big picture. She would also make sure that they coordinated the two sides of the business. This meant that they were aware of upcoming deadlines as well as, most important of all, getting their decisions and ideas out to the rest of the company in a way that was clear and understandable.

Bella was an omega, that meant that she was at the bottom of the rank order in the pack. At the top, there was the alpha and the luna. Then came the beta and his mate. They acted as stand-ins for the alpha and luna if needed and were the closest advisors to them.

Then there was the gamma. That was the pack‚Äôs strongest warrior. Next in the order came the warriors, called deltas. They trained and pushed their bodies to the max and would sacrifice their own lives in order to keep their pack safe.

Epsilon was the everyday wolf. They weren‚Äôt at the top, but they weren‚Äôt at the bottom either. Last came the omegas, the submissive. They were the soft and tender wolves that cared for everyone and accepted orders.

Bella knew that there were omegas that were ashamed of their status, or that wished that they had a higher rank. But Bella didn‚Äôt care. She may not be the most assertive person in her personal life, but at work, she was known for making people move.

While at work she wasn‚Äôt Bella the omega, she was Bella the alpha‚Äôs and luna‚Äôs assistant. She acted with their authority, not her own.

As Bella entered the office building, the guard at the entrance desk greeted her. Bella knew the names of all the guards, as well as their mates and children.

‚ÄúYou are three minutes early today, Bella,‚Äù Charlie, the guard on duty, chuckled.

‚ÄúI was feeling like taking a quick nap before the bosses arrive Charlie,‚Äù Bella joked. She heard him chuckling as she walked towards the express elevator that was only used by her, her bosses, and important guests.

As the elevator moved upward, soft, calming music played. Her satchel bag hung from her shoulder with her pad and laptop in it. With a soft ding, the elevator door opened, and she stepped out onto the empty top floor.

They reserved the top floor for the bosses. As soon as you got of the elevator, you were greeted by the company logo, HEI, Heartstone Entertainment Industry.

The large windows to the right that showed the city scape were framed by heavy velvet curtains in a deep teal colour. Against the dividing wall toward the elevators, there were two sofas. On the left side of the room were two meeting rooms, one large and one smaller

There were two doors that led toward other rooms that you couldn‚Äôt see into. One led to the kitchen and the other to the guest bathroom. On the far wall, there were two doors. Infront of them stood a large desk. That was Bella‚Äôs desk. The doors behind her led into the bosses‚Äô offices.

Bella smiled and put her satchel down on her desk. Whilst humming a soft melody, she made her way into the kitchen and started making the coffee.

While she waited for the coffee, she brought up the bosses‚Äô schedule for today on her tablet and quickly glanced through it. She heard the elevator ding, and her bosses came walking in. Alpha Sam had his arm around his luna‚Äôs shoulders as usual.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Bella greeted them with a smile, holding out the coffee.

‚ÄúGood morning, Bella, thank you,‚Äù alpha Sam said.

‚ÄúMorning Bee, you‚Äôre a lifesaver as usual,‚Äù luna Alice said, taking a big gulp of coffee.

All three of them walked into the door on their right, luna Alice‚Äôs office, and the alpha sank into the sofa, placing luna Alice in his lap.

‚ÄúToday looks like a fairly quiet day,‚Äù Bella said. ‚ÄúLuna Alice, you have the meeting with the mayor‚Äôs husband to go over the plan for the Easter party. Alpha Sam, you have a conference call with the head of the northern Europe branch to discuss the recent developments over there. You need to complete the pack budget and give it to me by 11am. I‚Äôll make copies of it to have on hand for the afternoon meeting,‚Äù she continued.

‚ÄúYou will end the day at lunch. I have talked with the pack cook. She is expecting you back and will have lunch ready and then you have the meeting with the pack leadership,‚Äù she finished.

‚ÄúThank you, Bella. I will have the budget done in time for you,‚Äù alpha Sam nodded.

‚ÄúYou will join us this afternoon, right?‚Äù luna Alice asked.

‚ÄúYes, I will be there to take notes as per usual,‚Äù Bella confirmed.

‚ÄúVery well, and I insist you spend the night. You really need to come out to the pack ground more often, Bee,‚Äù the luna insisted.

‚ÄúI know, I will try luna,‚Äù Bella replied.

‚ÄúGood, I‚Äôll hold you to it. Well, we better get started if we are to be finished by lunch,‚Äù the beautiful blond she-wolf said, placing a peck on her husband‚Äôs cheek before trying to stand up. The alpha didn‚Äôt seem to appreciate the small gesture, so he pulled her down for a kiss. Bella left the room. You never knew where things would end up when those two got started.

An hour later alpha Sam mind linked Bella.

‚ÄòBella, make sure the car we use to get home in are of security standard one,‚Äô he told her.

‚ÄòYes, alpha,‚Äô she answered.

Why is he asking for a full armoured car with special anti-magical protection? She wondered. Those were only used is situations with a realistic threat from the magical community. She mind linked Joey, that was the alpha couples usual driver.

‚ÄòHey Joey, the boss wants a class one car to take them home,‚Äô she linked him.

‚ÄòNo problem miss Lightpaw, are we expecting trouble?‚Äô he asked.

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm guessing so. The alpha didn‚Äôt give me any details. But we don‚Äôt use that type of car just for fun,‚Äô she answered.

‚ÄòRight. I‚Äôll make the arrangements and make sure we have a trailing car, just to be on the safe side,‚Äô he told her.

‚ÄòThanks Joey.‚Äô

‚ÄòAlpha, Joey will have the car ready for you. He‚Äôll also arrange a tail,‚Äô Bella mind linked alpha Sam.

‚ÄòThank you, Bella.‚Äô

Alpha Sam had the budget ready half an hour before the deadline and Bella was grateful. After getting the folders ready, she mind linked both of her bosses to tell them they were leaving in ten minutes.

Together with the alpha and luna, she rode down in the express elevator and mind linked Joey, their driver, to let him know they were on their way. As Joey held open the door to let the bosses slide into the backseat, Bella climbed into the passenger seat in front.

The ride to the pack land took about twenty minutes and as soon as they passed the border, Bella felt the shift and a calm settled in her. She loved being back at the pack land. It was beautiful, with miles of untouched forests. She was itching to head out for a run. But it had to wait until after the meeting.

Another ten minutes‚Äô drive and the pack house came into view. It was an impressive traditional log house, only a couple of sizes bigger than usual, surrounded by flowerbeds and gravel paths. As they pulled up to it, the alpha and the luna headed towards the dining room.

When luna Alice noticed Bella didn‚Äôt follow them, she turned around to look for her assistant.

‚ÄúBee, where are you off to?"" she asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading to the kitchen to grab a sandwich and then I‚Äôll prepare the meeting room for the leader meeting,‚Äù Bella answered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not eating with us?‚Äù the alpha asked.

‚ÄúI thought you and luna would like some time for yourself,‚Äù she answered with a smile.

‚ÄúOh please, I spend most of my day with this ogre. I need some intelligent conversation,‚Äù luna Alice complained.

‚ÄúHun‚Äô, am I not enough for you?‚Äù the alpha asked, looking like a lost puppy. Bella had to look away so she wouldn‚Äôt laugh.

‚ÄúBabe, you know I love you with body and soul. But I need some girl-talk to keep my mind from going insane,‚Äù the luna cooed and placed a light kiss on her husband‚Äôs lips.

‚ÄúWell, I guess I have to settle for that,‚Äù the alpha smiled.

‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs settled, Bee you are eating with us‚Äù

‚ÄúYes luna‚Äù Bella confirmed and followed her bosses into the dining room where she joined them at the head table.

The lunch was pleasant, luna Alice made sure that Bella was caught up with the latest gossip of the pack.

They are the poster couple for mates, Bella thought as she saw the alpha couple. They were true mates, and no one would doubt it. Every werewolf hoped to find their true mate, the one that the goddess had chosen for you.

But as more and more wolves had lived in the human society and were influenced by their customs, true mates were becoming rarer.

**Rogues**

Many wolves didn‚Äôt have the patience to wait for their true mate and instead they settled for a chosen one.

Bella wasn‚Äôt sure she would have a mate at all. It wasn‚Äôt for a lack of options. She usually got offers for dates regularly. But she never allowed herself to believe that it was because of her looks or personality. No, it was because she was an omega.

Although omegas were the lowest in rank, they were sought after as mates, especially the female ones. Because of their caring nature, and the tradition said that they were more fertile than other werewolves. That made them top picks for all male wolves, regardless of rank.

But Bella didn‚Äôt want a relationship based on her rank. If she was to have a mate, it needed to be someone who loved her for who she was, not what she was. She knew that the odds of meeting one‚Äôs true mate were low. But she was prepared to live alone if it came to that. She had a good life.

‚ÄúThere are several unmated males that ask about you‚Äù the luna said, wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.

‚ÄúWell, that doesn‚Äôt interest me, you know that,‚Äù Bella said, feeling her cheeks getting warm.

‚ÄúNever say never my friend,‚Äù luna Alice smiled.

‚ÄúMy little match maker,‚Äù the alpha laughed.

Bella smiled and then she excused herself to get the meeting room prepared for the pack leadership meeting.

On her way to the meeting room, she almost ran in to Mark, the pack gamma.

‚ÄòHey there Bella, are you okay?‚Äù he asked as he grabbed her shoulders to keep her from bumping into him full speed.

‚ÄúOh, Mark, sorry. Yes, I‚Äôm fine. Just had my focus on what I needed to to prepare for the meeting,‚Äù she said, taking a stap back to make him let go of her.

‚ÄúYou have to be careful, we don‚Äôt want you getting hurt,‚Äù he said with a smile, keeping his hands on her shoulders.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not as fragile as I look. I need to dash, sorry again for trying to run over you,‚Äù Bella said, she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with his touch.

‚ÄúNo worries, I‚Äôll see you at the meeting,‚Äù he told her, finally letting go of her so that she could walk around him.

She walked quickly to the meeting room and was relived to see that another pack member was in the room, placing water and snacks on the table. Bella didn‚Äôt know why, but she didn‚Äôt want to be alone.

Besides the alpha couple, the beta and gamma were to attend the meeting. Four elders were invited alongside the former alpha. One elder was Bella‚Äôs father. He smiled as he entered the meeting room.

‚ÄúHello there, peanut,‚Äù he greeted her as he opened his arms.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù she said, pretending to be annoyed while sliding into his arms and giving him a hug.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll always be my peanut, peanut,‚Äù he said, laughing as he let her go and took his seat.

The former alpha came next and greeted her happily before taking a seat next to her father. The two of them had always been friends, despite the difference in rank.

‚ÄúPlease, sit down and let‚Äôs get the meeting started,‚Äù alpha Sam said. Bella closed the door and took her seat behind the alpha. She wasn‚Äôt part of the meeting, but was the one that kept notes and took care of the practical things.

After going through and approving the budget, the topic was changed.

‚ÄúThis morning there was a rogue attack on the Redriver pack,‚Äù alpha Sam said. There was murmur amongst the wolves.

The Redriver pack was their closest neighbouring pack and Bella now understood the class one car the alpha had ordered.

There had been a sudden increase in rogue attacks. It wasn‚Äôt just their pack that had seen this pattern. Packs all across the US had seen the same thing, according to alpha Sam. The attacks hadn‚Äôt just become more frequent, they had become more ruthless and the number of dead and injured wolves got higher for each attack.

‚ÄúI have talked to several alphas around the country, and we agree that this is something that we need to cooperate to resolve,‚Äù alpha Sam told them. ‚ÄúI have offered that HEI will arrange a summit on this topic and I‚Äôm happy to say that it was accepted,‚Äù he continued.

This surprised Bella. It was unusual for such a gathering of pack representatives. Usually, it was just the closest packs that got together to discuss things or have pack parties to make sure that unmated members had time to meet. If packs had blood ties, especially in the alpha family, they allied with each other.

But otherwise, most packs didn‚Äôt trust each other and preferred to keep to themselves. Werewolves were territorial creatures.

‚ÄúWe are going to meet at the start of the blood moon. It gives us a little over a month to make this happen people. I expect nothing but the best from all of you,‚Äù he concluded.

After the meeting was done, Bella talked to her father for a bit. He then headed off to have a beer with the former alpha and she wanted to go for a run.

Bella climbed the stairs to her room. Even though she had an apartment in the city, she also had a room in the pack house.

The first floor of the house was dedicated to communal spaces. The second floor consisted of rooms for epsilons and omegas. Half of the third floor was dedicated to the beta and gamma families, and the rest were apartments for the warriors. The top floor was for the alpha family, including the alpha‚Äôs and luna‚Äôs offices.

Bella should have a room on the second floor. But luna Alice had told her it was out of the question. As their personal assistant, Bella needed to be close to the alpha couple. That is why she got a small apartment close to the stairs on the warriors‚Äô side of the third floor.

She needed to change out of her work clothes and go for a run. It was Friday, so she could stay for the weekend and return to the city on Monday. She could spend some time with her father and go for long runs in the woods.

She mind linked luna Alice to tell her she was going for a run. She found a suitable tree to slip behind and strip. It only took seconds before a small, lean, dark brown wolf stood where Bella had been. She was definitely an omega wolf. Luna Alice always said that Bella‚Äôs wolf was cute and dainty.

Although Bella didn‚Äôt exactly like being called dainty, she had to admit that her wolf didn‚Äôt look big or scary. But she was fast and agile, which often surprised other wolves.

When she got over the first joy of the run, her human brain could focus on solving all the ins and outs of her thoughts.

The most prominent topic this evening was the upcoming summit. HEI was split into two areas. The first business that was run by the luna was an event planning business.

The other part, run by the alpha, offered security solutions. That included everything from bodyguards to cooperation data security.

They worked in both the human world and the supernatural one, with remarkable success in both.

As such, HEI was perfect for putting this summit together. Luna Alice would plan an amazing and stunning event, as she always did. And with so many pack top ranks in one place, the security needed to be on point. Alpha Sam would make sure of that.

In the middle, there would be Bella. It would be her job, as always, to make sure that the two sides worked together. She smiled in her mind and realized she was looking forward to it. Yes, it would be hectic and a lot of work. But she didn‚Äôt mind. She knew it would be exciting.

Back in her room, she mind linked her father asking if she could stop by the next day and they planned a father and daughter day.

The next day, she headed to her father‚Äôs cottage after breakfast. He greeted her, as usual, with a warm hug and a big smile. Since her mother had passed away three years ago, her father was the only family she had.

That her father was alive and in relatively sound health, both mentally and physically, was a testament to his strength. Most wolves that lost their mate, especially a true mate, would fade away.

But her father, a simple omega, had kept going. Not that he wasn‚Äôt affected by the loss. He had spent the better part of six months in bed. But he refused to let go. He would tell those who asked that it was because of his need to be there for his daughter. He couldn‚Äôt in good conscience leave her without a family.

Bella had always been a daddy‚Äôs girl, and his determination to stay with her deepened the bond between the two.

After spending a couple of hours playing canasta, playing for snickerdoodles her father had made, they sat on the porch talking and eating sandwiches, drinking iced tea. In the afternoon, they settled in to watch a couple of old movies and ended the day with a BBQ. It was a perfect day in Bella‚Äôs mind.

The weekend passed by too quickly and before she knew it; she was sitting in the car with the alpha and luna, heading back to the city.

She should spend more time in the pack. She liked it. There was nothing like running in the woods or spending time with her father. But the commute was not something she enjoyed. Even though her bosses offered that she could ride with them. She enjoyed being the first one in the office.

The coming four weeks were intense beyond anything Bella had experienced before. The logistics was complicated when trying to take rivalries and allies into account.

At least once a day alpha Sam lost his patients and Bella had to get the luna to calm him down. The last week before the summit should start, Bella asked the luna to work out of the alpha‚Äôs office. It saved them all time and sanity points. Bella couldn‚Äôt wait for the summit to be over and life to go back to normal.",1,1747333529.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt have a way to see a doctor until June but I‚Äôve been having digestive issues for months now: 

- cramping, gas and swooshing liquid buildup in lower (right) side of stomach when eating the FODMAP triggers like garlic and onions

- intense and near immediate bloating even after eating non-triggers like chicken and rice, especially when hot/cooked apparently

- Bloating or pressure in upper abdomen with a slight but uncomfortable sharp sensation by the heart/ribs

- No real diarrhea but often clumpy, oily, dark stools and I usually have to go right after eating and can go 3-4 times in a day despite not eating much at all

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing this but there‚Äôs a few options:

- My diet until recently was almost exclusively (A LOT) of black coffee paired with green apples, peanut butter, nuts and multivitamins (could the acidity of the coffee or my lack of diversity have messed with my ability to digest?)
- General IBS/digestive issues that run on my paternal side (but it‚Äôs usually more specific to certain foods and kicked in later in life for them)
- Stress and anxiety; the last few months have been particularly rough mentally/financially and during recent arguments with my girlfriend is when I started noticing this ‚Äúball/tension‚Äù in my stomach
- I‚Äôm a heavy smoker of concentrated THC in vape form, I don‚Äôt know if perhaps this is messing with my ‚Äúdigestive muscles‚Äù

Does this sound like anyone here and if so 1) what do you think is the main cause? 2) what should be my course of actions once i have doctor money 3) what everyday things have you found that help (simethicone, apple cidar vinegar, probiotics, enzymes etc)

Looked like another GNC reject at first.

Another pre-stim blend with pump ingredients and some adaptogens?

But this one had no caffeine, no beta alanine, no creatine bloat.

Just a weird mix of blood flow, mood, and antioxidant stuff.

So I ran it clean.

30 days, no other supps, no pre-workout drinks.

Here‚Äôs how it played out.

# Week 1: the warm-up

I didn‚Äôt feel anything dramatic.

But workouts didn‚Äôt suck.

That was my first clue.

Usually first week back after a break, I drag hard.

But I didn‚Äôt.

No jitters, no crash, no shaky aggression.

Just this low-key energy that didn‚Äôt fade.

I didn‚Äôt expect 1g of citrulline to do much, but somehow the combo worked.

Could be the ginseng + ginkgo + CoQ10.

Or maybe I just slept better?

Tried training fasted and felt a little flat. Won‚Äôt do that again.

# Week 2: mood shift

This week caught me off guard.

Felt calmer than usual.

Not dull. Just steady.

Traffic didn‚Äôt bother me. Emails didn‚Äôt set me off.

Rhodiola usually wrecks my sleep, but this didn‚Äôt.

Actually started looking forward to training.

Recovery wasn‚Äôt faster, but I was more consistent.

Didn‚Äôt feel like skipping.

Kind of like the baseline noise in my brain turned down.

# Week 3: surprise pump

Did legs.

Felt like my quads were inflating.

Weird because there‚Äôs no beta alanine or big nitrate dose.

But I looked down mid-set and thought, huh, that‚Äôs new.

Citrulline + arginine + quercetin maybe?

Or maybe the resveratrol was doing something behind the scenes.

Either way, gym volume went up.

Mid-set I caught myself zoning in like I used to with old Jack3d.

Didn‚Äôt need to hype myself into it.

It was just go time.

# Week 4: all clicks together

This week was the smoothest.

No pre. No energy drinks. Just woke up, took it, trained.

No stomach issues, no crash after.

Even libido felt up (maybe the ginseng + forskohlii?)

I wasn‚Äôt expecting that at all.

I still missed caffeine some mornings, but I didn‚Äôt *need* it.

Mood stayed clean. No edge, no snap.

Didn‚Äôt blast me off‚Äîjust kept the wheels turning.

Had heartburn after taking it with black coffee‚Äîbad combo.

# Pros

* No caffeine or crash  
* Surprisingly clean mood support  
* Pumps kicked in around week 3  
* Easy to stack with other things  
* Libido boost was unexpected

# Cons

* 1g citrulline isn‚Äôt enough for real nitric oxide freaks  
* Capsaicin gave me light heartburn once (esp. with coffee)  
* Took it dry once and felt light nausea  
* No B vitamins or electrolytes  
* Takes 2+ weeks to really feel

# Verdict

Heart of Steel doesn‚Äôt feel like a stimheavy pre.

It‚Äôs more like a background upgrade than a turbo shot.

It‚Äôs not for PR chasing junkies.

It‚Äôs for consistent energy, mental steadiness, and clean gym days.

For me, it worked better than expected.

My sister got married at twenty and had my nephew at twenty-one. Me? Twenty-seven, still unmarried.

Over the years, I've brought several boyfriends home. Each time, my dad invites them into his study for a ""chat.""

But every single guy who walks out of that study‚Äîguys who were all lovey-dovey with me before‚Äîsuddenly gives me the cold shoulder afterward. Some even look like they literally want to strangle me.

And the latest guy? He thought my dad was a total jerk and swore he'd stand up for me. But after he stormed out the study, he dumped me on the spot, and even slapped me across the face twice.

I'm completely baffled. What's the real reason they all leave me? What secrets in that study??

\---

""You are such a disgusting slut!""

""Next time I should just let your boyfriends kill you. Maybe then you'd learn your lesson!""

After my boyfriend stormed out, Dad turned on me, face twisted with rage.

Actually, I've dated five guys over the years. Every single relationship ended the same way‚Äîbadly. And every single guy changed after visiting Dad's study.

I'd like to believe people don't change that quickly, but the evidence is right in front of me.

I frowned at Dad, waiting for an apology that would never come.

The look in his eyes said he'd rather tear me apart.

He seemed genuinely disappointed my boyfriend hadn't strangled me on the spot.

Dad's always favored my sister. When I first wanted to date as a teenager, he forced me to break up immediately. Meanwhile, my sister got married the second she turned twenty. Why the double standard?

Watching my brother-in-law move in, seeing how tenderly he treated my sister every day‚ÄîI envied their happiness, their future together.

Whenever I looked their way, Dad kicked me to the ground, screaming that I should never even think about marriage.

When my sister and her husband went abroad for their honeymoon, Dad made me kneel at home as punishment for... just being me, I guessed.

He even had my sister tell me not to get married, saying I'd ""ruin someone's life.""

I've wondered if maybe I was adopted, but hired a private investigator who confirmed I's definitely his biological daughter.

Totally lost, I vented online. The guesses came pouring in:

""Maybe you were born on the day of his big business deal? Cost him millions, so now he's getting revenge.""

""Bet you look like his mistress and your mom hates you for it, so your dad also hates you.""

So I started snooping again, but Dad's a teacher, never had any business dealings. And he's never cheated‚Äînot once.

I just didn't understand why he's so determined to keep me single forever.

The irony? I's gorgeous. I meet amazing guys constantly, but nothing ever works out.

Finally desperate, I asked my uncle to talk some sense into Dad.

""Your daughter's found someone she loves,"" Uncle told him. ""Parents should support their children's happiness, not mess up. What's wrong with you?""

Dad said nothing. He just stared at my uncle, grabbed his hand, and led him into the study.

Chapter 2

After they left the study, Uncle's once gentle gaze had turned into nasty and mean. He not only dropped the ""let me date"" talk, he even kicked me straight in the chest.

""You worthless bitch! You think you deserve love at your age? As if!""

My aunt arrived looking for Uncle, witnessed the whole scene, and tore into him. But after Dad took her into that damn study too, she came out telling me I should forget about marriage forever or she'd poison me herself.

Something was seriously wrong. What the hell was in my father's study that could completely flip someone's entire attitude toward me?

Even my little sister‚Äîwe've been close our whole lives‚Äîstarted lecturing me about how I should ""enjoy being single"" and ""why ruin that with marriage?""

She secretly burned all my photos with ex-boyfriends and blocked their numbers in my phone, determined to keep me from having any contact with men.

I lay awake at night, my mind racing. The whole situation was beyond creepy.

At least Mom was still on my side. But with three restaurants to run, she worked dawn till dusk and had no idea how they treated me at home.

I've cried, screamed, and broken down after each breakup. Nothing changed.

Ugh, that disappointment hit me so hard, it was like my chest had a giant hole. The wind just whooshed through it, y'know? Freezing me from the inside‚Äîliterally felt like my heart turned to ice.

Dad glanced at me with disgust before sitting on the couch to watch TV like nothing happened.

I stepped directly in front of the screen, dead serious.

""Dad, just tell me the truth. Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you? What about me bothers you so much? Can't we just talk about this like normal people instead of... whatever this is?""

We're family. If there was a misunderstanding, we could just clear it up.

But Dad wouldn't even look at me, just stared coldly at the TV screen.

""I've told you. No dating. No marriage. If you disobey me, I'll kill you myself.""

Then he turned his black eyes on me, shooting me a glare.

I shuddered‚Äîmy spine turned to ice.

He wasn't joking. In the next moment, he jumped up, stormed into the kitchen, and came back with a cleaver, running at me like a maniac.

I ran to my room, locked the door, and called my best friend to get the police.

They arrived quickly, my bestie right behind them.

A female officer immediately subdued my father, knocking the knife far away. Only then did I dare come out.

""Mr. Blackwood, you're under suspicion of attempted murder. You need to come with us to the station for questioning.""

Despite being arrested, Dad looked completely unfazed. He wasn't scared at all.

My bestie saw the cut on my arm where the knife had grazed me and went pale, tears streaming down her face.

She punched my father, furious beyond words.

""What is wrong with you? That's your daughter!""

""You'd rather kill her than let her get married?""

She covered her face, sobbing uncontrollably.

I knew if the cops weren't there, she would have beaten him senseless just to make him pay for what he'd done to me.

At least someone in this world genuinely cared about my happiness.

The cops questioned my dad about why he did it, but his face stayed blank, showing no regret‚Äîlike he did nothing wrong.

Chapter 3

My bestie stood up, waving her phone around.

""I have evidence! Fiona's been through five boyfriends since she was twenty, and her dad ruined every single relationship! He even got them to hurt her with words and hits! I have all the injury photos she sent me. These monsters need to face justice!""

The moment she finished, my dad let out this creepy-ass giggle, his face twisting into something straight out of a horror movie.

He motioned for the cops to loosen their grip on his arms, then turned to my friend.

""Fine, take me in. But first, I need to grab some important evidence from my study. You can all come with me if you're worried I'll try to escape.""

My blood turned to ice in my veins.

I immediately blocked the study door, cold sweat drenching my clothes, eyes red and desperate.

""No! None of you can go in there!""

If I was right, anyone who followed my dad into that study would come out completely changed‚Äîjust like everyone else had.

Seeing how scared I was, my bestie wrapped her arm around my shoulders.

""Fiona, it's okay. The police and I are here now. Your dad can't hurt you anymore.""

She looked at me worriedly, but I wouldn't let go of the doorknob, holding it for dear life‚Äîfingers almost numb.

My eyes were total chaos‚Äîscared shitless and helpless as hell. The cops? They just stared, confused‚Äîprobably thought I was losing it.

The female officers walked over with soft, reassuring smiles, gently pulling me aside.

""It's alright, Fiona. We're just letting him get something. He can't possibly hurt you.""

I shook my head wildly, tears streaming down my face and splashing onto the floor.

""Please, you can't go in there. You just can't.""

The way I freaked out only made them more curious about what secrets the study might be hiding. I knew I'd blown it.

One officer even told me to stay put, while everyone else followed my dad inside. I couldn't stop them.

My bestie even had the nerve to mock him, saying, ""Let's see what tricks you'll pull now that you're screwed! You tried to murder your own daughter‚Äîyou're going down, no matter what!""

She was the last one to enter the study.

She even turned back, winked at me, and smiled reassuringly. With her there, everything would be fine.

I stood there like a statue, my emotions going haywire‚Äîheart pounding, hands shaking, brain total static. I couldn't move, couldn't think‚Äîjust...frozen.

Honestly, part of me prayed they had stronger willpower than the others and wouldn't be affected by whatever my dad did.

Even if they went in, my bestie's gotta be on my side, right? She definitely wouldn't ditch me.

God, I was so naive.

Through the crack in the door, I watched her expression transform from fearful to panicked, then shift entirely to rage and hostility.

She was so angry she slammed a coffee cup onto the floor.

Boom! Pieces everywhere‚ÄîI just stood there, shook.

My dad lifted his head smugly, like this was exactly what he'd expected.

When they stepped out, my friend smashed her phone onto the floor‚Äîcrash!‚Äîthen turned to the cops with a weak, sorry smile.

""I'm so sorry, officers. Mr. Blackwood was just trying to bond with his daughter. He never meant to hurt her. I completely misunderstood.""

The officers frowned, their faces darkening as they stared me down.

""Don't ever file false reports again! This is just a verbal warning, but next time you won't be so lucky!""

I collapsed to the floor like a deflated balloon.

Their complete reversal proved I'd never get help again.

My ""bestie"" dug her fingernails into my head.

""Listen up! If you hadn't lied about being murdered, I wouldn't have made a false report. You better seriously think about what you did!!""

They all gave me dirty looks before letting my dad loose and storming out.",1,1747333275.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Free full novel available! Type ‚Äòyes‚Äô below and I‚Äôll inbox you the link.","# CHAPTER ONE

25th of April, 2155 was the worst day of my life.

And I've had terrible days, in fact, a terrible life generally but today, the final nail to my metaphorical coffin would be hammered in and I couldn't do anything about it.

Why, you might be wondering; well, since the aliens came to our planet and conquered us without breaking a silly sweat, they've created the ‚ÄúSynchronization of Species‚Äù system where young girls from the ages of 18 to 20 are paired with alien men for procreation. They host this crazy event where young girls are auctioned for aliens of all levels except for the lowest ones.

You are forced to have one child and wean them before going back home, if the alien decides to keep you, then he will pay your family a huge amount of money, bigger than what you got if you were to have gone back and that's it. You'll be an alien's sex slave for the rest of your life.

So as my mom and younger sister were fussed about in the room, trying to dress me up so I won't look as horrid as I felt, all I could feel was putrid hatred for the fact that I'll be forced to lose a great part of my life and that these aliens don't even care about our opinions.

‚ÄúTess, you have to stop crying. It won't change anything and you're ruining your makeup!‚Äù My mom exclaimed, obviously stressed.

‚ÄúI'm sorry momma‚Äù I apologized and took a wipe to repair the damage.

‚ÄúYou have to look good, okay? Who knows? You might get paired with a kind one. And we do need the money, your father's surgery is very expensive so see to it as a sacrifice for the family, and once you are back, you'll get your life again. It‚Äôll be like you‚Äôve never left‚Äù She said, trying to make me or herself feel better or whatever the attempt was.

All I knew was that I won't make this easy on them. Whoever gets paired with me would regret it, I'll not go down without as much fight as possible.

‚ÄúTess, do you think that one of them would fall in love with you?‚Äù My sister, Anna said as she brought my bag that was filled with necessities and nothing extra because they were going to provide everything we needed for the whole year.

‚ÄúI hope not. Besides, I plan to be as terrifying as possible. They won't break me‚Äù I declared, giving her a fake smile. I didn't want her worrying about me in my absence. She still had a few years ahead of her and it's best spent doing things that make one happy, considering the limited resources.

‚ÄúPlease be careful, daughter. I don't want to lose you to their cruelty,‚Äù my daddy said as he wheeled himself into what will not be my room for the next foreseeable future.

I took deep breaths to steady myself, keeping the tears that were threatened to flow intact.

‚ÄúThanks Daddy. I'll be back in no time, so try to miss me a lot,‚Äù I said and hugged him.

‚ÄúLet's go, Tessa. It's better we go by ourselves than to have those horrible creatures in our house‚Äù my mom said and I nodded in agreement.

The last time they came here, I lost my brother and we've never been the same as a family ever since.

The aliens were cruel in a way that showed how much they couldn't feel, always on autopilot. They hated how humans loved and were able to make sacrifices for their loved ones.

This whole situation was because they wanted the ability to feel as well.

And once in a while, we would hear the story of some of them falling in love and there's a huge celebration by their kind. They have another event which is aired on all TV stations and we are forced to watch some of our own get paraded as a sign of progress and integration but, if you looked closer, you'd see how unhappy they really were.

From what we knew, they didn't just want to colonize us, they wanted to wipe out our existence but still maintain a part of us that was good and till date, no one knew how they were doing it.

I shook my head of the dreadful thoughts and focused on the present.

‚ÄúAnn, come here‚Äù I called to my sister who was standing at the door, crying.

She ran to me and I hugged her like my life depended on it.

‚ÄúI'll be back soon, Anna. Don't feel terrible and don't give momma any more gray hairs, okay?‚Äù I kissed her cheek and we waved at each other as I got into the beaten van we used for our family business.

Mom was an unusually fast driver because of her anxiety but today, it seemed she didn't want the car to move.

I looked at her face and I could see how much she was trying to be strong and not break down in tears. I guessed I‚Äôve never mentioned it but a lot of girls died in these events and some got sexually assaulted once they were chosen and nothing was done about it because they see us as lesser creatures. Their whole ideology is that we are tools they are using to advance their species and the concept of humanity is lost in the whole process.

So I understood Momma's hesitant driving and I refused to mention it. If she wanted me to see her only in her strong state, it's fine. She's the best I could have ever asked for and I wouldn't trade her for anything.

But when we eventually got to the venue, she couldn't hold back her tears.

‚ÄúTess, my treasure‚Äù she cried, hugging me tightly like she was scared that if she let go, I'll combust.

‚ÄúMomma, don't worry. I'll be fine and I'll be back very soon‚Äù I assured her even though I wasn't sure of that.

‚ÄúMake sure you do, my child. Don't let the system swallow or change you and don't fall in love with our enemies. You must survive and come back to your mother, you hear me?‚Äù She said and I nodded before coming down from the car.

‚ÄúHey! Move that crap away from the road, bitch!‚Äù an alien hybrid shouted.

Now, there were classes of our captors based on how much alien versus human a person had.

Once the children that were born reached the age of 18, they were tested and placed into different categories.

The very alien ones with human emotions were superior, the perfect mix were normal citizens with special privileges like a consistent job and have access to some luxurious places and the last were considered failed experiments, like this one, currently screaming his frustrated lungs at my mother who was parked in the parking lot left for humans. We'd have to walk a long way into the building because of this.

I guess the parking lot for the failed experiments was filled up and he thought he could come parked here but we were in a spot reserved for us and I wasn't going to stand for him screaming at my mother like that so I replied to him.

‚ÄúIf you are done screaming your frustrated lungs out, you'll take that crap away from there‚Äù

‚ÄúWho do you think you're talking to? Tell your bitch of a mother to take that contraption away from there, I have a right to it more than you do!‚Äù He shouted, his throat which was shoved out of the window popping out veins.

‚ÄúAt least, I have a mother. Where's yours?‚Äù And that did piss him off.

My mom came down from the car, shaking her head and I did the same but before we could walk towards each other, I heard tires screeching and the sound of cars hitting each other made us scream.

The guts of this guy to hit our van because of a temper tantrum.

Luckily for us, a superior was walking out of the main entrance and saw the whole thing.

He whistled and we all focused our attention and I was fuming.

‚ÄúWhat seems to be the problem, XYZ?‚Äù He called, referring to the guy‚Äôs lower status which was pretty normal but I guessed in this situation, it reminded the guy of who he was and it made his green face darken.

‚ÄúThey wouldn't leave the space for me to park, Master,‚Äù he said, bowing his head.

‚ÄúBut it's their parking lot, or have you suddenly gone up in the rank?‚Äù He asked, coming closer to us.

‚ÄúOf course not Sir, I'm still your lowly servant. I just thought since they were on the bottom of the food chain, I was higher than them,‚Äù he exclaimed, trying to defend his actions but I was boiling.

‚ÄúDude, you are literally a failed experiment. The rest of us have more use than you do‚Äù I shouted at him even though I hated that fact. At least, they could live normal lives if they stopped acting so hateful.

'Tess, calm down!‚Äô my Momma shushed me. She hated attracting attention so I went back to her to avoid getting the superior alien pissed. I guessed he was already angry at me but they could rot in hell for all I care. I just didn't want my Momma getting hurt in any way.

‚ÄúHumans, I'm sure you are here for the SOS event so I won't keep you much longer. Go on in and when you get back, Madam, head home. Your car will be delivered to your business place in good condition tomorrow morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you want her to walk home?‚Äù I asked, alarming at his suggestion.

‚ÄúTess! Please ignore her, My Lord. I'll hitch a ride with someone. Now, young lady, come, let's go. We're already late.‚Äù She replied and dragged me into the humongous building where they‚Äô‚Äôd take our humanity and gave it to children we will never raise or know.

**CHAPTER TWO**

Momma dragged me into the building and one thing I could ascribe to these aliens was their architectural advancement. This place was huge but it didn't appear vague. Everything was intricately designed with beauty and functionality in mind, not sparing any dime. The entrance was a big hall where several girls were being scanned and sent into different rooms and the moment I sighted her beautiful locs, I rushed to meet her. Rosa, my best friend who was as disgusted with this whole process as I was, had streaks of dried tears on her face.

‚ÄúRoe, what's wrong?‚Äù I asked, ignoring the weird looks from everyone.

The moment she noticed it was me, she hugged me tightly and began a fresh batch of tears.

‚ÄúTess, they are so cruel! How are we supposed to live with these for a year? Three aliens have talked down on me because I'm black and no one can even do anything about it. It's frustrating and I wish I could join the revolution but my mom would die of a heart attack‚Äù she poured out and my heart broke for her.

When the aliens came, they took all of our societal problems and magnified it a hundred times. The gender wars, racism, economic classism and so many horrid ideologies became their way of grading us. They didn't have any of that where they were coming from and decided to adapt the stronger side of the debate, thus we find ourselves in conditions like this.

‚ÄúRoe, trust me. We'll survive this. You just need to toughen up, don't let them think you're weak, okay? In two years max, we'll be out of here and we'll open that coffee shop with a library with what we've been saving up for since we were seven, okay?‚Äù I assured her and before she could reply to me, I heard a jarring sound coming from the speakers before an alien delivered an announcement.

Their voices always separated them from the rest of us. The original aliens. They looked scary but they were the ones making all the decisions on our planet and no one knew till date how they conquered us, especially with all the nuclear warheads we possessed.

‚ÄúAll parents and guardians, leave the premises immediately as the preparation for the auction is about to begin!‚Äù the female alien screamed.

There were quite a few females in their original number and they were given very high positions in their society. They just didn't like human women so much with the way they treated us like cattle.

With the announcement, everyone began hugging their daughters and I sought my Momma‚Äôs hug as this would be the last time I'll see her for the next one to two years. I hated how much I found it hard to cry as my chest was filled with emotions but no way to let it out.

Regardless, I hugged her tightly and as she cried, she said a prayer for me and I allowed her this time. If she found succor in it, I wouldn't stop her.

‚ÄúPlease stay safe, avoid any unnecessary altercations, Tess. Please come back to us, okay? Your father and I love you so much. Your sister needs you as well, please,‚Äù she murmured to me, tears falling from her eyes with each word.

‚ÄúMomma, I'm going to come back okay, you don't need to be scared. Take care of Anna and don't worry, it's just a Christmas or two and I'll be back. Think of it as me going to the college you used to tell me about, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, my precious daughter.‚Äù She hugged me again before the XYZ aliens used to enforce order began pouring out of different doors in the hall and everyone knew they had to bail or be forced out and trust me, you didn't want those frustrated assholes manhandling your parent so I gave Momma a little push so she could quickly leave.

We stood together, Rosa and I, her head on my shoulder as they gave us numbers and told us which rooms to go in to be ‚Äúprepared‚Äù for the bidding. I didn't really know what that entailed but I guessed we were going to be primed and dolled up for the aliens to choose us.

These XYZ‚Äôs depended on the success of each SOS event to be able to feed properly. It was the biggest event of the world and each locality had the center where it was held so a few hundreds of them would be employed for different purposes.

For example, the guy wearing a suit that was two sizes bigger than him was a TV host in his daily life with a meager salary but this event gave him the opportunity to earn big from the bidding money, so he was obviously putting in all his energy and sweating in a room filled with air conditioners.

‚ÄúEveryone on this line, head to room, one! This line, room two! ‚Ä¶‚Äù And so on.

‚ÄúRoe, stay at my back so we can be sent to the same room, okay?‚Äù I told Rosa and she nodded. I could sense the fear in her body as the thought of being alone with these people crossed our minds.

All through our childhood, we only viewed them from afar, our parents taking the brunt of their cruelty. Most rich families were suddenly only able to feed by working many odd jobs and everyone became a businessman but then, who was buying?

Only agriculture could give you a little bit of stable income and that was left to black people for whatever reason. I hated how they structured our world and blamed us for it. Each time some group of people gathered the courage to complain about something, they always got the same reply.

‚ÄúWe met you this way and are only trying to give you a better version of your world so keep quiet‚Äù

The revolution Rosa spoke about was very unsuccessful because they could never agree on one thing. Sometimes, they are popular and in the next minute, everyone hates them for one reason or the other so I guessed we were all a mess of confusion and they took advantage of that to control us. Our differences gave them a loophole and they were treating us like inanimate objects.

When it was our turn, we went down the hall on the right and entered the room meant for us which was just an entrance into a larger area. There were doors all over the place and I wondered what it was.

A couple of makeup artists were arranging their equipment and so many other XYZ‚Äôs were running around to get one thing or the other done. In shorter terms, the whole place was a mess.

But once they saw us all standing like confused chickens, they got their act together a little bit.

‚ÄúWhy are you all staring like you've seen a ghost? Pick a bag there and go to the bathroom. Bathe and wear your clothes, then come down here for your makeup. Pick up your pace, people! We don't have all day!‚Äù one of them, his tail swishing as he brought out things from the big bag shouted at us and the fear in his voice sent us all into a frenzy.

I picked a bag as Roe did the same and we went down the hall into separate bathrooms.",1,1747333258.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

""There will be a twenty percent reduction in staff,"" my manager Craig announced to the group in our emergency staff meeting.

My stomach immediately turned into nervous knots.

Craig paused, waiting for the collective gasp to settle down, a small smile quivering at the corners of his mouth.

Is that sympathy, or is he enjoying this? I wondered.

As if to address my thoughts, Craig's face switched to a mask of regret as he looked around the room.

""I'm not happy about it either. Each of you is important to this department in my opinion. But, since the new CEO believes differently, I'll be conducting performance reviews with everyone this week and reporting my findings.""

My heart sank.

I knew my work was good. But if it was going to be a popularity contest, I had no chance.

After all, I am ‚Äúscentless‚Äù.

In a world of werewolves, scent was just as vital a sense as sight.

Werewolves had a built-in system to rate every scent they encountered. Alphas were born with B grade scent minimums. Betas and Omegas, on the other hand, could be very flexible. They could easily smell like a C, D, or F grade to strangers.

Whenever one met someone who had the potential to be a best friend or partner, they will immediately register as an A, while A+ is definitely a top match. There was a myth about S grade, but it was only a myth.

Therefore, best friends, couples, business partners, even military units, all these social ties were established on scents.

I, however, had no scent. Or at least, that's what most people said.

Another oddity was that it seemed I lacked the system to grade other people‚Äôs scent. I didn't instinctively rate someone before I knew them, but instead judged people on other aspects like personality or behavior.

Those who were being kind compared me to air. Some openly asked about my bloodline, another thing usually discernable in one's personal smell. My answer was again disappointing. I was an orphan and had no idea who my parents were.

""I'll be sending each of you messages about when we are to meet. Thank you, and again, I'm very sorry that we are in this situation,"" Craig finished this meeting.

My colleagues began to murmur to each other as they walked out, but no one cared about me.

I was used to it by now. They didn't mean to be rude.

I went out into the hall and began to walk toward the main room and my cubicle, but Craig came striding back down the corridor and blocked my way.

""There you are, Elena,"" he said, beaming. ""You're always so hard to track down, you know."" He tapped his nose and gave me a wink.

I tried not to roll my eyes.

Performance evaluation, I thought and smiled.

""What's up, Craig?""

He handed me a stack of files. ""Some new manuscripts just in.""

His hand went up to my face, bringing his scent of licorice with it. He flicked a lock of my dark hair away before settling his hand on my shoulder.

I wanted to brush it off but I forced myself to be still, to keep my smile. I looked around. There was no one else in the corridor.

""How are you feeling after the announcement?"" he asked.

""Nervous,"" I admitted. His scent was too close and it made me nauseous.

I turned my nose away, but he didn't move his hand.

""Just do your best. Speaking of, those need to be in my inbox by the time you leave, okay?""

""Okay.""

He rubbed my shoulder and continued down the corridor.

I watched him go, trying not to gag at the thick sweetness that drifted in his wake. I used to be okay with the smell of licorice until I got to know Craig.

I'd seen him squeeze, hug, and pat other females and no one seemed to give it a second thought. Jerry in marketing even patted him back.

Am I being oversensitive? I thought, trying to wipe the licorice smell off my shoulder and glancing at the females around me as I went past their cubicles. No one else seemed to have a problem with his handsy behavior.

I sat down at my desk and stared at the folders.

I'd wanted to be a reporter. It's what they promised when I first came to the newspaper after graduation. But here I was, years later, still on comics and proofreading, having done nothing more than occasionally write stories for other reporters under their byline.

I guess it was hard for them to trust someone without a scent.

And yet I tried hard to do well in every work I was given.

Surely, I thought, all that good work and so little complaining will allow me to keep my job.

A few hours later, the atmosphere began to change. It was Friday, and people were busy planning to meet for drinks and dinner.

I went to the manager's office with my proofed copies and was relieved to see Craig had gone for the day. I slapped the packet in his inbox, glancing at the photo of his wife on his desk before I went to pack my bag.

I pushed open the doors to the front of the building just as my phone dinged with a text.

It was Cathy, my only close friend and sole support since high school.

Guess what? Your high school crush is in town.

The line was followed by a spray of winking and heart-surrounded emoji faces.

My breath caught in my throat and I instinctively turned right, heading toward a popular square.

Music and voices from Friday night crowds filled the air and neon lights illuminated the space. Delicious smells of meat and fried food from the restaurants swirled around the people happily hanging out or on their way to food and entertainment.

An enormous screen across the square projected the local news.

And there he was.

Charles.

Larger than life, being interviewed by a local reporter, he was breathtakingly handsome with his dark, wavy hair and sharp blue eyes. His face light up the screen.

The reporter beamed and leaned in toward him. He'd always that effect on people.

Their dialog ran across the bottom.

""And a hearty welcome to the young media entrepreneur, Mr. Charles Rafe!"" the reporter said.

""Thank you, Sandy.""

He smiled at her, and I suddenly remembered him, a little more baby-faced, on the soccer field or in the school baseball uniform, in the back row of my history class, but still attracting every eye in the room when he smiled like that.

Even now I could feel myself grinning at the screen like an idiot, remembering his warm, vetiver smell.

""And what are your plans for our fair city?"" the reporter asked.

""As you know, Sandy, the merger of my family's two companies has been a good move. We're fortunately seeing steady profits.""

""We all know fortune has nothing to do with it,"" the reporter said, playfully nudging his arm.

""Well, thank you, but it takes a hardworking, loyal set of people to make any business successful.""

His blue eyes looked directly into the camera.

I caught my breath, as did a few other people who had also stopped and looked up. He seemed to be looking down through the square directly at me. I stood, riveted to the spot, gazing back.

""So naturally I'm here to find those people, and while I'm at it, acquire some companies and expand the Rafe family's business empire.""

I couldn‚Äôt help but stare at the screen until Charles was gone.

Wouldn't it be weird if he were my new boss? I thought.

I quickly shook my head with a bitter smile.

It was a big city.

Surely there was more than one large conglomerate coming to town. 

**Chapter 2**

It was true what Cathy had said. Charles was my high school crush.

But it was also true that it was so much more than that.Years had passed since high school, but the feelings I had during that period of my life were as strong as if they'd happened yesterday.

Back then, no one in my high school didn‚Äôt like Charles Rafe. He was the only student, except Cathy, that would smile to me and say hi. He even said my name correctly every time.

Gradually, he became the reason I got out of bed and went to class in the morning, just so I could sit silently behind him. His casual smile was the factor that made or broke my day.

There was no way he would remember me even if he was my new boss. Still, the idea of it made me smile into the night sky and wait for the screen to loop the interview so I could see his face one more time.

I gazed up at the screen, watching the commercials tick by.

The programs usually looped at least a half-dozen times before they moved on to the next thing, giving people time to see it as they walked through city squares.

I waited and was rewarded.

There he was again.

His sharp blue eyes took me out of the city square and suddenly I was back in Mr. Sellers' senior English honors class. I sat in the back left corner seat trying not to be noticed and at the same time trying to absorb every bit of knowledge I could.

I loved that class because that is where I started my dream of becoming a journalist one day.

Charles and his numerous Alpha friends sat in the rows in front of me, laughing, smiling, and always having a good time.

Mr. Sellers enjoyed their cheerful presence in class, and they acted like a wall of sunshine between him and my hungry mind. Not that I minded.

Sitting behind Charles was heaven. Every time he moved his vetiver scent wafted toward me, and I often bent forward over a paper pretending to write just to be nearer to him.

There was also a moment I treasured when he would saunter in moments before the starting bell. Because he was kind, he would greet people on his way to his seat, and this included me.

He'd make eye contact with his piercing blue eyes, and we'd both smile.

""Hey, Elena.""

""Hi.""

And then he'd sit, his back turned, and that was it. But for me, it was enough to make my day. If we got to write a paper in class, the day was even better.

It was high school graduation before I got the courage to say more than a few words. I watched him walk across the stage, his diploma held high in triumph for the cheers from both the audience and the seated students, and was sure I wouldn't see him again.

That knowledge gave me courage.

When I saw him walk toward his car alone after telling his friends he'd see them later at a party, I went that direction, too.

He paused to unlock the door. As I passed, I said, ""Congratulations, Charles.""

He looked up, smiling.

""I thought I noticed you coming, Elena. Congratulations to you, too.""

I was surprised. He noticed me coming? Those words were reserved for those with discernable scents. For a moment we looked at each other, me stunned by his intense gaze.

""I...""

He looked at me with a small smile, patient and waiting. I forced the words out of my mouth.

""I was wondering, I know you have a ton of friends and things to do, but would you maybe like to have coffee with me or something? Next week? Or sometime.""

My words seemed to hang in the air and I felt my blood began to pound. I felt my face twist in agony, knowing I'd just made a fool of myself.

His smile faded a little. I wished I could look away and sink into the ground but his blue eyes held mine.

""I'm sorry, Elena,"" he said. He looked intensely at me, as if wanting me to understand something he wasn't saying.

I nodded, feeling my face flaming red.

""I totally understand. Well, good luck, and all that.""

""Wait, Elena.""

But I hadn't. I'd walked off in a blur of humiliation.

What was I thinking? I'd raged at myself.

Obviously, he wouldn't have said yes. We were so far apart that we might have been different species.

The memory of my humiliation made me groan even now, years later standing in a busy city square on a Friday night.

At least I'd tried. Thinking back, I'd have regretted not doing it despite the embarrassment.

I pulled out my phone as his interview started again and held it aloft toward his face, filming him. When the clip finished, I sent it to Cathy who texted back as I was walking away.

Still in love?

Of course not. Just a distant fangirl now.

You never know! She followed this with a winky face emoji. How about dinner this weekend? It's been a while.

My heart warmed. Cathy was the most wonderful friend, though I never was able to shake the suspicion that she just felt bad for me.

When we were younger, she used to give me hugs and bury her nose in my hair and inhale. ""You smell so good. Solid A to me. Why can nobody else sense it?‚Äù ""

I'd squeezed her back, feeling her refreshing lily scent surrounding me. ""What do I smell like?""

""I can't place it. But it's gorgeous.""

I'd always assumed this was a joke to cheer me up. She had always been there for me, jokes or not, and I regretted having to turn her down for dinner.

I'm sorry. I have to save my job.

She sent a frowning face but then a gif of unicorns dancing together. Okay, babe. Don't work too hard. Remember I love you.

Love you, too, I texted back, and smiled. I was so lucky.

I spent the rest of the weekend hardly moving from my desk or changing out of my pajamas while I combed through every project and noted every accolade.

By the time Craig's scheduling link came through on Sunday night I was ready. I confidently scheduled the block mid-morning and went to bed knowing I'd done everything I could.

Despite knowing my looks made little difference, I took special care with my hair and outfit that morning. I wanted to look as deserving as my portfolio suggested. I even felt decent as I sat down five minutes before the scheduled time outside Craig's office.

Laughter and casual discussion came from behind his closed door. I checked my watch, my stomach clenching.

This wasn't good. My portfolio was good. I was valuable and I knew it. But if it came down to this type of banter I was in trouble.

The minutes ticked by and my appointment came and went. Five minutes, ten minutes. I could feel my muscles tensing and a headache coming on.

Finally, the door opened and a colleague walked by calling back, ""Okay, see you, Craig.""

I stood and turned, looking at Craig who was leaning on the doorframe.

""Elena! Wonderful. Come on in."" He waved to a corner of the couch and I sat. He sat across from me in a chair and put his elbows on his knees. ""Okay, Elena. Let's see what you've got.""

I sat up straight and put my portfolio on my knees where it seemed his gaze was fixed. I crossed my legs self-consciously, and began to talk. I sounded confident, competent.

I handed him a reference sheet with lists of successes and awards I'd been responsible for helping come about. He took the sheet and barely glanced at it, his eyes never leaving my bare knees.

When I'd finished there was a short pause.

""Do you have any questions?"" I asked, nervous for the first time and shifting my legs to cross the other direction.

His eyes flickered up at me for the first time in the ten minutes I'd been talking. Then he stood and stretched, his paunch peeking out slightly from under his shirt.

He sat down on the couch and draped an arm over the couch behind me. He leaned closer.

I tried not to breathe in his licorice scent.

""I do have a question for you, Elena, but it's not really about your portfolio.""

I felt my stomach drop. This couldn't be good.",1,1747333096.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False
1knfb1y,https://i.redd.it/utwlm96emz0f1.jpeg,ZP6 vs C40 - How to simulate C40 cups with ZP6? ZP6 a good choice for Brazilian beans? Return ZP6?,"
This week I pulled the trigger on a ZP6, after a lot of stress comparing it to the Comandante C40 (and other similar grinders like Kingrinder K6 and 1Zpresso K-Max).

I love tea-like cups, light roasts, florals/fruity notes and acidity, and I hate bitter and strong coffee. So that‚Äôs what drew me to the ZP6.

However, while I‚Äôm very excited to test the ZP6, I‚Äôm still overthinking and anxious about having made a bad decision. And here is why.

My problem: 
- I live in Brazil. 
- Truly light roasts are rare, most roasters lean medium to dark. 
- Floral or fruity beans are hard to find here due to import restrictions, so Im limited to Brazilian beans and local roasters. 
- Even only buying the most exotic local options, the brighter notes are often mild and hidden behind the typical Brazilian profile: low acidity, chocolate/nut/caramel notes, heavier body. 
- I‚Äôm hoping the ZP6 will help bring these brighter, acidic notes that has been hard to achieve with my current Kingrinder K2. And I guess Im right. But I‚Äôm also worried. 
- One issue is since the ZP6 is more suited to brighter beans (african, colombian etc) and light roast, I probably wont extract this grinder‚Äôs best potential. 
- Another issue is I also wont extract the best these brazilian beans has to offer (which is the darker, sweeter notes Im trying to divert from). 
- Also, there arent many great roasters in Brazil, so Im worried the ZP6 won‚Äôt be as forgiving as the C40, which is said to smooth out flaws and to work better with all kinds of bean styles and roast profiles (contrasting with the ZP6 more limited usability, if my researches are correct).
- People say C40 provides more complexity, which Id be happy trading off for clearer, juicier and more floral/fruity cups. But since there aren‚Äôt many floral/acidic notes in Brazilian coffees to begin with, and the ZP6 will provide less body/sweetness/complexity, Im worried I will end up with even more boring cups. 

So all things consideres, I guess probably the C40 (or a similar grinder) would‚Äôve been the better match for my reality, since it favors notes that are common in Brazilian beans. Right? Am I forcing the wrong tool into the wrong context? Should I return the ZP6, lean into the Brazilian profile and pick a grinder that works with it rather than against it?

Either way, the ZP6 is on its way. So I researched how to ‚Äúnudge‚Äù it toward a more C40-like cup. Just in case. And Id love your input in all of this.

**This is what Ive researched on how to make ZP6 cups more like C40:**
- Use hotter water (92‚Äì94¬∞C) to boost extraction and body
- Grind slightly finer
- Bloom longer (45s‚Äì2min) for even extraction
- Pulse pour with pauses to allow layering and body development
- Use slightly higher doses (15.5‚Äì16g instead of 15g)
- Mix 80% coarse + 20% fine grind for extra depth

Anyone with experience here, would love to hear your thoughts. 

Am I off with any of the info above? Was it a mistake to pick the ZP6 considering my context? Will I be able to extract C40-like cups with the tweaks above? Any tips?

1knfaau,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1knfaau/i_think_my_cousin_used_her_husband_as_a/,I think my cousin used her husband as a rebound‚Äîand now regrets marrying him.,"I have this cousin (25F)‚Äîeldest on my mom‚Äôs side‚Äîwho recently got married and had a baby. Her little brother is only 9, so medyo nagsisimula ulit yung parents nila kasi grade 6 pa lang siya. Meanwhile, my cousin lives separately na, and has a 4-month-old baby with her husband. They've been married for about a year, and were only together for 2 years before that.

Here‚Äôs the thing: before this guy, she was in a relationship with someone else for 6 or 7 years. Breadwinner yung ex, and to be honest, parang andaming pinaglaban ni kuya para sa kaniya. He literally begged for her in front of her parents, kneeled and everything. But her response? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with him.‚Äù No emotion. Nothing.

We even had coffee once and I could sense she was stressed, so I went with her to the mall just to hang out. When we got home, guess what? Her ex was standing outside their house. Nakasuit. May dala pang guitar and roses. Hinaharana siya. She looked at me and said, ‚ÄúPaano ko ba mapapaalis ‚Äòto,‚Äù with a disgusted tone. That‚Äôs when I knew‚Äîwala na talaga siyang feelings.

But here‚Äôs the twist: that same day, over coffee, she told me she was talking to someone new. A coach from STI, may kotse daw, flight attendant nanay. This was just weeks after her breakup with the long-term ex. I didn‚Äôt say anything, but something felt off. It was too fast.

Fast forward‚Äîshe starts dating this new guy seriously, eventually becomes official with him. But here‚Äôs where it gets weird. She stalks her ex‚Äôs FB using her mom‚Äôs account. Later I find out she also used our younger cousin‚Äôs FB to stalk him too. Every time we‚Äôd talk, lagi siyang may chika about her ex‚Äîwhat he posted, who he‚Äôs with, etc. Like, girl, moved on ka nga ba talaga?

Then we had a fight over something petty (a charger lol) and I moved out of her place. Haven‚Äôt spoken to her since. But I still hear things from family. Like how she told her husband one day, out of nowhere, ‚ÄúI regret marrying you.‚Äù He was devastated. Told her mom about it. When asked why she said it, she just said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

She doesn‚Äôt let him attend family gatherings. Kapag may okasyon, laging may palusot na may laro si hubby. Turns out, siya pala yung ayaw isama. And the biggest red flag? During the pamamanhikan, si lalaki lang yung nandun. Wala yung parents niya. Their families only met for the first time on the wedding day itself.

Now she doesn‚Äôt want her husband to hold the baby. Gets mad at him when he tries. Her explanation? Postpartum. But even now, she brings up their past fights constantly, and she seems cold to him.

Honestly? I think she married him for all the wrong reasons. Used him as a rebound, a way to prove something, maybe to feel secure or upgrade her image. But now that the dust has settled, I don‚Äôt think she actually loves him. And I don‚Äôt know how long she can keep pretending.

And even though we had a fight, I still hope she makes a decision‚Äîa real one‚Äîas early as she can. Because if she is just pretending, if she‚Äôs really just forcing herself to prove something or make her ex feel like she ""upgraded"" and that he wasn‚Äôt worth it, then I hope she lets that go. Only she knows the truth, and if she‚Äôs just holding on out of pride or spite, I hope she frees herself from that weight. No one deserves to live in a lie, especially not with a baby in the picture.

1knf9df,https://www.reddit.com/r/onionheadlines/comments/1knf9df/trump_signs_eo_decriminalizing_sexual_assault/,Trump Signs EO Decriminalizing Sexual Assault Except For Immigrants,"WASHINGTON‚ÄîAt a press conference held in the Oval Office on Thursday, president Donald Trump signed an executive order decriminalizing sexual assault unless the perpetrator is an immigrant residing in the country whether legally or illegally. 

The president told reporters, ‚ÄúSexual assault is a myth dreamed up by women who are mad at their husbands or boyfriends or just want attention, and everybody knows it. Normally it would take me forever to pardon so-called rapists one by one. But with this new law, I only have to sign one thing. Now I can get to Mar-A-Lago faster to play golf with people who are investing millions in my meme coins. You know, you should really start buying before the price skyrockets. Supplies are limited, so call now. Operators are standing by.‚Äù

When asked by a reporter why an exception was made for immigrants, Trump responded, ‚ÄúWithout the exception, it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense for me to say, ‚ÄòSuch and such immigrant was deported because he is a known rapist.‚Äô‚Äù

Adherents of the Maga movement, in particular females, cheered the new executive order which allows their favorite conservative figures convicted of sexual assault to walk free. The president‚Äôs online merchandise store immediately sold out of the new ‚ÄúSorry, Libs! Trump Is *Not* A Sexual Predator Anymore!‚Äù line of merchandise featuring a doctored image of a leering and shirtless, muscle-bound Trump. The line is sold on items including T-shirts, bumper stickers, pink or red hats and coffee mugs. 

The executive order also includes a posthumous pardon for Jeffrey Epstein as well as a budget of $100 million to build a park in his honor. The greenspace will include a statue of the child sex offender, a lake and several miles of densely wooded trails.",14,1747332977.0,onionheadlines,4,0.86,False
1knf9a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpTariffNews/comments/1knf9a9/walmart_to_raise_prices_in_response_to_trump/,Walmart to raise prices in response to Trump tariffs,"BENTONVILLE, Ark. ‚Äî Walmart has confirmed it will raise prices on a range of products starting later this month, driven by rising costs from U.S. tariffs on imports from China, Latin America, and other trade partners. The retail giant says it can no longer fully absorb the impact of President Trump‚Äôs tariff policy, which continues to disrupt global supply chains and pressure retail margins.

‚ÄúWe will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren‚Äôt able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,‚Äù Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a call with investors Thursday. ‚ÄúThe higher tariffs will result in higher prices,‚Äù he added.

CFO John David Rainey¬†said in an interview with¬†[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html?ref=massmarketretailers.com)¬†that tariffs are ‚Äústill too high,‚Äù despite an announced agreement with China on lower import duties. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than any supplier can absorb. And so I‚Äôm concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You‚Äôll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.‚Äù

Categories most affected include toys, electronics, and select grocery items such as bananas, avocados, and coffee. Tariffs on imports from China, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia are hitting these categories.

Despite the challenges, Walmart reported 4.5% U.S. same-store sales growth and its first profitable ecommerce quarter. The company attracted more shoppers across income levels, especially higher-income households, a trend that accelerated during prior periods of inflation.

Walmart‚Äôs scale and diversified supplier network provide a strategic advantage over smaller competitors. However, the retailer is signaling that price increases across the sector are now inevitable. Retail analysts warn that Walmart‚Äôs decision could trigger a broader wave of inflation throughout the industry.

‚ÄúIf Walmart‚Äôs coming out ‚Äî¬†with its scale and its buying power and its focus ‚Äî and saying prices are going to rise, everyone else is going to have to follow suit,‚Äù said Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy GlobalData to¬†[NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walmarts-tariff-price-hikes-are-likely-weeks-away-rcna206837?ref=massmarketretailers.com). ‚ÄúWalmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases.‚Äù

Last month, the CEOs of Walmart, Target, and Home Depot met privately with President Trump to share concerns over trade policy. The executives warned that steep tariffs are already disrupting operations and creating uncertainty in supply planning.

Walmart‚Äôs team says it is exploring ways to mitigate the impact, including substituting tariff-affected materials and consolidating supplier relationships, but noted that not all costs can be avoided. The retailer did not issue profit guidance for Q2, citing the ‚Äúexceedingly wide range of near-term outcomes.‚Äù

With Walmart raising prices, other big-box retailers like Target, BJ‚Äôs, and Lowe‚Äôs are expected to feel similar cost pressures heading into summer.

# Key Takeaways:

* Walmart will increase prices starting in late May due to high U.S. tariffs.
* Toys, electronics, and groceries are the most impacted categories.
* The company cited unprecedented inflationary pressure from tariffs on China and Latin America.
* Despite strong earnings, Walmart withheld Q2 profit guidance.
* Analysts expect industry-wide price hikes to follow.",12,1747332971.0,TrumpTariffNews,2,0.94,False

Last year my apartment in Dallas was inundated with gnats from the middle of April until Nov. Pest control came out so many times. My neighbors had some, but not to the same extent. It just picked up again a few days ago. Here‚Äôs what we did last year and now: The apartment was bombed (lasted maybe 24 hours), I still have multiple light traps up, I still have ACV traps out, my drains have been plugged at all times when not in use since last summer, drain cleaners were used, boiling water poured down the drains, they checked for AC leaks, fridge leaks, garbage disposal, pipe leaks, fridge drain pain (there were some dead ones in the fridge). I don‚Äôt keep any open food out and definitely no produce. No plants. I keep my apartment cold and use a dehumidifier. I use a disposal cleaner 3x a week and take my trash out every night. I‚Äôve tried diatomaceous earth on the mulch outside my patio, and last year used lavender oil around the perimeter of my patio, along with my window frames and door frames. The back door is virtually never opened. I also use draft extruders. I am doing EVERYTHING possible to get rid of them and it‚Äôs not working. They‚Äôre in my face when I‚Äôm working, on my coffee table, they even land on me when I‚Äôm sitting on the couch.  What else can I do? How can I find out where they‚Äôre coming from?

Then I realized I was getting swollen every day and I looked up the brand jovial because I was using their chickpeas on a regular basis, well it turns out they have wheat present in their facility too so I had to give that up. Honestly I can keep going but it's depressing and I'm so tired of being swollen from food that shouldn't get me sick and it's so hard to find things that are actually safe and I've never felt so fucking defeated. I've had celiac for 12 years and whenever I eat purely whole plant based (I'm vegan) and zero processed I am healthy again but it's so upsetting that nuts, beans and plant based milks all have wheat present in facilities. It's driving me insane and I can't keep eliminating everything I'm so sad. This auto immune disease is so hard sometimes and it's this invisible disease that people can't see or understand and I feel like a fucking hypochondriac when I share with people who don't understand being gluten free or celiac. I'm honestly just fucking sad. ",5,1747332892.0,Celiac,2,1.0,False
