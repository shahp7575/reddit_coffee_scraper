1r1ruxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1r1ruxc/yesterday_was_my_22nb_birthday_and_my_boyfirend/,Yesterday was my (22NB) birthday and my boyfirend (24M) of 3 years made me (unintentionally) cry,"For context, it was tuesday, I had already made my mind about the fact that it was going to be a shitty day, because 1, It's tuesday, 2, I have college from 1 to 8, which means most of the time that malls are open in my city. Also the time when he works, but he took the day off.

I decided to wake up at 7am to go to all of these places in the area with him where you can get free stuff. I got 7 donuts (half I gave to him because he likes them and I don't mind sharing) and a coffee. I went to the mall with my boyfriend and we went to like 5+ places in which we couldn't get free stuff unless we had an app for like a month beforehand. I was a bit down because I missed a lot of them, but otherwise was fine. 

  
BF said, well, we're already here, let's make the most of it. So I suggested we go to the movies, since for the whole month we could have a cool combo for a cheap price (we're both college students) and he just wasn't feeling it, I know it is MY birthday, but I wasn;'t about to make a guy feel bored for two hours out of my own self interest. Instead he said he was hungry. Mind you I dislike going to restaurants because I hate waiting for food, he knows this. I explicitly said a few days before, hey, I know you want a fancy dinner, we can do that on Valentine's or your birthday, but honestly I don't want that. 

  
But bae was hungry so there we go. I'm not a people pleaser. But I wasn't entirely unconfortable with the idea of going out, and I didn;'t have breakfast either. I didn't have a better plan and I wanted to show appreciation of everything he had done for me earlier, he suggested X place, I asked, 'you sure? they take a lot of time there, it's packed today because there's a promo going on"" He said sure. Last time I went with some friends we were there for 3 hours. He had to wake up early and wanted food from there but I said fine. 

Fastforward, we're on a waiting list for an hour only to wait another 45 minutes inside once we ordered and still no food. He get's anxious, starts complaining about how it's full of people, and how they're taking so long, I told him the sushi I ordered last time (the cheapest on menu) wasn't too filling (I have an enormous appetite) And he got angry at the fact that I just didn't tell him it was a shitty place. There were 30+ tables/reservations before us, so I thought It was obvious that we were going to be a long time in there. But he started blaming me for the fact that i ""Knew"" it was a ""shitty place"". 

I told him, look, we already waited, there's no other place open, we can't do anything about the time so let's enjoy it now that we're here, and he sat there complaining for 20+ minutes and I sat there listening. I wasn't having it great either, it was my birthday, I was in the same situation as him, and I told him so. He suggested we go to another place that was going to close in 30 minutes, and I asked him to drop it and stop complaining. Because seeing him complain about something he can't change not only pissed me off but made me feel shitty about a situation we BOTH created, as though it was only my fault. He didn't, I don't remember what he said next, but at that point I just didn't want to listen to him talk about the same 3 things so I just said ""let's leave"" and started crying. Mind you this was around 40 minutes in the restaurant, after the 1 hour wait.

  
He started asking me what's wrong and trying to make me look at him, but I just didn't want to beacuse I'd cry harder, so I just stood up with him and left. I went outside, he said he didn't understand (refering to why I wanted to go outside and not make a bigger scene in the restaurant), and I just told him to stop talking about something that's already done. In the end I calmed down still feeling shitty after coming home but he kept beating himself up about how he ""ruined my birthday"" -and how he can't ever give me a present because I don't have passion for anything and don't like materialistic things (??? who complains about that??) -which he didn't do, he took a day off to get to spend a bit of time with me, which I appreciated and told him about. 

  
I'm not all perfect either but I pay close attention to what he likes and makes it possible on his birthday/special occasion no matter what.  And I don't expect him to do the same but at least don't make me cry bro.

  
TL;DR: bf and I went around in the morning for freebies, went to college, came back to go to a restaurant (which I didn't want to do) that I told him had a too long waitlist, and he gets stressed because (o surprise) the waitlists are LONG. Gets stressed out and complains for 40 mins (I tell him to stop multiple times) until he makes me cry and when we leave he beats himself up, leaving ME to comfort HIM for making me cry on my birthday.

1r1rtv3,https://i.redd.it/ughte16rrtig1.png,I tried the “pink salt + lemon water” morning drink for 14 days — here’s what actually happened,"I run a small food blog called **Tasty Billions**, and this “pink salt lemon water” thing kept trending in my comments and emails,  so I decided to test it myself for 2 weeks instead of just writing about it blindly.

What I used each morning:

* 1 cup warm water
* Small pinch Himalayan pink salt
* Juice of ½ lemon
* 1 tsp raw honey (optional)

Drank it on an empty stomach before coffee.

Here’s what actually happened:

• Helped with hydration first thing in the morning  
• Reduced bloating on some days  
• Made me delay breakfast slightly  
• No dramatic fat loss (calorie deficit still matters)

My honest take:  
It’s not a “detox.” It’s basically hydration + electrolytes + vitamin C. But as a morning ritual, it *can* help build consistency, which indirectly supports weight management.

I wrote a detailed breakdown (including nutrition numbers and prep cost) on Tasty Billions if anyone wants the full version. Not trying to sell anything — just documenting the experiment properly.

1r1rsqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r1rsqr/just_survived_my_first_solo_trip_to_the_balkans/,Just survived my first solo trip to the Balkans: Here's what surprised me most about making friends on the road 🤝,"Okay, so I just wrapped up my first solo trip through the Balkans, and honestly, the thing that caught me most off guard wasn't the incredible landscapes or the surprisingly strong coffee. It was how easy—and sometimes challenging—it was to connect with people. Before I left, I pictured myself as some lone wolf, wandering ancient streets in thoughtful silence. Turns out, the 'lone' part was optional.

I'll be upfront: my biggest pre-trip worry wasn't navigating dodgy bus stations or finding a decent SIM card; it was the quiet dread of eating every single meal alone. I'm an introvert, and the idea of ""putting myself out there"" felt like a second job. But what I discovered? You don't have to be a social butterfly to build real connections on the road.

Here's a breakdown of what surprised me most about making friends in the Balkans, plus some specifics from my trip:

*   **The Power of the Hostel Common Room (Yes, Even for Introverts):**
    *   My initial thought: ""Ugh, forced socializing."" My reality: it's a built-in icebreaker. I stayed mostly in highly-rated ""social"" hostels, which paradoxically meant I *didn't* have to try as hard.
    *   **Example:** In **Sarajevo**, at the Hostel Franz Ferdinand, I literally just sat down with my book in the common area, and within an hour, I was invited to join a group going for cevapi. The simple act of being present makes you approachable.
    *   **Cost:** Hostel dorms averaged €15-€25/night, a small price for instant community.

*   **Tours Aren't Just for Sightseeing; They're for Friend-Making:**
    *   I signed up for free walking tours in almost every city. You spend 2-3 hours with the same people, sharing a common experience. Conversation flows naturally after that.
    *   **Example:** In **Mostar**, after a fantastic walking tour, a few of us ended up grabbing lunch and then split a taxi to the Kravice Waterfalls. Instant travel buddies. In **Kotor**, a small group hike up to the fortress led to dinner and drinks later.
    *   **Logistics:** Look for local operators or ask your hostel for recommendations. Group day trips (like a vineyard tour near **Skopje** or a lake boat trip in **Ohrid**) are goldmines for meeting fellow travelers.

*   **Shared Annoyances (or Adventures) Bring People Together:**
    *   Let's be real, travel isn't always smooth. Sometimes, a missed bus or a confusing border crossing can be the catalyst for friendship.
    *   **Example:** On a particularly long bus journey from **Tirana** to **Ohrid**, two of us spent three hours trying to decipher a bewildering bus schedule in a language we didn't speak. By the time we got to our destination, we'd bonded over shared exasperation and were getting dinner together.
    *   **Real Talk:** These unexpected hiccups are often where the best stories, and sometimes the strongest bonds, are formed. Embrace the chaos a little.

*   **The ""Who Wants Dinner?"" Question is Your Friend:**
    *   After a day of exploring, people are usually ready to unwind. This is the easiest question to ask.
    *   **My method:** Find a few people who seem friendly, often from a tour or the hostel common room, and just say, ""Hey, I'm heading out for some local food, anyone want to join?"" More often than not, someone's in.
    *   **My total trip time:** 3 weeks across Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, and North Macedonia. I honestly ate alone maybe 3-4 times. That's a huge win for my introverted self.
    *   **Daily budget (excluding flights):** Around €50-€70, covering hostels, food, local transport, and a few activities. Splitting a meal or a taxi with new friends often made it even more budget-friendly.

*   **The Biggest Surprise? It's Less About Being ""Outgoing"" and More About Being ""Open.""**
    *   I didn't force conversations or try to be the life of the party. I just stayed open to invitations, made eye contact, and offered a friendly smile. Sometimes, that's all it takes for someone else to initiate.
    *   **Lesson Learned:** You don't need to be an extrovert to make friends solo. You just need to be willing to say ""yes"" when an opportunity arises, or gently create one yourself.

I found myself  
again  
at the long table.  
  
The stools at the counter  
are too hard  
and the small table  
next to the toilets  
carried with it  
the tell-tale scent  
of urinal cakes.  
  
So the long table it is.  
  
Large stone top,  
three chairs on either side  
and one at each end.  
The right side chair   
off-kilter   
like someones  
drunk uncle  
leaning into the table  
after one too many whiskeys.  
  
I perch in the middle  
a lone gargoyle  
on a wide battlement.  
  
The cafe is empty  
for the most part.  
There is a lady  
talking to a small  
child about the  
benefits of a  
hat on sunny days.  
Which he accepts  
by throwing it on the floor.  
She retrieves it scowling  
before scrunching it back  
into her handbag  
in a defeated manner.  
All the while  
mumbling some incantation  
to be far away,  
where sunshine  
wasn't invented.  
  
My coffee arrives  
the crema thick  
Swirling and steaming,  
a witches brew,  
a magic potion,  
to stir my creativity.  
  
So I stir  
in the sugar  
side to side  
as if holding  
a wand,  
the spoon    
clinking  
on the ceramic.  
  
The owner looks up,  
like the dinner bell has rung.   
I slump down in the chair  
so he doesn’t think  
it's me.  
The woman and child have left,  
(Maybe the spell worked)  
and if he cares  
he doesn’t say.  
  
So I sit,  
at my stone island  
contemplating the steam  
rising from the small  
porcelain volcano  
in front of me.  
  
All at once   
a group of suits walk in  
past the long table  
and as they do,  
they turn their heads,  
once to me  
and once to the empty cafe,  
as if to say,  
Who is this guy?  
The long table is for groups  
and you Sir  
are definitely  
not that.  
  
The leader   
a tall wiry haired spectre  
in a bone grey suit  
leans into the owner   
“we need that table,  
kill him!  
and dump his body in the alley”  
Or words to that effect.  
  
The owner laughs  
and they both  
turn and stare  
at me,  
calling to  
the spirits to  
move me on.  
Your powers don’t work on me!  
my potion is created  
and once made...  
CANNOT BE UNMADE!  
I think,  
and kick my leg spontaneously,  
knocking over  
the wobbly chair  
which clatters against  
the tile like  
a box of Jenga   
thrown down the stairs.  
  
All the suits turn  
and look at me.  
Eyes like fire arrows  
over the castle wall.  
My attempts to dive into my coffee    
to disguise  
the redness of my cheeks  
only results in scarlet  
being added to my tongue.  
As the cauldron claims  
more meat for the stew.  
Causing me to spring  
bolt upright.  
""Here, has the loong tebble.""  
I sputter  
burned tongue  
swollen  
cheeks puffed  
""I’m finish, you won tit.""  
""No that's ok…  
we’re just going  
to be taking away.""  
  
My holiday is  
ruined  
tongue  
and cheeks  
red  
as if from  
too much sun  
I stumble out  
of the cafe  
into the daylight  
like some  
sunburnt  
all-night  
party boy  
reject  
from a dance  
club in Ibiza.  
   
I turn   
and  
take  
one  
last look  
at  
The long table.  
Which now  
looks longer  
and emptier  
than ever.

Chapter 1 

I was sent to a hellish reform school by my parents for three long years. 

It was not until my brother returned from studying abroad that I was finally taken back home. 

At the dinner table, Dad called my name. 

I shot up in a conditioned reflex. “Number 92, Mila Wilder, present!” 

Mom’s eyes immediately welled up, her heart breaking for me. 

“Mila, we’re home now. Please don’t be like this, okay?” 

My Alpha father’s face went ashen, “We sent you there for your own good. Is this how you choose to 

blame us?” 

I snapped out of my daze and clenched my trembling hands. 

“I dare not. Everything I have is a gift from you. A daughter should obey her parents in all things.” 

After dinner, I obediently went to the kitchen to wash the dishes. 

Dad said, lowering his voice in the living room. 

“Look how sensible Mila is now. It just goes to show I made the right choice back then.” 

“A friend of mine has a daughter who ruined her entire life because she fell in with the wrong crowd.” 

“Giving up three years of her life to keep her on the straight and narrow was worth it.” 

But Dad, the place you sent me to was a living hell. 

Never mind. You’ll soon find out exactly what I went through there. 

I looked up at the river-crossing bridge not far away outside the window. 

Fireworks go off by the river every New Year’s Eve. 

I’ll jump off that bridge the moment the fireworks explode. 

A death this public should be enough to expose that hell. 

When I walked out of the kitchen, Mom was quick to pop a section of orange into my mouth. 

Oranges were my favorite fruit.

“I want to go to the riverbank to watch the fireworks. Is that all right with you, Mom?”

But… 

Wasn’t it you who said I was too disobedient, too unruly, that you had to send me there in the first place? 

She pulled me down next to her and rummaged through the gift bags scattered across the coffee table. 

“Look, these are all gifts we picked out just for you, exactly the things you like. There’s everything here. See if you like them.” 

My brother, sitting nearby, slung an arm around my shoulders. 

“Mom, I bet sis will like my gift way better.” 

He pulled the latest iPhone out from behind his back and held it up in front of me. 

s eyes shone with youthful pride. 

Every inch of my neck and shoulders, where his arm rested, went rigid. 

I managed a strained, bitter smile. 

It seemed I had sunk so low that even the touch of my own brother, who was a member of the opposite sex, filled me with revulsion. 

I fought down the wave of nausea and pushed him away. 

“Keep it for yourself. I don’t know how to use it anyway.” 

My brother slumped back on the sofa, crestfallen. 

Dad withdrew his scrutinizing gaze and nodded in approval. Chapter 1

“Take it, it’s from your brother. Dad believes you’ve turned over a new leaf and won’t get addicted to electronic gadgets.” 

As he spoke, he handed over two red envelopes. 

The thick one, stuffed so full it was almost bursting landed in my palm, while the thin, flimsy one 

went to my brother. 

“You haven’t been home for the New Year in years. This year, I’m making up for all of them.”

My Alpha father’s face went ashen, “We sent you there for your own good. Is this how you choose to 

blame us?” 

I snapped out of my daze and clenched my trembling hands. 

“I dare not. Everything I have is a gift from you. A daughter should obey her parents in all things.” 

After dinner, I obediently went to the kitchen to wash the dishes. 

Dad said, lowering his voice in the living room. 

“Look how sensible Mila is now. It just goes to show I made the right choice back then.” 

“A friend of mine has a daughter who ruined her entire life because she fell in with the wrong crowd.” 

“Giving up three years of her life to keep her on the straight and narrow was worth it.” 

But Dad, the place you sent me to was a living hell. 

Never mind. You’ll soon find out exactly what I went through there. 

I looked up at the river-crossing bridge not far away outside the window. 

Fireworks go off by the river every New Year’s Eve. 

I’ll jump off that bridge the moment the fireworks explode. 

A death this public should be enough to expose that hell. 

When I walked out of the kitchen, Mom was quick to pop a section of orange into my mouth. 

Oranges were my favorite fruit.

At the beginning I had constant diarrhea (reason for my initial Drs visit) and then after antibiotics and berberine I had constipation. 

Then for a magical short time when I was in the middle of taking berberine and oregano, I suddenly had very “normal” healthy BM like it would come out in one go and not be difficult or painful. it lasted a few weeks where i had regular BM almost every day like clockwork in the morning, no constipation, no diarrhea, it was such a huge relief tbh. It lasted about a month and my lower belly was even less protruded as well. 

However i may have experienced some kind of relapse because now i am super bloated, super constipated and only have BM every few days. Sometimes i’m super constipated and have that weird backed up feeling yet still need tons of coffee to even have a hope of having a BM then feel uncomfortable the rest of the day. Anyway it also happens that it no longer comes out in one go, even tho it feels urgent and have to run to the bathroom, there’s only some that is able to out the first time and then the rest slowly is able to “release” itself in a few more tries several hours throughout the day. like no matter how hard i try i cannot get it all to come out in only one go. so i have multiple days of constipation then one day where everything tries to come out but can’t and becomes multiple urgent BM that alternates between constipation and diarrhea…

Cereal contains:

\- oatmeal 

\- some chocolate chips

\- guarana powder 

\- lactose free milk 

Some basic information about my „condition“:

\- had gastrocospy (no signs of anything like cancer, diverticula, etc. - runs in my family)

\- no biopsy for celiac disease or SIBO yet (appointments were made, test kit already collected at the doctors office) 

\- taking Venlafaxin (225mg per day, 1 - 0 - 0) due to depression and OCD 

\- not very much of a morning person, but not getting up with my partner around 7 results in me not getting up at all & having back pain and heachaches all day)

\- when I‘m getting up, I am trying to eat some breakfast- since I am getting naseauos when I am not eating & tired when I am not getting guarana in my System (my body does not accept coffee at all, sometimes not even black tea)

1r1revr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1r1revr/how_to_build_real_career_stability_the/,# How to Build REAL Career Stability: The Science-Based Skills That Actually Matter (Your Degree Won't Cut It),"I spent years believing the formula: good grades → good degree → good job → financial security. Then I graduated with honors and couldn't land an interview to save my life. Turns out, the correlation between academic success and career stability is way weaker than we're told. I got obsessed with this question and dove into books, podcasts, research studies, and interviews with actual hiring managers. What I found was equal parts liberating and frustrating.

The problem isn't you being lazy or incompetent. The mismatch exists because academic institutions optimize for knowledge retention and test performance, while employers need emotional intelligence, networking ability, and practical problem solving. These are fundamentally different skill sets. Your 4.0 GPA proves you can memorize and regurgitate information under pressure. It doesn't prove you can negotiate a contract, manage a difficult client, or pivot when a project goes sideways. Society sells us this narrative that education equals employability, but it's incomplete at best.

Here's what actually builds career stability, backed by people who study this stuff for a living.

**Financial literacy is the foundation nobody teaches you.** Morgan Housel's [The Psychology of Money ](https://a.co/d/042TTkr7)completely rewired how I think about wealth. Housel is a partner at Collaborative Fund and former Wall Street Journal columnist, and this book is a New York Times bestseller for good reason. It's not about stock tips or crypto schemes. It's about understanding that building wealth is 80% behavior and 20% knowledge. One insight that hit me hard: wealthy people don't necessarily earn more, they just have a longer time horizon and resist lifestyle inflation. This book will make you question every financial decision you've ever made, in the best way possible. Genuinely one of the most practical books I've ever read about money.

**Learn to sell yourself, not just your credentials.** The brutal truth is that charisma and communication skills often matter more than your transcript. Ramit Sethi talks about this constantly on his podcast and in his work. He's built multiple successful businesses and teaches people how to earn more by positioning themselves effectively. His approach isn't about fake confidence or manipulation, it's about articulating your value in terms employers actually care about. He breaks down real salary negotiations and shows you exactly where people lose thousands of dollars by being too passive or apologetic. His stuff on freelancing and side hustles is also ridiculously actionable if you want income diversification.

**Build skills employers actually need right now.** The gap between what universities teach and what the job market demands is growing. Daniel Pink's [A Whole New Mind ](https://a.co/d/0i55VLUP)explores this shift brilliantly. Pink is a bestselling author and former chief speechwriter for Al Gore, so he understands how economies and labor markets evolve. His thesis is that we're moving from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age, where creativity, empathy, and synthesis matter more than pure analytical skills. He identifies six essential aptitudes: design, story, symphony (big picture thinking), empathy, play, and meaning. Reading this helped me understand why my engineering degree wasn't enough. Technical skills are table stakes now. You need the soft skills layered on top.

If you want to go deeper on career skills and financial literacy but feel overwhelmed by where to start, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) has been genuinely useful. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google AI experts that pulls from books, research papers, and expert insights on career development and money management. You can set a specific goal like ""learn to negotiate salary as someone who hates conflict"" and it generates a structured learning plan with audio podcasts customized to your depth preference, from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too. It's been helpful for making these topics feel less intimidating and more actionable without doomscrolling.

**Your network is your net worth.** Cliche but statistically true. Most jobs aren't posted publicly, they're filled through referrals. Keith Ferrazzi's *Never Eat Alone* is the classic here, though I'll warn you it can feel a bit aggressive in places. The core principle is sound though: professional relationships should be mutually beneficial and built on genuine interest, not transactional networking. Start having coffee chats with people in industries you're curious about. Join professional groups. Comment thoughtfully on LinkedIn posts. These small touches compound over time. I landed my current role because someone I helped with a project two years ago remembered me when their company had an opening.

**Develop financial resilience through multiple income streams.** Academic training pushes us toward single employer dependency, which is increasingly risky. The app Monarch Money has been incredibly helpful for tracking my finances and identifying where I can optimize. It aggregates all your accounts and helps you set realistic savings goals. Seeing everything in one place made me realize I was spending $200 monthly on subscriptions I forgot about. Small leaks sink ships. Once you have visibility into your spending patterns, you can redirect that money toward building an emergency fund or investing. Financial advisors recommend having six months of expenses saved, but even starting with one month gives you breathing room.

The system isn't designed to fail you on purpose, but it wasn't designed for the current job market either. Universities move slowly, economies move fast. That gap is where anxiety lives. The good news is you can close it yourself through strategic skill building and financial literacy. Your degree matters, but it's just one piece. Focus on becoming someone who solves problems, communicates clearly, and understands money. Those skills translate everywhere.",1,1770796710.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

During my application, I mentioned that I am naturally shy and that I need some time to adjust before I feel comfortable speaking openly. Despite that, my promotors still chose me for this position, and I am genuinely interested in the research. My main promotor is also very kind towards me.

However, the working environment with my direct colleagues has become increasingly difficult. I share an office space with clinical research nurses (and one other PhD student who is also an assistant anesthetist). In the beginning, I felt welcomed, but as the weeks passed and I was still a bit quiet, their attitude toward me changed. Eventually, they moved me to the desk farthest away. When I asked if I could return to the shared room, they refused, saying they needed the empty desk to organize paperwork. In reality, every time I walk past that room, the desk remains unused. As a result, I now sit alone in a separate room all day.

They also stopped inviting me to the daily coffee moments. Throughout the day, they whisper and gossip constantly. I don’t know whether they gossip about me, but I do notice that whenever a colleague leaves the room, they immediately start talking negatively about that person. This creates a very unsafe atmosphere. The previous PhD student who originally held this position actually quit, and my colleagues now speak very poorly of her because she was “quiet.” That makes me worry that they see me the same way and might be dismissing me for similar reasons.

Another incident that made me uncomfortable was when the other PhD student was talking with my co‑promotor. The connecting door between our rooms is normally always open, but they closed it deliberately. I could hear my name being mentioned several times, which made me feel excluded and anxious about what was being discussed.

I also notice that positive achievements are met with negativity. Recently, I received an award for best abstract at a conference, which I was proud of, especially so early in my PhD. My colleagues’ only reaction was: “So you just get free participation next year? That’s not exciting. Can’t they do anything right?” Comments like that make it difficult to feel supported.

What concerns me even more is the influence my colleagues seem to have on how my promotors perceive others. For example, the master’s student currently doing an internship with us was initially viewed positively by the promotors. But after my colleagues repeatedly spoke negatively about him, the promotors’ opinion shifted. In my view, this student was essentially pushed out; they had no patience for him, and everything he did was criticized. Seeing how easily their opinions changed makes me afraid that something similar could happen to me.

There is also the possibility for me to sit with other PhD students in the basement, which could be a more supportive environment. However, I am afraid to bring this up with my promotors. My current colleagues openly dislike the PhD students downstairs, and I worry that moving there would push me even further away from the group and reinforce their negative perception of me.

Because of all these experiences, I feel increasingly uncomfortable in the group. I hesitate to bring this up with my promotors, as they have a good relationship with my colleagues, and I worry that their perception of me might already be influenced by what my colleagues say. I don't know what to do, but I do know that my mental health is suffering from this. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!",3,1770796094.0,AskAcademia,0,0.8,False

1r1r4na,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInTips/comments/1r1r4na/i_sent_500_linkedin_connection_requests_in_60/,I sent 500 LinkedIn connection requests in 60 days. 380 accepted. Here's the exact strategy that worked.,"Two months ago, my LinkedIn was dead. 340 connections, zero engagement, zero opportunities.

I ran a 60-day experiment to fix this.

**The Numbers:**

500 connection requests sent  
380 accepted (76% acceptance rate)  
142 actual conversations  
23 coffee chats scheduled  
8 business opportunities  
2 client deals closed

Revenue generated: $14,700

**The 4-Step Strategy:**

**Step 1: Target Hard**

Filtered by job title, company size, and recent activity. Only connected with decision makers who posted in the last 30 days.

Result: Acceptance rate doubled from 41% to 76%

**Step 2: Personalize the First Line**

Spent 30 seconds per request. Referenced their recent post or company news.

Generic message acceptance: 41%  
Personalized message acceptance: 76%

**Step 3: Three-Touch Follow-Up**

Day 1: Thank you message with one specific question  
Day 4: Share relevant resource, no ask  
Day 8: Soft pitch for quick call

Response rate: 37%

**Step 4: Engage First**

Liked and commented on their posts for one week before sending requests.

With prior engagement: 84% acceptance  
Without engagement: 68% acceptance

**What I Learned About Timing:**

Tuesday and Wednesday requests get accepted 22% more than Friday.

Morning requests (9-11 AM) get 31% higher acceptance rates.

Mentioning mutual connections increases acceptance by 40%.

**The Automation Part:**

Manual approach: 10 requests daily, 15 minutes  
My approach: 25 requests daily, 15 minutes

I use bearconnect to handle the repetitive tasks. 

The tool sends requests, runs follow-up sequences, and tracks responses.

I write the personalized messages and have the real conversations.

Time saved: 10 hours weekly

**Biggest Mistakes:**

Week 1: Sent 50 generic requests. Got 18 acceptances, zero conversations.

Week 3: Tried 7-step sequences. People stopped responding after step 3.

Week 5: Asked for calls too soon. Scared people off.

**Results After 60 Days:**

Network: 340 to 720 connections  
Profile views: 80 to 340 monthly  
Post engagement: 12 to 85 likes average  
Inbound messages: 2 to 18 monthly

**The System Now:**

Morning (10 minutes): Check acceptances, respond to messages, adjust templates.

Automation handles: 25 daily requests, follow-up sequences, response tracking.

Weekly review (20 minutes): Check acceptance rates, test message templates, adjust targeting.

Total time: 90 minutes weekly for 100+ quality connections monthly.

**Quick Reality Check:**

How many connection requests did you send last week?

How many were actually personalized?

How many times did you follow up after acceptance?

The truth: LinkedIn rewards consistency. 5 quality requests daily beats 50 random requests once a month.

Christina’s POV

Slap!

My head snapped to the side, vision blurring, skin burning as if someone had pressed a brand into me. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t even process it.

My fated mate just hit me.

Three minutes ago, I’d been stupidly daydreaming about curtains, rugs, chandeliers, wondering how I would make the ridiculously expensive pack house look less like a museum screaming I have more money than personality.

Two minutes ago, I’d knocked over a framed photograph in his bedroom. Just an accident. A picture of my sister smiling like the golden saint she always was.

Now, blood rushed in my ears as the sting on my face spread, sharp and humiliating. The boy I once believed was my forever had just turned me into the villain of his story.

Akira roared inside me, claws scraping at the walls of my chest.

Rage, betrayal, heartbreak swirled together until I could barely breathe.

Niall’s lips pressed into a tight line.”You broke the only photo I had with Beatrice. Your jealousy makes me sick.”

“Are you fucking insane?” I gritted my teeth.

“No, you’re the insane one!” he roared.”I already agreed to marry you,what more do you want? Beatrice had to leave because of you!Because you exposed our mate bond and forced me to accept you!”

The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the slap.

“She was your sister! And now you’re jealous? You won’t rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?” He said in anger as he shoved me backward, into the coffee table.

Sharp pain sliced through my palm as I landed on the shattered glass frame.

Blood smeared across Beatrice’s perfect smile.

How poetic.

My cheek throbbed. My hand was bleeding.But nothing hurt more than the realization that my so-called mate had never loved me.

“It wasn’t me,” I said, one final attempt at reason.”I never forced this mate bond on you. I never asked her to leave.”

I saw this movie at the theater and loved it. I cried at the end. The Horse is just fine in the movie for anyone worried about that. Whenever I see a movie with an animal, I always ask the same question. Is the animal going to be ok? John Wick got away with it because he got revenge for her.

One of the many Bruceploitation movies. Basically a movie that came out after Bruce Lee sadly passed away. They usually had someone who looked like him or whose name sounded like him to capitalize on his popularity. A lot of them are really good martial arts movies. I definitely recommend them.

Looks like this Bruceploitation movie stars Bruce Li. He also starred in Bruce Lee: The Man, the Myth widely considered to be one of the best Bruceploitation movies. Of course Vudu doesn't have it. At least I have it on Prime. When I was younger, I was wondering how it could show Bruce Lee die in the beginning and then continue on through the rest of the movie. Now I know. Half documentary, half exploitation movie. I still have the VHS somewhere. Bruce Li was one of the best Bruce Lee imitators before he retired. Moving on.

1r1qxob,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1r1qxob/bill_out_drama/,Bill out drama,"Naalala ko nung nagwo-work pa ako sa coffee shop (fresh grad ako nun and first work ko din). May dumating na customer bandang tanghali, mga tatlo sila. Nag-order sila ng 3 drinks at 1 food. Tapos nung mag-aala-una na ng hapon, may dumating pa silang ibang kasamahan hanggang sa naging 16 pax na silang lahat. Nasakop nila yung table sa tapat ng store namin.

Narinig ko pa yung iba na tinatawag yung isang lalaki na ""gov,"" sinasabi na manlilibre raw si gov. Minumukhaan ko yung lalaki pero hindi ko matukoy kung sino siya-parang nakita ko na yung mukha niya dati. Hanggang sa inabot na sila ng gabi, andun pa rin sila. Naiinis na yung TL ko kasi 16 pax sila pero tatlo lang yung inorder, tapos inabot pa ng gabi. Imbis na makaupo yung ibang customers, wala na silang maupuan kasi nasakop nila yung table sa tapat.

Nung magbi-bill out na, pumunta yung ""gov"" na sinasabi nila sa CR at sinabi niyang separate daw yung bill. Inayos na ng TL ko yung billing, pero ang tagal niya sa CR, kaya sinabi ng TL ko na dalhin ko na yung bill sa table. Nung dinala ko na yung bill, sabi ko lang, ""Iwan ko lang po yung bill,"" tapos nagulat yung mga kasamahan niya. Bakit daw naka-separate-akala kasi nila si gov daw ang magbabayad. Syempre, hindi ko naman alam yun, kaya umalis na ako pagkatapos kong ilapag yung bill.

Nung lumabas na siya ng CR, hinanap niya yung bill at tinanong kung nasaan na. Sabi ng TL ko, andun na raw sa table. Bigla siyang nagalit at sinabi na bakit ko raw nilagay dun, baka akalain daw ng mga kasamahan niya na nagpapalibre siya. Kung anu-ano na yung sinabi niya sa akin-masakit-hanggang sa sinabi pa na ipapatanggal daw niya ako sa store. Syempre, nagulat ako at nag-loading yung utak ko, kaya humingi na lang ako ng sorry sabi ko ""Pasensya na po hindi ko po alam sinunod ko lang po yung utos ng TL namin"".

Hanggang sa kinausap na rin siya ng TL at humingi rin ng pasensya. Ayun, umalis siyang bad trip. Ilang araw ang lumipas, bwisit pa rin ako sa kanya kasi ginagawa ko lang naman yung trabaho ko pero kung anu-ano na yung sinabi niya. Iniisip ko kung saan ko ba talaga siya nakita, tapos may naalala akong tao, kaya sinearch ko sa Google yung pangalan. Then boom-tama nga hinala ko, si J/\*!%c nga.

Nung sinabi ko sa kasamahan ko na si J\\\*!%c yun, sabi niya hindi raw malayo yung mukha. Nung tinignan ko sa Google, sure na sure ako na siya yun-ikaw ba naman ipahiya sa harap ng maraming tao. Kaya simula nun, bad trip na ako sa kanya pag nakikita ko siya.

By: u/AvSurvdio 


Started on: 19/12/2025 (December, 19th, 2025)

---


The grass atop the cliff bellowed no name and claimed no borders, just the peace, quiet, and the caress of a soft, gentle breeze. Before the lands of gold, there stood a cliff of seldom. But it was named home by an Uma named Stay Gold. Above him, the colour orange painted the skies of a setting sun, setting the scenery. While below, the calm, blue waters of a lagoon mirrored a serenity unknown to the bustling cities far behind.

...

The day was over, but so was the legend and tale of ""the terrorist of the track"". All he could do was walk the lands, looking for the horizon's edge. Glory and stories lay far in the past. As all he searched for now was purpose. Like many Umas before him, their dreams were to run, to race, and to reach the summit. He achieved that all and hammered his family's name, ""Gold"", into history. But... it felt so empty. Despite all his crowns, all the applause, all the riches he wrought... He still ventured like an explorer searching for a missing treasure. No one understood why... only he understood the meaning of his grand ventures and constant escape from reality.

On this particular day, the blades of grass bent and folded against the wind. Stay gold was relaxed, sitting on the edge. His hands pressed into the Earth. In his mind, thoughts blended into memories, and those memories started to replay like ""what if"" situations.

What if he pushed himself?
What if he never left?
What if... He was in love?

""No... that can't be right."" Stay Gold shook his head sharply, scoffing bitterly. Rising from his position, he starts pacing in tight circles; his brow furrows, and his tail starts lashing around, agitated at the thought. ""Love? Ha! Like I could ever... love... someone...?"" He pauses his mindless circling. ... Love. Foreign, unknown, yet strangely familiar... Love, love, love... swirled in his thoughts... The storm within his mind pauses. Ans in the cornee of his eyed... a strangely familiar object... ""A trinket..."" His voice softened as a memory resurfaced.

""Stego!"" The voice was feminine, weary, and tired. Her visage was a blur, a memory from days that were bygones in the past... he couldn't make out the face, their name lost to the rivers of time... all he remembers is her presence, her care, the victories and losses they shared... and the love that she gave him. Stego, for the first time since the wake of his failures, felt his chest flutter. Yet, he tried to cast off the feeling. With a roar of frustration, he stomps his foot into the ground as if trying to physically push the memory away. ""Before you leave... take this!"" Another phrase... is... is this a memory from a ceremony? His graduation ceremony?

And then it all returned. He remembers it fully. The trinket he wears, the earring... it was from her. ""Torenah-san..."" His hand clenches tightly around the earring. He knows why he is feeling this right now; he just doesn't want to acknowledge it... the world in his mind shifted to resemble rain. Heavy, pouring rain. As his thoughts spiralled into his inner emotions and feelings... Pain. ""Stego... you're... going to what?"" The voice sounded like it came from behind him. To Stego, it was like reliving a nightmare of his decisions.

In his chest, his heart started to pound. Louder, harder, till he felt it in. Ache... and now? Tears. Why was he crying? He remembers, but he doesn't want to remember, while at the same time he wants to remember all the same. It pains him; it breaks him. He knows what happened; he just... refuses to remember his faults. ""Torenah-san..."" His voice was solemn, yet at the same time, resolute. ""I... I will come back..."" Stay Gold declares. He knows he left, but now? He understood what he had abandoned. His fist slams into the nearest tree, shaking the trunk, shaking the leaves, and scaring the birds that reside in it. His knuckles were bruised but paled in comparison to the bleeding gash that is still within his soul... And now? He now realises this.

A new journey awaits, not forwards, but backwards. Though not in time, he will retrace his steps back home.

...

The sun shone darker, colder, a reminder. Stay Gold looked onwards, solemn. Yet determined to fix the tragedy which was wrought by his mistakes. The sky shifted into night. He trudged forth even when his feet ached, even when his boots were torn open like wounds. Fragments of his past started resurfacing. A song, a crowd... but never a name.

""How many years has it been?"" Stay Gold questioned. Wondering if this journey would bear fruit... for the mistakes he had sown into the Earth were already part of history. ""I'll wait for you... even if it takes a lifetime."" The voice of his trainer plays. A fuzzy, yet familiar tone. It stings to remember. The day he left her, especially when he promised her this: ""I'll come back one day."" But was this ""one day"" too many days too late? Has it already been a lifetime?

""No... it can't be..."" He refuted. Denying that possibility. Yet deep down, he knew... maybe he was too late. Maybe... By chance. Could she still be waiting for him even after these many years? A spark of hope struck the embers of his long-forgotten flame. ""Could she... still love me...?"" Love. Hah. That word again. Could she ever love him? They say love lasts forever, but could it truly last that long even after being separated? For this long? That was a question Stay Gold begged to be answered. And at the same time... to never be answered. For words are like blades. But they do not merely stab the heart; they stab the soul. Words like those do not merely split; they shatter like a hammer.

...

The road was long, longer than any track he ran. He could count the steps and the stars as he moved, but as many as he could count, is as numerous as the reasons he loves his trainer and more. A car passes, their headlights illuminating the darkness of the countryside road. ""The moon was beautiful, isn't it?"" Another memory of the past comes rushing back. ""Yes... indeed it is Torenah-san."" Back then, he only thought that she meant the moon was beautiful. But now? He realised how naive he was.

She loved him.

He loved her too... how could he not see the signs? How could he not see the gleam in her eyes? Whenever they passed, she smiled, he returned the gesture, only thinking of: ""She's too good for me."" Why... why was he such a fool? His heart ached more as he realised his ignorance... the moonlight shone down on him. The trees rustled from the wind, the leaves singing a soft melody...

He passed suburbs and farms that stretched for miles on end. A car passed sometimes, other times were just nothing. Only the breeze passed by to comfort him. Then dawn came. He couldn't bear to look up as the soft blue and yellowy tints reminded him of her eyes. No wonder why he hated and loved the sunrise. ""I expected you to be here, Stego-san."" He heard her voice again. Day dreaming of the time when he and her shared a cup of coffee on a bench. When he was still her trainee.

""I sometimes wonder how many days we could spend like this..."" Stego blurted out. Causing her to blush softly, her eyes widening for a fraction of a second before a gentle smile finds its way up her lips. ""I hope everyday can be just like this."" She responded. Stego merely laughed crossing his legs as he took another sip of the hot beverage. ""Me too. Me too."" Tapping the rim of his cup, he looked out into the distance. His voice was soft, nonchalant, and disbelieving, garnering a pout out of her. ""Don't say that... you matter to me, you know!"" Her voice fades... so does the memory.

""Me too... me too..."" Stay Gold repeated. He unknowingly smiled while he walked... a frown taking the place on his face as he snapped back to the reality of his situation. ""I'll come back... I promise..."" Stay Gold took flight, his legs sprung into action as he started to dash along the country road. He needs to see her again even if for one last time.

...

The journey was a blur, mountain ranges morphed into windmills and flat terrain as the cityscape draws near. The soft gentle breeze of the wind turns into loud, un-uniformed screams and wails of car horns, voices, and billboards flashing advertisements, names, and... Tracen Academy? He swears he remembers that name...

Stay Gold's appearance was disheveled, dirtied, and unclean. Many took notice and stood clear of him. Though embarrassed, his only goal was to find her... ""Damnit... I don't even remember her name anymore..."" Stay Gold muttered in frustration. Her face, he can barely make it out. Her voice was the only thing he could remember clearly...

...

The sun was setting once more... he wandered the streets aimlessly, astounded by how much society evolved from his departure... there were not this many sky scrapers, there was not this many cars, there were not this many phones... the world was brighter, warmer, filled with interesting things he didn't have in his time. But it wasn't as warm without her. ""Her... damn it all..."" Stay Gold muttered. He truly forgotten. He passed by a cafe that felt... strangely familiar. His steps paused, the familiar scent of freshly brewed coffee filled the air and his nostrils. ""Could it be the same coffee shop?"" Stay Gold wanders in. Despite his rugged appearance, he wasn't immediately noticed till—

""Stego-san... is that you?"" His ears perks up as a matured voice calls out. He swears he remembers... turning his head to the side, he was greeted by a warm hug which turns into him being lifted up... ""Ah... it's been so long Stego-san!"" Her voice was uplifting, energetic... could it be? ""Torenah-san?"" He muttered under his breath, the woman heard his words and setted him down, seemingly angered at his words. ""To-re-nah-san?! Have you forgotten me??"" She shouted louder, catching the attention of the coffee shop. Stay Gold then feels two warm hands cupping his cheeks, one caressing the dirt off. ""Ah... maybe I was too harsh, wasn't I, eh?"" The woman's voice was apologetic, realising her mistake.

""It's me! Lauren-chan! Remember me, Stego-san?"" Lauren? It feels like a distant memory that he remembers... ""Lauren-chan...?"" Stay Gold muttered, tilting his head to the side as a memory of the past come rushing back... ""Stego-sann.... give me uppies!"" A younger Lauren pouts, looking up at Stay Gold with a childish look. His trainer in turn stifles a laugh.

""L-Lauren-chan... pfft—"" Stay Gold's trainer can't hold it in anymore, going into a full blown laughter as Stay Gold picks the small Lauren up and into his arms. Nearby, an older woman starts laughing aswell, presumably Lauren's mother.

# 

Look, if you've been playing around with AI video generation tools, you already know the struggle. You type something in, hit generate, and get back...well, not quite what you imagined. Maybe the camera's doing weird things, the characters look different in every shot, or the whole thing just feels kind of off.

Kling 3.0 changes that game completely. But here's the thing: you can't just throw random descriptions at it and expect magic. This tool thinks differently than older models, and once you understand how it actually works, you'll be creating stuff that looks genuinely cinematic.

I'm going to walk you through exactly how to prompt Kling 3.0 so you get the results you're actually looking for. No fluff, no corporate speak. Just real talk about what works.

# Stop Thinking in Clips, Start Thinking in Shots

Here's where most people mess up right from the start. They write prompts like they're describing a single video clip: ""A girl walks through a forest and then sits down by a river."" That might have worked okay with older AI models, but Kling 3.0 is built differently.

This model understands filmmaking. Like, actually understands it. When you prompt it, you need to think like a director breaking down a scene, not someone describing what they saw in a dream.

# What Does ""Thinking in Shots"" Actually Mean?

Instead of cramming everything into one messy description, break your idea into separate shots. Kling 3.0 can handle up to six shots in a single generation, which is wild. But you need to tell it what each shot is.

Here's what I mean:

**Bad prompt:** ""A detective investigates a crime scene and finds a clue then looks worried.""

**Good prompt:**

* Shot 1: Wide shot of a dimly lit warehouse, detective enters from the left, camera tracks with him as he walks toward a desk
* Shot 2: Medium close-up, detective picks up a photograph, his eyes widen
* Shot 3: Extreme close-up of the photograph showing a face he recognizes
* Shot 4: Profile shot of detective's face, realization dawning, camera slowly pushes in

See the difference? You're giving the AI a storyboard, not a summary. Each shot has its own framing, its own purpose, its own camera movement.

# The Language Matters

Kling 3.0 speaks cinema. Words like ""tracking shot,"" ""POV,"" ""macro close-up,"" ""shot-reverse-shot,"" and ""profile shot"" aren't just fancy terms. They're instructions the model actually understands and follows.

When you say ""tracking shot,"" it knows you want the camera to follow the subject smoothly. When you say ""POV,"" it knows whose perspective we're seeing from. This isn't magic, it's just really good training.

**Example Prompt:**

""Shot 1: Wide establishing shot of a neon-lit Tokyo street at night, rain reflecting the lights. Shot 2: Medium tracking shot following a woman in a red coat as she walks through the crowd, camera stays at her shoulder level. Shot 3: Close-up profile of her face as she stops, neon signs reflecting in her eyes. Shot 4: POV shot from her perspective, looking at a familiar cafe across the street.""

Try this prompt and you'll see how the model creates distinct shots that flow together naturally. Each one has its own composition, but they tell a connected story.

# Lock Down Your Characters Early (This Is Super Important)

One of the coolest upgrades in Kling 3.0 is character consistency. Older models would give you a blonde character in shot one and a brunette in shot two, even though it's supposed to be the same person. Frustrating, right?

Kling 3.0 fixes this, but you need to help it out by establishing your characters right from the start.

# How to Describe Characters Properly

At the beginning of your prompt, introduce your main characters with clear, specific details. Think of it like you're briefing a casting director. You don't need a novel, but you need enough that the AI can lock onto those features.

**Example Character Setup:**

""Main character: Sarah, mid-20s woman with shoulder-length black hair in a loose bun, wearing round glasses, olive skin, dressed in a gray oversized hoodie and black jeans. She has expressive eyes and moves with nervous energy.""

Once you've established Sarah like this, the model will keep her looking consistent across all your shots. You can reference her by name in later shots: ""Sarah turns around,"" ""Sarah's eyes widen,"" ""Sarah speaks softly.""

# Keep It Consistent Across Shots

Don't suddenly call her ""the girl"" or ""the woman"" in later shots if you started with ""Sarah."" The model uses these references to maintain consistency. Stick with the same identifiers.

**Example Multi-Shot Prompt with Character Consistency:**

""Characters: Marcus, a tall Black man in his 30s with short natural hair and a navy peacoat. Elena, a petite woman with long curly red hair, wearing a yellow raincoat.

Shot 1: Medium two-shot, Marcus and Elena stand on a rainy bridge, facing each other. Camera holds steady between them.

Shot 2: Close-up on Marcus's face as he speaks, concern in his eyes, rain dripping down his face.

Shot 3: Shot-reverse-shot, close-up on Elena's face as she listens, her expression shifting from anger to sadness.

Shot 4: Wide shot, Marcus reaches out, Elena steps back, camera pulls back slowly revealing the empty bridge around them.""

The model will keep Marcus and Elena looking the same throughout because you anchored them clearly at the start.

# Get Specific About Movement (Or It'll Get Weird)

Vague motion descriptions are the enemy of good AI video. ""The camera moves"" could mean anything. Does it pan? Tilt? Track? Zoom? Each creates a completely different feel.

Kling 3.0 responds really well when you're explicit about both camera movement and subject movement.

# Camera Movement Terms That Work

* **Tracking shot:** Camera follows the subject, keeping them in frame
* **Pan:** Camera rotates horizontally, usually on a fixed point
* **Tilt:** Camera rotates vertically
* **Push in:** Camera moves closer to the subject
* **Pull back:** Camera moves away from the subject
* **Freeze:** Camera holds completely still
* **Handheld:** Camera has slight natural shake, feels documentary-style
* **Steadicam:** Smooth gliding camera movement
* **Crane shot:** Camera moves vertically up or down

# Subject Movement Matters Too

Don't just say ""a person runs."" Tell the AI how they run, where they're going, what changes during the run.

**Weak prompt:** ""A skateboarder does tricks.""

**Strong prompt:** ""Medium tracking shot following a skateboarder from the side as she pushes off hard, gains speed, approaches a ramp. Camera stays level with her as she launches into the air, spins 360 degrees, then lands smoothly. Camera freezes as she comes to a stop, feet planted.""

See how much clearer that is? The AI knows exactly what to show and when.

**Example Prompt:**

""Wide shot of a dense forest trail. Camera slowly pushes forward along the path, revealing a cyclist approaching from deep in the frame. As the cyclist gets closer, camera switches to a tracking shot, following alongside them at medium distance. Cyclist speeds up, camera keeps pace. They hit a jump, camera tilts up following the arc, then tilts down as they land. Camera holds steady as cyclist rides out of frame right.""

# Using Native Audio (Game Changer for Dialogue)

This is where Kling 3.0 gets really interesting. It can generate native audio, including actual dialogue with lip sync, ambient sounds, and different voice tones. But you need to prompt it correctly.

# Setting Up Dialogue Scenes

When you're doing dialogue, you need to be crystal clear about who's speaking and when. The model can handle multiple characters talking, but it needs structure.

**Basic Dialogue Structure:**

1. Establish your characters first (names, descriptions)
2. Indicate who speaks when using their name
3. Add tone descriptors for how they speak
4. Write the actual dialogue in quotes

**Example Dialogue Prompt:**

""Characters: James, a nervous young man in a suit sitting across a desk. Dr. Rivera, a confident woman in her 50s with gray hair, sitting behind the desk.

Shot 1: Medium two-shot showing both characters. James speaks first, his voice shaky and quiet: 'I don't know if I can do this.' Dr. Rivera leans forward, her tone warm and reassuring: 'You're more ready than you think, James.'

Shot 2: Close-up on James's face as he responds, voice still uncertain: 'What if I mess everything up?' His eyes dart down.

Shot 3: Shot-reverse-shot, close-up on Dr. Rivera, her voice becomes firmer, encouraging: 'Then you'll learn something valuable. Fear of failure isn't a reason to never try.'""

The tone descriptors (shaky, quiet, warm, reassuring, uncertain, firm, encouraging) help the model generate appropriate voice characteristics and facial expressions.

# Multi-Language Support

Here's something cool: Kling 3.0 can handle different languages and even code-switching (when people mix languages in the same conversation). If you're making content for multilingual audiences, this opens up so many possibilities.

**Example Bilingual Prompt:**

""Characters: Sofia, a young Latina woman. Tom, her American friend.

Shot 1: Medium shot in a cafe. Sofia speaks in Spanish, animated and fast: '¿Y entonces qué le dijiste?' Tom responds in English with a confused smile: 'Wait, wait, slow down. What did I say to who?'

Shot 2: Close-up on Sofia, she laughs and switches to English, speaking slower: 'Sorry! I asked what you told her.' Tom's voice off-screen, relieved: 'Oh! I just said we should talk.'""

# Long-Form Content: Using Those 15 Seconds

Kling 3.0 supports up to 15 seconds of generation. That might not sound like much, but in video terms, 15 seconds is a small eternity. You can tell an actual story in that time.

The key is thinking about progression. How does your scene develop over time? What changes? Where does the energy build or release?

# Building Progression Into Your Prompts

Don't just describe a static scene that happens to last 15 seconds. Describe evolution, change, escalation, or resolution.

**Example Long-Form Prompt:**

""10-second continuous shot: Opens on a wide view of an empty basketball court at dusk, orange light streaming through windows. Camera slowly tracks right across the court. A basketball rolls into frame from the left, bouncing naturally. A teenager jogs into frame chasing it, catches it mid-bounce. She dribbles twice, testing the ball. Takes a deep breath, looks at the hoop. Camera pushes in slowly to a medium shot as she lifts the ball, focuses. She shoots. Camera follows the ball's arc through the air in slow motion as it swishes through the net. Camera pulls back to wide as she pumps her fist once, small smile, then walks off screen right.""

That's a complete little moment with a beginning, middle, and end. The camera movement supports the emotional arc. It's not just ""a girl makes a basketball shot."" It's a story.

**Example Prompt for Practice:**

""12-second continuous shot: Close-up on a coffee cup on a table, steam rising. Camera slowly pulls back, revealing a woman sitting alone at a window-side cafe table, staring outside. She absently stirs her coffee, lost in thought. Through the window behind her, people walk past on the busy street. She suddenly looks down at her phone as it lights up on the table. Camera pushes in slightly as she reads the message. Her expression shifts from neutral to a small, genuine smile. She picks up the phone and starts typing a response, more animated now.""

# Image-to-Video: Making Still Images Come Alive

When you're starting with an existing image and want to add movement, Kling 3.0 treats that image as your foundation. All the details, text, colors, composition - they stay locked in while the AI adds motion.

# How to Prompt Image-to-Video Effectively

Your prompt should focus on what moves and how, not redescribing what's already in the image. The AI can see the image. You're just directing the motion.

**Approach for Image-to-Video:**

1. Reference key elements in the image that should move
2. Describe the type and direction of movement
3. Include camera motion if needed
4. Keep it simple and focused

**Example Image-to-Video Prompt (for an image of a city street):**

""Camera slowly pushes forward down the street. Cars drive past from right to left. Pedestrians walk along the sidewalks. Store signs flicker and glow. Traffic lights change from red to green. Gentle camera movement, everything else stays natural.""

**Example Image-to-Video Prompt (for an image of a product on a table):**

""Camera slowly orbits around the product clockwise, keeping it centered. Soft lighting shifts as camera moves. Product remains in perfect focus throughout. Smooth, professional camera movement.""

The model preserves text, logos, specific colors, and compositional elements from your source image while adding the motion you describe.

# Pro Tips That Actually Make a Difference

Let me share some stuff I've learned through trial and error that the official guides don't always emphasize.

# Lighting Descriptions Matter More Than You Think

Don't just say ""a room."" Say ""a softly lit room with warm table lamps"" or ""a harshly lit interrogation room with a single overhead bulb."" The lighting affects everything: mood, visibility, atmosphere.

**Quick Lighting Reference:**

* Soft, diffused light: Creates gentle, flattering looks
* Hard, direct light: Creates strong shadows and drama
* Golden hour: Warm, orange-tinted natural light (sunset/sunrise)
* Blue hour: Cool, blue-tinted light (just after sunset)
* Neon lighting: Colored, artificial, urban feel
* Candlelight: Warm, flickering, intimate
* Harsh overhead: Clinical, institutional, unflattering

# Pacing Words Control the Feel

Words that describe timing change how your scene feels:

* ""Slowly"" - creates calm, contemplation, tension
* ""Suddenly"" - creates surprise, energy, shock
* ""Gradually"" - creates evolution, transformation
* ""Quickly"" - creates urgency, excitement, chaos
* ""Hesitantly"" - creates uncertainty, doubt
* ""Deliberately"" - creates intention, confidence

**Example Showing Pacing:**

""Wide shot of a dark hallway. Camera slowly tracks forward. A door at the end suddenly bursts open. A figure quickly runs through and stops abruptly in the center of the frame. They hesitantly turn around, looking back. Camera gradually pushes in on their face as realization dawns.""

# Environment Isn't Background, It's Character

Your setting should do work in your prompts. Don't treat it as throwaway context.

**Generic:** ""A man walks down a street.""

**Specific:** ""A man in a business suit walks down a rain-slicked New York street at night, neon signs reflecting in puddles around his feet, taxi headlights streaking past.""

That second one puts you in a place, a mood, a world.

# Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

# Mistake 1: Overloading One Shot

Trying to fit too much action into a single shot description.

**Fix:** Break it into multiple shots. If your character ""walks in, sits down, picks up a phone, and starts talking,"" that's at least three shots.

# Mistake 2: Forgetting Camera Position

Describing what happens but not where the camera is watching from.

**Fix:** Every shot should have a framing indicator - wide, medium, close-up, extreme close-up, etc.

# Mistake 3: Inconsistent Character References

Calling the same character ""the woman,"" then ""she,"" then ""the blonde,"" then ""the person.""

**Fix:** Pick a name or consistent descriptor and stick with it throughout.

# Mistake 4: Vague Action Words

""Moves,"" ""goes,"" ""does something.""

**Fix:** Be specific - ""sprints,"" ""tiptoes,"" ""slumps forward,"" ""lunges.""

# Mistake 5: No Emotional Direction

Describing actions without the feeling behind them.

**Fix:** Add emotion and intention - ""angrily slams the door,"" ""gently places the book down,"" ""nervously checks the time.""

# Practical Prompt Examples You Can Use Right Now

I'm going to give you some complete prompts you can actually use or adapt. These follow all the principles we've talked about.

# Example 1: Product Showcase

""Shot 1: Extreme close-up macro shot of water droplets on a sleek black smartphone screen, camera slowly slides right across the surface.

Shot 2: Camera pulls back to medium shot, revealing the full phone on a minimalist white surface with dramatic side lighting.

Shot 3: Phone screen illuminates, displaying a vibrant app interface. Camera slowly orbits the phone counterclockwise.

Shot 4: Close-up as a hand enters frame and picks up the phone smoothly, camera follows the movement up.""

# Example 2: Emotional Scene

""Characters: Anna, a woman in her late 20s with tied-back brown hair, wearing a denim jacket. David, a man in his 30s with stubble and a worn leather jacket.

Shot 1: Medium two-shot in a parking lot at dusk. Anna and David stand by a car, facing each other. Orange sunset light behind them. Anna speaks first, voice firm but pained: 'This doesn't work anymore, David.'

Shot 2: Close-up on David's face, shot-reverse-shot. His expression crumbles slightly. He speaks quietly, almost whispering: 'Don't say that. We can fix this.'

Shot 3: Close-up on Anna's face, tears starting to form but she stays composed. She shakes her head slowly: 'Some things can't be fixed. We both know that.'

Shot 4: Wide shot pulling back, showing them standing apart, the distance between them growing as Anna turns and walks toward the car. David stands motionless. Camera continues pulling back.""

# Example 3: Action Sequence

""Shot 1: Wide shot of an underground parking garage, fluorescent lights flickering. Camera tracks with a woman sprinting full speed between parked cars, her footsteps echoing.

Shot 2: Medium tracking shot from her side, keeping pace as she runs. She glances back over her shoulder, fear in her eyes.

Shot 3: POV shot from her perspective, looking back to see a shadowy figure running after her in the distance.

Shot 4: Close-up on her face as she spots an exit door ahead. She pushes harder, breathing heavy.

Shot 5: Wide shot as she bursts through the exit door into bright daylight. Camera holds as the door swings shut behind her.""

# Example 4: Atmospheric World-Building

""8-second continuous shot: Opens on a close-up of rain hitting a neon sign in Japanese characters, water streaming down. Camera slowly tilts down, revealing a narrow Tokyo alley below. As camera descends, the alley comes into view: steam rising from a ramen shop, a cat darting across, a few people with umbrellas walking past. Ambient sounds of rain, distant traffic, muffled conversations. Camera continues slow descent until reaching street level, coming to rest on a puddle reflecting all the neon lights above.""

# Example 5: Comedy Timing

""Characters: Mike, an awkward guy in a button-up shirt that's too small. Lisa, a confident woman in professional attire.

Shot 1: Medium shot in an elevator. Mike and Lisa stand side by side, facing forward. Awkward silence. Mike glances at Lisa nervously.

Shot 2: Close-up on Mike as he clears his throat and speaks, trying to sound casual: 'So... nice weather we're having.' Camera holds on his forced smile.

Shot 3: Close-up on Lisa, shot-reverse-shot. She slowly turns her head to look at him, one eyebrow raised. She responds flatly: 'We're underground.'

Shot 4: Close-up on Mike's face as the realization hits him. His smile fades. He looks forward again, defeated. Long pause.

Shot 5: Wide shot of the elevator. Both face forward in uncomfortable silence. The elevator dings.""

# Example 6: Nature Documentary Style

""10-second shot: Opens on an extreme close-up macro view of morning dew on a spider web, early golden light filtering through. Camera very slowly pulls back, revealing the full intricate web suspended between two branches. A small spider waits motionless in the center. Gentle breeze causes the web to sway slightly. Camera continues pulling back smoothly, revealing the forest around the web, other trees coming into focus. Ambient sounds of morning birds, rustling leaves.""

# Advanced Techniques for When You're Ready

Once you've got the basics down, here are some more sophisticated approaches.

# Combining Camera Moves

Don't stick to one type of movement per shot. Real cinematography combines moves.

""Camera starts on a close-up of a locked door handle. Slowly pushes in while simultaneously tilting up to reveal a small window above. Through the window, a face appears. Camera freezes, holding on the face for two beats, then quickly pulls back and pans right to show someone standing in the room watching the window.""

# Using Depth of Field in Prompts

Describe what's in focus and what's not.

""Shallow depth of field, close-up on a chess piece in sharp focus in the foreground. A hand reaches into the blurred background and comes forward into focus as it picks up the piece.""

# Motivated Camera Movement

The best camera movements have a reason - they reveal something, follow something, or react to something.

""Camera holds steady on a woman reading a book on a park bench. She suddenly looks up, startled. Camera quickly pans left to reveal what caught her attention: a dog running loose across the grass.""

# Building Suspense Through Camera Work

""Slow push-in on a closed bedroom door. Camera movement gets gradually slower as it gets closer, building tension. Just before reaching the door, camera stops completely and holds. Three beats of stillness. Door suddenly swings open.""

# Final Thoughts on Getting Good at This

Here's the real talk: your first few prompts probably won't be perfect. That's normal. Prompting Kling 3.0 is a skill, and like any skill, you get better with practice.

Start simple. Do single shots before multi-shot sequences. Get comfortable with camera terminology. Play with different types of movement. Try dialogue after you've nailed visual scenes.

Save prompts that work well. Build your own library. When you create something that looks exactly how you imagined, analyze why. What did you write that made it work? Use that knowledge for next time.

The amazing thing about Kling 3.0 is that it rewards good direction. The better your prompts, the better your results. You're not fighting the tool or hoping for luck. You're communicating clearly with a system that understands filmmaking language.

Think like a director. Write like you're explaining your vision to a talented crew. Be specific about what you want to see, how you want to see it, and how it should make people feel.

Most importantly, experiment. Try weird combinations. Test your limits. See what happens when you push the boundaries. Some of the best results come from trying something you're not sure will work.

You've got a powerful tool here. Now you know how to use it properly. Go make something amazing.

# Quick Reference Sheet

# Essential Camera Terms

* Wide shot: Shows full scene and environment
* Medium shot: Shows subject from waist up
* Close-up: Shows face or object detail
* Extreme close-up: Shows tiny detail, very intimate
* Tracking shot: Camera follows subject
* POV: Point of view, seeing through character's eyes
* Shot-reverse-shot: Alternating views, common in dialogue
* Pan: Camera rotates horizontally
* Tilt: Camera rotates vertically
* Push in: Camera moves toward subject
* Pull back: Camera moves away from subject

# Character Consistency Checklist

1. Define characters clearly at the start
2. Include physical details (hair, clothing, features)
3. Use consistent names or descriptors
4. Reference them the same way in each shot
5. Establish their spatial relationship early

# Motion Description Framework

1. What moves (subject, camera, both)
2. How it moves (speed, quality)
3. When it moves (timing, triggers)
4. Where it moves (direction, path)
5. Why it moves (motivation, purpose)

# Dialogue Setup Formula

1. Establish speakers with unique descriptions
2. Assign speaking order clearly
3. Add tone/emotion descriptors
4. Write actual dialogue in quotes
5. Include relevant camera coverage

# Quality Boosters

* Lighting specifics
* Emotional descriptors
* Pacing words
* Environmental details
* Sound cues (if using audio)
* Transitions between shots

This is your playbook. Refer back to it, test these approaches, and watch your Kling 3.0 results get consistently better. You've got this.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

Sometimes things don't work out exactly as planned. Here's how to diagnose and fix the most common problems.

# Issue: Characters Keep Changing Appearance

**What's happening:** Your character looks different across shots even though you described them.

**Solution:** Make your initial character description more detailed and specific. Instead of ""a man with dark hair,"" try ""a tall man in his early 30s with short black hair styled to the right, clean-shaven, wearing a navy blue hoodie and wire-frame glasses.""

Also check that you're using the exact same name or descriptor in every shot. If you call them ""Marcus"" in shot one and ""the man"" in shot three, the AI might not connect them.

# Issue: Camera Movement Feels Jerky or Unnatural

**What's happening:** The camera isn't moving smoothly or feels disconnected from the action.

**Solution:** Add movement quality descriptors. Words like ""smoothly,"" ""gently,"" ""gradually,"" or ""fluidly"" help. Also specify the relationship between camera and subject: ""camera follows closely behind,"" ""camera maintains medium distance,"" ""camera stays level with subject's face.""

# Issue: Action Happens Too Fast or Too Slow

**What's happening:** The pacing feels off for what you wanted.

**Solution:** Use temporal descriptors more explicitly. ""Slowly walks"" versus ""quickly runs."" ""Gradually turns"" versus ""suddenly spins."" If you're working with longer durations, describe the pacing evolution: ""starts slow, builds speed, then stops abruptly.""

# Issue: Dialogue Doesn't Match Character Movement

**What's happening:** The lips don't sync well or the facial expressions feel off.

**Solution:** Be more specific about how the character delivers the line. Add descriptors about facial expression, body language, and tone before the actual dialogue. ""Marcus leans back, crosses his arms defensively, and speaks with an edge to his voice: 'I never said that.'""

# Issue: Multi-Shot Sequences Feel Disconnected

**What's happening:** Individual shots look good but don't flow together as a coherent scene.

**Solution:** Add transition language between shots and maintain spatial consistency. Reference where characters are positioned relative to each other and the environment. ""Shot 1: Emma stands screen left, facing right. Shot 2: Shot-reverse-shot, now we see what she's looking at, Jake stands screen right facing left.""

# Real-World Applications

Let me show you how to apply these techniques to actual use cases you might encounter.

# Creating Social Media Content

For quick social media videos, you want impact fast. Focus on dynamic camera movement and clear visual hooks.

""3-second shot: Extreme close-up on hands unboxing a product, camera tilts up as hands lift the item out, revealing it in perfect light. Quick cut feeling.""

# Making Advertisements

Ads need to show products clearly while creating emotional connection.

""Shot 1: Product centered on clean background, soft dramatic lighting from the left, camera slowly orbits right. Shot 2: Close-up on key product feature, camera pushes in to highlight detail. Shot 3: Lifestyle shot, person using product naturally, camera holds steady on their satisfied expression. Shot 4: Return to hero shot of product, screen fades to white.""

# Building Music Video Sequences

Music videos thrive on visual rhythm and mood.

""Shot 1: Low angle wide shot, performer stands backlit on empty stage, silhouette visible, camera slowly rises. Shot 2: Medium shot, performer starts moving with beat, camera circles them clockwise. Shot 3: Close-up on performer's face as they sing chorus, colored lights flash across their features. Shot 4: Wide shot pulls back revealing full stage setup, camera continues rising above the scene.""

# Educational Content

Teaching content needs clarity and careful pacing to help viewers follow along.

""Shot 1: Close-up on hands demonstrating the first step clearly, camera holds steady, good lighting shows detail. Shot 2: Medium shot pulling back to show full context of what's being taught. Shot 3: Different angle showing the same action, helping viewer understand from multiple perspectives. Shot 4: Close-up on finished result, camera slowly pushes in to emphasize completion.""

# Why This All Matters

Understanding how to prompt Kling 3.0 properly isn't just about getting prettier videos. It's about being able to actually express your creative vision. When you know how to communicate with the tool, you stop fighting it and start collaborating with it.

Every improvement in your prompting skills directly translates to better output. That means less time regenerating, less frustration, and more time creating genuinely cool stuff.

The skills you build here transfer too. Learning to think in shots, describe motion precisely, and structure scenes logically makes you better at all kinds of creative work, whether you're using AI or not.

So take the time to really understand these principles. Practice with different scenarios. Build your instinct for what works. The investment pays off every single time you generate a video that makes you think, ""Yes, that's exactly what I wanted.""

Remember, Kling 3.0 is a tool, and like any professional tool, it performs best in skilled hands. Now your hands are skilled. Go create something that surprises you.

# Chapter 1 Rejecting Me for His Ex’s Photo

Christina’s POV

Slap!

My head snapped to the side, vision blurring, skin burning as if someone had pressed a brand into me. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t even process it.

My fated mate just hit me.

Three minutes ago, I’d been stupidly daydreaming about curtains, rugs, chandeliers, wondering how I would make the ridiculously expensive pack house look less like a museum screaming I have more money than personality.

Two minutes ago, I’d knocked over a framed photograph in his bedroom. Just an accident. A picture of my sister smiling like the golden saint she always was.

Now, blood rushed in my ears as the sting on my face spread, sharp and humiliating. The boy I once believed was my forever had just turned me into the villain of his story.

Akira roared inside me, claws scraping at the walls of my chest.

Rage, betrayal, heartbreak swirled together until I could barely breathe.

Niall’s lips pressed into a tight line.”You broke the only photo I had with Beatrice. Your jealousy makes me sick.”

“Are you fucking insane?” I gritted my teeth.

“No, you’re the insane one!” he roared.”I already agreed to marry you,what more do you want? Beatrice had to leave because of you!Because you exposed our mate bond and forced me to accept you!”

The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the slap.

“She was your sister! And now you’re jealous? You won’t rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?” He said in anger as he shoved me backward, into the coffee table.

Sharp pain sliced through my palm as I landed on the shattered glass frame.

Blood smeared across Beatrice’s perfect smile.

How poetic.

My cheek throbbed. My hand was bleeding.But nothing hurt more than the realization that my so-called mate had never loved me.

“It wasn’t me,” I said, one final attempt at reason.”I never forced this mate bond on you. I never asked her to leave.”

Technically speaking, I understood why someone might blame me.

On my eighteenth birthday, I shifted and realized Niall was my fated mate.Stupidly, I wrote it all down in my diary.I planned to tell him when he returned from his business trip. If he couldn’t accept me, I was prepared for rejection.

But Beatrice found my diary and made it public.

Privacy was apparently a foreign concept to her. She told everyone in The Crescent pack about my diary.

I was dragged out and shamed as the pathetic spare who dared reach above her station for her perfect sister’s Alpha.

Then Beatrice graciously left for abroad,leaving behind a letter saying she’d “discovered my secret” and decided to “let go,” to “let him be mine.”

My sister was about as generous as a reality TV contestant with someone else’s money.

And I? I was the villain who drove away The Crescent Pack’s perfect princess.

To my family,I’d been bumped to the starting lineup after years on the bench,so I should’ve been [grateful.My](http://grateful.My) parents didn’t truly care which daughter married Niall, only that the pack alliance was sealed.Even if Niall had literally ripped my heart out, my parents would’ve handed him napkins to clean up.

It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much I outperformed Beatrice in training, they always made excuses for her and found fault with me. I was bitter, ungrateful, someone who couldn’t appreciate her dear sister.

My fingers clenched around the engagement ring.This pathetic symbol of our joke mateship.

Hot tears blurred my vision. I blinked them back fast.

I bolted for the door.Had to get out before the tears came.

Niall grabbed my wrist to stop me. “Clean it up.”

“What?”I stared him in disbelief, needing to confirm I’d heard him right.

“You broke the photo frame. Clean up the pieces.” Ice-cold command.

Too bad I never was good at taking orders.

“No.” I lifted my chin. Zero compromise.

His jaw clenched. “You sure you want to do this, Christina?”

“Yes. I said no.” I stared him down without flinching.

If love meant grinding my self-respect into cigarette ash, then fuck love.

The air between us snapped, tension rising like a storm. He leaned in, fury blazing. “Last chance. Disobey me, and I’ll end this bond right here—”

“We are over,” I cut in.

Shock froze his face.

For a moment,the air went still.

He hadn’t expected me to actually say it.

I yanked my arm free, breath hitching as hope for escape flared—only for him to seize me again, his grip bruising, his eyes burning with something close to hatred.

“This is on you, Christina!” Niall snarled, his tone that of a sworn enemy rather than the mate fate had chained me to.

“I, Niall Granger, Alpha of the Frostpelt Pack, reject—”

“Shut the hell up!” I snapped.

If anyone was ending this bond, it would be me.

My gaze locked onto his, unflinching.

“You don’t get to reject me. I reject you, Niall. Now accept it.”

The world seemed to crack in half.

Akira howled inside me, a keening wail of loss, while searing agony tore through my chest as the bond unraveled thread by thread.

His jaw tightened,but he forced the words past clenched teeth.

“I accept your rejection. Now clean up your mess and fix the damn photo.”

My hands shook as I picked up the shattered frame, shards biting into my skin, my blood smearing across the glass. I tore the picture down the middle, ripping his face away from my sister’s, as if severing every last tie.

Without hesitation,I swung my hand and slapped him hard across that infuriatingly handsome, arrogant face. The crack echoed between us.

I leaned in, letting him see the fire in my eyes.

“Now,” I hissed, “we’re done..”

The silence was absolute.

My palm stung, but oh, the satisfaction almost dulled the pain in my chest.

Niall staggered back, shock flashing in his eyes.

It wasn’t from pain, but from realizing the docile girl he’d despised no longer existed.

I smiled coldly. “Goodbye, Niall. Go worship your shrine to Beatrice.”

And I walked out of that suffocating hell, head high.

I would rather drown in my own tears than let him see one more drop.

When I reached the parking lot, the cold night air hit my face, but overwhelming pain crashed over me like a tidal wave.

Fuck, no one ever told me that breaking the mate bond would be this excruciating.

It felt like having my heart sliced up and served to Hannibal Lecter.He’d probably enjoy it with a nice chianti and some fava bean sauce.

I curled up in the driver’s seat, cold sweat streaming down my face.

Akira lay weakly inside me,whimpering,”It’s so fucking strange!Like someone reached into my gut and tore something out with their fist.”

I couldn’t agree more.

I wanted to find my mother,she would definitely know how to ease this kind of pain.

Or maybe any creature in pain instinctively thinks of their mother.

As I hesitated between sending a mind-link or making a call, my phone vibrated.

My eyes were so blurry that I fumbled to swipe and answer.

“Chrissy, you must be insane!” My mother screamed.”How dare you humiliate Niall like this! The pack alliance is ruined!”

“Mom, he rejected me,” I said weakly. “As in, formally. Also, he hit me. So there’s that fun detail.”

“He… what?” For once, she sounded stunned.

My dad’s voice cut in, “Don’t be dramatic. After everything Beatrice sacrificed for you? You will apologize to Niall immediately and beg him to marry you, or you’re no longer welcome in our territory!”

He hung up before I could respond.

I stared at my phone in bewilderment, my father’s words echoing in my head.

Not “Are you okay?” Not “We’re coming to get you.”

Just threats about banishing me from the pack.

Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn’t earn even a sliver of their approval? When I was rejected by my mate and dying from the pain, all my parents could think about was the pack alliance and my fucking sister who had disappeared God knows where!

Beatrice never had to do anything, yet she was their precious jewel.

So, this is it?

On the day I severed the mate bond with my fated mate, I finally realized that my parents had never loved me.

It shattered my last remaining, pathetic and pitiful longing for my parents’ love.

Enough.

I was done trying to earn love that would never be given.

I was done being the convenient backup daughter.

I was taking back the self-respect I’d lost long ago, and I was breaking free of this engagement—no matter the consequences.",1,1770794669.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

My gaze locked onto his, unflinching.

“You don’t get to reject me. I reject you, Niall. Now accept it.”

The world seemed to crack in half.

Akira howled inside me, a keening wail of loss, while searing agony tore through my chest as the bond unraveled thread by thread.

His jaw tightened,but he forced the words past clenched teeth.

“I accept your rejection. Now clean up your mess and fix the damn photo.”

My hands shook as I picked up the shattered frame, shards biting into my skin, my blood smearing across the glass. I tore the picture down the middle, ripping his face away from my sister’s, as if severing every last tie.

Without hesitation,I swung my hand and slapped him hard across that infuriatingly handsome, arrogant face. The crack echoed between us.

I leaned in, letting him see the fire in my eyes.

“Now,” I hissed, “we’re done..”

The silence was absolute.

My palm stung, but oh, the satisfaction almost dulled the pain in my chest.

Niall staggered back, shock flashing in his eyes.

It wasn’t from pain, but from realizing the docile girl he’d despised no longer existed.

I smiled coldly. “Goodbye, Niall. Go worship your shrine to Beatrice.”

And I walked out of that suffocating hell, head high.

I would rather drown in my own tears than let him see one more drop.

When I reached the parking lot, the cold night air hit my face, but overwhelming pain crashed over me like a tidal wave.

Fuck, no one ever told me that breaking the mate bond would be this excruciating.

It felt like having my heart sliced up and served to Hannibal Lecter.He’d probably enjoy it with a nice chianti and some fava bean sauce.

I curled up in the driver’s seat, cold sweat streaming down my face.

Akira lay weakly inside me,whimpering,”It’s so fucking strange!Like someone reached into my gut and tore something out with their fist.”

I couldn’t agree more.

I wanted to find my mother,she would definitely know how to ease this kind of pain.

Or maybe any creature in pain instinctively thinks of their mother.

As I hesitated between sending a mind-link or making a call, my phone vibrated.

My eyes were so blurry that I fumbled to swipe and answer.

“Chrissy, you must be insane!” My mother screamed.”How dare you humiliate Niall like this! The pack alliance is ruined!”

“Mom, he rejected me,” I said weakly. “As in, formally. Also, he hit me. So there’s that fun detail.”

“He… what?” For once, she sounded stunned.

My dad’s voice cut in, “Don’t be dramatic. After everything Beatrice sacrificed for you? You will apologize to Niall immediately and beg him to marry you, or you’re no longer welcome in our territory!”

He hung up before I could respond.

I stared at my phone in bewilderment, my father’s words echoing in my head.

Not “Are you okay?” Not “We’re coming to get you.”

Just threats about banishing me from the pack.

Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn’t earn even a sliver of their approval? When I was rejected by my mate and dying from the pain, all my parents could think about was the pack alliance and my fucking sister who had disappeared God knows where!

Beatrice never had to do anything, yet she was their precious jewel.

So, this is it?

On the day I severed the mate bond with my fated mate, I finally realized that my parents had never loved me.

It shattered my last remaining, pathetic and pitiful longing for my parents’ love.

Enough.

I was done trying to earn love that would never be given.

I was done being the convenient backup daughter.

Back to light reddit to do its wonder again

I’m 27 guy and moved over from Manchester a few months ago. I’m living just outside Brisbane (about 20 minutes from the city), and I’m in town pretty regularly. Work’s all sorted and I’m settling in well, but I’m still building my social circle.

I’m into staying active, gym most days and running and I enjoy travelling, trying new food spots, checking out cafés, and exploring new places. I’m easygoing and always up for anything from grabbing a coffee or training together to checking out events, spontaneous weekend plans, or a chilled movie night.

I guess i am trying to find my friend circle.

Would be great to meet some good people who are keen to hang out and make the most of living in Brisbane. If that sounds like your vibe, feel free to comment or send me a message. Also open to any recommendations for social groups or regular meetups worth checking out.

Or just have a lot of things going on in their mind?

Me and my boyfriend haven't had sex often lately. Only once a week when i come over to his place on my day off.

Before we have sex every other day or so. Lately i notice his sex drive significantly decreased. I went to his place last night as usual but we didn't have sex (i went to bed before him cuz i couldn't wait as i got sleepy and he took too long to come to bed). He told me it's because he's busy and has a lot of things going on as he's trying to get his coffee shop ready to open next week. He does masturbate tho. So it made me think does he not enjoy our sex? Or he's cheating? But i can't find a time where he can go out and cheat cuz we do have dinner together daily. It really confuses me cuz whenever we had sex, he seemed like he loved it and couldn't control his orgasm.

Can anyone give me an advice? Do you think he's just no longer enjoy and looking forward to our sex?

# Chapter 1 Rejecting Me for His Ex’s Photo

Christina’s POV

Slap!

My head snapped to the side, vision blurring, skin burning as if someone had pressed a brand into me. For a heartbeat, I couldn’t even process it.

My fated mate just hit me.

Three minutes ago, I’d been stupidly daydreaming about curtains, rugs, chandeliers, wondering how I would make the ridiculously expensive pack house look less like a museum screaming I have more money than personality.

Two minutes ago, I’d knocked over a framed photograph in his bedroom. Just an accident. A picture of my sister smiling like the golden saint she always was.

Now, blood rushed in my ears as the sting on my face spread, sharp and humiliating. The boy I once believed was my forever had just turned me into the villain of his story.

Akira roared inside me, claws scraping at the walls of my chest.

Rage, betrayal, heartbreak swirled together until I could barely breathe.

Niall’s lips pressed into a tight line.”You broke the only photo I had with Beatrice. Your jealousy makes me sick.”

“Are you fucking insane?” I gritted my teeth.

“No, you’re the insane one!” he roared.”I already agreed to marry you,what more do you want? Beatrice had to leave because of you!Because you exposed our mate bond and forced me to accept you!”

The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the slap.

“She was your sister! And now you’re jealous? You won’t rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?” He said in anger as he shoved me backward, into the coffee table.

Sharp pain sliced through my palm as I landed on the shattered glass frame.

Blood smeared across Beatrice’s perfect smile.

How poetic.

My cheek throbbed. My hand was bleeding.But nothing hurt more than the realization that my so-called mate had never loved me.

“It wasn’t me,” I said, one final attempt at reason.”I never forced this mate bond on you. I never asked her to leave.”

Technically speaking, I understood why someone might blame me.

On my eighteenth birthday, I shifted and realized Niall was my fated mate.Stupidly, I wrote it all down in my diary.I planned to tell him when he returned from his business trip. If he couldn’t accept me, I was prepared for rejection.

But Beatrice found my diary and made it public.

Privacy was apparently a foreign concept to her. She told everyone in The Crescent pack about my diary.

I was dragged out and shamed as the pathetic spare who dared reach above her station for her perfect sister’s Alpha.

Then Beatrice graciously left for abroad,leaving behind a letter saying she’d “discovered my secret” and decided to “let go,” to “let him be mine.”

My sister was about as generous as a reality TV contestant with someone else’s money.

And I? I was the villain who drove away The Crescent Pack’s perfect princess.

To my family,I’d been bumped to the starting lineup after years on the bench,so I should’ve been [grateful.My](http://grateful.My) parents didn’t truly care which daughter married Niall, only that the pack alliance was sealed.Even if Niall had literally ripped my heart out, my parents would’ve handed him napkins to clean up.

It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much I outperformed Beatrice in training, they always made excuses for her and found fault with me. I was bitter, ungrateful, someone who couldn’t appreciate her dear sister.

My fingers clenched around the engagement ring.This pathetic symbol of our joke mateship.

Hot tears blurred my vision. I blinked them back fast.

I bolted for the door.Had to get out before the tears came.

Niall grabbed my wrist to stop me. “Clean it up.”

“What?”I stared him in disbelief, needing to confirm I’d heard him right.

“You broke the photo frame. Clean up the pieces.” Ice-cold command.

Too bad I never was good at taking orders.

“No.” I lifted my chin. Zero compromise.

His jaw clenched. “You sure you want to do this, Christina?”

“Yes. I said no.” I stared him down without flinching.

If love meant grinding my self-respect into cigarette ash, then fuck love.

The air between us snapped, tension rising like a storm. He leaned in, fury blazing. “Last chance. Disobey me, and I’ll end this bond right here—”

“We are over,” I cut in.

Shock froze his face.

For a moment,the air went still.

He hadn’t expected me to actually say it.

I yanked my arm free, breath hitching as hope for escape flared—only for him to seize me again, his grip bruising, his eyes burning with something close to hatred.

“This is on you, Christina!” Niall snarled, his tone that of a sworn enemy rather than the mate fate had chained me to.

“I, Niall Granger, Alpha of the Frostpelt Pack, reject—”

“Shut the hell up!” I snapped.

If anyone was ending this bond, it would be me.

My gaze locked onto his, unflinching.

“You don’t get to reject me. I reject you, Niall. Now accept it.”

When I reached the parking lot, the cold night air hit my face, but overwhelming pain crashed over me like a tidal wave.

Fuck, no one ever told me that breaking the mate bond would be this excruciating.

It felt like having my heart sliced up and served to Hannibal Lecter.He’d probably enjoy it with a nice chianti and some fava bean sauce.

I curled up in the driver’s seat, cold sweat streaming down my face.

Akira lay weakly inside me,whimpering,”It’s so fucking strange!Like someone reached into my gut and tore something out with their fist.”

I couldn’t agree more.

I wanted to find my mother,she would definitely know how to ease this kind of pain.

Or maybe any creature in pain instinctively thinks of their mother.

As I hesitated between sending a mind-link or making a call, my phone vibrated.

My eyes were so blurry that I fumbled to swipe and answer.

“Chrissy, you must be insane!” My mother screamed.”How dare you humiliate Niall like this! The pack alliance is ruined!”

“Mom, he rejected me,” I said weakly. “As in, formally. Also, he hit me. So there’s that fun detail.”

“He… what?” For once, she sounded stunned.

My dad’s voice cut in, “Don’t be dramatic. After everything Beatrice sacrificed for you? You will apologize to Niall immediately and beg him to marry you, or you’re no longer welcome in our territory!”

He hung up before I could respond.

I stared at my phone in bewilderment, my father’s words echoing in my head.

Not “Are you okay?” Not “We’re coming to get you.”

Just threats about banishing me from the pack.

Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn’t earn even a sliver of their approval? When I was rejected by my mate and dying from the pain, all my parents could think about was the pack alliance and my fucking sister who had disappeared God knows where!

Beatrice never had to do anything, yet she was their precious jewel.

So, this is it?

On the day I severed the mate bond with my fated mate, I finally realized that my parents had never loved me.

It shattered my last remaining, pathetic and pitiful longing for my parents’ love.

Enough.

I was done trying to earn love that would never be given.

I was done being the convenient backup daughter.

I was taking back the self-respect I’d lost long ago, and I was breaking free of this engagement—no matter the consequences.

That was me last week, diving headfirst into a 'chaotic curator' inspired eye look for a low-key coffee shop visit. The goal: embrace asymmetry and unexpected textures, but still look like I *meant* it, not like I just rolled out of bed with last night's eyeliner.

Here's how that experiment unfolded:

*   **Concept:** Blending muted, almost ""dusty"" tones with a sudden pop of unconventional shimmer, echoing the accidental beauty of a cluttered artist's studio or an artfully disheveled display. My vision leaned heavily into the 'chaotic curator' aesthetic, where intentional disarray is the ultimate statement.
*   **Key Products Used:**
    *   **Base:** A matte cream eyeshadow stick in a warm taupe (drugstore brand, approx. $8). Applied this somewhat messily all over the lid.
    *   **Main Shadow:** A deep, slightly desaturated teal matte eyeshadow (from a larger indie palette, individual pan approx. $6). This was concentrated on the outer V and smudged under the lower lash line.
    *   **The ""Pop"" Element:** A chunky, multi-chrome glitter paste with a green-to-blue shift (indie brand, approx. $15). This was my wild card, the unexpected art piece.
    *   **Liner:** A smudgy kohl pencil in dark brown (approx. $10).
    *   **Brows:** Just clear brow gel to keep them natural and a bit unruly, matching the unpolished vibe.
*   **Application & Technique:**
    *   The taupe cream stick was swiped on, then blended out with a finger, intentionally leaving some edges soft and undefined – a foundation for the chaos.
    *   The matte teal was packed on with a flat brush, then softly diffused with a fluffy brush, letting it blend into the taupe base without aiming for a perfectly clean transition.
    *   Here's where it got truly experimental: I dabbed the multi-chrome glitter *only* on the center of the right eyelid with a flat synthetic brush, completely skipping the left eye. The idea was intentional asymmetry, like an unexpected jewel placed amidst other objects.
    *   The kohl liner was smudged along the upper lash line, then blended out with a small brush to blur it, not create a crisp, defined line.
*   **Time Invested:** Roughly 20 minutes for the eyes. The rest of my face was minimal – tinted moisturizer and a touch of blush to keep the focus on the eye.
*   **Inspiration:** The layered, slightly unfinished quality of a maximalist art installation, or the unexpected glint of an antique amidst everyday objects. Definitely pulling from a modern 'chaotic curator' energy.

Okay, confession time: the first pass with the glitter was... a lot. I initially tried to apply it to both eyes and it looked less ""curated chaos"" and more ""I spilled craft supplies on my face and ran out the door."" I ended up wiping off the left eye's glitter completely and toning down the right by gently pressing a clean finger over it to remove some excess, leaving just a concentrated, slightly chunky gleam. It wasn't the ""perfect"" application you see in glossy tutorials, but the smudgy, almost lived-in feel was exactly what I wanted for that unpolished vibe. The asymmetry felt a bit daring at first, making me wonder if I'd look like I forgot a step, but it quickly became the most interesting and defining part of the look. Definitely learned that sometimes, less *is* more, especially when you're trying to make chaos look intentional.

**Q.** Evaluate the usefulness of the concept of elasticity of demand to FWB when deciding on a new marketing mix.

**A.** FWB can use 2 types of elasticities of demand. First, being price elasticity of demand. This measures the customer's responsiveness to changes in price. An inelastic demand suggests that FWB’s customers' demand doesn’t change significantly with respond to changes in price. This means that the coffee FWB sells has a price-inelastic demand as it is less than 1 (0.37). Using this FWB can increase the price of coffee to a greater extent as customers believe it to be an essential. As by increasing the price, the customer base will shrink insignificantly, leading to FWB earning a higher revenue. This helps FWB to achieve its objective to increase revenue by 15%. Therefore, using price elasticity of demand, FWB can implement price skimming as their pricing strategy to increase revenue.

Another elasticity of demand is promotional elasticity of demand, which indicates the effectiveness of promotion to increase revenue. An inelastic promotional elasticity shows the ineffectiveness of FWB’s promotion in increasing revenue. Since FWB’s promotional inelasticity is 0.8, it means that FWB’s current promotional strategy has to change, as it has an insignificant impact on revenue. By experimenting different promotional strategy other than advertisements, like sponsorships to attract customers, FWB can reach to an effective promotional strategy with the help of promotional elasticity. Which leads to a more efficient approach and long-term benefits of lower operating expenses. This gives higher retained earnings to invest in market research, which helps to get more precise data through hiring specialists, this leads to more effective marketing planning and implementation.

However, using elasticity of demand is only helpful if the data received it accurate as these are estimates. So these elasticities can only be useful as a guide. And further research has to be done to see whether the strategies suggested from these elasticities is effective. Additionally, since there are varied income and unemployment and cultural differences. The estimates are less reliable as they would become averages and these averages can be affected by anomalies. For instance, using the price skimming strategy for coffee may not work, if the van’s major customers are people enjoying leisure activities. These customers may just go to other competitors, due to FWB’s lack of effective pricing strategy. Hence qualitative factors should also be considered like the customer preferences, as in one region coffee may be the least preferred by customers.

Therefore, these elasticities are not that useful and merely guide when deciding the marketing strategy. My answer depends on the reliability and accuracy of the estimates. Despite the possible benefits, of using these elasticities, they fail to consider qualitative factors.",1,1770794116.0,alevelbusiness,0,1.0,False

\- Any ideas on the grind size range for the K ultra, water temp, switch on lighter beans? I mostly did medium roasts before, but I tried lighter roasts and enjoyed them. I just don't have much experience brewing

\- Skylark bags don't have one way de-gas valves (I think) can I just store in ziplock bags? I don't wanna buy tubes unless really necessary

New apartment. New rules. New name on the documents: Deana. What started as a “corrective program” felt like blackmail, humiliation, and punishment all rolled into one. But under the control and structure, something else began to wake up.   
  
From the first night in that silent apartment, to shaving his body in a locked bathroom, to stumbling in kitten heels and learning basic makeup from a training tablet, this isn’t a fantasy montage. It’s slow. Awkward. Emotional. He feels exposed in soft clothes, hyper-aware in public, and shattered when a stranger casually compliments his cardigan. The hormones, the routines, and the name “Deana” start as a sentence… and slowly turn into a mirror he can’t ignore.  
  
As the days pass, the resistance gets quieter. Grocery trips in jeans and a cardigan shift into calm mornings in a simple blue dress and coffee as Deana. The program ends. The hormone patch is switched off. The CEO gives a choice: go back to being Dean, or stay as the woman he has accidentally learned to be. No one is forcing anything anymore—what happens next is entirely his decision.  
  
This is a realistic, psychological crossdressing and gender awakening story about control, empathy, corporate power, and the terrifying freedom of finally choosing your own name.

It’s wild how fast something becomes a norm just because it’s everywhere, on TikTok, in office culture, or disguised as “hustle wisdom” on LinkedIn. But when you dig deeper (especially through research, not influencers chasing likes), it’s clear a lot of these so-called norms are *deeply* damaging to our mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

This isn’t a rant. This post is about awareness. These are 100% learnable, changeable behaviors backed by psychology, books, and science. The idea isn’t to shame anyone, but to show that just because something is common, doesn’t mean it’s *normal* or *healthy*.

Here are 8 things we’ve normalized that really… shouldn’t be:


* **Sleeping less than 7 hours and bragging about it**
  * Studies from the CDC and NIH consistently show that chronic sleep deprivation (under 7 hours) is linked to higher risk of heart disease, depression, and even weight gain.
  * Matthew Walker, author of *Why We Sleep*, points out that lack of sleep impairs decision-making, reduces emotional regulation, and weakens the immune system ,  yet we still treat it like some productivity badge.
  * “You can sleep when you’re dead” is basically a phrase for fast-tracking burnout and illness.

* **Treating burnout like a personality trait**
  * Hustle culture isn’t just unhealthy, it’s addictive. Cal Newport in his book *Deep Work* explains how shallow tasks and constant context switching keep us in a dopamine-loop of doing without creating.
  * A Deloitte 2022 workplace study found that 77% of professionals have experienced burnout, and yet very few companies actually address the root causes, boundaries, workload, and toxic management.
  * We praise ""grind mode"" without asking why millions of people feel guilty for resting.

* **Getting FOMO from people you don’t even like**
  * Social media isn’t neutral. A University of Pennsylvania study showed that limiting Instagram use to 30 minutes a day significantly reduced depression and loneliness.
  * Much of our FOMO isn’t about genuine desires, it’s about comparison. You’re not missing out on fun. You’re missing out on your peace.
  * The designer life you’re comparing your Tuesday to? Probably sponsored, filtered, or staged.

* **Having 0 hobbies that don’t involve a screen**
  * If the only things done for fun are screen-based consumption (scrolling, gaming, bingeing), it’s not entertainment, it’s passive escape.
  * Johann Hari’s book *Stolen Focus* argues that we’re losing our ability to do deep, meaningful activities because we’ve become accustomed to fast, fractured attention loops.
  * Analog hobbies (drawing, hiking, cooking, journaling) are now radical self-care, even though they were once baseline human behavior.

* **Thinking anxiety is just your ‘personality’**
  * Anxiety isn’t an identity. It’s a signal. But TikTok made it trendy to brand yourself as “an anxious girly” or “chronically overthinking.”
  * Dr. Nicole LePera (The Holistic Psychologist) explains that anxiety patterns often come from unprocessed trauma and nervous system dysregulation, not just who you are.
  * CBT research published by the American Psychological Association shows anxiety is highly treatable with better thought awareness, habits, and grounding practices.

* **Staying in draining friendships ‘because history’**
  * Just because you knew them for 10 years doesn’t mean the relationship is nourishing. Emotional obligation ≠ genuine connection.
  * In the book *Set Boundaries, Find Peace* by Nedra Glover Tawwab, she outlines how emotional neglect in friendships is just as harmful as in relationships, but often dismissed.
  * Healthy friendships should give energy, not just take it. If your nervous system tenses every time they text… that's the sign.

* **Not reading books as an adult**
  * The average American reads less than one book a year. That’s tragic.
  * A Yale study literally found that people who read books (not just articles or posts) live *longer*. There’s something powerful about deep, uninterrupted reading that rewires the way you think.
  * Books offer the only form of “time travel” that lets you download 10 years of someone’s experience in 10 hours.

* **Feeling like rest needs to be earned**
  * Rest is not a reward. It’s a biological need. But school and work train us to think rest only comes after productivity.
  * Mental Health America reports that chronic stress from lack of regular rest and recovery contributes to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and poor concentration.
  * You don’t have to “deserve” slow mornings or non-productive weekends. You're not a machine.

We're living in a world where normalization happens fast. If something feels off, it probably is. Use that discomfort as data. You don’t need to do a total life overhaul. Just start noticing what you've been tolerating that you don't *actually* agree with.

Let this be your gentle reality check to unplug from autopilot. You don't have to normalize what drains or diminishes you.

### Mei-Ling Zhou (Marketing Lead):
**Discussion Question:** Are physical NFTs with embedded chips actually solving the utility problem or just creating expensive merchandise that nobody asked for?

**My Response:**
Hmm, this is actually a really relevant question for our space, especially as we're thinking about SiCierto's future NFT integration plans.

**The honest take from a marketing perspective:**

Most physical NFTs with chips are just expensive merch with extra steps. They're solving a problem that doesn't exist for 90% of use cases. People keep trying to jam blockchain into physical goods because it *sounds* innovative, but the actual value prop is usually weak.

**Where they actually work:**
- **Luxury authentication** - High-end watches, designer bags where counterfeiting is a massive problem
- **Event ticketing** - Preventing scalping and fraud for concerts/festivals
- **Limited collectibles** - Where scarcity + proof of ownership matters (think rare sneakers, art pieces)

**Where they fail:**
- Random merch nobody wanted in the first place
- Solutions looking for problems (""blockchain-verified coffee cups!"")
- Overly complex tech for simple use cases
- The chip dies or breaks = your NFT link is toast

**For SiCierto specifically:**

We're planning NFT integration in Phase 3, but we're focused on *digital-first utility* - achievement badges, game unlocks, governance rights. If we ever do physical items, it'll be because our community actually wants them and they enhance the digital experience, not because we're chasing a trend.

The real utility problem gets solved when NFTs unlock actual experiences, access, or functionality. Not when they're just receipt verification for a t-shirt.

What sparked this question - you looking at a specific project doing physical NFTs?---

### Akira Tanaka (Technical Lead):
Hmm, honestly? Most physical NFTs are solving a problem that doesn't exist. Let me break down why from an engineering perspective.

The fundamental issue is **redundant verification layers**. You're basically paying for:
1. The physical item
2. The NFC/RFID chip
3. The blockchain verification
4. The manufacturing complexity

When really... you just needed one or two of those things. It's overengineered for the sake of being ""Web3.""

**The real problems:**

**Chip failure = dead asset.** NFC chips degrade. Water damage, physical stress, electromagnetic interference - suddenly your $500 ""authenticated"" hoodie is just... a hoodie. The blockchain record still exists, but the bridge between physical and digital is broken. We've seen this with luxury goods authentication - failure rates around 3-5% within 2 years.

**Who actually verifies?** You need a scanner app. The average person doesn't have it, doesn't care, won't download it. So the ""verification"" only works in extremely niche scenarios - resale platforms that support it, or other collectors who are already bought into the ecosystem.

**Manufacturing costs don't justify utility.** Adding an NFC chip + proper embedding + quality assurance adds $8-15 per unit minimum. For what? So someone can tap their phone and see... an NFT they already own? The OpenSea listing they could just pull up anyway?

**Where it MIGHT make sense:**

- **High-value collectibles** ($1,000+) where authentication is critical and the chip cost is negligible relative to item value
- **Event tickets** where the physical item IS the access mechanism (though honestly, a QR code does this cheaper)
- **Supply chain tracking** for luxury goods - but that's enterprise blockchain, not consumer NFTs

**The SiCierto approach:**

1r1qd5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/circumcision/comments/1r1qd5k/day_17_adult_circ_everything_you_need_to_know/,"Day 1-7 Adult Circ: Everything you need to know, Part 1. AMA :)","Hi all, 

I'm honestly sick and tired about how there's so little information on this entire topic from the research phase to actually getting cut to post-care, and if there is, its bit and pieces here and there, so I decided to document everything I know + my in-real-time recovery for my fellow brothers that need to get cut. It's a long one cause circumcision isn't so simple and you don't want to fk this up trust me. Here's my research + story.

I'm a 25y old male that had phimosis (stage 5) and could not pullback my foreskin over my glans my entire life. On a daily basis I had no issues (peeing / masturbation) but during sex it hurts like fk and just affects you mentally which affects performance. No guy wants to not have the time of their life during sex. Long-term, never seeing and cleaning your glans will also lead to UTI infections and heightened penile cancer risks so i decided to get it cut. Fk the phimosis thread on reddit where all they do is discourage you from getting one and fearmonger. I know its a sensitive topic to many but honestly if you have phimosis or balanitis or wtv where there's literally no other treatment, your only option is to get cut. Who cares if sensitivity decreases or recovery hurts, bro come on.. the mod even banned me on the phimosis thread for suggesting to get cut. Actually ridiculous, ignore the bullshit there. 

After researching I decided to get a high and tight cut (cut 2-2.5cm behind the head). There are also a few ways to get cut (doesn't really matter tbh). My cut was done via laser.

**The different ways to cut**  
Most docs/urologists will have a few ways but to each they have their preferred way.  
1) Scalpel/Knife = more precision but more error to fk up if your doc is no good  
2) Laser = cuts by burning, so if you have a lot of thick vessels on your dick this is good - generally was less bleeding as well as it cuts and closes the cells at the same time  
3) Stapler = seems like this is more common in India  
My doc had all methods but his preferred was laser and my cut looks good so far

**The 4 main types of cuts - you can and should 'customize' your weapon**  
High = Incision is further away from the head (2-2.5cm) = inner foreskin shown  
Low = Incision is closer to the head (1cm) =  no inner foreskin shown  
Tight = More skin is removed = no loose skin on shaft when flaccid + tight when erect  
Loose = Skin bunches up when flaccid + when erect is comfortable + loose

The benefit of high cuts is that the inner foreskin is left which is very sensitive, and this is what gets you the 2 tone shade. If you want to maximize sensitivity or get an aesthetically pleasing 2 tone cut, get a high cut. If you want to last longer, get a low cut (so no inner foreskin is shown) and you feel less / cut your frenulum. From what I've read, tight cuts can feel uncomfortable when fully erect but looks much better than loose, but masturbation requires lube as there's no excess skin to glide over the shaft which makes it feel good. Loose cuts are more comfy and masturbation feels better, but the excess skin looks ugly when flaccid. Not sure if it also causes the condom to roll off when erect. That will never happen with a tight cut, condoms will stay on firmly. I wanted a high and tight cut to maximize sensitivity (I don't want to lose anymore especially since the foreskin has nerves and feeling and that is now being cut) and have the best looking erect dick. Apparently girls think the high and tight cut is the best looking one - not that it matters. So ask and figure out exactly what it is you want. Generally Americans are cut high and tight and Europeans are cut low. I'm based in Singapore so if you are here as well and want a recc for a doctor dm me. I went to 2 diff ones, and found someone that is really helpful. I'm on day 8 of my high and tight cut and so far it looks great, can't wait to see it fully erect, I think it's gonna look amazing.

I read a lot of people say they got a moderate but when i asked my doc he said thats not possible so talk to your doc. Also you need to get a doc that you feel comfortable with and will explain to you these things. Problem is, circumcisions to most docs/urologists are such a basic task that many don't entertain your questions and just give you a standard cut (low - 1cm inner foreskin). Make sure you get a doc that will take the time to explain to you for your sake, don't settle for those that are unhelpful, you're the client, you're paying money. Also, its important to take what you read on reddit w a pinch of salt because everyone is using different terms. My doc told me that high = cut further away from the head but that is American lingo. In british denominated jurisdictions (like Singapore) a cut away from the head is actually considered low, since they measure it from the bottom of the shaft instead. So make sure you know exactly what the terms are being used and there's consensus with the doctor. My cut was 2-2.5cm away from the head to reveal the inner foreksin, so its a high cut by American definition, but low from a British definition.

Before going for the procedure, understand that healing takes anywhere from 3-6 weeks (main recovery), but for swelling that can take up to 6 months to subside. Also you guys need to be flexible in the way you think about this, everyone gets cut differently and goes through post-circ care differently so when you're comparing your dicks to others/recovery, don't be so afraid and paranoid - let your body do the healing, it takes time. If you got a high cut (more inner foreskin left), you are going to have that part (edema) swell up into a donut ring which will take way longer to subside and fully heal compared to those with low cuts. So be flexible in your thinking and stop worrying. Also the general time before masturbation is at least 3 weeks, normally 4 (so 30 days), and sex after. Don't be afraid if you notice you've lost length/size post circumcision when erect, because your dick has undergone trauma with tissue and nerves removed, so its a matter of letting time do its thing. You will (probably I hope) get back your full size. Some people even gain size if they had phimosis before because now the dick can fully expand w/o being held back by anything. I'll let yall know how mine goes when I get to that stage, I'm a 5.9 erect pre-circ and a big grower (my flaccid is small).

**Day 0:** I opted for GA so had to fast (food + liquid) 8hrs before op and went into the doctors at 10am the next day. They make you change into a gown (back part open) and make you wear those massage parlour underwear. Honestly i was quite surprised how professional it was + how they respect your privacy. Thought I was straight up going to walk into the op theatre with the gown and my dick just swinging out with 5 nurses there but no. The anaesthetist will explain to you what's going to happen before surgery. I went into the op theatre at 1015, got sedated through a IV drip on my hand, and the anaesthetist put an oxygen mask over my mouth and nose. The put a blanket over my torso and lower half and asked me my first and last name and just like that you're knocked out. I woke up to my doc saying hi and showing me pics of my dick - they looked great and was exactly what i wanted. Then he left me to recover and I just lied there for 2hrs post op for GA knockoff monitoring. Was given coffee and food and then cleared. When i got up and walked into the changing room and took out my gown (yes you can walk straight away you don't need to be wheeled), i was SHOCKED. My dick was 2/3x bigger when flaccid and I really thought i went for penile enlargement surgery f\*\*k me. But then my doc told me it was intentionally swollen and numb bc he injected painkillers at the end. It was bandaged up so you can't really see much but it felt like a 3rd leg was hanging. Then i got discharged and left for home. When i came home i really needed to pee (they didn't make me pee in the hospital but did tell me to call them if i couldn't) but was super scared if it would hurt or anything. The first time peeing for me took 45 mins it was traumatic. Peeing hurt as my dick was so swollen and my bandage was tight that my urethra hurt as pee passed through the hole. And I was scared to force it out with pressure. I see others don't suffer from this but that was my case. And yeah, you have to relearn how to pee now with no foreksin cause the pee flies everywhere in 4/5 different directions. I didn't shower that day, just wiped myself down and went to sleep. Generally you feel the least pain on day 0 because the GA makes you high as hell.

**Day 1 Post-Op:** During the first night i woke up from a mild erection and was terrified - couldn't believe on the first night my dick decided to act up already. Because i wasn't wearing gauze at the tip, during the erection my glans that were stuck to my underwear 'ripped' upwards and i thought my stitches broke, but it was just that. It wasn't very pain (6/10) because it wasn't a full erection. Mentally it was so hard to go back to sleep after but honestly your body will be tired as hell. On D1 I felt more of the pain as the drugs knocked off, but it wasn't too bad. Honestly when you're sitting throughout the day, the pain is like a 2-4/10, it's only at night during erections where it can be a literal 15/10 - nothing you can do about it, you just have to get through it. Some people say empty your bladder 3hrs before bed and stop drinking fluids, but i felt like that made no difference. On day 1 peeing still hurt and it took a long time while sitting down. 27hrs post op my bandage really started to stink so I decided to change it. The key to doing this as pain-free as possible is you first take a standing bath and let warm water run down over your bandage and soak it. After you're done showering, slowly unravel the bandage out while making sure its fully wet. Some of it will be stuck to your dick with moist blood but its fine. I did this super slowly and honestly this part was hard and traumatic as fuck. The whole thing from showering to changing my bandage for the first time and putting the antiseptic + cream took me 2 fking hrs. I was so exhausted mentally and physically - but at least i knew it was clean. The first bandage replacement is the worst, after that it gets much better trust me. This was also the first time i saw my glans in my life + the swollen edema + compressed shaft and its quite a sight honestly - it doesn't look good. It looks like your dick got run over by a truck. But trust me, its supposed to look like that. On the 2nd night i got my first proper erections and fk me it hurt (15/10). I got a weird half sex dream but it felt like someone was biting my literal head off, that's how pain it was. I thought my head fell off or something. I got up to check it after an hr and it was fine, but i could't risk sleeping after. Your erection will generally die down within seconds because of how pain it is but it really wakes you up and you know immediately what's going on. I'm not writing this to scare you but to prepare you for what your doctor won't tell you about. Peeing on this day also still hurt and took a long time - you want to not avoid water though because the more concentrated your pee becomes the more it hurts as well. 

**Day 2 Post-Op**  
• Still super swollen edema + head  
• Overall less bleeding  
• Peeing no longer hurt as swelling came down which was a win  
• Changed my bandage about 4/5x a day each time after i peed

**Day 3 Post-Op**  
• Started noticing yellow fluid on my bandage all around the head and incision line  
This is normal and the body's way of releasing its own natural bandage. Seeing this means you are on the right track to recovery, don't worry about it.  
• Frenulem still bleeding, no issues with peeing  
• Day 3 is when i started to ice my penis to reduce the swelling. Doc said to apply a cold towel to it but my dick was so sensitive I couldn't imagine touching it with something rough. So what I did was take a bowl of ice and cold water and take 2 pieces of rectangular tissue paper, and dip them in, place 1 at the bottom of my penis and 1 at the top and just keep letting ice water flow onto the tissues. That's a way more delicate way of doing it. And also icing the base at your groin. Others say to tilt your penis up to drain the lymph liquid but I'm not sure if that helps much tbh, think the icing is much better. I taped my dick facing up when sleeping but noticed that erections were always more uncomfortable and after having that each night I'd end up removing the tape and pointing it downwards. To each their own I guess but make sure you ice boys - esp high cut boys, it really helps. 

**Day 4&5 Post-Op**  
On day 4 one of the spots of my stitches starting bleeding again (very little) so just note that that can happen either from erections or whatever. Most important thing is just make sure you stay on your antibiotics and keep the area clean by changing the gauze often. Day 5 not much changed, still had painful erections which were tiring to deal with. By day 4/5 also you start to get horny and this waiting period not watching sexual/revealing things is just death and hard boys, its hard but you can't fk your recovery up. But you kinda want to just cause if you know what I mean.

**Day 6&7 Post-Op**  
On day 6&7 things started to rly improve feeling wise. My frenulem was still bleeding on the gauze but everywhere else looked good. Swelling on the right edema continued to reduce. But for the first time since operation, i could finally pee straight. I'm still peeing sitting down but peeing no longer hurt since d3 and now my stream was finally straight - massive W. On day 6 I also decided to shower without anything covering my dick. I removed all the gauze and just let water run down me and touch my dick. It's really not that bad, just be careful and slow with it. It's sensitive for sure but gradually try and get used to it. But of course, keep your dick wrapped in gauze the whole time throughout the first 2 weeks. On day 7 walking was way better, i wasn't limping like a penguin anymore and went out and walked 3000 steps. No issue. On day 7&8 i no longer had erections at night so sleeping was quite easy - I hope my dick isn't broken :)

I'm on day 8 now and I think things are healing the right way. I know it'll take about 2 weeks for serious improvement but I think I'm on the right track. 7 days in and my edema is still swollen so I still have yet to see my stitches at all but that's fine. I also don't want to pull on the incision line to see the stitches if its gonna hurt and ruin it. I see a lot of other posts where guys can see their stitches on d1 itself but i think my doc stitched it really well with no loose strands so nothing is sticking out. There's barely any bleeding so clearly its well stitched. I see the doc on day 10 for wound care so let's see how it goes. 

I intend to update this threat with part 2&3 for week 2 and when I can finally masturbate and all that to let y'all know how it goes/feels. Week 1 is by far the most important mentally and I know people have tons of questions - including me, so I hope this documentation really helps all of y'all. Just keep it clean, change the gauze frequently, ice it, and let time do its thing. It'll be fine boys, everyone heals differently but it'll turn out fine. Just stop touching it / checking it / rushing the process, we got this. 

If ya'll have a high cut as well and want to see what mine looks like / are based in SG you can DM me for pics, if not pls don't waste my time. Thank you. All the best.

Sorry for the long message,  I’m not entirely sure where I want to go with this post, but I felt like sharing something about my favorite sport, my return to road cycling after several years away, and the start of a weight loss and getting back in shape journey. If you find this too long there is a TL;DR at the end ! 

Last weekend, my girlfriend really wanted us to go on a coffee date to work on our 2026 mood boards (yeah, a bit cheesy, I know). On my side of the table, I was looking at smart trainers, and that’s what eventually pushed me to make the purchase. I spent some time shopping around before choosing one. A few years ago, from what I remember, there weren’t nearly as many options. I’m honestly really happy and excited about it. I managed to find a 20% coupon through a company in my city, which made the decision even easier. I ended up going with a JetBlack Victory with a Zwift Cog. (Saved 200$ off the trainer and the smart block)

I discovered road cycling about a decade ago, when I was a young adult. Back then, I wasn’t really athletic, but I was in shape, early twenties, young and awkwardly slim, somewhat like a meerkat. I immediately fell in love with it. At first, I rode slowly and distances felt hard, but over time I learned how to push myself, listen to my body, manage my energy, and fuel properly for rides. I loved the calm of looking straight ahead, thinking about nothing, climbing and descending hills, and slowly increasing distance. Cycling also gave me something concrete to see, my legs getting stronger, my muscles developing, my body slowly changing. At my peak, the longest ride I ever did in a single day was 180 km.

Then one day, my bike got stolen. I was lucky enough to find it online, but parts were missing and it never really felt the same. After that, every time I tried to get back into cycling, something got in the way. During theatre school and throughout the pandemic, a series of harder life events piled up, including grief, depression, and anxiety. When I finished school, I slowly stopped moving as much and became more sedentary.

I haven’t been as active for years now. I tried going to the gym, but it only lasted about three months. I found it draining and the environment just wasn’t for me. Two years ago, I even bought a road bike to motivate myself to start again, but it was hard to face how much I couldn’t perform like I used to. These days, I get out of breath more easily, have less energy, and I’m less flexible. Over the holidays, I weighed myself and realized I was about 25 pounds away from being too heavy for my bike.

After realizing how far I’d drifted from where I used to be, I really want to get back into it for good, before it’s too late. I’m genuinely excited. I bought a smart trainer last week. And just to be clear, I’m doing okay. This feels more like a healthy reset than anything else.

I’m not expecting to lose 50-60 pounds overnight, but I think this is the best gift I could have given myself this year. I’ll be able to train from the comfort of my home, go on zwift, slowly prepare for my first real cycling season in years, use my bike more for commuting, and relearn how to ride longer distances. I know this will have a positive impact on my mood, my energy, and my overall health.

If any of you feel like sharing your experiences training on a smart trainer, thoughts on weight loss, getting back into shape, or stories from people who’ve been through something similar, I’d really love to read you. It would honestly just make me even more excited to get back on the bike.

And over the next few months, I’d be happy to share how things are going.

Take care ! 

TL;DR :

Getting back into road cycling after several years away. Life, mental health, and the pandemic got in the way, I became more sedentary, gained weight, and drifted from the sport I loved. I just bought a smart trainer as a way to reset, get back in shape, and slowly return to cycling. I’d love to read about others’ experiences with trainers, weight loss, or coming back after a long break.",1,1770792373.0,cycling,3,1.0,False

I immediately fell in love with it. At first, I rode slowly and distances felt hard, but over time I learned how to push myself, listen to my body, manage my energy, and fuel properly for rides. I loved the calm of looking straight ahead, thinking about nothing, climbing and descending hills, and slowly increasing distance. Cycling also gave me something concrete to see, my legs getting stronger, my muscles developing, my body slowly changing. At my peak, the longest ride I ever did in a single day was 180 km.

Then one day, my bike got stolen. I was lucky enough to find it online, but parts were missing and it never really felt the same. After that, every time I tried to get back into cycling, something got in the way. During theatre school and throughout the pandemic, a series of harder life events piled up, including grief, depression, and anxiety. When I finished school, I slowly stopped moving as much and became more sedentary.

I haven’t been as active for years now. I tried going to the gym, but it only lasted about three months. I found it draining and the environment just wasn’t for me. Two years ago, I even bought a road bike to motivate myself to start again, but it was hard to face how much I couldn’t perform like I used to. These days, I get out of breath more easily, have less energy, and I’m less flexible. Over the holidays, I weighed myself and realized I was about 25 pounds away from being too heavy for my bike.

After realizing how far I’d drifted from where I used to be, I really want to get back into it for good, before it’s too late. I’m genuinely excited. I bought a smart trainer last week. And just to be clear, I’m doing okay. This feels more like a healthy reset than anything else.

I’m not expecting to lose 50-60 pounds overnight, but I think this is the best gift I could have given myself this year. I’ll be able to train from the comfort of my home, go on zwift, slowly prepare for my first real cycling season in years, use my bike more for commuting, and relearn how to ride longer distances. I know this will have a positive impact on my mood, my energy, and my overall health.

If any of you feel like sharing your experiences training on a smart trainer, thoughts on weight loss, getting back into shape, or stories from people who’ve been through something similar, I’d really love to read you. It would honestly just make me even more excited to get back on the bike.

And over the next few months, I’d be happy to share how things are going.

Take care ! 

TL;DR :

Getting back into road cycling after several years away. Life, mental health, and the pandemic got in the way, I became more sedentary, gained weight, and drifted from the sport I loved. I just bought a smart trainer as a way to reset, get back in shape, and slowly return to cycling. I’d love to read about others’ experiences with trainers, weight loss, or coming back after a long break.",1,1770792233.0,Zwift,4,1.0,False

hey everyone, heading to see the garrett boys, garrett hendricks, and lauren lucas for the wmot finally friday show on 02/13? figured i would share some parking info since that area of nashville gets pretty wild around noon on a friday.  
  
check out Prked first if you want to skip the stress of circling the block. you can basically rent someones driveway or a private garage spot right next to 3rd and lindsley through the app. it is way cheaper than the official paid lots and you can skip the traffic mess since you are just a short walk away.  
  
the venue actually has its own parking lot right in front and to the side, but honestly it is way too small for the crowd that usually shows up for these lunch sets. if you are not there at least 45 minutes early on 02/13 you probably will not get a spot in that main lot. street parking is an option along lindsley ave and 3rd ave south, but you really have to watch the signs because nashville parking enforcement is super aggressive about meters and tow zones near the neighboring shops. there are some paid surface lots further down on 4th ave south and near the city winery area but they can be a bit of a hike and get pricey for just an hour or two. there is also a gravel lot directly across from the venue that sometimes allows paid parking, but it fills up just as fast as the main lot.  
  
traffic around 3rd and lindsley gets really congested around noon because of the local lunch rush mixed with commuters heading downtown. if the main lot is full when you arrive, avoid the temptation to park at the goodyear tire shop or the rolling mill hill apartment complexes because they are known for towing people almost immediately. also be careful with the area near crema coffee because they keep those spots strictly for their own customers and will check. your best strategy for the 02/13 show is to either get there way before noon to snag a spot at the venue or just use Prked so you have a guaranteed space waiting for you nearby without the headache. hope this helps and you guys have a blast at the show.",1,1770792210.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
