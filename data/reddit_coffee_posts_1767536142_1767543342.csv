University application fees are the biggest scam and i honestly don’t respect any university that does this sh\*t. like you make someone pay just to APPLY, then you reject them like nothing happened?? excuse me what exactly did i pay for then. the privilege of being told no?

Yeah yeah i know the argument already. oh they need resources to review applications, staff time, systems, blah blah. cool. that’s literally part of the business. that’s the cost of existing. a salesman drives to a potential client, burns gas, wastes time, maybe even pays for coffee, and guess what. if the client says no, the salesman doesn’t go back like hey can you reimburse my fuel pls. that’s how business works

what’s next honestly. application fee, then evaluation fee, then rejection processing fee. should i also pay for the admissions officer’s lunch while they skim my file for 15 minutes. maybe throw in oxygen fees since they breathed while reading my motivation letter

and the worst part is how normalized this bullshit is. like we’re supposed to accept it. some universities charge crazy amounts knowing damn well most applicants won’t get in. it’s literally monetizing rejection. peak greed brainrot

don’t get me wrong, if you admit the person, fine, whatever, still annoying but ok. but paying to get rejected feels insulting as hell. don’t call yourself an institution of ethics and knowledge while running a glorified lottery with a paywall.",2,1767543220.0,unpopularopinion,1,1.0,False

I'm working on huginn-proxy, a high-performance reverse proxy built in Rust that combines traditional reverse-proxy with fingerprinting capabilities. The project is still in early development but I'm excited to share it and get feedback from the community.  


What makes it different?

* Inspired by the best: Takes inspiration from \`r[ust-rpxy](https://github.com/junkurihara/rust-rpxy)\` and \`[sozu](https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu)\` for the proxy architecture
* Fingerprinting in Rust: Reimplements core fingerprinting logic from \`[fingerproxy](https://github.com/wi1dcard/fingerproxy)\`  (originally in Go) but in pure Rust
* Passive fingerprinting: Automatically extracts TLS (JA4) and HTTP/2 (Akamai) fingerprints using the \`huginn-net\` library
* Modern stack: Built on Tokio and Hyper for async performance
* Single binary: Easy deployment, Docker-ready

What I'm looking for:

* Feedback: What features would be most valuable? What's missing?
* Contributors: Anyone interested in helping with development, testing, or documentation? Coffee?
* Use cases: What scenarios would benefit from fingerprinting at the proxy level? I have created several issues in github to develop in the next few months. Maybe you have more ideas.
* Support if you see something interesting :) [https://github.com/biandratti/huginn-proxy](https://github.com/biandratti/huginn-proxy)

1q3tsip,https://tipstor.io/youre-missing-the-funniest-travel-marketing-trend/,You’re Missing the Funniest Travel Marketing Trend,"There is a strange, electric moment in modern travel culture when the seriousness finally cracks and humor comes spilling out like contraband. Somewhere between the gate delay and the third cup of airport coffee, the internet does what it does best. It laughs. This is where a travel business with a pulse can plant its flag, not in marble lobbies or glossy slogans, but in the shared joke that every traveler understands instantly. Launching a “Meme of the Week” contest is less a marketing tactic and more a public invitation to join the inside conversation.

This kind of content thrives on irreverence with affection. Travelers, food lovers, and armchair adventurers are already narrating their journeys through screenshots, captions, and badly cropped images loaded with personality. Inviting them to submit memes tied to a brand turns the audience into collaborators, comedians, and unofficial creative directors. The worse the pun, the better the engagement. A clever image paired with a groan-worthy line about missed flights, unforgettable meals, or that one spice that changed everything becomes instant social currency.

What makes this strategy powerful is its speed and adaptability. Memes ride trends in real time, bending toward whatever the internet is chewing on that week. A single contest submission can spark comment threads, duets, reposts, and stitches across platforms. Winners earn bragging rights, shoutouts, and maybe a small prize, but the real reward is visibility and belonging. The brand becomes a stage rather than a billboard, a place where creativity shows up wearing flip-flops and a grin.

For a travel business, this opens the door to an entire ecosystem of content. Weekly meme roundups become recurring posts. Top submissions can be featured in newsletters, turned into short-form videos, or woven into longer narrative pieces about travel culture and shared absurdity. Paired with behind-the-scenes clips, food stories, destination highlights, and quick travel tips, memes add a layer of relatability that polished content alone can never achieve. They humanize the brand without sacrificing expertise.

There’s also a quiet intelligence in celebrating humor. A company confident enough to laugh with its audience signals authenticity and cultural awareness. It understands that travel is as much about the stories that go sideways as the moments that go perfectly right. Food gets spilled, plans change, languages get tangled, and somehow those become the memories people cherish most. Memes capture that truth in a single frame.

By handing the microphone to its community, a travel brand transforms passive followers into active participants. The “Meme of the Week” contest becomes a ritual, a shared wink that says everyone’s in on the joke. In an industry built on movement, flavor, and discovery, this kind of playful storytelling doesn’t just attract attention, it builds loyalty. It turns a brand into a living, laughing archive of how travel really feels, one terrible pun at a time.

This is the first time I have ever had to do this in a drive thru and I just want to know if this is the new normal?  

I recognize that we are all just trying to make a living and I don’t fault the clerk for just trying to make more. But at what point do we draw the line? I don’t mind tipping for service but a drive thru? I would much prefer an establishment pay their people well and just increase the price of what I’m buying. 

Are we to just all adopt this practice and start asking for a tip for just interacting with someone?? 🥴

1q3tpdu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3tpdu,Tips to raise the bar?,"I'm looking to upgrade and complete my bar a bit with a few bottle swaps or additions.  
I'm curious what you guys would suggest! I know I'm missing some stapples and that the drinks probably look like shit as of right now, but bear with me, I'm just getting started.  

Here's the list, with my comments and questions.  


*Gin*.  
- Ki no Bi Dry (great gin with character, I don't plan on swapping it out).  


*Vodka*.  
- Psycho Love (Japanese, 33%, technically not a vodka... I'm thinking to get a bottle of Haku perhaps, but I'm open to suggestions for a better unflavored vodka).  
→ Any good, smooth, real vodka?  


*Rum*.  
- Myer’s Rum Original Dark (yeah... sorry I cook crepes with it, I wish I had something better for a dark rum, probs one of the swaps I should do soon. Any ideas?).  
- Appleton Estate 12 years (I love this bottle).  
→ any suggestions for a good white rum?  


*Bourbon*. 
- Widow Jane Decadence. (I don't know what I'll do when this one runs out. This is such a sweet and pleasant bourbon, it tastes like dessert on its own. I love it).  


*Whisky*.  
(I fancy my whiskys most. I also have a bottle of Chichibu, but I only sip that one neat).  
- Ichiro’s World (teh workhorse).  
- Ichiro’s World Red. (Red wine cask, gives me a good pairing for sweeter/wine based drinks. Pricy, so I don't use it everyday).  
- Mars Maltage Cosmo. (A gift to be sure, but a welcome one. Not much to see here).  
- Akkeshi Peated (my precious. Awesome sipper and the only peated I have atm.).  
- Ninkasi (French. Not opened yet, I'm waiting to finish the Cosmo first).  


*Scotch*.  
- Old Perth the Original (a decent, solid scotch... The bottle broke and I had to rescue it with a near empty bottle of cosmo I finished in a hurry. I'd love to get some Arran single malt to complement that part of the shelf).  


*Tequila*.  
- Casco Viejo Reposado. (The only non jose cuervo tequila I found at the store... I have decided to order online from now on.  
I want to get a nicer one next time around and am considering a fortaleza reposado. Any suggestions? I love to sip tequila neat too, but was very disappointed with the Casco Viejo).  
→ tequila-sensei, please teach me!  


*Shochu*.  
- Ikki (awesome to drink by itself, a bit too subdued for cocktails).    
- Hyakunen no Kodoku (almost a whisky. My favorite, it's so awesome tasting and cool, I know I'll keep stocking this one).  
- Aqua (traditional). (A really powerful taste, I'm curious to use it in a recipe soon).  
- Kurousagi (similar to ikki but sweeter and stronger, awesome too.).  
→ Any good shochu cocktail recipe I could try to use that Aqua?  


*Nihonshu*.  
- Hinotori.  (Such an awesome sake... Such a shame I wont ever find that bottle again. It's almost empty too).  
- Kamekuchishu (Actually this one is alright but not much to say).  
- Kimoto Tsukuri Junmaishu (more of a mariage sake to eat seafood with. But I'm sure it would combo well for a clear, sharp-tasting something. Any ideas?).  


*Umeshu*.  
- Chita (solid, a bit boring... I'll probably upgrade for a 100nen umeshu at some point).  
- Okagesama Nigoriume (a very sweet one, almost like syrup. I do like it and it's perfect for cocktails).  


*Absinthe*.  
- Absente 55 (god I dislike that bottle... I'm so impatient to get my ass to Europe and grab something better. Anything.).  


*Vermouth*.  
- Martini Rosso ( I use it for cooking. But in that negroni, I was a bit disappointed with it. It got completely outshone by the Ki no Bi. I've seen the Cocchi di Torino praised to the moon, should I get it?).  
- Noilly Prat Dry (another one I haven't tried out yet).  
→ What sweet vermouth upgrade should I get?  


*Liqueurs / Aperitifs*.  
- Campari. (It's Campari. It's red.).  
- Pierre Ferrand Curaçao (hesitated lots with Cointreau. Eventually chose that one, since I've got lots of more nuanced-tasting stuff, and the straight in your face profile of Cointreau would feel a bit out of place).  
- Lillet Blanc (because, yes, I too must make a Vesper at some point).  
→ I guess my largest blindspot is in this category. What should I get in priority to ""unlock"" more drinks/ taste profiles? I was thinking amaretto? Kahlua perhaps?


*Bitters*.  
Angostura Bitters.  (I chose those in priority over Peychaud since I can always get the anise taste from my shitty absinthe).  
Yuzu Bitters.  (Felt right at home with the rest of my Japanese bottles).  


Additions I'm considering.  
→ a Chartreuse Verte. Just need to find it...  
→ a cognac or armagnac as brandy. Seems like a big blind spot. Any good ones?  
→ Amaretto?  Frangelico? I have no nutty liqueur... Also I need orgeat if I'm ever to make a mai tai.  
→ Kahlua? Or a different coffee liqueur? I have a good coffee French press, so I don't now how urgent that is.  


In the pictures.  
- Saketini (Ki no Bi, Hinotori and Psycho Love. Very subdued soft-hitter due to the low proof. Enjoyed it a lot.).  
- Hot Toddy (Widow Jane, dark honey, lemon juice, with a short infusion of grated ginger and houjicha. I should have used fresh lemon juice but I ran out of lemons. When life gives you bottled lemon juice, make a hot toddy with it).  
- Negroni (Ki no Bi, Campari, Martini Rosso. Tasted fine but the vermouth was nowhere to be seen. I wish I had larger ice too).  
- Daiquiri (Appleton, lime, syrup. Tasted better than it looks. Made me want to get a propper white rum).  ",1,1767542876.0,cocktails,2,1.0,False

My baby (13 months) just doesn’t really like food. I don’t think he ever has. I did the whole BLW thing in the beginning and he’d try a lot of food and consume next to nothing. Tried over a hundred foods- the only things he really likes are snacks and Greek yogurt. And my boobs. 

Added in spoon fed porridge as the number of meals increased which went down well. I’d say up til about 11 months he’d eat most things. Then he started getting pickier and pickier and things he liked he now won’t touch (fish, vegetables, fruits). Suddenly everything has to be hidden and bland. Except snacks. He’ll devour cheese, baby biscuits, any thing from Organix. 

He also refuses point blank to be fed by a spoon now- which is adding a new layer of difficulty because 9 times out of 10 he’ll scream murder when you put him in a the high chair. So I end up having to make self feeding foods and then basically scatter them around my house (on coffee table etc) so that he’ll eat them. He is a very very active baby. Does not stop. 

This has all come to a head while we’re on holiday without a high chair. Eating at restaurants is a no-go unless one of sits and eats while the other one takes him outside, or we employ miss rachael, which I’m really trying not to do. He definitely won’t eat at a restaurant either. Out of the 10 meals we’ve had out he ate at one. To the point that we’ve changed hotels to one with a kitchen to cook there and not bother trying to eat out. But also won’t eat porridge in the morning (spoon fed) - wants to feed himself but will immediately put his fist in the food and then his hair. 

It was all made worse at the 1y appointment when the paediatrician said he’d dropped 10 percentiles in 2 months and that he needed more food (didn’t lose weight, just percentiles). This was off the back of two winter colds and three new teeth though. Before that I was pretty chill with ‘he’ll eat what he needs to, my job is to offer food and his job is to eat it’ etc 

Since that appointment last month I’ve lost my head a bit. In a bid to get him to eat more I end up making him 3-4 different options— I’ll start with something like fish cakes, meat, fruits, etc and slowly move towards the things I know he will eat (bloody baby biscuits) and I’ve also let him on the boob more. But none of this is sustainable and I think I’m making it worse - like will he just be thinking ‘if I throw the fish cakes I’ll eventually end up with biscuits and milk’? Or are we too young for that thought process? Because I’m starting to think he eats less actual solids now than he did before the paediatrician told me to push him to eat more, and he definitely drinks more milk than a month ago. 

Any and all wisdom is welcome. 🙏

The evenings of Day 1,2,3,5,7 will all be spent in Hanoi, and as my traveling companion must eat Halal food, we might end up eating at the same restaurants. 

Also it's made booking hotels a little awkward, and I'm now thinking I'll just book an airbnb in Hanoi for the whole week.



The solution I'm considering is going to Ninh Binh in the afternoon/evening of the 2nd day so we spend the night there. And/or taking the bus straight from Ninh Binh to Sa Pa rather than stopping in Hanoi first. This does however shorten our first day in Hanoi.

I’m 29, based in Noida. 6 ft, \~90 kg, reasonably fit, reasonably good-looking, and doing well enough in life that my EMI texts no longer give me anxiety. I’m self-made, career-focused, and earn around 5L/month - mentioned only because Reddit hates mysteries.

I’m really into **motorsport** — track days, fast cars, long drives, and arguing about racing lines like it’s a personality trait. If you enjoy road trips, playlists, or just sitting passenger while pretending not to judge my driving, we’ll get along.

What am I looking for?  
Genuine **friendship and companionship**. Someone to talk to, grab coffee, explore cafés, go on drives, or just decompress after adulting all day. If the vibes are elite and mutual, I’m open to seeing where it naturally goes. No rush, no pressure.

Important disclaimers (read like terms & conditions):  
• I’m respectful, emotionally sorted, and drama-averse  
• This is not a “please feel sorry for me” post - life’s good, just looking to share it  
• If we meet, **all expenses are on me** (I like planning and I hate bill-splitting math)  
• For safety and sanity, I’ll only reply to DMs that include a **LinkedIn profile** \- I’ll share mine too, so it’s mutual and not sketchy

If you’re in or around Noida, enjoy good conversations, don’t mind occasional car talk, and prefer real-world meets over endless “lol” texts, drop a DM with a short intro - age, area, and one thing you genuinely enjoy.

Worst case: we chat and part ways.  
Best case: great company, good memories, and maybe a co-pilot for future drives.

Usually I have one, maybe two coffees per day. And I know it seems obvious, but I just never considered they would have such an effect. Since my diagnosis I think there’s definitely a prideful ego thing as well that I cannot accept “normal“ things would perhaps be something I cannot do. Those of us with cptsd are not the same as everyone else and it’s taken me a long time to really get that through my head but eventually I’ve stopped smoking, stopped recreational drugs, stopped bad diets and rarely drink now.

What's especially helpful is being able to set a grind size and see how the settings translate across common grinders.

To this end, I wanted to learn if people have any thoughts regarding how accurate the info is on the app? Are the range of grinders/particle size well represented? Are the range of grind sizes accurate to some extent?

Follow up question regarding the 1zpresso ZP6. I also have a Kingrinder K6 and at a mode particle size of 453um, it translates to around 60 clicks which is what I have always used and like the resulting brew.

For the ZP6 however, the same grind size translates to ~ 3 clicks on the app's scale which is befuddling to me. I have always set the ZP6 between 40-50clicks (between 4 and 5 on the grinder) and resulted in very nice brews that the ZP6 is famous for. By the app, this translated to a grind size ~1000um.

 If that's true, I no longer understand how coffee works and my mind is broken. Help me.

TLDR: CoffeeOS app is helpful but ZP6 scale doesn't make sense.

This time you're not yelling at me from the other side of the door. I have a new life now. It's been a year and some change away from your draining anger.
I'm watching you from a poorly disguised account. Curious and terrified. To see your face so different and grotesque. Hearing your voice so imperceptibly sour in a new cadence. Almost as though you're wearing a curated design, an invisible jacket to puppet for the new people you haven't hurt yet.
I ask myself how I didn't notice. I ask myself what did I ever see in you. The answer that I've since learned is: I saw nothing in you but myself reflected. I was probably thinking you understood pain and you might know how hard it was to create from agony. 
You didn't. Truth be told after the ego blow of your main supply leaving there's a large chance you never will.
 I feel bad for you. I don't want to because I actually really hate your rotten guts. I'm not really a terrible person, even after all you've done to me, so I still have empathy I guess. I want you to become better, to do better for the next victim of your abuse. I want you to see yourself for who you are and to think maybe you're not a gift to women, maybe to realize you're just many women's lessons. The lessons of ‘actually, no. I don't deserve this, and I am better than you, and I need more than you barely provide.’ 

You wear big hideous aviator sunglasses regularly now. The eyes never lie. People were starting to notice weren't they? People were asking questions. ‘Whatever happened to her? How are you doing? Sorry for your loss.’ You always did hate sympathy, unless of course there was something in it for you afterwards. Even if a good ‘friend’ gave you support by any means you were keen first on taking it to your rank apartment and judging it, complaining about the gift from all angles.

That apartment I called home for too many lost years. The rotted out corpse of all my tireless toil and meticulous design. The effort unimaginable I had to muster to make living with a demon possessed skeleton even somewhat comfortable. I digress.

I'm watching the parade online, ‘All is well!!’ ,you say. ‘I am currently working on my grand opus. I have no clue and no desire. Care to join me?’ I can imagine less and less people having the care to be near you. I feel you. You stay up late, like I did tonight. You stare into a screen and fume. You glare at the empty refrigerator, at the empty beer bottles littering the countertop. You don't bother looking into the empty pantry. Walking past the full trashcan and dirty dishes. You head thru the un-vaccumed living room and down the unswept hallway. On the right hand side is the coat closet filled with a few strands of memories of my life there. Thinking to yourself, ‘I need to sell her jackets, surely they're worth something.’ Muttering to nobody in particular about how I used to laugh at that stupid purple coat. You pass the moldy bathroom. I can see you stand with your dry unkempt hair and your poor posture in front of the bedroom doorway. The dark black room is devoid of any light because you demanded it to be that way. You stare into the void. ‘WHY’ You say out loud. The sound of your own voice breaks the silence, the voices in your head stop only long enough to hear the question and continue chattering behind your ears.
You mutter a curse and turn away from the bedroom and stomp heavily over squeaking floorboards into the “office” really just catch all ‘dragon hoard’ of various garbage, broken memories, failed business ideas, unsold band merchandise, empty boxes and some shoddy IKEA furniture. Shelves filled with books you've never read. The incense of burnt money, stale beer and cheap weed hangs in the air. You scrape together the last of your sighs and open the portal of social media yet another time. No new likes… nobody cares. Sadness, you think of how I left you. “How could she? She owes me!! I'll show her!!” 
I sit here on my new couch in my house with people I love around me and I laugh at you. All you ever have or will show me, is how hard you are to love. I should've believed you the first time you told me that. I used to care, I don't care anymore. You should be praying you never see me again, because God help me if I ever see your punchable face again. I wouldn't hurt you, I'm a good person. I would think about you calling me names and screaming and throwing things. Tearing up my clothes and generally destroying my life. I would look you in the eye. I'd hope you had those cheap sunglasses on, I would earnestly ask you to please take them off before me. I would stare into your sad, dead, evil, broken eyes. Just when you begin to think I might apologize, I'll smile and without a word, leave you standing alone once again. You stupid sad mother effer.

**Let's recap!**

**Episode 26**

**Shuangyuan PV Office:** 

[I also try to have fun at work so I feel like I am getting paid to play around. \(at least in the rare times I can\)](https://preview.redd.it/mw9l0zhrocbg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd4eddacb73e09332fff3e9fad62c7a62e864d38)

Episode starts with Yin Jie in fangirl shipping mode as she encourages Xigua to continue pursuing her office romance. She also asks her about the previously cancelled dinner invitation and Xigua answers that Yusen is treating them tonight as he is going on another business trip tomorrow. 

We switch to Yusen talking his plans for Phase II Plant with **Mr Zhang in his office.** His project ideas are a big deal as Zhang is all fired up. *I wonder if this will eventually stir up the jealousy of his family again? If they will try to handle him the way they handled his father.* 

**Food Time With the Work Besties**

The dinner plans are finally in progress, as Yusen treats Xigua and the squad to dinner, telling them to go all out with the ordering as he is indeed here as Xigua’s boyfriend and not their boss. Yin Jie is the happiest with this arrangement.

[I identify as a Yin Jie](https://i.redd.it/l55gj115pcbg1.gif)

**After the meal**, Yusen drives them back, with Yin Jie rushing to drag Yuhua away to give the couple their alone time. It is raining, so Yuhua worries about Xigua being without an umbrella, but YJ just tells her not to  worry about it. Naturally, Yusen gets down first, grabs an umbrella and opens the door for Xigua. He walks her to the door *their steps once again synced!* As Xigua keeps adjusting the umbrella to cover all of Yusen too and not just her.

He walks her to the door and apologises for having to go on a trip so soon after going official, she tells him not to be sorry and jokes about how he is making her money since she’ll inherit 49% of the shares. He takes the opportunity to ask for a business trip perk. 

[I loVE FOREHEAD KISSES, THEY ARE THE CUTEST, I AM MELTING AT HOW SOFT THE MOMENT WAS. ](https://preview.redd.it/y5kz3u4cpcbg1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=7170139d5869903c655872df1d1a97b4ec24a8f9)

**Next morning, Yusen arrives at Guangzhou** 

**Shuangyuan PV:** Xigua is in a meeting and we her now completely comfortable with all the business dealings that overwhelmed her at the start. She goes all serious as she gets a report on the quotes of the material needed for the Liuguang Garden. 

**Xiguang is eating and Yusen is on a car ride.** They exchange pictures of their lunch, and Xiguang vents out her discouragmenet at the prices, and how she feels like she is going nowhere with on-market price comparisons. Yusen encourages her, reminding her of the important of the price comparison.

**Xiguang’s Dorm:** 

Xiguang hears a notification ding and she rushes to check her phone to find 

[I will try to put together Lin Yusen's resume later for fun! ](https://preview.redd.it/8fkm002spcbg1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=49f88035c7ebde4129e09f0d15bd85633caf4341)

Yusen clarifies that his dating history was just something he was dragged to by his professor, that he can re-edit the resume and resend it to her. She teases him about it and he says he will just give that experience to Sheng Yi. Xigua sends him her resume too, but he says ‘I’ve already seen yours’ Xiguang is curious about when but he doesn’t clarify further. (It was during the job fair in the early eps). Yusen adds that he already knows more about her than what her CV might state “i know my target customer wants millet congee and fried jiaozi from the cafeteria in the morning.” and Xiguang is ‘fake’ worried about him having figured out her eating habits. 

*This whole conversation was just fluff. I have yet to stop smiling since this episode started.* 

**Xiguang’s Dorm: Morning** She wakes up to Yusen’s good morning message. 

***Xiguang Inner Thoughts: Is this what being in a relationship is like? The first thing I do when I wake up is look for a good morning message. I want to tell him everything I’m doing, and I want to know what he’s up to, too. Suddenly, there’s this person in my life who feels closer than anyone else. He’s there every single moment. He occupies my thoughts more than anyone ever has.*** 

Xiguang sits down for coffee, looks at the cv again and texts Yusen about how his name is all wood. (the characters for both Lin and Sen are related to forests) Yusen replies that all that wood needs sunlight, Xiguang answers “All that wood is just waiting for a little morning glow?” (Xiguang means morning glow) 

[His last messages makes her smile as wide as I do. ](https://i.redd.it/146260fzpcbg1.gif)

**Shuangyuan PV Office:** 

Xiguang is still worried and working on getting good materials for a good price. Her colleagues worry about the future of their jobs, and she says they have nothing to worry about since they’re expanding. She smiles and then leaves the office. Auntie Jiang calls asking about her latest relationship status. They gossip a bit, then auntie tells her about the upcoming banquet, asks her if she is going with Lin, to which Xigua says no, then tells her about how they are competing against Shengyuan (Chengyuan’s company)  for a bidding on a small digital product. *I wonder if this bidding thing will come back later, possibly to slap Chengyuan in the face please??*

**Xiguang at the Supermarket/ Yusen at a hotel**

Xiguang texts Yusen about how her uncle is going to his grandpa’s banquet. Yusen calls her and says ‘I will make sure to greet uncle when I see him then’, they joke about him calling Uncle Jiang uncle, then Yusen explains how the banquet is a big deal because his grandpa might announce his heir. Xiguang said maybe they will finally stop targeting you then. Yusen apologizes about being unable to make it back on Saturday morning, and how he still has some negotiations to do. Xiguang said she’d love to see him negotiate deals.

[This conversation has me so happy, the both of them smiling and grinning and talking back to each other. The more he indulges her, the more playful she gets. I am smiling still! ](https://reddit.com/link/1q3tghe/video/elymh3pbucbg1/player)

Yusen says he’ll be back by Saturday night by 1 A,M , Xiguang is worried about him pushing himself so hard going from the banquet in Shanghai and rushing back to Suzhou. She asks him if he has something urgent at work? He replies that “I have been away from my girlfriend for too long. I want to take her to Tongdexing for breakfast on Sunday”. 

[Yin Jie is represents how annoying i get when my friends get into a relationship. ](https://i.redd.it/arya3f6aqcbg1.gif)

Xiguang thinks back to how her uncle is going to the banquet and texts her mom that she’d like to accompany him. 

*I love how she takes the initiatives now to go surprise him. She did so at the train station and now she is doing the same for the banquet.*

**Grandfather Sheng’s Birthday Banquet**

A Mr Zeng greets them at the door. Uncle Jiang introduces Xiguang as his niece. Zeng wonders about Mr Nie’s schedule and Uncle Jiang smoothly replies that ‘I don’t really know Mr Nie’s schedule” , he said it all smiley with a tone that felt to me as warning for the subject to drop. Zeng welcomes them inside. 

Zeng leads Xiguang and Uncle around, taking the time to pointing out all the different Sheng family members. Yusen has three uncles, Bokai (Chengyuan’s friend), Zhongkai, and Shukai. 

https://preview.redd.it/92u87bp8ucbg1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b9a92e0f63c985920e71846469054cdf9770e04

Uncle Jiang goes around the party, greeting who he knows and boasting about Xiguang’s academic achievement. *I love how the uncle is being protective of her, but at the same time just looking so delighted at the fact that she attended the banquet with him. Xiguang is truly blessed with her family.* 

They meet Bokai and his wife, who tries to subtly hint at her meeting up Xingjie to get to know each other. Xiguang zones out of the conversation, her eyes looking for her man. Summoned by her thought, we see Yusen walking in. 

Before she decides however, Old Sheng makes an entrance. Zeng and Uncle Jiang gossip about Old Sheng passing the torch to Xingjie. Just as we see Xinjie raise his wine glass towards Yusen in a toast, Yusen the good-mannered kid that he is reciprocates but *THIS ASS OH MY GOD everyone keeps competing for my most hated SOM character* Xingjie doesn’t drink from the glass he toasted with, putting it back on the tray and picking up another one. Uncle Jiang is not impressed with Xingjie’s mannerisms and Xiguang even less so.

***Xiguang’s Inner Thoughts: if it weren’t for that car accident, Yusen would still be a top neurosurgeon; he wouldn’t be standing here, being the subject of everyone’s pity and gossip.*** 

Seething, Xiguang decides it is finally the moment to go to to Lin Yusen.

https://i.redd.it/2tm7prrhqcbg1.gif

*My girl, going to shine a light on him, She is one of the most eligible bachelorettes at that party, going to the guy everyone was gossiping about! get  your man. I am laughing so hard at Uncle Jiang taking pictures for his wife for money. The fact that she is paying him 200 per photo. Auntie Jiang is an older Yin Jie.* 

Yusen greets Uncle Jiang as ‘Uncle’ . Zeng is surprised that they know each other and says sorry if his words caused any offense. The trio head to greet Old Sheng. Yusen introduces Xiguang as his **girlfriend**. Old Sheng is happy about their relationship and invites them over for a meal. Old Sheng leaves, and Yusen excuses himself and Xiguang to go out for some fresh air.

[They are such a power couple !!!! ](https://i.redd.it/kde866glqcbg1.gif)

**Episode 27**

**Empty Banquet Hall**

We start off with our couple walking out into a different banquet hall, except this one is empty. Xiguang complains about never being so high profile, that everyone was looking at her and Yusen just replies that they were looks of envy. They come to a stop in front of a gorgeous night view, Xiguang is taken by the view and Yusen is taken by her. He stares at her for a while and then reaches out….

[Yessss my darlings. It speaks to just how emotionally overwhelmed Yusen is that he kissed her without prior notice. ](https://i.redd.it/k4pttjd2ucbg1.gif)

He whispers to her “thank you for picking me up”. Xiguang is all shy smiles. He tells her not to worry about him, that he doesn’t care about that place anymore (the whole Shengs heirship fight) his eyes are on her as he says “my heart isn’t in it anymore”. He further adds that once the Shuangyuan business is done, he is going back to medicine. *LET’S GO, DR LIN YUSEN WILL BE BACK IN THE HOUSE. I am happy he wants to go back because we’ve seen so clearly how much of a doctor he is at heart.* 

Xiguang tells him that she knew that sooner or later he would go back to medicine. 

**Banquet is over! : Uncle and Xiguang Driving Back Home**

Uncle Jiang  is complaining to his wife about Xiguang ditching him to catch a ride back from Shanghai with Yusen. Auntie Jiang accuses him of being salty. *They act all parental with Xiguang and I am living for it. Xiguang has two moms, a dad and a brother and they all love and care for her so unconditionally.* We learn that Xiguang has made plans to further hang out with Yusen tonight. 

**Beijing Avenue: Walk time**

Yusen meets Xiguang at her hotel. She comes up to him all excited and they decide to go for a walk on Beijing Avenue. Xiguang complains about having to make toasts at the banquet all the time, then ask Yusen how come he doesn’t look like he’s been drinking?. Yusen replies that he deliberately let everyone think he is a lightweight. Xiguang reminds him of the time he made her drink back at his friend’s wedding. Yusen tells her that from now on, he’ll drink for her at every wedding. 

https://i.redd.it/m6o92hxutcbg1.gif

They smile *as I do watching them, and then my smile quickly turns to a wider grin as* Yusen touches her face, asks if she is cold then hugs her within his coat!!! 

[Such a cute moment I am giggling and grinning like an idiot !!! . ](https://preview.redd.it/plaa321vrcbg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3eac313ba5deb6e5bc0b8ad1e2efd14d00f275a7)

Yusen says, “I have a bold suggestion.”, he invites her to his house, promising to get her back home on time. She jokes about how his ‘humble abode’ might be as cold as the outside, he says, but the host is warm, she asks how warm? And he just gives her a look that she ends up all embarrassed. He entices her by pastries from Guangzhou, and old pictures of him she mentioned wanting to see. She agrees and they both rush home.

**Yusen’s House**

Xiguang looks at the pastries and decides she wants to see the pictures first. The picture turns out to be just one singular one from when he was a student. Yusen promises to show her the album at his grandparents’ place next time. She finds an old schedule of his from med school, and he tells her that originally he was going to apply for business school. He says it’s a long story, ‘do you want to hear it from me?’ and she replies only if he wants to tell her. He says that “I want to tell you everything about myself.”

*This is so sweet, because we all know Xiguang is a curious cat but she still won’t press anything that might make him pressured. The fact that he wants to lay his story bare to her is just as touching, because these are no doubts painful memories, so it must feel nice to find someone he can confide in.* 

Yusen takes his time telling her his [backstory](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1q3tghe/comment/nxn8abt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (I’ll post the full monologue in a comment) and we learn that someone deliberately let slip the news about his dad to him right before gaokao, causing him to change his major. How he kept his distance from the Shengs. Eventually, after the accident, he joins Shuangyuan, excels in his role, and becomes recognized as a talented business professional.

>“***... I went to suzhou and then I got to know you all over again. And my whole world shifter. It’s like my sanity finally returned, perhaps I’ve been made whole again. My mind is finally at peace. I asked myself if it was worth spending so much time on things just to make others miserable. Of course, at the time I thought it was because I was being dramatic feeling like I had nothing left to lose. But now, I have so much to live for. Xiguang, I don’t want to give up. I don’t want over ten years worth of hardwork to go down the drain. “***

*I am so happy we got more of his thoughts, that his trip to the deserts actually helped him. It continued the trend of our main characters being mature individuals who are constantly reflecting on themselves.*

He talks about how the help he provided at Taichi Hospital (Kevin’s case) reminded him of the sense of fulfilment he got a a doctor that the found no one else, and how the trip to the Northwest reminded him that there is more to being a doctor than surgical trials. “Isn;t my brain my most valuable asset”

[Xiguang said \\""You’re incredibly strong and amazing. \\""](https://i.redd.it/z1kknc6ntcbg1.gif)

**Out of Yusen’s house, on a walk:** 

Xiguang is happily swinging her bag, excited that Yusen is going back to medicine. She says that she is tired of CEOs anyways and would prefer having a doctor for a boyfriend. She asks him about what he plans to be? He tells her that an old professor of his is back in Shanghai and offered to meet with him to discuss him the possibility of joining her research team on Brain-Computer Interface.  Xiguang is excited for him and Yusen is also looking very hopeful about his path. 

**Sheng’s House:** Old Sheng is scolding Bokai and his wife for their son’s behavior at the banquet. And asks his butler to have Yusen come over the next day. 

**Yusen and Xiguang In Front of the Hotel:** 

The two of them are deciding what to do, when Yusen gets a call from Mr Li. Old Sheng is angry and has asked for Yusen to head back to him. He drives Xiguang to the plaza to hang out, promising to pick her up later. Right before she gets off however 

https://reddit.com/link/1q3tghe/video/cnspalustcbg1/player

**Old Sheng’s House**

His other cousins greet him at the door, proud of their parents for snitching on Xingjie. They ask him about wanting to meet his girlfriend and he says later.*I am glad some of his family members seem decent enough.*  Yusen walks in, sits down and talks about his recent business trips with his grandfather. Grandpa is proud of him. He tells him of his plans to hand over all of Shuangyuan’s shares to Yusen after Mr Zhang retires. Yusen communicates that he wants to go back to the medicine field after the Shuangyuan business is settled. Grandpa tells him that it doesn’t matter, he can sell the shares for all he cares. Yusen tries to protest but the grandpa is firm in his decision. 

We see Yusen pick up Xiguang. *I love how he was feeling so conflicted and tired but the moment he saw her, his eyes lit up.* 

**Bokai’s Office, Chengyuan’s Room**

We cut from our lovely couple, to see Bokai call Chengyuan to complain about how his daughter is backing up ‘my nephew’, how they were the talk of the town. Chengyuan is surprised to learn of all of this. Bokai complains about how. Yusen approached Xiguang just for her family. *Not everyone is as greedy as you dumbasses.* 

Bokai talks about how Chengyuan’s plans to sell the Shuangyuan Plant are no longer possible because the new shareholder now is Yusen. “It looks like a done deal unless you block it.” *Leave my boy alone, omg what miserable old men.*

Bokai also mentions a Fenteng digital corner, and asks if Chengyuan is interested in it. (remember, it is the one Aunt Jiang said they’re bidding on) Bokai says that Xingjie is involved in the project, and he would appreciate Chengyuan’s help in paving the way and he says “Just put together a team to help him win the bid.” Chengyuan says we’ll see and hangs up. 

QFP walks into the room. Sweet talks Chengyuan and babies him, then talks about how she’s been scolding Nianyuan. Chengyuan initially mad at her, calms down a bit but still asks her to leave so he can rest.

**Extra Thoughts:**

* We are firmly in the dating era, which means future problems will most likely be inheritance fights. I don't like the attitude Chengyuan has when speaking about Yusen. I hope he doesn't do anything to make me plan his murder rather than just hate him.
* These episodes made me so so happy.",2,1767542318.0,CDrama,1,1.0,False

\- About 18k+ was spent on this house

\- When building (it will probably be obvious from the house tour) I didn’t really focus on aesthetics as it’s a grinding house, so I put functionality as top priority. However the house IS decorated e.g. in the kitchen!

\- Speaking of the kitchen, it is kitted out very well with donuts, pizzas, frier, lemonade, water, coffee, milkshakes, pancakes, etc.

\- The house includes good extras as well, such as the money tree and a mannequin!

\- It also has a Recording Nook for content creators to record!

\- Rooms include: Kitchen (food and water), Bathroom (bathtubs and litter boxes), Bedroom (beds), and Playroom (pianos for the Bored task)

\- In total you can grind 8 pets SIMULTANEOUSLY! There’s over 8 beds, 8 bathtubs, etc. However if you’d be happy making the pets take turns you can fit many more pets in here!

Tiramisu Cheesecake Recipe

Ingredients

Base
220g digestives (or graham crackers)
100g unsalted butter
A neutral biscuit works best — it gives a nice crunch without overpowering the tiramisu flavour.
Savioiardi (Sponge Fingers)
200g sponge fingers
2 tbsp instant coffee
35ml vanilla essence
150ml boiling water
Optional: 50–55ml coffee liqueur (I personally don’t use alcohol).

Filling / Batter
500g mascarpone
80g granulated sugar
1 tbsp vanilla extract
300ml double cream

Topping
40g cocoa powder (to dust)


Instructions
Crush the biscuits into fine crumbs (a food processor helps).

Melt the butter and mix into the crumbs until it resembles wet sand.
Press firmly into an 8"" springform tin.
In a bowl, dissolve the coffee in the boiling water and add vanilla essence.

 Let it cool completely.

In a new bowl, beat mascarpone, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.

In a separate bowl, whip the double cream to soft peaks, then fold into the mascarpone mixture.
Spread half the filling over the biscuit base.

Dip each sponge finger briefly into the cooled coffee mixture and lay them across the filling to form a full layer.
Add the remaining mascarpone mixture on top and smooth it out.
Dust generously with cocoa powder.

Chill Time:

Best: 12 hours for perfect. 

Minimum: 8 hours if you’re impatient.

1q3tcul,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q3tcul/essential_accessories_for_breville_bambino_for/,Essential Accessories for Breville Bambino for making iced latte [$100],"I bought my daughter a Breville Bambino (her first machine) and a Fellow Opus Conical Burr Coffee Grinder for Christmas (she doesn't have them yet, they'll be waiting for her at college after break). She lives in a dorm apartment with a kitchen, so the setup is simple but she can have countertop appliances.

She normally buys an iced latte with whole milk every day, so I'm guessing that's what she'll be making (at least in the beginning). After reading about two dozen posts here about essential accessories, I'm more confused than ever about what else she needs.

The one thing most agree on is a scale that measures to a tenth of a gram, so that's on the list. But beyond that, I'm not sure which accessories are really suited to her drink and which are for more elaborate drinks or more advanced users (I don't drink coffee, so I don't even know if that makes sense!).

The Bambino comes with accessories that many say are not good enough and should be replaced with higher-quality accessories. But are they enough to get her started, and she can upgrade as she figures it out? I could just give her a gift card for later.

1q3tasm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1q3tasm/the_chair/,The Chair,"Setting: St. Somewhere Hospital Rehab wing. Late afternoon. The air smells faintly of overcooked vegetables and fabreeze. A television murmurs to itself in the corner. 

 

Big Jeff sits in his chair. Not just *a* chair. The chair. High back, firm arms. Angle just right so his spine doesn’t scream and his head doesn’t feel like it’s sliding sideways off the planet.

 

He has arranged his world around it. Water on the right. Snacks on the left. Hat hooked over the arm. Remote exactly where his hand expects it.

 

Peace. Or as much peace as he can make it.

 

A rehab aide enters, cheerful and well-meaning.

 

Aide: “Hi, Jeff! We’re just going to move you over to this one today.”

 

She gestures to a different chair. It’s lower, softer. Absolutely wrong. Big Jeff blinks.

 

Big Jeff: “No.”

 

The aide pauses, smile flickering.

 

Aide: “Oh, it’s just for a few hours.”

 

Big Jeff: “No.”

 

He’s not loud, not angry but final. The aide tries again, hands already reaching.

 

Aide: “We need to keep things consistent for—”

 

Big Jeff straightens as much as he can, eyes sharp now.

 

Big Jeff: “Consistency is *why* I’m sitting here.”

 

He taps the arm of the chair.

 

Big Jeff: “This chair keeps my head steady. This chair doesn’t spike my nausea. This chair means I can participate with the world instead of spending the afternoon trying not to puke.”

 

The aide withdraws her hands.

 

Aide: “I didn’t realize—”

 

Big Jeff: “That’s okay. Now you do.”

 

A beat. Big Jeff’s eyes turn unforgiving.

 

Big Jeff: “And nobody moves my chair.”

 

Silence stretches. The TV laughs at something that isn’t funny. A nurse appears in the doorway, sensing tension like a professional.

 

Nurse: “Everything okay?”

 

Big Jeff doesn’t hesitate.

 

Big Jeff: “No. People keep moving my chair.”

 

The nurse looks at the chair. Then at Jeff.

 

Nurse: “Is it medically necessary?”

 

Big Jeff: “Yes. And emotionally non-negotiable.”

 

The nurse exhales, nodding slowly.

 

Nurse: “Alright. Let’s fix this.”

 

Ten Minutes Later

 

Big Jeff is wheeled—not rushed—down the hall.

 

Past the group room. Past the noise. Past the TV that never shuts up.

 

They stop at a door. A single room, quiet. The nurse opens it.

 

Nurse: “We can set you up in here. Your chair can stay put.”

 

Big Jeff surveys the space. Window. Light.

No roommate snoring like a freight train. And most importantly, the type of chair he likes.

 

He nods once.

 

Big Jeff: “That’ll do.”

 

They place his chair exactly where he wants it. No one argues. No one touches it again.

 

After

 

Big Jeff settles in, sighs as his body agrees with the decision. He leans back. Comfortable.

Safe. Respected.

 

No one moves Big Jeff’s chair.

 

Lizzie steps into the rehab room a little later, tote bag on her shoulder, coffee in hand. She pauses in the doorway.

 

Big Jeff is still in his chair by the window. Light just right. Peaceful.

 

He looks up, already braced for commentary.

 

Lizzie just smiles. Not the polite smile. The *that’s my person* smile.

 

She walks over, sets the coffee down, and gives the room an approving once-over like it passed inspection.

 

Lizzie: “Well.”

 

Big Jeff lifts an eyebrow.

 

Big Jeff: “Don’t start.”

 

She doesn’t. She rests a hand on the back of the chair instead.

 

Lizzie: “You did it.”

 

He shrugs, a little bashful now.

 

Big Jeff: “I explained the problem.”

 

Lizzie: “You advocated for yourself.”

 

She squeezes his shoulder.

 

Lizzie: “And nobody got yelled at. Nobody got bulldozed. Nobody cried.”

 

She leans in, voice softer.

 

Lizzie: “That’s growth, Jeff.”

 

He snorts.

 

Big Jeff: “Careful. I’ll get a reputation.”

 

Lizzie laughs quietly, the tension easing out of the room.

 

Lizzie:“I’m proud of you.”

 

That lands. He looks out the window for a second, jaw working.

 

Big Jeff: …Yeah?”

 

Lizzie: “Yeah.”

 

She picks up her coffee, clinks it lightly against his water cup.

 

Lizzie: “You took care of yourself. That matters.”

 

Big Jeff settles back into the chair—*his* chair— a little taller than before.

 

No shouting. No fallout. Just respect earned the calm way. Lizzie stays a while. And the chair doesn’t move. Life is good.",1,1767541941.0,Epilepsy_Universe,1,1.0,False

For context we live together and are currently purchasing a really old shabby house that will need heaps of work. We have been together for almost 3 years and living together for over a year now. 

Now I work full time , but he, he works usually 6 but sometimes 7 days a week. 7:30am until 7pm. 

He’s a very skilled and busy builder who has lots of work at the moment and a deadline to meet before we get the keys to our new house and start the work there. 

For example this week was 7 days , although he promised to take today off, he said that he had to go back to site and close the windows which were left open overnight as the flooring wad drying. 

My main issue is that when he is home, he spends hours speaking to cousins, friends , his sister, parents. 

And barely speak to me, and when he does , it’s almost always about plans for the house. 

Yesterday he started off by saying “babe you know what I really want to do…..” 

I smiled and was expecting “ I want to watch a movie together “ or maybe “I want to have a shower together “ ( we haven’t done that before lol ) 

But no 

He says “ I really want to make the extension 4 meters so we can have a bigger living room”

 

I understand he is under a lot of pressure and has so much going on, as he will be the one doing our refurb too. 

But

Is it impossible to put his phone down for the evening ? 

Is it impossible to plan for us to go for a walk to the park and get a coffee ? 

I feel like his priorities are all over the place and I’m not one of them. 

I’ve communicated to him and his response is that he provides more money to our relationship and is under pressure, and that apparently me doing the cooking, cleaning and laundry ON TOP of working full time, doesn’t mean anything. 

TL;DR 

My bf would rather be on the phone to friends and family than have a conversation with me, or rather scroll on TikTok. He also thinks that because he earns more, he brings more to the relationship. ",1,1767541887.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

This happened more than 2 years ago, but sometimes I wonder if I was in the wrong or if I exaggerated with my reaction 
I had female friends since middle school, so we had been friends for 16 years btw they are sisters, one is working and one is not, me and the sister that is working we both had cars, but we always always go out using mine as it is bigger and better, I never ever said anything or complained or asked for help in fuel, despite the fact that I am also struggling (I help my family and was paying intuition for my younger brothers) and in case my car was like unavailable they prefer to cancel our coffee date or postpone it, I was living in tangier and my family and friends are in salé, we always travel to Marrakesh every summer using my car, and during the trip we always divide all expenses in half eventhough they are 2 and I am 1 but I considered them family, and I always paid for anything extra since I get paid more than my friend, this is all to just give you context, in 2023, that summer as usual, we were planning our trip, and my granpa who is basically a father to me and we are living with him since childhoood (my parents are divorced btw) asked me since I am going to marrakssh to give him a ride there with his wife (we have a house in amzmiz) and my sister will come from amezmiz to take him there, of course I said yes, and guess what ?? My friends told me no...I was shocked !!! I told them kifash la ?? Rah anwsslohom and that's it it's not like they gonna spend the trip with us, I will drop you in the apartment and give them a ride to amezmiz which is like 60 km from marrakesh ang come back in case my sister can't make it, they said no they won't be comfortable and he can take the train !!!!!!! My grandpa is diabetic and has so many health issues and they still suggested I let him take the train !!! I said hell no, you guys nuts ?? And then they came up with an even crazier idea, they told me well you can take him and then come back for us !!!!! Hhhhhh so I come from tangier to salé, take my granpa to amezmiz then come back allll the way to take them from salé to marrakesh!! I was...deeply shocked ! I said no and then they said well, if you are taking him we won't go, I think they thought I would surrender since I am always the bigger person, I said ok no worries, I immediately canceled our airbnb, and ended up having the best summer with my family and spoiled my siblings ! We stopped talking afterwards, then the earthquake hit amzmiz badly, I was at the time back to tangier, but half of my family was still there, when I knew even salé got affected, i called all my friends to check, and for them, I called the 3rd sister who is married to ask about them, then she asked me how is my granpa in amezmiz, so they knew. They knew he still there but couldn't ask at all !!! That was the last straw, I quitely removed them from my social accounts, later they blocked me as a counter attack...i mean please !!

I was commuting and as it was pretty cold, decided to get hazelnut coffee from one of those standardized coffee kiosks.

I order some coffee and wait to get my cup. Three others are there by the stall, including an elderly man who was smoking. All of a sudden I hear some violet coughing and saw the faces change on the people working at the kiosk. Turned just to look at the smoking guy wheeze and cough, and get this, spitting out. Now, I don't mind all this if he excused himself and went away from the stall like a normal human being. He was spitting and coughing violently for almost an entire minute right next to him and the kiosk, get this, WHILE LOOKING AT ME.

I was beyond disgusted and moved away to the other side away from his sight, quite casually to not be disrespectful of a sick man (assuming). I was basically hiding from him cuz I really did think he was staring at me. Me, a grown ass man with a full beard and a decent build. I think I should be letting you all know I'm wearing shorts, if that matters.

Now get this, HE GETS UP VIOLENTLY COUGHING AND SPITTING. LIMPED TO A DIFFERENT CHAIR WHERE HE COULD GET VIEW OF ME. I was shook I'm not going to lie, he looked very scary and I was NOT enjoying my coffee. I couldn't stomach things anymore and decided to bin the remaining. That's when I realised I need to get to my scooty which was parked close to the chair he was on.

I tried to play it cool and walked casually not making an eye contact at all. He gets up as I get closer, limps two steps toward me. I reach my scooty, still not looking at him. He turned away for a second reaching into his pocket while LOOKING AT ME WITH INTENT.

I am trying to find something to replace scrolling for when I have little energy. So far, what I can come up with is just staring at the ceiling, which is honestly fine. But I’m wondering what other people do? I read the activities list, but I already do a lot of the things on it, and the ones I don’t do sound overwhelming and exhausting to do first thing in the morning or when my brain and body are already fried. 

I already read, do yoga, strength train at the gym, walk my dogs, go skiing in winter and cycling or hiking in summer/fall, volunteer once per month at the food bank, go to church a few times per month, call my family once per week, garden, do housework/cleaning/chores/errands, and I picked up ASL to learn/practice to try to get me off of mindlessly scrolling. I also like playing video games. I’d like to spend more time exercising, but it feels like I’m pushing my body to the limit already. 

I am wondering what to do and what people do in moments where you just need down time. For instance, I woke up too early this morning and couldn’t go back to sleep. My body is very sore from working out all week and skiing yesterday so I don’t want to immediately exercise, I will be going to yoga or the gym later, but I just feel like being lazy and cozy. I don’t want to do my housework yet since I’m so go-go-go that I’d just like some rest in bed for a bit before I get up and tackle all the activities of the day. So that leaves other hobbies like ASL or reading, but that feels like it takes *so* much energy that I don’t have right now. I will later, but right now I’m just lazy, cozy, brain dead, and adding one more thing to *do* is the last thing I want to do.

What do people do in these moments? Is there something passive that takes the same amount of effort as scrolling or at least minimal brain power? Again, I guess I could stare at the ceiling and I think that would be good for me, but looking for other creative suggestions and wondering what people do to replace the morning ease into the day. I guess it’s like my version of reading the paper with your coffee before you get your day started….. maybe I should start getting physical newspapers? Idk, please help!

I’m trying to think of what I did pre phones and the computer, but i don’t think I ever had a before, really. My parents worked super hard but didnt take care of themselves, so they’d come home from work, nap, and watch television. I never had any hobbies in childhood as a result except reading, watching tv, and going online. I was born in 1991 and honestly grew up on the internet with unlimited access to everything. When I try to think of what I did in middle school and high school before school, I would watch cartoons or music videos. Anyway I need help! 

Also, I have severe ADHD, so I definitely think I am more vulnerable to the dopamine hit from scrolling. 

Maybe sudoku or crosswords or something in a physical paper book? I bought a prompted journal for moments like this, but I just sit there staring at it if I don’t have energy/brain power. But maybe that’s just a matter of training my brain and I should push through it?

""We’re going to make maple syrup great again—by making it American.""

The former president initially attempted to capture Carney by luring him into a giant maple leaf trap baited with poutine and promises of U.S. healthcare reform. When that failed, Trump resorted to his backup plan—a Trojan moose, complete with a plush interior and Wi-Fi.

Sources say Carney, who was surprisingly chill about the whole ordeal, tried to negotiate his release by offering Trump a lifetime supply of Tim Hortons coffee and Timbits. However, Trump held firm, demanding full control over Canada's syrup reserves instead.

""I’ve had the best negotiations, believe me,"" Trump insisted. ""I captured the Prime Minister fair and square. Now, I’m just waiting for Trudeau to call and make a deal. Maybe he can throw in a moose or two.""

The former president wasted no time announcing plans to rebrand the syrup as ""Trumple Syrup."" A new marketing campaign is already underway, featuring slogans like ""Taste the Freedom!"" and ""Pour on the Patriotism!""

Critics have pointed out that Trump's plan to replace traditional maple syrup with a blend of high-fructose corn syrup and a ""secret ingredient"" from Mar-a-Lago's kitchen may not sit well with purists. But Trump remains unfazed, claiming he’ll “win over the hearts and pancakes of the people"".

The capture has sparked international outrage, with Justin Trudeau reportedly browsing ""How to Rescind Citizenship"" forums and Vladimir Putin offering to trade ten bears for Carney.

Canadian citizens, meanwhile, have taken to social media with the hashtag #FreeCarney and memes featuring Mounties preparing rescue moose brigades.

As for Carney, he’s reportedly enjoying the Florida weather and has already made friends with the resort’s alligator population, who have offered their services should negotiations stall.

While the world watches this sticky situation unfold, one thing is certain: Trump has once again managed to keep himself—and his quest for the world's finest breakfast condiment—on everyone's lips.",9,1767541486.0,PoliticalHumor,0,0.91,False

‘Good evening.’

‘Goo-od evenering,’ he tried, rolling excitedly on his posterior quadrant.

‘Good eve-ning,’ Sean enunciated.

‘You are so calm!’

At this I pulled the bottle away from my face and shimmied over to see what Khan was trying to get at. Repeated use of that phrase would, in due time, earn him a crack in the face. He had his finger stuck tight on the sentence.

‘Kind! You are so kind!’ I yelled.

‘Calm!’ he corrected me.

‘No, kind!’ I said. ‘Kind!’ He looked confused but appeared to be homing in on the error.

We bade Khan goodnight.

Sean threw back his compartment door and there, seated comfortably with his writing binder splayed between his knees, sat our father. His pipe was clenched in his guilty lips and the smoke was thick enough to hammer a nail into it. The instigator of the smoking legislation had tarnished the non-smoking quarters.

‘Political Science 101 and Murphy’s Law, Dad. Ye who make the law will break the law.’

Dad puffed away with no rebuttal; he’d been caught, and a profound silence was his defence.

Returning to my room I fumbled for the light switch, intent on reading, but found myself groping and re-groping empty walls. I lay back on the sheets. The blackness was occasionally lit with strobes from outside activity. Shadows flit with passing lights. The distant clanging of road and rail crossings rose in pitch, then fell away. The train’s fluid motion clicked over the ties like chattering teeth. Moscow was falling away, kilometre by kilometre, shrinking. We were out in the hinterland of nowhere, encountering villages that one can only find in an extensive Russian atlas. I smiled to myself and faded away to slip some surly bonds.

 

I awoke and stayed perfectly still, as it took a moment to place myself. Once I’d confirmed I was a ‘passenger on a train,’ I sighed and drew back the cotton curtains. Light shot through my pupils and burned away memories, passwords, and the week I spent losing my virginity. Tearing, I stood back. Sunshine, with a brilliance you find in replacing a light bulb when the power’s on, ran over some unthreatening clouds. A forest edged the tracks, whipping by without interruption. Consulting my kilometre-by-kilometre guide of indispensable information, I placed our whereabouts somewhere east of the Volga River. The mighty ‘Mother Volga’ had passed in the darkness.

I was keen to find something ‘politically sensitive’ that was officially forbidden to photograph, an aerodrome or military installation, maybe a rusty missile silo. The Soviets had confiscated film, took away photos, and seemed quite suppressive of their edge on technology. I’d think a picture of a muddy family in a muddy town of muddy streets and no running water would speak more to the world than Moscow’s arrivals terminal. I didn’t want to take a picture, I just wanted to know that I could. The guide book listed the rail stations along with the expected length of the stop. The timetable of the entire journey was notched with many five, ten, and fifteen minute pauses, during which passengers could accost the kiosks, survey the perimeter, or stretch their limbs. The borders, it warned, had seen waits of six to ten hours. I put it away and turned to gaze at an endless forest of birch.

 

The Trans-Siberian travels on ‘Moscow Time,’ Greenwich Mean plus three hours, in its own little ego-orbit. It’s a surreal effect to witness. For example, the night had passed with the introduction of a new time zone. Moscow + 1. Since there were no watches among us to reset, this sudden transition hadn’t affected us one bit. It was a simple relief from time and timetables for us to know that our days were to include sunrise and sunset and that day and night were independent of our own conceived clocks. I feared this might excite my circadian rhythm and toss me into a perpetual cycle of restless catnaps and produce the narcoleptic symptoms that often ruin dinner and Sunday drives, but I decided to remain optimistic and awake for the next twelve hours, regardless. Dad slid back the door without knocking and handed me a steaming plastic cup of instant coffee.

‘Hey kid! Do you know where we are?’

‘Morning, Dad. I put us somewhere between Svetcha and Kotelnich. I’m just waiting till we cross the Vyatka to confirm … ‘

‘We’re on the Trans-Siberian!’ he stated gleefully. ‘Whatcha upto?’

‘Counting trees.’

‘Yeah, it’s been like this since dawn.’ He leaned into the door frame. ‘Hey, looks like this train thing’s gonna be a good place to get some writing done. I’ve been hitting the pages all morning, better part of the last three hours.’

Lately Dad had been deeply involved with a novel he was writing. The train was his ‘time’ to delve into it with fervour.

‘Your brother and I are next door. It might be nice if you made an appearance in our den of opposing philosophies. How did your room get to looking like you have more people in it than we do?’

‘I do not know,’ I said truthfully.

‘Anyway kid, enjoy the coffee,’ he said. He left the door ajar.

I sipped the hot water and propped my journal between my knees to the pages, sketchings and distant memories of Germany’s Autobahn. I could see into the past, all of it. It felt like I’d been gone a year. I strapped on my hip pack, smelt both armpits to confirm I had at least another day left in this particular T-shirt, and left the compartment. The woods sped by as I nodded into Dad and Sean’s room. ‘Thanks for the coffee.’ I conceded. ‘I’d like to request that from now on, my instant coffees get stirred. I just hit a wall of crystals, and I’m far too awake to lounge in my quarters – despite the large size. I’m taking my journal for a walk to find the restaurant car. Anyone interested?’

Sean just stared at me with tinny eruptions squirting from his headphones. He mouthed something profane indicating that he and Dad were in an adjustment period, one that I should have been witness to, if only to take a side. I ignored him. Dad, whom I’d caught mid-thought, took notice of me but was unwilling to let go of the grasp he had on his particular cerebral gift of prose. He raised an index finger but it slowly moved back to his paperwork.

The corridor led to the vestibule door at the end, beside Khan’s closed room, from which muffling static emanated from his transistor radio. I cracked the big handle to open the heavy door between the wagons and crossed the rubber-encased path, the dancing steel plates rubbed and slid across each other, suffering every bump and turn. Through the next door, which put me in a coach filled with a great number of families, screaming children, and people who stood at the windows watching the numbing forest. All of the following four cars were full of people pressing into the windows or stepping a yard back into their cabins to allow my passage. Another door opened and spilled me into the restaurant car, the middle wagon of the train.

Three Englishmen at one table were arguing about the European Union. They took a quick, rolling-eyeball look at me and then carried on discussing. I ventured beyond the fulcrum into the remaining half of the train. The transition into the rear wagons was startling. The trains were essentially Russian-made human transports with no barriers to keep out the sounds of the squealing and clicking wheels. The sickly bluish-green walls were chipped with age, and the thin carpet had holes the size of footprints. These cars were much colder than our coach, and drafts ran in every direction. I remembered taking notice of a plaque near Khan’s room stating that our car had been produced in West Germany. This one was a warehouse for people. I was thankful we’d not gone ‘as affordable as possible.’ People stood lazily at the smudgy windows. Children’s screams shot from behind partially pulled drapes. Quick glances into some of the rooms revealed people stacked like baggage, sandwiched between cubed plastic boxes.

Mongolian and Chinese passengers lay strewn among the Russians, perhaps isolated by language, for days on end. I passed through to the next car and found more of the same. Luggage spilled out into the common area through which everyone had to pass. Laughter erupted from a cabin where a group of men were playing cards. Yells, cries, and foreign argumentative rhetoric rose above the whining of the wheels. I crossed into another wagon. Then another. And yet another. Finally the tracks could be seen receding from the last window of the last car. Here, three men were arguing loudly in Russian, breaking into a laugh every now and then. I lit up a cigarette and enjoyed the new view beyond the glass. I heard an unintelligible remark uttered a few times then was tapped on the shoulder. I swivelled quickly and covered my hip pack with my forearm.

‘Americanski?’ asked a tall, thin Russian with bad skin.

‘Uh … nyet, ya Canadyets,’ I answered.

‘Ah! Vwee goveryety pa-ruski!’ he exclaimed, pleased that I spoke Russian. I began locating my infantile grasp of the language.

‘Tolka choot-choot,’ I replied. ‘Only a bit.’ I lost control of the next question and answered ‘Tolka choot-choot’ again. They stared. The key phrase I’d mastered was ‘Esli vree goverytye miedlina, ya paneemyoo,’ meaning ‘I’ll understand if you speak slowly,’ which I threw out to slow them down so I could understand.

‘Sergei,’ the pimpled one introduced himself.

‘Brent.’

‘Brant? Eta Pavel,’ he said about the heavy-set man, loaded with weight-bearing Asian features, standing on his right.

‘Ee Vladimir.’ Sergei pointed to a man of average everything – height, weight, build, and handshake. Vladimir rifled off some Russian to the others in a blaze of untraceable grammar. His eyes were kind but darted around, calculating something.

Their simple cigarettes burned loosely, churning lumps of carcinogenic exhaust into the small compartment. The three of them were going to Vladivostok, then beyond to Khabarovsk, on the volcanic rim of the Pacific. Vladimir, the first Kazakh I’d ever met, was an airline mechanic. His broad nose swept back across his wide cheeks and his ink-black hair hung over his forehead. Pavel and Sergei claimed to be something, then burst out laughing. ‘Unemployable’, I said trying to fit in.

As if this short discussion had been a long-time acquaintance, they insisted I return to their couchette for a drink. I refused vehemently as warning signs flagged through my mind. But they wouldn’t hear of me turning down an invitation. I thought that perhaps they’d never had the opportunity to rob a Canadian and this could be a novelty for them. My apprehensive smirk did not elicit any sympathy. I resisted further. Under the circumstances it was futile, unwelcome, and above all else, un-Russian. I sensed it. Nine wagons away, Dad was happy that we were safe and abiding by the ‘law of threes.’

We shuffled back to their room. I sat on a bed and found myself sandwiched between Sergei and Vladimir. Pavel returned with a large, quiet friend and a lawn chair, which he placed to bar the doorway. He slid the door shut with a solid thunk. Beers were pulled from a tired knapsack and passed on to each of us.

‘Nostrovia!’ we toasted, using the Russian cliché to our health. Sergei plucked a well-worn deck of playing cards and flipped piles of cards in front of each of us. Dog-eared and torn, the cards led me to conclude that in time familiarity would reveal a complete knowledge of the deck, to anyone, simply by their backs. I chugged beer with the intent of playing their game and picked up my hand. If it was hearts, I was good. If it was blackjack, I’d lost. If it was poker, I was stable and would take two for another pair. It was none of them. Sergei would peer over when my turn came around, scan my hand and pluck the appropriate card. Someone must have won, for eventually the cards were rounded up, shuffled, and set aside.

Pavel flipped back the knapsack flap and pulled out a long bottle by its neck. Stale rye bread, cheese, and a cucumber were diced into hors d’oeuvres as the bottle bowed before into three shot glasses. Perhaps it was my status as a ‘foreigner’ that made them wait and watch my peer-pressured arm lift the glass to my lips. I emptied it and they cheered during my mild shaking from impurities in the distillate. I tipped back against the wall. Another ounce was put down and, some of food offered. Here I was at some early hour, appallingly buzzed, and trespassing the third rule: ‘Never, ever … drink with strangers.’ The alcohol enabled a ghostly figure of my father to appear rippling in the corner and shaking three fingers. There I sat, my hip pack loaded with every piece of identification I owned, all my traveller’s cheques, my passport, and enough cash to be bloodied senseless for. All I could do was sit with a smile on my face and watch Sergei pull the cards from my atrophied hand. Visions of being thrown overboard surfaced: me, scrambling to the tracks in my boxers and socks to watch the back end of the train fade into the distance.

As I thought of beating my way out into the hall, everyone suddenly stood up. Sergei slid the door open and announced that it was time for a cigarette. We ambled back to the end compartment. I listened while they spoke casually and watched the smoke fog up the windows. Sergei invited me back for another round of cards, more vodka, and petrifying fear, but I declined and said they could find me in the restaurant car if the need arose. Good byes, do svydanias, I never thought I’d hear were said, and I was left alone. In the thick air. I smiled. I’d survived all three taboos.

I fled back to my quarters, still euphoric, and entered the wrong one. The occupants were preoccupied, so I moved to mine undetected.

Dad came around the corner. ‘Are you drunk?’

‘I will never ever play Russian Roulette again … ever,’ I turned my face into my pillow, ‘NEVER!’

‘Brent, son,’ Dad said calmly, ‘Did you drink with strangers?’

‘Well, that’s all there is on this train. Strangers.’

‘You –’

‘It was voluntary. I didn’t have a choice in the matter, but it was voluntary.’

‘That’s an admission of guilt. It would mean you trusted them. Then drank with them. You broke two of the three DON’TS in an hour!’

‘And I had my hip pack on.’

Dad struggled for a thespian histrionic breath and was about to pour that over his vocal cords.

‘Just kidding,’ I said. ‘I was drawing a father’s day card in the restaurant car. It’s not done yet’.

Dad retreated to his trenches but never mentioned what he didn’t know again.

 

I was the only patron in the restaurant car. Looking through the dusty film on the window, my right eye fixed itself on a large bottle of beer sitting helplessly in a sinister heat bath. A card table laden of chocolate bars, potato crisps, juices, beer, vodka, and menus displayed the train’s sundries. My left eye began to wander about the car in search of something interesting but faulted back to the bottle. I moved across the vinyl bench and rose to grab it. I then cornered to face the kitchen, to pay.

The Russian cook was quick-tongued, ‘Southpaw sits atop bunny droppings … Bunny droppings!’ That is what I made of it, and it could not be broken down for my Berlitz guide.

I withdrew and opened the bottle enroute to base camp, which now sat in the sun, indicating we’d altered course ever so slightly. The ensuing displeasure of dehydrating in my cabin was soon masked by a bottle of ‘Black Bull 12%.’

I opened my journal and found an entry Sean had written in black felt pen on the title page. ‘This book has been modified to fit your intellect.’ Creasing on a new set of pages, I began to attempt to catch the many moments that had passed since I last saw my family. Pen-to-paper. Laptops were still black screens with orange font and weighed as much as a desktop, so I’d left mine at home. Pen-to-paper would always be in style; I knew I’d never bring a computer on a train.

The gentle tossing of the train car, the untraceable identity of the birch, the stillness of everything except the cyclonic dust hit by the sun, encouraged a cozy feeling that everything would, forever and a day, be all right. My heart was not yet trumpeting brass, only an uncomplicated cello solo. But hordes of dancing, prancing visions were hit point blank by the cupid of the room-temperature Black Bull.

My headphones found their way to my ears. Bruce Dickinson growled ‘My grandfather taught me how to fight/ Old fashion stuff like wrong and right.’ I thought of my grandfather. He had died the month before we left for Russia. He and I were very close and remarkably similar. His values, morals, and genteel sophistication were qualities that seemed to me to be declining with the death of each carrier. A man who would help his enemy. Who wouldn’t go to a doctor unless he had nine arrows in his back. Maybe it was only that I’d finally had the chance to slow, to reflect on the memories that needed tending to; not the frantic, lightning warfare that my synapses had been up to in the previous months of preparation and research for this journey. I gave a small salute, toasted his ghost and felt him gently squeeze my knee.

A young woman entered the dining car, followed by a man roughly her age. She was dressed in a tight bright dinner dress and high heels, not really suited to a long railway journey unless you were renting your body. They seated themselves across from my booth, and I reorganized my position clumsily so as to better get a view of her. They spoke Russian in low voices, rather chit-chat, indicating some professional courting. The woman drew a long, cigarette from a pouch and her companion slid his cuff-linked arm across the table, sparking a lighter that produced no flame. Then there she was, not two feet from me, this white Russian witch, with her painted lips wrapped around her thin cigarette, making the international motions for a match. I froze like I’d stumbled upon a fawn in a clearing, careful not to frighten her away. I slowly slid my lighter from my pocket.

Within moments we’d established our nationalities, marital status, and reasons for being on the train. Her name was Tsveta Krasavistya. She spoke English with a unique accented worldly pride. Misha, the gentleman whom she confessed to having met only an hour before, saluted and moved to my booth. Tsveta slid next to him.

Misha knew three words in English; unfortunately they weren’t ones I recognized. Tsveta translated the exchange, considerably lengthening our discussion. Misha had the angry expression of someone who had done and seen a lot more than he wished he had. His dark hair was shaved close to his head and, at twenty-two years old, his Russian features were well accented by experience. Tsveta interpreted his history for me, pausing frequently to challenge him with questions of her own. At times, she was visibly shocked, though I was not privy to their little eddies of conversation. Misha, we learned, had just defected from the Mafia in Moscow after engaging in six years of ruthless criminal activities that had sculpted his face, given him physical and mental scars, and affected the privileged way he carried himself. He was returning to Krasnoyarsk, to his family, whom he’d not seen since running away from them and their Siberian lives. He’d been propelled by the dreams and hopes of a young man for the big city. In Misha’s case, that city was Moscow. Six years of extortion, violence, murder, drugs, and the resulting lifestyle had exposed him to a chunk of big-city reality, given him a dose of remorse and clarity, and made him decide to go home. His mother was a high-ranking officer in the Russian army – an establishment as corrupt and dangerous as the Mafia, so they had a lot in common.

‘Did I just say that out loud?’ I asked.

Tsveta nodded slowly. They were silent. I took a swig of beer and pondered why some seconds are so long when other are so short. One should be able to control that. Misha got up to get some potato chips.

‘What about you, Tsveta?’ I said, leaning my elbows on the tabletop.

She smiled, a little embarrassed, and toyed with her hair. Her name in Russian meant ‘Colour.’ From her innocent reflections and calm demeanour, I gauged that she was an impressionable, untarnished child living in a well-developed woman’s body. She held her innocence well. Tsveta was a stripper. She preferred the term ‘dancer.’ I said ‘tomato-tomato’. She had plied her trade in Irkutsk, the city she called her hometown. However, a developing interest in kitchen cabinet remodelling had lured her to Finland, where she’d been working for two years. But that ended in some way she didn’t want to talk about. I asked her where she was heading now. The train was taking her and her nine-year-old brother back to Irkutsk. Her soft-brown, shoulder-length hair, marbled with dewy highlights, rounded her parabolic face. The eyes of the little girl held the warmth of a nativity scene.

‘Vat aboutch you, Brrrant?’ She rolled the second letter of my name around her throat.

‘I worked in the cablevision industry but I wasn’t a news anchor or the guy who makes weather maps or a producer on Friends. I deliver TV to TV-addicted families. But I’d really like to write. I think I hear my heart saying that. Or my soul… whichever one isn’t saying “Get us down from this fucking telephone pole!” Yeah, I like to write. My whole family does.’

‘Have you been published?’ she said, a lock of hair falling over her right eye.

‘Not even photocopied. But writers don’t judge themselves by getting published. Only other people do.’ I took a few swigs of beer while trying to remain convinced of this. ‘Sean’s got a short story done. My Dad has some books published. I’m next. I’ve written some really good classified ads that have seen print. And I can do a red-carpet obituary. So if you ever die, look me up.’

She asked to be excused and left to change.

Misha had since returned with a Black Bull smile and a bottle for each of us. He and I watched Tsveta leave, then composed ourselves uncomfortably to face one another. The language barrier was like a muddy trench. I would ask a question and get an answer ten times longer and more incoherent than the one I was prepared for. Misha sensed this and pulled a deck of cards from his vest. He began shuffling.

Tsveta returned, sumptuously decorated in a tight-fitting dress that pressed her breasts together like gears. I noticed that Misha noticed and felt resentful that he hadn’t taken ill and left us to lie down. Instead, he dealt out card hands and proceeded to initiate the game that Sergei had attempted to teach me earlier.

‘I lost my virginity in a card game,’ I offered.

‘Do you do magic tricks?’ she asked.

‘No. But once I disappeared for three days.’

‘This is new game to you, it is called Russian Stupid.’ Tsveta smiled without self-injury. I smiled at Misha’s silence.

The rules seemed to change every time I came close to understanding them. I began pilfering the occasional face card in a game I called ‘Canadian Not So Stupid.’ Soon there was roughly half a deck left. Misha spoke to Tsveta with his head cocked coercively. She turned to me, ‘Would you like to see Misha’s gun?’

It crossed my mind that he wasn’t playing with a full deck. In every sense of the term.

‘I don’t know if that would be wise,’ I said, but Misha was already bouncing it uncomfortably off my knee below the table. I guessed he was prone to pointing weaponry directly at people. Reaching under the table, I rotated the gun away from my vital organs and weighted it in my palm.

‘357?’ I queried with a look I hoped conveyed that I was informed. It wasn’t a shotgun, so this was the available term I knew.

‘Da,’ he replied with a gloating pride. I sewed my eyebrows together and looked it over. I was uneasy with it; I believe the safety latch was developed after my antics in a previous life in Wyoming. I nodded approval and passed it back – barrel toward Misha – beneath the table.

'You have Russian Roulette in Canada?' she asked.

'Uh, we draw straws.'

'In Russia we say: Punch me. I think I'm dreaming.'

'It's ‘pinch’... forget it. I don't want to mess with natural selection.'

As another round of warm beers grazed the table, compliments of Misha, my brother walked in and immediately dropped himself beside Tsveta, thereby decreasing the odds Misha and I had silently acknowledged we had between us. Sean was inspired to answer the battery of questions Tsveta launched. Her dream was to go to America, the ‘U-YES of A,’ she said, as if she had pompoms. Canadians, by default, attempt to dissuade anyone who harbours feelings that America is ‘it’ and offer our serenity, apologies, and kindness, all genuinely Canadian. And so I tried to do.

My short rant was not well received. Though the popularity of Canada is largely due to our national modus operandi, we fall short of the Hollywoods, Disneylands, and the superlatives of everything you can lust, kill, or die for. I said this apologetically, even saying ‘We’re trying, though. We do have a gun culture now.’ I explained that was not to sell short our involvement as a nation, but being as close to American as is possible, we maintained a distinct status – and with only a tenth of their population! And we had a political leader who probably, if ever, slept only with his wife. And then I ran out of ideas. I retreated to my corner and tended to my Black Bull.

Sean entered the conversation, armed. ‘Americans and Canadians are the same but different. I mean, we live off the same buffet of television and music. We share most of the same fast foods, the same franchise outlets and gas stations. Illegally, we even fish the same waters. But you can spot the subtle differences. It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to notice that some neurons don’t fire in the Americans. And thank God some of ours don’t spark like theirs. They have ten times the population, ergo, ten times most everything else. Except hand-carved bears made out of tree stumps, maple syrup, the lucrative part of the North Pole, and open space. We control most of that. If they come for those… I will fight. It’d be a miltary environmental war.’

I bumped knuckles with Sean without really understanding him. But I was on his side – even though Russia had much of the North Pole, lumber that sped by as we spoke, and the idea of ‘wide open spaces’ wasn’t something you had to sell people who live in Siberia.

‘Did you just say “ergo”?’ I winced at him.

The sun was falling and, once at the critical last attempt at light, it thrust a myriad of sharp yellow daggers at the sky. Then it was gone. Tsveta got up and left to change again. I caught Sean trying to wink, a social custom he’s always done simultaneously with both eyes. Then he and Misha got up to obtain a bottle of vodka. Soon my intolerance for drink would shine through.

The first few shots sank into me like a battleship had attacked. I started listing to starboard. I recall the dinner crowd arriving and leaving. As evening moved in, I watched darkness lurk beyond the light thrown into the woods by the restaurant car. I drew a second wind. I remember referring to myself as an objet d’art, trying to teach line-dancing to the kitchen staff, and whispering ‘I’m not yelling.’

And I remember telling Tsveta… no, please, tell me I did not say that.

 

The dark hours of early morning were filled with a bitter restlessness. I slept fitfully. Though eerily quiet, with nothing but blackness filling the window, substantial events were taking place ‘out there.’ Out beyond the tracks. We had traversed the Ural Mountains, the spine of Russia, as we slept. Another time zone swept over the train. More importantly, the white-stone obelisk that breaks apart the continents of Europe and Asia was out there. We were winding down from the mountains into a dark plain of emptiness. Finally, I was jarred fully awake with the deceleration into Ekaterinburg, a place I’d hoped to visit and, were it not for the timetable getting us in at about three in the a.m., I might have.

Historically, Ekaterinburg, or Sverdlovsk, has been a powerful migraine for Russia. Tsar Nicholas and his family had been exiled here; and here they were murdered. Their bullet-riddled and bayoneted bodies were dismembered with axes, bathed in acid, and deposited in a mine shaft. It was long believed that Nicholas’s youngest daughter, Anastasia, survived the slaughter. In 1920, a woman by the name of Anna Anderson was admitted to a Berlin hospital claiming to be Anastasia. Anna died in 1984 amid widespread skepticism of her claim, and in 1991 DNA tests on the remains of the family assured the world Anastasia had died alongside her family on that fateful July evening in 1918. Ekaterinburg also houses the remains of the American U2 spy plane shot down from sixty thousand feet by the Soviets in 1960. The pilot, Gary Powers, parachuted safely into the arms of the Russians, who used the incident as leverage in the Cold War. The city is also the birthplace of Boris Yeltsin.

But my recognition and memory of these significant events was all that I experienced of Ekaterinburg. We passed through; the Urals were done with, and we were on the Siberian Plain. The first sign of dawn. But it wasn’t the sun. The forest, still thick with its zebra pattern of birch and verdant needles, broke away to encompass grassy fields of golden taiga. A deep brown of surface soil nipped at the rail bed of gravel as would the shallow surf of a lakeside. It came crashing down into the silence. Suddenly the train braked, whining with the deep moans of stressing metal. The decrease in speed, an urgent and staggered affair, pitched me from the bunk and shoved me to the floor. Perhaps a cow was staring down the engineer or we had met the frantic cliché of the track-straddling motorist who can’t start his vehicle. Halting abruptly, grinding down, the resultant noises pierced the chord range of a violin coming unstrung.

We pulled the window down, and there, directly ahead of the engine, which was bowed into our view by the curve of track, raged an uncontrolled forest fire. Flames of tinder-fed amber leapt into the sky. Stretching over acreage of scrub forest fuel, now charcoaled black and bleeding with trails of smoke, the fire fanned itself up to and then over the tracks, a cavern of searing flame.

I left our compartment and headed through the crowded halls of several wagons, Sean at my heels with every step. As we neared the engine, the fire became a mesmerizing force of colour and hunger, its arms flickering out to engulf fresh trees. The opaque door to the second car back from the engine was thrown open to two men armed with machine guns. They were standing among boxes, wooden crates, and large cloth bags of mail. One was on the phone speaking, I deduced, to the engineer. The other shoved us back into the vestibule and slammed the door shut. It occurred to me that the only guys with machine guns on the train didn’t have windows.

The flames were now high on both sides, creeping up on us. Curiously, the amount of smoke was minimal, blown low through the forest. We reasoned that that was why the train had come so close. The fire wouldn’t have been seen above the treetops until it was too late. Or, if the smoke had been seen by the driver, he may have thought it unlikely that the tracks would be endangered. There was no public address system on the train, hence no announcement; it was all guesswork. The attendants could not have known any more than the passengers did, except the frequency of wildfires and the usual manner in which they were dealt with.

The train made a lurching effort and the engines jumped to speed. The fire was now on both sides of the track, heat pressed through the windows. Sean and I ran through the carriage corridors, trying to stay in the middle until we were hindered by the doors and commotion of the passengers. The fire raged alongside us for possibly the length of the entire train. Burnt air curled through the carriages and people choked and covered their faces. Once the fire fell away, it was still a commotion; everyone was awake, and the smell of that frightful memory stuck with me through the rest of the night.

1q3t1jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q3t1jn/aio_my_husband_has_relocated_to_another_country/,AIO My husband has relocated to another country and it’s only been i2 weeks and he goes a day without answering me.,"I’m F (50) and my husband M (47) we’ve been married for 17 years but together for 20.  My husband is from another country in South America. I am also from the same region, but we’re not from the same country. When I met my husband, it was a casual thing. I had just gotten out of a long-term committed relationship and I had moved to a new area in Washington state and I didn’t know anyone and my husband struck me as a good conversationalist and he was attractive to me and we got into a relationship very quickly. I decided that I wanted to have a child and I told him and he agreed that he we would have a child together, but I told him that there would be no strings. I didn’t care if I was a single mother. I have a good career and I have enough family money to support a child. We stayed together because got along well. 

A few years later, we got married, we had another child. His biological daughter from a previous relationship came to live with us. My mom came to live with us. My mom got sick and we moved back to Miami and we’ve been living here for the past six or seven years. The reason I add all of this is because this is a long established committed relationship and we’re older so we don’t rely primary primarily on online communication and my husband really doesn’t even have an online presence. He’s not particularly tech savvy. He’s a botanist and tree surgeon.  

Recently with immigration issues and everything my husband has found his business unsustainable. He had a landscaping business here in Miami that was flourishing and doing well, but as of now it’s pretty impossible to find people to work for landscaping that have documentation and the price that you have to pay documented people to do landscaping in Miami is astronomical and then you have to teach them on the job. So those services become expensive and no one wants to pay. So we came to the decision that it will be better for him to return to his home country Even though he has residence papers because I am a US citizen and we have three children. He will go back to his home country and establish himself there and then we would meet him later. Our oldest daughter who is 18 years old is leaving on 9 January. 

My daughter who is 18 years old is very responsible. She has a boyfriend who is also 18 years old and he is very responsible. He has car insurance and a license and recently his car broke down and is irreparable. So on the weekends, I lend them my car to help me, because they get groceries for me and they do little errands for me and yesterday they wash the car and also for them to go out. My husband has never really been on board with their relationship because of reasons. He did not like that I lent them my car. So yesterday when I went out to my car to get milk because it was no milk for my coffee I saw that there was a scuff and marks, and someone had hit the car. I went into the house and I said that the car had been crashed for want of a better word and if they knew what had happened? They did not know and had not noticed and very honestly, driving here in Miami is a shit show and it could’ve happened at my job. Miami is a very dangerous place to drive. There are a lot of unsafe drivers and parking is Russian roulette. I hadn’t had coffee and my daughter was very upset and we both called my husband. She did first and told him the situation and he heard her but sort of sort of cut her off. A little later when I called he did not answer me. 

The day went on and the scuff came out and you can’t even see that anything had happened to the car. It’s not a new car. It’s a Mazda from 2016 that I am keeping because since we’re planning on moving what is the point in buying or leasing a new car? I called my husband several times throughout the day for moral support and guidance and he did not answer me. I think he’s upset that I lent them the car and something happened or I don’t really know what happened. He could have had problems and was unable to answer the phone, but he never updated me. 

This morning I sent him a message because I’m really actually quite upset and hurt that he couldn’t send me a sentence throughout the whole day. We are actually or at least I am very much in love and being separated like this has really crushed my heart but it’s necessary because of the situation in the United States right now. He has a long road ahead of him in his native country because he hasn’t been there in 30 years. I understand.  But I don’t understand not being able to send a single sentence saying, “hello I’m OK, but I’m really busy today because of ex reasons. I’ll call you later.” it really made me angry and feeling unloved. He also has a history of being avoidant and kind of passive aggressive. So not knowing what is happening and why he’s not answering me. My first thought is that he’s giving me the silent treatment because of what happened with the car. I’m actually really mad about it because in a long distance relationship, we don’t really have room for this kind of borderline emotionally abusive tactic. When you’re not physically there with the other person, I feel that it’s even more incumbent to express yourself, verbally and to show caring and support. 

Am I overreacting? It’s been 24 hours of silence.

1q3szf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1q3szf1/a_decade_for_nothing/,A decade for nothing,"My mom's cancer had come back. And I needed 40,000 dollars to save her.

 It took every ounce of courage I had to go to Miguel Peaden—my secret multimillionaire boyfriend for ten years—and ask him for help.

 But he just tapped his fingers arrogantly on his desk.

 ""You think my money grows on trees? Just because you ask, I'm supposed to hand you 40,000 like it's nothing?

 ""That's enough. You can go now—I have another meeting coming up.""

 Then he motioned for his secretary to escort me out of his office.

 I looked at the man sitting in that luxurious office and gave a bitter smile before calling the only person willing to give me 40,000 dollars.

 ""You once said that if I married you, you'd give me 40,000 dollars as a wedding gift. Does that still stand?""

 \*\*\*

 His voice was low and steady. ""Kylie, forget 40,000—I'd give you my life. I've waited ten years for you.""

 ""Alright. In seven days, once my mom is out of the ICU, I'll marry you.""

 After hanging up, I walked over to Miguel's secretary, Leticia Burton's desk, and scribbled a few words on a sticky note.

 ""Miguel, we're over.""

 I dropped the pen and strode out of the office.

 Leticia was Miguel's secretary.

 For most of my ten-year relationship with Miguel, Leticia was always there—hovering in the background.

 Whenever I messaged Miguel on WhatsApp, trying to be sweet, it was Leticia who replied.

 ""Sorry, Ms. Haston, Mr. Peaden is in a meeting. I'll pass your message along.""

 She handled everything—buying condoms, groceries, clothes, even Miguel's everyday wardrobe.

 It was all Leticia.

 I hated it.

 I argued with Miguel over it countless times.

 But he'd just look at me calmly. ""Kylie, you have no taste, no eye for quality. Leticia is far more capable—why complain when she can handle it better?""

 His words used to shut me up every time.

 But now, I'd resigned myself to reality.

 After all, how could a regular college grad like me compete with Leticia, who had a master's degree from a top school?

 She was sophisticated—she could negotiate with clients and keep Miguel's life perfectly organized.

 Meanwhile, I'd worked at Miguel's company for ten years and I was still just an overlooked employee in operations.

 If Miguel admired Leticia so much, maybe he should be with her.

 After all, when I asked him for a 40,000-dollar loan, he still had me go through company procedures—at Leticia's suggestion.

 I never expected that the moment I stepped out of the building, I'd get a call.

 My mom was gone.

Chapter 2

 She died five minutes ago.

 A wail burst out from my lips before I could stop it.

 Then, as if on cue, Leticia called me again.

 ""Ms. Haston, Mr. Peaden is leaving on a business trip tomorrow. Please have two pairs of dress shoes and three suits ready for him.""

 Hearing Leticia's commanding tone, I snapped at her in anguish, ""Didn't you see the sticky note? Miguel and I broke up.""

 ""Sorry, Ms. Haston. I haven't given the note to Mr. Peaden yet, and Mr. Peaden hasn't informed me that you've broken up. So please follow Mr. Peaden's process and prepare his clothes.""

 Pain pressed in on my chest, sharp and relentless.

 If the cab hadn't arrived just then, I might have turned around and slapped Leticia across the face.

 After all, if it weren't for her, my mom wouldn't have died.

 Mom had been battling cancer for years. She'd already left the hospital after previous rounds of chemo.

 This relapse was unexpected. Even the doctors said that although the cancer had returned, a 40,000 dollars surgery could save her life.

 I didn't have it, so I had no choice but to ask Miguel for help.

 To get that money, I called Miguel more than a hundred times.

 But every time I brought up money, he'd brush me off, annoyed. ""Why are you telling me? Go talk to Leticia.""

 And every time I went to Leticia, she'd look at me with that same regretful expression.

 ""Sorry, Ms. Haston. 40,000 dollars isn't a small amount. Let me think about it.""

 And so Leticia kept ""thinking"" for half a month.

 Until today, when the doctor told me Mom couldn't hold on any longer, and I had to make a decision.

 That's when I finally made my way up to the top floor to see Miguel.

 I thought if I begged him in tears, he'd say yes.

 But I never got the chance. Miguel cut me off before I could speak, snapping, ""Do you think my money grows on trees? You think I can just throw 40,000 dollars your way whenever you ask?""

 I stood there, shattered.

 He didn't even look at me. He just told Leticia to show me out.

 I wiped my tears, a bitter smile on my lips, and got in the cab without glancing back.

 The next three days were a blur, filled with Mom's funeral.

 I cried so hard every day that I could barely breathe. The whole world knew my mom was gone.

 Except Miguel.

 We weren't even following each other on Instagram.

 He never introduced me to his friends, and he never bothered to meet mine.

 Miguel, as a multimillionaire, every minute of his time is worth thousands. He'd never waste a second scrolling through my Instagram.

 He didn't just miss the news of my mom's death—he didn't even know she died because I couldn't afford her surgery.

 Staring at Mom's photo on her headstone, I pulled out my phone and said to the man on the other end of the line, ""Buy me a ticket for tomorrow night. I've taken care of everything for my mom.""

Chapter 3

 Afterward, I took a taxi back to the house Miguel and I shared.

 The moment I walked in, I saw Miguel sitting on the couch.

 His hair was still damp, beads of water glistening on his chest beneath the open V-neck of his bathrobe.

 This was the Miguel I used to love most.

 Instinctively, I pressed my lips together, just about to step forward, when a sweet, clear voice floated out from the bathroom.

 ""Mr. Peaden, can I blow-dry your hair now?""

 As the words faded, a flash of red emerged from the bathroom.

 I turned my head and locked eyes with Leticia.

 When my gaze landed on her bright red nightgown, I couldn't help the sneer that curled at my lips.

 That nightgown was the only gift Miguel had ever bought for me with his own money.

 I'd cherished it so much that since he gave it to me, I'd only worn it once.

 But now, unbelievably, she was wearing it.

 I took a deep breath. ""Sorry to interrupt your little rendezvous. Clearly, I came home at the wrong time.""

 I grabbed my suitcase and turned to leave, but Miguel suddenly stormed over and yanked me back, furious.

 ""Kylie, what are you making a scene for now? Leticia and I got caught in a downpour while visiting some properties, so we came back to the villa to change.""

 Honestly, I tried to hold it together. After all, in four days, I'd be marrying someone else.

 I'd only come back to resign from my job and officially break up with Miguel.

 I didn't care what Miguel and Leticia did outside, but I couldn't stomach Miguel letting Leticia parade around in my nightgown, in the home I once thought was mine, before we'd even ended things.

 ""So you're saying those love bites on her neck aren't yours?""

 That nightgown was sheer, meant to be sexy. I could see the marks Leticia tried to hide beneath the thin fabric.

 Miguel's face flickered with panic.

 Leticia spoke up, perfectly composed. ""Ms. Haston, any marks on my body are my own business. They have nothing to do with you, and you have no right to ask.

 ""If you think my presence bothers you, I'll stay away from this villa. But I hope you'll stop storming out every time something upsets you. Do you realize how busy Mr. Peaden is? You keep causing drama, but he's only human—he gets tired too.""

 Leticia, with her elite degree, had managed to paint me as unreasonable in just a few sentences.

 Swallowing the pain rising in my chest, I was about to snap back when Miguel cut in, his face cold. ""Kylie, apologize to Leticia right now. She's my assistant, not your emotional punching bag.

 ""I expect you to stop testing my limits over and over.""

 I looked at Miguel, pale but smiling bitterly.

 ""Miguel, if you think I'm going to apologize, you're dreaming.""

Chapter 4

 After that, I stormed off to my room, dragging my suitcase behind me.

 Miguel, almost as if he wanted to punish me, didn't come to my room that night.

 Thinking about it, a bitter smile crept onto my lips.

 I might have been Miguel's girlfriend, but I felt more like his mistress.

 He could walk into my room anytime he pleased.

 But if I wanted to see him, I had to knock, wait for permission, and only enter if he allowed it.

 If he was in a bad mood, he wouldn't even bother to answer me—not even a simple ""I'm busy.""

 But honestly, that suited me just fine now.

 With only four days left until my wedding, I had no desire to spend any more time around him.

 The next morning, I woke up to find Miguel already at the breakfast table.

 He pointed to a glass of milk. ""You've always had stomach issues, right? I asked Doreen to heat up some milk for you.""

 This was Miguel's usual way of making peace.

 In the past, I'd always take the milk and drink it all at once, just to give him an easy way out—even though I hated milk.

 But this time, I didn't reach for the glass. Instead, I called out to our housekeeper, Doreen.

 ""Doreen, could you please get me oatmeal?""

 Miguel pushed the milk toward me again.

 ""All I wanted last night was for you to apologize to Leticia. Why are you being so dramatic?

 ""She is my right hand. You know I can't lose her. If you storm off and leave, how am I supposed to get any work done?""

 His eyes softened, and my chest tightened instinctively.

 Miguel and I met during my internship—he was the boss, and I was the new intern at the company.

 I didn't even know who he was when I asked him to press the elevator button for my department while I was picking up coffee for the team.

 After that, I started receiving flowers every few days, until a month later Miguel called to invite me to dinner.

 He was a perfect gentleman when we first met at a five-star hotel—charming, witty, and cultured. That night, I was completely swept off my feet.

 Six months later, I moved into his villa.

 Our first year together was pure happiness.

 He'd bake pastries for me himself, and if I caught a cold, he'd rush home from meetings just to take care of me.

 Because we wanted to keep things private, whenever I worked late, he'd stay at the office too. We'd sneak into his office to share midnight snacks and stolen kisses, like two conspirators.

 I know Miguel used to love me madly.

 But ever since Leticia became his secretary, even a gentle look from him has become a luxury.

 I forced a smile and said quietly, ""If you can't live without Leticia, why not marry her? Put her name on the deed—wouldn't that be safest?""

 Miguel's impatience was obvious. I didn't need to guess what he'd say next—probably another lecture about how I was being unreasonable.

 So I decided to speak first. ""Miguel, I think we shou—""

 Before I could finish, Leticia walked in from outside the villa.

 ""Mr. Peaden, it's eight o'clock. We need to leave for the office now.""

 Miguel immediately stood, face cold, grabbed his suit jacket, and followed her out.

 It felt like punching a pillow—no pain, but enough to suffocate.

Chapter 5

 Not long after Miguel and Leticia left, I grabbed my bag and headed to the office as well.

 The moment I arrived, my supervisor called me into his office.

 He handed me a performance review, looking helpless.

 ""Kylie, I'm really sorry. I did everything I could. I was sure after I resigned, my position would go to you. But upper management shut down my recommendation without a second thought.""

 I looked at our department manager, Gordon Patrick, and saw the guilt flicker in his eyes.

 Calmly, I pulled out my resignation letter. ""Mr. Patrick, it's alright. I've already decided to leave.""

 Gordon stared at me in disbelief. ""You're really quitting? You've worked here for ten years, always so dedicated, solving problem after problem for this company. And now you're leaving.""

 A bitter smile tugged at my lips.

 But that's exactly why I had to go—ten years of hard work, and I never got anything I truly wanted.

 Miguel once promised me that if I made it to Operations Manager, he'd take me home to meet his family, and we'd get married.

 I believed him.

 I worked overtime relentlessly. I pushed myself to deliver results.

 But no matter how hard I tried—even when I ranked first in performance, first in every review—the Operations Manager seat changed hands again and again, but it was never mine.

 I confronted Miguel about it countless times, but he'd always just look at me coldly.

 ""Kylie, if you can't get that position, it means you're not good enough. You should reflect on what you need to improve, instead of whining to me.""

 That was the first time I felt truly numb.

 Besides wanting to marry Miguel, I desperately wanted recognition for my work.

 Maybe the pain in my chest was too much; I couldn't hold back my tears.

 Afraid to show my weakness in front of Gordon, I hurriedly stood up. ""Sorry, Mr. Patrick, I need to use the restroom.""

 My sobs mixed with the sound of the toilet flushing in the bathroom.

 It was only then that I realized just how much I'd endured, how much I'd resented these ten years with Miguel.

 While I hid in the bathroom, crying, voices drifted in from outside the door.

 ""I heard Mr. Patrick from Operations is quitting, and he recommended Kylie for Operations Manager.""

 ""Ms. Burton, others might not know, but everyone in the secretarial office does—Mr. Peaden promised Kylie that if she made Operations Manager, he'd marry her.""

 Leticia let out a cold laugh.

 ""Kylie? That idiot thinks she deserves to marry Mr. Peaden? Relax. I stopped her from becoming Operations Manager before, and I'll do it again.

 ""That stubborn fool, Kylie. I've blocked her year-end bonus more than once just to force her out, but she's managed to hang on every time.""

Chapter 6

 A surge of hatred shot through my chest.

 All these years at the company, every employee who performed well got a generous year-end bonus.

 Every long-term staff member saw their pay increase with seniority—except me.

 I was still stuck at entry-level wages.

 That's why, when Mom got sick, and I couldn't afford her treatment, I ended up begging Miguel for money in tears.

 I never imagined Leticia was behind it all.

 Furious, I threw open the bathroom door and stormed out. ""Leticia, it was you, wasn't it? You've been skimming my wages all these years!

 ""If you want Miguel, just say so! I'd step aside. Why did you have to sabotage me behind my back?""

 I was so angry that I slapped Leticia hard across the face.

 Her cheeks flushed with rage.

 Just as I thought she'd slap me back, she suddenly dropped to her knees.

 ""Ms. Haston, I know you're Mr. Peaden's girlfriend. I can't afford to cross you, but I can avoid you, can't I? I'll resign today. Please, just stop bullying me, don't hit me anymore. I'm sorry, I admit I was wrong, just let me go.""

 I stared at her, stunned.

 The next moment, a cold voice rang out from the hallway.

 ""Kylie, what are you doing? This is a workplace, not a place for your tantrums. Apologize to Leticia right now.""

 Miguel strode over, his face full of concern as he helped Leticia to her feet.

 ""Are you alright? Where did she hit you? I'll take you to the hospital right now.""

 Leticia sobbed and collapsed into Miguel's arms.

 ""Mr. Peaden... I'm fine... It's all my fault. I shouldn't have vetoed Ms. Haston's application for Operations Manager. She has every right to blame me.

 ""I just couldn't stand how she's thrown her weight around all these years, acting like she owns the place because she's a senior employee—even Mr. Patrick has to tiptoe around her. Now Mr. Patrick's quitting because of her.

 ""And she even threatened Mr. Patrick, forced him to vouch for her so she could get the Operations Manager job. I just didn't want her to turn the department into chaos, so I had no choice but to reject her application.

 ""But I never expected Ms. Haston would come after me in the bathroom and hit me.""

 Miguel's expression darkened, his gentle hand on Leticia's back before he turned on me in anger.

 ""Kylie, did you really think that if you became Operations Manager, I'd marry you? Take a look at yourself—do you really think you're good enough for me?

 ""For ten years, I've fed you, clothed you. Did you really think you were some high-society wife? Go to HR and process your resignation. Get out of my company.""

 A mocking smile twisted my lips.

 So this was what Miguel really thought.

 From beginning to end, he'd only ever seen me as a mistress, never a girlfriend.

 Honestly, I'd known the answer for a long time—I just didn't want to admit it.

 Tears slipped down my cheeks. I wiped them away calmly and handed over my resignation.

 ""No need for you to kick me out, boss. I'll leave on my own. Here's my resignation letter.""

Chapter 7

 I had never called Miguel ""boss"" before.

 So when that distant word slipped out, it hit him hard that he couldn't help but furrow his brow.

 He was just about to say something when Leticia's whimpering broke the silence.

 ""Mr. Peaden, I'm feeling a little dizzy. Could you please take me to the hospital?""

 Miguel instantly returned to his usual cold detachment.

 I gave a bitter laugh, shook my head, and walked out of the bathroom.

 Ten years of love—finally over.

 I went straight back to Miguel's villa, pulled out my suitcase, and started packing my things.

 But after all that sorting, everything that truly belonged to me only filled two suitcases.

 The rest—bags, jewelry—had all been picked out by Leticia, tailored to her tastes, not mine.

 Especially when I found the men's ring tucked away in the corner of my vanity, I couldn't hold back my tears.

 That ring was my dad's keepsake. I'd once given it to Miguel.

 Miguel accepted it, but I'd never seen him wear it.

 Then one day, I happened to see it tossed in the trash bin in his study, and I knew then that there was no future for us.

 Once everything was packed, I hauled my suitcases downstairs.

 Just as I reached the villa's front door, I ran into Miguel coming home.

 He frowned at me. ""Running away again? You stormed out just a couple of days ago and came slinking back. Aren't you tired of this little routine?""

 A mocking smile crossed my lips.

 So, during those three days after Mom died, Miguel thought I was just sulking.

 No wonder he never called to ask about me.

 No wonder his face was dripping with contempt when I came back.

 I looked at him calmly. ""Miguel, let's break up.""

 Just then, the taxi pulled up. I didn't care how dark his expression was as I stuffed my bags in the trunk and opened the car door.

 Right before I left, Miguel called out coldly.

 ""Kylie, if you walk out this time, I won't let you come back. I won't allow you to keep pushing my limits.""

 I shot him a scornful look. ""Miguel, don't worry. Even if I die, I'll never come back.""

 With that, I climbed into the car and pulled the door shut.

1q3sy46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3sy46,Reitti v3.1.0: A year of self-hosting my location history (1.1k stars and 46 releases later),"Hey everyone, I’m Daniel.

On June 5, 2025, I pushed `v1.0.0` of **Reitti**. My goal was personal: I wanted to track my movements so that I could look back a year later and easily bring back memories of where I had been and what I had done. I wanted that ""Time Machine"" feeling, but I didn't want to hand my entire life's history over to another entity to get it.

Today, exactly 213 days and **46 releases** later, I’m releasing **v3.1.0**.

The journey from a personal hobby to a community project has been wild:

* **1,191 Stars** on GitHub.
* **404 Commits** to main with **311 PRs** merged.
* **250 Issues** closed.
* **9 Languages** supported.

# What is Reitti?

""Reitti"" is Finnish for ""route"" or ""path."" It’s a personal location tracking and analysis application. It is **fully local and private** and no data ever leaves your server. You own the database, and you own the memories.

# The Year in Review: Major Milestones

To reach that goal of ""bringing back memories,"" we had to build some serious infrastructure this year:

* **The Memories Feature:** This was the soul of the project this year. We moved beyond just ""rows of data"" to create beautiful travel logs that combine raw GPS data with images, text notes, and visit summaries.
* **Deterministic Visit Detection:** I’ve rewritten the processing pipeline multiple times. Handling raw GPS data is a struggle, debugging is a nightmare when one single ""bounced"" coordinate out of 10,000 can break a visit logic. We moved to a unified, deterministic engine to ensure your logs are accurate and noise-free.
* **Advanced Sharing & Federation:** We implemented ""Magic Links"" for external sharing, added sharing your data to other users and added support for cross-instance sharing, allowing you to see live locations on a single map of all your friends and family members.

# New in v3.1.0:

* **Polygon Boundaries for Places:** Move beyond simple circular radiuses; define exact shapes for your significant places.
* **OwnTracks Friend Data Support:** Seamlessly integrate and view data from your friends directly in your OwnTracks App.
* **Docker Secrets Support:** Hardening security for your self-hosted setup.
* **Dutch Language Support:** Now supporting our 9th language!

**Full v3.1.0 Release Notes:** [https://github.com/dedicatedcode/reitti/releases/tag/v3.1.0](https://github.com/dedicatedcode/reitti/releases/tag/v3.1.0)

# A Heartfelt Thank You

This project isn't just me anymore. I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who contributed this year. To the **15 contributors** on GitHub who touched the code, and to the countless others who:

* Helped translate Reitti into 9 languages.
* Filled detailed issues and bug reports.
* Suggested features that shaped the direction of the app.
* Supported the project indirectly by sharing it with others.

You are the reason this project stayed healthy for 46 releases and I am looking forward what we can achieve in 2026

# What’s Next?

I’m currently focusing on usability, mostly polishing the date selection and adding more configuration options. Long-term, I want to expand the **Memories** feature, possibly exploring local AI to help turn raw coordinate logs into natural-language travel diaries to make looking back even easier.

# Development Transparency

I use AI as a development tool to accelerate certain aspects of the coding process, but all code is carefully reviewed, tested, and intentionally designed. AI helps with boilerplate generation and problem-solving, but the architecture, logic, and quality standards remain entirely human-driven.

I appreciate your feedback and support! Here are a few ways to connect:

currently im not doing well, not bad, not good either. im really prone to spiraling, doom scrolling and overthinking for hours. every night para akong naddrain. during bakasyon i tried reconnecting ti my hobbies and interests. routine ko sa umaga, i make my coffee with my espresso machine which i rly enjoy the process of. sa gabi, i learned to play with random people online and it is a good way to distract kasi nagkakaron akong friends and pampalipas oras talaga. if not, me and my cousin will go walking outside and buy food (malapit lang ang park sa bahay namin) my dogs are also at home 

these past few weeks, these activities are what kept me happy and good mood at night.

ngayon sa dorm mawawala yan, di ako pwede lumabas pag gabi kasi i have curfew at 10pm, dorm wifi restricts online games (other than that di ako pwede mag ingay because i have room mates, and my room mates have their own world.) and im likely not gonna get back on my hobbies. ayoko malungkot huhu 

movies, and journaling only work SOMETIMES. my thoughts are louder huhuu

1q3swkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q3swkh/what_to_do_when_brain_and_body_are_tired/,what to do when brain and body are tired,"I am trying to find something to replace scrolling for when I have little energy. So far, what I can come up with is just staring at the ceiling, which is honestly fine. But I’m wondering what other people do? I read the activities list, but I already do a lot of the things on it, and the ones I don’t do sound overwhelming and exhausting to do first thing in the morning or when my brain and body are already fried. 

I already read, do yoga, strength train at the gym, walk my dogs, go skiing in winter and cycling or hiking in summer/fall, volunteer once per month at the food bank, go to church a few times per month, call my family once per week, garden, do housework/cleaning/chores/errands, and I picked up ASL to learn/practice to try to get me off of mindlessly scrolling. I also like playing video games. I’d like to spend more time exercising, but it feels like I’m pushing my body to the limit already. 

I am wondering what to do and what people do in moments where you just need down time. For instance, I woke up too early this morning and couldn’t go back to sleep. My body is very sore from working out all week and skiing yesterday so I don’t want to immediately exercise, I will be going to yoga or the gym later, but I just feel like being lazy and cozy. I don’t want to do my housework yet since I’m so go-go-go that I’d just like some rest in bed for a bit before I get up and tackle all the activities of the day. So that leaves other hobbies like ASL or reading, but that feels like it takes *so* much energy that I don’t have right now. I will later, but right now I’m just lazy, cozy, brain dead, and adding one more thing to *do* is the last thing I want to do.

What do people do in these moments? Is there something passive that takes the same amount of effort as scrolling or at least minimal brain power? Again, I guess I could stare at the ceiling and I think that would be good for me, but looking for other creative suggestions and wondering what people do to replace the morning ease into the day. I guess it’s like my version of reading the paper with your coffee before you get your day started….. maybe I should start getting physical newspapers? Idk, please help!

I’m trying to think of what I did pre phones and the computer, but i don’t think I ever had a before, really. My parents worked super hard but didnt take care of themselves, so they’d come home from work, nap, and watch television. I never had any hobbies in childhood as a result except reading, watching tv, and going online. I was born in 1991 and honestly grew up on the internet with unlimited access to everything. When I try to think of what I did in middle school and high school before school, I would watch cartoons or music videos. Anyway I need help! 

Also, I have severe ADHD, so I definitely think I am more vulnerable to the dopamine hit from scrolling. 

Maybe sudoku or crosswords or something in a physical paper book? I bought a prompted journal for moments like this, but I just sit there staring at it if I don’t have energy/brain power. But maybe that’s just a matter of training my brain and I should push through it?

I’m looking to buy a fully automatic espresso machine and I’m currently deciding between the De’Longhi Rivelia EXAM440.35.B and the Philips 2200 EP2224/10.

I mainly drink espresso and coffee, occasionally milk drinks (I don’t mind using a seperate electric milk frother). What matters most to me is:

* Coffee taste and consistency
* Ease of use & maintenance
* Reliability / longevity
* Overall value for money

The De’Longhi seems more advanced (more settings, bean switch system, nicer display), but it’s also quite a bit more expensive. The Philips 2200 looks simpler and cheaper, but I’m wondering how it compares in real-world use over time.

For those who have owned or used one (or both):

Which one would you recommend and why?

I’ve started noticing the small things more. Morning light through the window. Making coffee slowly. Realizing I handled a hard day on my own and I’m still okay.

Living alone hasn’t made me less connected. It’s made me more intentional. I reach out because I want to, not because I’m trying to fill space.

Hi everyone, and Happy New Year! I’d like to get some advice — maybe someone has been in a similar situation.

I’m currently using a 1Zpresso K-Ultra and a Breville Bambino. I’ve already done basically all the available upgrades to improve shot quality, and the only thing left to try is different baskets — I’ve ordered a Normcore high extraction basket.

I’ve been using this setup for about 2 years. My birthday is coming up this month, and I’d like to treat myself with an upgrade.

I usually drink 2–3 Americanos a day. I buy beans from a local roaster. For a long time, I preferred washed Ethiopian coffees. However, occasionally I bought beans from local supermarkets (Kicking Horse, Lavazza, Melitta). Most of the time they’re awful and stale, but a couple of times I got fresh bags, and I noticed something interesting: I actually started enjoying richer, more chocolatey coffees with a fuller body.

My “ideal” coffee is something Americano-sized in volume, but very intense — like the equivalent of 3–4 double espresso pulls (half joking, but I think you get what I mean: I’m chasing density and body).

I’ve been thinking a lot about what I actually want to improve.

Path 1 — Grinder upgrade first

Hand grinding 2–3 shots a day isn’t terrible, but I’d really like to automate the process. If I’m upgrading to an electric grinder, I feel that to get a noticeable jump, I’d want grind-by-weight.

Grinders I’m considering:

* Baratza Sette 270Wi (\~900 CAD) - questionable gearbox.
* Eureka Mignon Libra (\~1050 CAD)
* Fiorenzato AllGround Sense (\~1450 CAD)
* Eureka Atom W 65 (\~1850 CAD) - really like it, but it’s out of my budget

My budget is around 1000 CAD. Not sure if stretching it further makes sense.

Path 2 — Stretch budget to \~2500 CAD and upgrade both grinder & machine

There are some interesting bundles at KitchenBarista, for example:

* Profitec Go + Eureka Mignon Specialita

This would be a bigger jump overall, but also a much bigger spend.

Path 3 — DF64 Gen 2

Buy a DF64 Gen 2 (\~450 CAD), stop there for now, and take time to understand where I really want to go next — and whether I even want to. Potentially save up for a serious espresso machine upgrade in a few years: better temperature and pressure control, better UX, build quality, and aesthetics. I absolutely love the design of machines like ECM Classika or ECM Mechanika Heritage Edition.

The big question:

What would give the most dramatic jump in performance for my preferences?

By the time I uploaded the YouTube video and finished journaling it was already 3am. Staying up this late and looking at screens is having a big impact on my sleep I think. I felt like I was awake the entire time, but when I check my phone this morning it was already almost 11am. I'm sure being back on coffee isn't helping either.

I got up and did my meditation and then I went to Riverbar to write out my goals and to get a good ping picture of my coffee so I can send it out to girls. It is a pretty good photo. I sent it to Allison and she i going to meet me in about 10 minutes here at Jimmy' On The Mall. We will see how she is feeling. I think I got a ton of investment from her because I approached and because her Tinder date was lame.

At Riverbar I went over my goals and gratitude and did more Reddit outreach. There are a lot of guys who are struggling with dating profiles, confidence, neediness and just getting on dates in general. I need to figure out a better way to market because I know I can help these guys. I will continue to post daily on there and do whatever I can.

My youTube has not been going very well the last week. I am getting no new subscribers and I am actually losing some. I think some of this is because I am focusing more on taking action and building yourself. I noticed that guys like Rich Cooper and MenMustSpeakUp get a ton of views, but it is alway complaining about women rather than ever taking responsibility and I never really see them giving guys action steps to get the dating life they want. These guys can delude themselves all they want, but I guarantee they would love to have women in their life.

Part of the problem is that I am not preparing for these videos at all. I am so focused on my 60 day challenge and getting my approaches in that by the time I get home from it or dates it is already 11pm. I am dedicated to posting a video everyday, 10 approaches and journaling, but it takes a lot of time away from making videos, content and stuff I can sell for the business. I still think this is the most important thing I can do right now though. I must get this area of my life handled so I can help other guys do the same thing. Tom Torero mentioned that all these life coaches and helping with divorce recovery, etc all comes back to dating coaching. I agree with this. The whole reason I recovered from divorce was so I could have an epic dating life. It is what helped me become a man who gives girls great experiences and gives me the courage to go and approach girls in the street. I love being this man. It feels like a super power

Allison should be showing up soon so I will have this date and then will go out and do my approaches for the day. Plan is date, approaches and then record a podcast... that I didn't prepare for. Again it is more important to get the dating life handled. I think it will pay dividends in the long run with stories, journals and possible books. I hope it is the right decision

The date with Allison was quite interesting. She came to Jimmy's and we seemed to hit it off pretty quickly again. She mentioned she called in sick to work which is why we met there. She was fun and playful and we had a pretty good vibe. She is also very attractive as well. I was glad that she came out. We got to know each other for a bit and I got to find out a bit about her Tinder date. She mentioned that the guy was French and younger and that he didn't know how to setup the date or lead the conversation. She said his English wasn't the best, but that shouldn't stop you from leading the interaction. She did say she liked how I stopped her and how I showed intuitive.

I think the date was going very well. There was a lot of playfulness, she would ask me questions about myself and I kept teasing her here and there. We stayed at Jimmy's for about and hour and I didn't want things to get stale so I decided we should go for a walk. I had my backpack with me and wanted to drop it off, but she didn't want to go back towards the house because she didn't want to be seen by work. I started walking us to the park and again we had a good fun and playful energy. There was a market going on as we were walking in, and I was teasing her about needing to get a hat to stand out and for the future grandkids. She was playing along and we were having fun.

We got to a park bench and I didn't want to just keep walking. I wanted to try to start escalating. This felt like a good opportunity to sit next to her and to start seeing where I was with the attraction. I touched her back and left my arm there while we talked. She seemed to be ok with it, but I may have left it there a bit too long. The connection seemed pretty good so I went for a kiss. I got a kiss on the lips, but then she said she didn't feel good about herself and that she wasn't really ready for physical touch.

I backed off and we started talking about how she was a bad influence on me and that I was an innocent shy boy. She kept saying I was cheeky and not shy, which was nice to hear. She did say that she is a bad influence though because she shoplifts and she drinks sometimes too much with her co-workers. Apparently it's pretty easy to shoplift here in Australia. I dug into what she steals, but looking back I should have said I don't approve of it. I would never steal from a store and wouldn't want to be around her if she was stealing. I should have made this a boundary and pushed her away a bit. In reality I don't care what she does, but I know I wouldn't do it.

At one point she asked me what I was looking for, and I said I wanted someone to travel with, have crazy spontaneous experiences with and who likes the same things as me. It was around this time that she said part of her wants to stay, but another part of her wants to go. I wonder if this triggered it, because she is not able to do these things and she mentioned she at some point wants a family. I think I should just say, I'm not really sure what I want right now. My life is pretty day by day at the moment and I want to meet someone I connect with and see what happens. That is more honest because in reality I won't be ready for a girlfriend for probably another year.

I said if she wants to go that is fine, it is no big deal. We got up and I walked with her until I got to the bathroom. She continued to walk home and then I went to get Subway, as I haven't eaten yet today. I got a message from her saying she wasn't ready for touch and that something was probably wrong with her. I sent a text saying it was no big deal and that I thought we had a good vibe.

Once the date was done I came back to the apartment to get George and we went out and did some Daygame. Both of us have made quite a bit of progress in the last 2 weeks. I haven't had any sexual experiences this week outside of mayo, which is much less than last week, but I still feel I am making progress. I got 8 phone numbers in the last two days and as I am sitting here, one of the Korean girls messaged me back. Feels good to have abundance.

We went out around 5pm and got back at 9pm. I got my 10 sets done and I felt pretty fun and flirty in a few of the sets. I don't really want to break them down right now so I will just post my notes.I forgot to message two of the girls I got numbers from and will probably just move on and find new leads tomorrow.

Once we got back from the approaches we went and did the sauna and then I recorded the podcast and now writing the journal. Seems pretty much impossible for me to get to bed before 2am with this challenge, but we will see what happens.

I am feeling good with the challenge. I can see the improvements in my game and building attraction. One of the things I am noticing is that I am not hesitating anymore and I just go in because i know I need to get these sets done. I am also noticing that there are hardly any 10's out in Australia. Tom Torero mentions that in places like Russia and the Baltics they are everywhere. George and I saw a bunch in Bali, but it is super rare here. I plan on doing a few months here and then going somewhere that has many more hot girls. I need to look for a home base.

Overall it was an interesting day. I spent most of the last few days focused entirely on gaming. I really struggle if this is the right thing to do, but I really need to get this area of my life handled.

**What went well today:**

1. I was fun and playful on the date and was able to led it, making Allison feel comfortable and feminine
2. 10 approaches, video released on YouTube, journal
3. Will get to bed before 2am

**What can be improved:**

1. Stay in sets longer even if the girl doesn't give you anything. Make her leave
2. It would be good to focus on work
3. Don't spend money on eating out and coffee

**Approaches:**

1. I opened the girl at the restaurant. I said she had a very interesting accent and that she looked Italian or French. She is from Brazil. We had a good conversation about how she learned English. It was a pretty decent set. I tried to show intense saying she was cute, but she didn’t understand . Felt good to just be social though.
2. I tried to stop a Korean looking girl, but I stopped her from the side and then stopped. I think I need to just stop them from the front. Jorge said not to, but I don’t see another way. I need them to stop so that I can give them to complement 
3. I saw a cute girl walking down the street. She went into the chemist warehouse before I could approach her out there I went direct and said she looked very nice. It was a good conversation and I use the vacuum to say that I had just moved here and then she asked where I was from . She is from Korea. She’s been here for a few years. I offered to take her out for a drink, she has a boyfriend, though that she has been dating for a few months, so she did not want to do that to her boyfriend because he would be upset which I understand.
4. Stopped the Korean girl who was walking in front of me. I did the front stop and she kept walking so I could do that better. I think I was hesitant because she is Asian and Jorge said not to stop them from the front. I did get her to stop by just continuing to talk. I did an exotic read And said she was from Korea or Japan. She is from Tawain We had a very good conversation. She just got done doing a tour around Brisbane to see the clock and stuff. She said it was boring. It was very flirty and fun. I told her I did not want to be her friend when she offered to give me her Instagrambut overall a very good set. I will send her a message and we will see about getting her out because she loves coffee. I did offer to take her to coffee for an instant date, but she said she was not feeling very social and she was going to go eat a bagel
5. Tried to stop a girl who was sitting on the bench. I said she looked exotic and she pretty much ignored me. She said she was married and walked away. I think she was very shy and probably was married so I just left
6. Saw a cute girl walking by was hesitant to open her because she looked kind of young, but then I saw the tattoo she is from Germany. She is here on a visa for a month and then we’ll go and travel to Sydney and then we’ll go back to Germany. The conversation was a bit playful, but she was not investing a lot. She did ask where I was from which was good I did not just fill in the space like I do normally I said I would like to take her out another time and she said she was not looking for that so there is probably more attraction I could have done.
7. I saw a girl in a yellow top walking by earlier, but she went into a store so I didn’t open her. I saw her again while she was walking and I decided I would go in. I wanted to get my sets done. She was very receptive at first she was a bit hesitant, but I called red and she is actually from Taiwan. We had a good conversation. I was playful with her and we connected over running . She started asking me questions of where I was from. I made sure to see going for a date and she does not drink much and she is training for a marathon so it sounds like we could have a good time. I said I would shoot her a message and we would go from there. She said she was very happy after I opened her
8. I was on my way to take a picture of George and I saw a cute girl who was in workout outfits that look like she made eye contact. I opened her with the front stop very direct. I said she looked like she was from Argentina, which she was the conversation was very fun and flirty. I use the vacuum again to not tell her where I was from. She actually hooked and asked me . She  tried to get me to exchange Instagram’s, but I told her I did not want to do that. I would send her a WhatsApp message and if she wants to come out, she can come out and maybe her boyfriend would be dead one day and she would want to flirt with a handsome American and she laughed.
9. Was walking in Southbank heading home with Jorge saw a cute girl who was working out stopped her from the front. It turned out to be the Italian girl. I stopped down here just the other day. She was very receptive and happy to talk to me. I teased her quite a bit. It was just a fun flirty conversation . She still had her boyfriend. I just made sure she knew my intentions and didn’t really do much else overall great glad I could give her some energy. She thanked me again for stopping her.
10. Girl sitting on the bench by herself decided I would go in. I said she looked very nice and then I said she had a creative look and she said she worked at the coffee shop. I tried to build some attraction but couldn’t get much traction with it. ",2,1767540413.0,TheUnstoppableMan,0,1.0,False
1q3smum,https://www.reddit.com/r/StatementOfPurpose/comments/1q3smum/need_urgent_help_for_masters_in_financial/,Need urgent help for Masters in Financial Economics SOP,"Hi everyone,

I am reaching out for urgent support with reviewing my SOP for Master's in Financial Economics. Since the deadline is soon, would truly appreciate if someone can critically analyze my first draft and help me finalize it. Happy to provide any other information if needed.

*While working with a cleantech advisory firm on climate finance projects, I observed that finance is not merely a supporting function, but is the central lever that determines whether global climate ambitions translate into action and scaled, or remain unrealised. Understanding how private capital and concessional finance can be mobilised at scale for clean transitions in developing countries has since become the key area I wish to explore.*

*Graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the xx in 2023, I am rigorously trained in economic theory, mathematical methods, statistics, and econometrics. I found myself particularly drawn to macroeconomics, especially monetary policy and open-economy frameworks, mainly to understand how financial systems interact with real economies. To further deepen this interest, I pursued electives such as Money and Financial Markets, which strengthened my understanding of financial institutions, market behaviour and financial instruments.*

*Working at a cleantech advisory firm as a Consultant, my work has spanned climate finance, clean energy, and climate resilience assessments. I have supported the assessments of delivery mechanisms being deployed for clean hydrogen projects under the UK A2D Facility; contributed to the design of a National Sustainable Energy Investment Plan for São Tomé and Príncipe, and worked on designing investment framework to enhance climate resilience coffee sector in Tanzania. These experiences exposed me to the challenges faced in mobilising climate finance, particularly the risk perceptions, return expectations, and institutional constraints that often deter private investments.*

*Engaging with stakeholders ranging from Ministries of Energy, multilateral development banks and other international donors helped me understand that financial structures, risk allocation, and design of incentives play an important role in determining whether projects are implemented and sustained. In the coming five years, I aim to work with development banks, multilateral institutions and climate funds, impact investment firms to help mobilize funds and design funding structures for climate resilient interventions in developing countries. In particular, I hope to support the structuring of blended finance mechanisms and risk-mitigation instruments that can crowd in private capital for climate-resilient infrastructure assignment. I also hope to engage with the initiatives such as Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance in India, to support the design of innovative financial instruments to scale cleantech solutions.*

*The MSc in Financial Economics at University xx will provide an ideal academic foundation for my career goal. The curriculum has a strong emphasis on macroeconomics, international finance, and risk management which will train me for the analytical demands of climate finance and development banking. I am keen to study electives such as Financial Crises and Risk Management, International Finance, and Macrofinance, as these courses will strengthen my understanding of capital flows, financial institutions and instruments, and decision-making in global markets. The rigorous quantitative training offered by the programme and the interactive way in which the modules are delivered will help me build capacity on how the theoretical models are translated into developing real-life scalable solutions, and will equip me the skills required to engage with the financial institutions to design impactful climate finance solutions.*

*Additionally, I believe that along with the academic training, the world-class faculty and the opportunity to engage with the experts at the Skoll Centre will help me build up on my professional experience, and truly prepare me to engage more meaningfully with financial institutions, assess risk with nuance, and design financing structures that respond to real-world constraints.*",1,1767540346.0,StatementOfPurpose,0,1.0,False

I’ve been curious about Denver for a long time, but have never been to Colorado. I actually applied to DU as a senior in high school in 2013, but decided to go to LA instead. Now, after 13 years in LA and without anything keeping me here in this city, I think this is probably the best time in my life to try life somewhere else as an experiment, and Denver is my #1 on the list of places to consider.

I’ve got a trip in the works to visit for 5 days this February to see what it’s like during the winter time. So i’m posting here to get a sense from people about what it’s like to live in Denver, especially folks who’ve lived in the midwest or in southern california previously. Specifically looking to get a sense of:

1. **How tolerable is the summer weather and winter weather?** I struggle with seasonal depression in Ohio and not so much in southern california. I know Denver is cold like Ohio winters, but sunny like southern california…

2. **How’s the cost of living?** An incentive to relocate to Denver is the lower cost of living, especially on housing, compared to Los Angeles. For context, i’m in an older rent controlled 1bedroom, 600 sq ft without a washer/dryer and i pay $2200/month + all utilities. So housing expenses usually cost me about $2400-$2500/month. I’m hoping to get under $2,000 total if i can.

3. **I dislike the aesthetics/trendiness culture here in LA being used as a metric of one’s social worth. It’s so superficial, and i’ve heard a similar thing exists in Denver, albeit in the form of how outdoorsy/minimalist/one-with-nature one is**. I’m hoping to leave behind that sense of superficialness that can exist in LA but concerned this exists in Denver, albeit not in Gen Z baggy jeans but in the form of hiking boots and skis/snowboards.

4. **I enjoy plants and gardening, the gym, coffee, video games, wood working, being outdoors and going for walks to start my day with a nice brew.** If you can share what you know about businesses, areas, or your thoughts on these hobbies as a Denver local lmk.

Appreciate any info on this stuff and excited to visit your city in the coming weeks!",1,1767540201.0,MovingtoDenver,10,0.56,False
1q3sk3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q3sk3g/emergency_replacement_amateur_looking_for_best/,"Emergency replacement! Amateur looking for best value and gentle learning curve [$1,200]","Good morning everyone. I've spent the last 6+ years using the used Breville BES840XL I purchased used off of Ebay... Well a few weeks ago it started leaking. I thought it was either a failed ""condenser box"" or tubing but never got around to taking it apart until it stopped working properly this morning... turns out it's leaking out of a tube above the pump and I don't think the pump is creating pressure anymore so I'm left without espresso...

Two years ago I had settled on buying an Ascaso Steel Duo because we are used to the instant hot water provided by the thermocoil and the kids use it for hot cocoa. But I bought it on sale through [30.coffee](http://30.coffee) and after 3 months of ""waiting on manufacturer"" I managed to get them to wire me a refund (looking at this forum I'm apparently lucky to have gotten my $1,800 back from them).

Originally, I had a Baratza Encore grinder that I bought 10 years ago for my various pre-espresso coffee adventures (cold brew mostly). But, that thing kicked the bucket 2 years ago and I've been using a [manual conical burr grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6FND4W9) for the past 2 years with decent results with the BES840XL. I would like a single dose grinder but my budget is going to the machine at this point. 

Now that it's an 'emergency' because we don't have espresso here I am. I'm having trouble finding the website that I've seen linked previously that is a really good breakdown of the different options.

Use cases: 

* Basic espresso but interested in improving over the Breville Infuser capability (I have a 58.5mm tamper and screen from when I was buying the Ascaso)
* No steam wand really required (haven't used it more than once in 6 years but I'm pretty sure each machine comes with one)
* Instant hot water for hot cocoa and other purposes (willing to get a different appliance for this)

I was originally against a boiler option because we like the near instant warm-up but I'm open to changing that and using something like a smart plug to time the warmup in the early morning and then the wife will just have to wait for her water to heat up when she wakes up. 

At this point I'm in the 'buy once, cry once' for longevity/reliability with minimal tinkering to dial things in. ",1,1767540166.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I did not tell my parents that i learned the language. I just started greeting ""merhaba"" and responding ""hoş bulduk"" when turkish people say ""hoş geldiniz"" or welcome. 

I always tell them ""gunaydın"". Our bus driver didnt understand english so i tried asking him ""nasılsın"" and he was amazed. I told him that i watch the dizis or the tv series. Our tour guide was amazed too.

In the bus stops when ordering coffee i always ask ""kredit kartla kabul misin?"" And the cashier is amazed too. Didnt bring herself to ask me how i learned but instead asked our driver. How did u i know? Lol they were speaking in their language while looking at me. And at the same time i understood a bit.

We went to this carpet weaving place and whispered to the lady making a carpet ""kolay gelsin"" and she literally stopped working and smiled and thanked me and now she started talking to me in turkish. Hahah. And i helped my parents haggled for a carpet from 2k usd down to 1700usd lira.

My turkish language skill also charmed those turkish leather sellers. Hahha we bought 4 turkish leather jackets and it cost 2700 but discounted at 2495. I asked, can u make it 2400 usd? The store manager said ""since u speak turkish i make it 2400 for you"".

Our tour group mates was amazed how i learned as well. And praised me for learning the language. I am so proud of myself that i was able to connect with the locals and the smiles we put on each others' faces.

Was I the right person to deal with this toxic fake friend?,"I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly, small talk. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""",2,1767539901.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

I'm hour two into what promises to be an entire day of these modules and I'm already on Etsy searching for handmade buckets of acid to shove my head in, because that has to be less painful. 

Unskippable videos on policies, codes, and HIPPA as though they're somehow different than every other hospital. Interactive slideshows and quizzes because of course we had to find a way to make this more annoying and time consuming. Super fun scenarios and case studies teaching me how to do the job you hired me specifically under the assumption I already know how to do it. A 42 page PowerPoint on using a pyxis that really could've used a front page 'click here if you've used a pyxis before' checkbox. Multiple modules on documentation that is never actually relevant to the unit I work on. More interactive modules that require me to click a check box for every single sentence to prove I've read every single sentence, as if I haven't read every single one of these sentences the last time I oriented, and the time before that, and every single other time before that. And can't forget the weirdly drawn animated people giving us affectionate kudos for every question like I need Dora the Explorer to show me violent restraint documentation. 

Can *YOU* spot the *workplace safety violation*!? That's RIGHT! You picked the intoxicated coworker stirring their open coffee cup at the nurses station with a used sharp! MUY BIEN!!

I need orientation bingo boards. Or to schedule my orientations for further than 36 hours after my last block of night shifts. Or to be treated like the competent professional I've been hired to be. 

I'll settle for some crappy coffee and at least one module that covers the info I actually need to know, like parking, type and screen procedures and which bathroom is best to shit in.

I noticed a reply to one of these comments - would you have said the same thing if it was an Indian?

Something similar happened months back where a Kuwaiti dude crashed a European’s vlog in avenues and offered to pay for his coffee and “whatver he needs” . would he have done that for a Filipino ? Or sri lankan?

I'm 100% sold on the concept and purchased lifetime. I'm running into a few edge cases where it's not quite working for me (yet) and a few bugs, and I'm saving those for a post once I'm confident I've completed my migration. (I'm a software product manager by day so I'm trying to consider how I would prefer my own feedback to come to me!) 

However I have two repeating task scenarios I wanted some feedback on to make sure I'm not missing anything while setting up my system. How do I do the two following things in Griply?

1. **Repeat every thirty days:** My dog has a medication that needs to be taken every 30 days. Not every month, not every 4 weeks. Every 30 days. This means it's never consistently on the same day of the month or on the same weekly repeating pattern. Ticktick has an ""Every X Day"" custom repeat task setting that works for this but I can't find a similar setting in Griply.  (side note: I use a shared google calendar reminder for this with my husband, but he is a tech luddite and has a terrible habit of deleting things out of it so I need redundancy in my task planner!)

2. **Postpone a single instance:** For example, Friday mornings are usually pretty tame at work so I like to sit down then for my weekly review over coffee. But sometimes that timing doesn’t always work (traveling, busy work day, etc) and I prefer to postpone a day. It’s not really ‘skipping’ an instance since I don’t want to wait until the next week to do it, i just want to put that one instance off a day without messing the rest of the schedule.

There’s sleep, HRV, resting HR, workouts, trends, etc., but I still end up asking myself:

Why am I tired today?  
What actually messes up my sleep?  
How much rest do I actually need?  
What habits are helping me vs hurting me?

Most of the time I’m just guessing, bouncing between apps, or even pasting numbers into ChatGPT, trying to make sense of it all.

Feels like there should be something that just tells you, in simple language, what your body is reacting to.

Like:  
“You sleep worse when you work out late.”  
“Your HRV drops after coffee in the afternoon.”  
“You recover better when you take 2 rest days.”

Nothing fancy. Just clear, personal stuff.

Humans obsessed with shoes and polished floors  
shopfront windows and queues  
All hyping up the care for bling

material flings  
Can't get their fill from the mundane repetition  
Break off a piece of their coveting envy  
Need they more novelties still

These over here that work on their stroll  
Their scary walk style up  
Knowing their own rhythm  
imitating a stride to hold up their new clothes

We are all just zoo animals  
Aliens in denial  
Awkward struggling to be aware  
of our own reflection inside of ridiculous consumption

She sits there in silent calm  
A human being becoming a shrine  
We struggle down matcha tea  
elegant fingers close on cup

Silence and loud passivity  
Energy of the mall bubbling and popping around her  
Noise doesn't interrupt the magic  
stillness in that smooth presence

Not spiking nor crashing  
Pushing through space a sweet vibration  
a tangible aroma  
A subtle buzz

Unnoticed in the crude blare of each hall  
unnotived among the anxious consumers

 Movement steps to each heartbeat

flip flops scuff and brands scoff

Exhausting cacophony provoking thirst

comments drop  
A nod and a good day  
Thye pick themselves up and leave

Timid and pale skins pinky white  
These stay for a soft piece of cake  
Pretend life is not hard  
Even when it is

You are all transitory birds  
unaware of your migration  
Just looking for your spot  
unable to stick down roots

Cutting them off  
And running right out  
Gleeful hellos and goodbyes  
Clerks with little patience

Service people clenching their teeth  
Multitudes of people moving through  
not one of their desires truly met

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q3rzq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q3rzq9/how_to_get_consistent_shots_breville_barista/,How to get consistent shots? [Breville Barista Touch; built-in Baratza grinder],"I have been using my Breville Barista Touch with the built-in Baratza grinder for over 2 years and have never had any consistency. Shots sometimes taste amazing, 10/10 and other times  over-extracted or under-extracted. I will pull a perfect shot with all the right weight:shot ratios, and then immediately after, my husband will pull a completely different shot using the *exact same settings*.

  
Things we have tried, to no avail:

1. Upgrading the tamper. We went from the standard Breville tamper to a spring-loaded tamper. 
2. Adding a WDT workflow. We started with the Subminimal Flick WDT tool. I thought that my husband and I might have different puck prep techniques, so I recently switched to an Aro Orbit in the hopes of getting more consistency. Doing this has not improved the issue much.
3. Using fresh, consistent beans. We use Perc's DARRRK, usually ordered every 2 weeks. While we love these beans and are happy with them as our daily driver, we love trying different coffees so this has put a bit of a damper on the joy of exploration. This has helped with some of the headache of dialing in because we know the general grind size to use - even if we have to finetune it with every new bag of coffee - but it has not solved the consistency problem. We will get anything from 16g in to 30-50g out on the same grind settings, same shot clock (we play around with this but usually 30s) and same bag of beans. 
4. Using a naked portafilter. To diagnose shots, we switched to a naked portafilter. Results have varied - even when dialed in, one shot will spray all over the countertop, the next one won't. This one has been particularly frustrating because cleaning up coffee all over the countertop is not the first thing either of us want to to do in the morning.
5. Running an empty shot to warm up the machine. I thought the difference might be because the first shot was being pulled on a machine that was not sufficiently warmed up. So I tried running an empty shot first. I also steam milk first, not sure if that changes anything. In any event, this has not noticeably improved the issue.
6. Adjusting the internal burr. We have changed the internal burrs multiple times and landed on 3, which seems to have given us the right range of grind sizes. 
7. Storing beans in a vacuum sealed container. Maybe the difference from day to day was because the beans degraded over time? Nope, hasn't helped.

We have not tried changing the water but honestly don't think this is the issue. Our local tap water is just about right according to those little test strips.

Outside of upgrading (which we are open to), is there anything else we should be doing differently?

At this point, I suspect it's the equipment itself that's the problem, but is it the grinder or the espresso machine? We have read on this sub that it's usually the grinder that is the issue, but have also read about consistency issues / temperature and pressure stability issues with the Breville Barista Touch. 

If we do need to upgrade, which one should we upgrade first? Should we just commit and upgrade both, since I don't love the idea of having a built-in grinder that is essentially useless taking up countertop space? (I know, I know, this sub has recommended against built-in grinders but when I bought this machine I was a complete newbie and had never pulled a shot in my life and valued the convenience and easy learning curve over anything else).",1,1767538764.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

\- - - - -

Harrison took in a deep breath, stretching as much as he could within the confines of being the middle spoon. His bare chest was nearing skin-boiling temperatures, barely surviving as his cool back sapped the excess away. The previous night's stress relief didn’t help the waking-up process, making his hips and legs feel like jelly.

A lazy, reflexive stretch of his giant shark wife had both him and Tracy squeezed into a blanket-covered paste, pushing all the air out of his lungs. He caved in and nuzzled his head back into his guardian’s neck, absently craning up to pepper the underside of her snout with kisses.

The chain reaction of stretching made its way to the third lover, causing her to shuffle around until she was facing him. The half-awake technician one-for-one replicated the cycle of cuddling and smooches.

And so the morning routine of love began in earnest, making the struggle to get out of bed all the more difficult. Small massages and soft whispers beckoned him to stay. Shar’s possessive tail even went so far as to keep him anchored to the ground, but there was too much left unfinished in the settlement for him to be coerced—even if they were damn close to succeeding.

He washed up and got ready, waiting for his lovers to do the same, since they’d asked so sweetly. Plus, three extra pairs of arms and a tail made the shower go a little quicker, despite where they wandered. They got into their clothes for the day, and, much to Tracy’s disappointment, she wasn’t allowed to steal his fur coat.

The next impediment was actually eating breakfast. Harrison assumed he was going just to take whatever Chef left him, but the mess hall had different plans for him, Tracy, and Shar.

The Harvesters, including Rook, were present as expected, given their early-morning work ethic. However, the miners’ weren’t at their usual table; they were sitting with strike-team spears… who weren’t expected to wake up for another hour or two.

Whatever conversation they had going on stopped completely as the door shut behind the engineer. Their heads slowly turned to look at him… each and every one of them. He felt a shiver run down his spine under all their wide eyes.

*“Javelin! What is your team doing up so early this day?”* Shar asked in a friendly manner, breaking the room’s frozen aura.

The paladin walked forward, her unflinching demeanor pushing him to do the same, despite the unsettling moment. The spears looked amongst each other, uncertainty in their gazes. Javelin did not speak.

Rook stood up from her seat and bowed, offering her own explanation. *“The strike team under Captain Javelin's lead had difficulty sleeping last evening and preferred to have an early morning.”*

Harrison’s mind dredged up images from that flesh nightmare a few nights before. He stopped between the two tables of Malkrin, gazing over the mugs of tea and coffee.

Shar verbalized—projected?—the question on his mind. *“Difficulty sleeping? …All of them? Was there something amiss in the dorms?”*

*“It was to my understanding that they had seen—”*

*“The Great War.”* Javelin shot up from her seat, staring intently at the engineer.

“World War One?” Harrison questioned before his mind filled in the blanks. “Wait wait wait, where the hell did you learn about—”

_“What do you mean **ONE**?”_ the yellow-skinned captain exclaimed, slamming four palms on the table as she learned forward.

“Like the one with the trenches on Old-Earth?” Tracy questioned like an air-head, still waking up.

The engineer took in a deep breath and scrubbed his eyes, letting all the air out of his lungs before speaking. “Yes, the one with the trenches… Jav, how did you hear about World War One?”

*“All quiet on the western front,”* the pandora’s box-opener answered quietly, slowly retracting her outburst. *“Is it real?”*

…Oh boy. “The people in the movie? No. The events? Yes. It’s actually pretty realistic in showing the events, if not a little dramatized in the cinematography at times… Depends on if you watched the nineteen-thrities or the twenty-twenty-two version.”

“Of course, you know golden-age history movies, you dork,” Tracy scoffed, elbowing him.

He grabbed both of the technician’s arms, pulled her into his chest, and put her into a jail of his own making to block her out of the conversation. The spears were still astounded, silently watching him with sunken eyes.

“You had nightmares about trench warfare, then,” he asserted when none of them spoke up.

A few slowly nodded out of shame or fear or something else. He sighed and bobbed his head back.

One of the bulkier riflewomen leaned over the table. *“But the seventeen-million? Using purifiers on other star-sent? Those were true things?”*

It was only then that he realized what they probably saw. He recalled a few brutal scenes from the movie in the back of his head. His expression twisted into a cringe just thinking about how the big girls must’ve reacted to a few of the more gruesome and heart-wrenching moments. 

No wonder they couldn’t sleep. At least they would understand a few things, no matter what opinions they formed after watching the film. War wasn’t a good thing. No one wanted it. But, for humans, it was as expected as the sun rising in the morning.

“Yup,” he relented impassively, shaking and gripping Tracy tighter as she tried to bite his pecs in some form of resistance. “First industrialized warfare among peer countries. It’s where most of the military technologies we’re using right now originated from—trench warfare, long-range munitions, and defensive automatic emplacements.”

Javelin stood up straight, crossing her arms over her chest. She still looked wary. *“Is that why you spoke of it only as the first? You continued to fight? How is that possible? There were entire cities without life! Entire regions without flora! What was there to fight for? What had the original war been over?”*

“For the first world war? There are a lot of explanations for why it started in the first place. There was an assassination, political disagreements, and alliances for the main dozen countries or so. Some point to arch duke Franz Ferdinand, others point to the subtle arms race between neighboring countries. A lot of it was the pot boiling over with nationalism and tensions, I think.”*

_“But what could push them to fight again after such death? Would it not take… **hundreds** of generations to repopulate such a number?”_

Harrison sheepishly scratched the back of his neck, feeling a little uncertain about answering everything so straightly. He didn’t want to come off demeaning or that the war didn’t matter, but… “It was over half a millennium ago. And Old-Earth had a larger population than Ershah; there are many more star-sents than Malkrin. So, to the people then, yeah, it was a massive war, hence the name, ‘The Great War.’ There was enough sense of humanity to stop it and rebuild for a time, and there were enough people to repopulate how many had been lost before the next.”

He glanced up at Shar. She didn’t seem troubled in the slightest, given he’d told her about similar things. However, she hadn’t really seen the movie and the depictions of trench warfare in its entirety… Then again, the shark wife had a blood body count higher than he wanted to know, so maybe she wouldn’t even be phased by that either.

Honestly, with what the Malkrin had seen with the things he made on a whim, they should have expected war from humans.

*“So there are that many star-sent that such losses… acceptable?”* Javelin continued, half-curious and half-hesitant. The others around her, both harvester and spear alike, continued to listen intently, hanging on his every word.

Harrison pointedly stared back at the questioner. “I wouldn’t say *acceptable*, really. You watched an anti-war film. It was good at representing war, sure, but its whole point was to emphasize the disconnect between upper-class individuals sending young men—and *boys*—to a war with promises of glory and nationalism and whatever else got more bodies into the meat grinder. It was meant to dissuade the masses from blindly selling their bodies.

“Actually,” he paused, looking down at his technician and pulling her away from his chest. “Why the hell do you have Old-Earth anti-war movies on your laptop downloads?”

Tracy, who actually seemed unhappy to be pulled away from his pecs, shrugged obliviously. “Downloaded the shows I wanted and then a zip file of whatever else was on some pirating website. Colony Overseers didn’t lemme download stuff to the network, so I had to sneak it in somehow.”

His brows pinched together in incredulity and an odd respect. He found another explanation in her response, continuing his monologue to Javelin.

“That’s also another thing I explained to Shar some time ago. It was an arms race. If someone else has someway to kill you easier, you’re going to want to find even better ways just the same. You’ve seen exactly how it played out with the bugs and us, even. For the ‘Great War,’ that turned out very differently. Humans—star-sent—aren’t going to sit down and take losing lightly, especially to the people back then. Not with their egos.”

Most of the Malkrin still just stared at him unsettlingly, doing nothing to settle his nerves. Javelin took his attention with another question.

*“So what of the other great wars after? Were they not exposed to the terrors of trench warfare?”*

The engineer held his voice for a moment, stopping himself from describing the reasons for World War Two, the geopolitical politics sparking the Chinese World War, and the nuclear disaster of the fourth. He needed to nip the conversation in its bud.

“A single film isn’t going to stop generations from repeating the same mistakes. The reasons for fighting and joining the army are… complex,” he explained, trying to corral the conversation into something more reasonable.

Shar put a massive hand on his shoulder and stepped in like an angel, giving Javelin no quarter. *“This should not be the focus of a captain on a frontier settlement’s defense squad. If anything, you should be asking our Creator about what tactics were used to supplement your knowledge. What matter should the star wars have to you in any other way? You should be so lucky as to be able to treat it as history. And, at the very least, find comfort in the proven strength of your weapons and the lengths our Creator is willing to go in securing our foothold on the mainland.”*

The captain faltered, her head falling low. *“I…understand. Forgive me if I was asking too many questions.”*

Harrison paused, glancing up at his towering paladin with scrutiny. “Now, hold on just a minute. I’m not going to go to ‘lengths’ in securing our foothold on the mainland like it's World War One. This is different. *I’m* different. I have absolutely no intentions of sacrificing anyone like the old wars.”

Shar’s ears wilted in a subtle guilt. Her visible emotions spread through him as he felt the eyes of everyone else on him.

The engineer realized he needed them to be completely sure that they *were* different, so he held a hand out to placate them. “Don’t think about what you saw too much. I know that’s easy for me to tell you, but please, just focus on our struggles. Our war. We have an achievable, shared goal, and each of you has a purpose to fulfill. I’m counting on all of you to stand up and fight for something feasible and genuine. You aren’t nameless soldiers. You’re sisters, friends, laborers, and, one day, the mothers of the next generation.”

A glow sparked in the weary eyes of his settlers, inspiring him to strike a chord.

“I care about you. All of you. And not just for the loyalty you’ve sworn. I came here to start a civilization, and by God, that is what I intend to do. So know that your place here, right now, as the shields of your people’s future, isn’t determined by the gun in your hand, but the will in your heart to defend. To protect those who were with you at your lowest and the ones who came here with nothing but the clothes on their back.

“Trust me, for both spears and harvesters, there is a future. And, in the face of the slavery, monsters, and starvation that once threatened you, I promise—”

He clenched his teeth at *that* word, sucking in a tense breath. It took him a moment to find his words, killing the momentum in him. “We will succeed. Your strength is the base of the new world, for both your kind and my own.”

Harrison nodded once, grabbed Tracy by the wrists, and walked toward the kitchen. The brief weight of embarrassment stuck to him, but he was happy to put his thoughts on the table. Most of the spears had heard his heartfelt speech after the first interaction with the paladins a few weeks back, but it was important that they *knew* he always treated them like people and not weapons.

He hoped that his decisions showed that more than his words did.

The near-industrial-sized coffee machine in the corner of the kitchen had already been working its magic for the harvesters… which still had him hesitate for a second

Cera said that coffee was a fine or ‘healthy’ alternative to her sleepless concoction. He had asked her how she knew or if it had any adverse effects. She simply handed him a few papers she kept in the script-keeper’s room and nodded.

A few readings later, and he found out she’d been slowly testing some star-sent components. Whether they were for her brews or just for safety, the Malkrin script didn’t tell. He did figure out she’d been doing it since around the second blood-moon, though. A lot of it was mostly for teas and their possible benefits.

But the coffee was fine. Just the same as black tea. Hell, the fact that caffeine worked the same for them as for humans was damn-near a miracle, even if they apparently grew a hell of a tolerance to it.

‘No more than one cup a day,’ he told them, and they happily obliged. It was obvious they didn’t like the taste, but after a few days, they seemed to have stomached it. Chef had started extracting sugars from gathered glow-berries and sweet-roots, which started to become a staple of tea and coffee. The settlement ran out of pre-packaged sugars a while back, and Harrison was happy to put something sweet into his diet. Besides, it was far healthier than Tracy’s chemical sweeteners.

Caffeination was a fine addition to the Sharkrins’ growing amenities, and even better, it was such an easy thing to produce and distribute. He mused what kind of tea leaves the new hydroponics dome could grow on the side. Tracy mentioned that her old man used to brew peppermint tea once. She’d appreciate the notion.

…When the hydroponics dome had completed construction. The area hadn’t even been cleared out yet.

The engineer definitely had his work cut out for him today, so lounging around the mess hall wasn’t a choice. Shar forced him to stand back as she grabbed hot fish cuts and glowberry porridge for him. She also tried to put more food and coffee onto him, assuming he needed a little more of everything to settle his anxiousness. The big girl wasn’t wrong per se, but she was a bit more overbearing than usual. Still, he had to make his way back to work.

And to those projects…

\= = = = =

Akula felt a frown curl over her snout, even through the pleasant heat of the fortress’ main yard.

‘A bit busy, sorry,’ was Harrison’s terse response to her request. All she wanted was to complete their conversation from the other night and converse with Priest Monbishoppe, hoping to find *real* answers to the questions that plagued her.

But, she needed both of the males to be there to get them, yet not all could agree on an ideal time—typical of the fairer sex, truly… Not that she blamed her patriarch for having his claws full.

She continued on her route to the priest’s office in the white-collar-focused first floor of the original domicile. If anything, it was only a formality to tell him that they must meet another time. The cool-tempered male would understand, given the swell in the civil and imprisoned population.

Both of their schedules had been cleared out for this block, but in respectful consideration, neither of their plans had included a near doubling of Malkrin within the humble space between these grand walls. She was sure the Creator was considering an expansion, if not a completely new ring of fortifications around the current emplacements. Space was running out too fast for the next post-blood-moon arrivals.

Indeed, there were many groups of new ones roaming about. A lot of the banished had yet to be fully processed by the script-keeper and Crosshairs, the shop-keeper. The lot of them were being informed of basic operations within the settlement alongside the Creator’s ‘Dos and Don’ts’ before their positions were fully determined.

Akula already knew that the majority of this afternoon would be spent directing the split between harvesting and teaching—outside assisting her Chef in rationing. If there was any time to need food, lumber, and minerals, it was *now*. But, the new arrivals were unlearned and posed a significant time investment.

They needed to know themselves and their place, their equipment and its use, and, above all, how to use a firearm and be entrusted with its power. No female left the settlement without one. It would be a fool’s errand to send anyone out foraging or mining without a means to defend.

Akula understood the task well. She had become familiar with her squad as well as the others. It was her decision who left and who stayed to teach the freshly banished. She knew their skills and had already planned accordingly. All that was left was to have her ideas written down and cross-referenced with the script-keeper to fill out the new block schedules in their entirety.

There was certainly going to be an increase in work hours no matter the division of labor. The next week was guaranteed to be tiresome for all, but the Creator’s vision was far grander in scale than one’s individual labor.

It was the effort she put in today that assured the success of tomorrow.

\= = = = =

Chef jogged down the line of kitchen machines, coming to a skidding halt by the mashing machine. He drew in a deep breath and lifted the exceptionally hefty pot of peeled and boiled potatoes up and into the basin.

His weary upper arms fell limp the moment he felt it was empty, but his work was not done. The cook checked the mechanism and set the settings of the masher to the correct specifications before turning it on.

The pink-skinned male glanced at his wrist watch and nodded; there were three minutes to busy himself elsewhere.

Chef returned to the star-sent cookbook—one intended for water-bound soldiers—and flipped to the page with the paper sticking out. He traced his talon along the lines of foreign script. A lot of the words were familiar, save for some of the names. Thankfully, everything necessary was rewritten in Malkrin script. A few ingredients were crossed out and substituted with black penmarking, born from his, the Creator’s, and the shopkeeper’s investigations of the recipes.

*‘Fish Balls’*

*‘100^(Malkrin Female) Portions, ~~2 3-ounce balls~~ 4 ⅓ kg balls.’*

*‘Potatoes, mashed… ~~20 pounds~~ 40kg.’*

*’ ~~codfish, canned~~ Wet fish (any kind), cleaned and pre-steamed… ~~10 pounds~~ 20kg.’*

*‘~~butter or other fat, melted~~ Hyena boar lard or edible biofuel residue, melted… ~~10 ounces~~ 1kg.’*

*‘~~eggs, slightly beaten… 2 pounds~~. Pumpkin, cleaned kelp, and blue-root purée for binder^(vitamin servings per Creator’s orders)… 4 kg.’*

*‘Mix together potatoes, fish, fat, and eggs. Salt to taste. Form balls or cakes using a ~~No. 20 ice cream scoop~~ 250 ml. ladle. Fry in fat at 375 F (190 C) for 2 minutes, or until golden-brown. Note 1.) Fish may be rolled in bread crumbs, cracker-meal, cornmeal, or flour before frying. Note 2.) Amount of salt varies with salt in potatoes or fish. (We don’t use salted fish or pre-prepared potatoes, so ignore second note.)’*

Chef hummed along to a calm southern Martian tune while he read, swaying his tail to the beat. He loved the heat of the ovens and the taste of the meals. The strain was always a part of cooking, and especially with the occasional help from others, he was happy to labor for his settlement—Akula even said the exercise helped with his figure!

The pink-skinned male’s confidence blossomed at the reminder of his soon-to-be-mate’s compliments, putting a pep in his step as he scrambled back to the dry pantry. He climbed a half-set ladder and pulled out the canned purée on one of the higher shelves. The same mix had been made many times before, but he may have to rely on a different vegetable binder if the gatherers fail to find more blue-root soon. Only the Mountain Lord knew if there would be adequate substitutes for the same vitamin servings… As if such would matter going forward.

Hyena-boar meat would be the first to be rationed, then the lard, and then fish— That is, until the fisherwomen are back to full harvests again. He only planned on using a fourth of the actual fat for any upcoming recipes, substituting the rest with edible residue.

Similarly, baked items had already been put on ration for some time, as the hydroponics domes could not grow enough grains in such a readily-available manner as compared to other root vegetables. Potato flour for bread was not so much of a replacement as it was an entirely new meal, in the cook’s *professional* opinion—n-not that he would complain to the Creator directly of course.

But, if anything, this was nothing compared to relying on merchants for goods. Inconsistent stock and varying prices of spices and salted meats made some meals more of a ‘celebratory’ occasion rather than a weekly anticipation. At least as a Sharkrin, salt—oh, glorious salt—was a guarantee!

Alas, the simpler a recipe, the better it is for the health of the pantry. Chef had been advised to use whatever was in the highest stock or to go bad soon, presumably leading to much more original stews. He was almost assured to deliver a potato bread soon, what with the wealth of potatoes swarming his stores… Perhaps a topping of sweetened vegetable and berry purée would be apt for breakfast? A fish stew was certain for dinner as well… Lots and lots of fish stew.

And fish in general, as one would presume. Chef made his way to the sink, where he had already thawed twenty kilograms of the festival’s pre-gutted and steamed catch. The pile of water-borne meats was rather moist once the ice particles melted. He took the piles of fish and minced them up until they were in chunks.

The potatoes were well mashed by then, requiring him to pull the remaining basin out of place. It was only half the needed amount, but it was awfully heavy. He took in a deep breath and tightened his muscles.

The cook yanked the massive bowl out of place and into his chest. His grip did not falter, nor did his strength… and it was suddenly light.

His heart skipped a beat the moment he saw the black-tipped, dark green-skinned hand. He glanced up toward his beloved, towering Akula, who so easily lifted the weight up and out of his arms.

*“Had I not requested that you leave such terrible burdens to myself?”* she questioned with a flirtatious grin, her sharp, endearing eyes making his knees weak. *“Where does this dish belong?”*

*“T-The counter by the sink,”* Chef sputtered, taking a few heavy breaths to regain himself. He jogged behind her to where this night’s meal was being prepared.

His dear temptress, wearing her enticing, form-fitting skin-suit, crouched down by the sink. She needed to be practically sitting so that she could place the lukewarm basin of potatoes on the stone table. She looked at him with warmth in her eyes. *“Is this acceptable, my male?”*

H…Her male… He could not put down the smile creeping up his lip. *“O-Of-course! You have my thanks for your endless generosity!”*

Her tail naturally found its way around his, effortlessly pulling him a little closer into her assertive presence. His brain had almost ceased all higher functions, but a nasty reminder had managed to wiggle into his joy.

He took one of her giant palms and began to knead the stress out of it as he spoke. *“Dearest Akula… were you not meant to be busy this afternoon? It was to my understanding that you had much to do in directing the Sharkrin squads’ next steps.”*

_“Yes, that **is** correct. However, I had much of my decisions planned and the Creator readily agreed with them, making such work less of a time requirement.”_ She squinted at him, resting her hands on his sides in a way that sent lightning up his veins. *“What was even more pressing is that my dear Chef is all alone in the kitchen, cooking for over a hundred bellies. All the other males are too preoccupied to lessen your burden.”*

*Her* male shook his head, softly nuzzling his cheek into her open palm. *“It is my destined labor to ensure none of the Sharkrin go hungry. What is fifty more mouths to feed when I am sworn to such duties? I enjoy the heat of these stoves and the gratefulness of our brothers and sisters of the settlement.”*

Akula took one of his hands between her thumb and foremost talon, showcasing the toughened skin of his palm. *“And yet your hands have lost their soft embrace; the strain of the knife has taken part of your gods-gifted masculinity… There are other males who know how to cook. The Creator and the script-keeper agreed one cook should not take the burden of feeding so many all by his lonesome—even if I am to assist from time to time.”*

The cooks subtly winced at the reference to his lost masculinity. Perhaps it was more true than he or his soon-to-be-mate would like. Males should be strong in their labor, but not at the cost of a demure and prim exterior… However, despite how well he wished to suit his dear and whomever his second mate was, he did have a purpose to fulfil and standards he abided by.

*“But that does not mean any other male would be able to supplant the goals we share,”* he stated, staring long into her glowing eyes. *“Would any home cook be so stringent on the taste of meals as I have? When we cook together, my sweet?”*

Continuing, Chef averted his gaze for a moment and frowned. *“I understand I should not wear myself so harshly. It would reflect poorly upon our mated union, I know. But I do take pride in my labor. You are aware of this more than any other, so before I am hampered by others in our kitchen, I have a request; I would like to be in a position that governs food decisions.”*

The overseer scoffed, giving him an incredulous expression. *“Such was already assured! You are exceptional in the culinary arts, even above other males. The Creator had intended to make you your own squad, or at least in league with the farmers. My own fisherwomen and gatherers are soon to swell in ranks as is. A restructuring of leadership is guaranteed!”*

He froze. His own squad? His curled lips grinned wider; he really liked the sound of that. *“O-Oh! I see! I was so worried I would have been diluted in our own kitchen!”*

*“Nonsense. Your position is cherished amongst all Sharkrin. The Creator is no fool, and even if he decided to ‘dilute’ your skills, I would make sure he questioned his own decision,”* Akula charmed, crouching lower to nuzzle his snout.

*“Now,”* she continued. *“Shall we finish this meal whilst we have time together?”*

*“I could think of no better way to spend my afternoon,”* he answered kindly, letting her tail squeeze further around his.

And he was correct in that assumption. Akula was a blessing in the kitchen with her strength and height, making all the heaviest of pots seem like mere paperweights. The main mixing and cooking of the potato-fish balls went without difficulty, not to mention how useful it was to have two more pairs of hands to tend to other ongoing processes.

Her tail would often get in the way of the kitchen’s restrictive area. It would sway too widely or merely cut him off with its length… and length it had. Chef was not completely certain, but her fins had elongated, sharpening to a further point than he recalled. Perhaps they were thicker at the base, too? Her figure was… *alluring* to begin with, either way.

In the meantime, the two of them managed to assemble another cold dish of leafy vegetables and sour dressing in the time they had together. Extra sauces and distillation of heavy sugars went so fast with her company, so the two of them had some time to expend.

Without nothing immediate to do, Akula humored him to dance like Shar’khee and Harrison once did. 

His dearest mate led him to an open portion of the half-lit mess hall as the quiet music began to play. She oh-so tenderly gripped his hands and brought him close.

It was an awkward few moments as they figured out how to hold one another *and* move side to side so gracefully. No matter the struggle, she was most gentle in the way she led his body to and fro. They chittered together when their tails got in the way, and they shared warm gazes when they found a rhythm.

It was hard to look anywhere else but at her. So strong, so *direct*, yet so affectionate. The way her palms slid up his arms and to his shoulders sent shivers down his spine. It did not matter if he stumbled or if her height stretched his arms too far sometimes; he was delighted in every sense of the word

Together, throughout the afternoon, they learned how to spin in circles as one in between tasks.

Later, his Akula regaled tales of the sea kingdom while they delivered potato peels and unused food scraps to the growing pen of hyena-boars. Similarly, he told of the odd things Artificer Tracy and Rei described during lance training for their mechs. Things such as starships and ‘faster-than-light drives’ sparked her curiosity in a way he could not describe.

Their conversations seemed incapable of ending between their mutual infatuation with one another. It almost broke his heart to hear both of their watches beep in sync with the church’s great bell.

Such a splendid time was not made to be forever. He helped to wash the few stains off his dearest’s skin-suit, daring so much as to leave a lick upon her snout when he asked her to kneel down before she left.

She could not hide her flush, but the sensation seemed to strike something within her. The overseer looked at him with a subtle curiosity. *“Before I depart, I have a singular request of you.”*

*“Oh? And what might that entail?”* he asked gleefully, his heart pounding from his playful showing of affection.

*“I would like for you to speak with the lead farmer more, the one with reflective, black skin… I have seen and heard great things from her.”*

*“Are you directing me to attract her attention? I… I thought you wished for us to speak with one from your House? Mitsan, you said her name was.”*

Akula smiled softly, revealing a deeper hope behind her eyes. *“I still do. However, if we are to accelerate our union so swiftly, it would be wrong for us to be so few. If I am to bare pups, there must be another for our love… If you do not find the farmer right for you, there are many other admirable females that we can find.”*

The cook accepted her tail wrapping around him with a squeezing embrace. *“Of course. You are always so thoughtful. I will speak with her soon.”*

*“Then you have my thanks.”* His beautiful overseer pushed her snout in between his frills and drew her tongue across his head.

She departed soon after, leaving a hole in him where her company once resided… Mountain Lord, when was the last time he thought about having pups? Of starting a family and finding mates? Lord of the Mountain, everything was so natural, so *smooth*.

He never expected the mainland to be the best place to truly start his life.

1q3rw02,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q3rw02/my_25f_boyfriend_28m_is_great_but_seems_to_want/,My (25F) boyfriend (28M) is great but seems to want me to act as his maid. Is this something we can work through?,"My boyfriend is from a completely different culture and background than me, and he’s from a very religious and traditional family. We are in a long distance relationship for 6 months and have been together physically for about 2 months of that time. He’s basically used to seeing the women in his family caring for the children, cooking, cleaning and doing everything in the house. He’s great in so many ways. He shows up for me and is very sweet, generous, and committed to me since we met. He is so much of what I want.

However when we lived together for the first time for a few weeks he told me he wants me to cook for him (since he never learned to cook or do household chores) and it’s like he expected me to cook for him everyday. I’m good at cooking and it’s something I genuinely enjoy, it’s a love language for me, but this feeling of him expecting me to do it really started to bother me. He also started asking me often to bring him coffee, tea and snacks. He was pretty rude to me one time when he told me the dish I made was better the way I made it the first time, when I confronted him about this he said it’s because I told him to be honest about my food. I did tell him that, but the way he said it felt very inconsiderate. I feel like most people would understand that. One time he also asked me to put more cheese on the pasta I made, I don’t understand why he couldn’t just go to the fridge and do it himself? He asked me a few times ”what will you cook for me tonight” like it was expected of me. Basically this whole situation started to bother me. It was too much, I started feeling like his maid at times. It’s like he didn’t understand how rude he was being about this. I did test him a few times by for example asking him to do the dishes after I cooked, and to bring me tea a few times, and he did, which gave me hope.

It’s like me cooking for him seemed so important to him. He also complimented my cooking constantly and told me it’s the best food he’s had. Overall it just became a weird situation around this. It worries me, because If I will live with him in the future I will never accept acting as a maid and doing everything in the house. He never told me he expects this, but with his behaviour I feel like that’s what he wants. I love to cook for him and I am good at it, and I’m happy to do more of the cooking in the future if we live together but I never want to feel forced to do it or feel like his maid.

I understand his side because that’s how he grew up. I don’t know how to bring this up to him, especially since we are long distance right now and I feel like bringing it up over a phone call can easily result in us misunderstanding each other. We will see each other again in a month so I’m thinking about bringing this up then, in person.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

I’m a 21 year old guy who recently moved to Berlin, and I’m looking to meet some cool people and build a social circle here. My background is a bit of a mix: I’m originally from Turkey, but I lived in Mozambique for 8 years before coming here.

 I'm fluent in Turkish, English, and Portuguese. I am currently learning German (the struggle is real, but I'm getting there!).

 I’m a regular at the gym and love going for long walks to explore different parts of the city.

I’m a big fan of Formula 1 (Piastri fan), video games, and cooking.

I actually love to crochet (it's my favorite way to relax), and I'm a huge history buff. I’m also currently studying Psychology, so I’m always down for deep conversations.

Just a heads up, I don’t drink and I’m not into the party or clubbing scene. Berlin is famous for its nightlife, but I much prefer a chill afternoon at a cafe, a gym session, a museum visit, or a gaming night. If you’re also looking for ""sober fun"" or just prefer a more laid back lifestyle, we’ll probably get along great.

What I’m looking for:
Someone to grab a coffee/tea with, a gym buddy, someone to watch F1 with, or just a friend to explore Berlin’s history and museums.

I used to be very baffled with how people used to make me choose between tea and coffee. It felt like choosing between my two favourite songs naina morey by Somlata Acharya Chowdhry and Daira from City sessions Volume 2. But sometimes I often used to think that why can't I have two favourite things and why is this world so obsessed with black and white. I know the world will call me a diplomat.

Today when I was sipping tea in a new tea shop near my place, I realised how coffee used to taste on my tongue. It tasted like those sophisticated coffee dates with him, ""I have to complete this work before my manager kills me” nights, flat white latte on solo dates with colours in my tote bag, difficult confessions that him and I made and the new girl in the city like Bangalore drinking coffee before she leaves for work.

But you know how tea used to make me feel, the rusk and tea in the evening with my mother, getting drenched in the rain with my best friend and then drinking tea, making my father taste my best tea but he never liked, having the tea and bunmaska alone in Pune.

This new year choosing tea over coffee felt like choosing myself over  people, choosing happiness over hustle, peace over instant dopamine, choosing love over anxiety. When I was making a vision board like every year it felt something different because I am someone who takes my life so seriously that one mistake or one hurdle makes me feel it’s the end of my life. 

I am going to complete 2 years in Bangalore, it made me realise how life feels without surviving. It gave me a taste of how life feels whether it was dancing in the club or a bunch of people appreciating my work by giving a round of applause. It felt like a hot cup of filter coffee which took me on a rollercoaster ride of life and some days it helped me over a cup of tea with my friend crying about my “why me” moments.

This new year is so special to me in so many ways that I know how I want to live my life  and the answer to that question.",21,1767538020.0,BangaloreSocial,34,0.89,False

1q3rmrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1q3rmrs/a_vivid_wild_experience_from_paralysis_to_flying/,A vivid WILD experience: from paralysis to flying and lucid dreaming.,"I woke up at 4:00 a.m. I usually start my day around 4:30, but since it was the weekend and there was no rush, I decided to attempt WILD. This was my second try.

I chose WILD partly because I was getting fed up with not having spontaneous lucid dreams. I often notice repetitive dream symbols, and during the day I keep telling myself that I should know I’m dreaming when these appear. Despite that, spontaneous LDs hadn’t happened yet, so I decided to work more directly with awareness.

I also told myself that even if WILD didn’t fully work, it would still be a good meditation.

As my body relaxed, I noticed the usual distractions: itching, mild pain, and strange bodily sensations. It felt like my mind was playing tricks on me, including false sensations suggesting that my limbs were in a different position than before, clearly trying to make me move. It felt like my mind was trying to pull my attention away. I focused on my breath and repeated silently:

“Lucid dream. I am a lucid dream.”

Whenever thoughts appeared, I returned to the phrase.

I’m not sure exactly when sleep began, but imagery formed. I found myself in a warehouse unpacking large boxes of coffee cups. Then the scene shifted to a shop with my ex-husband. I was wearing a black lace dress and red shoes. We were choosing shoes, and I sat down on a bench to try them on. He started dancing provocatively, and I felt uncomfortable and disengaged from the scene.

I lay back on a chair and thought clearly: I want to be back in my bed now.!!! I felt a strong surge of energy, and suddenly I was back in my bed.

At that point, I was very aware that my body was asleep. I could feel my eyes moving rapidly. I saw darkness mixed with faint light patterns, but I remained calm and observant. Then I felt a force lifting me up. I floated out of my bed, passed through the wall, rotated, and moved back through my bedroom and bathroom. I remember thinking: This feels like a test—am I afraid, or do I accept what’s happening?

Next, I shot out of the house into a clear, starry night. I could feel the rush of air around me, the pressure and speed of movement, and the momentum of flying — everything felt incredibly vivid and realistic. Stars seemed to fall toward me, appearing as numbers.

To test lucidity, I looked at my hand—it was huge. I tried a nose-breathing reality check, but it was difficult due to the paralysis-like sensation. I brought my hand to my mouth and shouted, “I am not asleep!” The scene briefly darkened, then stabilized again. I told myself, “Not yet,” and continued flying, feeling excited and fully aware.

I wondered what to do next. I felt an impulse to visit a specific person, but decided I wasn’t ready and let it go. I heard music in the background, and soon after, the visuals began to fade. Everything turned black again. I tried spinning to stabilize the scene, but couldn’t move due to the paralysis sensation. Eventually, awareness returned fully to my physical body in bed.

What surprised me most is that after successfully performing WILD, my first spontaneous lucid dream occurred later, without using a direct technique. It felt as if WILD “taught” my mind the state, making spontaneous lucidity finally possible. ",2,1767537845.0,LucidDreaming,1,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're hustling 24/7 but your bank account isn’t reflecting the grind? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. If you’re not leveraging AI in 2026, you’re leaving money on the table. Here are **3 actionable ways** to turn AI into your silent money-making partner. Let’s go! 🚀

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The Set-It-And-Forget-It Goldmine)**
Remember when blogging meant slaving over a keyboard for hours? **Not anymore.** With AI tools like *Jasper* or *SurferSEO*, you can:
- **Find untapped niches** (think “eco-friendly pet toys for senior dogs”).
- **Auto-generate SEO-optimized posts** in minutes.
- **Monetize with ads/affiliates** (AdSense, Amazon Associates, etc.).

**Pro tip:** Use AI to schedule posts for months in advance. Wake up to passive ad revenue while you sip coffee. ☕ *Cha-ching.*

---

### **2. AI-Powered YouTube Shorts/TikTok Clips (Viral Content on Autopilot)**
Short-form video isn’t slowing down—it’s *exploding*. AI tools like *Pictory* or *Synthesia* let you:
- **Turn blog posts into engaging videos** (no editing skills needed).
- **Auto-generate captions/voiceovers** in multiple languages.
- **Repurpose old content** into fresh, trending clips.

**Example:** I took a 2-year-old blog post, fed it to AI, and turned it into 5 TikTok clips. One went viral (100K+ views) and drove affiliate sales. **Zero extra work.**

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The Sleeping Giant of Passive Income)**
Newsletters are back, baby—and AI makes them *effortless*. Tools like *Beehiiv* or *ConvertKit* + AI can:
- **Auto-summarize trending topics** in your niche.
- **Personalize content** for subscribers (higher engagement = more $$).
- **Monetize with sponsorships** (brands pay $500–$5K per send).

**Real talk:** I launched a “AI Tools Weekly” newsletter in 30 mins. Now it earns $1.2K/month from ads. **All automated.**

---

**Final thought:** AI isn’t just a tool—it’s your *passive income partner*. Start small, scale fast, and watch the cash flow in while you sleep. 💰

*(P.S. If you’re curious about other passive income hacks, I recently found a community focusing on automated reselling that guarantees 10x ROI. I’m testing their daily secret deal alerts—here’s my affiliate link if you wanna check it out: [https://clipwise.ai/?utm_source=affiliate&linkId=lp_603470&sourceId=liveitup-deals&tenantId=clipwise&affS1=reddit])*

In your writing, the most beautiful sight is the console streaming in emerald green, confirming that the system is stable and the ""zero-cost ideal"" is functioning perfectly. Today, aim for that same ""emerald"" state. Let your thoughts flow with zero resistance, your actions be purposeful, and your energy be spent on building, not just maintaining.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

“When Britney Spears split up with Justin Timberlake earlier this year, she headed straight to another man - Hollywood's top alternative medic, Dr Steven Small. \`I was the one who recommended she take off six months from work - she needed a complete break,' he reveals.  
  
He also prescribed a range of homeopathic and herbal remedies, as well as dishing out practical advice. \`Britney had a lot of emotional stress,' Dr Small says, at his office in Marina del Rey, Los Angeles. \`But that just added to everything else she was dealing with - all the travelling, working too hard and banging out shows every night. When she came to me she was burnt out, exhausted. \`When we first met I was surprised that she's kind of shy - you imagine her to be outgoing, but she's not. She didn't start chatting right away. She's pretty sensitive and very vulnerable. It's clear fame, money and power haven't gone to her head. In fact, she was impressed with the other stars I see. She asked me about some of my well-known patients and was so excited when I mentioned their names. I really don't think she realises how big a star she is. I was also surprised at how pretty she was in real life with no make-up on - she was radiant and has a lovely smile.'  
  
Despite speculation about Britney, Dr Small says, \`Her body fat is right on target - she isn't overweight at all, not even by an ounce. She's in great shape. Of course she does rigorous workouts every day - she has to for her two-hour performances and dance routines.  
  
\`We didn't focus on weight, it was more about dealing with the fatigue. \`She drinks coffee in the morning and I told her to make sure she keeps her caffeine to a minimum because it would make her more tired. I also recommended it would be better for her to discontinue smoking. She needed time off to regenerate, even though she's young. When she said she was tired I don't think anyone took her seriously, so she was relieved when I confirmed she needed to stop.'”",5,1767537336.0,discussingbritney,4,1.0,False

I use 10g coffee with 150g water at 96c. I bloom the coffee for a couple seconds, using between 30 and 50g of water. Then I generally add the rest of the water in two more pours, swirl and then sit until all the water has gone trough.

I've been really struggling to get good results with my V60, noticing that my aeropress coffee has much more flavour every time. Because most recipes use so much more water, I can't really easily follow them. For example, just blooming the coffee can take up between 30 and 50g of my water, nearly a third of the total!

Any advice how to adapt existing recipes for my smaller brew size, or links to recipes foe smaller cups?

So here comes the ever present and cliched new Year's Resolution of mine- healthier eating and exercise habits, and ultimately loose weight with this healthier lifestyle. *sigh*. 🫡

Most of the products we see on the shelves in grocery stores are usually filled with so much unhealthy stuff, and the advertising of said products like ""healthy cereals"" etc are quite tricky and smart with their wording so one really has to take note of the ingredient listings in order to catch them out...but seriously, who has time to read every ingredient on every product when one goes shopping? My dad already grumps and moans that I spend too long grocery shopping when I do my browsing for specials and sales.
😂🤡

Do y'all have any product recommendations that are budget friendly? I'm talking about alternatives and recipes or just products in general that have little to no harmful/unhealthy ingredients in that may affect ones weight and overall health. 

I'm really looking for things that are either have one or in some combination of, high proteins, high minerals and vitamins, and with benefits for the body that focus on organ healing and weight loss/management.

I'm on medication, as well, for the past few years with side effects that result in increased hunger and food noise (this has really impacted how I view food and it has impacted both my mental and physical health 🥲)...it has definitely resulted in lots of weight gain which I only put the dots together recently, so I'm wanting to help combat this.

Please list your favourite:

Products
Alternatives to ""unhealthier"" products (especially for oil- I airfry and can steam some foods, but I'm not sure what I can use as a healthier option for cooking in the oven or pan)
Recipes
Drinks (teas or coffees or sugar free examples etc)
Snack options (rice/carrot etc cakes? Are these even healthy alternatives? I hear various things...)
Tips and tricks when cooking or food prepping

I cook for the household and my dad is also a little fussy so I'm hoping I can find some good suggestions here! 😂🤗

Have a great day further and thanks in advance!

I'm considered high risk due to familial cancer history including a sibling who passed in June 25 from Stage 4 CRC. So yeah I was looking forward to checking this box to know for sure. All good in the hood but I was pretty disappointed with the lack of education the facility and Dr offered about how to eat before prep, managing your body's reactions to prep and the post-procedure guidance.

After my procedure the dr said no concerns, clear colon, see you in five years. Awesome. He then said ""go home, rest, eat whatever you want"" which seemed like a dumb thing to say. My entire gut biome was just wiped out and he had no idea what my diet was like before. 4 days later and i still hadn't had a bowel movement so you can bet your asses I used Dr AI to do some research. Here's what i learned - hope this helps.

50% of patients don't have a BM until 4-6 days after. Continue to avoid the things you were told not to eat the day before like nuts, seeds, popcorn, quinoa. This is also where, if you switched to a ""low residue diet"" for pre-prep (white everything - bread, rice, potatoes, poached chicken, etc), you should switch back and slowly reintroduce fiber and 5x your normal hydration routine. I'm regular as can be and thought my normal routine would be enough. I was still experiencing symptoms of dehydration 4 days later.

Do your research folks - whole grains and fiber are great but certain kinds of veg and grains will actually contribute to dehydration, drawing water out of the foods you eat when you need it to get to the colon the most.

Poop induction meal that worked for me on Day 5:

Day 4 Dinner - steamed broccoli and ground turkey with tikka masala sauce (warming spices help relax your colon)

Day 5 -

24 oz water on waking

Breakfast (more like dessert but I didn't even need to finish it) - 5 prunes, 2T water, 1 t black strap molasses (microwave 90s), stir in a little coconut oil or more water to thin it, add 5-10 dark chocolate chips and stir to melt, top with plain yogurt.

# I. The Accumulation of Dust

I did not leave the city because I hated it. Hate implies a kind of passion I simply didn’t possess anymore. I left because I was tired of the noise. Not the traffic, or the construction drills, or the sirens that bled through the single-pane windows of my apartment on 4th Street. It was the internal noise. The constant, grinding friction of maintaining a life that felt increasingly like a performance for an empty theater.

I was forty-one years old. I worked in logistics for a mid-sized shipping firm. My job was to ensure that pallets of plastic components moved from a warehouse in Ohio to a distribution center in Kentucky. I was good at it. I could look at a spreadsheet and see where the bottlenecks were, where the fuel was being wasted, where the human error was accumulating like silt in a drain. I had a talent for spotting the weak point in a system.

The problem was that eventually, I turned that gaze on myself.

I realized, over a period of months, that I was the weak point. I was the friction. I sat in meetings and nodded at old men in old suits, and I felt a physical sickness, a tightness in my chest that I initially mistook for angina. My doctor told me it was stress. He prescribed me pills that made my mouth dry and my thoughts slow. He told me to exercise. I tried. I ran on a treadmill in a gym, watching CNN on a mute television. I watched disasters unfold in silence. Floods. Fires. Elections. It all looked the same. It all looked like entropy.

I didn't have a breakdown. There was no screaming match, no throwing of chairs. One Friday, I simply didn't go to work. I sat in my kitchen and watched the sunlight move across the linoleum. It took four hours to cross the room. I timed it. It was the most honest thing I had witnessed in years. I spent the next month divesting. I broke my lease. I sold my car. I donated my suits to a shelter. I bought a backpack, a sleeping bag rated for zero degrees, and enough freeze-dried food to last three months. I bought maps. Topographical maps of the  Appalachian woodlands, areas where the contour lines were tight and tangled, indicating steep terrain and no roads.

I didn't tell my parents. They were dead, which made things easier. I didn't tell my friends, because I realized that I didn't actually have any. I had colleagues. I had acquaintances. I had people I drank beer with and complained about sports teams with. But I didn't have anyone who would feel a phantom limb if I were amputated from their life.

I was manageable. I was removable.

When I locked the door to the apartment for the last time, I dropped the keys through the mail slot. I heard them hit the floor on the other side. A metallic *clink*. That was it. The sound of a life ending.

*Ecclesiastes 12:3-5 (KJV)*

*In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low... Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way... because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.*

# II. The Green Static

The woods were not majestic. That was the first disappointment, though I suppose I had anticipated it. The woods were wet and indifferent.

I parked the rental car at a trailhead that hadn't been maintained in a decade, threw the keys into the undergrowth, and walked. I walked until the trail disappeared into a tangle of briars and rhododendrons, and then I kept walking. My plan was simple. Exist. I wanted to reduce the variables of my life to the absolute minimum. Shelter. Water. Heat. I wanted to see if the noise would stop if I took away the signal.

For the first two weeks, it was just work. Hard, stupid work. I set up my tent in a clearing near a stream that tasted of iron. I gathered wood. I dug a latrine. My hands blistered, then bled, then calloused. My back ached with a dull, throbbing consistency that became my new baseline for reality.

I had expected some kind of spiritual awakening. I had read the books. I expected the silence to cleanse me. Instead, the silence amplified the triviality of my own mind.

I caught myself thinking about the shipping manifests. I would be trying to start a fire with damp kindling, and my brain would be calculating the cubic footage of the woodpile. I would be filtering water, and I would find myself humming a jingle for a car insurance company I hadn't seen a commercial for in five years.

The modern world is not a place you leave; it is a parasite you carry.

""Shut up-"" I said to the trees.

The trees did not answer. They dripped. It rained for four days straight. Everything I owned became damp. The smell of mildew settled into my pores. I started talking to myself. Not in a crazy way, I told myself. Just narration. Just keeping track.

""Okay…"" I’d say, pulling on wet boots. ""Boots on. Coffee. Then wood.""

It was a way of imposing order. I was still a logistics manager. I was just managing a warehouse of one. But as the weeks stretched into a month, the edges began to blur. The hunger started. I was rationing the food carefully, but I was burning more calories than I was consuming. I lost weight. My belt ran out of holes, so I punched a new one with the awl on my multitool.

I began to see patterns that weren't there.

It started with the roots. I was walking along a ridge, looking for dry pine, and I saw a root structure that looked exactly like a circuit board. I stopped and stared at it. The way the smaller rootlets branched off the main artery... It was perfect logic. It was a schematic.

""It's just a root-"" I said. My voice sounded thin, like wind through dry grass.

""It's efficient!"" I corrected myself.

Later that night, the stream sounded like voices. Not distinct words, just the murmur of a cocktail party in the next room. Low laughter. The clinking of glass. I knew it was the water hitting the rocks. I knew that auditory pareidolia was a common symptom of isolation. I was intelligent. I knew the names of things.

But I still sat up in my sleeping bag, straining to hear if they were talking about me.

*Athanasius of Alexandria, 'Life of St. Anthony' (c. 360 AD)*

*And in the night they made such a crashing noise that the whole place seemed to be shaken by an earthquake. It was as though demons were breaking through the four walls of the little chamber and bursting through them in droves... Anthony, however, was not disturbed... He said, ""If you had any power, it would have been enough for just one of you to come; but the Lord has broken your strength, so you try to frighten me by your number.""*

# III. The Architecture of Rot

The change happened in the second month. The autumn was bleeding into winter. The leaves had turned into a brown sludge on the forest floor, and the air had a bite that made my lungs ache. I had moved further north, deeper into the valley system, following the water. I told myself I was looking for better shelter, perhaps a cave or an overhang. In reality, I think I was running away from the cocktail party in the stream.

I found the fence line on a Tuesday. I had lost track of the days, but I decided it was Tuesday because Tuesday was a nothing day.

The fence was old chain-link, rusted to the color of dried blood. It emerged from a dense thicket of spruce and ran in a straight, geometric line up the side of the mountain. It shouldn't have been there. There were no roads, no trails, no logging camps on the map. I touched the metal. It flaked away under my thumb, staining my skin orange.

""Hello."" I whispered.

I followed the fence. It was comforting. It was a straight line in a world of fractals. It led me for three miles, up and over a ridge, and down into a bowl-shaped valley that the sun seemed to have forgotten.

In the center of the valley stood the structures.

They were concrete, low and brutalist, stained with moss and lichen. There were four of them, arranged in a semicircle around a central plaza of cracked asphalt. They looked like bunkers, or perhaps utility stations for a grid that had long since gone dark.

I stopped at the edge of the trees. My heart was hammering against my ribs, a frantic, bird-like rhythm.

This was it. This was the anomaly.

I should have turned back. The rational part of my brain, the part that knew about trespassing and safety, screamed at me to leave. But I was cold. I was so incredibly cold. And the concrete looked solid. It looked like geometry. It looked like home. I walked across the asphalt. The silence here was different. It wasn't the organic silence of the woods; it was a dead silence. The silence of a stopped machine.

The door to the central building was steel. It was unlocked. It swung open with a shriek of rusted hinges that sounded like a woman screaming.

Inside, it was dry. That was the first miracle. The air was stale, smelling of dust and ozone, but it was dry.

I used my flashlight. The beam cut through the gloom, revealing a long hallway lined with doors. It looked like a school, or a hospital, or a prison. The paint was peeling in long, translucent strips, hanging from the ceiling like dead skin.

I found a room that looked like an office. There was a metal desk, a chair, and a filing cabinet. No papers. No computer. Just the furniture, heavy and permanent.

I sat in the chair. It swiveled.

I laughed. A dry, hacking sound. I spun around in the chair, once, twice.

""I am the manager-!"" I said to the empty room.

I decided to stay. Just for the night, I told myself. Just to get dry.

But when I woke up the next morning, the light coming through the dirty, high windows was wrong. It was too gray. And when I looked at my watch, it had stopped.

Not just stopped. The hands were gone. They had fallen off the spindle and lay at the bottom of the dial, two little sticks of metal resting in the dark. I walked out into the hallway. And that’s when I smelled the coffee.

*'The Ruin', Old English Poem (8th Century, Exeter Book)*

*This masonry is wondrous; fates broke it / The courtyard pavements were smashed; the work of giants is decaying / Roofs are fallen, ruinous towers / The frosty gate with frost on mortar / Shattered are the shower-shields, parted from the roofs / The age has devoured them...*

# IV. The Neighbors

I followed the smell. It was rich, dark, and impossible.

It led me out of the main building and toward one of the smaller structures on the periphery. As I approached, I saw the smoke. A thin, blue wisp rising from a stovepipe I hadn't noticed the day before.

I stopped. Panic, cold and sharp, flooded my gut. I wasn't alone. Squatters? Survivalists? A meth lab? My mind raced through the catalogue of urban dangers I thought I had left behind.

I hid behind a rusted generator housing and watched.

The door to the building opened. A woman stepped out. She was wearing a heavy wool sweater and jeans. She looked... Normal. She wasn't carrying a rifle. She didn't have the wild, matted hair of a hermit. She looked like she was stepping out to get the mail in a suburb of Cleveland.

She dumped a pan of water onto the asphalt. The steam hissed. Then she looked directly at the generator where I was hiding.

She didn't scream. She didn't point. She just nodded, once, as if confirming a delivery.

""Coffee's on!"" She called out. Her voice was flat, carrying easily across the distance.

I didn't move. I couldn't. My legs felt like they were filled with concrete.

""It's cold out there-"" she added. ""We have oatmeal.""

We  
**We.**  
**WE.**

I stood up. My knees popped. I felt ridiculous in my filthy tech-fabric gear, standing before this woman who looked like a librarian on her day off.

""I'm lost…"" I said. It was the first lie. I wasn't lost. I knew exactly where I was on the map. The map was just wrong.

""No-"" She said. ""You're just late.""

I followed her inside.

The interior was warm. A wood stove burned in the corner. There were rugs on the floor. Faded, oriental patterns that looked strangely out of place against the industrial concrete. There were others. A man reading a paperback book in a recliner. A younger woman sewing a patch onto a pair of trousers. A child, maybe seven years old, pushing a toy truck across the floor. They all looked up. They all nodded. There was no surprise. No hostility. Just a quiet, terrifying acceptance.

""Sit."" The woman said, handing me a mug.

It was a ceramic mug. It said *World's Best Dad* on it. The irony was so heavy I almost dropped it.

""Who are you people?"" I asked. My voice cracked. I hadn't used it for conversation in weeks.

""We live here…"" The man in the recliner said. He didn't close his book. ""We're the maintenance crew.""

""Maintenance for what?""

""For the quiet."" He said.

I drank the coffee. It was instant, and it was the best thing I had ever tasted. I wanted to run. Every alarm bell in my head was ringing. This was a trap. This was a hallucination brought on by starvation and mold spores.

But the heat from the stove was real. The weight of the mug was real.

""I can't stay."" I said.

""Of course not."" The woman said, refilling my cup before I had even finished it. ""You have to process first.""

""Process?""

""The rust-"" She said gently. She reached out and touched my hand. Her fingers were warm, dry, and rough. ""You're still shiny. You're still vibrating. You can't settle until the oxidation sets in.""

I looked at my hand. It was filthy, scratched, and shaking.

""I don't understand.""

""You don't have to."" She said. ""Understanding is just… It’s just noise. Just eat your oatmeal.""

*James 5:1-3 (KJV)*

*Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.*

# V. The Prophet

I stayed. Of course I stayed. I told myself it was to gather strength. I told myself I was studying them, like an anthropologist. But the truth was simpler. I was tired, and they had chairs. The days bled into one another. There was no sun in the valley, only a perpetual, diffuse gray light. I stopped looking for my watch.

I integrated into their routine. We chopped wood. We scavenged canned goods from a cellar that seemed impossibly well-stocked. We swept the concrete floors. There was no chanting. No prayers. No sermons. This… Group. Had no dogma other than existence. They rarely spoke. When they did, it was about practical things. The draft in the north hall. The level of the water cistern.

But there was a center. I felt it. A gravity that pulled everything toward the main building's basement.

On the seventh day, the woman, her name was Sarah, she told me, though I suspected she had chosen it arbitrarily, took me to see him.

""Is he the leader?"" I asked as we descended the stairs. The air got colder.

""He's the oldest."" She said. ""He's the furthest along.""

The basement was a vast, open space filled with pipes and machinery that hadn't moved in fifty years. In the center, sitting on a folding chair beneath a single, naked bulb, was a man. He didn't look like a prophet. He looked like an accountant who had been forgotten in a storage room. He wore a gray cardigan and slacks that were polished with wear. He was bald, his skin the color of parchment.

He was staring at a patch of rust on a support pillar.

""This is him…"" Sarah said.

The man didn't look up. ""It's beautiful, isn't it?"" he said. His voice was soft, dry, like paper rubbing together.

I looked at the rust. It was just rust. Flaking, orange, ugly.

""It's corrosion."" I said. ""It's structural damage.""

The man smiled. He finally looked at me. His eyes were milky, clouded with cataracts, but he seemed to see me clearly.

""Damage…"" He repeated. ""That's the word the shiny world uses. They think maintenance is the fight against death. They think if they paint over the rust enough times, they can live forever.""

He gestured to the empty chair beside him. I sat.

""You came here because you were tired."" He said. It wasn't a question.

""I came here to get away from the noise.""

""The noise is the effort-"" he said. ""The noise is the energy required to keep things separate. To keep the iron from the oxygen. To keep the man from the earth. It takes so much energy to be a person, doesn't it? To be a distinct, functioning unit.""

I felt a lump in my throat. He was saying what I had felt in the grocery store aisle.

""What is this place?"" I asked.

""A waiting room."" He said. ""Or perhaps a compost heap. We aren't building anything here. We aren't starting a new society. We are just... Stopping.""

He reached out and touched the rusted pillar. A flake of metal came off on his finger. He rubbed it into dust.

""The world ended a long time ago."" He said. ""The systems just haven't realized it yet. They're still spinning, still burning fuel, still making noise. But the engine is dead. We're just the ones who admitted it.""

""That's defeatist-"" I said. My defensive cynicism flared up, a weak spark. ""Humanity survives. We adapt.""

""Do we?"" He looked at my hands. ""Look at you. You ran away. You couldn't hack the adaptation. You're like a screw that stripped its threads. You can't hold anything together anymore.""

I looked at my hands. They were trembling.

""So what happens now?"" I asked.

""Nothing."" He said. ""That's the gift. Nothing happens. You sit here. You let the weather in. You let the oxidation happen. You stop fighting the gravity. You become part of the geology.""

He leaned back and closed his eyes.

""It's very peaceful…"" He whispered. ""Once you stop trying to be waterproof.""

# VI. The Oxide Layer

I tried to leave the next day.

I packed my bag. I put on my boots. I walked to the fence line.

The fence was gone.

Not removed. Gone. The forest had swallowed it. Where the chain-link had been, there was now a wall of briars and thorns so thick, so dense, that it looked like it had been growing for a century.

I walked the perimeter. It was the same everywhere. The valley was sealed.

I didn't panic. I should have, but I didn't. I felt a strange, heavy acceptance settling into my chest. It felt like sinking into a warm bath. I walked back to the buildings. Sarah was outside, hanging laundry on a line strung between two rusted I-beams.

""The fence is gone."" I said.

""Yes-"" She said. ""It wasn't needed anymore.""

""I can't get out.""

She looked at me, and for the first time, I saw the sadness in her eyes. It wasn't pity. It was the shared grief of the terminal ward. ""Why would you want to go back?"" She asked.

""Because I'm alive…?"" I said. But it sounded like a question.

""You're rusting."" She said. ""Just like the rest of us.""

I looked down at my arm. There was a patch of skin on my forearm that looked rough, reddish, flaky. Eczema, I told myself. Psoriasis from the stress and the diet.

But deep down, I knew.

I went back to the basement. The old man was still there. He hadn't moved.

I sat in the chair beside him.

""I can't leave-"" I said.

""No."" He agreed.

""Is this... are we dead?"" I asked. ""Is this hell?""

""Don't be dramatic.."" He said, sounding annoyed. ""That's the ego talking. Always wanting to be the protagonist of a tragedy. You aren't in hell. You're just in a quiet place. A place where things run down.""

He pointed to the pillar again.

""The rust doesn't hurt the iron."" He said. ""It just changes it. It makes it softer. It makes it part of the earth again.""

I sat there for a long time. I thought about my apartment. I thought about the keys hitting the floor. I thought about the silence I had wanted.

I had wanted to stop the noise. I had wanted the struggle to end.

I looked at my arm again. The patch was spreading. It didn't itch. It didn't hurt. It just felt... Heavy.

I realized then that the old man was right. I wasn't a prophet. I wasn't a hero. I was just a tired machine that had finally found a scrapyard.

The horror of it washed over me, but it was a slow, viscous horror. It didn't make me want to scream. It made me want to sleep.

I leaned my head back against the concrete wall. I closed my eyes.

""Okay."" I whispered.

""Okay…"" The old man said.

We sat in the dark, and we listened to the building settle around us. We listened to the slow, chemical work of time. We listened to ourselves disappearing.

It’s filled with hope, sure, but let’s be honest, it can also be incredibly nerve wracking for everyone involved. The structured, safe environment of the treatment center is replaced by the familiar, and sometimes triggering, world of home. This transition is where many struggles begin, and it’s precisely where the support of a sober companion becomes invaluable.

Think about it. You can’t live in rehab forever. Suddenly, the person in early recovery is faced with the same old streets, the same daily stresses, and maybe even the same social circles that were part of their previous life. It’s a lot to handle. This is where a [sober companion](https://recoverycarepartner.com/recovery-services/) steps in, not as a warden, but as a grounded, professional presence. They’re like a bridge between the intensive work of rehab and the challenge of real-world living.

A sober companion provides more than just accountability, though that’s a big part of it. They’re a real-life guide for navigating the mundane stuff that can feel overwhelming. They can help fill the empty hours that used to be dedicated to addiction with new, healthy routines. Maybe that means going to a meeting together, hitting the gym, or just being there to talk through a tough moment over coffee. It’s that consistent, calm presence that makes all the difference.

For families, this support is a lifeline. It takes the immense pressure off you to be the constant watchdog, a role that is exhausting and can harm your relationship. Instead, you can start to just be a family again. The sober companion handles the tough conversations about triggers and cravings, allowing you to focus on rebuilding trust and connection.

Ultimately, the goal of a sober companion from a place like Recovery Care Partner isn’t to create a dependency. It’s the exact opposite. They provide the tools and confidence so that the individual can eventually walk their path independently. They help turn a fragile recovery into a resilient one, making the four walls of a house feel not like a trap, but like a true home, a safe foundation for a new way of living. It’s about making sure the incredible progress made in treatment doesn’t get lost in translation at the front door.",1,1767536380.0,Life_Begins,0,1.0,False

Most modern smart plugs are designed to connect with Google's voice assistant right out of the box.

**How Smart Plugs Connect to Google Home**

When you get smart plugs, you'll need to connect them to your Wi-Fi network first. Then you can link them to Google Home through the Google Home app on your phone. The whole process usually takes about 5 minutes per plug.

Popular smart plug brands like TP-Link Kasa, Amazon Smart Plug, and Wyze all work with Google Assistant. You just need to make sure the plug you buy says ""Works with Google Assistant"" on the package.

**What You Can Do With Voice Control**

Once your smart plugs are connected, you can control any device plugged into them using voice commands. Say things like ""Hey Google, turn on the living room lamp"" or ""Hey Google, turn off the coffee maker."" 

You can also set up routines where multiple smart plugs turn on or off together. For example, saying ""Good morning"" could turn on your coffee maker, desk lamp, and radio all at once.

**Setting Up Your Smart Home**

Smart plugs are one of the cheapest ways to make your home smarter. They let you control regular appliances, lamps, fans, and other devices without replacing them entirely. You can find quality smart plugs that work with Google Home [here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs).

**Scheduling and Remote Control**

Beyond voice control, you can schedule your smart plugs to turn devices on and off automatically. Set your bedroom lamp to turn on at sunset or have your phone charger turn off after two hours to save energy.

The Google Home app also lets you control your smart plugs when you're away from home. Forgot to turn off the iron? No problem - just open the app and switch it off remotely.

**Choosing the Right Smart Plugs**

Look for smart plugs with good reviews and reliable Wi-Fi connections. Some plugs work only with 2.4GHz networks, so check your router settings if you have connection issues. 

Mini smart plugs are great if you need to use both outlets, while standard-sized plugs often have better antennas for stronger connections. You can compare different options and find the best smart plugs for Google Home [here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs).

Smart plugs make your daily routine more convenient and can even help you save money on electricity bills. They're a simple first step into home automation that works perfectly with Google Home.",1,1767536235.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False
1q3r09a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSCA/comments/1q3r09a/taking_the_csca_home_exam_in_jan_handdrawn_guide/,Taking the CSCA Home Exam in Jan? Hand-drawn Guide on How Not to Get Disqualified (Based on Dec Real Stories),"Hey everyone,

If you are applying to Chinese universities (Tsinghua, ZJU, HITSZ, etc.) for the 2026 intake, you probably know about the new **CSCA (China Scholastic Competency Assessment)** requirement.

I just went through the December 21st exam cycle with a group of about 3,500 applicants, and it was... chaotic. The ""Home-based"" monitoring system is **NOT** like the digital SAT or regular online mocks. It is incredibly strict, and the official handbook is massive and confusing.

We saw dozens of students get flagged or disqualified for technical reasons that had nothing to do with their academic ability. To save you from the same fate in January, here is a breakdown of the **10 Technical Traps** you need to avoid.

*(Source: Official Handbook analysis + real student feedback from the Dec cohort)*

# The Hardware Traps

**1. The ""MacBook"" Trap (CRITICAL)**  
**DO NOT** try to use a Mac. The official software only runs on **Windows 10/11 (64-bit)**. Virtual Machines (VMs) are banned and will flag the anti-cheat system.

* *Fix:* Beg, borrow, or steal (okay, don't steal) a Windows laptop now. Test it during the mock window.

**2. The Secondary Camera ""Blind Spot""**  
You can't just prop your phone against a coffee mug. The proctor needs a specific angle: **1.5 meters behind you, 45 degrees to the side.**

* *The Catch:* The camera must see **Your Upper Body + Your Screen + Your Hands** all at once. If your phone slips or the angle is wrong, they will pause your exam to make you fix it (killing your time and focus).
* *Fix:* Buy a cheap tripod. It's $10 and saves your score.

**3. The ""Battery"" Death**  
Your secondary device (phone) is streaming video for 2+ hours. It WILL die.

* *Fix:* Keep it plugged into a charger or power bank the entire time.

# The Rules You Might Miss

**4. The ""Scratch Paper"" Ban**  
You CANNOT use regular paper and pen.  
The rule is: **Small Whiteboard + Erasable Marker** (or a blank paper inside a transparent plastic sheet).

* *Why:* You have to **ERASE** your notes in front of the camera before submitting. Permanent notes = suspicion of leaking questions.

**5. The ""Do Not Disturb"" Disaster**  
If your mom calls you on your secondary monitoring phone during the exam, the video feed cuts. If the feed cuts for too long -> **Disqualified**.

* *Fix:* Turn on ""Do Not Disturb"" but make sure the browser/app has permission to overlay. Better yet, remove the SIM card and use Wi-Fi only.

**6. Background Processes (Task Manager)**  
The software is aggressive. It flags TeamViewer, AnyDesk, and even **WeChat/TikTok** running in the background.

* *Fix:* Open Task Manager and kill absolutely everything that isn't the exam software.

**7. The VPN Dilemma**  
This is tricky for international students. The handbook says ""No VPNs,"" but the server is in China.

* *Reality:* During the Dec exam, some students needed VPNs to load the login page, but had to turn them off for the test. It depends on your region.
* *Fix:* Test your ping *without* VPN during the equipment check. If it's <500 KB/s, you need a different network solution.

# Behavioral Flags

**8. The ""Wandering Eye""**  
The AI tracks your gaze. If you go away during the test, it flags ""Suspicious Behavior.""

* *Fix:* Don't go away...?

**9. No Bathroom Breaks**  
Zero. None. Once you click start, you cannot leave the camera frame.

* *Fix:* Go before. Don't chug a liter of water before the Math section.

**10. Do NOT Exit Early**  
After you click ""Submit,"" do not close the software.

* *The ""Corpse Inspection"":* You have to wait for the proctor to make you erase your whiteboard and show your ID front/back to the camera. If you disconnect before this, your score is void.

# Final Thoughts

The exam itself is hard if you are underprepared (Math was heavily Trig/Geometry skewed, Physics was Electromagnetism heavy), but failing because of a webcam angle is just tragic.

Documentation is key. Read the handbook three times.

**Need Help?**  
If you are still confused about the setup, or want to see the **""Recall Questions""** from the December exam to know what to study (since the Syllabus lied to us about Calculus):

We have a Discord community of **3,500+ applicants** helping each other out. We share resources, study plans, and troubleshoot tech issues in real-time on exam day.

1q3r02k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1q3r02k/i_finally_broke_the_cycle_of_starting_and/,I finally broke the cycle of starting and quitting - Here's what actually worked,"I've spent the last 5 years struggling with the same pattern. Get excited about self-improvement, start strong for 2-3 weeks, then completely abandon everything and feel worse than before. Rinse and repeat every few months.

But something clicked 6 months ago, and for the first time, I've maintained consistent habits without the exhausting cycle of motivation and burnout. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but the difference is night and day.

Here's what finally worked:

Making habits ridiculously small

I stopped trying to meditate for 30 minutes and instead committed to 1 minute. I didn't try to read 30 pages, just 3. Working out became a 5-minute commitment, not 45 minutes.

What happened stunned me - on most days, I'd naturally do more once I started. But having the tiny commitment meant I never skipped because ""I don't have time"" or ""I'm too tired.""

Attaching new habits to existing ones

This was game-changing. Instead of randomly trying to remember to do things, I attached each new habit to something I already do without thinking:

After brushing teeth → 1-minute meditation

After making morning coffee → 3 pages of reading

After getting home from work → 5-minute workout

The existing habit became the trigger for the new one, eliminating the need for motivation or remembering.

Tracking streaks, but with a twist

I used to abandon everything after missing one day. Now I use the ""never miss twice"" rule. Missing once is normal and human. Missing twice in a row is the beginning of a new pattern. This simple reframe removed the shame spiral that would always derail me.

Identity over outcomes

The biggest shift was stopping phrases like ""I'm trying to read more"" and starting to say ""I'm a reader."" When you shift from attempting behaviors to claiming an identity, consistency becomes much easier. Every small action is reinforcing who you are, not just checking off a to-do.

The difference in my mental health, focus, and general well-being has been profound, and it didn't require superhuman discipline or motivation. Just smarter systems and a more forgiving approach.

Anyone else find success with similar approaches? Or struggling with the starting/quitting cycle?",2,1767536207.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False
