# Chapter 21: Glass Light

The cafeteria was alive with noon chatter—the clink of trays, the shuffle of chairs, the hum of midday fatigue barely masked by sugar and caffeine.

Kazuya entered quietly, clutching a tray with rice, miso soup, and a half-eaten sandwich he didn’t remember buying.

He scanned the room once. Saw a sea of unfamiliar faces. None of them looked up.

Perfect.

He walked toward the farthest seat—one tucked near the windows, where sunlight slanted across the floor in soft rectangles. He set his tray down carefully, sat, and stared at his food.

*You said you’d try. This counts. Sitting here counts.*

He picked at the sandwich. The bread was dry. He chewed anyway.

A few tables over, three students walked into the cafeteria, and for a moment, the volume of the room dropped a notch.

They weren’t just any students—they were **the Triad**.

**Yuto Nakamura**, tall and broad-shouldered, had the posture of someone used to carrying a team—and winning. His black hair was tousled just enough to look careless but never messy. In his varsity jacket and effortlessly cool demeanor, he radiated confidence honed on the university basketball courts.

**Naomi Tanaka-Wright** walked beside him with quiet poise. Her toned frame carried the elegance of a national-level tennis player. She wore a fitted white windbreaker over her navy top, her honey-brown ponytail swaying with each step. She exuded calm—the kind that drew attention without demanding it. Born to a Japanese mother and an American father, her bilingual fluency and magnetic clarity made her a favorite of both faculty and students.

**Reina Lemoine-Tachibana** trailed slightly behind, yet she somehow stood at the center of it all. Half-French, half-Japanese, her beauty was cinematic. Amber-tinted waves framed her expressive face, and her pastel-toned blouse and high-waist skirt seemed casually pulled from a fashion shoot. Known as the campus belle, she led the performing arts club, starred in most productions, and had a voice that made even passing compliments sound like poetry.

Wherever the three went, the mood changed.

Some whispered. Others stared.

The cafeteria became more alert, like a scene waiting for its leads to speak.

They took their usual table—center-left, just enough to be seen, never too far to be excluded.

Reina leaned her elbows onto the table, peering toward the far side of the room. “He’s giving haunted protagonist energy,” she murmured. “You know, the type who writes poetry at midnight and forgets to eat.”

Yuto snorted, biting into a rice ball. “Or the type who drops dead during practice because he skipped breakfast for a ‘spiritual awakening.’”

Naomi, ever composed, tilted her head. “He looks like he hasn’t slept in days. But it’s not a mess. It’s… intentional. Like he’s choosing to keep the world out.”

Reina hummed. “Mmm. There’s something watchable about that. Doesn’t feel like an act.”

Yuto shook his head. “Still doesn’t explain why *she* walked him in. I mean, *her* of all people?”

Naomi gave him a look. “You’ve been in her class. She’s all sharp edges and syllabus warnings. No small talk. No hand-holding.”

Reina’s voice dropped slightly. “She’s never even acknowledged a student by name outside class.”

Yuto pointed with his chopsticks. “And yet, she tapped his shoulder. Said something. Smiled. That’s not a glitch. That’s a *data breach*.”

Naomi narrowed her eyes. “Maybe he’s related to someone on the board.”

Reina wasn’t looking at them anymore. Her gaze lingered across the cafeteria. “No. It wasn’t obligation. It felt... deliberate.”

Yuto leaned in. “You’re seriously interested?”

Reina shrugged, slow and thoughtful. “I’m curious. That’s all.”

Naomi didn’t press, but her glance toward Reina was knowing.

From across the room, Bayer-sensei stepped through the cafeteria door, a coffee in her hand.

Conversation dimmed slightly.

She always had that effect. Her presence bent the room—not with fear, but gravity.

As she walked, students straightened. Some whispered. Others looked away entirely.

She didn’t stop. Didn’t smile.

Until she did.

She turned toward the window.

Toward him.

Kazuya didn’t see her until her shadow crossed his tray.

He looked up.

Their eyes met. For a moment, neither spoke.

Then she leaned down, just slightly, and placed her hand gently on his shoulder.

“If you need help adjusting, Kinoshita-san,” she said softly, “I’m one message away.”

It wasn’t flirtation. It wasn’t ceremony. It was simple, clean. Meant.

She walked off before he could respond.

But the cafeteria didn’t move.

Every nearby table had frozen mid-conversation.

“Did you see that?” someone whispered.

“Wait—did she *touch* him?”

“I’ve never even heard her *speak* like that.”

“I didn’t know her face could smile.”

Even Reina stared wide-eyed. “That was… kind of beautiful.”

Yuto blinked. “Or dangerous.”

Naomi’s voice was soft. “It was human.”

Kazuya sat still.

Her fingers had barely touched his hoodie, but he felt it like a brand.

*She didn’t have to do that.*

He didn’t move. Didn’t speak. But for the first time, he looked up—really looked—and met Reina’s gaze across the room.

She didn’t wave this time.

She just smiled. Softly.

He blinked.

Then slowly, almost imperceptibly, nodded.

*Better than yesterday,* he thought. *That’s enough.*

The clatter of trays resumed, but it felt muted—like the room hadn’t quite returned to its axis. People laughed again, yes, but it was thinner, glancing. Something had shifted.

Reina twirled her juice with the end of her straw. The melting ice clicked softly against the plastic walls. Her gaze hadn't left the back of Kazuya Kinoshita’s head.

He hadn’t looked at her again.

Not even after that tap. That voice. That whisper of warmth from Bayer-sensei of all people.

Reina leaned forward slightly, resting her chin on her hand. Her tone was light, but her thoughts swam beneath the surface.

So that’s what makes the Ice Queen melt.

She didn’t mean it to be cruel. Not really. It was curiosity. Fascination. Bayer-sensei was a study in distance, a snow sculpture given tenure. She’d once corrected a student’s grammar mid-breakdown. Reina had admired the woman’s restraint. And now she’d watched that same woman break it—for him.

What are you, Kinoshita?

Not a model. Not a jock. He didn’t move like someone used to being seen. He moved like someone trying to disappear between heartbeats.

“Rei?” Naomi’s voice pulled her back. “You okay?”

Reina smiled, soft and quick. “Yeah.”

Yuto was still watching Kazuya too, though his expression was more irritated than intrigued.

“I don’t like it,” he muttered. “The vibe. The weirdness.”

Reina stirred her drink again. “Not everything that makes you uncomfortable is dangerous, Yuto.”

He shrugged. “Maybe. But I’ve seen quiet guys implode before.”

She didn’t answer. She just kept watching.

Kazuya finished his meal slowly, like he had nowhere else to go. When he stood to clear his tray, he didn’t flinch at the whispers. He didn’t respond. He didn’t even scowl.

He just moved.

And for the first time in a long time, Reina felt her fingers itch—not to post, not to perform, but to write. To understand the shape of his silence.

*You’re not just broken,* she thought. *You’re restrained.*

That, more than anything, made her lean back in her chair and smile to herself.

*Now I’m interested.*

# Chapter 22: In A Rush

Kazuya barely remembered how the day ended. The lectures passed like low tide—gentle, repetitive waves that washed over his notebook without soaking in. The sounds of pencils scratching, shoes scuffing tile, chairs squeaking on linoleum—it all blurred into white noise.

It wasn’t until the bell rang that he jolted upright.

*The interview.*

7:00 PM.

He looked at his phone. 5:52.

He muttered something under his breath, slung his bag over his shoulder, and all but ran through the corridor. Students were still lingering, some laughing, some scrolling through their phones, others standing by the vending machines.

He was halfway through buttoning his shirt, backpack swinging, when he bumped into someone hard enough to drop her folder.

“Oh crap—sorry!”

Reina blinked, caught in the middle of a half-turn. Kazuya stood in front of her, wild-eyed, shirt half-buttoned, breath shallow.

“You okay?” she asked, crouching instinctively to pick up her folder.

*He looks like someone who just saw the edge of something.*

He exhaled. “Yeah—yeah, I’m really sorry. I’ve got an interview. Aquarium. DMM—or, uh—whatever it’s called here.”

Naomi and Yuto were a few steps behind. Yuto raised an eyebrow. “He talks now?”

Naomi gave him a light elbow. “Let him go.”

Reina smiled faintly as Kazuya stepped back, bowing slightly. “Good luck,” she said.

*Why does that feel too small a phrase?* Reina thought, watching him retreat. *He’s not rushing to a job. He’s running from something.*

He made it to the aquarium just as the sky turned lavender. The complex was more elegant than he expected—glass walls catching the last of the sun, a sprawling entryway with signs in four languages.

The interview was short, professional. They needed part-timers for the front desk and night rotation. He didn’t fumble, didn’t stutter. He just... answered.

“I like being around quiet things,” he said when asked why he applied.

The manager smiled. “Most people say ‘fish.’ But okay.”

Afterward, they told him to wait two days for final word. He nodded, bowed, and found himself wandering the tanks.

He ended up in the whale hall.

The glass dome overhead reflected blue and green from the light below. Manta rays drifted like ghosts. A whale shark cut through the water in slow, graceful rhythm.

Kazuya stood there, the world silent around him. His reflection stared back in fractured glass.

Then—

“Kazuya?”

His heart jumped.

That voice. Soft. Female. Familiar in a way that curled into his ribs.

He turned. For a split second—

“Chizu—?”

But it wasn’t.

Braided hair. Calm poise. Lab ID hanging from her lanyard.

The woman who tapped his shoulder on the bus.

The woman who walked him into class.

The woman whose name he still didn’t know.

He blinked.

She raised an eyebrow. “Did I scare you?”

He managed a tired half-smile. “A little.”

“I didn’t expect to see you here,” she said. “You left in quite a rush earlier.”

Kazuya scratched the back of his neck. “Yeah… sorry about that.”

“Interview?”

He nodded. “Yeah.”

She looked at him for a second longer than necessary.

*Still not present. Still half in a memory.*

“Well,” she said, turning slightly, “Welcome to the aquarium, if they take you. I’m assigned here part-time. Marine observation and behavior.”

She started to walk past him, then paused.

“You said Chizuru.”

He froze.

“…I did.”

She didn’t ask more.

Didn’t press.

She just looked at him for a beat, then nodded once.

*You’re not ready. But you’re trying.*

“I’ll see you around.”

And then she was gone.

Kazuya exhaled.

His heart was still thudding—not from the mistake, but from the clarity.

He wasn’t done.

He wasn’t over her.

But maybe—*maybe*—he wasn’t going to drown either.

# Chapter 23: A Month of Almost

It happened slowly.

Like tide smoothing over sharp stones, Kazuya began to change.

The first days of the semester had passed in a blur—he walked through them like a shadow, always on the edge of the room, always avoiding center stage. But by the fourth week, something had shifted.

The laughter started first.

It wasn't loud. It wasn't confident. But it was real.

Kazuya didn’t even realize he’d laughed until he noticed Reina looking back at him with a faint smile. It was during one of Bayer-sensei’s terrible puns about coral polyps. He chuckled under his breath, then glanced around, half-embarrassed. His hand instinctively went up to cover his mouth.

*Did that come from me?*

From three rows back, Reina blinked. Then smiled.

*He doesn’t laugh easily. But when he does, it looks like the truth.*

Reina wasn’t sure when she started noticing him.

It wasn’t deliberate. She was used to watching people—reading their gestures, the lies they told with their posture. But Kazuya? He didn’t perform. He didn’t chase attention. He moved like he was made of shadows and salt.

But she noticed the small things. The way he now nodded when Naomi greeted him. The way he borrowed a pen from Yuto. The way he listened more closely during lectures.

And the way he laughed that day.

That laugh stayed in her chest longer than she liked to admit.

Later that night, she stared at her sketchpad and found a single line scribbled across the margin:

“Some people smile like it costs them.”

She didn’t know if it was about him. But the thought lingered.

Elsa had noticed too.

She had been mid-lecture, explaining coral ecosystems and how the bleaching process disrupted the reef.

""Remember, coral polyps aren’t plants, even if they act like... couch potatoes.""

A few students laughed. A light chuckle here and there.

But his… his laugh wasn’t amusement.

It was relief.

She glanced up.

He was smiling. Barely. But there it was.

His posture had changed. The line of his shoulders—no longer clenched. The eyes, no longer hollow. The mask of silence, no longer absolute.

Elsa stared just a second longer than necessary.

*He’s starting to stay,* she thought. *Not just physically. But emotionally.*

Back at her desk that evening, she opened her notes to prepare for the next session. She added fewer facts. More questions. And beside the bullet point “Encourage discussion,” she wrote in small, italic handwriting:

“Let him speak when he’s ready. Don’t rush him.”

Outside the lecture hall one morning, Reina and Elsa passed each other by the vending machines.

A brief glance. A polite nod.

Neither said anything.

But both had seen it.

The boy who laughed.

The boy who was starting to belong.

And neither of them tried to own it. They simply watched, from a respectful distance, something blooming where silence once lived.

# Chapter 24: Bro Talk

It started with the ball.

Not a word, not a plan. Just the clean echo of rubber meeting polished wood in an empty university gym.

Kazuya didn’t expect anyone else to be there. He was early. Too early. The sun was barely up, the sky still that unsure shade between night and morning. He came because the silence helped him think. Because his chest had been heavy for days and running hadn’t helped.

*Maybe I needed to feel something other than the ache of pretending I was okay.*

Then came the voice.

“Oi, ghost boy. You just gonna stare or you wanna move your feet?”

Kazuya turned, startled. Yuto was at the half-court line, spinning the ball lazily on one finger. His grin was relaxed, but there was something sharp behind his eyes—not judgment, just awareness. Like he knew something Kazuya didn’t.

“I—uh... I don’t really play.”

“You don’t really breathe either. Maybe this helps.”

There was no pressure in the offer. Just a hand, held out. A choice.

Kazuya stepped onto the court.

At first, it was awkward. His movements stiff. His grip on the ball too tight. He hadn’t held one in over a year.

*What am I even doing here?*

But muscle memory is a stubborn thing.

The shots started missing less. His footing adjusted. A bounce pass here, a fake-out there. Sweat started to gather at the collar of his shirt. His breathing steadied, not just from exertion, but from focus.

And then came the swish. A clean arc, the net whispering acceptance.

Yuto raised an eyebrow. “Huh. So you’ve been sandbagging us.”

Kazuya shrugged, trying not to smile. “Used to play. A long time ago.”

They went quiet again, letting the ball speak.

Yuto passed. Kazuya caught. Shot. Another swish.

“You know Reina thought you were mute the first week,” Yuto said casually. “And Naomi was placing bets on you being a secret monk.”

Kazuya laughed. For real. Not forced. Not polite. It echoed in the gym, foreign in his throat.

“I’m not trying to be mysterious.”

“No, but you carry silence like it’s armor.”

Kazuya paused. The ball sat still in his hands.

*Armor. Yeah... That’s what I made it, didn’t I?*

“I came here to reset. Not to be seen.”

“Tough luck. People notice when someone walks like they’re learning how to be human again.”

They took a break by the bleachers. Water bottles. Cool air. Their breathing slowed.

“I was... kind of a mess before I got here,” Kazuya admitted. “I thought distance would help.”

“Did it?”

He didn’t answer at first. Then:

“Some days, yeah. Other days, I still wake up thinking I have something to prove to people who aren’t watching anymore.”

*I still hear her voice in my sleep. Still see the look in her eyes when she said goodbye.*

“They don’t need to be watching. You are,” Yuto said.

“Is that enough?”

“Better be. ‘Cause you’re the one living this story.”

Yuto had seen broken before. Not just in sports. In life. In teammates who lost parents, in classmates who quit mid-season, in kids who smiled like they weren’t allowed to cry. But Kazuya’s quiet wasn’t emptiness. It was heavy.

It carried the weight of someone who gave too much and learned the hard way that not everyone stays.

So when Kazuya said he wanted to surf, Yuto didn’t laugh.

He lit up.

“Tuesday mornings. No excuses.”

And when Kazuya fist-bumped him back, there was a flicker of something new.

Not healing. Not yet.

But hunger.

As they walked out of the gym together, the sky fully awake now, Kazuya realized something.

*I don’t want to disappear anymore.*

*I want to belong.*

Even if it took time.

Even if he had to start with just one person who saw him clearly.

# Chapter 25: Bell Rings, Tides Turn

The hallway clock read 8:30 a.m.

The bell had already rung. Twice.

But laughter echoed near the stairwell—low and warm, like waves pulling against the shore.

Kazuya was walking with Yuto, animated in a way that felt almost unnatural to his own body, like he had borrowed someone else's voice and forgotten to return it. Yet the smile tugging at his lips was real. He hadn’t worn that expression in years.

Naomi and Reina trailed behind.

""You know,"" Naomi whispered, grinning, ""that’s the first time I’ve seen Kazuya laugh out loud.""

Reina didn’t respond immediately. Her gaze was fixed on Kazuya.

*He was always early. Always seated before the bell. Never with anyone. Never smiling.*

*Now he walks in the sun like he belongs here. Like the pain he carried folded itself into something livable.*

The classroom door slid open with a dry hush.

Heads turned.

At the podium, Elsa Bayer's chalk paused mid-curve on the board. She turned, the soft click of her heels marking the tension.

Yuto offered a crooked grin. Naomi looked like she was trying not to laugh. Reina straightened her blazer.

But it was Kazuya who bowed first.

""Apologies, Sensei. I lost track of time.""

His voice was low. Calm. Unapologetically honest.

The class held its breath.

Elsa's eyes met his.

*You're never late, Kazuya Kinoshita. Yet here you are. Smiling like you're not afraid anymore.*

Her expression didn’t waver.

""Sit down. Don’t make it a habit.""

The group nodded and took their seats.

Kazuya slid into his chair beside Yuto. His shirt was still ruffled from the walk, his breath just a little uneven. But inside, there was no flinch.

*I’m late for the first time since moving here. But why don’t I feel bad?*

*Maybe because I finally have people to be late with.*

The lesson resumed.

Elsa picked up the chalk and asked a question on coral bleaching. Silence stretched until Kazuya’s hand rose.

""Temperature variance. Especially prolonged warming.""

Correct.

More questions followed. Kazuya answered each one with the measured ease of someone who read not to impress, but to understand.

And then, he asked his own.

""Would coral symbiosis respond differently depending on latitude-specific tidal stress?""

A few students blinked. One even lowered their pencil, surprised.

Elsa paused.

*You’re not here to take notes. You’re here to think.*

She nodded. ""That’s a good question. We’ll dive into that next week.""

Whispers flickered like breeze through the classroom.

""He’s on fire.""

""I didn’t even understand that question.""

As the lesson progressed, Kazuya not only answered—he challenged. Referencing articles, asking about contradictory findings, engaging Elsa in what resembled more a discussion between peers than student and teacher.

""Wouldn’t that contradict Professor Mizushima’s 2021 Okinawa report?""

Elsa blinked. ""Are you referring to the divergence in site B?""

""Yes. The post-typhoon sediment displacement.""

A longer pause.

Then Elsa’s lips curled, ever so slightly.

""You’ve read well. We’ll examine that tomorrow.""

Naomi leaned closer to Reina.

""He’s *debating* with Bayer. Like, comfortably.""

Reina said nothing.

*He’s no longer the shadow. He’s light. And she’s letting him shine.*

Yuto, leaning back with arms crossed, shook his head with a smile.

*Basketball, coral science, what’s next—piano prodigy? This guy’s the real deal.*

As the bell rang, bags rustled and chairs scraped the floor. Kazuya stood, collecting his things. Yuto slapped his back. Naomi gave him a grin.

Reina moved slower.

Elsa didn’t say anything, didn’t meet his eye. But her chalk lingered above the board.

*He challenged me. And I liked it.*

And for a brief moment, as he exited, every eye turned toward him.

Not as a transfer student. Not as the ghost in the back row.

But as someone worth seeing.

# Chapter 26: The Challenge

The cafeteria buzzed with its usual midday rhythm—trays clattering, conversations mixing, laughter bouncing off linoleum floors. But something was different today. A current in the air. Unspoken, but felt.

Kazuya stepped into it with hesitant steps, just behind Yuto, whose confidence seemed to part the crowd like waves. Naomi and Reina were already at their usual table.

Yuto spotted them and raised his hand. ""Yo, Kazuya! Over here.""

It was loud enough to cut through the chatter.

Eyes turned.

Kazuya froze for half a breath.

Then he moved. Past stares. Past whispers.

He sat.

*So this is what it feels like,* Kazuya thought. *To be seen, and still be welcomed.*

Reina watched silently.

*He sat without flinching.* *The same boy who avoided eye contact now smiles like he belongs.*

Naomi nudged her tray toward Kazuya. ""Didn't think you'd actually join. Welcome to the chaos.""

He gave a soft smile. ""Feels strange. Like I’m crashing a party.""

""You’re not,"" Yuto said, tearing into his rice bowl. ""You built your own invite.""

Before the warmth could settle, a shadow fell over them.

""Well, well. The Triad plus one.""

Kaito Arakawa.

Basketball captain. Swagger incarnate. A thorn in Yuto's side since middle school.

His eyes found Reina first, then reluctantly scanned the group before landing on Yuto.

""Still dodging me, Yuto?""

Yuto didn’t bother to stand. ""Still talking like anyone’s listening?""

Naomi rolled her eyes. Reina stiffened.

Kaito leaned on the table. ""Two-on-two. Today. You and anyone here.""

Then, smugly: ""If we win, one date with Reina and Naomi. Pictures optional.""

Reina’s fork clinked hard against her tray.

Naomi stood. ""Over my dead body.""

Yuto's jaw tightened. He rose slowly. ""You trying to get decked?""

Kazuya stood too.

""Yuto, don’t.""

All eyes shifted to him.

*I used to disappear in moments like this,* Kazuya thought. *But not this time.*

His voice was calm. ""If you need to gamble on women to feel seen, I feel bad for you.""

The room fell quiet.

Kaito stepped back, jaw clenched. ""Then we’ll see if your game matches your mouth. Four o'clock.""

He left.

Naomi let out a breath. ""He’s the worst.""

Reina watched Kazuya, her heart somewhere between admiration and worry.

*He didn’t shout. Didn’t bluff.* *He just stood like the ground belonged to him.*

Kazuya sat again, his hands still trembling slightly.

Yuto laughed. ""You’ve got a dramatic flair, man.""

""You free after class?"" Kazuya asked.

Yuto blinked. ""You wanna train?""

Kazuya nodded. ""Let’s skip one class.""

Naomi gaped. ""You? Skip?""

He chuckled softly. ""I used to skip all the time in Tokyo. I didn’t care. I just read about the ocean, mostly. That’s how I ended up here.""

Yuto grinned. ""Then let’s go win one.""

They hit the court, sneakers squeaking against sunbaked pavement.

Kazuya was off-beat at first. Passes too soft. Shots bouncing wide.

Yuto adjusted quickly, guiding him without words.

Reina watched from the bleachers.

*He’s not polished. But there’s fire. Controlled. Raw.*

Naomi leaned over. ""He’s surprising, huh?""

Reina didn’t answer. Her gaze lingered.

Above, Elsa stood by a second-floor window.

She hadn’t meant to watch.

But she couldn’t look away.

*Kazuya Kinoshita. You keep unspooling in layers I didn’t account for.* *You show up. You fight back. You glow.*

Down on the court, Yuto tossed the ball to Kazuya, who sank a clean three.

Naomi whispered, ""That was smooth.""

Reina smiled faintly. *Too smooth.*

Kazuya looked up, brushing hair from his eyes.

He didn’t see Elsa.

He didn’t see Reina.

He just breathed.

*I’m still afraid.* *But for the first time, I want to fight.*

# Chapter 27: Pressure

The court was already swarming when Kazuya and Yuto arrived. Students lined the chain-link fence, some leaning over the railing of the second-floor corridor. The buzz in the air was electric—phones out, chatter loud, bets whispered between friends.

This wasn’t just a casual two-on-two.

This had become an event.

The sun bore down heavy on the concrete, heat shimmering across the paint lines. Kazuya bounced the ball once, testing the ground. He could already feel sweat along his collar.

*He hadn’t played like this in years. Not for fun. Not in front of people.*

The buzz of the crowd felt like static in his bones.

*Why are they even here? I’m not worth watching.*

Flashbacks flickered—stuttering over class presentations in Tokyo, blanking out during a school basketball game, laughter echoing when he tripped on his own foot. His grip on the ball felt slippery—not from sweat, but from that old fear gnawing its way back to the surface.

Kaito stood across from him, smirking. His teammate—a second-string varsity guard with quick feet and a mean jab-step—was stretching casually, as if the outcome was already decided.

Kaito stepped forward, tossing the ball to Kazuya with a flick of his wrist.

""Let’s see if the ghost boy knows how to dribble.""

Kazuya caught it.

No reaction. No bite.

He turned to Yuto and whispered, ""Focus on him. Kaito. He wants Reina’s attention. Take him out of rhythm.""

Yuto raised an eyebrow, smirking. ""I like that edge.""

Kaito overheard. ""That all you got? Trash talk and borrowed confidence?""

Kazuya simply bounced the ball once, eyes steady.

*No. I’ve seen real pain. This isn’t it. This is noise.*

**The Game Begins - Score: 0-0**

Kaito starts the game with an aggressive drive, crashing through a weak screen. Layup. 1-0.

Next possession, Kazuya dribbles—stripped. Fast break by Kaito's teammate. Layup. 2-0.

Yuto grabs the rebound on the next play, creates his own shot. 2-1.

Kaito fakes left, spins right—clean floater over Kazuya. 3-1.

Kazuya tries a response but travels.

Crowd: “He’s nervous!”

Kaito gets double-teamed. Passes out, ball swung back. Three-pointer from the corner. 5-1.

*Kazuya’s chest tightens. He’s sweating hard now, too early. Too much.*

Yuto makes a strong drive—2 points. 5-2.

Kazuya attempts a lay-up. Blocked. Fast break by Kaito. 6-2.

Whispered comments: “Why is Triad carrying this guy?” “He’s not even trying.”

Elsa watches from the second-floor window, silent. Arms crossed.

Reina leans forward on the bench.

*You’re spiraling. Stop looking at the crowd. Look at Yuto. Look at us.*

Naomi’s arms are folded, lips drawn tight.

“He’s better than this,” she mutters.

Yuto gets aggressive. Three-pointer. 6-4.

Kaito responds with a powerful spin. Scores again. 7-4.

*I’m dragging him down. I’m dragging them all down.*

Another turnover. Kazuya throws a pass too hard—it sails out of bounds. Groans from the fence.

Timeout called. Yuto walks over, claps his shoulder.

**Timeout. Midcourt. Crowd buzzing.**

“You think I asked you to play because you’re perfect?”

Kazuya stares down.

“I asked because I trust you’ll show up. Doesn’t matter if you’re scared. You just need to stop running.”

“I can handle the game. I need you to handle you.”

Kazuya doesn’t speak.

*I’ve failed before. I’ve choked before. And yet, they still pulled me in.*

He breathes in. Out. Nods.

**Return Play – Score Rises: 7-4**

Yuto scores. Then assists. 7-6.

Kaito draws double-team, forces a shot, misses. Rebound by Yuto.

Kazuya finds space—baseline jumper. Nails it. 7-7.

*Small rhythm. Don’t overthink. Just play.*

Kaito strikes again—quick jab-step, mid-range pull-up. 8-7.

Yuto answers with a three. 9-8.

Kaito charges in, gets fouled. No call. Still scores. 9-9.

Yuto hits another three. 11-9.

Kaito makes two in a row. 11-11.

Fast break from Kazuya, he passes to Yuto. Score. 12-11.

Kaito: drive and kick. Teammate makes it. 12-12.

Yuto back to Kazuya. He shoots. It goes in. 13-12.

Kaito drives again. Too strong. Still makes it. 13-13.

Kazuya fakes a screen. Slips behind. Yuto lobs. He finishes. 14-13.

Kaito responds. Isolation. Fakes. Shoots. 14-14.

*Heartbeat like a war drum. The court is a cage. I can’t leave now.*

Kazuya wipes sweat off his brow. Looks to Yuto.

Yuto simply smiles.

“You ready to shut them up?”

Kazuya nods, then grinned.

# Chapter 28: Game Over

The sun had lowered enough that the court was bathed in a golden-orange hue. Long shadows stretched across the faded paint lines, and the crowd pressed in tighter, sensing something was coming.

Kazuya stood at center court, chest heaving.

Yuto clapped a hand on his back. “You good?”

Kazuya didn’t answer right away. His gaze drifted to Kaito—still smirking, still bouncing on the balls of his feet like he already owned the game.

Kazuya turned to Yuto. “Leave him to me.”

Yuto blinked. “You sure?”

Kazuya nodded. “Just keep the other guy busy. I’ll take care of him.”

*He’s loud. Not just his voice—his movements, his presence. He’s trying to swallow the court whole.*  
*But it’s noise. All of it. And I’ve lived with noise my whole life.*

**Score: 14–14**

Kaito scored on a contested lay-up. He shouted in Kazuya’s face, chest puffed. “That’s how it’s done.”

Kazuya didn’t flinch. Yuto inbounded the ball to him. He dribbled slowly across half court, scanning the defense.

A quick pass to Yuto. Screen. Pick-and-roll. Yuto slipped inside for a clean layup.

**Score: 15–14.**

On the next possession, Kaito tried to isolate. He shoulder-checked Kazuya and barreled into him.

**Whistle.** “Offensive foul!”

Kaito snapped, “What?! That was clean!”

The ref ignored him. Yuto retrieved the ball, grinning. “He’s rattled.”

Middle school. Tokyo. Kazuya and Kibe on the blacktop, surrounded by cracked concrete and louder voices.

“Your jumper’s broken,” Kazuya had teased once. Kibe missed three shots straight after that.

It was never about power. It was always about pressure.

And pressure breaks rhythm.

Kazuya handled the inbound. Kaito pressed again. Kazuya faked left, spun right, sent a bounce pass between two defenders to Yuto.

**Score: 16–14.**

Kaito stormed back down, clearly trying to answer. Another aggressive drive.

**Whistle. Offensive foul. Number 9.**

Second foul.

Kaito was fuming now. His teammate tried to calm him. The crowd murmured—momentum was shifting.

Kazuya didn’t need to say a word.

He dribbled at the top of the key, watching Kaito bite on every feint. A no-look pass to Yuto again, who scored on a reverse layup.

**Score: 17–14.**

Kaito tried to return fire. Drove hard, went for a spin move—Kazuya timed it and poked the ball loose.

Scramble. Kazuya recovered. Transition play.

He faked a lay-up, drew the defender, kicked out to Yuto on the wing.

**Three-point shot. Two points. Score: 19–14.**

Crowd exploded.

Kaito’s fury boiled over. He charged again.

**Reach-in foul. Third.**

Now the crowd was jeering him.

Next possession. Yuto missed a shot. Kaito’s teammate scored on a mid-range jumper.

**Score: 19–15.**

Then Kaito hit a contested three from the corner.

**Score: 19–17.**

Yuto answered with a two-point drive.

**Score: 20–17.**

Kaito again—step-back jumper, two points.

**Score: 20–19.**

Kazuya drew a foul, hit a free throw equivalent (1 point).

**Score: 21–19.**

Kaito’s teammate tied it.

**Score: 21–21.**

The crowd buzzed with anticipation.

Yuto caught the rebound on defense. They reset.

Kazuya walked to the top of the key.

Yuto approached for a screen.

Kazuya raised a hand. “Clear out.”

Yuto hesitated.

Kazuya didn’t look at him, but his voice was solid. “Trust me.”

Yuto nodded once and stepped back.

The court hushed. Even the wind paused.

*No more running.*  
*Not from eyes, not from expectations. Not from myself.*

He dribbled once. Twice. Crossover. Step back.

**He pulled up. From the logo.**

And just as the ball left his hands—he turned his head away.

He didn’t need to look.

**Swish.**

Game.

The crowd didn’t cheer right away. It was too fast. Too final. The silence hit first.

Then came the roar.

Yuto sprinted forward, grabbing Kazuya by the shoulders. “THAT WAS SICK!”

Kazuya, breathless, let out a small, stunned laugh. “I don’t even know how I did that.”

Naomi leaned in and whispered, “Rei… he *looked away.*”

Reina’s lips parted slightly, *He really did it. I thought he was just… that quiet, odd guy. But now... he’s lit up. Like someone who remembered how to breathe.*  
*Why does it make my chest feel weird to see him smile like that?* A flush of something unfamiliar crossing her face. She didn’t respond.

From the top floor window of the library, Elsa’s fingers tightened around the metal railing.

*Calculated. Timed. Executed with zero hesitation. That’s not luck. That’s intention.*

*He’s dangerous.*

Yet a part of her wasn’t alarmed. A part of her was intrigued. *No... you’re not just a ghost anymore, Kinoshita.*

Possibly autistic/ADHD burn out (I'm not sure but when I hear about it I feel like it fits). I don't want to be around anyone. I don't have any patience whatsoever for those around me and I'm horrible to be around. I don't want to talk to anyone or hear their sounds or smell their smells. I don't want to worry that my resting bitch face offense anyone. I just want to be left alone.    
     
I try to treat myself or do things to help my mood and it it always ends up in disappointment. Like I'll plan a little treat like a coffee or donut or whatever and the shop will be closed unexpectedly or the line for coffee way too long than what I have time for or even if I order ahead they take way longer than expected and risks making me late and makes me even more stressed than before. Or my mom will be planning to take the kids but someone gets sick or something comes up and she can't do it.

My kids summers are *long*. 13 weeks long. I signed my youngest up for a couple of weeks of summer day camp to help myself recharge. But he's at the end of his second week and I am not recharged. I ended up more stressed trying to get him ready for camp, dropped off, picked up, dealing with issues he had there or dealing with him losing things. And things popped up that fell entirely on me to bear the mental load of. Every day I had to appointments to drive to,.places my teen wanted me to take her to. The house always needing something cleaned or put away. Even my fucking fish is suddenly very ill and I'm struggling to find the cauS and get him feeling better.

He's been taking his hobbies more seriously and seems fine with me doing everything to get so son ready in the mornings and ready for bed.   
     
I needed to get a hotel just for me and I didn't. I don't just need quiet at home. I need to be by myself in a hotel room I don't have to clean.

Alright, let's talk about some misconceptions that most Christians still believe, which are actually pretty easy to debunk once you look into the historical and scriptural evidence. Grab your coffee, because you might need it after reading this.


>Paul Was One of Jesus’s Original Disciples

False. Let’s set the record straight here:
Paul was not one of Jesus’s 12 disciples. In fact, he was persecuting Christians before he had his “vision” of Jesus years after Jesus’s death.

 “I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.”  Paul, Galatians 1:13



But somehow, this guy became the main theologian for Christianity? And suddenly, his letters became the foundation for almost all of Christian doctrine. The original disciples? Yeah, they weren’t exactly thrilled about this guy coming in and rewriting the rules after literally hunting them down.

 “When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him.”  Acts 9:26




 >The Trinity Was Taught by Jesus

 Jesus never talked about the Trinity. Not once.
The Trinity as a concept didn’t even exist until the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. So, this was a man-made doctrine centuries after Jesus’s time. Jesus, in fact, was a devout Jew, and he never once claimed to be part of a divine triune godhead.

 “The Father is greater than I.”  John 14:28



>The Bible Has Always Been One Book

Would you believe me if I said that the Bible wasn’t even a thing for the first few centuries?
In fact, there were all kinds of writings in the early Christian world, and many of them didn’t make the cut. The official “Bible” wasn’t finalized until the 4th century. So much for it being the word of God since the beginning of time, huh?



>Jesus Came to Abolish the Law (Torah)

If you’ve heard this one, it’s time for a reality check. Jesus never said he came to abolish the law. In fact, he says the opposite:

 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets… I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.”  Matthew 5:17

It was actually Paul who introduced the idea that the law no longer applied to Gentiles. So, why are Christians following Paul’s doctrine instead of Jesus’s actual teachings?


>The Gospels Are 100% Eyewitness Accounts

I get it. Most Christians think the Gospels are direct eyewitness accounts of Jesus’s life. They’re not.
Mark was a companion of Peter, but he never personally witnessed Jesus.
Matthew and John? Both written decades after Jesus’s death by people who weren’t necessarily there during His lifetime.
Luke? He explicitly says he wasn’t an eyewitness, but rather compiled accounts.


>Christmas and Easter Are Biblical Holidays

Want to guess where Christmas (Dec 25) and Easter come from? Pagan festivals. That’s right.
Christmas was borrowed from the Roman festival of Sol Invictus, and Easter comes from Ēostre, a pagan goddess of spring. Yet somehow, these became Christian holidays centuries after Jesus’s death.
Jesus never celebrated Christmas. He didn’t even mention Easter.


>The Doctrine of Original Sin Comes from Jesus

Surprise! Original sin was invented by Paul and Augustine, not Jesus. Jesus never said that babies are born sinful. In fact, He praised children and said the Kingdom of God belongs to them (Matthew 18:3). So, why are Christians still holding onto this concept of inherent sin when Jesus never said a word about it?



> Salvation Is by Faith Alone

This is a Paulism again. Jesus never said that faith alone would save you. He preached about obedience, good works, and repentance:

 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.” — Matthew 7:21



But somehow, Paul’s interpretation of faith ended up being the golden rule. Where’s the logic in that?



>The Bible is Perfectly Preserved

Wrong again. There are thousands of manuscript differences in the Bible. Some of the books we consider “holy” were added later (like the Book of Enoch), and many verses were altered (like the ending of Mark 16:9–20). The Bible we read today is not the same as the one early Christians used.



So why are Christians so eager to follow teachings that aren’t even from Jesus, and doctrines that weren’t even finalized until centuries after His death? We’ve got Paul’s personal revelations, misunderstood gospel teachings, and a ton of later-invented traditions that have come to define the faith. And at the end of the day, we’re all left wondering is it still the original message of Jesus, or just a game of spiritual telephone?

 If the foundation of Christianity is based on Paul’s letters, why should we trust a man who never met Jesus, persecuted His followers, and reinterpreted everything about Jesus’s message just because he had a vision?

1lxe13p,https://v.redd.it/hs3d2m30dacf1,What Are the Best Practices for Managing Remote Teams?,"Proven Strategies to Keep Distributed Teams Aligned and Engaged

📦 Framing the Question
Remote work is no longer a novelty — it’s a norm. But managing remote teams demands more than just Zoom calls and Slack channels. The best practices for managing remote teams balance trust, accountability, and clear communication. This guide breaks down practical strategies to lead dispersed teams effectively, boost productivity, and keep people connected, wherever they log in from.

Why Remote Team Management Matters More Than Ever

In the past decade, remote work has shifted from perk to necessity. Today’s managers face a crucial challenge: keeping teams productive and cohesive without the daily buzz of an office. Done right, remote work unlocks talent and flexibility. Done poorly, it drains morale and results.

The keyword here is alignment. A well-managed remote team knows what to do, why it matters, and how to get it done together — even when working apart.

1. Communicate Clearly — and Often

In remote teams, silence isn’t golden — it’s confusing. Leaders must intentionally replace the informal desk chats and hallway catch-ups that happen naturally in offices.

Best practices:

Set expectations for how, when, and where your team communicates.
Use multiple channels — email for formal updates, chat for quick questions, video for complex discussions.
Have regular check-ins: daily standups, weekly one-on-ones, and team meetings.
Share meeting notes to keep everyone aligned, even if they miss a call.
Think of communication like watering a plant — consistent care keeps it alive and thriving.

2. Build Trust Through Autonomy and Accountability

Micromanagement is toxic in any workplace — but for remote teams, it’s a disaster. Instead, focus on building trust:

Clarify roles, goals, and deadlines.
Measure output, not hours online.
Celebrate wins publicly and address issues privately.
Empower people to own their work and decision-making.
A real-world example: tech company GitLab — which is fully remote — uses detailed documentation, clear KPIs, and open channels to make sure everyone knows what to do. This culture of trust makes them a case study in remote success.

3. Make Time for Human Connection

Working remotely can be lonely. To keep teams connected:

Schedule virtual coffee breaks or social calls.
Celebrate birthdays and milestones together, even virtually.
Use tools like Donut on Slack to randomly pair teammates for casual chats.
Encourage sharing non-work updates to maintain camaraderie.
A team that knows each other as people, not just co-workers, collaborates better.

4. Use the Right Tools

Remote work thrives on the right tech stack. Invest in reliable tools for:

Communication: Slack, Microsoft Teams
Collaboration: Google Workspace, Notion
Project Management: Asana, Trello, Jira
Video Conferencing: Zoom, Google Meet
Don’t overwhelm the team with too many tools — keep it simple, integrate where possible, and train people to use them well.

5. Be Flexible — But Set Boundaries

One benefit of remote work is flexibility, but it can blur lines between work and life.

Encourage clear work hours.
Respect time zones.
Don’t expect 24/7 availability.
Lead by example: sign off when you’re off.
This prevents burnout and keeps people engaged for the long haul.

6. Provide Opportunities for Growth

Remote employees want development, too. Managers should:

Offer training and upskilling.
Support mentorship and coaching.
Give regular feedback and career path discussions.
Investing in your people shows you care about more than just deliverables — it builds loyalty and retention.

7. Keep Improving Your Remote Culture

Remote work isn’t static. Regularly check in on what’s working and what’s not:

Run anonymous surveys.
Hold retrospectives to improve processes.
Be open to new ideas and tools.
Your team’s needs will evolve — your approach should, too.

Summary: Build Connection, Clarity, and Trust

Managing remote teams isn’t about recreating the office online — it’s about designing new ways to work better, together. Clear communication, trust, connection, and the right tools are your foundation. Keep learning and adjusting, and your team will thrive wherever they plug in.

Please read: I really need advice. 

My boyfriend (25m) and I (25F) have been in a relationship for 2 years. We’ve loved each other very deeply and have always supported each other through our highs and lows. We lived together (shared a room in a 5b2b) during our last semester to save some money. The goal was to live together till the end of the year because we assumed upon graduating our jobs would take us elsewhere, but he ended up taking a few months to get a job, so we lived together for an extra 6 months 

Throughout the time we’ve been together, we’ve done a lot for each other out of love but I often felt like I was the one giving more. I learnt to cook for him, always do my part trying to surprise him or get him cute things when he’s feeling low. He’s a big foodie, so food has always been a central part of his life (and because of it, mine). But this also means I’ve had to deal with many tantrums because he’s extremely picky (he doesn’t eat food older than a day, smells something thoroughly to check if it’s good before putting it in his mouth, even if I cooked it). When it was his last day for school I cooked him his favorite meal which took me almost 2 hours. But he never even remembered mine. 

I recently celebrated my 25th birthday. I’m not a birthday person at all, I haven’t celebrated my birthday since I was 17, but this was my 25th so I wanted to do something special. Luckily it fell on a long weekend, so it was a great opportunity to make something awesome out of it. I had been telling him since at least 3 months that for the first time in my life, I’m kinda excited for my birthday. I told him I would throw a party for my friends and invite everyone over, but that I also wanted him to plan a birthday weekend since it was falling on this long weekend of 4 days. Mind you, I don’t like grand gestures: expensive gifts, trips or anything of that sort. At this point he was unemployed and I never wanted him to spend a lot of money on me, totally understand the place he was coming from so I told him I wanted to do one small thing everyday over  the birthday weekend like pottery, go to the beach, a picnic in the park etc.  On the weeks leading up to it he really increased my hopes because he always portrayed himself as the best date planner. He said he was going to get me 25 gifts for my 25th, plan a surprise party with my best friend, take me on a short day trip etc and I was very excited. And because he said he had a lot of this in mind, I never went ahead and planned anything for myself. 

A bit of context: Over the past 2 years I’ve always gone above and beyond for his birthday. This year, I took him on a weekend getaway to NYC to help him refresh and reset through his stressful period of job search, and NYC isn’t cheap. The year before that I surprised him when he got back from class by blowing up balloons and decorating him room with a lovely happy birthday banner, I also took him snowboarding that weekend which was booked weeks in advance. In return, took me on a brunch and mini golfing once but that was about it. 

The Friday of my birthday weekend (which was a holiday) I waited all morning for him to share his plans with me. I had expectations: he’s going to take me on coffee dates, make me a good meal, plan a picnic, take me to the zoo: simple things. I waited till 2 pm but he didn’t share anything. Then my best friend called me and we spoke for a couple of hours. After the call I got too impatient and finally asked what he had in mind. He said that he completely forgot it was a holiday that day and asked if I wanted to do something. He blamed it all on my phone call because it took hours and he ‘never had the chance to do anything’. 
I was stunned and disappointed, but I tried to salvage it and suggested a trip to the beach.. At this point it was around 4 and it had started to get a bit chilly. I was very upset that he didn’t even remember it was my birthday weekend and got very quiet on the way to the beach. In response to it he got angrier that I was getting upset and not having a fun time. I tried to let it go but he started to sulk, which made me sulk even more. We walked on the beach and I was really upset and lost in thought: I turned around looking for him but he was at least half a mile behind me sitting on a park bench, sulking. I stood by the water for about 10 minutes in tears when he finally walked up to me and asked how long I was going to put up with this drama. He yelled at me for ‘always getting too explosive’ and ‘letting the emotions get the best of me’. I cried hysterically on the way back home which made him even madder. When we reached him, I went to the kitchen to get some water and he walked out of the apartment without a word, slamming the door behind him. 

I had no idea where he went or when he was returning and was getting very hurt by his actions. He didn’t show up for hours and I cried the entire time. How could he forget this? How could he be mad at me for being upset? If he didn’t want to plan anything for me, he could just let me know. But his response to it was that my birthday was on Monday and I was getting upset without a reason. 

When he finally showed up my eyes were swollen from all the crying. He gave me a box of Swarovski diamond earrings and a necklace with a grumpy face and asked, “does this make you happy?”  At that point it felt like he gave me this to shut me up. I tried the earrings on and put them aside. When he noticed that I was still pretty upset, he gave up and started playing his PS4. After a couple of hours he asked me if I wanted to go to this hiking area. His plan? A hiking spot 4 hours away by bus, requiring 5 transfers, just to hike for 2 hours and come back the same way. I told him that didn’t sound fun or doable and I didn’t want to spend 8+ hours traveling in a day. When I said that he got very annoyed and said “what else can I do to make you happy. Don’t you understand I’m under a lot of pressure from this job hunt now will you stop with the drama”

I was heartbroken and couldn’t stop crying. The birthday weekend is ruined because of this. I always tried to go above and beyond my means to make him happy. It turns out he never had any plans for my bday weekend from the beginning. I never wanted diamond earrings or an expensive gift (at that point he owed me almost $8k USD so obviously he wasn’t doing very well financially), I just wanted him to plan small things to do everyday of the weekend. I ended up planning the rest of the weekend myself. I made reservations for rock climbing the next day and invited my friends over the day after that. I planned a brunch and went out for a picnic because I didn’t want to ruin my birthday. To this day he keeps insisting that he planned the rock climbing, the picnics, the brunch because it was ‘his idea’ but he never picked up the phone to make reservations or made a concrete plan out of it, and makes me feel like a bitch whenever I say I planned everything out myself. 

Even months later, he keeps bringing up my “birthday meltdown” during arguments. It’s become a running joke between him and his friends, and they laugh about how dramatic I was. He told them a very watered-down version of the story that makes me look crazy and oversensitive, and now I feel like they all have this impression of me as being ungrateful and overemotional. 

This is a very recurring thing, where he pushes me to the breaking point and makes me feel bad about breaking down. Whenever I bring this up with him, he starts counting all the things he’s done for me: listened to me when I cried, lifted my heavy bags and boxes when I was moving out, cooked meals for me when we started to date, handled my ‘breakdowns’ but I think all this is less than the bare minimum. Plus all of this happened more than a year ago. I haven’t shared any of this with my friends because I don’t want to make him look bad. But the truth is, I feel so unseen and hurt. I cry whenever I think about that weekend. I gave him the benefit of the doubt for so long, went above and beyond for his happiness, and when I asked for something small and simple, I got guilt-tripped and gaslit.

So… AITA for crying and “overreacting” when my boyfriend didn’t plan anything, after promising he would for months? Or am I right to feel like I was let down in a major way? Am I being emotionally manipulated or abused? ",3,1752257373.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False
1lxdzzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1lxdzzh/i_left_her_because_she_was_very_manipulative_and/,I left her because she was very manipulative and lying constantly….,"I’ve caught her (38f)so many times lying and when she gets caught, she still won’t apologize or admit to her lying. It became so difficult to trust her. She is a bartender so I know she’s constantly being hit on and flirting with guy. She loves male attention, and so I just wouldn’t go to see her too often. Plus I’m pretty sure she had something going on with a coworker and it would just eat me up when I was there. This said coworker offered her coke when she first started and was hitting on her a lot and I was always told there’s no way… He’s a loser pretty much. Still didn’t sit right with me.

She also has a lot of guy friends that she keeps around because they all want to fuck her… and she has fucked her friends I know for a fact (and probably has hookups in secret). I didn’t like her talking with other dudes and found it disrespectful to me that she would act like that and so I was labeled as controlling. I didn’t control her and told her if that’s what she wants then go ahead I won’t be around, but she always assured me she wanted to be together forever. 

We started fighting alot and I hated it. She’d sleep all damn day then get mad at me for playing on my phone enjoying my coffee in the mornings. I would try and wake her up to cuddle, to be productive like housework or just go do something but she slept until 2pm a lot, wake up and start yelling at her cats, dog or me. It was horrible. 

I did a couple weeks in county so I would have to do a year of probation and put strain on our relationship because I didn’t want to have to ask her to quit smoking and drinking with me so I did jail time. 2 weeks and shit and thought it might be a good test to see if we can be apart that long… well I told her to pick me up at a certain time so I could go get a hair cut and beard trim, buy her flowers and some presents. She picks me up and barely kisses me and told me I shouldn’t have bought her flowers… I also told her the night before to shower so we could go at it like animals. (If she did cheat I was gonna make sure she washed up) But she didn’t shower and we didn’t even have sex for like a week. I knew she cheated on me. Even caught her lying about her whereabouts while I was in. 

From there it just got worse and worse and sex got less and less…. I only had my dick sucked 5 times in the year and a half we were together and I let it be known. I’ve never had to ask for hear and usually am having a lot of sex with whomever I’m with…. Not the case with her and I just had a gut feeling something was off.

I used to have access to her lock screen on her phone but I caught her lying and she changed everything and would never let me see her phone again. If I would have known about snap and telegram when I did go through it I’m sure I would have found a lot more…. But they day I left her she left her phone open and was texting that dude from work. I scrolled through just skimming messages and they were texting on the reg. Everyday which I looked at her said “fuck you”, tossed her phone behind me and walked out. She blew my phone up for hours wanting to talk it out, saying “he’s like a brother to me…” you’ve only known him a year and he was constantly hitting on you. Sounds like a brother to me. 

We split in Nov but stayed talking for 3 months off and on but never doing anything and new years she lied to me again. Said she wasn’t doing anything but going home after she made a run to her other restaurant she works for… I wanted to surprise her with a joint at midnight and spend the new years with her but she didn’t come home until 2. Her lying continued and I finally had enough and said we are never getting back together.

One night at 2am she texts me about my military paperwork and she’s going through it talking shit to me saying I’m stealing money from other vets. Talking shit she knows nothing about…. I told her to give me my paperwork and she can have her phone back because I was still on her plan and we never have to talk to each other again. She still has stuff of mine I never was able to get back because everytime I went there she’d go crazy and start getting physical so I’d have to get away. Well I brought the cops to her house to get my paperwork because she has tried baiting me many times to hit her. The second time I brought the cops she said she wasn’t home (another lie) and would be dropping the paperwork off at the police station and then filing a restraining order on me. The cop even said she has nothing… well she lied and has friends on the police force so the judge upheld it. But gave her a restraining order as well. The evidence she turned in had nothing to do with anything recent and never showed any evidence of abuse. My mom and brother was witnesses to her abuse but couldn’t be there to defend me at the hearing so I looked unhinged. 

It’s been since February and at first I was so pissed and angry at her for doing this shady shit to me but I since then have been missing her fiercely. I loved her with all my heart and still want to be with her. She didn’t even know my eye color when we broke up…. 

Yet I was the narcissist and the abuser… she knows I wasn’t and she was very emotionally abusive and neglectful. She was mean and manipulative. A liar and a cheater…. Me I’m just a fool that was madly in love. 

I haven’t handled it the best and have been very depressed and spiteful. I wish no ill will towards her but I wanted to fuck her friends because those are the type of friends she keeps around… Hoe ass hoes and birds of a feather…. But I still have hope she would change but have recently found out that she filed a report against me for trying to contact her and tell her how much I miss her and think about her constantly. Her cop friend is the one that told me she filed a report while at the same time putting her pussy right on my knee and trying to feel me up. Even the dude she was with was asking me what’s up with her and I and I promised him absolutely nothing. I find her repulsive and a huge hoe and not at all attractive. 

Needless to say I’m looking at jail time for simply telling her I miss her and would like to talk. Yes I’ve tried any platform I could to get through to her but only send a message or two a week for the past 3 weeks. Can’t no more and hate the fact that she would have me thrown in jail for just telling her I miss her and think about her constantly. 

Fuck her. She’s evil and I think her friends are starting to realize it because they’ve been telling me how much they know she’s a psycho… I’ll still do jail time I think and I don’t know what to do. I’m moving on but that’s wrong on so many levels",1,1752257365.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Literally any different perspectives would be appreciated—I apologise preemptively for the wall of text (feel free to skim 😅).

They’ve been in treatment, including DBT, before. Without wanting to force a label on it, their BPD seemed to be more “quiet”/internalised—they struggled with a lot of guilt, shame, and self-destructive behaviours. But they never blew up at me, accused me of anything, … nothing like that. 

It was definitely turbulent from the start—getting used to all of their ups and downs—but it was the happiest I’d felt in a very long time, beginning to end. I really cannot overstate how deeply I loved this person, and how much being with them changed me. I opened up to them in ways I never thought possible, and I felt they did the same with me. 

Yet things got more difficult as time went on and I struggled to put my full trust in them. They were just so inconsistent sometimes. Showering me with love, then suddenly being distant. Not replying to texts for hours on end. Showing up late or not at all for plans we made. Not really listening or remembering things that mattered to me. 

I just didn’t feel like a priority. Like I was separate from the rest of their life. They would say they’d give up anything else for me—their friends, their hobbies, their music. I never would’ve asked them to but when it came down to it, they always seemed to follow their own whims. It made it difficult to trust that they genuinely cared about and wanted to be with me, even though they said I made them so much happier. 

At first I would still address these things, telling them when they did or said something that made me feel insecure. But it was 50/50 on how that would go: they were really understanding sometimes, and would explain to me what was going through their mind. Even if I couldn’t fully empathise, it still helped to hear. They said they had a lot of anxiety around not living up to my expectations. Like they’d feel they didn’t have anything worthwhile to say over text, so they’d get scared to text me at all. They had this mentality that if they couldn’t somehow do everything exactly right for me, then it would all be completely wrong. Sad but at least it felt like something we could work through together. 

But then just as often, if I would try to enforce a boundary or raise even a minor issue, they would completely spiral into guilt and shame. Saying they were an awful person, they hurt everyone, they deserve to be punished. And I’d be the one to comfort them and just drop the subject. 

I didn’t want to see them hurting like that and it was taxing for me as well, so at some point I think I just stopped… speaking up. If they did or said something that hurt me, I’d convince myself it wasn’t that big of a deal. Really I was just letting things pile up and fester until sooner or later the moment came where they’d mess up somehow, and it would all come out of me—and be a complete shock to them. They took it to mean that while they’d thought everything was going great between us, I’d just been quietly miserable the whole time without enough trust to confide in them. This played out similarly three times while we were together. 

The final instance: we had a trip booked to visit my family abroad in April. It wasn’t the first time we’d traveled together and we’d stayed with their family plenty of times. But they were anxious about being around each other for so long. They worried that if they spiralled for whatever reason, they would end up hurting me again. While I appreciated them opening up, they did just kind of let me sit with that. It put me on edge too. 

I ended up spending the whole trip trying to make everything right for them, so nothing could possibly destabilise them. That wasn’t my responsibility, they didn’t ask me to, and obviously it didn’t work. For the most part, they were super affectionate towards me and even said it was the best holiday of their whole life. Still, there were moments outside my control that led to them being irritated or completely shutting down, without wanting to tell me if it was something I’d done. 

It just felt like I was giving my all and it still wasn’t enough. I was way too sensitive and I’m really ashamed of how that went. I was the one who kind of shut down over the final two days. I was just so tired and emotional and they couldn’t understand why. We had this pointless argument about how I felt like I was always going along with anything they wanted, and they didn’t seem to care or think about me as much. 

But once we got back from the trip, things seemed back to normal. I did have a lot on my mind that I needed to process—I knew things needed to change. That we needed to communicate differently, and I couldn’t keep trying to take responsibility for their emotions. 

A week after we got back, they visited me for just a few minutes despite being very busy—basically begged to see me, brought me flowers and a drink from our favourite coffee shop. Really sweet. 

Then I didn’t hear from them for a few days. When they came back, they sat me down and told me it was over. They said they’d hurt me too much and might never be good enough for me. They said it didn’t feel worth trying anymore and they were ready to give up. That talking to other people had made them realise things between us had been unhealthy from the start, that emotionally our relationship had always been triggering for them and was just a repetition of patterns from their past relationships. That our insecurities didn’t mix. 

It didn’t matter how I tried to reason, they just stared at me while I cried. Then they proclaimed everything had been said between us and walked out. I sent them two messages afterwards, from pleading, to trying to empathise, to asking for any sort of actual closure. They never replied. 

Instead, they‘ve been posting on social media about how much everything in their life has been improving, that they love their friends, throwing themselves into music with their band—even shared a video they originally sent to me when we first met, them playing a song from my favourite film, in a “music dump”. Like I never existed. 

I did send them a third message after about a month of no contact which I regret, mostly about how much I miss them and don’t understand what happened, but I also said that I hope they feel awful for how they ended things. I apologised within minutes of sending it because I felt that way for all of a couple hours—I don’t actually want them to suffer just because I’m suffering. But they texted back “I do care, a lot” and then blocked me. 

So yeah, it’s been over two months now and obviously I’ll never get the answers I want. On a logical level, I know all I can do is take it at face value and move on with my life like they are moving on with theirs. And I’m trying. 

But I miss them terribly and all the uncertainty hurts like hell. I know they feel an almost unbearable amount of shame about how past friendships and relationships of theirs ended. There’s a good chance that “turning it all black” in their mind was the only way they could cope, because dealing with the complexity of the situation and their emotions (and mine) felt impossible. But that doesn’t make it sting less, to feel like it was so easy for them to discard me. 

Has anyone here lived through something similar? Or can maybe help me make some sense of what could be going through their head? Thanks for reading. ",1,1752257268.0,BPDPartners,0,1.0,False

He asked me out pretty much right away after we matched, and while I said yes I asked if we could have a phone call first just to get a feel for him. We ended up talking for over an hour, and I thought he seemed normal and nice, so I felt okay moving forward.

After the call, though, his texting dropped off. He only messaged maybe once a day to check in, and then yesterday just to ask for my address so he could pick me up we had planned to go for a walk. That threw me off a bit. I wasn’t sure if he was actually interested or not.. But then again, he lives in the next city and drove 2.5 hours to meet me, so that effort said something too.

When we met, it was a bit awkward at first — I’m really shy and introverted, and I think he might be the same. We had a few moments of silence where neither of us really knew what to say, but he did most of the talking and kept the conversation going, which I appreciated. We ended up spending about 4 hours together. He shared some really interesting things about his travels and hobbies. I liked listening to him even though we don’t really share the same interests. I also talked a bit but I’m very shy. I need to work on that.

Eventually he suggested going to a small coffee place nearby and he paid for everything, which was sweet. We stayed there for a while and then he drove me back home. On the way, he told me he enjoyed the date and said maybe next time I could visit him in his town — he said he’d like to see me again. I said I’d be open to that.

Now I’m just… waiting to see what happens. I don’t have butterflies, though. Not in the way I’ve had with other guys. But then again, with those guys, the connection was intense and looking back, many of them just wanted to sleep with me. So maybe this slow, quiet, respectful vibe is actually a good sign?

Still, part of me worries I came off as boring because I’m so reserved. He even asked if I’m introverted, and mentioned that he could tell. I wonder if that’s a bad thing?

I guess I’m just not sure if this could go somewhere. It felt calm and kind, but not electric. Has anyone else experienced something like this — where it starts slow and a little quiet, but then turns into something real?

Would love to hear your thoughts.

My bf planned it since he knows how much I love the Cheesecake Factory. I REALLY love their cheesecake (this becomes important later).

Everything was going fine and we were having a good time until an elderly man at the next table scooted his chair out just as our server was approaching, causing him to stumble and spill hot coffee on me (down my back). It was obviously burning and startled me, so I instinctively screamed and pulled my shirt up.

I’m pretty small-chested, so I don’t typically wear a bra, and obviously, I wasn’t thinking about that when something hot was running down my back burning me, so I basically flashed everyone around us. I was embarrassed, but at the same time, it’s just boobs. I pulled my shirt back down right after realizing what happened, but it was up for about 15 seconds. The server apologized over and over, but it wasn’t their fault, it was just an accident.

After this, my bf wanted to leave immediately. He said I was being overdramatic for how I reacted, and maybe I was, but it really startled me and did burn. He told me I “put on a show” for everyone in the restaurant, especially since I screamed when it happened, and that we needed to leave.

I told him it wasn’t that big of a deal and that I really wanted to stay to get cheesecake because it’s my favorite. I even offered to get it to-go, but he was dead set that we needed to leave and didn’t understand why I wasn’t mortified.

We ended up staying, but for the rest of the date, he kept saying that the men at the tables near us were staring at me and probably thinking about me inappropriately, but I said it wasn’t my problem if they’re being gross.

When we got in the car, he told me I ruined our anniversary for making him sit through that and that we should have just left, and that he can’t believe I would choose a piece of cheesecake over his comfortability. We argued in the car the whole way home, and now we haven’t spoken at all today.

1lxdukt,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1lxdukt/after_encouraging_me_to_request_reducing_my_hours/,"After encouraging me to request reducing my hours at work, husband is retracting his support","First time mom with a 10 month old. Throughout our marriage (5 years) I have held down the stable job. Prior job was a necessary evil during the pandemic for insurance in a very toxic work environment. Current job, 2.5 years in, doesn't align with my passions, but it's very stable, pays enough, has good enough benefits, and gets the job done. My husband? Engineer who has worked for various organizations at various levels of pay and risk. In his current role, he has high flexibility in hours, hybrid, casual work culture (often wears shorts and sandals in the office). It is closely aligned with his passions and what he wants to be doing.  Given his credentials and years of experience, he is grossly underpaid. I currently bring in more money than he does, have an HSA, and DCFSA that have been pretty vital benefits as we've grown our family. 

I returned to work when my LO was 12 weeks old. I really struggled (U.S. mom, tale as old as time). For months my LO was sick every week. I am default parent for daycare, doctor, feeding, bathing, bedtime, and so forth. I have sick leave through my employer, but my role is independent. So, while I can take off a day when LO is too sick for daycare, that work has to be made up somewhere. It can be very stressful. I still get teary dropping my child off at daycare. My LO does not sleep well there, so most week day evenings are stressful with an overtired baby. During the work week, I may spend \~2 hours a day with my child. With time, it's become more clear how unhappy I am with our current dynamic. I've sacrificed my career aspirations and passions, my body, and almost all of my personal time for friends, hobbies, etc. for our family. My husband still goes out with friends, grabs coffee or lunch with people during the work day, has hobbies, sits on boards, etc. out of the house multiple evenings per week. 

About 2 months ago, we pulled the numbers and collectively agreed that we could afford me reducing to part time - either with my current employer or find a new opportunity. My husband was completely on board for this, and even said he can look into higher paying opportunities to balance the score. Recently learned my employer will let me go part time - 20 hours per week and I can keep my hourly rate and our health insurance (crunched the numbers, and still cheaper to stay with my employer at part time with an increased premium than switch to my husband's plan). Now that this is a viable, real possibility, my husband is acting cagey and weird about the reduced income. Saying ""this is all for you (me)"" and ""what do I get out of this?"" Worried about the pressures he will feel now that we will rely more on his income. Saying he doesn't get enough time with our child, which is largely on him as he has completely maintained his pre-child social life. Talking about all of the sacrifices HE will have to make in me going part time. This man actually had the balls last night to tell me I am being inconsiderate. I had to take a walk outside. 

I understand that talking about this change versus the change actually happening feel different and scary. I also deeply empathize with the pressures of having the stable job - I've been doing it for years (!) It's too late to change his mind. If he wasn't confident about this decision, I never should've made this request. Too little, too late. He's a dad now and needs to grow up. Starting couples therapy in August.

It was raining, and there was also some thunder. It's weather and dark enough that anything can happen, and the one you'd never tell would do it.

Red decorated restaurant, more retro style. No one's been here. I was sitting on the edge of the room with a perfect view when suddenly someone walked in. He was a young, tall, slender boy who repressed something I could feel inside him and didn't have to look back. With my luck, he sat down an aisle over.

""Everyone who walks in here has a problem, Ethan. Some get resolved and others are left hanging in the air until someone gets it right."" He looked at me with an annoyed look, and the conversation began.

""How do you know me? I've never seen you, and just out of curiosity, I have no problem!"" Throughout the debate then and in the future, I kept a dark face that did not catch his eye.

""Of course you do, everyone does and has. It has to be handled, Ethan. I wouldn't want me to start talking about you instead of the man I'm telling about."" “What story?” He said with a curious tone.

""You know how many people come here. People of any background, style, or religion? Young people come here for fun, to enjoy life. But I once met a guy who shunned everyone. He wasn't like the others; he ended up the worst of all people.""

“Wait, you're comparing me to someone who died?” He said with more indignation than I thought. ""I didn't say it would be you, Ethan. But a human doesn't realize when one is nearing one's end until it's too late, whether it's death or losing oneself.""

I finished, and he began to change. I sat, not speaking for a while. He kept looking at me, and I knew I had guessed him right. He looked around and asked again, “Why was that man avoiding everyone?” I smiled a little and started with a story you don't know yet.

""Ethan, I once knew a different man, but the one thing he had in common with us, he had emotions. He was vulnerable and curious."" Without fully realizing it, he sat down across from me.

""There was a beautiful house next to this restaurant - a larger, white-coloured house with a family that was not the one presented. It had no garden, only woods behind and meadows around, where the sun's rays rarely reached. You can see the path, but I don't know where you would go.""

I digressed for a moment. ""The weather hasn't changed; it was just like it was then. The dark clouds, the sounds of the storm, and the rain, which was just as heavy and resounding as the day it all ended.""

""Would you like a refill?"" A kind, young, shy waitress asked. Ethan looked up quickly and said: ""Yes, please,"" and the waitress poured us an equal volume of coffee to the edge. She left, and he waited tensely.

""The end is near, Ethan...",1,1752256805.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

## ❓ What is a cat cafe?

A cat cafe is a themed cafe where visitors can enjoy drinks or light meals while spending time with resident cats in a comfortable, interactive setting. To learn more about how cat cafes work and what to expect, read our full guide: [What is a Cat Cafe?](https://catcafemap.com/blog/what-is-a-cat-cafe).

---

## 🌏 Where was the first cat cafe?

The world’s first cat cafe opened in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998, called **Cat Flower Garden (貓花園)**. It inspired the cat cafe boom in Japan and beyond. Learn the full history here: [World’s First Cat Cafe](https://catcafemap.com/blog/worlds-first-cat-cafe).

---

## 🐱 Are cat cafes safe for cats?

Most reputable cat cafes prioritize cat welfare with strict hygiene, proper staffing, and enrichment activities to keep cats healthy and happy. They provide cats with safe spaces to retreat, limit visitor numbers to reduce stress, and partner with veterinarians or shelters to ensure proper health care.

However, **some cat cafes have come under criticism**, especially in areas with less regulation. Concerns include:

* **Overcrowding of cats**, leading to stress and territorial disputes.
* **Poor hygiene practices**, risking disease transmission among cats or to humans.
* **Lack of proper staff training**, resulting in rough handling or failure to recognize signs of cat distress.
* In rare cases, reports of cafes **sedating cats to keep them docile**, particularly in regions without animal welfare enforcement.

When visiting a cat cafe, it’s important to observe whether:

* Cats have places to hide or rest away from guests.
* Staff intervene appropriately if cats seem overstimulated.
* The environment is clean, with litter boxes maintained and food/water available.
* The cats appear healthy, relaxed, and free to choose interactions.

Choosing cafes that uphold high welfare standards ensures a safe and enriching experience for both cats and visitors.

---

## 💉 Do they sedate cats at cat cafes?

Most cat cafes do **not** sedate their cats. The cats are awake, playful, and able to choose when they interact with visitors. However, **some less reputable cat cafes, particularly in parts of Asia, have been reported to sedate cats to keep them docile**. Always research reviews and choose cafes that prioritize animal welfare.

---

## 🚫 Are cat cafes illegal?

Cat cafes are legal in many countries, but local health and animal welfare regulations apply. Always check your city or state laws before opening one.

---

## 🏠 Can I take my own cat to a cat cafe?

Most cat cafes do **not** allow outside cats for safety, health, and territory reasons. The resident cats are acclimated to each other and the space, and introducing a new cat could cause stress, territorial disputes, or the spread of illness. **Bringing an unfamiliar cat into the environment can disrupt the established social dynamics among resident cats** and may even pose behavioral or medical risks. Cat cafes are designed for visitors to enjoy the company of the cats already living there, who are carefully selected, health-checked, and supervised to ensure harmonious interactions with guests.

---

## 🌙 What do cat cafes do with cats at night?

At night, cats remain in the cafe or in dedicated sleeping quarters, depending on the cafe's setup. Staff ensure they are fed and comfortable before closing. **Proper cat cafes often have separate rooms or private areas where cats can sleep undisturbed, away from the main cafe space.** These areas provide a quiet, secure environment for rest and can also be used during the day if cats need a break from visitors or become overstimulated. This setup helps maintain their well-being and reduces stress.

---

## 😴 Where do the cats sleep in a cat cafe?

Cats sleep in cozy beds, cat trees, hidden cubbies, or designated off-limits areas where they can rest undisturbed by visitors. **Proper cat cafes also have separate areas aside from the main cafe space** where cats can be moved for sleep, if they become overstimulated, or sometimes for feeding. These areas provide quiet, comfortable environments to ensure cats feel safe, relaxed, and have their basic needs met away from public interaction when necessary.


---

## 🐾 Do cat cafes sell cats?

Some cat cafes partner with local animal shelters or rescue organizations to adopt out cats to visitors. In these cafes, the cats are available for adoption, and staff can assist with the application process if you find a cat you connect with. **These adoption-focused cafes help socialized cats find permanent homes and often rotate in new cats as others are adopted.**

Other cat cafes operate purely as lounges for visitors to interact with cats, offering a relaxing environment without adoption services. **These cafes focus on providing a space for people to enjoy the therapeutic benefits of spending time with cats** but do not rehome them. Always check with the individual cat cafe to see whether they operate as an adoption center, a traditional cafe with resident cats, or a combination of both.

---

## 🗺️ What states have cat cafes?

Many US states now have cat cafes. Browse our [state-by-state cat cafe directory here](https://catcafemap.com/cat-cafes).

---

## 🧼 Are cat cafes sanitary?

Reputable cat cafes follow strict cleaning protocols to ensure both human and cat hygiene standards are met. **They clean and disinfect floors, furniture, litter boxes, and feeding areas daily or multiple times a day, depending on local health regulations.** Food preparation and service areas are usually separated from cat interaction zones to comply with health codes and minimize contamination risks. Staff are trained to maintain cleanliness by promptly removing waste, managing litter boxes hygienically, and ensuring that cats are regularly groomed and checked for health issues. **These measures help create a safe, comfortable environment for both visitors and cats.**

---

## 📝 Do you need a license to have a cat cafe?

Yes, opening a cat cafe typically requires business licenses, health permits, and animal welfare compliance specific to your city and state.

---
## 😿 Are cat cafes stressful for cats?

While new environments can be stressful for cats, most cat cafes design their spaces to minimize stress and promote well-being. **They include hiding spots, elevated perches, and quiet areas where cats can retreat if they want to rest or avoid interaction.** Staff are trained to monitor the cats’ behavior for signs of stress, such as excessive grooming, hiding, or aggression, and will intervene when necessary to protect the cats’ comfort.

Additionally, reputable cafes limit the number of visitors at any given time to prevent overwhelming the cats and ensure that interactions remain calm and positive. **Many cat cafes also establish structured routines for feeding, cleaning, and playtime to provide consistency, which helps reduce anxiety.** Overall, while the cafe environment introduces more human contact than a normal setting, proper management and design keep the resident cats happy, healthy, and relaxed.

---

## 💰 How much does it cost to visit a cat cafe?

Prices vary by location but typically range from **\$10 to \$25 per hour**, often including a drink or snack.

---

## 🐈 How many cats live in a cat cafe?

Most cafes house **5 to 20 cats**, depending on their size, staffing, and local regulations.

---

## 🍽️ Do cat cafes serve food and drinks?

Yes, most cat cafes offer coffee, tea, pastries, and light snacks, with strict health code compliance to separate food preparation areas from cat interaction zones. **This ensures food safety while allowing guests to enjoy refreshments as they spend time with the cats.**

Some cat cafes go beyond basic drinks and snacks. For example, Cafe Surin in Okinawa, Japan provides a full restaurant experience, offering a wide menu of meals alongside their cat lounge, which features two majestic exotic serval cats in a custom-built glass enclosure for guests to observe while dining. **These types of cafes combine a full dining experience with cat companionship**, creating a unique atmosphere for guests who want to enjoy lunch or dinner while watching or playing with cats nearby.

Always check each cafe’s offerings, as some focus primarily on beverages and light bites, while others provide an extensive menu with a full-service kitchen.

---

## 🏢 Who owns cat cafes?

Cat cafes are usually owned by individual entrepreneurs or animal welfare organizations partnering with local shelters for adoption-focused cafes.

I’m a removal tech for a funeral home and got 2 calls in a row starting at 5am and they were tough cases. Then I went to a bagel shop and got charged $30 instead of $6 and the refund didn’t go through for some reason. Then I went to my appointment to get my oil changed. They raised their prices and also found a puncture in one of my tires that’s in a spot they can’t fix so I have to replace it, just as I was starting to accumulate savings in my account.

While I was waiting for my oil change, I went to a coffee shop and immediately spilled my drink all over myself and just had to have it on me for an hour since I didn’t have my car to go home and change. On my way home, I got a nosebleed while I was driving (I get them spontaneously during dry seasons) and realized I’m out of tissues I usually keep stocked in my car.

I crawled back in bed and am going to relax with my favorite show and leftovers of my favorite soup that I made last night.

Here is our IRL products that were created by community members:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport, there is also gonna be running events

Yes this list is insane and yes it was all done by the average holder. Why not use a team? Well people have lives outside of Kendu and over the years they have either gained an incredible and diverse set of skills in their day to day jobs or have done so during hobbies. The set of skills wielded by thousands of people is far more valuable than the set of skills wielded by 25 people. Furthermore after all crypto was all about giving power to the average person, in Kendu, no ones opinion is valued more than anyone else’s. Whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1 everyone is equal. So if you’re on the sidelines I would join, you will fit right in and you will be welcomed into our close knit group immediately!

We are moving out of state and only taking what fits in the van. I have some furniture including 2 nice beds with frames and clean/new mattresses (1 year old.) Also have a sofa, coffee table, some bar stools, kitchen items, etc. Additionally we have a really nice cat tree, some scratchers and a comfy little pet bed. I can't take it with me and I wanted to see if anyone in the community could benefit from it. I would rather give to someone directly rather than send to Goodwill or Donation Warehouse.

I like to read and tested new things. I am looking at a product called Java Burn. Many people are talking about it. I want to understand what it is and share my findings with you. This is a review of Java Burn for 2025.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a powder you can add to your coffee. It has no taste. The powder dissolves in your coffee. People use it to help with weight management. The idea is that it works with your coffee to help your body. It is made with natural ingredients.

# How Does This Powder Work?

The powder has things in it that can help your body burn more calories. This is called a thermogenic reaction. It can help your body turn fat into energy. I read that it can also help you feel less hungry. This may help you eat less. It gives you more energy for your day.

# What Is Inside Java Burn?

I looked at the ingredients in Java Burn. It has some interesting things.

* **Green Tea Extract:** This has antioxidants. It can help your body burn fat.
* **Chlorogenic Acid:** This comes from green coffee beans. It may help your body absorb fewer carbohydrates.
* **L-Carnitine:** This helps move fatty acids to be used for energy.
* **Chromium:** This is a mineral. It can help control blood sugar. This may help with cravings for sweet foods.
* **L-Theanine:** This is found in tea. It can help you feel relaxed without feeling sleepy.
* **Vitamins:** It has some B-vitamins that help with energy.

# Is Java Burn Safe to Use?

Many people who use Java Burn say they do not have any problems. The ingredients are natural. But, because it has caffeine from green tea extract, some people might feel jittery or have trouble sleeping. It is always a good idea to talk to a doctor before you start using any new supplement. Some people have said they had a headache or an upset stomach.

# What Are People Saying About It?

I found many reviews from people who have used Java Burn.

# Good Things People Say

* Many users say they have more energy.
* Some people feel less hungry and have fewer cravings.
* Many have reported losing some weight over time.
* People like that it is easy to use by just adding it to their coffee.

# Not So Good Things People Say

* Some people did not see the results they wanted.
* A few people mentioned they did not like the taste, even though it is supposed to be tasteless.
* It may take some time to see any changes, maybe three to six months.

# My Simple Thoughts on Java Burn

From what I have read, Java Burn seems to be a simple product. It is a powder you can add to your daily coffee. It has natural ingredients that are known to help with metabolism. Many people seem to have good experiences with more energy and some weight loss.

However, it is not a magic powder. It may work differently for different people. Some people see good results, and some do not. It seems to work best when you also have a healthy diet and do some exercise.

If you like to drink coffee and want something to help you with your energy and weight goals, this could be an option to look at. Just remember to be patient and not expect changes overnight. And talking to a doctor first is a very smart thing to do.

1lxdid4,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8n/comments/1lxdid4/day_950_built_a_pdf_report_ai_summary_email_draft/,Day 9/50: Built a PDF Report → AI Summary → Email Draft Automation That Saves 20 Hours/Month,"Hey r/n8n fam! Back with Day 9 of my 50-day AI automation challenge, and today's build was SPICY 🌶️

# The Client Request That Made Me Go ""Hmm... 🤔""

So this morning, I get a message from James (real client, fake name) who runs a digital marketing agency. His problem? Every month, his team gets these massive PDF reports from their ads platform, and someone has to:

* Open each PDF
* Read through 17 pages of data
* Write a summary
* Find the right client email
* Send it out

Dude was literally paying someone to do this for 50+ clients every month. I'm like... bro, let's fix this TODAY.

# What We Built (With Screenshots!)

[\[Screenshot: Full n8n workflow overview\]](https://preview.redd.it/hh6fe2818acf1.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=b385fee8ab6c43ea2b6d3407785a3034c23ecd14)



Here's the magic sauce:

**1. Gmail watches for incoming reports**

* Set up a Gmail trigger that looks for emails from their ads manager
* Auto-downloads any PDF attachments

**2. Extract that PDF like a boss**

* Used n8n's Extract From File node
* Pulls out all 17 pages of text data
* No more manual PDF reading!

[\[Screenshot: PDF extraction showing the text output\]](https://preview.redd.it/jr6k8irf8acf1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=6537c02195b1c0872d94738da48a7819a9d40ac7)



**3. Client matching (this was the tricky part)**

* Extracts client name from the PDF (regex ftw!)
* Looks it up in a Google Sheet database
* Finds the corresponding email address

[\[Screenshot: Google Sheets with client database\]](https://preview.redd.it/rzsx6xal8acf1.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=186338930bbbb94eefae03123f79f351f9240479)



**4. AI Summary Generation with DeepSeek**

* Okay, plot twist - instead of using OpenAI (expensive AF), we used DeepSeek
* 200x cheaper, same quality output
* Generates professional summaries with actual insights

**5. Creates a draft email ready to send**

* To: Correct client email (from database)
* Subject: Professional subject line
* Body: Complete AI summary with metrics, trends, recommendations

[\[Screenshot: Final Gmail draft\]](https://preview.redd.it/ab3yegcv8acf1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d1ec1c9c0a2d65404d48ca81c22ca362917a4e)



# The Output That Blew My Mind 🤯

The AI doesn't just summarize - it actually ANALYZES:

    **Executive Summary**
    - Total Ad Spend: $5,222.40
    - Conversions: 164 (⬇️ 31% MoM on Google)
    - Key Insight: Facebook CPL improved 16% while Google CPA rose 45%
    
    **Recommendations:**
    1. Shift 10% budget from Google to Facebook
    2. Pause underperforming ""lip fillers"" campaign
    3. A/B test new creatives for declining CTR

Like... this is better than what most humans write!

# The Technical Hurdles (keepin' it real)

Not gonna lie, ran into some issues:

1. **Binary data flow in n8n** \- PDFs don't just flow through nodes automatically. Had to use a Code node to split the data stream. Fun times.
2. **DeepSeek integration** \- No native node, so HTTP requests it is! But hey, saved the client $$$ in the long run.
3. **Data references** \- n8n expressions can be finicky. `$json.text` vs `$node[""Whatever""].json.text` \- learned the hard way lol

# Time & Cost Breakdown

* **Build time**: 3 hours (including all the debugging)
* **Cost to client**: $150
* **Monthly savings for client**: \~$500 (no more manual work!)
* **API costs**: <$0.10 per month with DeepSeek

# Key Takeaways

1. **Clients don't always know what's possible** \- Mohit thought this HAD to be manual
2. **DeepSeek is criminally underrated** \- Why pay OpenAI when this exists?
3. **Simple automations = huge impact** \- This saves them 20+ hours monthly

# Want the workflow JSON?

Happy to share if anyone wants to adapt this for their own use. Just promise to use DeepSeek instead of burning money on GPT-4 😅

# What's Next?

Day 10 tomorrow - thinking of building an AI that watches YouTube tutorials and creates written summaries. Any takers?

**Current streak**: 9/50 days ✅  
**Total automations built**: 9  
**Coffee consumed**: 47 cups ☕  
**Clients mind-blown**: 9/9

Edit: Holy shit, front page! Mom, I made it! 😂

Online mainly, but open to transitioning to seeing in person if the vibe is right..","Ya know what they say.. if you keep tryin', somethin' might happen before ya end up dyin'.. So here's to us all continuing to try to find whatever it is we're looking for 🤷‍♂️

Just a blue eyed 5'9 guy here that likes to stay up late and have deep or provocative conversations with a woman I'm into. Unfortunately its hard at moment to have those experiences currently,  since I'm fairly introverted at times and find it hard to think someone has maintained interest in me.. But aside from that ramble here's a little about me(a bit of a read, but I think it covers some important things)

I enjoy staying active and seeing how the weather changes the color of my surroundings.. 

Lately I haven't been so much into gaming as I used to be. Would rather have someone to enjoy the experiences with that I used to enjoy alone. Have a duo partner for a game like Fortnite,  Escape from Tarkov,  Hunt:Showdown, Apex, or PUBG since those are all games I've loved. 

Someone to laugh with and banter with while we both perform terribly at whatever game we are playing because we are too distracted by thinking about what we'll do together when we eventually transition to do something offline..

Or we could just watch something goofy, dark, or exciting together while we have a late night voice chat.

But, I'd like to start things off with something casual, exchange pictures early on so we know we are attracted to each other.. Then we can find a way to hear each other where we are both comfortable so it's easier to establish a vibe.

Chapter 1  
  
Amber Chase arrived at the hilltop mansion breathless, realizing the party had already begun without her.  
  
The doorman looked surprised to see her. ""Miss Chase, what are you doing here? Everyone's already finished dinner...""  
  
Her husband's birthday celebration, yet they'd forgotten to include his wife. Among all the guests from their social circle, not a single person had bothered to notify her.  
  
She smiled at the doorman and was about to push open the door when she overheard a conversation from inside:  
  
""Victoria, what gift did you bring? Blake has been eyeing your gift bag for half the evening.""  
  
""Have I?""  
  
""You haven't even opened it yet, but you've been eyeing that bag so hard you're practically drilling holes in it! Since Victoria's finally back from overseas, you should just dump Amber already. She totally kills the vibe.""  
  
""For real! She drugged you and jumped into your bed. If you hadn't gone all soft and worried about her reputation by making her your wife, she'd be toast by now. Everyone would've ripped her to shreds.""  
  
The man sitting in the center wore a crisp dark suit with the top two buttons of his shirt undone. His features were striking and aggressive, with naturally deep-set eyes, a high nose, and thin lips. Like a brilliantly poisonous butterfly, his slightly upturned eyes carried a distant, aloof arrogance.  
  
""No rush,"" he said coolly.  
  
""Blake, it's been three years and you're still not in a hurry? Back then, she caused Victoria's sister to become a vegetative patient. If your grandmother hadn't protected her, we would have destroyed her long ago.""  
  
Blake Westwood's elegant fingers played with a lighter in his hand as he caught a glimpse of a shadow at the doorway.  
  
Only then did the group notice that Amber had been standing there for who knows how long.  
  
Someone whispered, ""Who invited her?""  
  
No one answered. Clearly, she had come uninvited.  
  
Amber lowered her lashes. She had a delicate, cool beauty with an oval face and wore a light cashmere sweater. Her forehead was framed by hair gently tucked behind her ears. Just looking at that innocent face, nobody would believe she could pull off such shameless stunts, but she definitely did all that stuff.  
  
She clutched a gift in her hands and looked toward Blake sitting at the center. Her chest felt as if it were bound by wire, the pain penetrating deeply, making her fingers clench tightly.  
  
She walked to his side, but before she could offer her carefully prepared gift, she saw him slightly furrow his brow and casually mock her: ""Who invited you?""  
  
Laughter erupted around them, shattering what remained of her pride.  
  
Victoria, standing nearby, gave Blake a reproachful glance before pulling Amber to sit down. ""She's still your wife. It's only right for her to bring you a gift. Amber, sit down. Blake just has a terrible temperament.""  
  
Amber pressed her lips together without speaking. She was his wife, yet needed his ex-fiancée to smooth things over. No one here welcomed her, but she had come anyway, just because when he was eighteen, he had promised they would celebrate his twenty-eighth birthday together.  
  
She deliberately sat next to Blake, displacing Victoria.  
  
Victoria's expression faltered momentarily before becoming somewhat unpleasant. Then she asked, ""What gift did you bring for Blake?""  
  
A mischievous guest immediately opened it, revealing a scarf without tags that appeared handmade.  
  
Victoria's voice rose again, ""Oh my! We must be connected somehow—I also brought Blake a scarf.""  
  
The two scarves now sat side by side, both handmade, with no discernible difference in craftsmanship.  
  
Someone accidentally bumped the table, causing an open bottle of wine to spill toward both scarves.  
  
Blake reached out and took one of them, while the other became soaked with wine and reeked of alcohol.  
  
He had taken Victoria's scarf.  
  
Seeing the scarf she had knitted for two months soaking in wine, Amber's face turned pale for reasons she couldn't explain, her heart feeling both numb and dull.  
  
Victoria sighed, sympathetically linking arms with her. ""Amber, don't be upset. This one can still be used after washing.""  
  
Amber still didn't respond, instead looking toward Blake.  
  
He kept his lashes lowered, hiding the emotions in his eyes.  
  
The atmosphere got super awkward, with Amber basically crashing what was supposed to be a fun celebration. Everyone started making excuses to leave.  
  
She just sat there motionless, staring at the scarf abandoned on the coffee table, discarded just like her.  
  
As others gradually left, she fixed her gaze on Blake, who was also about to stand. ""Blake, happy birthday,"" she said softly.  
  
Blake acted as if he hadn't heard. When he was twenty-one, he had just been reunited with the Westwood family. By then, he was already a self-made business prodigy with nineteen-year-old Amber by his side.  
  
Seven years later, the business prodigy had become a titan at the center of power, but any feelings between them had long since vanished.  
  
Those difficult early days of struggling together in obscurity now seemed like another lifetime.  
  
Blake had Victoria escorted home.  
  
Victoria reached out and lightly touched his shoulder. ""Talk things through with her. Don't keep fighting.""  
  
Someone scoffed quietly, ""Victoria, you're too kind-hearted.""  
  
""I'm not kind-hearted. I just think the young Amber didn't know any better back then. I'm sure she didn't mean it.""  
  
""Bullshit. She ruined someone's life and shamelessly stole your place. How dare she show her face again.""  
  
Their voices were filled with disgust, growing fainter as they left.  
  
Amber sat motionless, as if paralyzed, every drop of blood running cold, her lips losing their color.  
  
She stood up, grabbed the soaked scarf, and looked at Blake.  
  
""Blake.""  
  
Her voice was gentle as she called his name.  
  
Blake had already draped his suit jacket over his arm. Hearing her, he loosened his tie slightly without looking at her, his brow visibly irritated. ""What now?""  
  
She smiled faintly, her beautiful lips forming the words: ""Let's get divorced, Blake.""  
  
Surprise flashed in his eyes, quickly replaced by layered malice in his expression. ""What new game is this? First you drug me to get me to sleep with you, and now you're acting noble and asking for divorce? Aren't you tired of these tactics, Amber?""  
  
""I'm sorry for wasting three years of your life, but I'm serious this time.""  
  
Blake's mocking expression disappeared inch by inch as he yanked her close, his fingers digging into her chin. Seeing her wince in pain somehow eased his unexplainable frustration. ""Now you're talking about wasting time? Where the hell were you three years ago? Listen up, Amber—you want a divorce? Fine! But you won't see a single fucking penny from me!""  
  
""I'll leave with nothing.""  
  
Her eyes were clear, her voice still calm and untainted.  
  
After the Westwoods finally tracked down Blake, they promptly adopted Amber—who'd been by his side—as their goddaughter. Everyone knew exactly what they were doing: the family didn't want their precious second-in-line, the backup heir to the Westwood fortune, marrying some nobody with an ordinary background, so they gave her this goddaughter status to shut people up.  
  
Blake stared at her cool face, his throat working silently as he turned away.  
  
""Fine. Nothing. Don't regret it.""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Outside, rain had begun to fall without anyone noticing. The mansion was on a hilltop in the suburbs, making it difficult to get a taxi.  
  
The others had already left in their cars. Amber, who had arrived by taxi, was now the last one remaining. She stood under the eaves, watching the drizzle.  
  
A black Rolls-Royce cut through the rain and stopped in front of her. The window lowered, revealing Blake's assistant's face—Devon Ward.  
  
""Mrs. Westwood, please get in.""  
  
Amber remained standing, her gaze penetrating the car window crack, seeming to know someone else sat inside.  
  
She didn't speak, and Blake's voice rose from within.  
  
""Drive. Let her cool off out here.""  
  
Devon looked uncomfortable but had no choice. He drove away.  
  
Amber watched the car leave, blinking as raindrops drifted in and landed on her face, their coolness penetrating to her marrow.  
  
At eighteen, Blake had looked forward to celebrating his twenty-eighth birthday with her, but at twenty-eight, he thoroughly despised her.  
  
During these three years, he hadn't touched her once, had barely even come home.  
  
Society gossips said she was the most pitiful among all the women who had married into powerful families. All she had was a beautiful cage and nothing else.  
  
In everyone's eyes, she was the villain who had caused Victoria's sister Sophia to become a vegetative patient and then stolen Victoria's fiancé. She deserved universal contempt.  
  
But no one seemed to remember that from age twelve to nineteen, she had accompanied him from his lowest point to his rise to prominence.  
  
Everyone said the Westwoods had already done her a huge favor with that goddaughter title, but she still wasn't satisfied—using those seven years together to emotionally blackmail Blake for life.  
  
Another seven years had passed. All told, she had been by Blake's side for fourteen years.  
  
She lowered her lashes, staring at the rideshare request on her phone. Still no drivers willing to accept the trip.  
  
By the time she returned to River Haven, it was already two in the morning. Her skirt was soaked, clinging to her ankles. In the deep autumn night, it was so cold her lips trembled slightly.  
  
Lights were still on inside the mansion. As she changed her shoes in the entryway, she saw the man sitting on the sofa handling business documents.  
  
Blake's bone structure was exceptional. No matter how long one looked at him, his appearance remained stunning and captivating.  
  
Sitting there, he resembled an unattainable snow-capped mountain.  
  
Amber certainly didn't think he was waiting for her. Three years ago, they had completely fallen out, and she had transformed from a once-bright young woman into someone who barely recognized the shrew she saw in the mirror.  
  
She quietly changed her shoes, tossed the scarf into the garbage bin by the door, and went upstairs.  
  
The master bedroom contained many of her things, kept clean and cozy, since Blake had rarely returned home in the past three years. Everyone mocked her for living as a married single woman.  
  
She pulled out a small suitcase and packed some of her regularly worn clothes. As for the wall of luxury bags and jewelry, she had never touched them.  
  
Blake had said she wasn't worthy.  
  
In his eyes, she was a gold-digger. Placing luxury items in front of her but forbidding her to use them was his form of torture.  
  
Amber came downstairs with her suitcase and placed the signed divorce agreement on the coffee table.  
  
""Blake, I've signed it.""  
  
During these three years, they fought whenever they met—more accurately, she would unilaterally accuse him of coldness, desperately trying to get his attention like a madwoman. He would stand silently, watching her lose control with a detached, cold indifference.  
  
Blake's gaze shifted from his computer to her suitcase, his throat burning as if someone had poured sulfuric acid down it, scorching from his throat to his stomach.  
  
He sneered, his cold, mocking voice like a sharp knife threatening to pierce her eardrums. ""Bringing this tiny bit of stuff—what, you planning to keep coming back for more every few weeks? Amber, did you forget how you landed this position in the first place? I was engaged to Victoria, and you drugged me at our engagement party, got us caught in bed together, and forced me to marry you.""  
  
""Yeah, that's on me.""  
  
She gripped the handle of her suitcase, her face draining of color, her damp skirt making her appear on the verge of collapse.  
  
Her fingers clenched tightly. After a long silence, she finally spoke hoarsely.  
  
""Blake, I want to know—why did you suddenly stop loving me?""  
  
She had pondered this question many times over the past three years. Back when they huddled together in that cramped apartment, he had said Blake would love Amber forever. Later, after the Westwood family found him, people had warned her to take some money and leave, saying the Westwoods would never accept a daughter-in-law of her background.  
  
She hadn't listened, clinging to his promise, waiting for him to come marry her in grand style.  
  
Instead, she received news of his engagement to Victoria. He said he no longer loved her.  
  
How could he stop loving her so suddenly?  
  
""Because you're not worthy.""  
  
Those words hit her like a hammer blow, making her dizzy.  
  
She couldn't describe the pain. Her heart felt punctured in countless places, bleeding profusely.  
  
When he loved her, he said Amber was the best girl in the world. When he stopped loving her, he casually said she wasn't worthy.  
  
With her ordinary background, she had defended their love in front of those high-society heirs who looked down on her. In their eyes, she was a presumptuous clown.  
  
But she had always thought of herself as a knight, believing his engagement must have been due to unavoidable circumstances.  
  
She had deceived herself for three years. Now it was time to wake up from the dream.  
  
She picked up her suitcase and walked to the entryway. ""Sign it, then. I'll wait for you at the registry office tomorrow at noon.""  
  
After saying this, she changed her shoes, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and smiled. ""Blake, I'm sorry for bothering you all these years.""  
  
Blake's grip on the contract documents trembled with such force that he nearly pierced the paper, then helplessly released them.  
  
""Yes, finally some relief.""  
  
Hearing this, Amber couldn't help but feel hurt. She wanted to smile but found she couldn't.  
  
She could only turn and leave.  
  
Devon was waiting at the door. Seeing her with the suitcase, his face showed conflict. ""Mrs. Westwood, the boss didn't intentionally forget to notify you last night. He...""  
  
Amber dragged her suitcase into the rain, seemingly unwilling to stay a moment longer.  
  
But after a few steps, she stopped and turned to Devon, who still stood at the door. ""The Pine Creek Estate—who is he keeping there? Can you tell me?""  
  
Devon tensed visibly, quickly lowering his head, seemingly surprised she knew about that place.  
  
Seeing his reaction, Amber took a small breath. ""He's been keeping someone there for three years, hasn't he?""  
  
""Mrs. Westwood, I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that.""  
  
How could he not know? He was Blake's closest confidant.  
  
Amber wiped away the gentle rain from her face, her clothes getting soaked. ""It's fine. You don't have to tell me.""  
  
""Mrs. Westwood...""  
  
But Amber had already stepped into the rain.  
  
When she gave Blake her first time at eighteen, she had imagined their future together.  
  
She never expected that at twenty-six, everything would be shattered, and letting him go would feel like carving out half of her flesh and blood.  
  
But she truly didn't want this anymore.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When she arrived at her sister Jordan's house dragging her luggage, Amber felt somewhat embarrassed.  
  
After leaving River Haven, she had brought nothing with her except two hundred dollars in cash.  
  
During her three years of marriage, she had developed severe depression amid constant arguments. Afraid to face people, she had stayed in the mansion perfecting her cooking skills, not caring even when her hands were covered in blood blisters. She still loved Blake and wanted to salvage their precarious relationship.  
  
But the meals had grown cold so many times, and he had never eaten them.  
  
Jordan wasn't her biological sister. They had run away from their village together years ago. Jordan had quickly been adopted by a family and now was married, living with her partner in a modest 700-square-foot apartment with a peaceful, warm life.  
  
Later, Amber met Blake when she was near starvation, and he had tossed her a bread roll. She had shamelessly attached herself to him, working alongside him to earn money.  
  
Amber's body was still dripping wet. She quickly wiped her face and rang the doorbell.  
  
Jordan opened the door in her pajamas, looking surprised. From the bedroom came her husband's impatient voice: ""Who is it?""  
  
Jordan pulled her inside and hurried to the bathroom for a clean towel.  
  
""Amber, why are you here in the middle of the night? You're soaking wet. Did you fight with Blake?""  
  
""Can I stay here tonight, sis?""  
  
""Of course. We have an extra bedroom. It's tiny, but I hope you don't mind.""  
  
Jordan handed her a new pair of pajamas and efficiently prepared the bed.  
  
The bathroom was narrow, barely fitting two people, but it had separate wet and dry areas. The corner was covered with brownish water stains that had never been cleaned away.  
  
She quickly took a shower, too embarrassed to use the hair dryer at this hour, and went straight to the bedroom.  
  
The room was indeed small, with just a five-foot bed and a narrow desk.  
  
She heard her brother-in-law's voice from the master bedroom.  
  
""Who is it?""  
  
""Amber. She probably had a fight with Blake.""  
  
""She's a wealthy socialite wife. What's she doing in our place? Don't you know who Blake Westwood is? I've been working in the lowest ranks of Westwood Industries for three years and haven't even glimpsed him once.""  
  
""Enough, Amber is my sister.""  
  
The whispered conversation stopped.  
  
Amber dabbed at her hair with the towel, wrapped it up turban-style, and simply lay down on the bed.  
  
At seven in the morning, the kitchen already echoed with the sounds of breakfast being prepared.  
  
Her hair had dried naturally overnight, but she had a headache and forced herself to get up.  
  
The table was set with five small dishes. Her brother-in-law, Mark Quinn, was setting out plates and noticed her approach. ""Amber, come sit! I bought fish early this morning and had your sister make fish soup.""  
  
They were both working professionals who normally made do with a few slices of bread for breakfast. They had prepared this spread especially for Amber's visit.  
  
Jordan brought over three plates of scrambled eggs and toast, smiling at her. ""Dig in.""  
  
Amber's skin was luminously pale. Since clinging to Blake's side from the age of twelve, he had never mistreated her.  
  
During those impressionable years, she thought it was love, never suspecting he merely saw her as a sister.  
  
She lowered her lashes, her face pained from the headache.  
  
Mark enthusiastically pushed a plate of ribs toward her. ""Jordan got up at five to cook. Hey Amber, did you know I work at Westwood Industries? My supervisor is such a bootlicker, yesterday he made a girl in our department cry. Word is he got in through connections and has cut my salary twice already. Could you maybe put in a word with Blake for me?""  
  
Jordan glared at him, but Mark just smiled.  
  
She quickly ladled some fish soup for Amber. ""You look unwell, and you got rained on last night. Have some soup to warm up, and don't listen to him.""  
  
Amber looked up, her pale face bearing an unhealthy flush. ""I'm sorry, Mark, but Blake and I are getting divorced.""  
  
This statement was met with several seconds of silence at the table.  
  
Mark's surprise flashed briefly across his face before he asked, ""So he's giving you half his fortune? Amber, even though he paid for your education at the best university, you married him right after graduation, right? You've never actually worked, so you probably don't know how to manage money. I'm concerned someone might take advantage of you with all that money.""  
  
""Mark!"" Jordan reprimanded sharply.  
  
Finally, Mark fell silent and took a bite of food.  
  
Jordan had known Amber since childhood. They had journeyed to NY together, like two raindrops merging into a vast sea, where survival itself was a challenge. She got adopted, while Amber bounced from job to job with Blake. Thankfully, Blake treated her decently, working himself to exhaustion to put her through school.  
  
She took a deep breath. ""Just keep your money safe. If you want to buy property, Mark can recommend some…""  
  
""I'm leaving with nothing,"" Amber interrupted. ""He's not giving me any money.""  
  
Mark's expression darkened. After devouring most of the ribs, he stood up and told Jordan, ""I forgot to mention, Mom wants to take you for a medical check-up in a few days. Clear out the guest room—family comes first.""  
  
Jordan remained silent as the front door opened and closed. Mark was gone.  
  
The feast on the table suddenly seemed to lose its appeal.  
  
""Sis, I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward position.""  
  
Jordan's eyes reddened as she sighed. ""I'm not uncomfortable. But how did things get like this between you two? I remember he used to be so good to you. When you secretly got a job without telling him, he scolded you. He worked five jobs a day to support both your educations, and all his scholarship money went to you. Remember that year when you nearly became brain-damaged in that car accident? He worked translations non-stop that year to earn money. How could he now…""  
  
Amber's throat ached, making even swallowing difficult.  
  
Precisely because their past life was impoverished yet beautiful, she had clung to this spider-silk-thin connection, carefully holding on for seven more years, only convincing herself to let go after being wounded beyond recognition.  
  
""Sis, I'll start looking for work this afternoon.""  
  
""Amber, if you need to cry, just cry.""  
  
She couldn't cry anymore. In three years of marriage, her tears had dried up.  
  
She ate breakfast and took on dishwashing duty. Jordan winced seeing those beautiful, slender hands stained with grease.  
  
""Those hands weren't made for housework. Even when Blake was at his poorest, he never let you do things like this.""  
  
Amber froze, waves of dense pain suddenly washing over her, making it hard to breathe.  
  
Jordan had to hurry off to work.  
  
Amber stayed alone until noon, then took her documents and went to the registry office.  
  
But even by one o'clock, Blake hadn't shown up.  
  
She took out her phone and called him.  
  
As usual, he didn't answer.  
  
She had no choice but to call Devon.  
  
""Mr. Ward, where's Blake?""  
  
""Mrs. Westwood, the boss is traveling on business. He might return in three days.""  
  
For these three years, Devon had been her only source of information about his schedule.  
  
She sat in the chair, feeling dizzy and unwell, resting her elbow on her knee. ""Could you give me his upcoming schedule? I want to see when he might be available.""  
  
Devon looked uncomfortably at the man sitting in the chair. The man's aura was cold, keeping people at a thousand-mile distance.

1lxd80q,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1lxd80q/electric_kettle_suggestions_for_matcha/,Electric kettle suggestions for matcha,"Looking for recommendations on a good electric kettle to get as a gift for someone. The details going into the decision are the following:

\- for someone who lives alone, so doesn't need to have a massive water capacity  
\- he only really drinks matcha, doesn't drink coffee or other teas  
\- given that it's primarily for matcha and not coffee, I'm not sure if I should look for a gooseneck or not  
\- looking for an electric option with temperature control (so there's options for other use cases)  
\- colour wise, black would be preferred, but stainless steel works too  
\- he generally prefers items with a bit of heft to them (so kettles on the super light side wouldn't be preferred, and if they skew a bit heavier that's ok)  
\- this is being shipped to a Canada residence, so sadly some options (like the Saki Luna, which I really liked the specs of, especially the lack of plastic) might not be as viable

  
I personally own a Breville IQ kettle that I've had for 7 years now that I enjoy, but unfortunately I don't have any other first hand experiences for where the market options are now. The gooseneck question is really my biggest pain point right now, as I don't know much about matcha brewing. I've looked at the Fellow Stagg and Corvo (which of course raises the gooseneck or not q) but to be frank it's a bit pricier than I'd like to spend. The Saki Luna looks quite nice, but the Canadian shipping piece is making me stall. There's some options on Amazon like the Cosori and Zwilling, but I want to make sure I'm not cheaping out anything if I should just go with a Fellow option.

Any suggestions or guidance would be super appreciated!",1,1752255543.0,tea,1,1.0,False

**Hey Coffee Community!**

To the aged connoisseurs here that have been in this jounrey since the inception of the sub, to fairly new members (like me) - I would like to discuss, know more and learn more about coffee, and what way to do it better than ***books***!?

I got into a speciality coffee journey since Jan and it has been so good, so claming, and almost therapeutic!

This post is not about my journey or to know more about the journey of people - here (thinking of a similar post soon tho, next month maybe XD)

This post is about the ***""""CHERRY BONES - JAMES HOFFMAN'S COFFEE MAGAZINE""""***

Have attatched the link to the video and it promises a lot of things - I strongly suggest you to watch the video to get a hint of what I am talking about!

The book costs Rs2300 (with shipping) and the prices are similar to the counterparts of the US/UK so they have been priced fairly good for all the markets there is!  
(shipping however says can take upto 30days)

I have never read a book on coffee, have read a lot of research papers, and a LOT of videos (well, who hasnt) but no - not physical books!  
(and I have a thing for physical books, I love to read)

Even tho this month has been crazy expensive in terms of ""EVERYTHING COFFEE"" - I still think I am gonna get this book, I wanted to bring this book to the attention of the community!

Also, I would love if the kind people here would drop the books - on coffee - about coffee - around coffee that they have had read, would suggest to read!

Coffee is an expensive hobby but it is worth it because it makes me want to actively chase everything it stands for!  
That first whiff of the fresh beans and the fresh brew, makes it worth it!

Looking forward to hearing from the sub, thanks for being the reason I moved ahead from instant coffee and found a safe place to mark my time at!

Cheers, peace!

This ordinance needs to be brought back to the public for a proper discussion instead of the city shoving it through in a rushed vote.

1lxd13t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Memoir/comments/1lxd13t/the_best_covid_story_youll_ever_hear/,The Best Covid Story You'll Ever Hear,"The best Covid story you’ll ever hear

The year was 2020 and as we all remember everything was going great. I had moved from Boston MA to Egypt after graduating my bachelors in 2018, with the goal of becoming fluent in arabic. I had started working at an NGO as a database manager and intern coordinator for the short term international interns that would come for a month or two to see Egypt and gain some experience. The job was alright and I met a lot of interesting people, many of whom I still keep up with today. However, there was one day that a girl walked in that would be remembered in infamy for all time. Her name was Aylin and she was from Turkey.

I was always concerned about in any way coming off as inappropriate as manager with our female interns but this girl and I kicked it off immediately and went on a few dates before she basically moved into my apartment and we started playing house (mind you she was only there for a month and a half internship so there was an expiry date on this).

We acted like a married couple and I introduced her to all of my friends and everything seemed amazing. There were a few moments of confusing anger from her but I figured that that's just part of being in a relationship. I was wrong but I also found out in the end that I was very good at making excuses to myself. We went on trips to all the most beautiful parts of Egypt (north coast mediterranean, east coast red sea, sinai peninsula, and the Siwa oasis). The siwa oasis was one of the experiences with her that really cemented my excuse making ability by way of her appealing to my dick.

We arrive in Siwa after a 10 hour bus ride and check into our eco lodge resort overlooking the lake in the middle of the desert and everything is bliss. Food is great, we’re relaxed, and then she hits me with: “Hey so my Turkish girlie is in Germany rn but she wants to come hang for a bit. Is that ok? Also by the way we can all have sex if you want”. And boy did I surrender any pretense of self preservation at that offer. Her friend comes and all of the above happens and I feel like there couldn’t possibly be anything wrong with this. I am full romcom holding a speaker above my head playing peter gabriel, end of the breakfast club Jud Nelson punching his hand in the air in love.

The problem then becomes when she has to go back to Turkey. Mind you this is end of february beginning of March 2020. There’s only been murmurings of Covid, nothing real outside of Italy and China. She flies back to Turkey and we stay in contact and I fall more in love while shes away. As March progresses and Covid becomes larger and more looming I begin to think in apocalyptic terms, and as a romantic nonse I decide to drop everything and fly to Istanbul to be with her before the expected airport closings. All of my friends and family advise against this but I was in love and stubborn. Internally I told myself this could either be the best decision of my life or the worst decision of my life.

Here ends the prologue

I get one of the last flights out of Cairo to Istanbul before the international flight ban and arrive in Istanbul to a still reasonably functioning world. Yes theres masks but nothing is closed and everyone is still out and about. I arrive at her apartment downtown and we spend about 3 or 4 days just bouncing around the sights. That said, Covid anxiety for everyone was still growing insidiously as it did in the first few weeks. One of my friends calls me trying to talk sense into me saying that if I don’t get back to Egypt soon I will be stuck in Turkey for the foreseeable. I tell him everything is perfectly under control and have funds put away for people to watch my apartment in Cairo and this is where I want to be right now (laughable).

We come up with the brilliant idea of renting a car in Istanbul (this car will be the crux of the story so don’t forget it) and driving down to the southern coast countryside (Izmir if I remember correctly). Basically functioning off of the zombie movie mentality of getting out of the large population concentrations to hunker down in nature. It’s a 12 hour drive we make over 2 days as Covid concern reaches a tipping point. We stop at a hotel for the first night of the drive and are the only people checking in. That was the first time I saw the forehead thermometer being actively used. We check into our room with a wonderful view and use the hot tub and everything is great until we’re lying in bed about to go to sleep. This was my first fiery red flag.

She tells me a story of a man that tried to rape her that she had to shoot and kill and has lived with that ever since. Obviously im appalled and heartbroken and traumatized by proxy that that had happened to her. She then starts laughing saying it was a joke and that im gullible. Like whaaaaat the fuck. I’m upset and leave the room for the first time realizing that I’ve put myself in a nonnegotiable Turkish border bound box with a person I’ve only known for 2 months now. I express my anger at that level of what the fuck she just displayed but she really was beautiful so again, excuses to myself.

We pack up the car and hit the road for the second day of the drive down to the southern coast. We had found a family owned small scale cabin hotel built on the side of a cliff in a village and contacted the owners explaining that we planned on quarantining and were able to pay a month in advance. We were told that currently it was just the family that owned the property and the staff that were staying there but if we could pay in cash for a month they could make an exception for us if we stayed in our rooms for the first few days for safety.

The first thing one of the workers told us after arriving was that this was a small isolated village and if anyone gets Covid they know who to blame. Great. After emerging from our isolation we began to get a sense of the area and the hotel. The views were truly breathtaking, the mountains, the mediterranean, the forest, not to mention that the stay included breakfast and dinner with fresh ingredients and bread baked daily. We had a private beach at the bottom of the cliff that was open to us because of the isolation of the property so we could swim and tan and everything really was perfect. For a bit.

If you’ve ever seen the show The Good Place, then you’ll know the feeling of wondering whether a place you’re in is truly too good to be true, and may in fact be The Bad Place.

End Intro

The first few weeks were beautiful as described, doing my best to learn usable turkish and watching everyone post about how much they hated being cooped up in their houses. Meanwhile I’m posting like an asshole my view and all my fun activities oblivious of Karma and thinking that I won the apocalypse.

That’s when concerns starting brewing about this person who I’m really starting to get to know. After about 2 weeks of honeymoon vibes I began to see changes in how we’d interact, with one of the first 3 being my watching reels on my phone while she was trying to get my attention and then having a knife fly by my head. She got my attention.

We settled into a rhythm of our breakfast served on the patio overlooking the sea and I continued just go with everything even though internally I was having major misgivings with how agitated she would get over small things. She would grow cold suddenly and unexplainably and then transition into yelling and throwing more things (thankfully not sharp things **most of the time**) over things like I watch the office too much and I’m not doing anything.

I voiced these concerns to my friends back in Egypt and America over calls and they were understandably concerned on my behalf but I always came back around to the idea that everything is \*fine\*. We were all drinking regularly but her changes when drinking were pretty alarming. I.e. demanding the keys to the rental car while she was obviously in the bag and threatening “bad things” if I didn’t give them to her. She would zoom off in this Turkish corolla rental (which was in my name and that is important) and disappear for hours only to come back with severe scrapes up and down the sides and one day with one of the rear view mirrors taped back on. More excuses on my part.

One day some of her friends that were floating around the area decided that we should grab some drinks and go to one of the 800 year old ruins out in the hills to go sit and drink in one of the church ruins, at night. Sounds metal but the experience was cursed. You walk into these walls of ancient construction and you could feel on the back of your neck that there was some kind of spirits in there that weren’t too fond of degenerates in their midst. One of these guys that we went there with was obviously a previous fling and she wasn’t exactly making it clear that she and I were a thing. Not a jealous type so nothing came of it but obviously not an inspiring experience for someone who pretty much made a leap of faith to be with this person during the most unprecedented moment of recent history.

Time goes by, about a month and a half, and the demanding of money and yelling and destroying the car continue while I begin to settle into the reality that the only international airport is 12 hours away, I don’t speak Turkish, and my only true companion is a manic and dangerous Turkish dream girl. One day she demands that I pay double the amount I was paying so that she could have her own cabin and space. At the time money wasn’t scarce but double a monthly quarantine fee was kind of pushing it. When I voiced my concerns she smashed a coffee cup on the ground and stormed off. She came back 30 minutes later while I’m eating lunch with her bags, dressed to leave. She told me to give her the car keys and that she was leaving. I said no the car is in my name and how am I supposed to get back to Istanbul by myself with no car. She lost it, threw her cigarette in my soup and said “You’ll never see me again, goodbye.”. Oh how I wish that was true.

She comes back 10 minutes later and we have a whole sit down as to what our plan is. I just want to preface that I cannot overemphasize how much of a siren’s control this woman had over me and my horny idiot brain.

We are now 2 months into our stay in this village hotel. We decide to leave this hotel and the lovely people that run it, to go to an air bnb at a nearby village. It has a pool and multiple rooms so we have more space to spread out and avoid conflict. We settle into the new place and begin to get along again.

That is, until the owner of the air bnb is notified of the payment he received from airbnb and then blames us for underpaying him, which we explain is completely out of our hands and the whole point of airbnb as a middle man in the transaction. We had bought groceries, gotten comfortable and he then threatens us that he will be calling the police and evicting us, against the airbnb agreement. Airbnb promises a full reimbursement for this acknowledging that the man obviously misunderstood the agreement with them and that we should probably just leave. Frantically we pack up our things to get the fuck out of dodge while booking another airbnb. The new owner is incredibly amenable and even acknowledges that the previous owner has a reputation for being impossible and we’re able to settle in.

New house, nicer pool, nicer yard, we have a nice few days of peace and no conflict. We’ve booked the place for a month and are comfortable. We go out for dinner one night and stop at a market for groceries, they are selling baby chicks and we decide to bring home three. Now we have children in between the conflicts that we’ve had for the last 2 months. Of course the patterns continue and all of my friends are telling me to duck and cover, easier said than done with the only airport in the country closed and 12 hours drive away. Go along to get along.

One night we’re watching a movie and there’s a minor disagreement over a plot point, actor did this or said that, it was so trite I really can’t even remember what it was. What I do remember was my saying that this is silly we shouldn’t be arguing over something like this. She looked me dead in the eyes and said, “Oh you want to see silly?”. She got up and walked into the kitchen grabbing about 6 plates. She looked at me and said “watch this” she smashed one, two, three, four plates. I said what the fuck are you doing? This isn’t our house this is insane, why?

That’s when she began hitting me. I’m a big guy, I played football for 15 years and I’ve been around 300 pounds since I was 16. I also know that nothing really good comes from responding in kind to violence. I throw my hands up in the air while she proceeds to scratch my face and punch my chest until she tires herself out. When she stops I say I’m going into this room, stay away from me, do not come near me. I barricade the door and the sliding glass door and eventually fall asleep with my jacket as a blanket because I didn’t want to risk having another confrontation to get a blanket.

I have a fitful and nightmarish sleep and wake up to something worse.

My wallet is next to me, open, with my credit card, the only source of money I had had the entire last several months, gone. I look over to the sliding glass door and she apparently had pried it open. The rental car is gone.

I go to the bathroom and my face and chest are scarred and bruised and the thought creeps up on me that, yea I might die in Turkey. I have a panic attack as one does and then, 10 minutes later, I get a call from her. She says hey baby I’m so sorry I just had to be away from you so I took the card and the car and drove but it’s ok now, I’m coming back. I whimper, Okay.

She comes back and I, traumatized and arguably broken, agree to allow things to return to a happy place. I forget and forgive but we also both agree that it might be in our best interest to get back to Istanbul to be near the airport when it eventually opens up. The roads are closed between here and there but we apply to a government office nearby given the circumstances for an exception. We receive permission and leave this beautiful hell.

After 2 months, driving along the entirely empty highways, I feel a sense of relief that I will finally be somewhere where I can actually have agency over my movement. We had been back into good terms for a few hours and she brings up a brilliant idea. Her parents live halfway along the trek back to the capital and wouldn’t it be grand if we stopped by for a night for me to meet them.

Obviously reluctant I said I’m not sure but she was insistent. I say “okay” for the thousandth godforsaken time and agree. However there is a caveat. Her parents are strict muslims and tattoos are a no go. I have a full sleeve on my right arm. Her solution is that we stop at a side of the highway bridal shop to find a last minute button down to cover the arm. To say it was ill fitting is an incredible understatement. We stop at a market and she suggests i get a gift. I buy a small ficus(???) and we headed to her parents house.

They do not speak english whatsoever, but after living in Egypt for several years I relatively understood how to be polite in a Muslim household. We had dinner and then I spent some time with her brother that had the best grasp of english of the family. He asked about how things were going and that she had said some things about us being long term. I said yes hoping to placate but the way that he looked at me felt almost as if he was trying to blink morse code to me that I should make for the hills, I grew up with what you’ve been dealing with and understand what you’ve probably seen.

We left for Istanbul the next morning, arrived, and this is where the bad part starts.

We get back to her apartment on a peaceful level and things are not entirely bad for a period of time. She strongly suggests that we should buy some cocaine to while away the hours while we wait out the airport and of course my dumb ass capitulates. We drive half way across the empty city to collect and now I have a “you’re going to Turkish jail for the rest of your life” amount of drugs in my boxers. Obviously, we get stopped at a checkpoint and thank god just the fact that I was an american was enough of a novelty for this officer to say “Enjoy Turkey!” and send us on our way. I’ve since seen The Midnight Express and now understand the gravity of the luck I enjoyed in that moment.

We get back to her apartment and surprisingly, adding cocaine to this emotional and interpersonal dynamic was not beneficial. The surprise outbursts of yelling and throwing things began again and in one fateful argument she stands up and says to me “You know what? My ex boyfriend is throwing a party tomorrow and I’m gonna go but YOU can’t come”. I take a second to internalise this and think A. You’re going to your ex boyfriends party and I, your current boyfriend, can’t come. Okay and B. WE’RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING TO A PARTY.

I decide enough is enough, I’m not reliant on this person anymore. Enough is enough, I need to leave. I pack up my things and drive to the Radisson Blu, one of the only 4 or so hotels open throughout the city. I wash my hands of the whole thing, and this is where the story gets bad.

Final Act

After checking in and beginning to figure out how I’m going to get out of this country I fall into a deep sleep for the night. The next morning I am inundated by texts and calls from her saying that the car rental people are demanding that we return their car. Yes the car from the beginning.

We had paid for a month's rental of this car, it had been three months. They are threatening to report us to the police if this is not rectified immediately and this is where I get sucked back in. I agree to go back with her to the rental car company. She arrives at the hotel in the beat up sedan and as I get into the car she is staring at me with the anger of someone whose guinea pig I had killed a la Dwight and Angela’s cat Sprinkles. We drive to this rental car office on the outskirts of the city on what looked like a rainy day. It would be in more ways than I knew.

We reach the lot and she stops the car, outside of the gate. We are on a hill, a low incline hill but a hill nonetheless. She gets out of the car and walks over to the parking lot. I am still in the passenger seat. The car is not in park. I am now rolling. I’m able to jump out of the passenger seat and run to the drivers to reverse the car and drive it onto the lot. I realize that this woman just passively tried to kill me and put away those thoughts, dreaming of the minute I can get back to safety and be done with this.

The attendants see the car and tell us that between the missing rental of the two months and the damage put on the car, they are owed 1600 dollars. I had an emergency credit card with that amount but that was about how much I had besides the amount I needed to stay in the hotel until the airports opened.

However, they informed us that our insurance on the rental will actually cover the damage if we were to get a police statement outlining an accident. In our infinite wisdom we then decide to go stage a minor traffic accident in the hopes of getting this report. We call a taxi to come to the rental car lot to take us back after we finish this and we leave our luggage with this taxi. Fatal mistake.

We take the car down the Istanbul freeway looking for strips of paint on the guardrail that match the height of some of the scratches on the side of the car, find one, and call the Turkish police. Now we’re waiting, the clouds are growing darker, I’m dreaming of the mythical day when I’ll be free of this experience.

After about 5 minutes I look over at her and she is giving me a glare that you see before a knife enters your throat. She screams “YOURE NOT DOING ENOUGH”. Confused, I ask what she means, she repeats herself. I ask again what do you mean I’m paying for everything?” She begins slamming her fists off the passenger window, the dashboard, and me. I honestly thought she was going to set off the airbag.

The realization comes to me that I’m sitting in the middle of an empty highway with a person unhinged, and the police are on the way. I decide that okay fuck it, I will go ahead and max out this emergency credit card. I start driving back to the rental car lot, internally feeling as if this were my personal hell. It got so much worse.

Driving back it was eerily quiet. I stopped at a stop sign, looked left, looked right, and shes just out of the car, door left open, and shes walking in the opposite direction. I turn the car around and say what the fuck are you doing where are you going? She says fuck you I’m done. Sticks her thumb up in the road, car stops she gets in, and she’s gone. I’m now on my own.

The problem here was that this taxi mentioned above, she was the only person that had that driver’s number. All of my things up to and including my passport were in that car. I go back to the rental car office and proceed to max out this credit card and ask the gentlemen there if they could please help me find the taxi driver that was there before we left. They didn’t speak a lick of English so our conversation was handing a phone back and forth using google translate.

Then. Oh god then. With a strike of lighting I turn around and she’s standing at the gate of the parking lot. She says to me, “If you want your things come with me”. Accepting my fate that this may very well be my gallows walk I followed her down this long road in the outskirts of Istanbul. Poetically, it began to rain as we walked. She proceeded to scream and berate and excoriate me with some of the most hurtful things she could come up with but given the circumstances I understood I’m working with a scary and irrational actor, and she’s holding all of the cards. 10 minutes walking down this road being decimated emotionally in the rain, agreeing with her in the hopes that at the end of this road she’ll give my passport back.

She stops. Looks and me in the eyes and says Fuck You, I’m Done (again) and sticks her thumb out into the road and another car stops and she gets in and I’m alone again. Basically in the same pickle as before but I’m a 15 minute walk through the rain back to the rental car office.

I get back and talk to the same men over google translate, this time pleading, to help me find this taxi driver that had all of my things. Full panic attack in the parking lot.

And then.

One of the rental car men gets a phone call from her, instructing him to call another taxi to bring me to a hotel near her apartment. Now there’s a secondary location. One of the men holds the phone up to me with the translation “Is this woman taking advantage of you?”. I type back “She has my passport, I have to do what she says”. He looks back at me with a mixture of pity and understanding, as if he’d been somewhere like that, but not that deep. We waited together and he wished me luck, I got in death cab for cutie and sat in the backseat as we drove through this ghost city to this unknown location, questioning every decision I’ve ever made that lead me to this point.

Now, this is my favorite part, the taxi drivers phone rings. He answers it and turns around handing me his cell phone, “It’s for you”. I’m thinking I don’t know you I’m not from here what is this Jason Bourne Taxi Driver Sleeper Cell shit.

I take the phone from this man and I hear over the receiver, “Hello Kent, It’s me. I went through all of your things and your accounts on your computer and I didn’t like what I saw. Now I have your clothes, your shoes, your bags, and your passport out on my lawn right now and if you don’t fix this, I’m going to light them on fire”

I know

What she was upset about were the messages I had been sending to my friends in Egypt and America telling them that I felt unsafe and didn’t know what to do. She took offense to that and told me that my solution was to message one of my friends that was the most outspoken about the way I was being treated, while she was logged in simultaneously and overseeing the conversation. She said that I needed to tell her that I was lying and overexaggerating and that I was the one to blame and if it didn’t go well then my passport was as good as gone.

Thankfully I had one emergency international call left on my phone. I called this friend and asked her to please play along and accept what i was saying, please placate her or ill be living under a Turkish bridge for the foreseeable future. She says no problem and then the curtain opens.

“I’m so sorry for misrepresenting what was happening, I was the one that was toxic and I need help. She has been perfectly kind to me this entire time.”

“Oh I’m really disappointed in you and I don’t know what to say, do better”

At this point I’ve been dropped off at this secondary location, a hotel in her neighborhood and I’m pacing in the parking lot hoping that this ruse was believable enough to earn my things back.

I get a call from her and in a scarily different tone, think lovey and cutesy, she tells me that she’s so proud of me for being so open and honest about my issues and that shes going to come pick me up and bring me back to stay at her place until this is all over. I shrink in the rain, I’d hoped she’d just bring my things back but apparently the show must go on.

She arrives at the hotel in another taxi and when I get it its as if nothing from the last few hours had expired. She called me baby and hugged me and kissed me, meanwhile I am playing the show of my life while I’m clocking bridges on the way back that I could potentially sleep under.

We get back to her apartment and it was as if my bags had exploded in her living room. She had pulled out and thrown all of my things on the floor, looking for what I’m not sure. Obviously terrified I pretend as if nothing is amiss. I ask if I could please have my passport back. She turns with a penetrating glare and asks “WHY?”. Taken slightly aback I say hoping to avoid any agitation, “oh just cuz I’d like to have it back and put everything away so we can clean up and make the place nice”. She looks back and says “fine”. Boy I shit you not she goes under the sink pulls out 4 pots and then a rice cooker and pulls my fucking passport out of it. To say I basically stapled that thing to my leg is an understatement.

I began to slowly pack all of my things so as not to arouse suspicion. A shirt, boxers, shorts, reeeaaalll slow and easy like. As I’m doing this, every 15 to 20 minutes or so she demands to see my phone, says that she needs to make sure I’m not texting my friends about her. At that point she’d seen all of my cries for help so I had nothing to hide so the first few times I was like fine. The fourth time however when I said I’m going to the bathroom she tells me I’m not allowed my phone in the bathroom. I was like fuck this no this is ridiculous.

She gets up and grabs my playstation that I had brought with me. I ask her what exactly she’s doing. She informs me that she’s going to smash it because I’m not doing what she says. I calmly take it from her hands and put it in one of my bags. Now I’m packing a little bit quicker. I feel a \*whoosh\* of air by my head and one of the controllers slams off the wall. NOW I’m packing in a hurry.

One of my bags, a backpack from my grandmother, was sitting about 4 feet from where I was packing another bag. In an instant she sprints, grabs that backpack, runs out the door of her apartment with it. My computer being in that bag I followed, she slams through the building door into the courtyard. It is POURING rain. It’s giving climax scene. I grab the bag and she turns around and fucking pops me one right in the face. She screams “You need to get out of here! I’m calling the police!”. I’m like all of my things are in your apartment, you’re actually robbing me right now.

At this point all of the neighbors, like the rest of the world, had been shut into their apartments for months now and so obviously live action drama from their balconies was the best show in town. Everyone’s leaning over and watching and she screams up to them in Turkish, obviously good things, and I just say, hopefully but without conviction, “please help me this woman is stealing my things”.

Someone buzzes the door and she runs in, slamming the door behind her. At that point I had my phone, my wallet, my passport, the bag, and the clothes on my back (shorts and tshirt). I’m standing in the pouring rain realizing that this is probably the end of the road. But you’d be mistaken.

I hear a bang come out from the garden behind her apartment. Figuring I might as well investigate I see my poor playstation heaving its hard drive onto the wet grass. Thinking no man left behind I put this smashed playstation into my backpack in the rain ready to leave when I hear a tap tap tap on the bay window from her apartment.

Like a Bond villain she signals with a single finger to come to the window.

On the floor around her was a pile of all of my things, clothes, shoes, bags.

She’s pooring lighter fluid on this pile, on her \*\*carpeted\*\* living room floor. She makes a watch this motion and lights a match.

The whole room ignites with smoke pouring out of all the windows.

I take this as my signal to leave and spend the next 15 minutes walking the streets of an empty Istanbul, shoeless in the rain. I somehow find a taxi driver and spend the last 20 Euros in my wallet to be brought back to the Radisson Blu. And the same man that watched me leave that morning watched me walk back in, drenched, dirty, shoeless, and broken.

He looked at me and just asked, “Tough day?”

1lxcyfd,https://v.redd.it/wqpzzmia4acf1,I built a custom GPT agent for retail marketing using GPT-4. Here’s what it does and how I structured it. 🧑‍💻,"I wanted to share a case study from a project I recently completed using GPT-4 and custom instructions and Project memory system. I built a custom GPT agent called TheMarketingGoodsGPT for a retail business that needed help creating compliant, hyperlocal marketing content.

Instead of using a generic prompt, I treated this like building a smart internal content team member using my decade+ marketing knowledge. Here’s how I set it up:

What it’s trained to do:

• Generate social, SMS, and email copy using brand-safe and on-brand language (they are based in New Jersey)
• Write SEO-friendly product descriptions based on the store’s actual inventory
• Create educational content and FAQs for staff and customers
• Suggest campaign ideas based on holidays, product categories, and local trends
• Automatically build SEO templates optimized for Google and AI search engines like Perplexity

How I built it:

• I uploaded product data and inventory descriptions as long-term memory references
• I created separate content “verticals” (e.g. social, SMS, promo, blog, SEO) with tone, goals, and example formatting
• Added geo-targeted logic to reference common local events and trends (think like calling out a location they like to hang out at during the weekend or their favorite coffee shop — good for future collabs and outreach)
• Programmed brand guidelines into the prompt logic to avoid flagging or compliance issues
• Built a workflow using persistent instructions and test prompts for ongoing refinement

The results:

• Cut content ideation time for their team by 60–70%
• Generated locally relevant ideas the in-house team hadn’t thought of
• Helped create a full 30-day content calendar with minimal input based on pre-existing concepts and inventory

I’m sharing this because I think GPT agents like this can go far beyond generic use, and serve as truly embedded tools in various and also niche industries.

Happy to answer any questions about how I structured the prompt logic or how memory + Projects were used here. Curious to hear how others are using GPT agents in real-world business settings.",0,1752254907.0,OpenAI,0,0.25,False

1lxcuwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lxcuwn/does_the_keurig_kexpress_coffee_maker_live_up_to/,Does the Keurig K-Express Coffee Maker Live Up to Its Bold Claims?,"Sleek, functional coffee makers are a game-changer for mornings, and the Keurig 062151516229 stands out immediately with its stylish build and user-friendly features. As someone who relies heavily on coffee to kickstart my day, this single-serve brewer has quickly become an integral part of my daily routine. It offers the perfect mix of modern looks, versatility, and convenience, but there are certainly a few things worth noting before diving in.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The first time I set eyes on this coffee maker, I immediately appreciated its sleek, compact design. Its black metallic finish blends seamlessly with my kitchen decor, adding a touch of modern sophistication. Measuring 14.65”D x 7.28”W x 12.87”H, it sits unobtrusively on the countertop without hogging valuable space. Despite its small footprint, it doesn’t skimp on features. I’m able to showcase my minimalist kitchen setup without sacrificing functionality in the process.

**Features That Make Brewing Simple**  
What drew me initially to this brewer was its fully automatic operation. I barely need to lift a finger to get my coffee brewing. It includes presets that can brew 8, 10, or 12 oz cups at the touch of a button, which fits perfectly, whether I need a quick shot of energy or a larger mug for leisurely sipping. The 42 oz removable reservoir is particularly handy because it allows me to make four cups before needing a refill. It’s a huge time-saver, especially during busy mornings or when entertaining guests.

**Positives**  
- **STRONG Button Feature**: I can’t emphasize enough how much I adore the STRONG button. For someone who enjoys their coffee on the bolder side, it has delivered a noticeable kick to my brews that rivals café-quality espresso.  
- **Versatility**: From pods to ground coffee using the separately sold My K-Cup filter, this brewer accommodates my coffee whims with ease. It even lets me make tea or hot cocoa on days when I need a break from caffeine.  
- **Back-to-back Brewing**: Not having to wait for the water to reheat when preparing a second cup feels like a blessing, especially for those back-to-back caffeine emergencies.

[Check Keurig 062151516229 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b098zqlkq5/)  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
In terms of performance, this machine has been exceptionally fast and reliable. The brewing process takes just a few minutes, and the results are consistent. Whether I’m using K-Cup pods or ground coffee, the final product has always delivered the rich, full-bodied flavor I love. Even the machine noise is standard—enough to let me know it’s working but not loud enough to disrupt a peaceful morning.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- **Reservoir Capacity**: While the 42 oz reservoir is sufficient most of the time, refills become an annoyance during larger gatherings. A slightly bigger tank would have been ideal.  
- **Lack of Temperature Control**: It would have been nice to see an adjustable temperature setting for customizing my coffee exactly to my liking.  
- **Reusable Filter Sold Separately**: The fact that the My K-Cup reusable filter isn’t included feels like a minor inconvenience.

**Rival Brands for Comparison**  
Compared to others like the Nespresso Vertuo or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, this single-serve brewer strikes a nice balance between price and functionality. The Nespresso offers luxurious frothing options but lacks the option for ground coffee input unless you splurge on upgrades. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach allows for larger brewing capacities but misses the modern aesthetic and STRONG button functionality that makes the Keurig an excellent all-rounder. For anyone seeking a mid-range coffee maker that balances simplicity with versatility, this model edges ahead.

**Quality for Price**  
This single-serve brewer doesn’t feel overpriced for what it offers. It lands in that sweet spot where affordability meets solid performance, making it an excellent pick for home, office, or even RV use. While you could argue that some additional features like temperature control or a larger reservoir would enhance its value, it’s hard to complain when the quality of the coffee produced is consistently top-notch.

They had been counselors for so long now that especially Jason was confident he could answer any question other counselors shot at him. The brothers also had experience organizing counselor meetings - today’s took place in the Eros cabin.

The Eros cabin was a love god cabin through and through, the inside smelled of fresh sweet roses and everyone who entered the cabin would feel a brief hugging sensation. A marble floor led into the cabin’s common room, where a sectional couch, a matching loveseat, and red pillows made up the seating area for the day. A tray with snacks and drinks sat on the coffee table.

Counselors and leaders would gather in this living room, where Austin and Jason welcome them to the counselor meeting. Once enough people gathered, Jason would kick off the meeting with a sharp whistle.

‘’Sup, tools.’’ Jason greeted with a wide grin and a wave. ‘’Name’s Jason, my brother over there is Austin. Welcome to the counselor meeting, eyes open, you don’t want to miss this pretty face telling you what’s up.’’

Chocolate brown eyes scanned the crowd. ‘’New faces! Ivy, Ursula, others-who-I’ve-forgot, hi! Other counselors, give ‘em a warm welcome.’’ he said, his smile beaming.

‘’We’d like to start by congratulating the Heracles, Muse, and Hades cabins for winning last season. Jonathan, Harper and Dorian, Matt: congratulations.’’ the more serious twin chimed in. Austin leaned relaxedly against the chair. ‘’How’s everyone doing? We’ve noticed there have been a lot of cabin meetings lately. Are all your siblings doing well?’’ 

‘’We know it’s been like, *a lot* recently with Atlas and what-not. Camp’s boats got blown to bits, New London is happening, and we’d like to check if anyone has any crazy plans we need to inform Chiron about. Like, that not someone returns in a box.’’ Jason said, deadpan.

‘’What Jason is trying to say -’’ Austin began as he shot a meaningful glare at his brother ‘’- is that what’s happening in New London is something very serious. If you have any concerns about what’s going on, please tell us. No one’s coming back in a box, Jason.’’

‘’That’s what I said, but I said it prettier,’’ Jason argued, to which Austin rolled his eyes.

‘’Lastly, we’re curious what kind of activities everyone is planning to host this season. We don’t want too much overlap, I don’t think.’’ Austin said with an awkward smile as he let people begin their discussions.

\
(Worthy Satire) - What began as a routine transatlantic flight turned into a bizarre survival scenario when a Delta Airlines plane was forced to make an emergency landing on a remote island in the Azores. The passengers, stuck on the tarmac and later on the island for over 24 hours, faced a surreal twist: the in-flight entertainment system remained frozen on the TV series LOST — the irony not lost on anyone.\
\
“We thought it was just a rough patch of turbulence,” said one passenger. “Then the engine sputtered, the captain said we were diverting to an island, and suddenly every screen on the plane started playing scenes of people crashing and foraging in the jungle. Not exactly reassuring.”\
\
As hours passed with limited communication from Delta and diminishing snack supplies, survival instincts began to emerge. Passengers started organizing into task groups — one for food inventory, one for scouting restroom access, and another for “keeping morale from collapsing into full-blown panic.”\
\
Flight attendants, who remained calm and professional, attempted to downplay the situation, offering lukewarm coffee and explaining that a relief flight was ""definitely probably on the way."" Meanwhile, one man tried to fashion a fishing rod out of a seatbelt extender and a stir stick. Others debated rationing biscotti.\
\
“Watching LOST on repeat while being literally lost is... psychologically complex,” noted another traveler. “At one point, I caught myself wondering if the island wanted us here.”\
\
A Delta spokesperson issued a statement saying they were working quickly to get the passengers home and added that the looped entertainment was ""an unfortunate coincidence,"" though passengers suspected otherwise. By hour 20, some had stopped watching and started taking notes — “just in case.”\
\
All passengers are safe, and the relief plane is expected to arrive “shortly.” Until then, they remain stuck between a malfunctioning jet and a psychologically haunting television marathon — wondering what’s real, and whether there’s any more ginger ale.\
\
Worthy Satire is meant purely for comedic purposes—after all, as Proverbs reminds us, “Laughter is good medicine.” But behind every satire is a real story, video, or event. For the unspun version of the headline, be sure to check out the original source.  \

1lxcrif,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1lxcrif/a_milestone_in_my_btc_journey/,A Milestone in My BTC Journey 🚀,"  
Today, I quietly crossed a personal milestone — I’ve officially accumulated **10 million Sats**! I can’t express how grateful and proud I feel. It might not sound like much to some, but for me, it’s a big step toward financial freedom and long-term vision.

Here’s how I did it — nothing fancy, just small, consistent choices:

1. **Skipped my daily Tim Hortons coffee and wrap** — That’s $10 saved almost every day. Small sacrifice, big impact.
2.  **I used my Shakepay card for all purchases,** and the Bitcoin I earned from daily spending added up quicker than I expected.
3. **Did surveys on AddSlice** — Just a few minutes here and there, and free sats started trickling in.
4. **Bought the dip whenever I could** — Even if it was just a few bucks, I stacked as much as I could during those red days.

These steps might seem small, funny, or even strange, but they work. What matters is **consistency** and a belief in the long game.

So if you're stacking sats and feel like your progress is slow, **don’t give up**. Every Sat counts. Keep going. One day, you’ll look back and smile — just like I am today.

**Stay humble, stay focused, and keep stacking.** ",8,1752254462.0,Bitcoin,1,1.0,False
1lxcrhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lxcrhk/how_does_don_franciscos_kona_blend_coffee_pod/,How does Don Francisco's Kona Blend Coffee Pod Review Stack Up for Flavor?,"The Don Francisco's 3535 Kona Blend Medium Roast Coffee Pods have found a permanent spot in my morning routine. As someone who thrives on coffee, testing this product felt like a delightful adventure, and I’ve got plenty to share. With a blend featuring 10% authentic Kona coffee and premium Arabica beans, these pods promise to deliver a Hawaiian-inspired kickstart to your day. After discovering this blend, mornings feel a little sunnier.

**Design and Compatibility**  
The single-serve pods are impressively convenient and compatible with all Keurig K-Cup brewers. I’ve personally tried them with my Keurig machine, and each brew has been seamless. No clogging, no mess—just a smooth process that breathes life into your first cup. The recyclable design through TerraCycle is a thoughtful nod towards sustainability, a feature I hadn’t initially expected but fully appreciate now. As someone trying to reduce waste, this little aspect gives the pod an extra edge over other coffee options.

[Check Don Francisco's 3535 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b079zbsh2k/)

**Flavor Profile and Aroma**  
A medium roast is my sweet spot, and this blend hits it perfectly. The notes of subtle fruitiness combined with a delicate floral aroma are simply enchanting. Even my non-coffee-drinking roommate paused to comment on how lovely the kitchen smelled. Each sip strikes a perfect balance—rich, smooth, and never bitter. Bonus points: that tropical undertone is undoubtedly the star of the show. It managed to transport me (mentally, of course) straight to Hawaii. You truly start anticipating mornings because of this unique flavor.

**Strengths**  
- Exceptional flavor profile with tropical and floral notes.  
- Keurig compatibility for effortless brewing.  
- Eco-friendly focus with recyclable pods.  
- Consistently smooth and rich coffee experience.  

**Performance Over Time**  
Having worked my way through almost half of the 100-count box gives me the authority to judge consistency. Every pod delivers the same bold yet smooth flavor that the first one did. That’s reliability. I’ve experimented with different cup sizes on my machine, and while the recommended 8 oz setting results in the most robust flavor, I found even larger cups maintained a good depth.

Other brands I've tried before often faltered halfway through the package—either going stale or losing flavor intensity. That has not been the case here. In fact, I brought some pods to work, and even with a regular office brewer, the results were lovely.  

**Good Points**  
- Well-sealed packaging preserves freshness throughout use.  
- Reliable flavor and aroma across all pods.  
- Works wonderfully even with non-ideal brewers, like older Keurig models.  

**Critiques**  
However, not everything’s a bed of roses—or in this case, a cup of premium Kona blend.   
- The 10% Kona could disappoint those expecting a higher percentage of Hawaiian beans.  
- Stronger caffeine enthusiasts may feel it's not as potent as dark roasts.  
- Pods aren’t compostable, so while they are recyclable, eco-purists may feel slightly underwhelmed.

**Peer Products**  
Comparing it to some notable competitors like Starbucks K-Cup® Pods or Dunkin' K-Cups reveals interesting insights. Starbucks tends to be bolder (a win for strong coffee lovers) but can lean a bit bitter, especially in their medium roasts. Dunkin’ has a smoother and lighter profile but lacks the unique Kona-inspired edge that sets this blend apart. Don Francisco's stands out for its aromatic complexity. Yet, if sustainability were compostable pods, brands like San Francisco Bay Coffee may beat them in that department. Still, the tropical flair and consistent quality here make this pod a personal standout.

**Value Proposition**  
Looking at the monetary aspect of this product, it is refreshingly fair. You’re not just paying for coffee; you’re investing in a slice of rich coffee heritage that dates back to the 1870s, paired with modern convenience. Comparable premium pods don’t always offer the same aromatic journey or thoughtful features such as compatibility and recycling. Put against the flavor and ease it provides, the cost feels reasonable, making this an excellent choice for anyone passionate about their coffee.

1lxcid0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1lxcid0/accessible_room_failure_with_hygiene_and_fire/,Accessible Room failure with hygiene and fire safety failures.,"I decided to book a disabled room at a hotel at the small city of St David's which was all well and good.

When I did get to the hotel I didn't think there'd be any concerns. That was until I got in the room. I was taken in to the room by the member of staff.

The first thing I'd noticed was there was a sofa in the room practically touching the bed leaving no spaces to move around. Not only that, the sofa blocked the secondary fire exit which the fire brigade would say is a big no no.

I had the sofa moved out of the way so I could actually manoeuvre around. Where the sofa was situated I had found dead insects which appeared to be cockroaches. I told a member of staff later and he came in with a leaf blower to blow them out the secondary door outside. Spiders and cobwebs covered the ceiling with flies in the room.

I went to the bathroom to find that there was mould on the ceiling and the tiles looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in forever. There was no chair available in the wet room so I could shower nor were there any grab rails or emergency cords. Had I used the shower and slipped I'd have not been able to call for assistance. I have thus chosen not to use the shower. The ceiling lights had dead insects in them also.

I did not sleep very well. But I was hoping breakfast would be a little better and boy was I wrong. I ate the mushrooms and the sausages but nothing else. The bacon looked undercooked that it should have been oinking at me. I did not finish it and went out for the day and bought a banana.

The dining room was very cluttered with no space to move.

I have also not used any of the in room amenities such as the soap or tea/coffee station. Would hate to see how grimey the kettle is.

How can a hotel get away with this many fire safety violations and hygiene violations? Surely they should be shut down? Of course I will make a complaint to the local authority along with the photographs I have.",2,1752253875.0,hotels,0,1.0,False

Manually researching leads and writing custom emails was just too slow.

So I built PitchPilot an automation that finds lead info, generates hyper-personalized messages, and follows up like a human, at scale.

Tools used: Make, Apollo, Clearbit, OpenAI, Google Sheets, Gmail, and Trello

Here’s how PitchPilot works:

* Pulls new leads from Apollo,  into Google Sheets
* Enriches lead data with Clearbit
* OpenAI generates a customized cold email referencing the person’s role, company, and recent LinkedIn activity
* Sends the email via Gmail, spaced out with delay logic to avoid spam flags
* Waits 3 days, if no reply, sends a light follow up that feels human, not automated
* If a reply comes in, it’s sent to Trello with tags like “Interested,” “Not Now,” or “Referral” based on AI summary
* All stats (open rate, reply rate, win rate) are tracked in the Google Sheet automatically

The founder now sends 50+ personalized emails per day with almost no manual input and response rates went up *after* automating.

If you’re running outbound sales and still doing it all manually, this kind of flow will change your game.

My biggest tip for any avid iced coffee drinkers is to make your own cold brew concentrate. The recipe I'm going to share below is concentrated to be used like espresso so you can use it to make lattes! You do not need any fancy expensive equipment to make cold brew at all! The consumerist machine tries to sell you special little cold brew brewers and shit that you do not need at all!! 

You will need: 

12oz (340g) ground coffee
     • if you can source this locally from a local shop, that's awesome! Have them grind it for French press. Otherwise, regular bagged ground coffee from the grocery store works great! I recommend a medium or a dark roast. 

A 1 gallon sized pitcher or other container 
     • they sell these for less than $5 at most major retail stores. I just use a 1 gallon pickle jar that my parents have had since I was a kid and that I asked for when I moved out.

Tap water

A clean piece of fabric you don't mind getting stained
     • I use a flowersack towel for bread making that I got at Aldi, but really any fabric will work as long as it's not too linty. 

A colander

A large bowl or other secondary container

Process: 

• Add your ground coffee to your container 
• Fill with water, ensuring you get all of the grounds wet while doing this 
• Cover & leave 18-24 hours at room temp
temperature
• When it's time to pull the cold brew, take your colander & put it in your secondary container. Line it with your fabric (this will act as your filter). 
• Pour your cold brew through the fabric so it catches all the grounds. 
• Put the filtered cold brew into your container of choice & store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. 

Recipes: 

16oz Latte

• 3oz cold brew concentrate
• 1oz syrup of choice (if desired) 
• Fill cup with ice
• Milk of choice to the top
• Stir well

16oz Cold Brew
• 6oz cold brew concentrate
• Fill cup with ice
• Water to top

12oz Hot Coffee
• 3oz cold brew concentrate
• Fill mug with boiling water

With these recipes, keep in mind that coffee shops put a lot of ice into these drinks. That helps keep the ratio of cold brew to milk correct. If you are going to do less ice, make sure you add more cold brew concentrate, otherwise the drink is going to taste watered down. 

As for syrup, there are lots of awesome syrup recipes out there, including dupes for chain coffee shop syrups. Do some googling. Simple syrup is so simple to make and you probably already have the ingredients in your house to make them. You definitely don't have to buy syrup, either!

1lxcecx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1lxcecx/easy_ecommerce_ad_creatives_you_can_make_today/,Easy E-Commerce Ad Creatives You Can Make Today,"Hey guys,

I'm currently working with a couple of brands in the apparel space who were 100% constrained by ad creative. I can only make so many canva graphics and product catalog ads have gotten stale.

Furthermore, when broaching the subject with them, they agree they need better creative but don't want to pay for a videographer (the perfect storm, I know).

After racking my brain, I came up with several easy video ideas they could film themselves, and most are performing well and generating incremental ROAS above benchmark.

I thought I'd pass some of the best performing ideas along in case y'all were in a similar boat!

All of these can be filmed via cell phone. A lapel mic isn't required but would provide better audio. 

**1.) Pack an Order**

I got this idea from brands like Oats Overnight and Javvy Coffee. You literally just film yourself (or someone else) packing an order. Explain the products the person ordered and the value they provide your avatar.

Another huge benefit is, since you're filming something you'd be doing anyway, you can film a TON of these and easily end up with 10+ versions.

You could also just stage a few of these if you don't already get a bunch of orders to pack.

Bonus points if your products come in packaging that crinkles for the ASMR effect.

**2.) ""Walk & Talk"" Through Warehouse or Store**

This is another simple one. Just film the founder (or film yourself if that's you) walking through your warehouse or physical store talking about how and why the business started and the value the product provides.

Change up the order of the script and film in a few different settings/backdrops for more variations.

**3.) Staged Unboxing Video**

Have an employee (or employees) film an unboxing video, where you stage a package at their doorstep, and they just film themselves grabbing it off the stoop/out of the mailbox, unpacking, and holding up the product. 

This works best with a voiceover describing why they purchased the product and how it makes their life better.

**4.) Give Store Credit for a Video Testimonial**

Email your existing, or even better recurring, customers offering them $25/$50/$100 (the more the better) in store credit for submitting a video testimonial that you can use in marketing materials. Anyone who takes you up on it should be sent specific instructions on how to film the video and a script structure.

Instructions: Vertically filmed, selfie style

Script: Here's the problem I was having, here's how I found \[brand\], and here's how my life has drastically improved thanks to \[product\].

You ethically can't specifically ask for a POSITIVE testimonial, but it's implied enough in the request I wouldn't expect to receive any negative ones. Still, if they do give a negative review, offer the store credit anyway. Then, use the positive videos as ad creative!

I enjoy the simple things. Quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime and board games, so you could say I’m a bit nerdy. :)

I don’t smoke or drink, and I’m not very religious, but I believe in kindness and keeping an open mind.

I'm looking for someone 30 or younger. What matters most to me is a strong connection, emotionally and physically. I tend to feel that spark more with women who are slim, fit, or have an average build. Just being honest about what I’m usually drawn to.

One thing that’s important for me to say early on is that I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know it’s a big thing to mention, but it feels right to be honest about what matters.

Given the more personal nature of this, I created a separate account. Everyone's posts helped me so much (thank you!) and I wanted to try to do the same for others. I'm also going to try to separate this into sections for easy reading! 

**Diagnosis and Symptoms:** 

* **Diagnosis**: Went in for a routine exam (never had), doctor immediately seemed concern regarding stomach protrusion and hardness. 
   * I thought for some time (a few months) my stomach had been protruding more than usual, but chalked it up to concerns of dietary issues or maybe even weight gain. I'd always had a little lower stomach bulge and thought it was something else. Disclaimer: though I was familiar with many other conditions, such as PCOS, I actually was completely unfamiliar with fibroids. 
   * Based on further questions, doctor suspected it was a fibroid and referred me for a transvaginal ultrasound, which confirmed fibroid. 
* Due to personal circumstances, my timeline for being able to receive treatment was very short (a few months) and I communicated this to doctors. I feel very lucky that each doctor I saw immediately believed the fibroid needed removal, whether through UFE or myomectomy. I know others have struggled and been dismissed. 
* **Size**: MRI diagnosed 19 cm fibroid. Laparoscopic myomectomy was unavailable due to size, but a mini laparotomy or open myomectomy possible. I wanted as minimally invasive as possible and opted for mini laparotomy as outpatient. 
* **Symptoms:** 
   * Frequent urination. It was pressing on my bladder and resulting in backup in kidney. 
   * Ongoing feeling of bloat. Sometimes I experienced it less if I didn't have anything to eat, or the first few days following end of period, but it was very ongoing.
   * Protruding, hard lower stomach. For a long time, in retrospect, it seemed like weight gain or bloat. In the couple months prior to diagnosis, I looked visibly pregnant.
   * Now and again I would have sharp stabbing pain in my lower back as well as in my lower right stomach. I think this may have been caused by the fibroid, but not confirmed. 
   * Over the past year and a half, my period symptoms became worse --  nausea beforehand, more mood swings, more pain. I'd luckily never had super eventful periods before this, but the PMS I had was definitely worse. I started taking Vitamin D and felt much improvement with this so didn't think too much on it. **Note:** this is not me recommending vitamin D as a fix for fibroids! Just adding context to symptoms and how I perceived them. 
   * The fibroid never caused super heavy bleeding, nausea, or intense ongoing period pain, and the other symptoms came on so gradually that it was hard for me to recognize they were abnormal. 

*  **Surgery Experience**

**Doctors, Nurses**: I feel so lucky that all doctors and nurses I encountered were so thoughtful and kind. Unfortunately, other experiences with healthcare have been awful to family members when I was there (unkind and/or dismissive) and I didn't know what to expect. However, everyone before, during, and after surgery was kind and made me feel comfortable to ask questions. 

**Anesthesia and Nausea**: Based on my experience with general anesthesia in the past (very minor procedures), it was thought I was higher risk for vomiting. I was given nausea medication (patch) prior to surgery and during surgery. However, post-surgery when I was waking I almost vomited and fainted, so an additional medication was given.

Highly recommend communicating if you think you might be more likely to vomit! Because this involves the abdomen, vomiting can hurt so much more.

In the OR, one experience I had that differed from the past was how I felt. I started to feel as if my heart was racing a bit more and sounds distorting, but was incredibly fatigued and couldn't speak. I was able to keep my eyes open to alert them I was not asleep. Luckily the anesthesia fully kicked in at some point!

**Procedure Itself:**

* Primary incision at bikini line and some very small incisions in the abdomen.
* Procedure itself was 2-3 hours longer than anticipated, unsure why, but all was okay.
* There was only one fibroid, it just happened to be huge. 

**Post-Surgery / In-Hospital Recovery:**

* Waking up, I personally didn't notice super intense pain. I was quite out of it, groggy, and weak, but even now can recall a lot of what was said, and what I said to doctors and nurses (including oversharing) 
* Using the restroom for the first time was unfortunately pretty painful, but after a couple of times it subsided. 
* After some monitoring, I was sent home. Slept a lot.

**Days Following Surgery:**

* **Gas**: Admittedly didn't really experience gas pain.. I think it could be because I was pretty proactive in taking Gas-X and slowly, with help, walked a little bit when I could. 
* **Pain**: On a combo of Tylenol/Advil/Oxy, I had intermittent severe burning pain at the incision site, to the point where I felt clammy, nauseated, like I might faint. Think this started 2-3 days post-op. It wasn't constant, primarily if I was moving and even then not always. Doctor asked to see me to make sure everything was ok. Nothing was wrong, no infection, etc., said the nerves nearby and me having sensitive skin there was likely culprit. This type of pain completely subsided within about a week. 
   * Occasionally stabbing pain in the lower abdomen, tenderness, overall soreness. Now a couple weeks post-op, I still feel some soreness and occasional pain, but nothing like before. 
   * About a week post-op is when I was more able to, with ease, do some household tasks - laundry, heating a simple meal on stove, etc. Still tires me even now, but it isn't horrible. 
* **Showering** was more difficult than I imagined, but this could depend on your water pressure. Standing up and steady requires strength, especially if doing hair, and high water pressure made it more difficult. There was a big difference in how this felt at day 3 vs. day 7, so if it's hard at first, it can be significantly different within a few days. It's still a bit tiring and requires effort, but it isn't terrible and doesn't disrupt my day.
* **Bowel Movement**: I had a small BM within a couple of days, and wasn't great at taking stool softener. I tried prune juice (unsure which day, likely day 3-4) and that was successful, but it did cause the feeling of ongoing stomach rumbling. 
* **Other symptoms**: 
   * Chills, but no fever.
   * Brain fog. This continued even after discontinuing Oxy. 
   * Very low appetite for about 3-4 days. Prepared soups in advance, but even that was too heavy. 
   * Nausea and Vomiting (once). This happened a couple days after surgery. Unsure what ultimately caused it, but may have been not eating enough with pain meds. Doctors then prescribed nausea medication just in case. Every now and again I still get queasy, but nothing serious.
   * Weakness - closing even a coffee maker felt really difficult. This got better within a few days. 
   * Hemoglobin dip after surgery may have caused the chills, brain fog. Doctor said it would naturally climb and within a few days I stopped having those symptoms!
   * Sciatic Pain: started to randomly have sciatic pain about a week and a half post-op. NOT formally diagnosed. Think it may have been a resulted of sleeping upright with wedge pillow for so long. Since moving the wedge pillow to a lower position, it has gotten much better.
* **Present Day:** 
   * Low amounts of pain, mostly soreness and some painful flutters. The flutters are around a 5-6/10 when they happen, but not often.
   * Easily fatigued and sore. This is getting better and better with time, and if I'm not doing a lot, my energy is stable. 
   * My stomach is WAY more flat and I'm not sure I ever recall it being this way, making me wonder even more just how long I've had a fibroid. Truly don't recognize it.
   * No longer experiencing frequent urination. 

**Recommendations for Surgery:** 

* If you can, please try to have someone there as much as they can be. I really thought I'd be good to manage small things after a day or two, but I was wrong. Many others have a better time, but just in case, if you can, try to have someone more present. It helped me immensely to have someone there (including emotionally!)
   * If you think someone can't be there for long, I highly recommend stocking up on frozen items you think you might like once you have an appetite, or consider grocery delivery. When I regained my appetite I wasn't yet feeling up to driving and having some frozen meals ready could be helpful if you find yourself in the same position. 
* If you have a pet, if someone else can care for them, that would be helpful! Doctor was very concerned about pet tugging and what that could do to abdominal muscles/incisions/etc. Also concerns if they jump at you, if you need to pick them up, etc. 
* Wedge Pillow: thanks to this subreddit, I bought a wedge pillow and cannot imagine sleeping post-op without it. It was SO helpful. Even now, it's adjusted to a lower angle and still helps me. 
* Abdominal Binder: also thanks to this subreddit! The hospital supplied mine and I would recommend asking your doctor if they plan to. I know everyone has different experiences with how helpful it is, but I found it so helpful and supportive for about a week. I probably could have taken it off then, but left it on for about a week and a half. It didn't feel great to take it off then, but after a day my body better adjusted.
* Light, quick foods. What I ultimately ended up liking in the first few days included apple sauce pouches, pudding cups, and high-protein yogurts (sometimes). 
* C-Shaped Side Table with Pockets: they sell these on Amazon for about $30. It's small but has a hanging pocket pouch. This was very helpful because I could put necessary small items into the pouches and just grab instead of twisting and reaching into a deep nightstand. If I'd had a nightstand, not sure I would have bought it, but it ended up helping a lot. 
* Heating Pad and Ice Pack: I could have gotten by without them if needed, but it did help me with some discomfort. 
* Gas X: I think this helped with post-op gas pain so definitely recommend.
* Loose Nightgowns: also considered this because of this subreddit! Definitely helped post-op. 
* Dry Shampoo: this is NOT a need, but it did help me since showering was initially pretty difficult. It wasn't about looking a certain way, just hated the feeling of dirty hair. 
* Vomit Bag or Bowel: Hopefully you don't have any post-op vomiting, but if you do, having something there just in case will likely help; it's harder and slower to move post-op and could be difficult to get to a spot to throw up.

1lxc664,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1lxc664/help_me_make_sense_of_how_it_ended/,Help me make sense of how it ended?,"So I’m not usually one for asking for advice on the internet but I’m really struggling to come to terms with how my ex-partner chose to end things. Literally any different perspectives would be appreciated—I apologise preemptively for the wall of text (feel free to skim 😅).

They’ve been in treatment, including DBT, before. Without wanting to force a label on it, their BPD seemed to be more “quiet”/internalised—they struggled with a lot of guilt, shame, and self-destructive behaviours. But they never blew up at me, accused me of anything, … nothing like that. 

It was definitely turbulent from the start—getting used to all of their ups and downs—but it was the happiest I’d felt in a very long time, beginning to end. I really cannot overstate how deeply I loved this person, and how much being with them changed me. I opened up to them in ways I never thought possible, and I felt they did the same with me. 

Yet things got more difficult as time went on and I struggled to put my full trust in them. They were just so inconsistent sometimes. Showering me with love, then suddenly being distant. Not replying to texts for hours on end. Showing up late or not at all for plans we made. Not really listening or remembering things that mattered to me. 

I just didn’t feel like a priority. Like I was separate from the rest of their life. They would say they’d give up anything else for me—their friends, their hobbies, their music. I never would’ve asked them to but when it came down to it, they always seemed to follow their own whims. It made it difficult to trust that they genuinely cared about and wanted to be with me, even though they said I made them so much happier. 

At first I would still address these things, telling them when they did or said something that made me feel insecure. But it was 50/50 on how that would go: they were really understanding sometimes, and would explain to me what was going through their mind. Even if I couldn’t fully empathise, it still helped to hear. They said they had a lot of anxiety around not living up to my expectations. Like they’d feel they didn’t have anything worthwhile to say over text, so they’d get scared to text me at all. They had this mentality that if they couldn’t somehow do everything exactly right for me, then it would all be completely wrong. Sad but at least it felt like something we could work through together. 

But then just as often, if I would try to enforce a boundary or raise even a minor issue, they would completely spiral into guilt and shame. Saying they were an awful person, they hurt everyone, they deserve to be punished. And I’d be the one to comfort them and just drop the subject. 

I didn’t want to see them hurting like that and it was taxing for me as well, so at some point I think I just stopped… speaking up. If they did or said something that hurt me, I’d convince myself it wasn’t that big of a deal. Really I was just letting things pile up and fester until sooner or later the moment came where they’d mess up somehow, and it would all come out of me—and be a complete shock to them. They took it to mean that while they’d thought everything was going great between us, I’d just been quietly miserable the whole time without enough trust to confide in them. This played out similarly three times while we were together. 

The final instance: we had a trip booked to visit my family abroad in April. It wasn’t the first time we’d traveled together and we’d stayed with their family plenty of times. But they were anxious about being around each other for so long. They worried that if they spiralled for whatever reason, they would end up hurting me again. While I appreciated them opening up, they did just kind of leave me to sit with that. It put me on edge too. 

I ended up spending the whole trip trying to make everything right for them, so nothing could possibly destabilise them. That wasn’t my responsibility, they didn’t ask me to, and obviously it didn’t work. For the most part, they were super affectionate towards me and even said it was the best holiday of their whole life. Still, there were moments outside my control that led to them being irritated or completely shutting down, without wanting to tell me if it was something I’d done. 

It just felt like I was giving my all and it still wasn’t enough. I was way too sensitive and I’m really ashamed of how that went. I was the one who kind of shut down over the final two days. I was just so tired and emotional and they couldn’t understand why. We had this pointless argument about how I felt like I was always going along with anything they wanted, and they didn’t seem to care or think about me as much. 

But once we got back from the trip, things seemed back to normal. I did have a lot on my mind that I needed to process—I knew things needed to change. That we needed to communicate differently, and I couldn’t keep trying to take responsibility for their emotions. 

A week after we got back, they visited me for just a few minutes despite being very busy—basically begged to see me, brought me flowers and a drink from our favourite coffee shop. Really sweet. 

Then I didn’t hear from them for a few days. When they came back, they sat me down and told me it was over. They said they’d hurt me too much and might never be good enough for me. They said it didn’t feel worth trying anymore and they were ready to give up. That talking to other people had made them realise things between us had been unhealthy from the start, that emotionally our relationship had always been triggering for them and was just a repetition of patterns from their past relationships. That our insecurities didn’t mix. 

It didn’t matter how I tried to reason, they just stared at me while I cried. Then they proclaimed everything had been said between us and left. I sent them two messages afterwards, from pleading, to trying to empathise, to asking for any sort of actual closure. They never replied. 

Instead, they‘ve been posting on social media about how much everything in their life has been improving, that they love their friends, throwing themselves into music with their band—even shared a video they originally sent to me when we first met, them playing a song from my favourite film, in a “music dump”. Like I never existed. 

I did send them a third message after about a month of no contact which I regret, mostly about how much I miss them and don’t understand what happened, but I also said that I hope they feel like shit for how they ended things. I apologised within minutes of sending it because I felt that way for all of a couple hours—I don’t actually want them to suffer just because I’m suffering. But they texted back “I do care, a lot” and then blocked me. 

So yeah, it’s been over two months now and obviously I’ll never get the answers I want. On a logical level, I know all I can do is take it at face value and move on with my life like they are moving on with theirs. And I’m trying. 

But I miss them terribly and all the uncertainty hurts like hell. I know they feel an almost unbearable amount of shame about how past friendships and relationships of theirs ended. There’s a good chance that “turning it all black” in their mind was the only way they could cope, because dealing with the complexity of the situation and their emotions (and mine) felt impossible. But that doesn’t make it sting less, to feel like it was so easy for them to discard me.

1lxc33e,https://www.reddit.com/r/catcafemap/comments/1lxc33e/where_was_the_worlds_first_cat_cafe/,Where was the World's First Cat Cafe?,"Cat cafes have now become a global phenomenon, offering the typical fare of cafes, but with the added element of a cozier ambiance made possible by the presence of adorable kitties of all kinds. But where did this charming concept originate? The world's first cat cafe opened its doors in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998. Known then as [Cat Flower Garden](https://catcafemap.com/cat-cafe/cafe-cats-dogs), this unique little business set the stage for a worldwide trend that has spread across 50+ countries over the past few decades.

## How did it all start?

The Zhang family often gets credited for starting the world's first cat cafe with **Cat Flower Garden** in 1998. However, the manager, Tracy Zhang, admits that they weren't the first people in the world to have cats in a cafe, they were just the first to get media attention for it. After that, the story spread like wildfire.

In the beginning, they only had five cats, and business was very slow. It wasn't until a local television station did a piece on their business that things really started to take off. These days, the cafe, which is now called ""Cafe Cats & Dogs"" (also known as Kitten Coffee Garden), has had its fair share of animals and their kitty count has gone as high as 20. The count has now settled at 13 cats and 2 dogs, and all the animals are either strays they took in or gifted by friends. Unlike some of the [spots that came after them](https://catcafemap.com/blog/what-is-a-cat-cafe#types-of-cat-cafes), the cats at this cafe aren't available for adoption and simply call it their permanent home.

## So what's the world's first cat cafe like?

The cafe is quite low key, and has a comfy, homey vibe inside. The cats and dogs are often lounging, sleeping, eating, or playing with each other. If your timing is right, you can witness kitty feeding time! However, due to Taiwan's animal protection laws, you aren't allowed to feed the cats, and a member of the staff coordinates feeding time.

The Kitten Garden Cafe is open Wednesday to Monday (closed on Tuesdays and public holidays) from noon to 10pm. You don't need a ticket to enter the Cafe Cats and Dogs, but you must spend a minimum of NT$200 (about $6 USD) in order to stick around and the maximum time you're allowed is two hours.

Unfortunately, the cafe doesn't have WiFi and only accepts cash. The vibe is pretty old school, which makes sense for a business that holds the title of ""world's first cat cafe"". Also, children under 12 are not permitted in the cafe.

## Where exactly is it located?

The cafe is located in Taipei's Shilin district across from Zhishan Station on the MRT Tamsui line. You can [check out their listing here](https://catcafemap.com/cat-cafe/cafe-cats-dogs) for a detailed map, address, description, and social media links.

Inside, there is plenty of seating split across two rooms. Around a dozen small tables for the humans, and kitty cushions and beds for the animals. During the week it can get pretty busy, and on weekends its frequently full which is why the two hour time limit is in place for each party of guests.

## The cats (and dogs) in residence

13 cats and 2 dogs call this cafe home, with the oldest cat being around 15 years old and the youngest born within the last two years. They're all well behaved and don't seem to mine the company of humans, even when things get a little busy.

Most of the kitties meander around the cafe, minding their own business. Some are more inquisitive and approach the patrons for a little attention, but just remember not to feed them! The owners are also pretty stern about other rules like not grabbing/picking up the cats or shining lights on them. These rules are displayed clearly on every table in the cafe.

After more than 25 years of business, many cats have joined the cafe and some have passed on. The walls of the bathroom are adorned with pictures and touching tributes to the cats that have passed away over the years. This cafe is a spot where you can truly feel the pure, and loving intentions that inspired the birth of the cat cafe movement across the world.

Week 2 was smooth. No side effects to speak of. Definitely haven’t been snacking at all, no urge to. I don’t pick at food while I’m cooking, I eat my three meals and just kinda go live. 

My normal day: 
Up around 6, get the kids ready, 2 eggs for breakfast with my pills. 
Drink a couple glasses of water and my daily coffee

Noon: salad with protein, either grilled chicken or shrimp, or leftover taco meat with cauliflower rice. 

Dinner (6ish) protein and a veggie. Nothing crazy. A taco bowl or grilled shrimp on a salad or a salmon burger. 

Two nights a week I’ll play roller hockey (around 6-700 cals a night) 

Probably 3 of the other 5 days I’ll do a 20-30 minute walk which I’ve started adding a 25lb ruck pack to.  I’m not doing anything crazy yet. 

Great progress on the scale and can definitely see some things shifting. No urge to binge or snack, but I definitely feel like I could eat a bigger meal socially if I wanted to. Last weekend definitely had more drinks than I would normally have had dieting, and more BBQ, and this week I’ve had a cocktail a few nights with the wife.

You’ll also find **a keto plan with built-in workout guidance** if you want it. Or not, if you don’t. No one’s yelling at you to do burpees before breakfast.

# 📋 What’s Inside the Plan?

The plan spans 30 days and includes full meal breakdowns, macros, prep instructions, and **a printable keto meal plan you can follow daily**. It even includes a shopping list.

You’re not left wondering how to organize your meals. Everything’s mapped out. You just open the plan, shop once a week, and go about your life.

I liked that it offers **a keto meal generator with macro tracking**, which kept things balanced without turning into a spreadsheet nightmare.

You can also pick snacks, adjust portion sizes, and even plan for days when you’re eating out. Because yes, there’s **a keto diet that includes restaurant meals**, and that alone deserves applause.

# 🧠 Is It Actually Personalized?

Here's the wild part—it is. I’ve used “custom” plans before that were basically PDFs in disguise. KetoCreator was way better than that.

I told it I snack mid-afternoon, don't eat meat, and prefer two meals a day. The plan reflected all of that. It felt like a **custom ketogenic meal plan aligned with my goals** and ethics—not a pre-made list with my name slapped on top.

The meals also took my schedule into account, which helped a lot. There was room for favorites and time-saving meals. You could tell it was **a** [keto schedule that adapts to busy lives](https://theworldhealth.org/keto-creator-official).

# 🔥 Does It Help You Lose Weight?

Short answer: yes, if you stick to it. The plan is based on clean, low-carb eating with high-fat meals that ease your body into ketosis.

Within a week I noticed fewer cravings and more stable energy. My jeans started fitting again, and my mood evened out, which I hadn’t expected.

If you're wondering **how to enter ketosis quickly using food** that doesn’t taste like regret, this plan covers that.

And by week four? You’ll likely see **keto diet results after 30 days** that feel earned, not extreme.

# 👩‍🏫 Who Should Use It?

This is a smart fit for busy professionals, parents, or anyone juggling work and weird schedules.

It’s especially helpful if you’re looking for **a low-carb weight loss plan you can personalize** without needing a degree in nutrition.

It’s also great if you want **a beginner-friendly keto diet with a grocery list** already built in.

My friend Lana (hi Lana!) appreciated that KetoCreator offers **a plan designed for women over 40**. The plan isn’t rigid. It bends with you.

Oh, and if you’re picky? You’ll find **simple keto recipes for picky eaters** that don’t taste like cardboard.

# 🧪 Lana’s Experience (and Mine)

My friend **Lana Ruiz**, who I met through a local hiking group here in SoCal, was actually the one who [nudged me toward KetoCreator](https://theworldhealth.org/keto-creator-official).

She's a high school art teacher, always on her feet, always short on prep time — and after her third staff room bagel breakfast in one week, she’d had enough.

She tried KetoCreator after complaining that every keto plan she downloaded either had her eating bacon five times a day or prepping almond flour pancakes at 6 AM (no thanks).

What caught her eye was how the quiz factored in her energy levels and her school schedule.

She raved about how **the plan was built around a keto schedule that adapts to busy lives**, not the other way around.

Naturally, I had to give it a whirl myself. Like Lana, I was impressed by the simplicity and the way the plan gave me permission to be human.

My meals included easy favorites like vegan chicken lettuce wraps and cauliflower fried rice — stuff I’d actually eat. The only hiccup?

A couple of the recipes linked out to blog pages that felt a little clunky and didn’t list prep times clearly, which made one post-work dinner more stressful than it needed to be.

Still, that tiny inconvenience didn’t take away from how refreshed I felt by week two.

Lana’s still using it, by the way — though she did swap out the green juice week for coffee and scrambled tofu. Fair enough and still healthy!

1lxbzqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/housekeeping/comments/1lxbzqf/on_feedback_and_vacuuming/,On feedback and vacuuming,"We are so grateful to the crew we’ve hired for biweekly cleanings. It has allowed us to bring back balance to our work and family life while caring for our house. I find myself feeling awkward about a situation and I’d love your thoughts. (Big picture: 3br 1.5ba 2000sf, couple rooms we don’t have cleaned. 5 rooms and two hallways essentials including kitchen.)

We’ve hired a company who sends a small crew. I love that this means my own 7+ solo hours cleaning comes back to me this way. While we try to vacate totally, sometimes one of us has to stay back, so we work in an office that we have them skip. We’ve noticed they tend to come and go in a much shorter time than was estimated as corresponds with the hourly estimated charge (spending about an hour it seems). And I don’t really care, if things seem like they are clean, but there will often be missed surfaces, dust over frames, etc. But overall, we are satisfied with the “hard” cleaning done on surfaces. The vacuuming, however, is tough. Here’s more on that.

We have dogs (absent during cleanings), and use a brush vacuum ourselves when we do this ourselves. It helps a lot to pick up fur and dander. But the company likes to use theirs, which I understand is customary. Still, this leaves the carpets (low pile orientals) seemingly unvacuumed, visibly dirty. Yesterday I went through and did it myself after they left and dumped two full canisters. I have been noticing under coffee tables, around furniture legs and other detail-type areas have been untouched. I moved something and saw its imprint surrounded by dust… 

Are my expectations too high and I am too picky? We are not neatniks and I am not doing a white glove test. But there were dust bunnies in an obvious place left for two weeks… (Not meant to be a red flag that our house is a dump- I just mean that for example we have some surfaces with things on them and I don’t worry that they’re not getting cleaned- that clutter is my problem.) I feel awkward asking that there is more time spent properly vacuuming the rugs- this is my main concern. But it seems like… shouldn’t under the coffee table be vacuumed? I would when I was doing myself - and then I ended up spending the time to vacuum the whole house anyway. I feel like this is mostly an equipment issue and a fraction of this is about detail/time. Or is that an above-scope sort of detail I’m best tending myself? We are appreciative and respect the hard work but we’re feeling a little stuck.

Many thanks… ",1,1752252678.0,housekeeping,2,1.0,False
1lxbznh,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1lxbznh/my_coworker_accidentally_put_me_as_her_emergency/,My coworker accidentally put me as her emergency contact and now I’m apparently her emotional support adult,"So this happened like a month ago and honestly, I still don’t know how I feel about it.

I (32F) work in a medium-sized office, mostly remote now but we go in twice a week. Enter Jenna (30ishF), who started a few months back. She’s nice, kinda awkward in a cute way, and we’ve had maybe five total conversations mostly about coffee, cursed printers, and how The Office wouldn’t survive a single HR meeting in real life.

So anyway. I’m halfway through my Thursday when I get a call from an actual hospital. I thought it was a scam call at first until they said Jenna’s full name and that she’d fainted at work and was being taken in.

I was like, “Wait… why are you calling me??”

Turns out I’m listed as her emergency contact.

Cue me panic-scrolling through every convo we’ve ever had in my brain. Was this an accident? A joke? Does she have no one else? Did she mean to put me or was it some dropdown menu autocorrect thing gone rogue?

Either way, guilt kicked in and I ended up driving to the hospital. They wouldn’t let me in at first, but once they confirmed I was on the form, I somehow got ushered into this awkward “not quite family but not not family” waiting room.

Jenna was a little loopy from meds but conscious. She looked at me all happy and said, “Oh! You came. I knew you would. You’re really organized.”

Uhhh???

I asked her nicely if she meant to list me and she goes, “Not really, but you just give responsible energy. I panicked filling out the form.”

SHE. PANICKED.

I sat there while she fell back asleep. Eventually one of her actual friends showed up and I made my escape. Fast forward to now: she’s back at work and acts totally normal… except she now brings me coffee every Thursday and calls me her “emergency contact in spirit.”

And now the office thinks this is hilarious. Someone photoshopped a fake emergency badge with my face on it and taped it to the fridge. Apparently I’m the “Office Mom” now.

I’m honestly torn between feeling flattered and being deeply confused about how I accidentally got adopted by a semi-stranger in her HR paperwork.

Do I gently tell her to pick someone else next time… or just lean into it and start charging consultation fees?

So I (22F) was just out on Church Street today. I was alone. I don’t really have much friends in Bangalore and I’m still kinda new here only. Sometimes I just like walking and seeing places on my own, that’s it.

I was wearing a normal dress okay?? Not churidar or sari or anything aunty like. It was just a sleeved top and a skirt till my knees. Not even short skirt. Only like 1/3 of my leg is visible. And tbh compared to what some other girls were wearing there 😭😭 like full revealing type, crop top and tiny shorts and all, I was literally looking so decent pls.

So anyway I was just walking and chilling, and this guy came and started talking to me. He looked kinda nice. Like okay looking, 30-35 age, had that tech guy who works in Koramangala but acts softboy type vibe. But he was polite, respectful and all. I’m not gonna explain why he started talking, but he was being nice and friendly.

Then we started walking together, randomly chatting about Bangalore and cafes and all, and he offered to buy me Starbucks. And I don’t know why but I said yes. 😭 Bit foolish of me but ya I did take the coffee.

So like after 15–20 mins, we still talking and sipping coffee. Everything was fine. Until this ONE MOMENT.

He suddenly comes little close to me and goes like, “Okay, this is gonna sound strange, but can you do me a favour?”

And I was like... “Uhh how weird is weird?”

And then. This man. Actually opens his Starbucks cup... looks at me seriously and says:

“Can you spit in it?”

I thought I misheard. I was like wtf. So I literally asked him “Wait wait… did you just say you want me to SPIT in your coffee???”

And he just nods 😭😭 Like nods so casual, like he asking for extra sugar or something.

WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE BRO.

I was so shocked I just stared at him. Then I said “No” obv. I stood up and was about to walk away. And then this guy legit goes:

“I’ll give you ₹1000 if you do it.”

I swear to god. Thousand rupees to spit in his coffee.

I just ran. I RAN to the metro station like my life depended on it. But now I’m sitting here thinking... did I just miss the easiest thousand rupees of my life?? 😭😭

It’s just spit no? I didn’t even have to touch him. Didn’t even have to look at him after. Just one pichak and walk away. I kinda regret not taking it??? 😭

Is this how Bangalore is now? Like is this normal?? Someone please confirm I’m not going mad.

Edit: stop coming into my DMs and saying you would send money if I spit.. you guys are worse ☠️😭",94,1752252595.0,Coconaad,88,0.87,False

1lxbui8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxbui8,French Avenue Pinnace ✦ The Holiday Inn of Summer Scents,"**My scent this morning. Already a memory—just like my coffee buzz.**

I tested this one from a 1ml spray decant, and I’ll say it up front—I’ve never smelled Louis Vuitton Pacific Chill, which this is supposedly duping. That said, Pinnace gives off a clean, citrusy burst that feels tailor-made for hot summer mornings and plastic beach chairs. Picture a grapefruit in sunglasses, lounging poolside at the Holiday Inn. It opens with sharp lemon, grapefruit, and a dab of mint, with a few flirty blackcurrant peeks now and then. Fresh? Absolutely. Deep and interesting? Ehh, not so much.

The drydown barely changes—it’s like someone pressed repeat on the opening notes. There’s no creamy fig, no warm apricot, no twist. This doesn’t sail into yacht territory—it’s more Carnival Cruise “fun ship” energy. I wouldn’t wear it to impress a yacht crew... unless that crew was wearing tank tops and sipping bottomless piña coladas. Still, it’s got a place: it’s cheery, chill, and perfect for guys who feel 22, even if their knees say otherwise.

Is it pleasant? Yeah. But not “drop nearly 50 bucks” pleasant. This one won’t be making my Fragrantica wish list anytime soon. I’m more curious about Afnan Rare Reef, which supposedly packs some real depth—think apricot, fig, and maybe a date or two. Pinnace just feels like the appetizer without the dipping sauce. Light, fun, and easygoing—but honestly, it’s really geared for the under-28 crowd who had to decide between this and their Chipotle run.

1lxbsiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1lxbsiq/can_the_ge_jvm3160dfww_overtherange_microwave/,Can the GE JVM3160DFWW Over-the-Range Microwave Meet Your Needs?,"The GE JVM3160DFWW has been a staple in my kitchen for a while now, and I’ve tested it extensively in my daily routines. From quick reheats of coffee to defrosting stubbornly frozen chicken breasts, it has held up impressively under constant use. This over-the-range microwave is perfect for busy households that prioritize convenience and simplicity without splurging on a high-end appliance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The clean, white finish of this appliance integrates nicely with most kitchen aesthetics, especially if you’ve got a lighter-toned kitchen. The dimensions (15.25 x 29.88 x 16.5 inches) make it fit neatly above standard stovetops, and I found the installation process relatively easy for an over-the-range model. Its 1.6 cubic feet capacity is plenty large, though I sometimes find myself wishing for a slightly deeper cavity when reheating oversized dishes. What stands out is the minimalist control console, featuring responsive electronic touch controls that aren’t cluttered or overwhelming. A small gripe I’ve noticed is the turntable—it does its job fine, but larger dishes sometimes push its limits.

**Ease of Use**  
Cooking and reheating with this microwave is a breeze. The convenience cooking controls feel intuitive, requiring no manual-reading marathons to get the hang of things. For instance, the “Add 30 Seconds” button has quickly become my best friend during rushed mornings! The Auto and Time Defrost options are particularly handy for someone like me who rarely plans meals ahead (read: regularly forgets to take the meat out of the freezer). The variety of presets for different foods is functional, though it could potentially confuse a first-time user if they’re not already familiar with similar settings.

**Cooking Power and Features**  
Equipped with 1000 watts of power, this microwave heats food evenly and pretty quickly. My oatmeal, for example, is ready within two minutes, and soups come out steaming hot without cold patches. Not to mention, the two-speed, 300-CFM venting system is a game-changer. Unlike the flimsy vents on some similar models I’ve tried, this one actually manages to tackle cooking odors effectively, keeping my kitchen smelling fresh even after frying bacon. I appreciate the Turntable On/Off function too, as it allows me to opt for a static platform when using irregularly shaped dishes.

**Key Benefits**  
- The venting system is robust and practical for dealing with cooking smoke and odors.  
- Auto and Time Defrost features offer flexibility for meal prep.  
- Sleek design that complements most kitchens.  
- Cooking power of 1000 watts ensures consistent and even results.

[See GE JVM3160DFWW deals on Amazon now.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b00ymdk074/)

**Energy Efficiency and Noise Levels**  
In terms of energy consumption, this unit is on par with similar models I’ve used at 1000 watts. It doesn’t eat up a scary amount of electricity, which I find reassuring for long-term use. On the noise front, while it isn’t whisper-quiet, it’s definitely not obnoxious. The hum during operation is pretty standard and normal for a microwave of this capacity. Even the vent fan, despite being powerful, isn’t distractingly loud, which is a plus when I’ve got company over and I need to heat snacks without drowning out the conversation.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The turntable struggles with oversized dishes, especially rectangular containers.  
- The design could include softer-closing doors; the current one shuts with a bit more force than I'd like.  
- The light under the microwave works great but feels dim for some cooking situations.

**Performance Compared to Market Rivals**  
I’ve tested other over-the-range microwaves like the Whirlpool WMH31017HS and Samsung ME16K3000AS in the past, and each has its strengths. Where the GE JVM3160DFWW really stands out is its venting system—it outperforms the Samsung in odor control, making it a top choice for those who cook with lots of spices or smokey recipes. On the other hand, the Whirlpool offers a sleeker, more high-tech appearance but lacks some of the practical convenience features like the “Add 30 Seconds” button that I adore on the GE model. Both competitors also don’t match the simplicity and reliability of the GE model’s cooking controls, which are perfect for everyday users who appreciate ease of use.

**Value for Money**  
It’s worth considering the price point here. For an appliance under constant use, the GE JVM3160DFWW delivers excellent reliability and features at a reasonable cost. Sure, it doesn’t have the flashiness of higher-end models, but it performs consistently without unnecessary bells and whistles. In my opinion, it strikes a fine balance between affordability and utility, making it a smart purchase for most households. Spending more might get you additional features, but for most of us, this microwave does everything you'd truly need.

Hey y’all,

It rained last night. I love the rain. It helped me sleep. I actually accidently fell asleep on the couch lol

It’s been a minute. Life lately has felt like one of those silent film montages where the house is flooding, the bills are flying, and that meme coffee dog character is just sipping tea in the middle of the chaos trying to stay composed. That’s me. I’m the the coffee dog. The tea is cold.

I’m still living with Will who continues to be a walking hug in human form. He’s been working his butt off, covering the bills, never complains. He makes good money for a guy kn his own, not so much wkth my dead weight. But after the recent storm tore up part of the property and gave his car a new ""ventilation feature,"" I’ve noticed the stress creeping in. He hasn’t said a word, but you know that kind of silence that says everything? I know him. Maybe better than myself...he would never ever say anything to me to make me feel like I'm draining him but I can tell. It would be a huge relief if I got an actual job. Not a contract that's temporary but a real actual stable full-time job.

Meanwhile, I’ve been job hunting *like* it’s my full-time job—except without benefits or pay or being able to tell your boyfriend not to worry as you can help. Rejection emails are stacking up like crazy, and it’s hard not to feel like a human paperweight. I know I’m not useless, but depression likes to argue and today the bitch is winning.

Add in some ongoing (very draining, can’t-talk-about-it-yet) legal drama from your favorite sperm donor and evil but better looking twon, and I’ve been stuck in a loop...Feel like a burden ->Job hunt harder
->Get rejected->Feel worse->Spiral->Will notices and worries->Feel guilty he noticed a.s now is worried->Repeat until so upset I drink a bottle of wine on the living room floor at 2am rewatching Stargate SG1 season 3. 

Sorry that was specific lol my point is I know this spiral. I recognize it. I know what it is. And none of that makes it easier to break out of. I do make him lunch and dinner and help tidy, get packages etc but I'm no housewife. I'm messy and cluttered snd hoard random shit. I keep looking for a remote or hybrid job so I can focus on my mental health and keeping the house from falling into a depressive hellhole and keep an eye on the dogs etc.

Sunny’s in the middle of a move. Zoe’s out in Kerrville helping with the flood relief (bless her, seriously - so on brand for her). So I’ve been kind of white-knuckling my emotions and trying to make it all look effortless. 0 out of 10 I would not recommend.

I keep thinking about finding a low/no-cost remote therapist again. Haven’t actually done it. It’s on my to-do list… right between “make dentist appointment” and “become emotionally stable.” tbh lol

Tonight might help though—my new friend Alana’s in a play, and I’m going to see it. Will thinks I should join her theatre club, which is cute because he thinks I still have social energy left in the tank. But I might. We’ll see. Maybe I need a little spotlight therapy. Or at least be around weird theatre kids to feel that kinship

Anyway, if you’re also in a weird place between “grateful” and “deeply overwhelmed,” hi. I see you. I’m there too. Here’s to breathing through it.

Love,
Trouble 💛

**You know the order by heart: venti, iced, extra caramel. But what happens when you take that beloved latte abroad? In the sun-soaked cafés of the Mediterranean, coffee culture tells a different story. Stronger, shorter, and often with no syrup in sight. This playful guide explores how your go-to drink might raise eyebrows (or smiles) in Italy, Greece, France, Turkey, and Spain, and what the locals are actually drinking instead. Spoiler: it probably doesn’t come with a straw.**

You’ve finally arrived. You’ve stepped off the plane, hair sticking to your forehead, the sun kissing your shoulders, the scent of sea salt and sunscreen in the air, and you think, “This is it. My Mediterranean summer.”

Naturally, you stride up to the nearest café, sunglasses perched confidently, and say:

“*Hi, can I get an iced vanilla oat milk latte with sugar-free caramel syrup and extra ice, please?”*

Pause.

You notice the barista’s smile freeze, eyes flicker, and a soft, confused “Scusi?” escapes their lips.

  
That, my dears, is the precise moment your local neighbors are laughing at your coffee order – and **it’s not out of meanness**. **It’s out of a quiet, knowing humor that in this part of the world, coffee is not just coffee.**

1lxbpdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lxbpdb/does_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_truly_suit/,Does the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Truly Suit Small Spaces?,"I’ve been using the Keurig K-Mini for a few weeks now, and as someone who needs coffee to function in the morning, the experience has been quite the rollercoaster. This sleek little machine has earned a permanent spot on my kitchen counter—for now at least. Its slim design, measuring less than 5 inches wide, is honestly a lifesaver in my tiny apartment kitchen where counter space doesn’t just grow on trees. I often joke that my kitchen is the size of a closet, but this coffee maker fits perfectly and still leaves room for my cutting board. The matte black finish gives it a modern, no-nonsense vibe that doesn’t scream “cheap coffee machine,” which I appreciate more than I expected. 

**Ease of Use for Non-Morning People**  
The one-button operation is a godsend for bleary-eyed individuals like me who can barely function before the first sip of caffeine. All you have to do is fill the one-cup reservoir with fresh water, pop in a K-Cup pod, and press the button. The machine does the rest. Simple as that. I didn’t realize how much I’d value that minimalism until I found myself half-asleep, struggling to brew. However, if you need a bigger reservoir—sorry, you’re out of luck. The one-cup max can feel a bit restrictive if your mornings involve multiple caffeine runs.

[Check Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Energy Efficient or Just Convenient?**  
One feature that caught my attention is the auto-off function, which turns the machine off 90 seconds after brewing. This might not seem like a big deal until you realize how often we tend to forget to hit the off switch rushing out the door. It’s also an energy-saver for those perpetually on the go, reducing any guilt over leaving appliances plugged in all day.

**Travel Mug Flexibility**  
I’m someone who often takes coffee on the go, and I was relieved to find that the removable drip tray accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall. This is a small but thoughtful addition, especially for commuters. It also holds accidental spills, which saved me one chaotic morning after I misjudged the cup size. Let’s say cleaning up an overflowing coffee mess was not how I planned to start my day, but at least the tray prevented a complete disaster.

**Advantages**  
Several elements stood out during my time with this single-serve coffee machine:  
- Compact size makes it perfect for small spaces like dorms, apartments, and offices.  
- Brews coffee quickly and efficiently—perfect for busy mornings.  
- The cord storage system keeps countertops tidy.  
- Compatible with reusable coffee filters if you want to brew your own ground coffee.  

**Shortcomings**  
That said, not everything is rainbows and butterflies:  
- Limited to a single cup reservoir; larger batches aren’t an option.  
- No temperature control, so customization is pretty limited.  
- Doesn’t have a built-in clock or digital display for extra convenience.  
- Can’t froth milk or cater to more complex coffee creations.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this machine to similarly compact models like the Nespresso Essenza Mini, the Keurig K-Mini focuses more on providing variety through K-Cup pods. On the other hand, the Nespresso leverages its espresso pods for richer, creamier coffee. While both appeal to those with tight spaces and quick-morning routines, the Nespresso’s milk frother attachment option is something the Keurig can’t touch. Coming in at a slightly lower price point, the Keurig feels friendlier to budget-conscious shoppers or those who prefer basic coffee options without much fuss. However, if you’re all about crafting latte art or espresso-based drinks, you might find the Keurig lacking.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Honestly, for its feature set and convenience, the Keurig K-Mini offers solid value for small-space dwellers or anyone seeking simplicity in their coffee routine. It’s not trying to be anything more than what it is—a straightforward single-serve brewer that gets the job done. The price aligns well with its capabilities, especially given the brand's reputation for durability and dependability in the affordable coffee maker segment.

With $WKSP coiled just under the $5 technical trigger, three potential headlines loom that could turn Sunday night scrolls into Monday morning squeezes:

1. Fleet KPI Update: Rumors suggest the 1,000-truck pilot phase is done. A Saturday AM drop would dominate EV blogs and fleet Twitter before Monday even opens.
2. Dealer Network Confirmation: Whisper count is \~620 doors. If that gets confirmed in a Sunday PM PR, it validates revenue scalability - and telegraphs Q3 upside.
3. NASCAR Partnership Tease: Race circuits live for Monday AM headlines ahead of the next weekend. Even a “strategic discussion” announcement could send algos scrambling.

Each of these has a history of appearing after-hours or premarket when liquidity is thin—exactly when low-float stocks move hardest. WKSP has under 5M tradable shares and sits inches below a $5.03–$5.54 gap that chart traders have circled for weeks.

I’ve topped off a starter swing, stop tight below $3.96, but I’m letting the weekend cycle play out. Seen too many tickers get re-rated before Monday coffee. This might be another. High risk? Yes. But optionality like this rarely stays cheap. NFA.

1lxbjse,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1lxbjse/how_i_cured_my_insomnia/,How I cured my insomnia,"I’m a 42 yo male, married with 2 kids both under 10. I started having poor sleep a few years ago. It was generally manageable with coffee and an occasional nap. Then in 2025, with a lot of stuff going on at work, I started not sleeping at all. It was full blown insomnia and I developed an anxiety about sleeping, which exacerbated the insomnia. I tried multiple OTC sleep aids and prescription sleep aids but nothing worked.
 
Fast forward 6 months later and I discovered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). I was skeptical of CBT at first but then I read about one of the basic first steps, which had less to do with your psychological state of mind and more to do with your physical state. Specifically, it’s called your “sleep drive”, which is your body’s natural ability to fall asleep because it physically needs to. Out of options, I tried it, and within 4 days I’m now sleeping again. I wish I had known about this 6 months ago and it’s why I am sharing it with all of you that may be suffering. Here are the basic steps you have to take:
 
7-Day Sleep Reset Plan
 
 
Goal: Retrain your brain to associate bed with sleep, increase sleep pressure, and reset circadian timing — without medication.
 
Before You Start
Pick a fixed wake-up time (e.g. 6:30 AM) and stick to it every day, even on weekends.
Remove clocks from view at night. No checking the time.
No naps, even if you’re exhausted.
 
 
Daily Plan
 
Day 1–2: Limit Time in Bed to Rebuild Sleep Drive
 
Set a “sleep window” = your average total sleep time (estimate 5–6 hrs to start). Example: If wake time is 6:30 AM → bedtime = 1:00 AM
Go to bed only when truly sleepy, not just tired.
Get out of bed if you can’t sleep after ~20 min — go to another room, read something boring, and return only when sleepy.
 
Do NOT lie in bed trying to sleep. That reinforces insomnia.
 
 
Day 3–4: Keep Pressure On, Even If You’re Tired
 
Stick to the wake-up time no matter how little sleep you got.
If you feel tired earlier in the evening, resist sleeping before your window.
You should start to feel sleepier around your new bedtime — this is natural sleep pressure building.
 
 
Day 5–6: Gradually Expand Sleep Window (If Sleep Improves)
 
If you’re falling asleep within 20–30 min and not waking much, expand your sleep window by 15 minutes (e.g. 12:45 AM–6:30 AM).
Only increase further if your sleep efficiency (time asleep ÷ time in bed) is ≥85%.
 
Day 7: Evaluate
 
How often did you fall asleep faster?
Are mornings less groggy?
If you’re still struggling, keep the same schedule for another week before expanding.
 
 
Bonus Tools:
 
Morning light: Get 15–30 min of sunlight within 1 hour of waking to reinforce circadian rhythm.
Evening wind-down: Stop screens, news, and intense conversations 1 hour before bed.
Body scan or progressive muscle relaxation (YouTube/Headspace) before bed to downshift your nervous system.
 
Red Flags to Avoid:
 
Using bed for podcasts, phones, or just “trying” to sleep
Sleeping in or canceling morning activities
Clock-checking in the night
Taking sleep meds randomly",3,1752251641.0,insomnia,6,0.62,False

1lxbdby,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1lxbdby/bicyclefriendly_cafés_in_taipei_and_taiwan/,Bicycle-friendly cafés in Taipei and Taiwan,"I've been keeping an eye out for what I'd consider 'bicycle friendly' cafés around Taipei, where I live, and while I've found one or two it would be great to know if anyone knows of any others. If you know of others outside of Taipei, feel free to throw them in in case anyone else comes looking for recommendations elsewhere in Taiwan. But I'm hoping there might be places I've missed while google searching.

The main criteria are: easy parking for your bicycle, and being able to see the bike from inside at all times. While Taipei has a reputation for being very safe, when it comes to keeping an eye on my bicycle (I'm from the UK), old habits die hard, and my bike was expensive.

The best so far: Feed Zone in Wenshan District. It's a bike shop/café. Very open and airy, with very good coffee and food. It has a balcony area where I can easily wheel my bike up (there's a ramp) and be able to see it from inside the café at all times. The windows are ground to floor. Even better, it's very close to the riverside bicycle paths, which means, depending on where in the city you are, you can probably get there while staying mostly off the roads. 

The runner-up I've been to is the Rapha Taipei shop. But: it's bang in the heart of Taipei, so you have to navigate some very busy streets to get there. Positives: the coffee shop section is a large enclosed area where your bike feels secure. One major drawback: the coffee shop section is open to the air. You get all the heat and humidity of summer in Taiwan. It's probably fine in early spring and late Autumn, but the rest of the time, you'd be baked alive. 

That's the only ones I've been to so far that come anywhere near hitting the target. There are others I'm considering, but haven't been to yet - Mommouth up toward Bali District, and also next to the riverside paths, and TokyoBike, in Taipei, but also not too far, I think, from the paths. 

If anyone has recommendations for places that meet similar criteria, let me know. ",1,1752251237.0,cycling,0,1.0,False

My mom started going out all the time, like several nights a week, getting home late at night. I started seeing her less and less due to my school and sports obligations. I never even met the guy until February 2025, and my brothers only met him a few weeks ago at a very awkward dinner. 
Then around that time, I started noticing some differences in my mom. She started wearing dresses around the house where before she only wore workout clothes. Then, one day when she wore a tight-fitting shirt, I noticed she had gained a lot of weight. Her stomach looked rounder and her chest looked a little bigger. I started to think - is she pregnant? I brought this up to my middle brother and he said he’d noticed it too, and that she’d also stopped drinking coffee in the mornings. My mom has also always been super skinny. As long as I can remember, she has never been this big before, even when my siblings and I were very young. She also started pressuring us to get ready to move and sell the house (something she’s talked about on and off since the divorce began but very suddenly became more interested in). 
I want to ask her if she’s pregnant, but our relationship is already kind of rocky. Long story short, I almost moved in with my dad a couple weeks ago, and she got so upset that I actually moved back in with her out of concern for her mental health. 
I go to college this fall, should I just bite the bullet and ask her? Is there any way for me to tell? Im pretty sure she stops getting alimony from my dad if she is pregnant, but she would never abort - she had me out of wedlock at 19 and tells me all the time she would’ve never gotten rid of me. However, if she stops getting alimony, she will be in a bad financial state, because she’s a high school teacher and has to support 3 kids and pay a mortgage.
I also don’t even know if she’s mentally fit to have a child - she has a really bad temper and screams and yells at us constantly over the smallest things. 
Should I tell my mom to have this kid if she is pregnant? How am I gonna have a sibling 19 years younger than me? Any advice on how to deal with this will be helpful. Next week my youngest brother and I are going to go on a vacation with Joe and his kids and my mom, so I don’t want to ask her in front of them. But I also just want to know.

1lxbapq,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1lxbapq/hangover_migraine/,Hangover Migraine,"So basically, i got food poisoning, or a stomach bug about three weeks ago June 20-22 2025 . And then i was fine for about 6-7Days. But on June 29 i was falling asleep like normal. And i go to close my eyes and i get heart palpitations for about 3-5 Seconds, it goes away but then i get this rush into my head and I immediately feel Hungover. It’s one of the scariest feelings I’ve ever had tbh. Well since then its now been 12 Days and i still feel “Hungover”. I feel dizzy, confused, disoriented, and in a euphoric state almost. Been drinking lots of water, eating healthier. Tryna get more sleep. I should mention that the week i got better from the food poisoning on that weekend, I did drink alcohol. Got pretty buzzed, and had a total of 3-5 Sodas in those two days with coffee in the morning both days as well. I know terrible, and honestly stupid, because I don’t know what I was thinking putting all of that into my system just when i had started to recover. 

So my question is this a result of all that and why im getting this insane migraine? Did I basically nuke my digestive system and now i have to wait weeks to recover and deal with this Migrane? 

I will mention that i do have high blood pressure. And my last readings where 140-150. 
But prior to all of this, like 3-4 months ago it was normal at 120/80. So I think the increase is due to the anxiety and stress from the migrane.

I used to be a frequent Vaper, but have decided to go cold turkey on that. I have not been drinking caffeine either for about two weeks.

Im currently a bit overweight, coming in at 213, where i should be at 180. For being 25, And 5’9. Working on that as well. 

Also any and all advice to help this migraine to go away well be very appreciated.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it. 



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn’t get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I’d driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it. 



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn’t get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I’d driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.

I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.

I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it. 



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn’t get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I’d driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it.

It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing.

The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly.

The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well.

A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I’d driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it. 



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn’t get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again?

Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it. 



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn’t get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I’d driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

I sipped my coffee and stared at the half-finished page in the mouth of my old Underwood.



Three days, three days, and this was what I had to show for it. 



I put my head in my hands and leaned back in the squeaky old office chair that had been here when I arrived. I couldn’t get my mind on my work today and that was a big problem. I had rented the cabin for two weeks, two weeks of bliss away from screaming children and honey-do lists, and now I was three days deep with nothing to show for it but three paragraphs and writer's block. Smooth jazz caressed me from the speakers of the little CD player I had brought, but today its chords might as well have been breaking glass. The wind blew outside, kicking up leaves against the glass, and as the jazz played on I heard it again.



There was something else under the surface of that jangling wind, the rattling sound that had been breaking my concentration for the past three days.



A maddening, almost skeletal sound that wouldn't stop.



I turned back to my work but within minutes I had stopped again. The story was supposed to be about...what the hell was the story supposed to be about again? A horror writer in the woods or something cliche like that? It had all seemed so well put together when I’d driven up here three days ago. A writer in the woods, writing his stories while something supernatural lurks around him, making his stories come to life. I tapped absentmindedly at the keys for a few more minutes before I growled and yanked the paper out of the Underwood, throwing it in the garbage can.

The Underwood was a vanity, and I knew it. I owned three computers, one a very nice and very expensive Macbook, but I used the Underwood because it made me feel like a professional. Someone had told me, at a convention or a book signing or something, that real writers used typewriters. So I went out and paid an excessive amount of money for this ancient engine of destruction. It took a lot of money to keep this golem up and running but I paid it, toting this heavy old thing around in a case that was half as expensive as it had been, and felt that my writing was better for it.



It would not have shocked me to learn that many writers had similar totems.



The wind scuttled through the trees again and this time I jumped when the leaves spattered against the window. It sounded like someone throwing a fistful of rocks against the glass, but that wasn't what had surprised me. I had been listening for that clattering sound, the almost musical knocking that sounded so familiar, and the sounds of the skeletal leaves had caught me off guard. I cursed as I pulled the half-started sheet and threw it away. I had laid across the keyboard in my panic and now it was ruined. I drew another sheet down into the guts of the old contraption and began to write again, getting a little further this time and as I sipped coffee, becoming quite happy with the results.



*The mountain path ran up and up and up as he scaled the climb and made his way to the cabin near its top. The snow lay like delicate lace upon the ground and the tires of his Dodge Charger crunched into the snow as he*



I stopped. A Charger? The writer hadn't had a Charger in any other writing I’d done. The Charger was mine, a big black brute that now hunkered outside the cabin I was wasting time in. What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there.

What had the writer been driving? He couldn't have gotten a Charger up here in the snow anyway. The car was great for highways and gravel roads, but snow and hills would have left it parked and waiting for more favorable conditions. I considered leaving it, but it just wouldn't do. I dragged out my correction tape and changed it to a Jeep instead.



Still, I wished the writer could experience the bliss of owning something I had wanted since I was a kid.



The car out front had been a present, a reward for good service, which hadn't stopped my wife from bitching about it at all.



“Really? A muscle car? That's so like you, Derrick. Leave it to you to publish a book and have a midlife crisis all in the same week.”



She didn't get it though. This had been a reward when my first novel had sold five hundred thousand copies. I’d paid cash for it on the lot, and felt like somewhere in my past, a twelve-year-old version of myself was grinning and pumping his fist. My old man had wanted a Charger, and had talked longingly about getting one anytime he saw one, but he had been a welder for a rinky-dink construction outfit and had disdained books almost as much as he disdained his “poof” of a son for writing them.



Well, now Dad was in the ground, and look who was screaming down the road in a Charger.



I changed my mind again, the car stayed, and changed it again before moving on.



*pulled his bags from the car and walked to the cabin. Two weeks of peace and quiet to finish his book, two weeks of just him and his old typewriter in the picturesque cabin. Going up had been an adventure, but going down again could be suicide, and he only meant to tempt fate once. For better or worse, he was up here for two weeks. He had enough food, smokes, whiskey, and toilet paper for fourteen days, and if it ran out then he supposed he would have to do without. His editor said this new book had to be ready before October or he might as well shelve it forever, and he meant to have it ready.*



I nodded as I took the sheet off the typewriter, liking where this was going. The writer was at the cabin now, that was a start, now I just had to get the rest of it. I wished my editor had told me I only had two weeks to write my latest mediocre piece of trash. My editor was a nice guy, but he was definitely more than a little spineless. He was more than willing to wheedle and kiss ass when what I really needed was a good boot in the backside. A deadline or an ultimatum might have motivated me more than what I actually had going on. It hadn't been deadlines but due dates that pushed me to get this on paper. The car was paid off, but the house was still a work in progress, and the money from his first book was beginning to run dry. This cabin had been an expense that I didn't really have, but if it birthed another book then I suppose it was worth it.



The wind hit the side of the house again and I heard those unsettling wind chimes bang together for the thousandth time. I couldn't figure out where they were. I hadn't seen any wind chimes when I came in, or I would have taken them down after the first night. At first, they had been a little interesting, but as time passed they became downright grating. They were different from any chimes I had ever heard. It didn't sound metal, but it didn't sound wooden either. It sounded hollow, kind of like the leaves that kept rattling against the glass, and the first night they had woken me up more than once.



When I did sleep, it had come into my dreams and the dreams would have made a good book all on their own.



Someone knocked and I jerked a little as I went to see who it was. I was honestly a little glad for the distraction, ready to chalk this whole thing up to a wash the longer it went on. It seemed like I was honestly just looking for a reason to take breaks and I worried I wouldn't have anything to prop up the cost of this trip. My wife was going to have a fit, very likely, but I think the bigger disappointment would be that I didn't have a book for her to proofread. Melinda had loved Fiest, my first book, and it had held us together through some of the rougher times. She, not my editor, had pushed me to finish it, and I had seen her read the battered old hard copy I had gotten her for Christmas a lot during our marriage.



That was why I had to finish this one so desperately.



I needed to remind her that I could still be the man she had fallen in love with.



The man on the other side of the door seemed relieved when he saw me, and I opened it with what I hoped was a friendly greeting. James had been hesitant to rent me the cabin, despite the good weather we'd been having, and it had taken a little coaxing to get the story out of him. We had been corresponding for about a month before he let me make a reservation, and the first night here, after a couple of handles of good whiskey, he had told me the reason. It appeared I wasn't the only one who had rented the place to get some work done, and the last guy had left him holding the bag in more ways than one.



""I came to check on him pretty regularly, but one day he just wasn't here. His truck was here, his stuff was here, but he was just gone. They never found him, but I keep looking for him when I go on my hikes sometimes.""



He didn't seem to like the sound of the weird wind chimes either, and he couldn't tell me what the sound was.



""Hey,"" he said, his smile only slightly worried, ""just coming to make sure you didn't need anything. I brought some wood too, they say there might be some blow-up tonight and I didn't want you to freeze up here.""



I looked outside, craning my neck up as if expecting to see the words **SNOW** written in the sky by some huge hand.



""In September?"" I asked, thinking he must be joking.



He shrugged, ""It happens some years. The weather here is temperamental. So, do you need anything?""



I shook my head, ""I think I'm all set. I've got enough supplies for a month at least.""



That had been by design. Once I came up here I didn't want to do anything but write and sleep and exist. Clearly, I was making a botch of one of those things, but this guy didn't need to know that.



He nodded, ""Well, if you need anything, let me know. I've got an old snowmobile if you get stuck up here, but I don't think it will be that bad. Your car looks heavy enough to make it down even if it snowed a foot of powder.""



I nodded, resisting the urge to tell him it was a Charger, and we parted ways.



I gave it another half hour in front of the Underwood before shaking my head and going to get the whiskey I had brought with me.



Sometimes great writing needed a little lubricant. All the great writers knew that, that was why most of them had been drunks. A couple of handles in and I was ready to write. I got back to work as the sun set behind the smeary windows. As I walked the writer through setting up, however, I must have hit a head of steam because I started really banging it out as afternoon stretched into evening. I had a couple more glasses of whiskey and as the paper got harder and harder to see, I found the pages were stacking up. The rattling kept right on coming, but I was too drunk to care. The juices were flowing and when I slipped sideways halfway into my sixth or seventh glass, I saw something hitting the windows as I passed out.



They were small, the white flakes looking very wet as they slapped against the glass and slid sideways. I hadn't really had a lot of experience with snow, but I remembered something like this from when I was a kid. The snow hadn't stuck, but I had laid in bed watching it hit the window as my nightlight had thrown soft light across the glass. I lay there in a stupor and remembered that, and when the wind chimes came again, hollow and ethereal, I remembered something else.

I remembered watching something on TV, a fivetet of dancing skeletons as they wiggled and wobbled in the Autumn air. Somehow, I imagined that the sound I heard would be like that. The sound of hollow bones banging against each other would make a sound like that, but the more I tried to fix on it, the foggier the dream became. Finally, as my drunken dreams usually did, I was suddenly awake and I had traveled through time to a new place and a new when.



I was shivering on the floor of the cabin, the inside suddenly very chilly and the snow against the windows making the inside shadowy. It was sometime in the mid-morning, after dawn but before lunch, and the drift was up over the lip of the window. I guess it had been more than a few inches, and as I staggered to my feet, I looked out and saw that my Charger was covered in snow up to the door handle. Jesus, it had to have dumped three feet overnight! Luckily I had wood and bottled water so I got myself a drink to cut the sharp edge of my hangover and got a fire going in the fireplace. As the snow rattled against the window and the hollow chimes continued to clang together, I sat down to look over what I had written.



For drunken ramblings, it was pretty good. They were mostly on topic too, all of them laying out the strange sound that kept assaulting the writer as he worked. This wasn't the direction I had intended to go in, but I liked what my drunken self had put down about it.



*""He sat at the keys, fingers ready for battle, but as they went to work he heard a sound as it scraped across his nerves. It was a hollow clunking, the sound of old, plastic bottles falling downstairs, and as the wind outside pushed at the house insistently, the sound continued. It was a mystery at first, something he chased, but soon it would become maddening.""*



This was pretty good, I reflected. The writer went looking for the sound, but couldn't seem to find anything. There were no chimes on the porch, front or back, and there were none hanging from the eaves. He checked the ragged trees around the house and even looked under the porch, but he couldn't find anything. There were no wind chimes anywhere, and that was when he noticed the window.



""Window?"" I said, flipping the page, ""What window?""



This story had taken a turn I hadn't planned on, and now he was talking about windows. The cabin he was in was supposed to be a single story, no upstairs to have a window. Of course, I hadn't meant to give the guy a Charger either and now he had one. The story was taking on a mystery feel, and I found that I liked it. I sat back down to write, feeding more paper in, but as I clicked away at the keys, I found that the threads just wouldn't come. It wasn't the story I had in mind and now it was going off into uncharted waters. I tore a few pages out and tossed them, grunting as the light cut into my vision, and by noon I was looking at the half-empty bottle again.



Maybe a little of the old inspiration could be found in its depths.



Three shots later, I was off again. The window was important. There was someone in the window, he could see them, but he didn't know how to get there. There were no stairs, no way for anyone to get up there, so how were they there? I took another shot and kept writing. Suddenly, the cabin I was in and the cabin I was writing about were one and the same. There was a stranger in the cabin, someone lurking in the walls, and the writer felt like if he didn't find them then they would surely drive him crazy. They were the one making the noise, they were responsible for the hollow chimes, and if he wanted to keep his sanity, then the writer needed to find them.

#           

I passed out again that night, waking up in the morning with an even nastier hangover and about twenty pages of new material.



I could get used to this whole getting drunk and waking up with pages deal.

The writer had continued his own book, a book within a book, but his mind kept wandering to that person in the upper story. He had called the realtor he had rented the place from, but the man had assured him that the window was aesthetic, there was nothing up there. The writer didn't believe him and reflected on a story the man had told him about another writer who had gone missing in the house, a writer who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances.



*""He had been working on his novel, a long mystery that he seemed to be making progress on when he suddenly vanished. His truck was here, his things were here, but he was gone. I searched for him, but there was no sign. He kept a journal and the journal talked a lot about strange sounds he heard when the wind blew. It was the rattling, hollow clatter of chimes and the writer became quite mad."" The realtor said he had found holes in the walls where the man had gone searching for them, and he had charged the man's estate for the damage in his absence.*



I hoped the guy who had rented me the cabin wouldn't mind that I borrowed his story, but it was really coming along now. I had some idea where it was going, and one look outside told me I wasn't going anywhere. The snow was up on the porch now, and I had to force the door open to go and check on a theory. As the house in the story became the house I was staying in, at least in my mind, I wanted to see if there was a window out there. Maybe I was working elements of real life into my tale, and as I tromped through the snow, I was a little relieved to see that there was no window over the porch. The roof rose into an upside-down V and though there might be an attic up there somewhere, it wasn't big enough for a room.



I started to go back inside, but something told me to walk around a little bit.



I had made a full circuit of the house and was heading back to the front porch when my foot came down on something and sent me sprawling. It had been small and slippery, the object rolling out treacherously as I tumbled and as I lay there in the snow, I looked up and found the window.



It was round, not a bay window like I had told about in the story, and, as I squinted, I thought I could see something up there.



It was subtle, a dark outline, but it was definitely person-shaped.  



I reached down into the snow to see if I could find what I had slipped on and came up with a cracked, but still intact, shot glass. The idea that I had come out here before the snow was very deep seemed to make sense. I had come out here while I was drunk and looked at this window and that was why it had stuck so fast in my head. I had seen it, seen the person-shaped shadow and my mind had started running. It had been like that with Fiest, too. I had seen something, a little dog hunting ground squirrels one afternoon, and my mind had raced along like one of those little squirrels.



I spent the next three days writing, drinking, and nursing my pounding head in the morning.



By the end of the first week, I had my story but not my ending.  



The snow didn't melt, but it didn't grow anymore after that night. It froze into tightly packed little hillock and my expeditions outside were very chilly. I could have driven through it if I needed to get out, but going down the mountain with three feet of snow on the ground would be suicide. The radio had said the snow would melt before it was time to leave, so I took it as a sign to keep writing.



The writer, my writer, had found the journal of the writer that had gone missing. It was hidden behind some books in the reading nook of the cabin and he had immersed himself in the man's ramblings. The writer was being slowly driven crazy by the sounds of the wind chimes, but he believed they were talking to him as well. They wanted to be found, they wanted to tell him a great secret, and as he searched for the secrets of the cabin, so did I.



I started looking for a way into the attic. It had to be somewhere, but the house was devoid of any of the usual loft entrances I was used to seeing. There were no ceiling entranced, no pull-down stairs, and as my time began to wane, I thought of something I hadn't. Taking a leaf from the Scoobie Doo notebook, I started looking for secret entrances. The book had ground to a halt, the writer stuck trying to find his own way into the secret room, but I figured once I discovered the source of the wind chimes, I would have my ending too.



I was starting to consider making some holes in the walls myself when I noticed something I should have seen right away. By the reading nook, there was a portion of the ceiling that was curved. It curved up, the rest of the ceiling being mostly flat, but it was enough to notice that this would be the most obvious place for a stairway. I started moving the bookcases, sliding them to the side as I looked for the source, and was rewarded with a doorway. It was so seamless that I could believe that no one had found it. Maybe even the guy who had rented it to me had known about it, though that seemed like a stretch. The doorway squalled on its rusty hinges as it came open and I took the stairs slowly and deliberately. If someone was up there then they would have surely heard me, but I suppose they already knew I was down there. As I came to the top, I froze as a person-shape came into view.



They were standing about a foot from the window, just staring in the direction of the muted light, and the longer I looked, the more I realized they weren't standing. The person would have had a hard time standing, especially in their condition. They moved ever so slightly as the wind came in through the eaves and as it did, I heard the hollow sound of the chimes. They swayed to and fro, their bones held together with the thinnest of tendons, and some of the bones on the ground showed that they had been falling apart as time went by.



I closed the hatch and called the man who had rented the cabin to me.



I had to let him know that I had found the writer.



Turned out I would be leaving on time, but I'd have to finish the book at home. The police had a lot of questions, as did the guy I rented the cabin from. For starters, he was unaware that the place had an attic. He had inherited it from his Uncle and had done little but rent it out for the last five years. When the guy had disappeared in it last year, he had just assumed he had wandered off into the woods, but it appeared the writer had discovered the secret passage and how to close it behind him. They had found the writer's screenplay in the attic, along with his body, the body was what I had been hearing all this time.



He was little more than forearms, leg bones, and ribcage now, but his body had deteriorated until his bones were being held together by the thinnest of cartilage and skin. No one knew why he had decided to hang himself up there, he hadn't left a journal like the missing writer in my story, but he had a history of anti-depressants and mental health issues. The owner of the cabin said he was glad to have finally found him, but I think I'll end my book a little differently.



Even as I drive down the mountain, I can see the ending of the book coming together.



The writer discovers a secret room where the realtor hides the bodies of the writers whose stories he steals, and the writer manages to fight him off before he becomes his latest victim.



Should be a good ending and a great story for the book circuit after I publish it.



It isn't every day you get to be part of a real-life mystery.

Sorry in advance for the long post!

For reference, I am about 5'6 and weight around 265 lbs. I desperately want and need to lose weight, not just for my body image but also for my joints and over all health. I'm not looking to be super thin either, I want to get down to 180/150 lbs. I want to be healthier, but healthy food is so goddamned expensive, and we (my bf and I) struggle with money because I can't work. We do live with my parents, but want to move out when we can. I have a lot of health struggles, but the big ones are POTS, hEDS, arthritis, interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder, and chronic fatigue syndrome. I *struggle* with energy during the day, and I do have ADHD and take concerta/methylphenidate. It helps with focus but not energy. And while Adderall did help with energy, I hated taking it because of the anxiety and jitters like I drank a liter of coffee. 

I also do struggle with body dysmorphia and self esteem/body image. To make a long story short, bullies and ""friends"" wrecked me mentally and I have lasting issues from it. However I honestly just want to be able to do the things I enjoy and wanna be and feel more confident in my own body. 

As for things I've tried to do to lose weight? I've tried diets (keto, Mediterranean, Atkins, general calorie counting, etc), exercise, physical therapy... Nothing worked, I developed EDNOS, and exercise makes my symptoms so much worse, even the physical therapy exercises. I try my best to go on walks or hikes, or go swimming, but with my health being the way it's been, I often am laying in bed a lot of the day because everything hurts or makes me dizzy/symptomatic as hell. I also do watch what I eat and try to make meals at home when I can. I do have doctors appointments to address some of my symptoms (pots and overactive bladder/interstitial cystitis) but I feel like I can't talk to doctors about this because they always tell me to diet and exercise, but I CAN'T ANYMORE, AND IT DOESNT WORK! I don't know what else to do, and I'm at the end of my damn rope with these ""doctors"". I don't necessarily want weight loss meds either, I just want some options other than the things I've been trying since I was 12 that have not worked or made things worse.

If anyone is willing to offer advice or help, I would be extremely grateful. I'm struggling with this a lot and want to make a change for the better.",1,1752250721.0,POTS,3,1.0,False
