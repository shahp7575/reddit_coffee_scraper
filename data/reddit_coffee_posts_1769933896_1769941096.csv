( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Newcastle Race 1 - 14:10

DAILEY FAMILY FUNERALS CLASS 1 & MAIDEN PLATE

2200m TURF GOOD 4

**In-Depth Form Analysis for Every Horse**

**1. CALL ME SON (4yo Gelding, 59.0kg, BP 7, Trainer: David Pfeiffer, Jockey: Regan Bayliss)**

Recent form: 5x143 (last start 3rd at Gosford 2100m CL1, 1.4L off winner in 2:10.39, settled 2nd throughout and tried hard but peaked late). Prior win at Canberra 1400m MDN (strong late surge after midfield). Lightly raced with scope from The Autumn Sun pedigree (sire suited to staying). Blinkers on recently helped focus. 24 days fresh, 4th-up now peaking. Strong at 2100m last start with good sectional (37.37 L600m). Suited Good 4, no issue with track/distance. Barrier 7 workable. Key strength: proven stayer form, recent placing against similar depth. Weakness: yet to win beyond 1400m but building. Projected: major player if repeats Gosford effort.

**2. TEA OR COFFEE (7yo Gelding, 59.0kg, BP 3, Trainer: Ben Blay, Jockey: Ella Drew a2)**

Recent form: 55455 (consistent but no wins in long time; last start 5th Gunnedah 1600m CL1, picked up late from back). Best recent 1815m 5th (stuck on okay). Snitzel sire but dam line not strong for 2200m. Aged now, 7th-up, may be tiring late. Barrier 3 suits sit off speed. Good 4 ok historically. Strength: honest trier, can plug away. Weakness: no staying form, recent margins large, lacks class edge here. Projected: likely outclassed over trip.

**3. GOLDEN SMILE (6yo Mare, 57.0kg, BP 6, Trainer: Kris Lees, Jockey: Andrew Gibbons)**

Recent form: 62230 (strong recent staying efforts: 3rd Newcastle 2100m CL1 beaten 0.5L, 2nd Newcastle 2100m beaten 0.4L, 2nd Newcastle 1900m beaten 1.1L; led or sat prominent). Sea The Stars pedigree excellent for distance. Multiple placings at track/distance combo. 17 days fresh, 6th-up. Blinkers off previously but form solid. Strength: proven at 2100m+ here, strong front-running ability, consistent. Weakness: recent sharper drop-out when wide/pressure applied. Projected: clear top chance on local staying form.

**4. PRO VELOCITY (4yo Mare, 57.0kg, BP 8, Trainer: Brad Widdup, Jockey: Christian Reith)**

Recent form: 15345 (last start 5th Wyong 1625m CL1, big late from back beaten 1.2L; prior 4th Orange 1600m held up). Proisir mare with staying scope. Win at 1400m but closing style suits longer. 8 days fresh, sharp. Blinkers positive previously. Strength: progressive, strong late splits, improving. Weakness: yet to place at 2000m+, wide draw challenge. Projected: danger if gets cover and strong finish.

**5. BABYFACED ASSASSIN (4yo Gelding, 56.5kg, BP 2, Trainer: Gary Portelli, Jockey: Ashley Morgan)**

Recent form: 27642 (last start 2nd Nowra 2200m CL1 beaten 0.2L after settling back). Multiple placings at 2000m+. I Am Invincible but showing staying ability. Blinkers on. 33 days fresh. Strength: recent 2200m effort strong, inside draw helps. Weakness: maiden, inconsistent starts. Projected: each-way hope if repeats Nowra.

**6. ROYSTON (4yo Gelding, 56.5kg, BP 1, Trainer: Mick Price & Michael Kent Jnr, Jockey: Andrew Adkins)**

Recent form: 47x48 (maiden, last start 8th Nowra 1600m well back). Dundeel pedigree suited to trip. Trials fair. 33 days fresh. Barrier 1 ideal. Strength: upside lightly raced, rail helps. Weakness: no wins/placings, recent form modest. Projected: rough hope at best.

**7. TAKETHEMONEYANDRUN (4yo Gelding, 56.5kg, BP 4, Trainer: Gavin Groth, Jockey: Leanne Boyd a2)**

Recent form: 33l23 (consistent placings 1400-1600m, 3rd Tamworth 1600m beaten 2.9L). Capitalist but unproven over 2200m. Blinkers on. Strength: honest, recent minor placings. Weakness: no staying proof, likely outstayed. Projected: struggle late.

**8. LA MORRA (3yo Filly, 55.5kg, BP 9, Trainer: John P Thompson, Jockey: Brock Ryan)**

Recent form: 4x871 (recent win Kembla 1500m MDN, got up late). Toronado filly with upside. 23 days fresh, 4th-up. Strength: recent win, weight advantage, potential to improve. Weakness: unproven at trip, wide draw. Projected: could surprise if adapts.

**9. ICON DREAM (5yo Mare, 55.0kg, BP 5, Trainer: Matthew Smith, Jockey: Alysha Collett)**

Recent form: 53402 (last start 2nd Gosford 2100m CL1 beaten 0.6L, strong finish; prior 10th Newcastle 2100m). Prized Icon mare staying type. Visors on last start positive. 24 days fresh. Strength: recent strong 2100m placing vs Call Me Son. Weakness: long win drought, can be inconsistent. Projected: live each-way.

**Race Preview**

This 2200m Class 1 & Maiden Plate at Newcastle (Beaumont track) on Good 4 with +2m rail looks a genuine staying test over the trip. Pace should be moderate with no dominant speed, allowing on-pace runners to hold up and closers to get a shot late. The track typically plays fair here, with little bias expected on Good 4 (small Soft 5 risk unlikely to change dynamics much).

The standout is **Golden Smile**, who has been ultra-consistent at this track over 1900-2100m recently, with placings including narrow defeats at 2100m in similar company. Her ability to lead or sit prominent, combined with Sea The Stars staying pedigree and Kris Lees' strike rate in these, makes her perfectly suited. She should control or sit close from barrier 6 and prove hard to run down.

**Call Me Son** is the clear danger after a solid 3rd at Gosford 2100m last start (held position and fought on), showing improvement 4th-up with blinkers. His Autumn Sun breeding adds scope, and recent sectional strength suggests he can sustain over the trip.

**Icon Dream** has hidden merit, running 2nd at Gosford 2100m last start (beaten 0.6L after good run), and she beat Call Me Son home there. Visors helped focus; she can be prominent and fight out the finish again.

**Pro Velocity** brings progressive form and strong late closing (recent Wyong 5th from back), while **Babyfaced Assassin** has the best recent staying effort (narrow 2nd Nowra 2200m). Both can threaten if the leaders overdo it.

**La Morra** is the wildcard as a lightly raced 3yo filly off a recent 1500m win, with scope to stretch out. The remainder (Tea or Coffee, Royston, Takethemoneyandrun) lack the class or staying proof to seriously contend against this depth, though Tea or Coffee can plug away for minor money. Expect a genuine staying contest where fitness, positioning, and late strength decide it. (Word count: 348)

**Top 4-6 Predicted Contenders**

* **3 Golden Smile** — Proven at track/distance, consistent placings, ideal setup.
* **1 Call Me Son** — Recent 2100m placing, building 4th-up, strong merit.
* **9 Icon Dream** — Fresh 2100m 2nd, beat some key rivals, visors positive.
* **4 Pro Velocity** — Progressive closer, sharp fresh, late strength.
* **5 Babyfaced Assassin** — Recent 2200m narrow 2nd, inside draw helps.
* **8 La Morra** — Upside filly off win, weight advantage if stretches.

# Newcastle Race 2



Newcastle Race 2 - THE ADVISER COLLECTIVE MAIDEN PLATE (1350m, Good 4, Rail +2m)

**In-Depth Form Analysis for Every Horse**

(Only active runners assessed; scratched/emergencies noted but not analysed in depth if not running. Scratched: 2,5,6,9,13)

1. **EL QASABI (4yo G, 59.0kg, BP 4, Regan Bayliss / David Pfieffer)** Consistent recent placer with strong suitability to the distance/step-up. Recent 2nd at Wyong over 1200m (beaten 1.7L) showed good closing sectional (34.62 L600m) from back, knuckled down late despite wide run. Prior 5th at Kembla (1000m, soft) lame post-race but forgiven on firmer ground. Earlier 3rd at Wyong (1100m) with keen early but even finish. Trial win prior to resuming. Lightly raced (0-4-6), improving pattern (5x352), suits 1350m progression. Trainer/jockey combo solid. Strong chance if settles better from gate 4.
2. **AMALFI COAST (3yo C, 58.5kg, BP 7, Zac Wadick / G Waterhouse & A Bott)** Debutant from elite stable (high strike-rate). $500k yearling by Written Tycoon out of Fastnet Rock mare. Recent trials mixed but latest 3rd at Warwick Farm (1200m, soft) respectable margin (0.87L). Earlier trials show speed flashes. Waterhouse/Bott debutants often well-prepared and sharp first-up. Barrier 7 requires luck, but class edge and pedigree suit 1350m. Watch market closely.
3. **GOD SAVE THE KING (3yo C, 58.5kg, BP 9, Winona Costin / G Waterhouse & A Bott)** Another high-class debutant ($775k yearling by King's Legacy). Dominant recent trial win at Warwick Farm (1200m, soft) by 5L, strong time. Earlier trials okay but latest sharp. Stable's strike-rate with 3yo colts excellent. Wide barrier (9) challenge on debut, but raw talent and fitness suggest big showing if handles run-on style.
4. **STERN DISPUTE (3yo G, 58.5kg, BP 13, Kris Lees)** First-up run solid 3rd at Gosford (1200m, soft) beaten 4.8L after keen run and bumping, closed okay late. Recent trials sharp (2nd/2nd/1st). Lees 3yo maidens often improve second-up. Wide draw (13) tough, but tongue-tie first-up helped settle. Pedigree scope for further.
5. **IVY LEGEND (4yo M, 57.0kg, BP 11, Lee Magorrian / Chris Waller)** Long break (235 days), last prep fair 4th at Gosford (1600m, soft) from midfield. Trials recent but moderate. Waller barn improving runners post-break, but wide gate and lay-off query suitability first-up at 1350m.
6. **APERITAS (3yo F, 56.5kg, BP 10, Keagan Latham / Michael Freedman)** Recent form 45, 5th at Kembla (1300m) after check (forgive), prior 4th Gosford (1200m) honest from back. Trial win prior. Freedman/Latham combo strong. Wide draw (10) but closing style suits if pace hot.
7. **ODAKA (3yo F, 56.5kg, BP 8, Andrew Gibbons / Kris Lees)** Strong recent 2nd Taree (1400m) beaten 1.8L after leading and fighting on. Prior 4th Newcastle (1350m) held up, 3rd Hawkesbury (1100m) good late. Consistent (4x342), suits track/distance. Blinkers helped last start. Major player.
8. **REVENUE RAISER (3yo F, 56.5kg, BP 5, Louis-Philippe Beuzelin / Fabio Martino)** Mixed recent 9th Cowra (poor wide run), but prior 2nd Gilgandra (good late) and 5th Newcastle (big late from back). Improving, suits 1350m. Gate 5 helps.
9. **SHARE THE JOY (6yo M, 57.0kg, BP 6)** Veteran maiden with volume of placings (0-11-31). Recent 3rd Kembla (1200m) even, prior consistent minor placings. Drops in grade, suits track, but lacks killer edge.
10. **EASY TRAPEZEE (3yo G, 58.5kg, BP 2)** Poor debut 10th Newcastle (1350m, soft) well beaten. Trials modest. Low chance.
11. **LOVE GODDESS (3yo F, 56.5kg, BP 3, Mollie Fitzgerald / Kylie Gavenlock)** Recent 7th Gosford (1200m) even from midfield. Prior okay efforts but no wins. Pedigree okay, but form modest.
12. **RADIANT TIER (3yo F, 56.5kg, BP 12)** Poor debut 9th Gosford (1200m) no impact. Trials fair. Wide draw hurts.
13. **I WANT THIS (4yo G, 59.0kg, BP 1)** Recent poor 9th Taree, 7th Newcastle. Long break prior, low form. Rail helps but unlikely.

**Race Preview**

This 1350m maiden features a blend of consistent improvers and high-profile debutants from powerful stables. The rail +2m and Good 4 rating should suit even-paced races with little bias expected. Pace likely set by forward types like Odaka (who led and fought on last start) or El Qasabi if aggressive early, with plenty of closers ready to pounce if hot tempo develops. Key strength lies in recent form over similar trips: El Qasabi's Wyong 2nd (strong late) and Odaka's Taree 2nd (tough on speed) stand out for reliability. Aperitas adds depth with honest efforts despite checks. The Waterhouse/Bott duo (Amalfi Coast and God Save The King) bring serious debut upside—big-money yearlings with sharp trials and stable intent often dominate these. Stern Dispute can improve second-up for Lees. Wide draws for several (including Stern Dispute, Ivy Legend) may require luck, while inside gates for El Qasabi and Share The Joy aid positioning. Fitness edges to exposed runners; debutants appear ready. Overall competitive heat with multiple winning hopes—expect strong finish from 300m-100m. (348 words)

**Top 4-6 Predicted Contenders**

* **1. EL QASABI** — Consistent placer, strong recent 2nd, suits step-up, good gate.
* **11. ODAKA** — Proven at track/distance, tough recent 2nd leading, blinkers help.
* **4. GOD SAVE THE KING** — Elite trial win, high-pedigree debutant, stable strike-rate.
* **3. AMALFI COAST** — Sharp recent trial, powerful stable debut, class edge.
* **10. APERITAS** — Honest recent efforts, closing style suits if pace on.
* **7. STERN DISPUTE** — Solid first-up, Lees 3yo improver, trial form.

# Newcastle Race 3



Newcastle Race 3 - Sharp Office Maiden Handicap (1200m, Good 4, Rail +2m)

**In-Depth Form Analysis for Every Horse**

**1. Cada Estrella (59.5kg, BP 3, Aaron Bullock / Patrick Cleave)**

3yo Zoustar gelding with strong pedigree (Zoustar x I Am Invincible dam). Debut run 15 days ago at Armidale over 1100m (Soft 6) where he finished a close 2nd (0.2L) in a maiden handicap. Settled 2nd throughout, took narrow lead in straight but just failed to hold off winner. Showed good gate speed despite awkward beginning, fought hard late. Winkers went on for that run. Prior trials were average (midfield or worse finishes), but race day improvement was clear. Fresh up here (15 days), drawn well in 3, top jockey (Bullock) with strong trainer combo stats. Suited to 1200m progression, handles Good/Soft. Clear top chance on exposed form and merit.

**2. Good'n'You (59.5kg, BP 1, Mitchell Bell / Gerald Ryan & Sterling Alexiou)**

3yo Graff gelding. Single run 18 days ago at Newcastle over 1200m (Soft 6) where he finished 3rd (1.6L). Settled 3rd, improved to 2nd at turn, worked home solidly but couldn't quicken past leaders in suited frontrunner tempo. Blinkers and surgical shoes on debut. Good trial form leading in (consistent placings). Drawn barrier 1 ideal for positioning. Trainer in strong form, jockey solid. Proven at track/distance, handles conditions. Strong each-way player with natural pace advantage.

**3. Bugatte (58.5kg, BP 5, Lee Magorrian / Chris Waller)**

3yo Written By colt. Only run 110 days ago at Warwick Farm 1200m (Good 4) in strong Inglis Ready2Race Plate (Class 3 MDN level), finished 6th (3L). Settled midfield, held position but only battled late in frontrunner-suited race. Recent trials fair (4th twice). Long break, first-up now. Pedigree suggests speed (Written By x Snitzel dam). Waller stable capable of improving types, but lacks exposed recent form. Needs to show more.

**4. Fat Barry (58.5kg, BP 8, Kristen Buchanan)**

3yo Brazen Beau gelding on debut. Recent trials modest (5th 1000m Beaumont, 4th 845m Wyong). Pedigree has speed elements (Brazen Beau x Not A Single Doubt dam). Trainer consistent with debutants, but no standout trial markers. Wide draw (8), unknown quantity at this level. Needs to show natural ability.

**8. Chispa (56.5kg, BP 2, Ashley Morgan / Chris Waller)**

3yo Savabeel filly on debut. Recent trials average (7th, 6th, 5th, 5th, 7th over shorter trips). Pedigree stamina-oriented (Savabeel x Galileo dam), but trials suggest may need further. Waller runner, good jockey, barrier 2 helps. Unknown at 1200m debut, likely to improve but lacks trial punch.

**9. Elegant Force (56.5kg, BP 9, Andrew Gibbons / Kris Lees)**

3yo Brutal filly. Two runs: 4th (3.1L) Wyong 1200m (Soft) 7 months ago from wide barrier, kept finding late after settling back. Then 10th (7L) Taree 1250m (Soft) 21 days ago, led early but weakened badly (blundered 800m, post-race gait issue noted). Blinkers on last start. Trials mixed (win 800m, 5th 1000m). Wide draw, needs to bounce back.

**10. Nothing Finer (56.5kg, BP 7, Alysha Collett / Joseph Pride)**

3yo King's Legacy gelding. Two runs: 7th (6.9L) Hawkesbury 1000m, slow begin and no impact. Then 5th (8L) Goulburn 1100m, solid late from back half. Long break (129 days), recent trials poor (8th, 9th). Light weight helps, but form lacks punch.

**11. Lucky Me (55.5kg, BP 4, Keagan Latham / Peter Snowden)**

3yo Zousain filly. Two runs: 4th (3L) Goulburn 1100m, settled back but failed to finish off. Then 11th (9.7L) Kembla 1300m, keen/raced wide-ish, no late kick. Trials fair (3rd 1150m). Weight advantage, but needs to settle better.

**14. Cool Themis (55.0kg, BP 6, Mitchell & Desiree Kearney)**

3yo Cool Aza Beel filly. Three runs, all poor: 8th Newcastle 1200m (13L), 12th Bathurst 1400m (10.7L), recent 8th Bathurst 1200m (12.3L). Slow starts, no impact. Trials average. Light weight, but form well beaten.

Scratched: 5, 6, 7, 12, 13 (not assessed).

**Race Preview**

This 1200m maiden handicap at Newcastle (Beaumont) looks a competitive affair with several horses showing promise on limited exposure. The +2m rail and Good 4 rating should suit on-pace types, with little obvious bias expected unless rain arrives (small Soft 5 risk). Pace should be moderate, favoring those drawn inside who can hold position early.

Cada Estrella stands out as the clear horse to beat. His debut 2nd at Armidale was eye-catching—he overcame an awkward start, sat prominent, led briefly in the straight, and only went down narrowly. The step to 1200m suits, he has Bullock aboard (strong combo), and the short 15-day freshen is ideal. Good'n'You is the main danger after a solid 3rd here over this track/distance 18 days ago. He settled well, worked home strongly, and barrier 1 plus blinkers should see him prominent again. The Ryan/Alexiou stable is in form, and he maps to sit close.

Bugatte brings class via his strong Warwick Farm debut in a hot maiden (6th beaten 3L), but the long break raises fitness questions despite recent trials. Elegant Force has placed form (4th Wyong) but bombed last start (gait issue noted)—if she rebounds with blinkers retained, she could surprise, though wide draw hurts. Chispa and Fat Barry are debutants with Waller/Buchanan backing, but trials lack wow factor. The remainder (Nothing Finer, Lucky Me, Cool Themis) have been beaten too far or lack consistency to challenge strongly. Expect an on-pace dominated race, with merit favoring exposed recent placings over unproven types. Depth is moderate, but top two look hardest to beat. (378 words)

**Top Predicted Contenders**

1. Cada Estrella – Strong debut 2nd, suits step up, ideal draw/jockey, clear top pick.
2. Good'n'You – Proven here over 1200m, barrier 1, solid trial form, major threat.
3. Bugatte – Classy pedigree, strong debut in tougher race, Waller improvement potential.
4. Elegant Force – Prior placing form, blinkers help, value if she handles draw.
5. Chispa – Debut with upside, good barrier, could surprise if sharp.

NEW ZEALAND BLOODSTOCK COUNTRY BOOSTED MAIDEN PLATE

1150m TURF GOOD 4

**In-Depth Form Analysis for Every Horse**

**1. ALREADY BLUE (4yo G, BP 7, 59.0kg, J: William Stanley, T: Julia Presits)**

Current form shows consistent recent efforts in maidens over 1000-1200m. Best run was 2nd at Taree (1000m, Good 4) on 2 Jan 2026, beaten 2L after racing wide without cover throughout and trying hard late. Prior to that, 8th at Tamworth (1200m) 11 days ago where he led but faded (blinkers on first time, now off). Earlier 8th at Taree (1000m, Soft 6) after travelling greenly. Debut 6th at Hawkesbury (1100m) was checked mid-race. Lightly raced with scope as a Blue Point gelding from a More Than Ready dam line (speed and early zip likely). Suited to 1150m, drawn wide but has shown he can handle pressure. Trainer modest strike rate, jockey average. Recent runs indicate improving fitness (4th-up). Track/trip suitable on Good 4. Strengths: recent placing, speed to be forward. Weaknesses: wide draw, tendency to fade when leading. Projected: competitive if settles closer.

**2. CIVILIAN (3yo C, BP 5, 58.5kg, J: Shannen Llewellyn, T: Jeremy Sylvester)**

Debut runner. No race form. Trial history mixed: recent Muswellbrook trial 8th (900m, Soft), beaten 7.5L; earlier Randwick trials poor (6th-7th). Previous trainer Chris Waller trials also unconvincing. By Wootton Bassett out of I Am Invincible mare (suggests speed but unproven). Trainer modest stats, jockey low rating. No barrier trial wins or strong sectionals noted. First-up, unknown how he handles race pressure. Drawn midfield. Strengths: young with potential pedigree upside. Weaknesses: no public form, poor trial margins. Projected: needs to show more than trials suggest to contend.

**3. ARABIAN MELODY (6yo M, BP 2, 57.0kg, J: Grace Palmer (a4), T: John Bannister)**

Long absence (867 days since last run). Last prep (2023) showed promise with 3rd at Bendigo (1100m, Soft 6) racing wide and working home, then 7th at Swan Hill (1200m) after leading but fading. Recent trials solid: 2nd at Beaumont (1000m) beaten 0.28L, 5th at Gunnedah. By Pride of Dubai from Danehill Dancer dam (endurance and class hints). Jockey claim helps, trainer low volume but recent trial form encouraging. Draw ideal (gate 2) for forward run. First-up after long break, but trials suggest fitness ok. Track/trip suits past efforts. Strengths: placed form previously, good draw, recent trial second. Weaknesses: lengthy layoff, age. Projected: sharp trial form makes her a danger if she handles fresh.

**4. GYRA (4yo M, BP 6, 57.0kg, J: Billy Cray, T: Nikki Pollock)**

Recent 4th at Gosford (1200m, Soft 7) 16 days ago, wide without cover but held ground ok. Prior runs longer (1300-1620m) with moderate results (3rd Kembla Grange 1300m, then poor over further). Overshare mare suggests speed suits shorter. Tongue tie off last run. Trial 3rd Tamworth recent. Trainer modest, jockey ok. Drawn midfield-wide. Strengths: recent closer effort, drops back in trip. Weaknesses: mixed longer form, wide draw. Projected: better at this trip, each-way hope.

**5. MARKWELL MELODY (4yo M, BP 3, 57.0kg, J: Reece Jones, T: Joseph Burges)**

Poor recent form: 8th Taree 1300m (hung out), 6th Tuncurry 1000m (buffeted late), 10th/9th earlier. Overshare from Lonhro dam (pedigree ok for speed). No placings in 5 starts, mostly well beaten. Trainer low strike rate. Draw good (3). Strengths: barrier, possible improver. Weaknesses: consistent poor finishes, no form lines. Projected: unlikely to threaten major players.

**6. RADIO GA GA (6yo M, BP 1, 57.0kg, J: Kacie Adams, T: Iain Marks)**

Recent 9th Taree 1250m (6L+), keen early. Long prior spell after poor debut-ish run. Trial win Taree recent (1000m). Derryn mare, limited upside shown. Draw rail excellent. Trainer low stats. Strengths: inside gate, recent trial win. Weaknesses: poor race form, big margins. Projected: needs huge improvement.

**7. SHOW US YA TEXTS (4yo M, BP 4, 57.0kg, J: TBA, T: Lyle Chandler)**

Long break (179 days). Recent runs 5th Tamworth 1400m, 5th Coonabarabran 1600m (led but tired), 5th Dubbo 1300m (slow start). Showtime mare, consistent but no wins/placings. Trainer strong country strike rate. Draw ok. Strengths: trainer in form, consistent finishing. Weaknesses: no strong wins, break. Projected: place hope at best.

**8. FLYING TRUFFLES (3yo F, BP 8, 56.5kg, J: Ashley Morgan, T: Brett & Georgie Cavanough)**

Debut runner. Limited trial: 3rd Beaudesert (1050m). Flying Artie filly (speedy type). Strong trainer combo (high strike rates), top jockey. Wide draw challenge. Strengths: trainer/jockey strength, young scope. Weaknesses: wide barrier, unknown race manners. Projected: strong debut chance.

**Race Preview**

This 1150m maiden at Newcastle (Beaumont) on Good 4 with +2m rail looks open but with several key form lines. Speed should come from inside-drawn horses like RADIO GA GA (gate 1) and ARABIAN MELODY (gate 2), with ALREADY BLUE (wide but speedy) and FLYING TRUFFLES possibly pushing forward. Pace likely genuine, suiting on-pace types or strong finishers. The standout recent form belongs to ALREADY BLUE with his Taree 2nd (beaten 2L after wide run), showing he can be competitive in similar maidens. ARABIAN MELODY returns from a long break but sharp trials (2nd Beaumont 1000m close) and ideal draw make her dangerous if she repeats. FLYING TRUFFLES is the interesting debutant for a trainer/jockey team in excellent touch (high recent strike rates), and despite the wide gate, pedigree and connections suggest natural speed and upside. GYRA's recent Gosford 4th (wide but held on) indicates she can improve dropping back to 1150m. CIVILIAN (debut) and MARKWELL MELODY lack compelling form, while RADIO GA GA and SHOW US YA TEXTS have limited claims based on past runs and trials. Condition appears Good 4 firm, no major bias expected on Beaumont with rail +2m (usually fair). Fitness edges to exposed runners, but fresh ones with trials can surprise. Overall depth moderate, but top chances have clear claims on recent efforts or connections. Expect a race where early position is key, with strong late bids possible from midfield. (378 words)

**Top 4-6 Predicted Contenders**

* **8. FLYING TRUFFLES** — Strong trainer/jockey combo, debut upside, speed from pedigree.
* **3. ARABIAN MELODY** — Sharp recent trials, ideal draw, placed form before break.
* **1. ALREADY BLUE** — Best recent placing (2nd Taree), forward pattern suits.
* **4. GYRA** — Recent 4th Gosford, trip drop helps, each-way value.
* **7. SHOW US YA TEXTS** — Trainer form, consistent, possible improver.
* **2. CIVILIAN** — Debut potential but unproven.

​I’m a Spanish fiber optic technician currently working for a German telecom company. I’ve been living here for about 9 months, so please excuse me for writing this in English as my German is still a work in progress!

​I’ve been working across several regions like Baden-Württemberg, Niedersachsen, and Nordrhein-Westfalen. I’ve noticed something interesting: quite often, customers offer me a tip after I finish the job (usually under €20).
​To be honest, I’m not complaining, it’s been great for my grocery budget and helps me save my main salary.

​Sometimes I feel a bit guilty or embarrassed accepting it, especially when the fix is something simple like replacing an internal cable or re-splicing a fiber inside the house. It feels like ""just part of the job,"" yet they insist.

​So, I was wondering if:

1. ​Is it culturally ""expected"" or just a nice gesture to tip technicians? Like I said, I'm coming from Spain and overthere tips are not common at all, usually people offers coffee (which is my favourite kind of tip!)

2. ​Should I feel bad for accepting it, or is it considered rude to refuse?

​I’d love to read your perspective!",2,1769940771.0,AskGermany,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I made a post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1qi107f/hawas\_ice\_asad\_elixir\_khamrah\_qahwa\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1qi107f/hawas_ice_asad_elixir_khamrah_qahwa_more/)

I would like to thank u/traditional_fly_7701, they were decluttering their perfumes and I got these at good prices. Got the designers and some decants from him.

Also thanks to the guys at WhiffCulture for the decants and their recommendations.

And the guys at Eynara Perfumes as well.

At this point, I have tried every one of them and these are my opinions:

Asad Elixir, Prada Black, Qahwa, YSL Libre are my favorite. These might not be daily drivers but these are perfect if going to a small gathering or date nights.

Valentino Born in Roma and Bvlgari Man in Black are in similar vein, though they feel more business casual or semi-formal.

As for Eynara, the decant called ""Surprise"" is theirs (besides the ones with their branding) and it was the best among the 3 that I got. I won't go into too much detail regarding them because they are still working on their formula but I enjoyed Surprise (which is supposed to be inspired by Jean Paul Gaultier Scandal Pour Homme / similar honey-amber vibe to Lattafa Najdia Tribute) and Obsidian Elixir (inspired by YSL Black Opium / similar coffee-vanilla depth to Lattafa Qimmah).

I am not sure about freshies at this point (don't even know what particularly makes a perfume a freshie) but among the ones I have, I like Ajmal Shiro the best. Hawas Ice is good but it's not something I would want to wear daily.

Same goes for Mancera Cedrat Boise Intense - this might sound stupid but when I put it on, it smelled like one of the old deos my dad used to wear. I don't know which one exactly but between Brut, Fogg and Old Spice.

I won't comment on the clones I have gotten because I haven't smelled the originals, BUT if were to assume these are ROUGH inspirations, the order of me liking them would be:

Killian Angels Share (clone) > Paco Rabanne (clone) > Aventus Green Tweed (clone) > Dior Savage (clone)

Lastly, I am looking for recommendations on the following:

1. A good daily driver that doesn't break the bank.
2. A good summer frag for special occasions.
3. Good freshies (one budget, one mid, one high end - will get decants of them)

And hey if any of you guys have low partials for a perfume you are willing to let go of, I would be happy to try it on.",1,1769940562.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

Basically, I’m looking for recommendations for a “girlie Bangkok”, focused on:

	•	Beauty & self-care treatments

	•	Shopping

	•	Food & coffee spots

Thank you so much.

1qsujyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Front_Flight_5864/comments/1qsujyd/spy_nanny/,Spy Nanny,"“OmniHome — you live, we provide.” The company’s slogan is the first thing city dwellers see and hear. It’s everywhere: TV, radio, podcasts. OmniHome has quickly become an inseparable part of human life.

Emily was happy to trade her apartment in an old historic building for an OmniHome unit. A smart home system built into the very foundation — a convenient, high-tech solution that lets you stop worrying about daily chores. Just enter your preferred groceries once, and the home orders them itself. The robot vacuum, coffee maker, kettle, and washing machine all run on a schedule. Even the curtains open at the right time.

For Emily, this was a lifesaver. She and her daughter, Diana, moved into a two-story building with eight apartments. Emily got lucky — her place is on the first floor. No struggling with a stroller.

\*\*\*

Six months have passed. Emily has befriended all the neighbors, especially the Traverses, an elderly couple who became surrogate grandparents for Diana.

The evening is winding down. Diana is fed, bathed, and tucked in. A favorite fairy tale, a gentle hug, and the nightlight turns on schedule — a starry sky projected across the ceiling. Emily quietly closes the door.

Soft jazz flows from the speakers; a glass of wine sits on the table. The electric fireplace dims. Emily stretches out on the sofa. A quick glance at the baby monitor: Diana is asleep, hugging her favorite teddy bear.

The wine is almost gone. Emily looks at the monitor screen and freezes. The angle is different. The camera has moved. She shudders as the lens pans further. A notification flashes: **“Movement detected: Nursery.”**

Emily rushes into the room. The bright light hits her eyes. Diana is fast asleep. The room is empty. Windows are locked.

“Probably a glitch or a mosquito,” Emily tells herself, finishing her wine.

Before bed, she checks the monitor again. The angle changes. She immediately sends a request to OmniHome tech support and spends the night on the floor in the nursery. She hears nothing but Diana’s steady breathing.

The technician arrives the next day. “Everything is fine, ma’am,” he reports. “Likely a draft or a software glitch. There was a system update last night.”

Evening returns. The sound of a forest and waterfall drifts from the neighbor's wall. Emily puts Diana to bed and lies down herself.

In the middle of the night, a beep wakes her. **“Movement detected: Nursery.”** Emily grips the tablet, recording the feed.

The camera zooms in on the toy corner. A plush bunny that was sitting on a bench is now lying on the floor. Emily’s heart races. Why wouldn't the bunny stay put?

She puts the tablet aside and pulls up the blanket. Amidst the rustle of the fabric, she doesn't hear the next beep. And she doesn't see another toy fall to the floor — the teddy bear that Diana always hugs in her sleep.",1,1769940097.0,u_Front_Flight_5864,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

So it’s been around 6–7 years of not really being on the market. I took this time for myself and for my future relationship.

Now that I’m back on the grid, I’m finding it really difficult to date, or even understand the whole concept of dating these days. I find it hard to break the ice with girls sometimes. I wonder if it’s just me, or if I’ve been out of the game for so long that I can’t flirt anymore or come up with cheesy lines. I genuinely don’t know what women like these days or what they’re looking for.

Dating apps are the worst. Everyone seems weird, fake, or wannabe, mostly just looking for hookups with unrealistic expectations. It honestly felt easier a few years back. You liked someone, sent a DM, talked for months, and then started dating. Or you just asked them out for coffee. Simple.

I personally feel that people nowadays have too many options and are exposed to constant overstimulation through Instagram, social media, and dating apps. Slowly, it feels like we're becoming numb, losing empathy towards others, and preferring distance over real connection

25M btw. Guys and girls, feel free to share what works for you and what doesn’t. I’m respectfully looking for someone decent, and it’s been tough.",2,1769939965.0,ahmedabad,4,1.0,False

Захиа очих өдрийн мээнд, Өнөөдөр цайгаараа паркад алхангаа “Кино цаашаа” подкастыг анх удаа сонслоо. Хоёр хөтлөгч маань сонсогчдынхоо түүхийг алагчлахгүй тал талаас нь хамжаад сэтгэгдлээ их хөөрхөн хуваалцах юм. Тийм болохоор нь түүхээ хуваалцмаар санагдлаа. Бас л эмч, эмчлүүлэгч хоёрын харилцааны тухай л даа. Гэхдээ өөр. Шал өөр. Товчхондоо эмчдээ дурласан түүх. Саяхан нэг мэс засалд орсон юм. Хүнд биш ч хөнгөн биш ажилбар. Мэс заслын эмчтэйгээ анх танилцахад л амь насаа даатгаж болохуйц хүн байна гэсэн итгэл үнэмшил шууд төрсөн. Нэгхэн удаа уулзсан хэрнээ ой санаанд тод үлдчихдэг хүмүүс байдаг даа? Тийм хүн. Дээрээс нь, эмнэлэгийн биш хүнд ч эзэмшсэн мэргэжилдээ гаргууд сайн гэдэг нь мэдрэгдмээр. Миний кэйс болохоор мэс засалд орвол тодорхой хэмжээний эрсдэлтэй, орохгүй бол түүнээс ч илүү эрсдэл бий болох магадлалтай байсан юм. Тиймээс эмч маань тэр бүхнийг тайлбарлаж намайг сайн бодож байгаад ир гээд явуулсан юм. Тэр үед эмчийгээ романтик нүдээр харж эхлээгүй байлаа. 7,8 сарын дараа би хагалгаанд орохоор эрс шийдсэн байв. Хоёрдох удаагаа эмчтэйгээ уулзахдаа бүгдийг судлаад, нөхцөл байдлыг тооцчихсон, өөрийн кэйсийг бүрэн дүүрэн ойлгосон, мэтгэлцэхэд бэлэн. Тэгэхэд л анх намайг анзаарч харав уу гэлтэй төвлөрч сонсох шиг санагдсан. Харц нь хамгийн түрүүнд нүдэнд туссан. Маш соргог, эмпати сайтай гэмээр хүнлэг харц. Яав ч муу хүн биш кк. Эрэгтэй хүний харцанд дасаагүй би гэнэт ярьж байснаа ичингүйрэнгээ аядав. Өөрөө ч муугүй залуу. Өндөөр, туранхай, өвөрмөцдүү төрхтэй, царайлаг тал даа. Эмнэлэгт хэвтэхийн өмнөх өдөр нь өөр нэг эрүүл мэндийн шалтгаанаар бие гэнэт муудав. Уг нь мэс заслын өмнө тэгж өвдөж болохгүй байсан юм л даа. Арай чүү эмнэлэгийн хаалга татаж эмчдээ учирлаж эм тариа хийлгэж дээрдлээ. Тэр өдөр эмч маань намайг хоёр ч удаа эргэж тойрсон юм. Орны толгойн дэргэд ирж суугаад л дотнорхож ярина. Бас бус миний эргэн тойрон, авчирсан ном сэлтийг маань анзаараад байх шиг санагдсан. Миний хувьд олон ч тохиолдолд хүмүүстэй ярилцахаар долгион таардаггүй тал бий. Буруу зөрүүгээр ойлголцоод явчих тохиолдол нэлээн гардаг л даа. Харин эмчтэйгээ төвөггүйхэн ойлголцоод байсан. Мэс заслын өглөө. 7 өнгөрч байхад сувилагч ирж томдсон халат өмсүүлэв. Тун удалгүй эмч маань маркер барьсаар орж ирэн хүзүүн дээр минь хэд хэдэн тэмдэглэгээ хийлээ. Яг надруу харчихаад юм зураад байсанд жаахан ичингүйрч толгойгоо маажсанд шоолонгуй инээмсэглэв. Мэс заслын өрөө. Ногоон плита, өндөр тааз, нарийхаан өндөр ор. Хэдэн сувилагч эгч нар баахан зохицуулалт хийж харагдана. Мэдээгүйжүүлэх тариа хийхээс өмнө, эмч маань анх удаа намайг богино нэрээр минь дуудаж “Д… , хөгжим сонсдог уу? Ямар дуун дээр унтмаар байна? Ямар ч дуу байж болно” гэж асуув. Тулгамдаад би дуугаа захиалж чадсангүй. Гэтэл мөд удалгүй нэг их танил хэрнээ ховор дуу явсан юм. David Bowie ч юм уу, Billy Idol, эсвэл Lou Reed. Ямар дуу байсныг нь асууя гэж бодоод чадаагүй. 100 хүртэл тоолоорой гэлээ. Шууд ховсдуулсан аятай тоолж эхлэв. 1,2,3,4,5........ 28. Унтуулганаас сэрэхдээ би ойрын хэдэн жил амраагүйгээрээ амарсан сэрсэн юм. Мэс засал байж болох хамгийн сайнаараа болжээ. Ямар дуу байсныг нь олох гэж би сүүлийн нэг сар гарам дандаа 80-д оны дуу хөгжим сонсож байна кк. Одоо хүртэл олоогүй л байна. Хамгийн ойртох нь Billy Idol-н Eyes without a face юм уудаа. Мэс заслын дараахан тасагтаа байхад эмч маань эргэж тойрлоо. Бага зэрэг ядруу харагдаж билээ. Хамаг хүч энерги, ур чадвараа гаргадаг байх л даа. Баасан гарагт хагалгаанд орсон учраас амралтын өдрүүдээр эмчийгээ намайг эргэж тойрно гэж санасангүй. Хагассайны өглөө ирлээ. Шархаа харчихаад үр дүнд нь их л сэтгэл хангалуун байгаа болтой буцаад явсан. Тэрүүхэн хоорондоо бас хөөрхөн хошигноод амжсан. Эмчийн хувцастай харсаар байгаад энгийн хувцастай харсан бүр догь шүү. Энгийн хувцастай явж байхыг бодвол амарч л байсан байх. Амралтын өдрөөрөө эмчлүүлэгчээ зориод ирсэн байгаа юм. Бүтэнсайны өглөө бас намайг эргэв. Удалгүй эмнэлэгээс гарлаа. Эмнэлэгт хэвтсэн өдрүүд үнэхээр сюрреал байсаан. Надад бас энэ үгийг ашиглах өдөр ирдэг л юм байна. СЮРРЕАЛ. Долоо хоногийн дараа “уулзахаар” болов. Уулзалтаа тэсэн ядан хүлээж долоо хоног нь боллоо. Хүзүүндээ томоос том сорвитой хэрнээ дажгүй харагдахыг хичээж очлоо. Эмч маань бараг л намайг таньсангүй кк. Эмнэлэгт хэвтэх хугацаандаа өнгө зүс муутай байсан биз ээ, би. Хэсэг ажлаа хийхийг нь анзааран суулаа. Настайвтар сувилагч эгч эмчид маань бүлээн ус дөхүүлж өгөв. Хөөрхий ядардаг байх даа гэсэн шүү юм бодсон шиг ээ гарыг нь ажиглан суув. Тэр л гар нь намайг унтах зуур биеэнд минь хүрч мэс хүргэсэн гэж бодохоор. Гэнэт намайг өөрийг нь ажиглаад байгааг анзаарах шиг би харцаа буруулав. “Д, ажлынхаа дундуур гараад ирсэн үү? Яарч байна уу?” “Би гайгүй ээ, лаптопоо аваад гараад ирсэн. Эмчтэйгээ “уулзана” гээд хэлчихсэн” гэсэнд царайнд нь мишээл тодров. ""Та харин ажил ихтэй байна уу? Би гараад хүлээж байх уу?"" “Зүгээр одоохон дууслаа” Оёогоо авахуулах гэж байна. “Эмч ээ өвдөх үү?” “Эмчийгээ найрвал өвдөхгүй” гэж хошигнов. Оёогоо авахуулчихаад цүнхэндээ байгаа юмаа өгөх гэж учраа олохгүй л байлаа. Жигнэмэг хийсэн юм л даа. Бүйлстэй, ногоон цайтай печень. Дайзогоос Merry Christmas гэсэн бичигтэй хайрцаг аваад тэрэндээ хичээгүйлэн ногоон, шараар нь өрөөд гэрээсээ гарч ирсэн юм. “Эмч ээ та харшилтай юу?” “Айн?” “Аан, би харин нэг печень хийсэн юм аа. Самартай шүү. Май, баярлалаа” гээд нүүр өөд нь харалгүй өглөө. “Өөрөө хийсэн юм уу?” “Тэгсэн” гээд толгой дохив. Нүүр аль хэдийн улайгаад гарахын түүс. Хэсэг байж байснаа нэг бичиг бөглүүлэхээ мартсанаа санаж буцаад орохоос өөр аргагүйд хүрэв. Сувилагчид нь өгөөд бөглүүлчихье гэсэн эмч дуудаж “ороод ирээ” гэлээ. “Печень нь янзын болсон байнашдээ” гэсэнд “Тийм байна уу?” гээд дорхноо сэргэлээ би. Бараг намайг печенийхээ талаар коммент сонсох гэж буцаж орж ирсэн байх гэж бодсон байх. Эмнэлэгээс харих замдаа хөл хөөрцөг болсон хүн л явлаа. Эмчийгээ гүүгэлдсэнд мэргэжлийн тал дээр овоо хэдэн мэдээлэл гарч ирж байдаг шүү. Лав хоёр подкастад оржээ. Эмчийнхээ л дуу хоолойг сонсох гэж тэр хоёр подкастыг нь ээлж дарааллан сонслоо. 20,30 удаа сонссон байх. Сүүлдээ бүр нарийн мэс заслын тухай ойлгох шигээ боллоо. Зарим нэг үгийг дуудаж байгаа нь, өөрийгөө хэл яриагаар тэгэж сайн илэрхийлж байгаа нь үнэхээр гайхмаар. Улам бүр дурлана. Гэхдээ тэгэж донтож сонсох жаахан “эрүүл бус” санагдаад сүүлийн үед сонсохгүйг хичээж байна. Сэтгэлээ илчлэхээр шийдэв. Эхлээд уртавтар юм бичиж байснаа сүүлдээ бүр богиносгоод хоёр өгүүлбэр л болгов. 30 удаа бичсэн байх. Өгөх үү, яах уу гэж шийдэж ядсаар л байна. Нэг найзын маань хэлснээр “харамсах зүйлгүй амьдрах хэрэгтэй, чамд алдах юм байхгүй”, (алдах юм байна, нэр хүнд, дараа нь таарвал яах юм болж байна кк) нөгөө найзын маань хэлснээр “бараг л гэр бүлтэй болов уу, энэ мэдрэмжээ уран бүтээл л болго доо”.

1qsuenu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Immediate-Debt7253/comments/1qsuenu/aio_being_uncomfortable_with_my_boyfriends_best/,AIO? Being uncomfortable with my boyfriends best friend girlfriend,"I already wrote a post regarding this topic. Quick recap: My boyfriend has a best friend and we went on a double date with his girlfriend during summer. It was fine, but nothing that made me feel connected to her.

During summer, I got into cycling and made quick progress. My boyfriend was proud and mentioned it to people, including this couple. I went with her on a ride together once, and she seemed intimidated by cycling, so I tried to be supportive, overall it was a good experience.

Later she bought an indoor trainer like we did. She started training and doing intervals like me. After that, she suddenly started sending my boyfriend her indoor training screenshots from Strava. He found it weird too. Nothing romantic, it just felt like she was trying to get validation or compete, which made us both uncomfortable. Apparently, she also saw my boyfriend commenting on my Strava posts and asked her boyfriend why is he not commenting hers.

Eventually she also got into swimming (which is my original sport) and asked my boyfriend—not me—for advice. He redirected her to me, and I gave her recommendations when she finally reached out. But she took two weeks to reply and didn’t acknowledge the delay. Her communication just feels off and one-sided.

Overall, I don’t really want to build a friendship with her. I find the dynamic uncomfortable and weirdly competitive.

Recently, my boyfriend said he wants all four of us to have a Christmas dinner together. The friend kept delaying giving a date, then they switched plans to a cooking night at hers place. She was acting a bit weird there and unfriendly. I felt like a 4 wheel there. She was constantly referring only to my boyfriend, like “can you please lift this chair”, “or look what I bought”, “or come for Pilates class again”, “look at the stone I got for my interior”, we both felt a bit weird, and she was rarely referring to me. 

So I had weird vibes during dinner. And then during Christmas we got sick with my boyfriend very bad, were in bed for 2 weeks. And apparently his best friend wrote that his girlfriend also got sick, and he is not in town. And my boyfriend started asking her extensively if she is alright, if she can do groceries, if she has thermometer to measure her temperature, and that she must feel bad as she also on period like me (that’s he just said to me, as his friend mentioned it once and we know that we are synched). I felt really bad, I don’t see anything wrong in asking or simply wishing a person to get better soon, but this felt like over caring for other woman, and I felt deprioritised. 

I explained to him that she disrespected me before and my boyfriend didn’t take it into account. I said I don’t want to have anything in common with this person and he decided he talks to his bf about it. He did and now the girlfriend suggested for us 3 to meet for coffee, I don’t know what to do. 

My boyfriend also said her insecurity might also come from the fact that we once went on a group cycling ride, and we split there in two groups and we both were in different ones. And she could not finish that ride that’s why she felt inferior maybe. But she was not even my friend there to babysit her, I had many other friends there and we didn’t agree on anything with her. 

From my point in understand he wanted to raise this issue to his bf but I don’t need repair or reconnection or even apology from her, I don’t want to have this person in my life. ",1,1769939610.0,u_Immediate-Debt7253,0,1.0,False

I’m really hoping to meet someone I can properly get to know — someone I click with enough that it could grow into a long-distance thing or eventually a real relationship. Location isn’t a barrier; I’m open to chatting with women anywhere.

I’m into sports (football/soccer is my main one, but I’ve become a legit baseball fan from US trips), coffee, movies, and aviation (which probably explains why I love traveling so much). I was in LA, Vegas, and NYC in 2024, went back to New York last year, and Boston + Miami are up next this summer. Long-term I’d like to move to the States, but right now I’m just looking for a cool, interesting person to talk to regularly.

Music taste = basically anything that slaps.

Personality-wise I’m pretty laid-back, a bit sarcastic, and I get genuinely excited hearing other people’s stories.

If that sounds like a vibe you’re into, message me! Tell me your favorite movie (or the one you can watch over and over), the best place you’ve ever traveled, or literally whatever’s on your mind. Happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.

Looking forward to hearing from you :)",1,1769939552.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1qsudm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MissIrishLass/comments/1qsudm6/i_used_to_be_a_avid_outdoorsman_but_now_im/,"I used to be a avid outdoorsman, but now I'm terrified of being in any wooded areas.","The Journey-

I don't care if a campground seems like it has enough people or not;  My hands are still shaking while I write this, even after a year, and I doubt I'll ever feel safe enough to go camping ever again. 

Autumn in the upper Midwest is when the leaves turn into various hues of red and yellow-copper. The days grow colder and the sun sets earlier, while rising slower, leading to longer nights. It can be miserable and soul-dragging once winter hits, so most folks up here try to get as much time outside as possible before the first freeze. That is what my spouse, Blainey and I decided to do this past fall.

We made the long five-hour trek, driving to a densely wooded area: the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The drive went well; we stopped a few times due to our small bladders and excited coffee habits, but overall, the drive felt short. We both felt ourselves unwind from the overflow of long work weeks. We truly needed a break. The daily stress of our responsibilities started to melt off our shoulders with every passing hour and every badly sung 80s rock song that came across the radio. When we finally reached the town where our prepaid campsite was located, we were glowing and ready for adventure.

We don't use campers or fancy equipment. We use tents, sleep on the ground, and hope that a random pinecone or pebble won't get too frisky while we’re in our sleeping bags, causing holes where moisture might seep in if it drizzles. We also tend not to bring food because there's a store we like to visit that has an in-store meat market with the freshest steaks, sausages, and all-beef hot dogs from local farms. It’s convenient, the prices are doable, and it beats carrying in a large cooler, allowing us to pack more organized and stay comfortable.

The Setting-

The town our campsite was in has a population of maybe four thousand people. It isn't very large, but the area is well known for fishing, which brings in tourists from all over the country throughout all seasons. All in all, it’s buzzing with families and vacationers.

We didn't even have to think about bad things happening before this experience. But now? It makes me queasy to think of those families with small children, unaware of the danger they are actually in once they set up camp, go hiking, or simply exit their vehicles at the wrong time. I'm ashamed to say the local departments, unbeknownst to me prior to this incident, likely cover things up in their reporting. They use words like ""unknown animal attacks,"" or convince the public that the people who go missing yearly were just lost off the trails, or somehow disappeared in the water without a trace. Their belongings are often found in spaces previously searched by Search and Rescue (SAR) teams with dogs. While it is plausible to go missing in the forest, it isn't likely to happen as often as they suggest.

Most trails here have very noticeable signage—about one sign every fifteen feet. The trails are well-kept, making the footpaths easily distinguishable; the moment you step off the trail, you're immediately surrounded by thick, wild brush. As for the fishermen, the lake is small enough that you can distinguish faces from shoreline to shoreline. Voices echo off the water in all directions. Now that I think about it, it would be difficult for someone not to see or hear something happen.

It isn't rare for people to go missing. At least once a month, a news story will break about ""missing persons from out of state,"" a ""well-known resident who never came back from a fishing day,"" or an ""avid outdoorsman missing."" Most of the time, people believe those explanations. I did. Everyone does, if you aren't a full-time resident. The waters and forests, while beautiful, are deadly if not respected. You tell yourself that if you don't watch your step, things can go bad. Right? That's what we always told ourselves, too.

Arrival-

We made our way onto the highway; mostly it’s just a two-lane road with a speed limit higher than it should be and many potholes. They don't keep up with road repairs very well. It was the only road leading to our destination, so we ignored the issue until we finally saw the turn for the campground.

The driveway is so hidden and overgrown with tall grass and that if you haven't been there before, you could easily miss it if you blink. Our tires made a crunchy sound on the mixture of dirt and rock as we passed the ""5 mph"" speed limit sign. Everything was the same as our last visit, aside from some new playground equipment and camper rentals.

When we arrived at the main building, the kind woman who worked there—I’ll call her ""Sharon""—smiled in greeting. She was already outside with a plastic bucket for us to collect wood. She had seen us at least once a year for the past decade, so recognition hit her eyes. We sat around catching up while filling out the entrance paperwork. She gave us a map, our campsite location, and enough wood for the weekend. We had a daunting time finding a place for the wood container amongst our gear, so I eventually just squeezed the passenger seat back and put it on my lap.

The site was nice and secluded, just as Sharon had promised due to us being loyal visitors, she gave us the ""prime"" spot: away from most people, but closest to the kayak rentals.

The area had the right mix of pine needles on flat, soft dirt. The shoreline was only thirty feet away, and on the other side, dense forestry stretched for miles. This forest isn't like most. It has low hills and mounds that cast strange shadows, and the underbrush is more like clover and tall sawgrass. There are an abundance of evergreens and birch trees, but very few maple or oak due to the extreme climate; reaching anywhere from 90°F summers to winters well below zero.

We also have a variety of woodland creatures: white-tailed deer, black and brown bears, squirrel, and a plethora of rabbits and chipmunks. Nighttime is usually active. You hear the wind bustling through the trees like the waves of an ocean. The noises simply don't stop. It’s comforting when they don’t stop. The noises stopping... well, that's the first hint that something is wrong. It’s when you instinctively become aware of your surroundings, almost like your hair picks something up before your mind does. Primal.

The First Night-

After our tent was set up and the fire was going, we sat in our lawn chairs. Our seasoned steaks were marinating as we waited for the coals to get hot enough for the hanging grill. There were about two hours left before nightfall, rendering all vision useless without a flashlight. Even though it wasn't dark-dark yet, the forest was becoming lively, with owls hooting in the distance and squirrels chattering.

We were hungry. Neither of us had wanted to eat on the drive up; we just wanted to get there before sunset. The smell of the food made our bellies rumble, and once the steaks were medium-rare and the veggies were boiled al dente, we both dug in with satisfied smiles.

Afterward, we cleaned our plates at the built-in faucet—a new improvement I hadn't noticed before—and sat back down to roast marshmallows for s'mores. The day had gone quickly. We were both yawning within an hour of sundown and decided to get into our pajamas and climb into our sleeping bags. We had a full day of fishing and hiking planned for tomorrow.

I got into the tent first, and Blainey followed suit, making sure to keep our dirty shoes by the door so we didn't get sand in our sleeping bags. Our clothes sat in the far corner, and a lamp swayed gently from the tent ceiling. The night wasn't too cold, and there was no rain expected, so we kept the top vent open to see the stars. Our tent was about six feet tall and could easily fit five people—shaped like an elongated igloo with two tunnel entrances. Both tunnels had zippered doors, which we locked.

It wasn't until Blainey started to snore lightly that I realized my eyes were still open. I moved my wrist, and my watch glowed: 1:48 AM. I wondered why I was awake, or if I’d even fallen asleep at all.

As I was coming to, trying to make sense of the moment, I heard it. The nothingness. No noise. The usual night critters weren't chirping. There was no scuttling of a rabbit, no crickets. Deathly silent. It was genuinely off-putting.

Then I felt it. The hair on my arms and the back of my neck stood on end. My heart started beating so hard I could hear it in my ears. In that silence, it felt like whatever was out there could hear my heart, too—and that it was enjoying my fear. There was no wind. No noise whatsoever. This felt like a predator intelligently waiting for a moment.

Bears don't stalk like that; they grunt, sniff, and circle. This felt different.

I didn't know what to do, so I lie as still as possible. I pulled the sleeping bag up just under my eyes and looked toward Blainey for comfort. I felt like something was aware of me, watching from outside the tent, looking through the fabric. I felt that if I moved too suddenly, or if Blainey did, that something would be ""set off."" I tried to convince myself I was being irrational—just a city kid freaking out in the dark.

I stayed still for two hours. When the normal woodland sounds finally returned, a wave of relief washed over me. I sat straight up, accidentally waking Blainey.

""Are you okay? What's wrong?"" she asked in a sleepy, scratchy voice.

""Nothing,"" I said. ""I just needed a drink of water.""

I picked up my Hydro Flask. I didn't tell her the truth. I didn't want to ruin the vacation. That was a mistake—a moment that would eventually fester into a wound neither of us could have expected.


The Shop and the Legend-

I fell asleep just as the sun started to peak. I woke to the smell of coffee.

""Babe... wake up,"" Blainey whispered. ""It's time to get our fishing gear set up.""

I put my sunglasses on immediately to shield my stinging eyes and sat up. Blainey handed me a plastic mug of perfectly fire roasted coffee.

""Thank you,"" I said.

She helped me stand, and my joints popped loudly. At thirty-one, your joints start to remind you that time waits for no one.

""How'd you sleep?"" I asked.

""Great! I stayed asleep the entire night. I was so comfortable,"" Blainey said with a fresh smile.

Outside, the site looked undisturbed. No animal tracks. Blainey had already started the fire for bacon, eggs, and toast, and coffee… of course.

""How'd you sleep?"" she asked again.

""Good,"" I lied. ""Just a bit drowsy still.""

The morning went well. We rented kayaks, caught a few bass, and filleted them for lunch. Afterward, we hiked a short trail, taking pictures of mushrooms and historical plaques about indigenous tribes. By 2:00 PM, we decided to check out the shops in town.

After getting ice cream, a small store caught my eye: an indigenous spiritual shop. Inside, the log cabin interior was filled with handmade products—wool sweaters, blankets, and trinkets. Two women were working near the incense area.

""What's that scent?"" I asked.

The older woman, sitting on a barstool, replied, ""It's Juniper and corn pollen—hand-picked by our cousins on the reservation."" Her accent was thick, drawing out certain syllables. ""It is for blessing, protection, and praying around your space.""

""How much?"" I asked.

The younger woman stepped forward. ""Prices are on the bottom. Here.""

""Does it protect you from... bears?"" I asked.

The older woman cut in. ""Something like that. And evil spirits.""

""Bad spirits, huh?"" I muttered.

The woman behind the counter nodded. ""Yes, evil spirits. Our ancestors walked these lands for many years before colonization. They knew what was here. We have legends of those experiences.""

Before I could ask more, Blainey called me over to look at a hand-woven blanket. We ended up buying the juniper and corn pollen sticks, some sage, and a pair of opal shell earrings. We headed back to camp around 5:00 PM. I was quiet the whole way back, thinking about the woman’s words.


Encounter-

Back at camp, I started the fire. We roasted hot dogs and talked while time past, not noticing how dark it had become until the stars were out in full force. The Milky Way was visible, and a bright, full moon highlighted the treetops. While the fire casted an deep orange glow along the lower trunks.

It was 11:30 PM when the wind suddenly died down. Blainey looked around, concerned.

""It's very quiet out here..."" she said.

My skin crawled as I remembered the night before. I could see the goosebumps on her arms. I scooted my chair closer to hers.

""Are you okay?""

""Yeah,"" she whispered. ""I just feel a little creeped out. The shadows aren't helping.""

No sooner had she said that than we saw them.

Eyes.

They were on the far side of the fire, just beyond the reach of the light. Orange-yellow eyes, slightly glowing, with no pupils. They were vertical, as if whatever they belonged to was peeking around a tree at an impossible angle. They were much higher up than any man, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw a silhouette: a neck and shoulders that were wider than mine, yet strangely frail.

We both stood up, clutching each other's elbows. The darkness seemed to be ""eating"" the light of the fire. One of us let out a piercing scream, and we bolted for the car.

Once inside, Blainey started and turned on the high beams. There was an owl sitting there. Its head swiveled to look at us. We both let out a sigh of relief and started laughing nervously.

""Damn, it's just an owl,"" Blainey said, rolling her eyes.

""Yeah,"" I replied, but I wasn't convinced. I’ve seen owls, but I’ve never seen one with shoulders that wide or human-like.

We sat in the car for forty-five minutes with the lights on. Eventually, the owl took flight and disappeared. The normal forest sounds returned, and I felt okay enough to step back out. We decided to head to bed. We left the fire as embers, we didn't want to be in total darkness.


Attack-

I fell asleep first, but a short time later, a heavy elbow hit my ribs. I bolted awake. Blainey’s eyes were wide, and she was breathing heavily. I followed her gaze.

I regret that I did.

Those eyes were back, staring directly into the mesh window at the top of our tent. We had left the window with the mesh screen open the previous night, to fall asleep to the stars- but never closed it.  The eyes, like before,  were connected to a human-like neck and those same broad, frail shoulders. I quickly noted how sickly thin and boney the collar bone area was- how the skin of this thing seemed impossibly thin, and loose fitting. I took note of the color, even in the shadowing of the night, it was grotesquely pale.  They watched us with an ancient, intelligent intensity.

Then came the sound: a light scrape-tap. A hand with impossibly long, sharp fingers were slowly scratching the fabric of the tent. It's knuckles had too many joints,  large and boney- and the skin of the hand loosely fit,  just as the shoulders did. I realized then how thin those tent walls were. We both shrank down into our sleeping bags, trying to disappear into the dirt.

Blainey let out a soft, stifled whimper, followed by the loudest screech I’ve ever heard. I felt my back being scraped—like a massive rug burn—and heard the tent fabric tear. I felt my lower half jerk upward toward the treetops, and hands grabbed me from below.

The darkness of the night overcame my vision. I fainted.



The Ranger-

I woke up to a park ranger hovering over me. He was in his fifties, with deep wrinkles and long black hair in a braid.

""You okay, ma'am? I'm with the Park Ranger services. My name is Darrel Lakota.""

I looked around. The tent was nowhere near me-  or rather, I was nowhere near it. Pain shot through my ankles.

""Hold on there,"" Darrel said, pushing my shoulder down gently. ""It's best to wait for medical services.""

""Where's Blainey?"" I panicked.

""She's over there. She's fine. Unlike you, she isn't injured at all."" He looked at me gravely. ""You're lucky, you know that?""

""What happened?"" I asked.

The ranger weighed his words carefully. ""Well, ma'am... you were attacked in your sleep by an unknown wild animal. It dragged you out of your tent before Mrs. Blainey started screaming. The neighboring residents, my family from the reservation across the lake, heard you. You met them earlier today at the shop.""

He continued, ""My sister and her son came quickly by canoe and helped ward it away.""

""Ward..."" He used the word ward, not ""fight"" like you would fight a bear. It was spiritual.

I looked at the trees around me and took note of the claw marks. There were five gouges: deep cuts as if from a heavy blade. They looked like the marks a human hand would make, except the scratches were from impossibly large fingers.

A familiar scent drifted off the man and from the fire behind me: Juniper and corn pollen. An incense stick was already lit, and the older woman from the shop in town started another, praying and concentrating as she watched the smoke. Behind her was the young man—her son—doing the same, though he held a feather and something burning in a conch shell. Then I saw the younger woman from the shop; she held a pouch of dust, throwing it and praying alongside them.

Blainey was behind them by the car, speaking with medical staff and another ranger. She was answering questions while the ranger hastily jotted down notes, nodding his head. The medical staff made eye contact with me and immediately pushed past the others, reaching my side in a few urgent strides.

I hadn’t looked at my feet yet. They felt... weird. There was a squishy, oddly sticky sensation, and then the pain hit. I lifted my head to look down. Deep, maroon gashes covered my shins, leading all the way down to my ankles, the same pattern as the scratches on the tree.

The paramedic didn’t say much. He went right to work, telling me to hang on and that he was there to help. I felt the prick of a needle, followed by immediate relief.

""You’re going to feel really drowsy. It’s okay to fall asleep,"" he said. My eyes started to flutter. I couldn't fight it; it felt too good to finally close them.

The Aftermath-

Twenty-four hours later, I woke up in a hospital bed. The steady beep of the monitor kept time with my heart. Blainey was right by my side, her head resting on the mattress while she held my hand.

""Hey,"" I whispered.

She jolted awake, smiling as she sat up. ""How are you feeling?""

""I’m okay. I don't feel anything right now."" I suppose they had me on some heavy painkillers. She nodded in understanding.

I was released from the hospital the next day. Once we were home, I asked her exactly what had happened. She told me that after I passed out, my head had fallen back too fast. The thing outside the tent must have reacted the way a predator does to sudden movement. It ripped through the tent door, grabbed me by my shins, and dragged me twenty feet into the edge of the forest as if I weighed nothing.

She had screamed and managed to grab my hands, engaged in a terrifying tug-of-war that caused just enough of a delay for the mother and son across the lake to hear her. They had been fishing on their shore and paddled over in a rush. They saw the creature and started chanting a prayer in their native tongue, flooding the area with high-powered flashlights and the smoke of juniper and corn pollen.

The creature had screeched and hissed as if the words, the smoke, and the light physically burned it. Then, it was gone.

A Different Life-

The Lakota family saved my life. Blainey saved me by distracting it. We are all lucky to be alive.

We haven't been camping since. I reach out to the family occasionally, and they sometimes invite us to sweat lodges for prayers and songs. This is an honor they don't often extend to outsiders. They respect us, and we respect them. They saved me, and I thank them every day.

One positive thing to come of this is the lifelong friendship we've formed. They still send juniper and corn pollen through the mail, which I burn in every corner of my home and land. We’ve adopted many of their spiritual ways.

As for my leg? Each deep gouge required over 112 stitches. The local law enforcement departments wanted my report so they could ""find the animal,"" but every time I would tell them the truth, they shut me down. They claim they can’t publish my account because it would hurt tourism. They told me my experience wasn't ""of a sound or logical mind"" and chalked it up to the blood loss I experienced, which, to them, caused me to have delirious hallucinations.

But from the way they said it, I knew. They are hiding the truth for the sake of the town's economy. Since the incident, I’ve gone searching for other unofficial reports. I’ve found at least a hundred, spread variously across the continental U.S. in other Natural Forests. 

There are even old reports of SAR teams looking for missing people with trained dogs, only to find the bodies mangled and oddly impaled on the tops of broken trees. It’s as if those people fell out of the sky and landed on the branches, sixty feet up.

My fiancé was diagnosed with stomach cancer end of May 2025 and while things went really well for the past 7 months the last 2 weeks all hell has broken loose and could use some stories that could possibly give us some positive feelings.

We are located in Greece so please pardon my english language mistakes. He had just turned 40 ( and me 30) when we found about it through a gastroscopy after some 24-hour stomache. Doctors moved so fast (due to the young of his age they said). Within a week we had frozen sperm, done PET scans, got results of a Molecular Diagmostic test and started his first chemo. First 4 sessions went well. Tumour in the stomach had shrank by half and there was reduction in size on the glands/lymph nodes. Oncologist called his whole team of doctors to his office to give congratulations for this success with my partner present.

Funny thing is with all those scans we found he was born with an anomally and his main artery giving blood to all his organs was on tha opposite side most humans usually have it. So they kept telling us how lucky we were thanks to this anomaly. How early we got it (even though I just found out even from back then it was still stage 4) and how the lymphs were treated as local spread and not metastasis.

Gastroenterologist did another gastroscopy and came out beaming from happiness at how the tumour inside his stomach had reduced. How it used to be so swollen blocking half his stomach and now it was flat on the walls. Oncologist and his team along with the surgeon decided not to proceed with the surgery yet, as they had planned afte the first 4 chemos, and to continue doing therapy. He did 3 more chemos and then took a break for a new PET scan which unfortunately showed there was no more reduction and had remained pretty much stable so they decided to plan for surgery. Unfortunately we were not able to find a date for his surgery in the local hospitals within the time window doctors needed after his last chemo. It was decided to have one last chemo, his 8th, for maintenance mostly and arranged for surgery on January.

He was doing so well. During all his chemotherapies he had so few negative syptoms. No vomiting, no diarrhoea, no fevers. We would sometimes go out for coffee with friends, eat with my family, go on short trips to visit his family or friends and no one could believe he was going through chemo based on past experiences with their fiends and family that had cancer. Doctors kept telling us how strong his body is and that is why they suggested the risky surgery, because they believed he would make it.

Time passed and we are preparing to admit him in hospital. Couple dates before the surgery he started having some back pains. I brought an orthopaedic at home and it seemed to be some sort of cold/nerve crick from a cold draft or something. Pain was coming and going and in different places, not just one. We still admitted him in hospital, all exams there came back clean and the following morning they went to prep him for surgery. While undressing him he grew a fever. Surgery was cancelled, after they made sure it was no covid or flu they sent us home.

Back pain remained and we decided to do an MRI that showed there was a fractured spinal bone. Doctors feared for metastasis and we did a new Pet scan, which showed some really bad things. Multiple metastases on his spine, pelvis and 2 ribs. His stomach tumour and lymphs had remained pretty much the same though.

We are so devastated. All doctors are literally pulling their hair on how it happened so fast, within couple weeks, and without affecting any other organs. They all keep telling me how strong he was both physically and metally. How his soul every time they met him for chemo had such a strong radiating energy that was transferring good vibes to all other patients during his  sessions. How all his other organs, heart, lungs, all were more than healthy. They all were speechless.

We hoped it would be some sort or negative impact from the chemos or an allergic reaction or osteoporosis or inflammation etc. even though they gave us little possibilities. But nope. All tests showed metastases. And it's rare, 1% possibility in our country to happen and there is no cure. Told us to forget surgery, it will never happen. Told us we were lucky he grew feverish and didn't had the surgery because with the new situation he would not have made it. We have a saying in our country, that ""everything happens for a reason"" and doctors and family used that a lot. I hope and pray it's true and it did happen for the reason of finding cure some other way and not for him to die slowly in just a few months!

Doctors are focusing now on reducing his pain and possibly stopping the spread, meaning trying to expand his life. There is a tiny possibility of shrinking the tumour or putting it to sleep but nothing is sure and it would be close to a miracle. The previous chemos he did were the strongest ones to exist, cocktail of 3 different drugs and the 24-hour port pump treatment at home. Now they try other drugs and gave us the 46- hour port pump, plus will start some radiation therapy for the fractured spinal bone from Monday.

My fiancé hadn't realised the severity of the situation, doctors didn't really tell him, only talked about his new treatment. Only after last Friday (2 days ago), when he started a new cycle of chemos and we returned home and had a chat as he could see I was not doing well mentally, he realised how terminal this is and his mental health plummeted. I don't know how to comfort him other than keep telling him we will fight this together and that he is my giant so I don't want him to give up but keep trying. That just like he hmwas in the 1% for this to happen he may be in the 1% percent to beat it.

I have cried so much with aml this, when I am alone or not at home. We were looking at venues and wedding dresses when we found about it in May. It had been 8 months since he started working as a welder with my dad and was so happy to finally have found a job he loved and learned so much. We had moved back home after 6 years in the UK and had finally good jobs and things were going so good for both of us. We were looking for possibly moving to a bigger house and planning about having children. And it's so tragic that 2 years ago he almost lost me from peritonitis only for me to lose him now. What sort of punishment or karma game is this?!

I am praying to God, all the saints, gods of other religions and ancient times, my ancestors, everyone for a miracle. I talked to the doctors and told them to try everything, every trial, every machine, I don't care if he will end up with a disability or in a wheelchair, even in that condition you can still make a family and a good life. I just want more time with him.

We have so many friends that had cancer and made it in the end even though they were given only days or weeks! But their cases were different and immunotherapy worked magically. In our case we may not even be able to get that because of his molecular type...

So yeah, I could really, really use some positive stories, no matter how hard they were to get to the happy end, just to give me a bit of hope and strength please.

1qsubdn,https://i.redd.it/olhjbpf8uugg1.jpeg,מרים המגדלית,"I don't delve much into Biblical Hebrew, but I always wondered the correct meaning of her name. I'm Jewish, but have attended a mass or two here in Ireland, and the priest once said ""Mary of Magdala"" which didn't seem correct to me.

מרים is straightforward enough, but המגדלית:

- ה (the) [prefix]
- מגדל (Migdal, the location by the Sea of Galilee) 
- ית (of/from) [suffix]

Therefore, her full name is ""Mary, the woman from Magdala""? And, מגדלית alone without the ה is ""a woman from Magdala"" as מגדלי would be ""a man from Magdala""?

I know that כוס קפה means ""cup [of] coffee"" where ""of"" is implied, and not written, but as מרים had the suffix ית in המגדלית, ""of"" felt wrong, and redudant.

I was SO unsure here.

That said, you don’t have to be from the same domain — I’m totally open to meeting people from different backgrounds too. Sometimes the best conversations come from unexpected places.

If you’re someone who:
Works in digital marketing / data / tech. Likes meaningful conversations over loud parties. Enjoys coffee walks, casual meetups, or just chilling and talking life.…we’ll probably get along just fine 🙂

“I’ll just check one thing first.”

“I’m not in the right headspace yet.”

“I’ll start properly in five minutes.”

None of that feels like procrastination in the moment. It feels reasonable. And suddenly I’m running on autopilot.

What helped me was learning to catch those moments instead of fighting distractions after the fact. Productivity became less about forcing focus and more about noticing when my brain was steering without asking.

Reading Your Brain on Auto-Pilot: Why You Keep Doing What You Hate — and How to Finally Stop really clarified this for me. It explains why these automatic patterns show up and how awareness alone can interrupt them - without relying on motivation, hacks, or endless discipline.

First of all, a **big thank you to the entire** r/pmp **community** for sharing experiences, feedback, and motivation. It genuinely helped me a lot during this journey.

I’ll try to keep this structured.  
(If you want to skip the story, scroll down to **Retrospective & Lessons Learned**.)

**Chapter 1: How I prepared… to fail**

Back in **2021**, I honestly didn’t even know what **PMP** stood for. I just filled out the application, got it approved, and thought—*let’s do this*.

I enrolled in my **first Udemy PMP course** and started preparing.  
But the truth? I studied **on and off**, and it took me **almost 4 years** to even complete that course.

Then anxiety kicked in.

Out of pressure, I **booked the exam with just a 3-week gap**.  
I started studying rigorously—**7–8 hours a day**—only to realize something painful:

👉 **I was studying completely wrong.**

So I did what most people do:

* Bought **Study Hall**
* Watched **AR, DM**, and many other YouTube videos
* Followed almost every popular recommendation

My mock scores hovered around **65–70%**, and somehow I convinced myself that it *might* be enough.  
  
Exam Day – Attempt 1

I went in with hope.  
I had already drafted my LinkedIn “I passed PMP” post 😅

Result?  
**NI / A / AT — FAILED**

That hit hard.

The next week was full of **depression, anxiety, jealousy**, and reading posts about how PMP is the worst exam ever created.

I even made a Reddit post back then:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1m2dmur/failed\_in\_pmp\_but\_motivated\_for\_another\_try/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1m2dmur/failed_in_pmp_but_motivated_for_another_try/)

  
**Chapter 2: Be PMP – Adaptive, Resilient, Fail Fast**

I accepted one thing:  
I’m **not a great executor**, but I didn’t want to quit.

I bought the Udemy full course access ( deal) and decided to reset everything.

* **Unfollowed many old / conflicting YouTubers**
* Stopped consuming random advice
* Planned **December 2025** seriously
* Initially planned exam for **4th Jan**

Mock scores were again around **67–72%**.

I felt *okay*, but not confident—so I **postponed by one more month** and booked the exam for **end of January**.

Same routine:

* **5–6 hours daily**
* Revision
* Mindset work
* And yes… praying to every god available 😄

# Exam Day – Attempt 2

* Wore **blue**
* Reached **3 hours early**
* Set 1: very difficult
* Set 2: medium
* Set 3: medium
* **No drag & drop**
* **No numerical questions**

After submitting, I again had cold feet.

Then I saw:  
**BT / T / AT**

I genuinely thought: *“I’m never doing this exam again.”*

But then… 👉 **PASS**

I cried for 20 minutes, turned my phone back on, and celebrated with everyone around me.

Chapter 3: Retrospective & Lessons Learned

1. **Exam Center (Pearson Vue – Center Based)**

* Don’t carry too many items — you can’t even take a **handkerchief**
* Noise-cancellation headphones are provided but uncomfortable → Earplugs are the second option (not very effective)
* If someone is disturbing you (reading aloud, mumbling), **raise your hand and complain** — it’s totally okay
* Carry **protein bars**
* Stay hydrated (coffee / soft drinks helped me)
* Don’t panic if questions feel wrong — it’s just a small % of the exam. **Move on.**

**2. Study Strategy**

* **Quality > Quantity**
* Don’t over-study
* Use **updated material only** (preferably not older than 1–1.5 years)

**3. Resources that helped me personally**

* **EDzest (YouTube)** [https://www.youtube.com/@edzest](https://www.youtube.com/@edzest) Clear explanations, very practical, best for mindset
* **AR – 50 Principle Questions**
* **AR / DM – Drag & Drop**
* **DM – Cheat Sheet (last-week revision)**

Udemy courses I preferred — (screenshot attached)

**Conclusion**

* I studied a lot, but improvement was slow — very demotivating at times
* **PMP is just the beginning**, not the final destination
* Don’t assume “everyone passes”
   * Many failures are not posted
   * Some passing posts are exaggerated or fake
* PMP is **not about knowledge**, it’s about **mindset change**
* The exam trains you to **think like a better Project Manager**, not memorize content

1qsu19o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1qsu19o/are_you_seeking_purpose_of_human_civilization/,are you seeking purpose of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Background: I have df54, at home I mostly drink espresso, occasional pourover. Recently though, management decided that coffee at the office should no longer be drinkable so I want to get something portable for use with, most likely, V60. Maybe I'll get some other brewer if it could help streamlining the workflow. I am also considering occasional use for espresso mayyyybe.

So the way I see it, I have two options:

1. ZP6 for clarity, sacrifice the occasional espresso + df54 for 'dirtier' pourover when I'm in the mood for that.
2. K-Ultra so that I have one typical electric flat burr and one typical conical hand grinder that I can use for both.

I'm just not sure how either of those compare to flat burr like mine and I want to cover as many bases as possible with my next buy, so looking especially for opinions from people who have one of the above + electric flat burr.",0,1769938195.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

So i grew up with a narcissist and alcoholic father, who would beat up my mother for even the smallest of things, and back here in india which is still highly uneducated and misogynistic, dowry related deaths and abuse is still quite prevalent, and i vividly remember the constant beatings by my father to me or my mother, grabbing her hair and dragging my mother in the neighbourhood.  My mother had vitilgo and he always thought that he has done a favour by marrying her, although he agreed to it by his own choice. I still remember those days when my mum would go to the office the next day with swollen face and bruises and would come back in the evening and work like a maid to serve hot food to my grand-parents the MOMENT she arrives back home, and then get beaten up by my father at 9-10pm, and then same office routine the next day.

So one day, the beatings got too much and my grandparents came to take my mother back to their home, bcoz here in india police doesnt do shit and I was maybe in the age of 1 or 2, and just as they were taking us away from my father, he snatched me back forcefully and I remember crying my eyes out and shouting for my mothers name while her forehead was drenched in blood, and so for few months i lived with my father and grandma, until my father begged for forgiveness and things went as they were, alcohol, slut shaming my mother and abuses, the beatings continued and only stopped a few years back, near corona. 

So i was seeing a therapist a couple years back and asked her- why havent i ever been in a relationship in life? 

Why dont i talk to women who show interest in me? 

Why dont i have the basic memories of love? 

And she was aware of these numerous childhood traumatic events of mine, so she said that - you were forcefully abandoned by your mother bcoz of your father, you were abandoned by the person a child feels most safe around- mother.  And that left a lasting impression in your subconscious, and you grew up, wondering, what’s wrong with you? Why did your mother abandoned you ?  What was your fault?     It is also the reason why its  so easy for people to bully you or mock you, so you grew up, thinking that what’s the point in forming bonds/relationships with people when in the end, they will eventually leave you.  So you never gave it a try and went ahead or took steps to form bonds with anyone. 

She explained that it’s not my fault, and I have every right to live a loving happy life, and that i should not feel shame or embarrassment to reach out to people. MAN , the moment i heard these lines , i was absolutely stunned and in a mental paralysis, i couldnt say a word.

Well , to this day, i still never initiate convos but deep down i want to, so badly. God works in mysterious ways man, i am thankfully blessed in looks sector and most people think i have fu\*kboy vibes but in reality only i know why i havent even held hands with a woman romantically. I do get attention and subtle flirts by women but i do not know how to form bonds, ( I would remember the minutest of details about them- what are the favourite hobbies? What shoes were they wearing? What kind of movie or music genre they like? Their subtle quirks,  coffee from a specific place. Favourite future countries to travel to, what calms them or makes them anxious or happy)

i used to and somewhat still do love to go the extra mile to help people in their life regardless of how mean and rude they are to me, why? Why do i care about their small smiles and happiness when they dont give 2 Fuc\*s about me ? 

 Sometimes i wish i was a liar, manipulative A-hole who takes others for granted and deceives them and only care about what i want , i wish i was a selfish prick bcoz in the end - ATLEAST I would have SOME happy memory of someone by fu\*king around and  funny that i only see the As\*holes are happy in life, they deceive , lie cheat to get what they want. Maybe gods plan, what do i know. 

All these years of being introvert filled with guilt and shyness has taken a mental toll and now this cage feels heavy.

1qstyev,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1qstyev/my_current_collection/,My current collection,"In April 2024 I discovered a local decanting website and ordered a bunch of 1ml different fresh scents. The one that immediately stood out to me was ELDO Sous le Pont Mirabeau, never smelt anything like that before. It took me some more time to fully dive into fragrances though; this collection began to form in March 2025. Here it is:

Issey Miyake A Drop d’Issey Eau de Parfum Fraîche - blind bought it bc of the bottle, loved the scent. Gentle, airy lilac after the rain. 

Lush Cardamom Coffee (solid perfume) - an old purchase, still good, the longevity is insane. Coffee is one of my favorite notes in perfumery. 

Montale Ristretto Intense Caffe - a great scent for winter evenings, makes me feel like somebody’s rich aunt haha. 

The Different Company Pure eVe - love using it after shower before going to bed. Sweet, clean and cozy scent. 

Van Cleef & Arpels Thé Amara - nothing too special imo, a citrus freshie for summer days. Projects quite well, got me a ""You smell interesting” comment (still wondering if it was a compliment or the opposite)… 

Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Me Espresso -  wish there was more espresso in it. I’m not a big fan of florals, but this one is nice. Lasts longer than the rest of Sabrina’s fragrances, at least in my experience. The bottle is adorable 🥹

Lattafa Eclaire - liked it at first, then my father said it smells like an old woman, now I can’t bring myself to wear it again lol. It’s nothing like an old woman’s smell though, my dad’s senses have just gotten weird with age 😐

Diptyque Fleur de Peau (hair mist & solid perfume; just ordered an EDP bottle ☺️) - easily one of my favs, this clean muskiness is very comforting. 

Andrea Maack Coven - smells like wet soil and moss in the forest. Wore it only once to a dark folk band’s concert, later it turned out their percussionist wears it too. If you’re a goth, or a witch, or both - this perfume is for you. 

Maison Matine Arashi no Umi - the bottle is cute as heck, the scent is too fruity-sweet for my liking, but fits the mood sometimes. 

Maison Matine Nature Insolente - inoffensive citrusy melon scent, summer vibes. 

Floraiku Spring River - the first floral fluffy musk I’ve ever tried, loved it so much I splashed out on the bottle (only to find out it’s not the fluffiest musk out there…)

Le Labo Lavande 31 - a masterpiece. I love lavender, neroli and white musks, would wear this fragrance everyday if it wasn’t so expensive 😭

Xerjoff Join the Club Fatal Charme - a gift from my parents for my 14th or 15th birthday. Wore it to school almost everyday. Gotta issue a formal apology to my ex-classmates I guess. 

Essential Parfums Neroli Botanica - love the greenery, one of my favorite summer scents. Lasts surprisingly long and projects well!

Kerosene Unknown Pleasures - I love gourmands and I love whatever John Pegg puts in his perfumes to make them last for days. 

Tom Ford Soleil Blanc - reminds me of a (probably discontinued) The Body Shop Polynesian Island Tiaré fragrance, which my mind associates with that one situationship that had altered my brain chemistry. Sometimes I sniff the bottle cap just to feel something 🚬

Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Cherry Baby - a safe blind buy if you like cherries and the bottle design. 

Demeter Fresh Hay - as a proud human of two pet rabbits, I couldn’t resist buying it. Wonder what they think about this scent 🐇

Essential Parfums Bois Imperial - it’s popular for a reason. Not to be one of the basic b-tches, but I’m obsessed with it. A perfect gender-neutral everyday frag, got me a bunch of compliments as well. 

Glossier You - a recent discovery. Man. I want the bottle to be self-refilling. The fluffiest scent ever, comparable to Fleur de Peau, sits closer to skin but whenever others smell it, they love it. 

Jo Malone Forest Moss - smells just like my partner’s shaving cream. We currently live in different cities due to certain outside circumstances, so I sniff this cologne frequently to feel a bit of his presence ❤️‍🩹

Imaginary Authors The Language of Glaciers - I’m a huge fan of the brand’s concept and packaging, and this scent is one of my favs. Smells like a snowy pine forest, unique and unisex. 

Björk and Berries Synchrony - it’s a rainy autumn evening, you’re sitting in a small cozy cafe with your best friends, enjoying some spiced tea with desserts, joking about the silliest stuff. That’s what it smells like to me. 

Björk and Berries Never Spring - this is a lemon lollipop. Nothing impressive, but feels nice to wear in late spring/early summer. 

Vyrao I Am Verdant - it’s So Green! Wish the performance was a bit better. I love smelling like a freshly mowed lawn. 

Etat Libre d’Orange Sous Le Pont Mirabeau - it got me curious about all this perfume stuff. Truly unisex, aquatic, a bit green, kinda reminiscent of pickles 🤌

Zoologist Rabbit - my first and most cherished bottle. Imagine an adorable fluffy bunny baking a carrot cake, sprinkling it with lots of fresh hay, then sitting in a cozy armchair and having a cup of tea. This perfume really does smell of that special place behind rabbits’ ears, but much more amplified and hay-heavy. One of the safest, most wearable Zoologist scents imo. 

Meleg Perfumes Slava Ukraini - as a Ukrainian, I’m so grateful for this one. Smells a bit too sweet, I don’t wear it often, but it’s an integral part of my collection 😌

Apologies for the longread 😅 didn’t expect to write this much, apparently ADHD meds make me lock in for real. Not gonna describe my ~150 decants (but would gladly review some if anyone’s interested hehe)

It was there in the street. Not a remarkable sight. Not even noticeable unless you were looking for it. But he was looking for it. He had to as it started to segment it's way across the neighborhood. From the Johnsons little one story house to Noah's two story castle which wasn't saying it lightly. He had it set up like it was going to be invaded. Motion lights. Sturdy fencing. Beware of dog signs on each side of that fence alongside trespassers will be shot. Enough to make it seem like he was a paranoid recluse. Haverson didn't judge him. He understood. He knew what was out there in the world. At least he thought he did until it showed up in his childhood cul-de-sac. It reflected like a glimmer at first when he noticed it. He brushed it off because it was only a glimmer and nothing stood out. Until that second time when it happened again just days after that first sighting. He had been doing a brisk walk from the park close by to his cul-de-sac. Enjoying the fresh autumn air as he let it saturate his lungs. It had been dusk and the crescent moon starting to rise in the sky. He was whistling softly with his hands in his pockets. His concealed .380 police issued revolver in holster under his armpit. Haverson wasn't law enforcement. Just a concerned citizen. He started to turn the corner of the block, his eyes turning to look ahead and seeing that glimmer again. That same glimmer he saw days before. Only more detailed this time and bolder in color. It was scintillating and with a violet hue to it before disappearing in that instance. 

He paused. Unsure of how to process what he just saw. His rational side wanted to explain it was a hallucination. His intuition overrided it with clear precision asking how a hallucination manifests through a clear head with no prior drug, alcohol, or cigarette use. Not even any prescription drugs and no family history of any mental illnesses. He moved a little closer as he felt something he couldn't quite describe at that moment. Some primal feeling. Something feral but not the cold coil of fear. Haverson came to the spot where he thought it had formed and disappeared. Not seeing anything and only feeling that feral emotion like a lingering sensation from the mere sight of whatever it was. Like it was something he wasn't suppose to have seen. He realized he was subconsciously tightening his hands into fists in his pockets before releasing them and looking around. Seeing nothing else he came back home to his own secure perimeter. That lingering sensation refusing to go away even as he laid in bed and drifted off into a world that wasn't recognizable even in his dreams. All he had were fragements of walking upside down through a forest and that scintillating purple hue flashing every so often in his vision as he walked. 

When he woke up that morning he felt groggy. Not drained or sore. Just like he had been laying in bed with his eyes closed and only that. Not even sleeping as he sat up in bed. That feral feeling a lingering presence in the back of his skull as he looked at the world outside the window from his room to see the cul-de-sac bathed in sunlight. As soon as he stood he had a sudden feeling of something being off. He slowly looked around the room to see nothing. He didn't like this. This wasn't like him, to be cautious in his own house and in his own room. Something was starting in his heart like a cancer. He wasn't dumb. He wasn't naive. He connected the sighting and the dream but at that moment something was blocking him from realizing the full scene of what happened in that dream. Haverson walked barefoot to look at himself in the mirror to see that he was pale but no eye bags. As he looked at his visage in the mirror he noticed something with his eyes as he moved a little closer to it. 

His cobalt blue eyes had been crystal clear. No bloodshots at all. He touched his face below the eyes to pull back the eyelid and saw nothing red at all. Just clear white. Something was off. That feral feeling grew a little more at that realization as he turned on the water in the faucet and turned it to cold and splashed his face with it until he felt clear headed and turned it off. He dried his face off with a towel and looked back in the mirror. His eyes still unusally clear.

Later that morning, as he sat in the silence of his kitchen at the table researching phenomena related to what he was happening, coming upon an article that caught his attention with the sight of someone in it have that pale and cleared eye look, he heard a soft giggle come from behind him. He turned around to see the scintillating purple hue flash brightly right before his eyes and he reacted like he had just been doused with acid as he yelled and covered his eyes as he fell over in his chair. His eyes burned not painfully but with a sickening sense of pleasure and that made his heart beat in revulsion from this foreign feeling. Haverson dared to uncover his eyes as he looked up at where it was and then at where it could be as he stood up with shaking limbs. He glanced around before turning and running to his kitchen drawer where the locked .45 kimber was. His fidgeting fingers misdialing every button until he found the right sequence and pulled the case loose as he gripped the cold metal and felt reality hit him like a grounding relief as he grabbed it and turned around with a pivot and looked desperately for anything and seeing nothing at all. 

He cursed and had a strong feeling to get out of his house. He denied it. Barred it as he went to go check his security alarm and saw nothing tripped it. And at that sight, he knew it couldn't be trusted anymore. He knew what he saw and that feeling wasn't a hallucination. It wasn't imagination. It was real even as he glared at the system with that sickening pleasure still throbbing lightly in his eyes. And then finally he listened to his instinct of getting out and being in the fresh air as he locked the door behind him anyways and zipped up his coat to head to his car. His kimber .45 holstered under his armpit this time. He knew where he was going as he calmed himself. That feral lingering sensation having grown a little more as he noticed it in his chest this time instead of an unarmed emotion. It now had a home.

The stethoscope was strangely like an invasion of cold steel even though Haverson was clear headed now as the last of that sickening pleasure tinged off from his eyes in the waiting room. He looked ahead at one of the unnamed posters on the wall. Reading it and understanding it but not recognizing what it mean as he played that moment of the encounter in his head like something that hooked itself into his hippocampus and made the memory repeat itself again and again even as he looked from the poster to his provider Haley speaking to him in that quiet cadence he grew accustomed to. He shook his head softly as he looked into her chestnut brown eyes, meaning to say he didn't quiet catch that. But she knew already with a faint smile that appeared for a moment before saying in that quiet cadence like an sussuration from an ocean wave.

""Your heart sounds like a metronome, Hal,""

""You sure it's not a Allegro?"" He said with a certain edge to his course and gravel voice.

Haley picked up on that edge and quietly folded her hands together in a calm manner as she looked Hals hands gripping the edge of the procedure chair withe the white of knuckles showing. She also caught the difference in the postures they had and antipode had formed in her thoughts as she looked from his white knuckle grip to his eyes and didn't catch it immediately. Not at first until she was midway through ""What has you-,""

And then it registered as she saw how unusually clear his cobalt blue eyes were. As she paused and studied them with those few silent seconds she also noticed they were moistured over almost like they were glass. Hal squinted at her and started to ask what was wrong before remembering. 

""You see it in my eyes too? How clear they are?""

Haley stood up without answer, not too quick or too slow but in a languid motion that told Haverson she was in her clinical detachment as she turned to the counter and pulled open the cabinet without word. She shut it and turned with a ophthalmoscope in hand as Haverson watched her walk towards him without word until she placed a hand on his shoulder in a grounding motion to let him know she was concerned in a manner that needed no panic. He nodded with acknowledgement before speaking and still not noticing that slight edge in his voice.

""Whatever it is started this morning. I don't think I even slept last night. Just closed my eyes and had some kind of fragmented dream,"" he dared to say because he felt comfortable in her presence and trusted her with confidentiality like this.

She knew his clean history but to cement that fact was his high functioning and ordered way of thinking. But for Haverson there was a hesitation that made him notice the edge, the guarded feeling of his hands gripping the procedure chair and his voice a little more rough than usual. That almost unnerved Haverson in a way that spooked him before feeling the leather under his fingers, sensing his heart beating calmly, and remembering that whatever this was had to be dealt with not in fear. He had a feeling deeper than intuition that the violet hue, that foreign and inexplicable thing would sense and manifest itself right in the room with them. And that feeling almost spooked him again at such an unnatural thought. He breathed as he closed his eyes and felt Haleys fingers tighten around his shoulder.

""Don't worry about the dream,"" she said in that cool cadence he had come to known,""Just tell me what happened when you woke up,""

He felt anger burn slowly but steadily like a fed fire at whatever that violet hue had done during his sleep. For what it had done during that encounter. And for this demeanor that he wasn't accustomed to that almost slipped out.

""I woke up,"" he said slowly and with control as he opened his eyes to her eyes softly holding his gaze with that clinical detachment,"" I felt groggy like I hadn't slept at all. I went to go check on myself in the mirror and saw how clear my eyes were. Washed my face with cold water to wake me up. It was still there,""

She studied his eyes with that clinical detachment and read the control he was presenting and knowing that he was unnerved. Haley knew from experience with other patients. And it wasn't prominent in Hal but it was noticeable and enough to make her feel something start to ravel itself around her chest in an almost barely noticeable embrace. Something with the most faint pulsating warmth. Before it disappeared as soon as it appeared and she stood upright and raised the ophthalmoscope to his retinal and saw that his right pupil didn't retract. She also noticed something about his iris. Something like a splinter of a bloodshot was what she would describe it later in private with her colleagues. Only that was what a lack of words at what she saw as she noticed five more strands in his iris. Extremely needle like and would have been undetectable except for a very faint violet hue to them. 

She looked in left eye and saw the same aberrations. Carefully noting everything that she saw in his iris with detail that would stick with her as she stood up and did something that betrayed her clinical detachment. 

She shrugged extremely uncharacteristically and with a manner that almost unnerved Haverson again as she turned her back to him for a moment that lasted too long for him. Her posture too relaxed. Too calm with her hands in her pockets. And for a moment he thought back to how his hands hand been balled into fists when he saw the violet hue a second time. He didn't like it at all and it made him sit up and ask bluntly.

""What the fuck was that?""

She didn't answer right away but she turned halfway. Her face blank like she had been shell shocked before that clinical detachment filled it within the very second he blinked. She turned to face him and took her hands out of her pockets as she clasped them together in a relaxed manner as she spoke in a manner that betrayed that detachment. Haverson didn't pick up on it at first. He had been to unnerved by that gesture she had done. That look she had before the detachment posture filled that look like a mask that didn't belong, didn't fit, wasn't suppose to have been there at all.

""I'm going to order a sleep study Hal,"" she said,"" I suspect what's wrong with your eyes had been caused from REM sleep that didn't fully saturate your brain in that period of when you had the fragmented dream. Do you have any concerns?""

He stared into her eyes and finally noticed it. He felt his heart start to quicken with an awareness that registered to him as survival as he said nothing. Trying to think. Trying to reason with what he was seeing as he tried to speak without the tongue for it. 

Haley nodded. His silence as confirmation of no further concerns. 

""I'll have you check in with me tomorrow. At 9am. The sooner you come in after tonight's sleep the better and whatever happens during that dream cycle will still be fresh in your memory,"" she said in that manner he still wasn't picking up on as she walked towards him and stopped before him within inches and said ,""I'm concerned Hal and I want you to know that I'm with you in this. Not at this moment but I will be later,"" 

""Sleep study,"" he just said flatly in that gravel voice.

""As soon as I can schedule it citizen,"" she started to place a hand on his shoulder before stopping midway and pausing, tilted her head slightly before nodding and letting her hand recede to her side before meeting his eyes and winking almost like a reflex. 

She started to turn towards the door and walked with exaggerated sways that accentuated her hips and closed the door behind her.

Haverson felt like he had been taken into a world that didn't respond with reason. Didn't respond to the ways he knew anymore. He didn't know what to say or think or do in that moment before grabbing his faded white shirt and putting it on alongside his dark celadon wax cotton jacket and zipping it up in a manner too calm and detached before heading out of the patient room and down the halls by muscle memory more than sight before walking outside into the gray and clouded over world. The fresh breeze of autumn greeting and caressing his face in a way that ground him as he stood and breathed in that air. Let it ruminate in his lungs like a damn good swig of cold water. And when he walked to his Ford crown Victor and touched the handle, it hit him like a clear bullet to his forehead of realization of what that manner was. It was a jubilant euphoria. 

And with that he got in his Ford and sat there trying to find a reason that vanished the moment he opened his eyes this morning. The fragmented dream playing out like a conduit into where he was now.

Part two. Purple Peaks

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night. 

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun. 

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now. 

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his  other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now  delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow. 

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob. 

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer. 
In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.
In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate. 
In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.
In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what  reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table. 

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe. 

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage. 

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable  purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue. 

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration. 

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1769937739.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False
1qstv9t,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.nebulae.ambience,I built an app to mix ambient sounds with a Pomodoro timer and Binaural beats for deep focus 🌿🎧,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a side project I’ve been working on called **Ambience**.

I often struggle to find the right environment for deep work or relaxation. Sometimes silence is too loud, but music can be distracting. I wanted a tool where I could custom-build my own background noise—mixing a coffee shop hum with distant rain, or white noise with a crackling fire—while having productivity tools built right into the same interface.

So, I built **Ambience - Focus, Relax, Sleep**.

**What it does:** It’s an all-in-one soundscape generator that combines high-quality ambient audio with focus and wellness tools.

**Key Features:**

* 🎚️ **Mix & Match:** You can layer over 100 sounds (Nature, Urban, Rain, Colored Noise, etc.) and adjust their individual volumes to create your perfect environment.
* 🍅 **Pomodoro Timer:** Built-in focus timer so you don't need to switch apps to track your study/work sessions.
* 🧠 **Binaural Beats:** Customizable frequencies for meditation or deep concentration.
* 🌬️ **Breathing Exercises:** Guided techniques (like Box Breathing) to help reduce stress in real-time.
* 📶 **Offline First:** All sounds work without an internet connection.

It's free to try, and I’ve focused heavily on keeping the design clean and intuitive.

I’d love for you guys to check it out and give me some brutal feedback. Is the sound mixing intuitive? Are there specific sounds you feel are missing?

**Link:**[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.nebulae.ambience)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his  other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now  delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow. 

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob. 

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer. 
In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.
In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate. 
In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.
In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what  reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table. 

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe. 

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage. 

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable  purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue. 

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration. 

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1769937533.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1qstse6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1qstse6/i_remember_you/,I Remember You.,"I still remember everything you shared with me and every story you did tell. I know you don’t like Spider-man and you feel as if there are much better super hero’s. I also know you don’t like Taco Bell, because your family would get it all the time. It’s sad. Not only that but that don’t have your go to order, which is chicken fingers & fries. 

Your favorite ice cream flavor is cookies and cream. You don’t like Billie Eilish or her music, because you feel like her messages are too forced and they also partially go against your beliefs. You’d carry a conversation, but you wouldn’t be the one to text first. Your favorite colors are purple, green, black, brown, but I’m not sure if maroon is one of them anymore. If you are anything like me, you do like the color pink but you are too afraid to wear it, so purple is the closest you are willing to go. Your birthday falls in the summer and it’s in July, so you’re a cancer. You had a celebrity crush on Pedro Pascal because of a show you saw him in on and you couldn’t remember the name of it. 

You aren’t the first person to speak up in a room, but you are an observer. You’re the type of person to show up whenever it’s needed the most. The way you love is one of the most memorable things I have experienced in these past few years and there isn’t a memory from high school that comes close to how you made me feel. I’ve loved you since I was 18. 

I have this nagging feeling that you watered yourself down to be what you thought I wanted and I mean this in the upmost sincere way when what I wanted- was you. At that moment I was ignorant and I mistook consistency as commitment. I was also scared for a number reasons, I had so many people around me who also liked you and I thought you were the most beautiful woman in the world. I still do. And when I close my eyes, I see the way you looked at me when you first picked me up that day. That was the first time I saw your hair put down and although you wore a sweater- I thought you were gorgeous. Inside and out.

When I watched Fleabag, I cried. And I imagined us owning our own coffee shop together. I thought about what it would be like to around you. Or if you ever thought of me. I can’t really afford to go up to you anymore, or to ask you “Hey, do you remember that you told me you would never leave me?” But I do have enough time to write this. 

I don’t need a reason to celebrate myself this February. However, I did love you. Enough to the point where I listen to One Direction and I know we would have been best friends if that’s all we were. Yet, I have a feeling there’s a reason why we had our private moments in your car. Maybe you just favor secrecy. But I loved you to the point where I wanted to hold your hand in shops, so when people would approach us like how they did at Rocky Mudds- I could just hold our hands up and be like “We’re busy 🙄.” I know it’s cliche, but I wanted to be your girlfriend. 

Apart of me feels as if we are soul mates. My heart stops when I see anyone that looks like you and as I was looking through my old photos from back then, there were so many that had you lurking in the background without me realizing it. Even before I met you, you were there. You held me exactly the way I prayed to god for and it made me feel so complete. The drumsticks that you gifted me made me feel so enlightened as I played, as if someone believed in my dream of being something, or someone bigger than the world before me. 

I understand why you stepped away, 100%. But I can’t stand the thought of you not speaking a word of it. Or whenever I come up to you to talk about it? The fact that you had the ability to tell me that it was nothing more than you showing me a few songs on your playlist broke my heart. I’m sorry for being difficult to love and unhealed in certain aspects, but I couldn’t have brought myself to sign up for college sooner, because I was so stuck up on what you said. It felt like someone believed in me for once in my life and then you told the rest of the world that you never even met me. You will never understand how that felt. 

I get that you wanted me to focus on myself but it shouldn’t have been at the cost of me losing so many fragments of who I am beforehand, just because I chose to believe in what you were saying to me. Sometimes I have dreams of that version of you and whenever I consider that part of my life when I am awake, it makes this wave of warmth wash over me that feels like home. It’s that nostalgia feeling I got in my childhood when something really good was happening and I don’t feel that way with anything else in my life at all. Not unless it’s something really, really big. Like me winning an award. I know I loved you, because my chest still feels something when I think of just your name and I don’t feel that way with anything else in this world. Not even after two years. I love you and I do not regret that. I hope you are living better, now. ",1,1769937456.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1qstrwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1qstrwc/paying_alimony_to_mentally_ill_ex/,Paying Alimony to Mentally I'll Ex,"I'm (41F) at the very end of what I can handle. My ex (45M) developed schizophrenia 9 years ago. We've been together for 24 years. I tried and gave everything I could to support him through it because I loved him, but it's broken me. I now have stress related immune illnesses, cancer, and I also have a chronic illness that causes debilitating pain. 

It was awful. Aside from managing his symptoms, his psychoses as well, I had a life of constant drudgery. He not only never cleaned up but created such an explosion of mess that it was disgusting and unhygienic when I returned from work every day. I was in a state of constant stress having to deal with it.

  
My children, including one young child, were affected, but I couldn't leave as we were trapped by debt that my ex had created. It's illegal to leave with the children against the other parent's wishes. I finally consulted a lawyer and managed to get a report written and submitted to the court, but it cost me thousands so more debt. I was working two or three jobs (around 120%) while caring for the children, the ex, the housework, the paperwork, and being the sole earner while he spent frivolously.

  
Now I am separated (he refused a separation), but I'm forced to pay alimony. As he earns nothing and has medical certificates saying he can't work, the judge has brought me to the bare bones to support him, even though I have full custody. I have nothing. Not even any money for a coffee with a friend or to buy my kid a birthday present. I feel completely trapped. And he's so f\*\*\*ing selfish. He could go and live with his parents but he won't. Instead, he'd rather push his children into poverty.

  
I don't see an end to this, and it's making me feel suicidal. In the country I live in (not the U.S.), this can continue for life even after divorce due to his illness. I feel like I'm dying. My body is giving out - I'm physically sick. I'm also psychologically at the end - so far beyond burnout I can't really describe it. But the court doesn't care. I already submitted medical certificates saying this and my lawyer says the current ruling is actually favourable to me because they allowed me to keep my car because of chronic illness.

Life isn't worth living anymore. If it weren't for my children, I'd just end it.

Has anyone else had this experience, in any country?

I also just hate my ex. He's totally different. The marriage was so abusive towards the end - I was doing 16 or 17 hours of labour a day while he just sat there making mess, calling me a ""monster"" for yelling at him to clear up after himself, and doing his hobbies while I was burning out in front of him while he did nothing to help. I hate him. To see the money that should be spent on my children go to him and push my kids into poverty makes me bitter in a way I cannot describe.",2,1769937407.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

That’s what I did on my first trip too.
This time, I stayed around the Virajpet side instead, mainly because I wanted fewer crowds and more quiet. Honestly, that one decision changed the entire vibe of the trip.
The biggest difference was the pace. No traffic noise in the morning, no rush to leave early to “beat the crowd.” The surroundings were mostly coffee plantations and open land. Evenings felt slow and peaceful instead of busy.

What surprised me was that it didn’t feel disconnected at all. We still went out during the day to explore waterfalls and viewpoints, but coming back to a quieter place made everything feel more balanced.

We stayed at a plantation-style property near Virajpet (INIKA Resorts), and the overall experience felt more in sync with what I personally expect from Coorg, calm, green, and unhurried.

Not saying Virajpet is better for everyone, but if peace matters more than convenience, this side of Coorg is worth considering.

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night. 

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun. 

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now. 

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation.

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again.

In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit. Looking to see that it was completely off but didn't care as he thought about that trance that took him to the end of town and pass the limits where he could breathe. Where he was free of the sickening sensation. It's tenuous hold that had creeped it's way into his being silently but with proclamation announcing itself whenever he disobeyed the hue. 

His uninjured hand touched his heart with care as he tried to think of how he should feel about that trance before tossing that bastard thought out of his head with squeezing his heart firmly. He wasn't stupid. Haverson knew it was showing him what it felt like to leave and then remind him that it can bring him back no matter how much he objected or resisted. It was a reminder and warning that the primal imprint was there inside him. Waiting to remind him with an almost loving warmth that he would be consumed if he went back out of the limits. Even though he felt groggier than yesterday, felt his person being violated and with more open pronunciation, he felt clear enough to foment a memory of Haley swaying with exaggeration. Words passing through his mind like a soft sussuration. 

A tickling sensation began to ravel itself around his heart but Haverson, having felt it made his survival instincts kick in and he did what he could only think of to stop it. He slammed at his chest to make the feeling be equated with that if it didn't stop it. It stopped raveling within seconds like fingers unfurling from his heart in a slow tender manner. For now at least as he breathed with relief and unlocked his house door and locked it again with his keys in hand with fingers that had been tremoring a little. He balled it into a fist as he strode towards his Ford. Summoning the thoughtas and preparations of what he was going to face at St. Annabelle before he caught the Johnson family sitting cross legged on the edge of their cut green lawn with clarity. In this order it was, Rhoda, their adult son Peter, his teenage sister Veronica, then her adolescent brother Nick, the family dogs, Phoenix and Illa, then Mr. Johnson himself with his hands flat on his knees as he stared openly at Haverson with a smile that almost made him go back into house. It was jubilant euphoria captured in a parody of happiness across his curved lips. It was on all of their faces. And as he squinted with a sickening dread building itself back up from the depths of his core, he even saw that the dogs were attempting it too. He felt that dread threaten to paralyze him with a cold terror that started to bubble up almost like a giggle.

He turned away instantly with will power and then got into his car with a slam of the door. Haverson didn't look in the rear view mirror as he grabbed the holstered kimber and placed it on his lap while simultaneously reversing the car out with careful and surprisingly controlled speed before backing up and moving forwards with a momentum that carried everything with a gravity that mirrored what Haverson felt in his entire body as he didn't look back. Forcing his mind to focus on the only thing that made sense even as he knew that reason was no longer alive in the town. The dread being contained with the effort of breathing and exhaling in slow rhythms that helped calm him somewhat. He focused again on what he was going to prepare for and having gotten a mere glimpse of what to expect.",1,1769937320.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

And as the day turned to dusk with the orange dying hue of the sun, Haverson was driving around aimlessly in the town limits. Watching the road ahead, like in a trance, as he turned his head occasionally from side to side. Looking at the buildings, at the people, at the pavement ahead. Studying each of them and not registering any of it. Then he realized as he drove and finally breached the town limits to the grass corn fields outside. Becoming aware as he felt his hands gripping the leather material of the steering wheel tight to the point of aching. He quickly rolled down the window and let in fresh air even as he was pulling over to the side. His chest strangely free of that primal feeling that had made it's home in his heart. It was a lingering emotion that surprisingly made it's insignificant size feel like barbed wire wrapped around his chest in a fierce constructing and constricting coil. Layer by layer by layer until this breach outside the town had unraveled almost all of it but for one layer that remained. That insignificant layer that started back at what it was. Like a ghost of something that imprinted itself from what he saw that night. 

He opened the car door and gagged at experiencing such a sickening feeling. Needing the fresh, clear, clean air that reminded him of who he was. And that's exactly what it did as he looked up at the dying orange hue of the setting sun in the sky. Clear of any clouds until he looked to where the town was to see dark thunder clouds hovering over it. Not a swarm. Not a mass. Just a few that made it's presence known by almost eclipsing the sun. 

Haverson stepped out of the car and placed a hand on the hood as he grounded himself. Looking at the unusual placement of the cloud formation. And something made him reach for his weapon that wasn't there under his armpit. Like muscle memory acting first instead of reacting. Survival instincts. He gritted his teeth for a moment at such an unease, forgetting what had happened earlier for a moment before remembering as he looked at his phone. The time being 5:39pm. This was almost seven and a half hours since he walked out from St. Annabelle in a daze that didn't clear until now. 

""Holy fuck,"" he muttered to himself in a whisper that was low before looking at his left hand still on his side where his heart was.

That feral emotion was tickling as he squeezed his side and closed his eyes. Looking into his memories for anything to help block out that sickening feeling as he found something. He played out the scene of his first love touching his heart and whispering ""someday you'll see what it means to hope,""

Her voice sultry even at that age but warm and filled with a promise of a love that would endure. And in a way it did as he felt that feral emotion retract for now. Loosen it's faint constriction but linger there. He gritted his teeth again and held it as his anger built up second by second. Blossoming like a fire that was sparked from ashes. Feeling it reignite and flourish in his body as he felt an intense hatred for seeing that purple hue that night. Hating every second his eyes laid upon it. His hands curled into fists as he slammed his right fist into his back seat car window with a spider web of cracks that grew again with ferocity until it shattered completely. Haverson's right hand aching significantly and covered in trickles of blood but it didn't satiate him. It only infuriated him as he looked at the broken window and saw himself in the pieces that remained from the weather stripping. And then looked closer at the dim purple hue growing in it before hearing it.

""Consummation,""

Jubilant euphoria snapped into his mind at the sound of a voice that reminded him of those crackheads that giggled to theirselves and muttered inane, incomprehensible things that didn't make sense when he lived in New York. Only it was worse. It was like a hair trigger that unraveled his work and effort at containing that feral emotion and made it more than a presence. It was an invasion as it wrapped itself back around his heart in force and constricted as he grabbed at his heart and braced himself against the car roof. Haverson didn't dare look back as he attempted to fight off that feral, sickening cancer building itself in his heart and threatening to spread out across his chest. The same feeling that he felt when he glanced at that purple hue in his kitchen but so primal it was almost insatiable. Like he felt something akin to peace layered with a dread underneath. A raw, coiling dread like that was the true intention behind that facade of peace. Control. Control over what he felt and needed to stay sane as he staggered to the driver's seat and got in and reversed without looking and coming back into the town with the orange hue now darkened by the thunder cloud formation. Gritting his teeth intensely, holding his heart with his  other hand on the driving wheel. Fighting off that foreign primal feeling until it retreated back to a lingering presence. Unraveling itself, layer by layer as he drove deeper into town. His anger returning but dulled. His sense of that trance slipping into his body like that fresh clean air he breathed in after stepping out of St. Annabelle. His anger and that trance competing for room in his head space. He turned the streets automatically and without even realizing it until he found himself in his cul-de-sac. Parked right in the one way in and out. He stared ahead, fighting that trance and now  delirious surrealism that was creeping into the mix thay made him feel lightheaded. A cognitive overload that was threatening to take his sanity. He didn't have a choice. He didn't even think that long about it. Haverson only thought about returning to his house. In his room. And hoping against hope that he would wake up when he put his head on the pillow. 

He turned into his driveway. Got out of the car without closing the door. His head and body swooning and circulating with a flood of emotion that swayed back and forth with each step towards his locked house door. He unlocked it. Closed it. Locked it again. Then walked upstairs to his room with his shoes and his celadon cotton jacket still on, that trance threatening to take over from the edge of his vision reminiscent of a purple hue as he staggered down the hall with effort until he touched his room doorknob. 

He didn't even remember coming into the room. But Haverson remembered the fragmented dream. Piece by piece. Layer by layer. 
In one segment he wandered down the hall of his house towards the stairs on his hands. Not his legs but upside down and inverted as he walked toward the stairs on his hands.
In the next segment he was having dinner with someone that looked like his first love. Only he could see just their cyan eyes and thin lips. Something that he held in his memories and could just tell from those features alone. Their hands moving towards each other on the white cloth of the table in a motion that was slow and deliberate. 
In the next segment he was in the bottom up forest following the purple hue. Something felt off on his face and he touched his lips to feel them curving upside down. An inversion as he kept following but dragging eager feet that had been resistant to stop.
In the final waking segment he was had been floating above a foundation, looking down at it's clear shape and seeing everything formed and sculpted and with care and precision into curvature. Into repeating rhythms that had went on but stopped near the edges. They were filled a blue hue that had been carried through all the spaces amd crevices of those structures. Shaping into limbs. Taking form before catching the purple hue starting to form within the center of that foundation. Splintering across the structure amd curvature in needle thin cracks that resembled when he first punched his car window with a brutal strike as he later opened his eyes to the faint glow of the ceiling illuminated by the dim light of sun outside trying to peak through clouds.

His shoes touched the wooden floor with a concrete sound of soles making contact with it. He was up and looked around the living room without blinking. His hand going inside his coat to touch where his heart was as he felt it beat rapidly under his hand. The feeling of that feral emotion making it's presence known with a constricting sensation around what  reminded him of the touch he never forgot. And with that he realized his heart was beating in warning of the foreign feeling threatening to make it's cancerous presence grow even more virulent. He slammed his hand against the coffee table and cried out in pain, forgetting that he had broken the backseat car window as blood spattered across the dark almond mahogany table. 

""Motherfucker!"" He yelled in a course gravel voice that tremored with a rage that wanted to breathe. 

To express itself and that's what the fire in his chest did with earnest intention as he flipped the table and kicked at lamp stand with the leg breaking and sending the stand flying as the porcelain lamp landed with a crash as it shattered into fragmented pieces. He raised his left hand to punch at his television before catching himself mid strike. The thought of being careful with his body for what was happening, what he would need it for, struck into his rational side. Restraining the need for the fire to waste away on his own destruction of the house that had been his home, and his parents, and their parents. Holding in, sheltering, birthing memories of six generations of his lineage. 

But he felt extremely violated. He knew he was violated by something that was beyond reason and into a territory that he never imagine he would venture into in all his life. Having whatever that abominable  purple hue was imprint it's essence into his core. That feral and primal emotion of the pleasure that was now tingling in his eyes again very lightly as if the mere thought conjured the sensation into existence again. And he felt the dread underneath it. A threatening and controlling subconscious layer that was waiting for the vulnerability that came with that sickening sense of pleasure. He felt a hypnotic sway start to build itself in his skull as he wiped at his eyes furiously and felt the sensation leave as he opened his eyes again. Blinking rapidly as his eyes cleared free of that feeling. Haverson thought of it as a reminder and warning that even thinking of the purple hue was like an invitation for it. Like a calling that resonated wherever it was. A lure to taste it again.

He shuddered with an intense feeling of revulsion but the feral emotion tickled in response. He gritted his teeth as he shook it off and went to his front door. His mind swirling back to last night. Back to the state of that trance almost threatening to overtake him again. But then paused as he checked the security system out of habit.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This has caused the apartment to have a mouse infestation. I can hear the during the night and one of them crawled on top of my shoulder one night when I was trying to fall asleep.

""I havent seen anything like this all year"" (although the year has just started but still).

1qstiyw,https://i.redd.it/ep2otojzlugg1.jpeg,Met a guy at the gym who offered me a very risky opportunity — am I overthinking this?,"Over the last few days, I met a guy at my gym and we became sort of friends. We usually go to the same gym and the same coffee shop. He started telling me about his life—his ex-wife, kids, blah blah blah.

Then suddenly, he told me about his last job. The guy claims to be an ex-officer, and he explained how he got involved with some drug dealers, how he became a transporter, then shifted to working alone in the field. Eventually, he said he was caught and went to jail because of his activities.

After he got out, he left his city and settled in my city, working a basic job, trying to blend into society and build a clean profile.

One day, while he was telling me about the illegal stuff he used to do and the profits he made, I said that if I were in his place, I probably would’ve done the same thing, but with more caution. That’s when he said, “Why don’t we get into the business together and start working?” He claims the profit is insane.

The thing is, I don’t know much about him other than his name and the stories he’s told me. He says he’s an ex-officer and has a lot of internal knowledge, which honestly makes his story sound very solid. After a lot of planning—how we would do the business, where, and all the details—the plan looks statistically very strong.

But I still have some scenarios in mind:

	•	His story could be true, and the business could go well.

	•	He could still be watched by the cops after getting out of prison (especially since the case he went down for was allegedly big and a lot of people were taken down with him), which means I could get caught too.

	•	He could actually be law enforcement, running some kind of operation, and I’d just be used to catch bigger fish.

BTW, I skipped a lot of details about his life. Based on what he says, his profile, and many indicators, he seems very legitimate—but I’m still hesitant.

Right now, I’m stuck thinking about whether I should step in or step out. Especially since I already have a good job, a good salary, and a family to lose. Still, the profit and the math we did could literally change my life 360.

1qstih6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1qstih6/abusive_people/,Abusive people,"I sort of knew two famous people in 2017- kirk and james of metallica. it was a bizarre situation and I knew them long distance. They did weird horrid things to me long distance and its a long story which i don't care to tell right now. people don't believe me and i'm not sure why. Kirk and james are psychos who do weird messed up things to women and at the time I did put them on dating psychos.

Kirk hammett and James hetfield are predators who target women at their shows. The things they did to me are outrageous and horrible and they disguised it all as I'm lucky because they are metallica to get their attention in any way even if it's crazy long distance weird abuse. They are controlling narcissists and just psychos. this might be somewhat disorganized because I didn't write it in order and I added some things later so I can remember because I wrote a book about it years ago, but took it down and still plan on writing one and need these details which I just won't remember. Kirk and James work together as some dumb duo and screw women over.

I don't get why they did these things to me- lead me on, lied to me, screwed me over, were jerks and other things I can't get into. in 2017, Kirk even told me I was offiicially invited to his house in san francisco, told me his address, and made me fly to go see him.  He promised he'd pay me back. He even said to tell someone at the airport that I was going to ""kirk hammett's' house. When I got to his neighborhood, there was a young guy there with his friends telling stories about how he knew Kirk Hammett. I was just thinking ok this isn't a good sign.

When i got there, he wouldn't open the door but kept saying he would. He kept telling me ""go back, I'll open it I promise"" and made me do this like 20 times or who knows. Then he put books and towels under his gate several times as a sick joke, and 'turned some water on' in the yard and later mocked me saying he turned the water on. I was in horror and confusion and figured he'd eventually open the door. I was like what would he get by doing this.  I flew six hours and either was stupid or confused or trusted him. He was like a long distance abusive friend or something weird. They think they are metallica and that I was lucky to get their attention in any way even if it was being stood up. Rob or lars werent involved but knew what was going on. Kirk said lars helps him out sometimes. at the time I kind of trusted them because I figured they were famous people but I shouldn't have.

They saw me at their first show- i was right near the front. I had no idea they target people at their shows. They are predators actually. When I went to their second show,  james began singing to me and some guy got jealous and came and knocked me out. I was so humiliated when it ended, I just took off though I was supposed to meet them there.  Had I met them at their dumb show I'd probably be married to james. They did this kind of stuff to me because I didn’t know them in person because I never went to meet them. they are usually nice to women I think and began playing some stupid game with me which I was confused about.

Actually, after their first show, I was hanging out in the audience, and they were just on stage meeting random people and I noticed they seemed like predators the way they were scouting the audience. I just thought- creepy they're scouting the audience for sex puppets or something how weird. I just thought- they wouldn't like me so I took off but apparently they did. Had I met them, i'd probably be married to james or i would have at least been his girlfriend. Kirk and James were the ones who chased me and they have a lot of girlfriends and groupies.

Kirk invited me to go watch him speak in salem in 2017, and had a salem exhibit there, but I didn't think he'd meet me and I didn't trust the situation so I didn't go. He made me watch videos about the exhibit and seemed somewhat upset I didn't go. After that, they began being jerks to me long distance and kept leading me on about meeting them. Kirk made me drive to miami once too claiming he'd meet me at a hotel. It's not that I wanted to meet them they were just leading me on and lying to me. Kirk told me he was 'keeping me on a string' for james, and he was the one I was in contact with for a year. I'm surprised james is dating someone named adriana because after his divorce he was supposed to somehow contact me and meet me and get with me in some way. The things they did were unfair and outrageous. james may have even got a divorce because of all of this- i can't say why but there are reasons. I mean I can't be sure of that but part of it may have been because of this situation. They were playing some kind of sick game with me long distance and they found it all fun.

They took this stupid game seriously, and there's a lot to it.

Kirk told me I was the fifth member, then they purposely officially made lady gaga the fifth member on purpose just to screw me over and they found this fun. They even made frineds with dave mustaine I think as part of this dumb long distance metallica game. Kirk said i'd sing with them on stage but they sang with other people, and Kirk said he'd make me famous on metallica's twitter and hand me a check one day, but he didn't, so they purposely put others on their twitter just for fun to screw me over and try to make others famous or just put them there but not me. They did all of this for fun and once or twice lars helped them out. It's like some weird inside thing between us which makes no real sense.

At first, they wanted to meet me, but then they just found it fun to screw around and Kirk enjoyed dominating me for some reason the way they were doing it. I regret not meeting them at their first show, then they wouldn't have done all these things to me. Then they just enjoyed this weird game they were playing with me. I was just confused and didn't understand most of what was going on.

Its a long disturbing story. Kirk posted things on his twitter based on conversations we had too, so did james hetfield on metallica's twitter. Once in a while james will secretly post things on metallica's twitter that pertain to the dumb crap that happened between us which wasn't interesting. Once I told kirk i liked science so he and lars went to CERN and did a science video and he made me watch it. kirk and james created the 'hetfield hammett experience' and me and kirk would make fun of james and call him old. I was kind of pissed as to why they never invited me to metallica headquarters amongst other things at the time. Kirk used to make me watch videos of him acting as if I wouldn't be attracted to him. They were just very arrogant narcissists.

Kirk invited me to go on tour with them at the time, but didn't really try to make it happen. they just seemed to enjoy messing around with me in some way. Kirk was my  best friend for a year long distance in 2017. Kirk even made it seem like he was really upset and sad I wasn't with them on tour but he didnt even know me and it didn't make sense. He acted like he had deep feelings for me. He said metallica was nothing without me and that I owned metallica. Due to the nature of what happened, a lot of what metallica still does has to do with me or it used to. Kirk said he used to think about me 24/7, so he did bad sh\*t to me so that I'd think about him 24/7 too. none of it made sense.

Kirk at the time wanted me posting on forums and on youtube what was happening to me and what they were doing to me to get attention, but no one cared or i got banned. He wanted me telling my dates that metallica was stalking me. Kirk made me do these dumb videos about what was going on and it was just a video of a steering wheel usually because I was in my car talking about what Kirk was doing to me. Kirk wanted me telling people about what was happening so I'd get youtube views, but no one cared and he wanted me doing updates too. Then kirk created his portals videos and in some video there is just someone driving and a steering wheel- he did this because it emulated the dumb videos he'd make me do.

Kirk even once had me write about this on a few websites and got me followers on one website. James wrote a book because I’m a writer too this was several years ago.

Kirk promised me a mercedes and house in san francisco and would give me fake credit card numbers to use and pretended he was going to buy me things from IKEA or best buy. He would create meet and greets and try to get me to get a ticket to go meet him but i didn't try or care.

Kirk one day told me to get a ticket to metallica night in 2018 and said he'd be in VIP. He literally made me get the ticket but because of other reasons I couldn't go. I think that was the time we were possibly supposed to meet or they just wanted me watching them as usual. I did go to metallica night in 2019, for other reasons and lars and rob were in VIP and they knew who I was I can't say how and just stared at me and nodded. When Kirk/James were on the field, they both stared at me and james waved at me and did some weird gesture. I was confused at the time.

Finally, kirk showed me how to get a ticket to meet him at some meet and greet out of my state only because he wanted to meet me, and i just did it so I could tell him to leave me alone or I was hoping he'd treat me with respect if he sort of met me in person. He just stared at me, gave me a dirty look and squinted his eyes when i entered and I told him to leave me alone and he just nodded his head. nothing really happened and I just figured they were jerks and creeps. Kirk used to say that if he met me in person he'd still abuse me. We talked on the phone twice in some strange manner, and i figured out how to delete his voicemail messages from his friends. Kirk did have me take some pics in lingerie and send them to him through text. Me and kirk and james had 'songs' and mine and kirk's songs were moth into flame and some other one I can't remember and mine and james songs were from whom the bell tolls and battery.

I think at the time kirk/james were infatuated with me and its a long story. They literally cancelled their australian tour because of something that happened to me and i cant get into it and finally played in australia recently. They used me as some muse and kirk wont even update his twitter anymore because of all of this. There's a lot more that happened and I can't get into it. They are creepy people and i cant even get into the details. It's a weird situation and is deep and because of how they screwed me over they paid me some kind of homage through their band in different ways, though they did that before they screwed me over too.

They played in abu dhabi on december 6th, because my birthday is december 8th and because I'm associated with the country in some form. They did lots of things like that in the past and played in rockville daytona years ago because its a festival i always go to and they had never played there before. They did a lot of things that were associated with my life i can't say how because i can't reveal some things about them as well due to this being reddit. They created a coffee and skateboard company because of two people in my life long story.  I used to tell kirk that he'd fall on stage years ago, so he and james purposely fell on stage and it was advertised in places. James called himself ""old"" on stage several times years ago- that's because I used to call him old. They did this kind of stuff regularly in the past- and found it all fun. if you ever hear James years ago on stage saying ""I think I'm just old"" it has to do with this. It's like some sick twisted game they were playing at first and there's a lot to it.

I'm not sure why they did these things to me. Kirk said they wanted a 'connection' to me not sure why and other weird things. He also said they wanted me 'chasing them at their shows and in the audience' and I didn't have any interest in chasing them at the time. They saw me at their show in 2017. I was supposed to marry james but after his divorce, he began dating some random female, and they ghosted me in 2018. After a year of crap they did to me, they ghosted me and stopped talking to me out of the blue. Kirk used to say it was just 'me him and james' and that we'd have a threesome at metallica night which never happened. in 2019 i went to metallica night for some other reason, and I was in the stands, and kirk and james both stared at me and james waved to me in some way. I forgot about them but sometimes I still think about the weird sh\*t they did to me and it goes deeper than that, and they def still think about me but not sure wtf was going on.

They used me as some 'muse' and screwed me over and kept paying homage to me in all kinds of ways through 'metallica' and the band. At first, they did want to meet me and they did even a year later, but then they were just interested in screwing around. Kirk even started dominating me in some form. If I would have chased them in some way we probably would have met, not that I really wanted to meet them either. I just regretted not meeting them at their first show because then they wouldn't have done all of these things to me.

When I do think about them then I think about the long drawn out story that made no sense and that I can't remember much of but I just wonder why that jerk kirk talked about how I didn't deserve to marry him or deserve half his fortune and it made no sense. Kirk said i'd never feel sexual or enjoy sexual pleasure unless I met him but we did finally meet and he didn't really care. I don't even hate them because of how disturbing the story and situation was overall. Everytime I hear about james and adriana it bothers me and i'm not saying they really give a crap about me anymore or ever did- maybe in the beginning they sort of did, but part of james being with adriana is flaunting that he's with this other female, secretly. I can't describe it but im not saying they desire me anymore or anything, it might be some kind of narcissistic control like oh I got with her so suffer maybe a little bit of it. anyhow, they are jerks and psychos who really f\*ck people over. James is just old and i didn't like them anyway I just didn't think they'd lead me on and screw me over the way they did. I dont' get what they'd want anyway- some kind of dumb control over a female.

there will always be this stupid connection to them and this awful long intricate situation.  For people who are like why would they even like you- i cant get into why but there are reasons. Actually this is one of the most bizarre stories to exist and those metallica morons aren't forgetting it either. They have groupies and girlfriends, and james current girlfriend was just a random female. I found one of their groupies online once and kirk threatened me to never talk to her. Due to all of this I just regret not being married to james. I just wish I would have met them at their first or second show for lots of reasons. I feel kind of upset if I hear about james and adriana and think that should be me. I think about them sometimes and when I do i just freak out and think about the story and its not a good situation or experience.

kirks portals video- one of them i cant remember which one is actually just a steering wheel or someone driving. that's because kirk used to make me do videos about this and post them and the videos looked exactly like that- just a steering wheel. Thats how deep this crap goes and how weird these people are.

If you go to Kirk's twitter- it hasn't been updated since december of 2022, and the last posting was of a mercedes. That has to do with this situation and that creep Kirk just won't update his twitter now. Kirk and James both banned me from Metallica's twitter and Kirk's fearfestevil, and metallica's instagram, just for fun just to make it more real since we don't really know each other in person and that's part of this sick twisted game they did to me, though they did want to meet me in the beginning. There is more but I can't remember it.",1,1769936473.0,Rants,0,0.67,False

My brother and I are still not feeling good either. The only person who feels okay is my mom who’s a nurse so that doesn’t surprise me. Finding out that we were all feeling the same sense of nausea sent me into a full blown panic. I nearly passed out, and uncontrollably shook for a while. I managed to calm my self down and have basically accepted my fate, whatever it is. If we’re all sick then there’s nothing I can do to prevent it nor will I go out of my way to try and reverse it.

I’m normally healthy and active and have a good head on my shoulders but now have some bad thoughts - trying to combat them.

I hope writing this out will help

—————————

I’ve had 2 decent relationships, one for 4 years, another for 11 mos - ended in Nov25. It was an amicable breakup - didn’t take long to recover.

I matched with a guy on Hinge a few days after and starting chatting, told him upfront I wasn’t ready for anything serious yet. He said he’s the same as he ended his first, 5 year relationship in Sep 24- another relationship was the last thing he wanted.

We chatted for 2 weeks then he proposed we meet. It went really well, We chatted + had dinner. We discovered our exes are actually dating.

We met 2x for coffee and spent few hours at the park one time. I was keeping a lot of physical boundary because I wasn’t sure what I wanted and wasn’t initially attracted to him romantically/sexually.

I took a 7 day trip-came back, and he asked to have a dinner + Netflix at his place. When watching Netflix I tried to keep a distance but eventually gave in as he continued to get closer. We cuddled and kissed. He wanted to get into my pants but I said it’s too soon, he respected that but it was a really intimate time with a lot of emotion -I haven’t felt this for so long, barely even in my past relationships. That was a turning point and I started having interest in him.

We then spent another day together, beach in the afternoon, dinner, then a sleepover. I told him I didn’t want sex that night , but the next morning we ended up giving each other BJs.

We’ve been texting the whole time - I noticed some distance afterward. We both went away for a week during Xmas and his replies slowed down, and weren’t as detailed as his initial Hinge texts.

I noticed my romantic attachment, showing signs of interest in him over text and the next few times we met once we returned to the country, but got some “whatever” responses from him. E.g. I texted “you now live in my head rent free”, he replied after leaving as seen for 7 hours - which has never happened, “does that make me a squatter?”; I asked if we could see each other more often, he said “yes”, then said “but not too often.”; I told him I’ve deleted all my apps while he’s still on hinge/tinder and said “but not doing anything”. We recently had a long weekend. He didn’t offer to spend time with me despite I’ve asked him 4 days in advance. I offered to move my schedule around to meet.

And during some of these meetups, we gave each other BJs , and we’ve been texting daily, saying good morning/night. I’ve been wanting to figure out where this is going. It’s been roughly 1.5 months since we first saw each other.

Couple days ago, I asked to catch up and he suggested a beach evening. We went to the beach, chatted about work, colleagues, investments, family, travel, about the previous long weekend etc.

The night went by but I couldn’t hold it in anymore. When I dropped him off at his place, I asked: “I know I wasn’t looking for anything serious when we first met but realised my priorities have changed. Would you be open to something more serious or still want to keep things casual?”

He said he could sense my emotions and was initially confused during the first few dates because I was being distant physically despite mentioning wanting something casual.

He thought casual meant hookups - which he admitted he never does it normally (so I was the exception besides his ex). He doesn’t have Grindr, rarely meets people from the apps, except me and his ex. He also hasn’t met anyone since me, and I was the only one who moved past first date since his ex.

He said he has feelings for me, but was a bit shocked when he saw my tinder profile (we met on hinge but had matched on tinder but never spoke ). There were some sexual emojis in my profile (that was my post breakup era), and he was a bit shocked/confused, and believed I was only looking for something casual.

He said he’s thought of all these amazing trips and adventures we could’ve done together, I was actually surprised - I hadn’t been thinking that.

The final blow was he said he’s definitely interested in me, and needs a long time to develop romantic interest, and he’s“not there yet”. He said a guy was interested in him before but he wasn’t, but after a while it reversed-he started wanting a relationship sadly the guy had already moved on. He said he’d been hoping to have a chat with me, to tell me to take it slow/easy and was glad I raised it first (he couldn’t explain clearly so i helped me finish). However I feel like if I was the right person, he could’ve said “we can work on something slowly”.

He asked me what I wanted, I was heartbroken and told him I won’t see him again. I won’t block him on my social media , and he said “please don’t block me”, we will bump into each other around workplace anyways. He said we could stay as friends and said if I changed my mind let him know. I said yeh let’s not be strangers but it would hard to hang out as friends.

That night we had minimal messenger exchanges. I sent him some photos of him at the beach, and said whoever gets to date him is very lucky. He said he’s really sorry. Next day he texted me back saying he really appreciated the time back that liked the time we spent together, and was glad we met. We left it there.

It’s the most gut-wrenching not knowing why he doesn’t want more - I felt he’s definitely interested, but doesn’t want a relationship yet. I kept thinking what “could’ve happened”, and have been in a spiral since . I’ve never been rejected before. Every night I wake up at 3am with nightmares about him and feeling shit.

What’s the cheapest way to do this that still tastes good?,"I’ve been seeing protein coffee everywhere lately, but most of the products seem expensive compared to just drinking coffee and getting protein elsewhere. I wanted to break this down by what actually matters for eating cheap and healthy: cost per serving, calories, protein, and whether it replaces something you’re already buying like creamer or a separate snack.





\- DIY coffee + protein powder: Usually the cheapest per serving, but mixing can be hit or miss and hot coffee tends to make texture and taste worse.

\- Protein creamer added to coffee: More convenient than DIY, but calories can add up quickly depending on how much you use.

\- Laird Superfood Protein Coffee: I came across this recently and thought it was worth mentioning. Its more expensive per serving than DIY, but it combines coffee, protein, and creamer in one step and tasted better to me than most DIY attempts. 

\- Coffee alternatives like MUD\\WTR: Often compared in this space, but not really protein-forward and usually better evaluated as a coffee substitute rather than a protein source.



For anyone who’s actually compared cost per serving over time, what’s been the best protein coffee setup for you that balances price, taste, and convenience?",18,1769936148.0,EatCheapAndHealthy,10,0.83,False

Her name was Diane. Unit 4B, directly across the hall from where I live (4A). We’d lived in the same building for three years — pleasantries by the mailboxes, complaints about the superintendent, the kind of neighborly rhythm you don’t think about until it stops. She was retired. Kept a cat. I can’t recall its name.

I don’t walk at night. I work from home for a data entry, logistics company and my routine hasn’t changed in two years. Up at seven. Coffee. Laptop. Bed by eleven. I don’t sleepwalk. At least, I never have.

 

I knocked on her door the next morning. She answered it but with the chain on, her face tight in a way I hadn’t seen it before. Not anger. Something else.

 

“Diane, I got your note. I think there’s been a misunderstanding.”

 

“I hear you every night,” she said. “Between three and four. Walking back and forth in the hallway. Just back and forth.”

 

“That’s not me.”

 

“It’s your door that opens.”

 

She shut the door in my face. Didn’t slam it. Just shut it, carefully, then I heard the deadbolt turn.

 

 

I set an alarm for 3:00 AM that night. Sat on my couch in the dark, watching the front door. Nothing. At 3:47 I went back to bed feeling stupid.

 

The next morning, another note.

 

\*You did it again. \*

 

I bought a security camera — cheap, the kind you mount with adhesive strips. It took two nights to arrive, two more to set up properly. By the time it was up, Diane had stopped answering her door. Her mail started piling up in the hallway box. Catalogs mostly. A couple of envelopes from what looked like a pension office.

 

For four nights the footage showed nothing. Empty hallway. My door, shut. The timestamp ticking forward in silence.

 

On the fifth night, at 3:14 AM, my door opened.

 

 

I watched it six times before I accepted what I was seeing. The deadbolt turned — smoothly, cleanly and the door swung inward. It stayed open for exactly forty-one seconds. Then it closed. The deadbolt turned back.

 

Nothing entered the hallway. Nothing left my apartment. The door opened and closed, from the inside, on its own.

 

I had a locksmith replace the entire mechanism that afternoon. New deadbolt, new knob, new strike plate. Two hundred dollars down the drain. He tested it twice before he left.

 

That night, at 3:14, the new lock opened.

 

 

I started reviewing the footage frame by frame, slowing it down. That’s when I noticed the vibration — the hallway light fixture, a cheap fluorescent panel, trembling at 3:13. One minute of fine, rapid shaking, like something heavy shifting its weight nearby. Stillness. Then the lock turned.

 

I checked all five nights. The vibration was there every time. Exactly one minute before.

 

I called the superintendent. He sent someone to look at the door frame, the hinges. The guy shrugged, said everything looked fine. I didn’t show him the footage. I don’t know why.

 

The forty-one seconds started to bother me. I timed it across eleven consecutive nights. Not a single variation. Whatever was happening, it was precise. It was doing exactly what it intended, for exactly as long as it needed to.

 

So, I started measuring. Forty-one seconds to walk to the end of the hallway and back? Twelve. To the stairwell? Eighteen. To Diane’s door and back? Six.

 

None of it added up.

 

Then I tried something else. I stood in my hallway and simply waited, counting in my head. Forty-one seconds of standing still, breathing slowly. It felt like the length of time it takes to settle back into sleep after being woken up gently. The length of time a body needs to go quiet again.

 

The door was not opening so that something could leave or enter.

 

 

I left notes for Diane after that. Slid them through the gap in her mail slot.

 

\*Did you hear it again last night? \*

 

\*I have it on camera. It’s not me. \*

 

Nothing back. Her mail kept piling up. On a Saturday I knocked hard, three times, and pressed my ear to the wood. I stood there for almost a minute. I almost called building management for a welfare check, but something held me back — not concern, exactly. Something closer to certainty. Like I already knew she was fine. Like I knew she was on the other side of that door, inches away, and had simply decided not to open it.

 

I left her alone.

 

 

On November 9^(th) I came home from the grocery store and found my apartment door unlocked. Not open. Unlocked. Middle of the afternoon. The deadbolt was in the open position, the knob turned slightly, like someone had just let go of it.

 

I stood in the hallway for a long time before I went in.

 

Nothing was out of place. The laptop on the desk was closed the way I’d left it. The glass in the sink was the one I’d used that morning. But there was a smell — faint, and wrong in a way that took me several minutes to place. I stood in the middle of my living room and breathed through my nose until I got it.

 

It was the smell of sleep. That close, warm, skin-and-breath smell of someone who has been lying down for hours in a still room. A body at rest.

 

My bed was made. Sheets pulled tight, the way I always leave them. But when I lifted the comforter, the mattress was warm. Not room temperature. Body warm. Like someone had been lying there for a long time and had gotten up only minutes before I walked in.

 

I hadn’t been sleeping alone.

 

I didn’t know for how long.

 

 

I moved out two days later. Didn’t break the lease properly — just packed what I could carry in two trips and left. Didn’t tell the superintendent. Didn’t tell anyone.

 

I want to be honest about what I believe, because I know how this sounds. I am not a superstitious person. I don’t believe in ghosts or hauntings or any of that. I think there is an explanation for everything that happened in that apartment. Something structural, something about that building, something I didn’t understand. Probably boring. Probably mechanical.

 

I set up the same camera in my new place before I finished unpacking. Same angle, pointed at the front door. I set an alarm for 3:00 AM every night. I sit in the dark and I watch the door and I wait.

 

For the first three nights, nothing happened. The door stayed shut. The lock stayed still. I started to feel normal again. Started to think I’d gotten away from it.

 

This morning, I woke up at 6:41, an hour something before my alarm. I laid there for a moment, and then I noticed it — the sheets on the other side of the bed.

 

They were pulled back. They were pulled back carefully, the way someone leaves them when they don’t want to wake up the person next to them.

no collapse.

1qst9vl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qst9vl,Launched: Free open source e ink PT dashboard! (Use Trmnl or old Kindle),"I built a transit display that does all the thinking for you — routes, weather, coffee timing, everything so you can have your quintessential Melbourne morning thought process done for you!

I got tired of the morning mental math. Checking when the train leaves. Figuring out if I should catch the tram to the station or just walk. Wondering if I have time to grab a coffee. Forgetting my umbrella.

So I built Commute Compute — a smart ecosystem that calculates everything that handles all of it.

The display sits on your desk (or wall, or kitchen bench) and shows you one thing: when to leave. That's it. No apps. No route planning. No decisions.

It pulls live data from tram tracker, train networks, and bus services — all unified into one view. It knows your walking pace, your usual stops, and your destination. It calculates the optimal route across modes automatically.

See a coffee cup on the screen? You have time to grab one. See an umbrella? Rain is coming. The display makes the decision so you don't have to and automatically recalculates your journey if there are disruptions or delays!

What I built (after over 200 hours of dev and many many late nights):

• Real-time integration across trams, trains, and buses 

• Multi-leg journey planning with live departure data

• Weather-aware (umbrella indicator when rain is forecast)

• Coffee Decision engine (calculates if you have time before your connection using real-time data to assess how busy the cafe is

• E-ink display that refreshes every 20 seconds

Fully open source. The entire system — backend, renderer, journey calculator — is free to use, fork, and modify.

Currently runs on TRMNL e-ink hardware (800x480). Adapting it to other displays is straightforward. - I built custom firmware to convert your old kindle to work too!

(I was busy all day so I didn't update you guys yesterday) 



So yesterday was our school farewell. I was all dressed up, excited but also nervous about how the day would go.

I entered the school with fake confidence and then… I saw her.

She was wearing a black saree and, God, she looked absolutely stunning. My heart genuinely skipped a beat. We made eye contact. She smiled slightly. I smiled back, blushing like an idiot.

After the entry, tags, and all the formal stuff, she performed on stage. She danced, and I couldn’t stop looking at her. Later, after food and cake cutting, everyone was vibing to songs. She was dancing in a group with her friends, and I was just standing there, blank.

I wanted to talk to her. I wanted to apologize for how I had behaved earlier, for shouting at her that day. But my brain was busy overthinking everything.

Finally, I gathered all my courage and politely asked her,

“Hey, can you come with me for a minute? I want to say something.”

She agreed and followed me. We went to a quiet corner near the stairs. I told her I was really sorry, that I shouldn’t have shouted, that my words were wrong. I said I knew it wasn’t easy to forgive someone like that.

And then… she surprised me.

She immediately forgave me. She held my hand. The moment felt heavy and soft at the same time, eyes shining with unshed tears. 

She told me she had already forgiven me, and that seeing me apologize like this made her really happy. .She said she was waiting for me to take the first step, while I was just overthinking everything.

We hugged. Like, actually hugged.

We were still holding hands when a group of girls walked by, so we separated, and she ran off blushing. I stood there smiling like an idiot. My heart felt so light, like a weight I didn’t know I was carrying had disappeared.

The rest of the day felt unreal. We danced together, made a reel, and I even dropped her home. I thought about asking her out for coffee, but it was already 8 PM and her parents were calling, so it didn’t happen.

Maybe someday I’ll ask her out properly.
But for now, I’m just happy.🩷✨🤩

TL;DR:
Met her at our school farewell, apologized for past behavior, expected awkwardness but she forgave me instantly, held my hand, hugged me, and admitted she was waiting for me to make the first move. The rest of the day was pure happiness.

Started methylphenidate and it sort of feels like a sugar pill until I realize how much my anxiety has gone down, and that I’ve been able to actually read my school textbook for awhile even though it’s hard and not fun, which usually feels impossible (so I often didn’t do it). Now I can just sit down and…do the task. Wild.

Before dx and meds, I self-medicated with copious amounts of espresso, sugar, carbs, and shopping. I used to live life with the only motivation being that I’d get to wake up and have a bucket of sugar coffee and maybe buy something online later in the day and then get another thing full of sugar, rinse, repeat till bed time. I don’t really want any of that now and so I’m feeling kind of lost. This sounds stupid but like. What do I do now?…Does it get easier?

My family is also fairly against us having any diagnoses of any kind because that would mean we aren’t normal and we just HAVE to keep up with the Joneses, we HAVE to be perfect and show no weakness. My mom has the most extreme hyperactivity I’ve ever seen, worse than me, and she doesn’t seem to realize. She doesn’t even like the thought of me going to therapy. Now I’ve been seeing my psych who is wonderful and I feel listened to and seen and it’s awesome, it’s just that I feel like maybe I’m a big faker imposter (even though I took an objective computer test) or at least that’s what I think my mom will say, or something about how I just wanted drugs (I’ve never done anything illicit in my life, never felt the urge, and at most take spiro for my acne which she’s still weird about, plus all the Concerta does is let me read without getting up every 5 minutes). Not really sure how I’m going to tell her, if I even can. But I feel like a big ole liar?

Anyway, just feeling a lot of feelings, good, bad and neutral. Mourning the years and time I’ve lost because no one noticed I was struggling but so happy I’m advocating for myself now and getting the help I needed.

Cheap machines are made in similar factories, so don't be fooled by brand names like breville and delonghi, they may have better customer support but you pay way more than the machine is worth it ($50 machine ends up being $150)

Ask to see the box, on the side of the box they list all the features which tell you more or less what you get.

\-Look for features, don't buy machines with small build factor as they break way sooner.

\-Get a machine with a large water tank, 1.5L+  
\-Read the power rating, don't get anything weaker than 1000W. My current machine has 1450w and I am happy with the steaming power.

\-Get one with 20 bar pressure (no, it isn't the coffee pressure, but the pump pressure. Anything less than 20 bars will make it hard to get 9+ bars when brewing coffee)

\-Go for one with 58mm basket size, usually they are made to be more like ""prosumer"" machines and are built better  
\-Get one with a steam wand that isn't thin and where you can clearly see the shaft and the steam wand tip. The ones with smooth cylinder are automatic frothers, and will make your life harder.  
\-Look for ones with pressure gauge, it may not be indicative of the pressure on the puck, but you can use it to compare shot to shot  
\-Look for one with physical buttons, avoid touchscreens and flat buttons, they break too quickly

\-Look for pressure relief system  
\-bonus if it has backflush capability

\-Avoid grinder and espresso machine combos, they are easier to break and give you less flexibility to adjust.

\-Overheating and over pressure protection are also a must  
\-Look at the pics, it must have portafiler spout that looks like professional machines, it usually means they made it for people who want more than a starting machine)

\-opt in for thermoblock over single boiler, they provide much better steaming capacity

\--------------------------

my machine is called geepas 41519 but you can't buy it as it is a local import with a fake brand name (you can't find this exact model on geepas uk website) but you can google the name to see how it is built, looks will get you 60% of the way into finding a decent espresso machine.

Now for some of the problems I faced with my machine. For a white I struggled with getting a decent crema from my shot, and unless my coffee was too fresh, my crema wouldn't last and the color was too light. I then tinkered with it and spoofed the thermistor with a variable resistor (currently set to 300ohm) to make the machine hotter, which resulted in tastier cups, double the crema that is longer lasting and deeper in color.

For the grinder I am using a stepless 600n grinder, why I choose it is because it uses a flat burr, which is more reliable at budget machines, but I had to manually calibrate it and adjusting the grind is done with slight movement so it is much harder to use, but that was a price I was willing to pay since it was $35 at the time.

He treats me well and likes me, but I now feel emotionally unsafe and don’t know if this is just a rebound or something that can be fixed.

I (31F) started dating a guy (32M) about a month ago. Things were going really well – he treated me amazingly, was very affectionate, talked about the future, included me in his life, and two days ago he asked me to be his girlfriend and we became exclusive.

Then literally the next day he told me he wanted to talk and said he’s still thinking about his ex (they broke up about 2.5 months ago and were in a 7 month relationship). He said he feels emotionally blocked, guilty, and like he’s “pretending”, even though he really enjoys being with me and cares about me. He cried and said he doesn’t want to hurt me and probably needs to be alone.

This completely shocked me because his actions before that were very consistent and loving. He makes me coffee, cooks for me, cuddles me and calls me beauty, talks about trips together, plans dates, etc. He doesn’t act cold or distant at all. Since the beginning he has said he’s looking for a lifelong partner.

I told him that simply thinking about his ex does not worry me and he shouldn’t feel such a strong guilt as it has happened to me too. I said it’s okay for me as long as he wants to be with me and suggested trying to continue but without this pressure/ guilt he feels. He agreed and we spent the night together, somewhat awkwardly at first but then laughed, cuddled warmly etc.

However, I now can’t fully relax around him anymore. At the same time, I like him a lot and feel very attached. He says he loves spending time with me and loves everything about me, he hasn’t felt such a connection in a while. I’ve been very understanding, but I’m scared I’m going to be hurt.

Running a small food spot—whether it’s a cozy cafe, food truck, hole-in-the-wall eatery, or family restaurant—is tough enough without paying monthly fees for clunky POS systems that require constant Wi-Fi or expensive hardware. In 2026, with costs still high and margins tight, I built a completely free, 100% offline Android app called MetaNest Quick POS & Billing to fix that.

It’s ad-supported (AdMob only, non-intrusive), no subscriptions, no data collection, no cloud dependency—everything stays local on your device for privacy and speed. Works on any cheap Android phone/tablet. I stripped it to essentials so it’s dead simple and reliable.

Here are the real-world use cases from small operators who’ve tested it (based on feedback loops I’ve run):

1.  Lightning-Fast Order Taking During Rush Hours

Customer wants a burger + fries + drink? Tap items from your customizable menu, add quantities, apply quick discounts if needed. Total updates instantly—no paper pads, no calculator fumbling. A food truck owner said it cut order time from 45 seconds to under 10, letting them serve more people before the lunch rush dies.

2.  Instant Bill Generation & WhatsApp/Text Sharing (Printer Optional)

Generate a clean receipt with items, totals, taxes, and your business name. One tap shares it as plain text or image via WhatsApp, email, or SMS. Customers pay cash, card, or digital—mark it paid in the app. Perfect for places without printers; reduces “wait, what was the total again?” confusion and builds a professional vibe.

3.  Smart Inventory Alerts to Prevent Running Out

Track stock levels (e.g., coffee beans, ingredients). As you sell, it deducts automatically. Set low-stock thresholds → get red alerts when you’re about to run dry. One cafe owner uses this to reorder supplies just in time, avoiding “sorry, sold out” lost sales during peak times.

4.  Customer Notes for Repeat Visitors & Loyalty

Save quick profiles (name/number + preferences like “extra cheese” or “decaf only”). Pull them up next time they come in for personalized service. Small shops report this turns one-timers into regulars who tip better and spread word-of-mouth.

5.  End-of-Day Reports That Actually Help

View daily/weekly/monthly sales, top-selling items, cash flow, and basic profit estimates (after entering expenses). No spreadsheets—just open the app. A food truck operator uses the “most popular items” list to tweak menus and boost revenue by 15-20% without guessing.

6.  True Offline Reliability Anywhere

No internet? No problem. Works in remote spots, during outages, or on the go. Data saved locally; easy manual backups to your phone or Drive if you want. Ideal for markets, events, or areas with spotty connections.

7.  Built for Solo Operators or Tiny Teams

One device, no accounts/logins, no complexity. Handles everything from open to close without overwhelming you.

It’s still early-stage (low downloads so far), but feedback is strong: “Finally, something free that doesn’t suck.” If you’re a small food business owner tired of overpriced tools, give it a spin and tell me what’s missing—I’m iterating based on real input.

1qsszc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Either-Ad9985/comments/1qsszc9/that_stupid_green_turtle/,That stupid Green Turtle,"For weeks. I’ve been seeing AI videos of a story about a female boss, and a Green Turtle Plush. As much as I despised the AI slop videos? I can’t say it didn’t pique my interest. I’ve seen tens of hundreds of videos and it tormented me. But no longer. I found it. Its titles The Cuck Turtle Fatal Connection. But you can’t find it easily.

You can find it by going to Macaron AI and texting the AI bot, 497259. That code. You need to sign in with your Google account.

What? Too sketchy? I FULLY AGREE. Hence why I used a fake Google account. See I have upwards of 10 false accounts I use. I’m safe, untraceable. But I know many are curious to find the story. 

You don’t have to risk your safety. I’ve gone ahead and done that for you. So guess what? Here it is…

The Cuck Turtle Fatal Connection:

Chapter 1:

To humiliate me, my female boss gifted me a green turtle plushie. I gave the toy's belly a gentle pinch, only to watch her expression change instantly as she clutched her own stomach. Back home, I found the plushie felt quite nice to the touch, so I kept stroking it.

But in the dead of night, my boss called me.

""Stop touching it, please? How about... I just come over to your place instead?""

My name is Jack. I've been grinding at this marketing firm in Chicago for five years, but my boss, Veronica, has been trying to bury me since day one. She wants me out, dead or alive. The beef? Simple. Five years ago, I walked into the interview room and destroyed her boyfriend. I got the job; he got the boot. Correction: Ex-boyfriend. They broke up shortly after, but Veronica never let it go. She blamed me for ruining her “perfect future."" So, she climbed the corporate ladder with a vengeance, clawing her way up to VP just so she could look down on me. I didn't slack off, though. I'm right below her.

Close enough to be a thorn in her side, but performing too well for her to fire without a lawsuit.

“Jack. I got you a little something.""

Veronica dropped a plush toy onto my desk with a heavy thud. It was a turtle. A bright, neon green turtle with a stupid grin. But she had taken a sharpie and written ""CUCK"" in big black letters across its shell.

“What's this supposed to be, Veronica?"" I asked, leaning back in my chair.

“Just a reminder of your place,"" she smirked, her red lips curving into a cruel smile. ""Heard about your girlfriend. Or should I say, ex-girlfriend? Cheating on you with a finance bro? Ouch. This turtle is slow and pathetic. Just like you.""

The office went silent. Whispers rippled through the cubicles. “That's cold, even for her,"" someone muttered. My jaw tightened. Two days ago, I found out my girlfriend was banging some guy from Wall Street. I was raw. I was angry. And Veronica knew exactly where to stick the knife.

“Cute,"" I said, my voice low. ""Thanks for the concern, Veronica. I'll be sure to return the favor.""

I grabbed the turtle by its neck. I didn't explode. I didn't scream. I knew she was baiting me. One HR violation, one outburst, and she'd have the ammo to fire me. Five years of psychological warfare, and she was still waiting for me to slip.

“Heh. I'll be waiting,"" she whispered, spinning on her heels and walking away.

Chapter 2: The Connection

I took the damn turtle home.

I threw it on my couch. It was an insult, sure, but it fueled me. It was like bitter medicine-it woke me up. I stared at the green fabric, swearing to myself that I'd never be a simp again. No more getting played.

I picked up the turtle, intending to toss it in the trash, but my thumb brushed against the fabric of its shell. I paused. I ran my hand over the bottom of the shell, near the tail.

“What the hell?"" It felt... weirdly good. Not like cheap polyester. It felt warm. I rubbed it again. The texture wasn't fabric. It felt like skin. Soft, yielding, elastic skin.

“This is insane,"" I muttered. ""It's a five-dollar gag gift. Why does the ass feel so realistic?

“I pressed my fingers deeper. It had resistance. It had warmth. It felt exactly like squeezing a woman's ass.

“No way."" I shifted my grip and rubbed the turtle's stomach. Soft. velvety. But different from the back. It felt like a flat, toned stomach. It felt terrifyingly familiar. I closed my eyes and rubbed the lower belly of the toy. A shiver ran down my spine. It felt exactly like touching my ex-girlfriend. No, better. Smoother. Tighter.

""Is this some kind of new silicone tech?"" I wondered aloud. ""Did she spend a fortune on a high-tech sex doll just to mock me?""

I was lonely, drunk on whiskey, and angry. So, I didn't stop. I spent the night mindlessly stroking the plushie, trying to numb the pain of the breakup. I fell asleep cuddling the damn thing, my hand resting on its soft underbelly. It was the best sleep I'd had in weeks. It felt like there was a real woman in bed with me.

The next morning at the office, Veronica looked like a train wreck.

“Ms. Veronica, are you okay?"" an intern asked. “You look exhausted.""

Veronica had dark circles under her eyes. She looked like she hadn't slept a wink. She was jittery, on edge.

“I'm fine,"" she snapped, storming into her office.

""What's her problem?"" I whispered to myself. “Needs to get laid, probably.""

She slammed her door shut. I smirked and went back to work.

Chapter 3: The Phantom Touch

Around lunch, I walked past the break room. The door was slightly ajar. I heard whimpering.

""Stop... please...""

""God, stop touching me...""

""I don't know who you are... just stop...""

The voice was breathless, desperate. It was Veronica.

My eyebrows shot up. Was she hooking up in the break room? At noon? I knew she was frustrated, but this was bold.

I peeked through the crack in the door. Veronica was alone. She was lying on the leather sofa, her body twisting, her hands clutching her own waist and thighs. She was asleep, but she was reacting to something.

""She's dreaming about getting felt up?"" I thought, amused. ""Man, that dry spell must be hitting her hard.""

I pulled out my phone and recorded a few seconds of the audio. Just in case.

That night, the office group chat (the one without Veronica) was blowing up.

Coworker 1: ""Did you hear Veronica in the break room? Sounded like she was having a nightmare about being groped.""

Coworker 2: ""She's losing it. She kept complaining that someone was touching her all night.""

Coworker 3: ""She needs a boyfriend. Badly.""

I chuckled, reading the texts in bed. I grabbed the Green Turtle, placed it on my lap, and started absentmindedly scratching its back while watching Netflix.

Midnight struck. My phone rang.

Caller ID: The Bitch (Veronica)

I answered. ""Veronica? It's late.""

“Jack!"" Her voice was shrill, trembling with rage. ""Is it you? Are you doing this?""

""Doing what? I'm in bed, watching TV. You crazy?""

""Don't play dumb! I know it's you! Someone is touching me! Everywhere! Is this some kind of voodoo?""

""You're hallucinating, Veronica. Go see a doctor. Or get a date.""

I was annoyed. She wakes me up to accuse me of ghost-groping her?

Out of spite, I grabbed the turtle's ass and squeezed it. Hard. A pinch.

“AHHH!"" Veronica screamed on the other end of the line. ""My ass! You just pinched my ass!""

I froze. I looked at the turtle. I looked at my hand.

“Wait..."" I gently ran a finger down the turtle's stomach.

""Mmm..."" A soft, involuntary moan escaped Veronica's lips through the speaker.

Holy shit. It wasn't a hallucination. The doll... it was linked to her. Sensory synchronization.

""Jack….."" she gasped. ""If that's you... stop.""

A wicked grin spread across my face. She gave me this doll to humiliate me. She wanted me to look at it and feel like a loser. But instead, she handed me the remote control to her body.

“So what if it is me?"" I whispered into the phone, my voice dropping an octave. ""I'm just playing with my toy, Veronica. The one you gave me.""

I dragged my nails lightly across the turtle's chest.

“Oh god..."" she whimpered.

“If you want me to stop,"" I said coldly, ""you know where I live. Come beg.""

I hung up.

Chapter 4: The Midnight Deal

I sat there, staring at the neon green turtle. This was power. Absolute, terrifying power. I poked its belly button. Nothing happened. I squeezed the thigh. I waited.

Twenty minutes later, there was a frantic pounding on my apartment door.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

""Jack! Open up!""

I checked the time. 3:00 AM. I shoved the turtle under my bed, threw on a t-shirt, and opened the door.

Veronica stood there. She was a mess. Her hair was disheveled, she was wearing a trench coat over pajamas, and her eyes were wild.

“You sick bastard,"" she hissed, pushing past me into the apartment.

“Whoa, easy. You're trespassing,"" I said, leaning against the doorframe.

She spun around, tears welling in her eyes. The ice queen was melting.

""Please,"" she whispered, her voice cracking. ""Just stop. I can't take it anymore. It feels like... it feels like you're everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't think.""

“I don't know what you're talking about,"" I lied smoothly.

She stared at me, then took a deep breath. Her hands went to the belt of her trench coat.

“If you think I'm lying... if you think this is a game...""

She let the coat drop. Underneath, she was wearing a sheer silk nightgown. Her body was incredible-toned, curvy, mature. She reached into her pocket and threw a foil wrapper on the table. A condom.

“I'll give it to you,"" she said, her face burning red with humiliation. ""Real. In the flesh. Just... stop using that thing.""

I looked at the condom, then at her.

""You're trying to set me up,"" I said. ""I touch you, and tomorrow I'm in jail for assault. Nice try, Veronica.""

“I'm not!"" she cried out. ""I just want to sleep! I'll do anything. I'll sign whatever you want!""

She was desperate. The sensory overload from the doll must be torture for her.

“Anything?""

""Yes!""

I grabbed a notepad and a pen. I scribbled a quick, legally binding consent form. 'I, Veronica \[Last Name\], am here of my own free will, initiating sexual contact with Jack \[Last Name\]. I consent to all acts...'

""Sign it,"" I commanded.

She didn't hesitate. She signed it with a shaking hand. I took a photo of the note and uploaded it to my cloud. Then, I tossed the condom she brought into the trash.

""Hey!"" she protested.

""I don't use cheap brands,"" I said, opening my drawer and pulling out a premium one. ""And don't worry. I'm not the monster you think I am. But since you're offering...""

I walked up to her. The tension in the room was thick enough to choke on.

“Bedroom. Now.""

She bit her lip, lowered her head, and followed me.

Chapter 5: The Addiction

The next morning, sunlight hit my face. Veronica was sitting on the edge of the bed, buttoning her shirt. She looked different. The dark circles were gone. Her skin was glowing.

""It stopped,"" she murmured, not looking at me. “After we... started. The phantom touching stopped. I actually slept.""

""Glad I could help,"" I said, stretching.

She turned to look at me. Her eyes were complex-confusion, shame, and a hint of lingering lust.

""This never happened,"" she said, her voice trying to regain its icy edge. ""At work, we are strangers.""

""Sure,"" I shrugged. ""But you might want to borrow a shirt. Yours is ripped.""

I tossed her one of my ex's old oversized hoodies. She put it on, sniffing it disdainfully, and practically ran out of the apartment.

I pulled the Green Turtle out from under the bed.

""How does this work?"" I wondered.

I decided to test it. I gave the turtle a little pat on the head. Nothing. I put it back in the closet.

At work, the atmosphere was weird. Veronica wasn't screaming. She wasn't glaring. She was... calm.

""Jack, can I see you in my office?"" she called out over the intercom.

I walked in. She closed the blinds.

""Lunch,"" she said. ""With me.""

""Is that an order?""

""Yes.""

We went to a quiet bistro. She ordered a glass of wine.

""I haven't felt this peaceful in five years,"" she admitted, swirling the red liquid. ""Jack, what did you do to me?""

""I told you, I'm just good at my job,"" I grinned.

She stared at me intensely.

""I want to move in.""

I choked on my water. ""Excuse me?""

“I'm serious. The only time the sensation stops is when I'm with you. When I'm physically with you. It neutralizes the... whatever that link is.""

""You want to live with me? You hate me.""

""I did,"" she said softly. ""But women are emotional creatures, Jack. We follow our feelings. And right now? My feelings are telling me that I need you to function.""

She leaned across the table, her hand brushing mine. ""I'll pay half the rent. I'll cook. I'll... take care of your needs. Every night.""

It was a tempting offer. My enemy, the VP, becoming my live-in sex slave just to stop the haunting sensations of a plush toy?

""One month,"" I said. ""And you sign a cohabitation agreement. No false accusations.""

""Deal.""

Chapter 6: The Toxic Honeymoon

The rumors at the office started swirling immediately.

""Are Jack and Veronica... a thing?""

""I saw them driving in together. She wasn't even yelling at him.""

""Dude, I heard they're living together.""

They weren't wrong. For the past two weeks, my life had turned into a bizarre, twisted sitcom. We were enemies by day, but at night? At night, we were animals. It was a transaction. Pure and simple. Veronica needed my body next to hers to ground her neural pathways-or whatever the hell was happening with that doll-and I... well, I was enjoying the perks of sleeping with the boss.

She cooked. She cleaned. She was surprisingly domestic for a woman who used to threaten to fire me for breathing too loud.

""Jack, eat your steak,"" she said one evening, sliding a plate across the table. Her eyes were soft, almost loving. ""I made it rare, just how you like it.""

""You're spoiling me, Ronnie,"" I teased, cutting into the meat.

""Don't get used to it,"" she murmured, watching me eat with an intensity that made the hair on my arms stand up. ""I'm just protecting my investment.""

We fell into a rhythm. We'd drive to work, pretend to be professional, come home, tear each other's clothes off, eat dinner, and sleep.

It was perfect.

Too perfect.

Chapter 7: Red Flags

It started on a Tuesday morning. I was brushing my teeth, staring at my reflection. I looked tired. Paler than usual.

I spit into the sink.

Red.

A bright crimson swirl mixed with the toothpaste foam.

""What the..."" I coughed, and a splatter of blood hit the mirror.

I'm twenty-eight. I go to the gym. I eat clean. I don't cough up blood.

Panic set in. I rinsed my mouth, but the metallic taste lingered. My stomach had been cramping for days, but I chalked it up to stress or the rich food Veronica had been cooking.

I called in sick. Veronica was already at the office.

""I'm not feeling well,"" I told her over the phone.

""Oh no,"" her voice dripped with concern. ""Do you want me to come home? I can make you some soup.""

""No,"" I said, a cold realization washing over me. ""I'm just going to rest.""

I hung up and drove straight to the ER.

Chapter 8: The Diagnosis

""Arsenic,"" the doctor said, looking at my chart with a frown. ""And traces of thallium.""

""Excuse me?""

""You're being poisoned, son. It's a low dose, cumulative. Someone has been feeding this to you over a period of weeks. If you hadn't come in today, your organs would have started shutting down by the weekend.""

The room spun.

I made it rare, just how you like it. Drink this tea, it helps with sleep.

I'm just protecting my investment.

Veronica.

She wasn't addicted to me. She wasn't falling for me. She was fattening the pig before the slaughter. She moved in not to sleep with me, but to make sure I ate every single poisoned bite.

I didn't go home. I went to the police station. I gave them samples of the water bottle she packed for me and the leftovers in my fridge. Then, I went to my car and pulled the Green Turtle out of the trunk.

Chapter 9: Voodoo Interrogation

I sat in the hospital parking lot, staring at the neon green plushie.

I dialed Veronica's number.

""Jack? How are you feeling?"" She sounded so sweet. So innocent.

""I'm at the hospital, Veronica.""

""Oh my god! Is it serious? I'm coming right now.""

""Don't bother,"" I said, my voice ice cold. ""The doctor says I'm poisoned.""

Silence on the other end.

""Poisoned?"" she repeated, her voice trembling slightly. ""Like….. food poisoning?""

""No. Like arsenic. Like murder.""

""Jack, that's... that's crazy. Who would do that?""

""I don't know,"" I whispered. ""But I'm really frustrated right now. I need to punch something.""

I pulled back my fist and smashed it into the turtle's stomach.

""Gah!""

Veronica gasped on the phone. The sound was wet, painful.

""What was that, Veronica? You okay?""

""I... I just stubbed my toe,"" she lied, her breath hitching.

Wham.

I punched the turtle again, right in the chest.

""Stop!"" she screamed. ""Jack, stop it!""

""Stop what? I'm just playing with my doll. The one you gave me.""

I grabbed the turtle by the throat and squeezed.

""I know it's you,"" I snarled. ""I know about the poison. And I know you can feel this.""

""Please..."" she choked out. ""I can't breathe...""

""Tell me why! Five years, Veronica! You tried to kill me over a job?""

""Come home,"" she wheezed. ""I'll tell you everything. Just... let go of the doll.""

Chapter 10: The Science of Hate

I didn't go home. I met her at a neutral location—a coffee shop near the precinct. I had the turtle in a bag on the table. My hand was inside the bag, resting on its neck.

She looked pale. She was clutching her stomach.

""It's not magic,"" she said, her voice hollow.

""Explain.""

""Neural Link technology. Our company's secret R&D division. I volunteered as a test subject. The sensors in the doll are quantum-entangled with the chip in my cortex. It transmits tactile data directly to my sensory nerves.""

""You turned yourself into a human voodoo doll?""

""I wanted to drive you crazy,"" she hissed, her eyes flashing with that old hatred. ""I wanted you to touch it, to feel powerful, and then I was going to use the link to manipulate you. But then... you moved in.""

""And you decided to kill me instead.""

""I couldn't help it!"" she snapped. ""Every time you touched me, I felt weak. I hated needing you. I hated that my body responded to you. The only way to be free was to get rid of you. Permanently.""

She looked at me, tears streaming down her face. Not tears of remorse, but tears of frustration.

""I almost had it,"" she whispered. ""Another week. You would have died of 'natural causes.' Heart failure.""

""You're a psychopath.""

“I'm ambitious, Jack. There's a difference.""

Two police officers walked into the coffee shop. I had signaled them earlier.

Veronica didn't run. She just stared at me with pure venom.

""I hope you rot,"" she spat as they cuffed her.

Chapter 11: The Twist

Veronica was charged with attempted murder. The evidence was overwhelming. The poisoned food, the lab results, the unauthorized use of experimental tech.

She went away. I went back to work.

I got her job. Finally, I was the VP.

I kept the Green Turtle. I cut it open and ripped out the sensors, smashing them with a hammer until they were dust. I wasn't taking any chances.

Life went back to normal. I dated a few girls, but nothing stuck. It's hard to trust anyone when your last girlfriend tried to feed you arsenic lasagna.

Three months later, I got a letter from the state penitentiary.

No return address. Just a folded piece of paper inside.

It was a sonogram.

A grainy, black-and-white image of a fetus.

And a note, written in Veronica's elegant, sharp handwriting:

""You can destroy the doll, Jack. But you can't destroy the link. We're connected forever now. See you in nine months, Daddy.""

I stared at the photo. My blood ran cold.

The ""protection"" I used that first night... the one she brought? I threw it away. But the nights after that? The nights we were ""addicted"" to each other?

We got sloppy.

I dropped the letter. I could feel a phantom sensation-a cold hand gripping my heart.

She won. Even from a jail cell, she won.

But I don't know what to do.,"I've (22) been cargiving for my parents since I was a young child. When I was about 6-7 it was mostly easier stuff like helping them in and out of bed and moving mobility aids in and out of the car and such. 

As they aged they've gotten a lot worse. All and any other support they had has either died or they've pushed them away. I cook, clean, pay the bills, take care of the pets, do the laundry, almost everything. 

My parent's have a lot of issues. Polio, Diabetes, hip replacements, etc. I now also care for my grandmother with alzheimers, so I do fulltime caregiving for three disabled adults. My grandma used to have retirement savings, she worked very hard all of her life, but my dad stole and gambled it all. We're in massive amounts of debt that they wont even tell me the extent of. I have to balance my college loans between actually paying for college, keeping our utilities on, and medical supplies. 

I have medical issues myself, so I can't work on top of full time college classes and caregiving. Even if I could I wouldn't have the time. My parent's have aged out of disability care in canada now. 

Multiple falls a week, sometimes multiple a day, has paramedics at my house very often. They always refuse to go to a hospital AMA. 

Today, my mom fell in the washroom, and tried to get me to wipe her before she would let me call for someone to help her get up. Now, I've cleaned every body fluid you can imagine up from our floor, beds, walls, etc. I am not paid to wipe butts and I will not do it. I clean up trash and mold and bugs and everything all the time. 

We used to have another older adult here with dementia but she passed a few years ago. I would help change her diapers and everything even though I was only 16. 

Recently, my mom was in the hospital for 5 weeks, and I haven't gotten that much college work done in years. Usually, they call me and wake me up at any time of day or night, for any reason. Even just to get them a coffee. I used to attend highschool with maybe 3-4 hours of sleep a day. 

Ever since I was about 9 or 10, my mom has had episodes of throwing things and hitting me and yelling and stuff. My dad says that I need to be patient with her because shes really unwell, and I know she is. But I ended up being diagnosed with ptsd from everything. She sometimes suggests that I pay men who help us by ""giving them a show"". I don't do that. She touches me sometimes in ways that I don't like and has been for a long time.

Now I'm at a point where i'm fully running out of money. I had to try and ration my own medication recently to be able to pay off a bill. She just got home this week from the hospital and she's fallen three times. Two of which resulted in bodily fluids going everywhere. 

I don't know if I can do this anymore. I've never lived on my own since I've been cargiving for them my whole life, and I don't even know if I could/how to, but Idk what to do. I feel so stuck. I don't even have enough money in my bank account to cover the (frankly ridiculous) monthly rent of an apartment. I don't know if id be able to work right away.

Even if I left right now and never came back, who would take care of them? Do you get in trouble for ""abandoning"" someone who technically needs a caregiver? ",2,1769934483.0,CaregiverSupport,4,1.0,False

I’m looking to connect with a female friend — open to virtual chats first and, if we click, meeting in person for coffee, drinks, or a relaxed dinner.

Easygoing, respectful, and enjoy good conversation, good food, and exploring new places.

Drinks or dinner are on me 🍷

If this sounds nice, feel free to DM me. Looking forward to connecting 🙂",1,1769934202.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

Sorry if this is incredibly niche

I'm moving up to Auckland in a few days and was wondering what the specialty coffee scene is like? My usual play is to visit a Cafe, try a long black, make convo with the barista if it's quiet, then grab a bag of beans to enjoy at home.

I'm from Wellington and studied in Christchurch, so I've been fortunate enough to have plenty of specialty roasters nearby (House of Good Fortune, laffare, supreme, Havana, Crafted, C1, Hummingbird, etc).

What are the must visit roasters in Auckland?
I think visiting cafes are an excellent way of exploring the city and would love some recommendations.",3,1769934173.0,auckland,34,0.6,False

1qsst5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1qsst5q/been_obsessed_with_content_for_9_months_and/,Been obsessed with content for 9 months and finally figured it out,"The last eight months have honestly been kind of a blur. I got ridiculously into this content creation thing... checking performance before even making coffee, spending lunch breaks dissecting what made videos work, and lying awake replaying the ones that flopped trying to figure out why. It pretty much took over my life.

Why though? Because I actually believed that cracking this would unlock everything. Building something real, getting opportunities, maybe turning this into more than just posting for nobody. It all hinges on whether people actually stop scrolling when they see your video.

Here is what almost made me walk away completely. I was posting every day, testing everything everyone said to try, and getting absolutely nowhere. I would pour effort into something and watch it die at 500 views. I did what the successful people recommended and bought their programs... I switched up my approach constantly, but none of it moved the needle. At some point I genuinely thought maybe I am just not built for this.

That is when I realized the real problem. I was putting in the work but had absolutely no idea what was actually broken. Just throwing spaghetti at the wall hoping something would stick.

So I stopped throwing and started measuring. I pulled up 50 videos, tracked the exact second people clicked away on each one, and kept seeing the same issues killing everything.

1. Being vague in your opening gets you skipped instantly. I was starting with stuff like ""wait till you hear this"" thinking the mystery would hook people. Total opposite. ""I stopped drinking coffee for 65 days and my productivity dropped 40%"" actually stops the scroll.

2. Second 8 or 9 is the real make or break moment. People are not usually leaving right at the start. They leave around second 8 if you still have not given them anything real. Now the payoff hits by second 8 and that is where they really decide.

3. Silence over like 1.3 seconds makes them think it is broken. I tested this constantly and anything longer than maybe 1.3 seconds reads like the video stopped or got boring. I cut way more aggressively now even when it feels choppy.

4. If nothing is changing visually for over 5 seconds they are gone. Doesn't matter if what you are saying is interesting. If the frame stays exactly the same for more than 5 seconds people get bored and scroll.

5. The videos people watch twice get exponentially more reach. Videos where like 27% of viewers watched it again got pushed probably 10 times harder than ones where only 8% rewatched.

The real turning point was finally knowing exactly what was not working instead of just taking shots in the dark. I found this app called Tik'Alyzer that tells you exactly what is wrong with your videos and how to fix them to get more views. Like it will show you second 9 and say ""people dropped here because you paused too long"" or ""your visual stayed static for 8 seconds"". Regular analytics just show percentages but this shows you what you actually need to fix.

That is when everything changed. Went from averaging 500 views to consistently hitting over 21k in about four weeks. If you are posting all the time but stuck under 1k views, I doubt your content is the problem. You probably just can't see what is actually broken.",0,1769933951.0,InstagramMarketing,6,0.33,False
