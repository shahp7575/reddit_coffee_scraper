My wife and I swung by there for lunch. It a new ""casual"" spot with a lot of seating both inside and out. The line was out the door and onto the sidewalk, so we just went to Steady State next door for coffee. BTW - Steady State has had a major glow-up since I'd been there last. Completely remodeled and expanded. It's much nicer than it used to be.

Anyway, the woman at the counter @ SS said the line at Wildland moves pretty fast, so after our coffee, we wandered over. We decided to tough it out and ended up waiting on line for maybe 10 minutes total. We got a selection of things and it all was excellent. Large bowl of chicken soup (not chicken noodle), roast beef sandwich, roasted 1/4 chicken plate, and the pistachio tiramisu. My favorite was the chicken plate as it came with pickled veggies, a mini salad, hummus, and a big slice of focaccia. There were also a couple of dipping sauces: A tasteless chili oil (nothing but heat) and an amazing garlic toum that I'm going to dream about tonight.

During breakfast and lunch, you order at the counter and the bring the food out as it is prepared (this means tiramisu first!). We watched as other folk's food was paraded by and everything looked good, especially the pizzas. They also have a decent pastry selection. Service was good - there are a lot of employees running food and clearing tables. There is also a full bar. 

It's not cheap, especially for counter food - our stuff, along with two iced teas, came to $80. We could have easily skipped the dessert and sandwich, for around $50. Note: this is high-end, full-service-quality food in a casual setting, from the same folks who brought us Jeune et Jolie and Campfire. Knowing that, it almost feels like a bargain. We will definitely return to sample other menu items.",1,1737871486.0,FoodSanDiego,1,1.0,False

1ia7c22,https://youtu.be/HWfzrGbRqp8?si=-nexLukFhkhIwyf7,Munchausen by Internet: the online symptoms of MBP,"
I recently watched this particular YouTube program that was a recorded symposium about a mother who had  Factitious Disorder to Another, or Munchhausen by proxy. (I’m posting the link here ). 

The physicians and staff at a particular hospital was conclusively able to determine that this woman was medically abusing her child, by using social media platforms. One of the methods that they employed to determine this particular mother’s diagnose of Factitious Disorder to another (or MBP) was by perusing her social media posts on Facebook and Instagram, as well as from an online blog that she wrote on Caring Bridge. All of her social media accounts chronicled her sick child’s experiences in great depth, and also justified her requests for financial assistance from family, friends and strangers. 

It became  increasingly obvious to the hospital staff that this mother was assigning her child obscure diagnoses that were inconsistent with her symptoms. The mother also told people that her child was suffering from illnesses that doctors had never actually diagnosed.  

In addition to her bogus allegations, the mother was  soliciting money, while posting many inappropriate pictures of her child. The child was usually pictured in hospital settings, and seen being poked and prodded, or hooked up to machines. These images were considered to be gross violations of the child’s privacy and yet the parent recklessly shared them anyway. 

The medical staff treating the child became increasingly concerned, and decided that the mother’s behavior was indeed an anomaly and that the situation required a closer investigation. After going through the mother’s social media accounts, it was eventually determined that she was definitively suffering from the psychological condition known as Factitious  Disorder to Another, and her child was subsequently removed from her care. Her Facebook posts and her online blog were acknowledged as being consistent with several known symptoms of Factitious Disorder to Another, or Munchhausen by proxy. 

Since 95% of caregivers with children who suffer from this disorder happen to be mothers rather than fathers, I’m substituting the word “mom” for “caregivers”  when discussing the corresponding features of this oft overlooked problem.  The following examples are recurring symptoms of MBP  that routinely crop up on such mothers’ social media pages, and they are common signs of medical abuse. 

Moms who frequently post about their children’s illnesses on Facebook or other platforms are often known to overshare information that is frequently inconsistent with the doctor’s diagnosis, if they happen to have been diagnosed by a physician in the first place.  That’s because often the child’s condition has been initially diagnosed by the parent, who then later attempts to talk doctors into agreeing with their assessment. 

 SW was prone to this behavior. She persistently asserted that Bella and Cece were sick with illnesses and conditions that seemed to be exaggerated, fabricated and consistently inconsistent. 

For example, SW emphasized that both girls had a rare illnesses called Familial Mediterranean Fever that required invasive treatment, like routinely taking their temperatures by using a rectal thermometer several times a day. However, their symptoms of FMF were mysteriously never visible when they were being examined by their pediatrician. 

SW scoured online groups to chat with other parents whose children actually suffered from FMF to ask them about the symptoms. She invariably convinced herself that Bella and Cece had this strange disease too. However, she couldn’t ever get any of the girls’ pediatricians to sign off on Bella and Cece having FMF,  so she moved on to other illnesses for them that she could obtain positive diagnoses for. 

Eventually she focused on severe cases of asthma and allergies, clogged tear ducts, undersized esophagus, or chronic headaches and ear infections that she insisted that they had. She would triumphantly announce their afflictions in an endless stream of online posts, generally including medicines that were prescribed to them too. Of course, they both needed to take daily medications, and she advertised this so much that everyone who knew her was also  painfully aware of it. 

SW would also report that Bella and Cece were suffering from maladies that would disappear overnight. One day SW would report that Bella had pneumonia, but the very next day she would be photographed happily playing outside, with no further explanation. 

In another instance, SW complained that she had been up all night, caring for Cece’s ear infection, but the next day, Cece was shown happily frolicking about and even jumping into a swimming pool. Her ear infection seemed to have miraculously disappeared! These  weren’t isolated incidents, but rather par for the course in both of her children’s lives. 

Another sign of MBP that can be discerned in social media posts is when moms enthusiastically share posts about their children’s illnesses, while simultaneously being inappropriately unconcerned. Seemingly serious conditions are flippantly treated like minor inconveniences that are no big deal. These moms almost express enthusiasm over diagnoses that would otherwise be considered to be distressful and incredibly upsetting to most parents. 

Not only did SW not seem to be worried, but she usually seemed strangely energized  whenever she’d announce that her kids had been given a severely traumatic diagnosis. She’d include laugh emojis and cutesy hashtags: allergykids, asthmakids, hospitalkids, waitingroomkids, twosickkiddos, sisterswhoshareeverything! 

She’d post pictures of them looking pale and pained, whereas she’d be beaming as she posed herself holding them in her arms. 

In contrast, most people who are dealing with their own sick children, can’t mask their worried emotions. They also don’t feel compelled to show their children off when they’re feeling terrible or when they’re injured. 

This was hardly the case with SW, who would remain smiling and cheerful, whilst  presenting pictures of Bella and Cece, appearing to be miserably suffering. SW’s hair would be perfect, her nails were always done and she looked like she was wholly self satisfied, no matter how badly her children were compromised.

Another indication of MBP in social media posts is evident when moms constantly emphasize the sacrifices that they’ve been required to make for their sick kids. They’ll  present themselves as selfless mothers who stay up all night caring for their babies. They drive it home that they are always on top of it and prepared for any difficulties that come with the territory of having an ill or injured child. This became all the more prevalent when it came to SW promoting Thrive, using her sick children as MLM marketing tools. 

SW did this often, as in daily. She never stopped espousing the benefits of Thrive, and specified that it was directly responsible for her boundless energy to get through the tough days and nights with her “sick kiddos”. 

The girls never seemed to get better, but this didn’t affect her own mood. Rather, she remained cheerful and focused, attributing her health and happiness to the “Thrive” adhesive patches that she visibly wore throughout the day. She was always thrilled to be thriving, even though Bella and Cece were not. 

In contrast to her kids, who were almost always sleeping, SW could do several loads of laundry, clean the whole house, and then ship out MLM products, while making long winded videos of herself, boasting that she did 99% more than all other mothers and wives! She did everything while taking care of two sick children, or three whenever she chose to include her husband into the mix. 

Another red flag of MBP that’s commonly represented on social media , are moms who have no sense of what is or isn’t appropriate. They have no filter when it comes to posting pictures of their children in various states of undress, or whenever they were using the bathroom or taking showers. They tend to showcase their children in situations that are unflattering or even gross, and this was something that SW indulged in whenever an opportunity presented itself. 

Bella and Cece were often seen in compromising positions, eating dog food or drinking water from the toilet. She’d photograph them with snot bubbles coming from their noses, and there was even one case of Cece spreading feces on herself and eating it. She featured them playing with feminine hygiene products, sticking maxipads on their heads, or wearing unused tampons on their fingers. They would mimic their own experiences  by taking their stuffed animals temperatures with rectal thermometers, or they’d use implements on their toys that were intended  to treat gas in babies. 

They were constantly shown using the toilet. One post actually showed Bella using her new portable “potty”’in the backseat of SW’s Lexus, but the second shot showed the door halfway closed “because she’d asked for privacy”. 

These posts were supposed to be cute, but the internet is permanent. SW completely ignored what are considered “appropriate boundaries” and this is another symptom of MBP. 

Another indicator that a mom might have MBP  that’s commonly represented on social media networks are Moms who consistently post photos of their children in doctors offices, hospitals and even hospital waiting rooms. They’re prone to post graphic images of their children undergoing compromising medical therapies. This includes multiple  photos taken of children as patients, sleeping in hospital beds, with both pre and post operative pictures. 

MBP moms usually overshare photos of their children undergoing medical treatments and/or surgical procedures, frequently including pictures of their children unclothed or even naked as they undergo various examinations. 

SW was always posting content of her children that reflected this kind of behavior. Whenever they had a doctors appointment, she’d show whatever was being done that day. She showcased them naked on scales, or naked when getting tested for allergies. How many photos did she post of the girls with their nebulizers? Not just one or two pictures like this , but several!  

She always photographed their wounds and posted them with relish and it didn’t matter if they were experiencing discomfort or not. She even bought them matching hospital scrubs for one of their surgeries and showed them wearing them in a hospital room . She bragged that they should receive a frequent flier card for the hospital, and would post countless times about each one of their procedures. This is an established example of a mother who has MBP, and in SW’s case, the shoe fits. 

These same MBP moms often are prone to go overboard when discussing their children’s medical issues. They’ll use medical terminology that is overly verbose and filled with dramatic detail to describe whatever condition their child is experiencing. Again, they do this while remaining upbeat and nonplussed by what would be inherently traumatizing for most parents.

Whenever Bella or Cece had a medical procedure or surgery, SW would describe it with overwhelming precision in one post after another. Nothing was ever too insignificant to share, and every time they vomited was dutifully recorded, replete with the various hours that they’d thrown up, and all for the benefit of her Facebook friends. 

Their medical procedures were expounded upon with painstaking clarity. When Cece had tear duct surgery, SW described it as “an dacryocystorhinostomy, performed by an oculoplastic surgeon”. What about the girls’ bilateral ear tubes and adenoidechtomy? The more medical terminology that she could throw in, the better. Perhaps some people will use jargon like that when conversing with a health care professional, but it’s not really necessary for a Facebook audience. 

Bella and Cece never had common sicknesses either. It was always virulent infections and all encompassing viruses, croup rather than a cough, pneumonitis instead of a cold. Cece didn’t just have “allergies”. She was “anaphylactic” and might die! Their asthma was so bad that SW said that they needed nebulizers nightly. 

But behind the scenes the nebulizers were mostly for photo ops, and when visitors arrived, they never saw the girls using them. The impression that SW gave to everyone was that nothing was ever so tough  that a mother taking Thrive couldn’t handle it thought. She was always taking smiling selfies while tending to two sick kids without even drinking a cup of coffee to get her through the day! Of course the hospital staff were phenomenally impressed with her (or so she said). Her daughters’ illnesses were an extraordinarily convenient way to show off what a superwoman she was! 

Another example of MBP are the moms who create overly dramatic narratives about their children’s illnesses. Life or death experiences are commonplace. 

While SW was visiting her in-laws, Nutgate turned out to be a great opportunity for her to create a huge to do over a situation that was not that big of a deal. Yet how many times did SW pronounce that “Celeste could’ve died!” by directly implicating her grandmother? 

Although she was adept at accusing others of deliberate sabotage, MBP mothers are always focused on their own needs in relation to caring for their children. They are apt to describe the hardships and challenges they face in their role, to make them appear to be attentive, supportive and caring parents. The whole world might be against them, but they’re not going to ever give up! 

Think of the posts that SW made after Nutgate, expounding on her child, who had almost died because of a pistachio, while declaring how fiercely protective she was, like a mama bear, defending her cub! The sacrifices she was willing to make for the girls, somehow took precedence over the children themselves. She was always so dramatic, heavy handed and 100% contrived!  

The mother featured in the symposium discussed in the YouTube video was also constantly posting fundraisers for her child, and this is another example of Factitious Disorder. Although Shannan didn’t habitually promote crowd funding posts to assist with Bella and Cece’s medical bills, Chris’s coworkers expressed that they had all chipped in to purchase gifts for Bella and Cece after one of their surgeries.

Nevertheless, before marrying Chris, SW had been obsessively involved in online fundraising for herself when she was allegedly diagnosed with lupus in 2010. If you look through her older posts, she was constantly collecting money and donations for the Lupus Foundation. Of course, if someone insists that they have a debilitating medical condition, most people are not willing to challenge their claims and they’re happy to donate whatever they can for a good cause. 

Usually when persistent “fundraising” for medical conditions isn’t matched with transparency and accountability, it’s another sign of Factitious Disorder. Whenever money is supposedly going to a charitable cause, yet isn’t formally acknowledged by the entity that it’s being earmarked for, there’s always a chance that the funds might have been misappropriated. 

If everything is on the up and up, ongoing fundraising for medical care is still a stark reminder that an individual illness has been a debilitating strain. After SW and the girls were murdered, didn’t her mother collect funds on SW’s behalf for the Lupus Foundation? Yet the Foundation never formally disclosed how much money was ever donated in SW’s name!  

Although SW hadn’t yet begun to aggressively raise money for her children’s ailments, it might’ve only been a matter time before she began passing around the hat. She was certainly no stranger to that kind of dubious behavior, since it was her former way of doing things.

The mother(in the YouTube video), would frequently entreat her family and friends to donate money to her child’s healthcare with Go Fund Me Accounts and a Caring Bridge site, even though the child’s medical bills were mostly covered by her insurance. It was because of her ample  insurance coverage that medical professionals realized that the money she was receiving was being siphoned into her pocket and then only a matter of time before they were able to confront her with her deception. 

When going over the known signs of mothers with Factitious Disorder to another by specifically looking at their online profiles, it’s fairly obvious that SW exhibited all of the most revealing characteristics of this misunderstood disorder. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck… usually it’s a duck.  She definitely landed on the Munchausen spectrum, undeniably fitting all of the criteria for how MBP is generally manifested in social media interactions. 

It’s also helpful that the medical community has begun to recognize that MBP might be detected by looking at certain parents’ social media history. Hopefully this will make the condition easier to diagnose in the future. 

One pressing  question that has arisen is whether it is okay, or a violation of privacy to use a person’s social media presence to make qualified decisions about their parental behavior and treatment of their offspring. However, the general consensus within the medical community is that anything that is shared to online sites, is no longer private information, regardless of whether the person’s settings are public or not. 

Whenever something seems problematic online in regards to the treatment of minors, it is now considered to be public information that can be used  to make medical diagnoses that may be upheld in a court of law.  Therefore, Facebook posts are legitimately applicable in influencing decisions about whether or not a parent is potentially inflicting medical abuse upon a child. This is a recent advancement that wasn’t the case when Bella and Cece were patients at the various hospitals where  they received their care 

In my opinion, SW could actually serve as a poster child for all of the behaviors that have been identified as being associated with Munchausen by proxy, as seen on social media platforms. This is visibly obvious from going through her personal Facebook account . SW’s Facebook page  is rife with all of the same behaviors that the physicians used to come to their respective conclusions in reference to the mother discussed in the YouTube video. 

Had SW not been the victim of a heinous crime, she could probably be used in medical studies as an example of a parent who fit alll of the criteria for a positive diagnosis of Factitious Disorder to another.  She was doing all of the things that the other mother in question was doing, and she was doing them with impunity. Everyone sung her praises as a great mother, which gave her the positive attention that she craved. Regrettably, her children’s rights were shelved. 

To this day she is seen as having been a wonderfully supportive mother, which is another sign of the disorder. This is in spite of the fact that she was exploiting her kids in plain sight. After reviewing her damning social media posts that chronicled both Bella and Cece’s medical histories, it seems evident that she was medically abusing them, regardless of whether her supporters care to admit this  or not.  

Anyone who sincerely cares about Bella and Cece Watts, shouldn’t naively pretend that they weren’t harmed by the things that their mother did to them in the years leading up to their deaths.  Much could be learned about the signs of Factitious Disorder to Another, and its presence on social media platforms by using SW as an example, but this isn’t likely to ever happen. Her unfortunate, untimely demise  makes this an impossibility . Too many people balk at the notion of using a victim of a brutal crime to foster public awareness of a vastly misunderstood condition, whereas Bella and Cece’s truth has never been as important as their mother’s big lie.

Currently living in Denver (RiNo/Five Points), considering a job offer in Dallas.

If I take the role, I’d want to end up in a neighborhood that’s very walkable, has a lot of options for coffee shops, restaurants, entertainment, etc that I don’t have to drive or walk too far to. 

My understanding having grown up in Texas (Tyler) is that Dallas is a pretty car-centric city and not being able to live in a neighborhood that would allow me to walk around and do things would kind of be a dealbreaker for me… I own a car and would do a lot of driving for work (sales), but I like to live a lifestyle that doesn’t require a car too often when I’m not working. I love walking around Denver and would love to find a way to recreate that lifestyle if I move to Dallas.

Any tips on specific apartment buildings in a walkable neighborhood would be appreciated too! I’m specifically looking for a nice building with an awesome gym and large one-bedroom floorplans. (900+ sqft) below $3500/mo. I’ve been doing a lot of looking and these seem to be pretty hard to find unless I want to pay more in rent than what I’m paying in Denver, which seems backwards?

[FINAL UPDATE],"Me (female 21) and my boyfriend (male 21) are both in the same college and hookup culture here in my country is very intense. Before we got together, we both had people we hooked up with and just now we were having a conversation about it. Nothing too serious, just mentioning that period of time and teasing each other about it. Before him, I had a thing with this one guy in my friend group and we were very close. The thing is, the guy is bissexual and more into guys than girls. This is a very obvious assumption about him and everyone knows, but honestly? I didn’t care, even if people kept talking about it and making fun of the situation. Fast foward to now, my boyfriend mentioned him and made a disgusting look. I assumed it was because of jealousy, because me and this guy were very close and still have the same friend group. I said “You know you don’t have to worry about him, right?” And he started laughing histerically. He responded “Oh, I’m not worried. I’m just thinking how you could have kissed that fag”.
My jaw dropped. I would be lying if I said I didn’t hear stuff like this before, especially coming from my girlfriends, but it was never so blunt e so disrespectful. I was enraged. I got mad at him saying “What is that supposed to mean?” And he tried to change the subject, but I wouldn’t let him. He started asking why I was defending him so much, if I still had feelings for a gay men and said that maybe I shouldn’t see him anymore. The fight just kept getting worse until he left.

I was angry because he was being straight up homophobic and not caring at all about being a good person. This guy, independently if we used to kiss or not, is a huge friend of mine until this day and is actually an amazing person. Him and my boyfriend never fought or anything, everything is usually is very civil. I am immensely in love with my boyfriend and he knows this. This is not about me still liking the other guy. It’s about decency and respect. Am I in the wrong?

So, update.

First of all I'd like to thank the comments that gave me insight when I was in fact, not taking this as seriously as I should. While I don't think I'm the asshole on this particular situation, I agree that I wasn't as harsh on my girlfriends as I should have been. I know it's not an excuse, but these girls are also friends with the guy and the comments never seemed to bother him, he always played it off so I just thought it was not my fight, but since reading your comments, there's no way he's not even a little bothered by it and I can see how much of a hypocrite I have been. Therefore, I will not be taking these comments lightly if they occur again (which i find it hard to believe since we're not seeing each other like that anymore but nevertheless), because I respect my friend and I never think he (or anyone) should be invalidated this way.

About my boyfriend. He texted me two days later saying he wanted to talk. We meet up at our favorite coffee place and he apologized profusely. He said that he had been postponing talking to me about my friend and in that conversation when he finally had the chance, he just blew up. It makes him uncomfortable we see each other so often, given our history, even if it's a group setting. We are in the same classes, extracurricular activities and even parties (again, because of the same friend group). Even though I never gave him any factual points to make him question my love for him, I can see his point because personally, I would hate to see him engage so much with someone he was evolved with. My boyfriend said that he hated what he said, that he's never been this awful before and the jealousy got the best of him. In the end, he said that even though he hates to do this, but he can't take it anymore and I have a choice to make.

Now I'm torn. How am I supposed to choose between one of my best friends from college and my boyfriend? ​

FINAL UPDATE 
So, we broke up. Sorry it took too long for me to finally give you guys an answer. Last time I updated, I had this huge dilemma where I thought I was choosing between two guys I loved, even if it was in different ways. I couldn't be more wrong. I hadn't put a lot of thought into what my boyfriend said in that moment of anger and the more I did it after the more it terrified me. It was so out of character it got me thinking what more unlikely traits of his personality could come out of nowhere. As the days went by, I started to realize I might not know him at all. We met at a Human Rights class, bonded over our projects about female studies, and in the first opportunity of anger (this was our first fight by the way) he threw away everything he believed in and I don't want to be around someone like that, out of principle and out of safety. I'm obviously sad, but I'm actually mourning someone I didn't really know. How terrifying people can become. From now on, I'll make sure to always stand up for my friends and for me.

Yes ‘twas an interesting day. My bf’s(37) asked his mom(65) to leave our home in an angry but comedic way. 
The MIL came to visit to meet our newborn son who is 8 weeks old now. She has been to our home several times and stays with us for no longer than a week at a time as she flys in from another state. Our household is extremely busy, we live with my sister. We have 4 kids, 3 adults and 2 dogs.
Kids are aged 2m-8yrsold. It gets messy sometimes we don’t get to our chores on time. so when she comes to visit she is very needy and particular. Always comments on the state of our house like our laundry is full our sink is gross. 
A little background- She told me once (31)W  if I don’t keep our closets clean she will not buy our children any more clothes.  

She a self proclaimed “paper waster”and needs 2 rolls of toilet paper and napkins on her at all times 
 
Insists on cooking for us then refuses b/c we don’t have a food processor or paper towels. (we said we don’t want her too, she doesn’t have to).  

Refuses to drink coffee unless it’s French vanilla- the delight brand only 

So the most recent visit SET MY BF OFF
 They came home from the airport and bf asks if we all want eggs and bagels my daughter and I said yes MIL says no thank you I have a half of a sandwich in my bag. BF brings us or breakfast and MIL asks where hers is and my Bf said I thought you were going to eat your sandwich and MIL reply’s with I’m allowed to change my mind. So my BF asks would you like me to cook….
MIL interrupts and said no no no no and proceeded to eat a cookie from her bag instead.
 
We apologized for not having her room ready we had the sheets in the dryer still and we used my sisters kids bedroom which they never use and we had to clean up quite a bit for her arrival. We put a fly trap up for fruit flies (there was food in the kids room). Febreezed and vacuumed  also the room left the window open so it not so stuffy. Removed all toys so it’s not so cluttery. I left the room in a condition I would for any guest. I would sleep in there and I think any one I know would too.  

There’s just so much more to this story that I could write but it would be to damn much 
  She wanted to cook meatballs and got upset that we lost the top to the food processor she got us a year ago and my bf would go and buy one right at the very moment she wanted it. She went upstairs and slammed the door and no dinner was cooked. We all ended up taking a nap and woke up hungry so we decided to go out for Chinese buffet. My bf brushed the whole food processor thing off and We got my daughter dressed and asked MIL if she like to join. MIL”oh no no no I would never eat that. I’m staying her. In my bf efforts to spend time together he said ok we can go to cheesecake I know you like it there or any where you’d like to go.  
So me thinking we are all in agreement to go have dinner. I go downstairs to put shoes on and I hear my BF yelling  “I should be able to take a fucking SHIT right here in your room and you should still be happy to be here to visit your grandchildren”. He tells me later that this is when he pulled us pants down and let balls hang out that he should be able to take a SHIT-pants down
 
I went up stairs and asked what happened and my BF said his mom pointed at the pillow we gave her and with a stank face said it’s a dirty disgusting filthy pillow that has TRUMP on the inside of the pillowcase. So stinky she had to wrap her own t-shirt around it. 
We put a clean pillow case on it and hardly use the pillow since it’s small one. 
 Bf.-“Apologize to my gf right now that the only extra pillow we have isn’t good enough”

MIL- “ I’m sorry your pillow is dirty and stinky” “ I’m sorry your boyfriend is” never finishes this sentence. 
Bf yells “you have to leave”
 
MIL”I can’t do this I’m getting a flight.” Books a flight back home for the next day and states it’s gunna cost me an extra 400 dollars. And asks to stay the night and we said yes. 

They kept yelling at eachother. Both insulting eachother. Bringing up old shit and how they wronged eachother in the past.
I’m up and down the stairs checking on my 2 babies then checking on the other 2 asking  them to quit . This goes on for like an hour. She asks if she could have her bags brought up and I said yes I’ll bring them up  in a bit. So I go breastfeed my son and MIL comes down 10 min later asking again while on her phone and no eye contact I need my bag brought up my dog is hungry. I said yes when I’m done feed my son. She could have easily got the little  container of kibble and fed her dog. But I feel like she needs to be waited on hand a foot. By bf does his best and It’s frustrating b/c we have 2. Babies in diapers and have to chase her dog around while it squirts piss on our walls. She is in decent health, able to walk, bend over. She is an able person. 

 I told my bf it was wrong for him to yell at her and he shouldn’t have. As for the kicking her out probably not in the manner that he did it but was it still wrong? 
I’m sharing this b/c I would like to know what would you do in that situation as me or my BF. 

Also are we the are we the assholes? Is the MIL an asshole? Is she being ridiculous? Are we just a bunch of fucking assholes here. I know for sure my bf has an asshole and can be one. But what are your thoughts? Would you deal with that. 
Honestly would have just dealt it b/c she only here for a little while.

Similar “gunk” looking spots were on our paper towel dispenser and a mug in our cabinet. Is this roach-related at all? I’m so paranoid and disgusted that roaches are in everything- esp the coffee maker- and trying to determine what I need or want to replace. Can they leave spots like this?

- Still learning things about myself
- I drink coffee like it's water. 🤤

- are free this afternoon.
- are in or around Katipunan and nearby cities. Also open to meeting halfway if you're a reasonable distance from me.

- Genetically or biologically young (20 ish?) or cuz I really look young, no joke.
- You also believe coffee is good any time of the day.
- A real gym enjoyer is a huge plus!
- Conversational and open to discourse, but not to the point na mema lang. I'm not looking for 200IQ convos but I get bored of a lot of small talk and chismis.

There have been some pretty clear signs of attraction between us the entire time I was in his classes. To be expected and respected, there was 10000% professional conduct on both of our end the entire time. We never once discussed any potential attraction and there were zero meetings outside of class or ANYTHING that could be considered inappropriate or against any rules/laws. There wasn’t a single external indicator of said attraction that would’ve raised any suspicion or anything like that. The attraction I felt came from intense eye contact and some one-on-one conversations that were somewhat flirty and personal (we talked intimately about our personal lives). 
However, now that I have finished school and am out of a crappy long term relationship, I am finding myself contemplating reaching out to him for coffee. I realize because of his position and how it could look, he most likely wouldn’t ever reach out to me in this way. I figure that I will have to be the one to initiate if in fact there was a mutual spark (I could be misreading things, who knows).
Anyways, my question is, should I pull the trigger and email him? I can’t see the harm since I am no longer a student and he has no direct power over me. Please be nice! I know most of you will probably say no - but indulge the romantic me in! ",2,1737870505.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m 25 now. I spent 7 years on this before I sent it out, and this book has grown up with me and become more important to me than I ever expected. It’s about grief, and it has helped me process my own grief. 

I’ve written other books, including one that got me an agent. But this particular book is MY book, you know? 

I’ve since written a sequel. Which is what this post is about. 

So, there’s this song called Obstacles by Syd Matters (if you play Life is Strange…you know the one). This song fits my book super well. I’ve always envisioned it playing at the end scene of the sequel. There’s that song, and then this song called Fisher Island Sound. 

A couple months ago, I was in a coffee shop finishing up the end scenes of the sequel (you know, the scenes that remind me of those songs). I was listening to music, and had the random, silly thought: “If one of those songs played right now, I’d seriously consider it a sign.”

Well, Fisher Island Sound played. Then another song by that same artist. And guess what played next? Obstacles. Out of a 30 hour playlist, those were the songs that played. 

I literally teared up in the coffee shop hahahah. I think it was the impact of realizing, wow, I have an agent. I have a book on submission. I just finished the sequel to a novel I started almost ten years ago, and so much has changed in my life, but it all feels so full circle. 

And the thing about this book is it’s all about signs. Like signs that someone is still with you, or whether they’re just gone. And while I’m a realist, I’ve felt so many signs throughout the process of writing, sharing, and continuing this story. 

Anyway, maybe this is dramatic.

1ia74xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalAudioPlayer/comments/1ia74xj/cant_use_poweramp_need_shuffle_without_repeat/,Can't use PowerAmp; need shuffle without repeat,"Hi y'all.

A while back I asked which after-market music player offered a reliable shuffle-without-repeat-and-then-loop functionality -- which, btw, was a solved problem in 1993 when my Onkyo Carousel CD-Changer could do it without any difficulty at all -- and several members replied with PowerAmp. 

Well it turns out that I cannot use PowerAmp. It's a long story why: Internet connectivity and in-house wifi feature prominently in the story, and it gets us into a whole why-don't-you-just area that will leave me more triggered than John Lithgow watching ICBMs streaking over Kansas. The tl;dr is that I cannot use PowerAmp, or any other aftermarket player that requires ongoing connectivity. My Hiby R4 is \*not\* connected to any source of internet functionality and I would be using a coffee-shop's wifi to install whichever player I choose, and then the Hiby would go back to being never, ever, ever, EVER connected again. 

Pleae, do, \*NOT\* try to talk to me about ""firmware updates."" Neither of us want to get into it; trust me. Please. 

But, that being said, the ask here seems painfully straightforward: A side-loadable music player app that does not require ongoing connectivity, and does reliably offer shuffle-without-repeat-and-then-loop, c.1993. 

All suggestions will be up-voted. Including the ones inviting me to go bleep myself. In fact I'll up-vote those first because they'll be the ones that I'm most likely to agree with and find helpful.

There's a lot of examples because I want to give enough context, also a bit of a vent session. Just know this isn't everything. For background, I've known my friend/roommate since we were in middle school. We're now in our late 20's and have technically lived together for almost 4 years. She considers us best friends but I do not (this is important). She also has diagnosed but untreated ADHD (possibly important, also she has declined treatment). She has had a traveling job for the past 1.5 years and only comes back every few months for a few days at a time. When she lived here full time, on the rare occasion I brought up grievances she would get incredibly defensive. I don't like conflict so I have always just been angry and annoyed and never said anything except for those rare times, and it always ended with us in a yelling match and her aggressively doing the things I asked her to do. It was typically her helping to clean the house and taking care of her dog (because I WFH, she said it ""makes more sense"" for me to be the one doing all the cleaning). She's currently only visiting every once in a while, but will be moving back in  soon. I need to know if this is normal ""friend"" behavior and I should just accept that or if this is leaning towards very unhealthy. If things keep going the way they are, I don't think things will last long after she moves back in because I can't really take it anymore.

There's normal roommate things  - using up all of something and leaving it for me to refill or throw away, telling me that I'm the one that used it up in the first place. Then leaving (literal) chunks of her hair all over the tub and clogging the drain, to the point where I'm cleaning it out multiple times when she's here. She sheds a lot and I rarely wash my hair, so I know it isn't mine, but she says it's ours or lies and says she's cleaned it when she hasn't. She always volunteers me to drive her and her friends around for free but has given attitude the rare times I asked her to return the favor, insisting I need to buy her food or she won't take us there (which ends up totaling what a Lyft costs anyway). She sometimes asks me to do things to ""help"" her but then I always end up doing the majority of the work, yet when I ask her to do something she flat out ignores me (ex. I asked for help installing curtains in the dining room and she left and sat the living room, but she keeps stating that she can't install her bedroom ones unless I help her. She also wants a lightbulb replaced but she has repeatedly said that ""we"" need to do it). Her laptop also broke over the summer. She was told to bring it in to the store to get it fixed but she decided against it every time she was here. She recently acknowledged that she should have done it, but told me ""I'll just have you do it.""

The thing that probably bothers me the most is when she leaves to head back to her traveling job. I have to clean up after her. She leaves the hair and the items to refill/throw away, but then she sometimes leaves dirty dishes around the house. She also *always* leaves garbage all over the house - loose garbage, garbage bags, garbage inside of boxes. Stacked on top of the couches, kitchen and coffee tables, lining the upstairs hallway. She has even left them directly outside of my bedroom door. Any time I ask her to throw them away, she either ignores me or gets mad and only throws away a fraction of what is there. She also has a habit of leaving items around the house and telling me where I need to put them. She will not have even physically left yet, so she is perfectly capable of moving these things, but she will tell me where I need to put certain items away (this in her room, that in the garage, ""you can find a spot in the dining room""). The one time when she was getting ready to leave, I asked her to finish putting her one plastic tote away because it was in the dining room. She snapped at me and told me she needed help because it was too heavy (it was not heavy, I'm pretty sure it was bedsheets and pillows). Because it was actually light, she was able to move quicker down the basement steps. The problem is that she purposefully went down the steps so fast that I slipped and fell down a few steps, even after I told her multiple times to slow down otherwise I would fall. Also, that means she was consciously planning on leaving a ""heavy"" item for me to do on my own, which she has done on multiple past occasions.

I mentioned the ADHD earlier because I feel like some things could be forgetfulness, and that I can understand. But she is also incredibly stubborn and has tried in the past to intimidate me into agreeing with her or apologizing. She's gotten in my face multiple times, even after I've already disengaged from the conversation. If it's a disagreement about something easily Google-able, she refuses to look at the screen and just gets progressively angrier at me and doubles down. She also largely does not believe me when I tell her about distressing things from my past, and other than brushing it off with sarcastic looks and telling me along the lines of ""that never happened,"" she also tries to one-up me the majority of the time. And I know she brushes this all off as being best friends and ""sisters"" but I have never felt that way. She has also said people have ""lost the art of friendship"" and that friends ""just do things for each other."" My thing is, I would never ask or expect any of my other friends to do any of this. My friends also think this is crazy and sort of gaslighty and wouldn't ask this of me either.  I need outside opinions because none of my friends really like her so they may be biased. So is this normal? Would you guys do any of this to your friends? What the heck do I do because I would personally be embarrassed if this was my behavior

Choosing the Best Rated Hydrogen Water Bottle for Your Lifestyle
----------------------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen water bottles have captured the attention of many health enthusiasts. They are designed to infuse regular water with hydrogen molecules, which is said to enhance hydration and provide various health benefits. But with so many options available on the market, how do you choose the best rated hydrogen water bottle that suits your lifestyle?

First, consider your primary purpose for using a hydrogen water bottle. Are you keen on health benefits, or do you need a convenient way to hydrate while on the go? Understanding your needs will help you narrow down the options. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:

**1. Size and Portability**

- If you travel often, look for a compact and lightweight model.
- Consider a bottle that fits in your car cup holder or backpack easily.

**2. Material**

- Hydrogen water bottles come in various materials, typically glass, stainless steel, or BPA-free plastic.
- Glass bottles are often preferred for their purity, while stainless steel offers durability. Plastic can be lightweight and portable but may affect the taste of water.

**3. Hydrogen Production Method**

- Electrolysis is a common method used to infuse hydrogen. Ensure the bottle you choose has a reliable electrolysis mechanism.
- Some bottles produce hydrogen on demand, which can be more efficient.

**4. Ease of Use and Cleaning**

- Look for a bottle that is simple to operate. One-touch operation can save time and enhance your experience.
- Ensure that the bottle can be easily cleaned, as hygiene is crucial.

**5. Battery Life and Charging Options**

- Check the battery life, especially if you plan to use your bottle frequently.
- Many bottles come with USB charging, which can be handy for travel.

After evaluating these factors, it’s beneficial to look for reviews on the best rated hydrogen water bottle. User feedback can provide insights that specifications alone cannot offer. When analyzing reviews, focus on details like durability, functionality, and customer service experiences. Popular brands often stand out due to consistent quality and thoughtful design.

Additionally, consider the price range. While it's tempting to go for the cheapest option, investing in a high-quality bottle can lead to a better experience and longer lifespan. A bottle on the higher end of the price spectrum may offer features like superior hydrogen production or better materials.

**Top Features to Look For:**

- **Hydrogen Concentration:** Aim for bottles that provide at least 1000 ppb (parts per billion) of hydrogen.
- **Self-Cleaning Function:** This can save you time and ensure your bottle remains bacteria-free.
- **LED Indicators:** Some bottles come with indicators to show when the water is infused, making the process more user-friendly.

One popular option among users is the **HydraMATE Pro**, which boasts high hydrogen concentrations and a sleek design. Alternatively, the **H2Cap** has garnered attention for its portability and unique design, making it a favorite for those constantly on the move.

Another well-rated choice is the **Germann Water Bottle**, known for its robust construction and efficient electrolysis system. Reviewers often praise its ease of use and impressive hydrogen output per cycle.

Remember, adjusting to using a hydrogen water bottle might take some time. Start by replacing your regular water intake with hydrogen-infused water gradually. Monitor how your body responds and stay flexible with your routine to find what works best for you.

Ultimately, selecting the best rated hydrogen water bottle should align with your lifestyle, preferences, and health goals. With careful consideration and research, you can hydrate effectively while enjoying the various benefits that hydrogen-infused water has to offer.

Health Benefits of Drinking Hydrogen-Enriched Water
---------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen-enriched water has been gaining attention for its potential health benefits. As more people seek ways to enhance their well-being, understanding what hydrogen water can do for you is essential. This special type of water contains dissolved hydrogen gas, which may offer several significant advantages.

### Potential Antioxidant Benefits

One of the notable features of hydrogen water is its potential antioxidant properties. Antioxidants play a crucial role in protecting our cells from damage caused by free radicals. Studies suggest that molecular hydrogen can effectively neutralize harmful radicals, helping to reduce oxidative stress in the body.

### Improved Athletic Performance

If you’re an athlete or someone who enjoys regular exercise, hydrogen water may provide a performance boost. Research has shown that drinking hydrogen water can help reduce fatigue, improve recovery times, and enhance energy levels during workouts. This could mean better endurance, allowing you to push a little harder and longer during your activities.

### Support for Metabolic Health

There is growing interest in the effects of hydrogen water on metabolic health. Some studies suggest that it can help improve insulin resistance and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. For those looking to manage their weight or blood sugar, incorporating hydrogen water into your daily routine may offer some supportive benefits.

### Skin Health and Hydration

Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining healthy skin. Hydrogen water, with its unique properties, may enhance skin hydration and promote a youthful appearance. Some users report improved skin texture and reduced signs of aging when they consistently consume hydrogen-enriched water.

### Potential Neuroprotective Effects

The brain is highly sensitive to oxidative stress, and maintaining its health is crucial as we age. Some preliminary studies indicate that hydrogen water may have neuroprotective effects, which could support cognitive function and memory. While more research is needed, these findings are promising for those seeking to maintain mental clarity and focus.

### Reducing Inflammation

Chronic inflammation is a common issue that can lead to various health problems. Hydrogen water has shown potential in helping to reduce inflammation markers in the body. This could be beneficial for those dealing with arthritis, autoimmune conditions, or other inflammatory diseases.

#### How to Incorporate Hydrogen Water into Your Routine

Integrating hydrogen water into your daily life is simple. Here are some easy ideas:

- **Start Your Day:** Replace your morning coffee or tea with a glass of hydrogen water for a refreshing start.
- **Pre-Workout Hydration:** Drink it before exercising to help boost endurance.
- **Throughout the Day:** Keep a hydrogen water bottle handy to sip on throughout your daily activities.
- **Enhance Recovery:** Enjoy hydrogen water after a workout to help with recovery.

### Choosing the Right Hydrogen Water Bottle

When selecting the best hydrogen water bottle, consider several factors to ensure you are getting a quality product. Look for bottles that:

- **Generate High Concentrations:** Choose ones that create a higher level of dissolved hydrogen.
- **Are Made from Safe Materials:** Ensure the bottle is made from high-quality, safe materials.
- **Have Good Reviews:** Check for testimonials from other users on effectiveness.

Before making any changes to your diet or health routine, it's always wise to consult with a healthcare provider. They can provide tailored advice based on your individual health needs.

Drinking hydrogen-enriched water may offer you a variety of health benefits. From boosting athletic performance to improving skin health, this innovative hydration method is worth considering as part of your wellness journey.

### Conclusion

Selecting the best-rated hydrogen water bottle can significantly enhance your daily hydration routine while aligning with your lifestyle needs. As you explore various options, consider factors such as capacity, portability, and ease of use. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in ensuring that you can enjoy the benefits of hydrogen-rich water wherever you go. A high-quality bottle not only improves convenience but also guarantees that you are consuming the optimal amount of hydrogen to support your wellness journey.

Embracing hydrogen-enriched water opens the door to numerous health benefits. From boosting your energy levels to enhancing your overall performance, hydrogen water can be a game changer in your daily health regimen. Many users report improvements in recovery times after exercise and reduction in inflammation, making it an ideal choice for athletes and active individuals. These advantages stem from the antioxidant properties of hydrogen, which combats free radicals and promotes a healthier internal environment.

By making a mindful choice in your hydrogen water bottle, you set the stage for embracing these health benefits more fully. Whether you’re at home, the gym, or on the go, having the right bottle always within reach keeps you prepared to enjoy hydrogen water’s revitalizing effects. Investing in the best-rated hydrogen water bottle is more than just a purchase; it's a step toward a healthier and more vibrant lifestyle. Your journey to improved hydration and well-being starts with simple yet powerful changes, and choosing the right tool is essential to that transformation.

We’ve been friends since 1st grade. Not attached at the hip, just friends. Middle school we started really taking and becoming friends. High school, we started dating, and junior year we got pregnant. It was an incredibly difficult time. We stayed together; but really we were just trying to see if we could be with one another and be parents. After two years of dating after having our child, we still loved one another, and had very similar beliefs and values. We got married and were very happy. That however was when we were 17 and 18. Still very young. Fast forward to 22 and 22, and he discovered some new things about himself. As did I. We talked it over and decided we still loved each other the same, if not more, and wanted our family to continue. During this entire time we each had “friends” but more so just acquaintances we talked to at work. This last year my husband and I both started a job at a company. He over time became actual friends with another woman there. I also became friends with her. She is engaged and getting married next month. I started to become jealous of the attention my husband would give this woman. I want to express it was never crossing any boundaries, he just had never had a real friend before, that was more than a work friend, and started treating her as such. Everytime he would buy me coffee, he would ask me if she wanted anything. When he got to work he asked me how my day was, and then would go ask her. Genuinely harmless things. So why am I jealous of them? I am trying so hard for work through these feelings and overcome them. I know it is most likely due to there being a new dynamic in our relationship. And I don’t want to hurt him or make him feel like he can’t have friends, so I haven’t said anything. I want to just work on this myself and learn to adjust to this new chapter in our lives. We have been together a really long time, and every step of the way that we have grown as our own people, it had just grown our relationship. I love him and who he is. And he isn’t doing anything that crosses a line or is inappropriate. I just am having such a hard time with him having this level of care for someone else. Which is completely unhealthy and unfair. Has anyone else felt this or been in this position? How can I relax and chill out? I feel so selfish and horrible right now. ",4,1737870018.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

Some context on me, I am a SDE make decent money save 50% of it as well. Have my finances mostly sorted, some of it happened by reading posts on this reddit, so I wanna give back to the community.

A few months ago I began realising that I am dipping into my emergency funds towards the last couple days of the month. (Its in HDFC as a sweep in FD so it acts as my savings account fund when needed, so I don't realise it when I spend it). Not a big deal, but still a red flag.   
  
I started tracking where my money was going because I never really buy much expensive stuff. Analysed all the transactions and came to see that 40% of my spendings are on Swiggy, blinkit and Instamart. (ordering once a day atleast either for grocery or some coffee)

Funny thing is that It is happening without me even realising it over 6 months. I have been trying to get back control over it. A couple things I did are 

1. Got a chrome extension that shows me the monthly spends in realtime on Swiggy, just so I have a constant down trend. (Its pretty neat, hopefully they add Blinkit & Instamart in there too)
2. Been trying to go grocery shopping on Sunday's and stock up for atleast next 3-4 days. (Small fridge to can't do 7 days)

Its been a month since the breakup. We had a great relationship and were best friends. He was always adamant that we were going to get married and it was expected within the next 1-2 years. Two weeks before we broke up, he told my brother he was going to marry me. He was always closer to my family because we went to school right near where my family lives. His family lives 5 hours away. He also has a larger family so it was more intimidating for me to get to know them. 

I went to visit his family over Christmas. We exhchanged presents & he asked for a coffee machine from me so, when we live together, we can eventually use it. We made plans for his brother to stay at my house during new years eve. The next day, we went on errands and he said he was stressed. He said he was stressed about me and family. I laughed and said why would you be stressed about me? He said his mom and sisters have been telling him to breakup with me. I was immediately offended and hysterical. He said that I dont like them and dont make an effort. He said his mom said he should date someone more like her and someone who is more outgoing. He said maybe we arent meant to be and maybe they are right that he needs somebody different. He also said his mom is worried I want to live near my family (my dad has a chronic illness). I have only always said I wanted to live near my family for at least 1-2 more years but apparently that means we want different things out of life. I felt betrayed and blindsided and said its apparent I am not welcome here and he packed up my stuff in my car and I left. 

After the fact (and after I drove 5 hours home), he refused to call me for clarity and said if he did he ""wouldnt be able to tell me whats best for us."" We briefly texted and he declined all my calls. The next day, he didnt answer any of my texts or calls still. He ended up blocking me that night and my dad called and left a voicemail to ask him to talk to me about this as I was in hysterics. I woke up the next morning and my whole family was blocked as well. I tried messaging him through snapchat and whatsapp and was ignored for days and was eventually blocked on snapchat. I drove to his apartment at school, just to seek clarity, and I messaged him I was here to talk. He texted me back that he will call the police if I didnt leave (I wasnt knocking, screaming, or crying. I just texted him I was outside - its like a 30 min. Drive from my house). 

Since then, he has completely ghosted me and has seemingly just forgotten about me. I feel so extremely betrayed, confused, and blindsided. I dont know how to move on from this. Its like he changed overnight. Ive never been a crazy person. I always trusted him wholeheartedly and gave him freedom to do whatever he wants. I dont know what to make of any this.

How do I get him to understand it's effecting me negatively?,"I recently moved into the apartment my bf and I rent together. Ever sense he helped me move he's called me a horder. I can't stop feeling bad about it. Mind you I am pregnant so I didn't have a lot of energy to pack and organize the way I should have. He keeps insinuating I get rid of my stuff the wild thing is I don't hord and I don't have that much stuff. My sister even told me I'm the exact opposite of a horder. He's coming from a situation where he's renting a room and I've lived on my own for the last 4 years. So of course I have all the household goods and decor. I do collect vintage toy (that could all easily fit in a medium size box) but I have a nice little organized spot for them in another room he doesn't use along with a small box of crafting supplies. I do have a lot of clothes but i wear them and when i get new clothes i get rid of old clothes. Most of everything I have  fits in the closet that's nice and organize. The kitchen is spotless. In fact the only things that stay on the counter are a bowl of spatulas and olive oil. My bathroom has NOTHING on the counters unless I'm actively using it. Funny enough his bathroom has 5 or 6 things on the counter at any given time. Everything fits nicely in the cupboards with extra room. I've already gotten rid of a bunch of things and it's not enough.  The thing is he's not even nearly as clean or organized as I am so I don't see what the heck the problem is. His reason for calling me a horder is because when I moved it took 5 trips.when  I refused to part with 3 of my plants he said that's what horders do.  All those plants i had gotten from clippings and worked hard to keep alive or brought back to life. I got rid of multiple other plants but chose these 3. Small plants mind you. It's making me feel terrible. Because who wants to live with a horder? He doesn't see the problem with calling me a horder and doesnt see what it's doing to my self esteem. Especially when I clean daily theres nothing in on the floor, nothing on the kitchen counters, nothing on the dining table, coffee table ext. I put everything away. I feel like I'm being gaslit. I have hobbies and I actively participate in them. I've been scared to buy anything to do with those hobbies for fear of another snide comment. He's perfectly happy just watching TV and laying in bed but I'm not. How do I make him see reason? Because he mentions almost daily at this point and I'm not sure what else I can get rid of.

Last but not least, the love of my life and my future wife has not shut me out of her heart completely yet, despite many mistakes I have made. By mistakes I just mean times I failed to set boundaries and communicate my needs while reassuring her of how much I love her. When I overextend myself, I hurt and that hurt turns to resentment/hatred and then I become mean and hypercritical and downright unpleasant to be around. Then she withdraws (understandably), I get scared, and I try to control the situation any way possible, damaging things further. It's a pattern I have repeated many times over the years but I am steadily improving with experience.

This year, I would very much like to have no coffee except on July 1st, watch no porn, have less if any sex, workout at least 3 times per week, get more than 6 hours of sleep on average (preferably 8), and say only kind things to people. I believe there is a time and place for both coffee and sex, but I've been frying my brain with excessive pleasure for years and the consequences are quite widespread. Time for some detox and healing stability. So far, I'm doing a great job with all of these goals.

Anyways, I had a restorative day today and simply want to pass along the good feelings in an effort offset the hateful posts I have made previously. We all deserve happiness and we are all capable of obtaining it. If you're not happy, don't sit there and suffer. You might be surprised at what you are capable of if you just take the first step. You might just need some reassurance and validation to bring out the immaculate strength and beauty that is already inside you, waiting to be let out. And sometimes you might *think* you need something when really you need something else, and you'll only realize what was missing when you experience it again by chance. Goodnight and good luck.",0,1737869357.0,GNV,6,0.33,False

another house posted on instagram too saying that they are doing cob and to dm them, and i dmed and sent a follow up text a week later and still have heard no response.

it was originally more of a break despite us calling it a break up, then this month we made it more official. we originally kept some casual, friendly contact, but tonight we've completely cut off all contact. he wants to be a better person and try to move on because he believes rekindling something that hurt us so much wouldn't be good. i still had hope maybe we could in the future, and i guess hearing that from me made it finally click that no matter how much we may still have feelings for eachother now, it'll only hurt more to keep contact knowing i still am deeply in love with him with no plans to move on currently.

we agreed that if we ever saw eachother out and about after a year or so, we'd go out for coffee or something like that just to talk about how things are going. it almost sounds like my life has turned into a book or something, except chances are we won't get back together again after that conversation and will just go our seperate ways. 

it all hurts so much. ive been trying to focus on myself, and i have made progress, but i love him so much and i miss him as well. im almost scared to run into him in the future because of the possibility that ill only gain feelings again or even just want to be friends. and i know that with being friends, especially if he's managed to work on himself, ill probably fall in love all over again.

maybe its just first love blues and ill move on, but right now i miss him so much and i wish things went differently. i almost want to imagine we'll meet and talk and reconnect, but i dont want to get my hopes up, so im trying to just focus on myself entirely. 

does anyone have any tips on stopping yourself from reaching out after starting no contact? or just general tips after a break up that still had two people who loved eachother but who had to go their seperate ways? sorry for the long post. ",1,1737868885.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

What to do?,"(Had to repost—forgot to put length of relationship in original post)

A few weeks ago, after four years of dating and ongoing efforts trying to address communication issues with my (27F) boyfriend (27M), I decided to tell him that certain aspects of communication are “boundaries” or dealbreakers for me, and that if he does not think he can work with me on the issue, that was fine, but I needed him to be honest with me so I could figure out what that means for me. This came about because I felt like he would respond in ways that I didn’t think were very constructive when I would try to discuss relationship things/issues. It was getting to the point where I felt like the relationship simply wasn’t working, and a change was necessary. The “boundaries” I gave him are as follows:

* Need to be able to constructively talk about problems in the relationship 
* Need him to respond productively if I bring up a problem to him

In the moment, he said he thinks those are good, healthy boundaries and he wants those things to. He assured me that he can work with those boundaries, and that he wanted to put effort in to talk more constructively about problems that I bring up. In the moment, I felt like the conversation went well.

However, for the past few weeks since then, I have felt as though our relationship is struggling more than it was before the conversation, and I’m questioning whether he even likes me anymore.

Example: he has ceased attempts at initiating physical touch. He seems very lukewarm toward me when I come home from work, sometimes not even stopping what he is doing (playing a video game, doing something in his office) long enough to say hello to me. On our free evenings, he would rather play video games than hang out and do something together. He seems very annoyed with me at times, quick to comment or make a critical note about each mistake I make (dropping my phone, spilling coffee grounds). And it feels like any time I ask a question or say something that could even remotely be seen as critical, he gets all tense and irritated—like when I asked him if he was going to clean the shower this week like he said he was going to, or if I suggested pulling the car up a little when parallel parking to not block a driveway. If I have tried to bring any of this up, like asking why he seems annoyed, he rolls his eyes or makes expressions like he can’t believe he has to deal with my concerns again. 

I feel like this started shortly after the boundaries conversation, though at the time he did seem like he agreed with me about pursuing those goals. Can anyone provide insight on to why he may be acting this way, or advice on how to resolve the situation? 

Thank you for any and all help!

TL;DR: I communicated a boundary to my boyfriend, telling him that I need him to be able to respond constructively when I bring up problems to him. He agreed at the time and said he wanted to work on it. Since then, he has been acting distant and irritable with me, as well as generally uninterested.

I was also drinking maybe a little to much then, I stopped drinking for like 3 months or so and ate really healthy, I ended up slipping up and eating more unhealthy but I figured since I started statins it would be okay and when I went back in 3 months my cholesterol was perfect and my ALT normal.

1ia6kjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ia6kjw/the_ultimate_guide_to_choosing_the_right_lighting/,The Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Right Lighting for Every Room in Your Home,"# Lighting is one of the most crucial aspects of interior design. It does more than just illuminate a space—it sets the mood, enhances decor, and defines functionality. Whether you're choosing hanging lights for your living room or exploring options for your outdoor space, the right lighting can transform your home into a haven.

Here’s a room-by-room guide to help you pick the perfect lighting, along with insights into popular options like [black hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) and [pendant lights in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights).

# 1. Living Room: Create a Focal Point with Hanging Lights

The living room is where aesthetics meet functionality. [Hanging lights for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) not only provide illumination but also act as statement pieces.

**Key Tips:**

* Use a cluster of pendant lights to create a centerpiece over a coffee table or seating area.
* Opt for dimmable fixtures to adjust brightness based on activities—whether you’re entertaining guests or enjoying a movie night.
* For modern interiors, sleek black hanging lights offer a sophisticated, contemporary look.

**Pro Tip:** Pendant lights in Dubai often feature intricate designs and unique materials that blend luxury with local craftsmanship. Explore these options to add a touch of elegance to your living room.

# 2. Dining Room: Elegance Meets Functionality

The dining room deserves lighting that complements the table and creates a welcoming ambiance. A large pendant light or a series of smaller ones hung directly above the dining table is a classic choice.

**Best Practices:**

* Choose fixtures that align with your table shape. For a rectangular table, use a row of pendants, while a single large pendant works beautifully for round tables.
* Ensure the light hangs low enough to illuminate the table without obstructing views.
* For a bold, dramatic look, black hanging lights are a fantastic option to add contrast and depth.

# 3. Kitchen: Bright and Functional Lighting

Kitchens require bright, task-focused lighting. Pendant lights are perfect for illuminating kitchen islands and countertops, blending style with practicality.

**Lighting Ideas:**

* Use multiple pendant lights to evenly distribute light over a long island.
* Choose fixtures with easy-to-clean materials to handle kitchen splatters.
* Add under-cabinet lighting for additional brightness and functionality.

# 4. Bedroom: Relaxing and Cozy Atmosphere

Lighting in the bedroom should promote relaxation while maintaining functionality. Bedside pendant lights are an excellent alternative to traditional table lamps, saving space and adding style.

**Design Tips:**

* Install dimmable lights to create a calming ambiance for evening routines.
* Choose warm light tones to promote relaxation.
* For a modern touch, incorporate black hanging lights with simple, sleek designs.

# 5. Bathroom: Bright and Clear Lighting

Bathrooms need bright and evenly distributed light for tasks like grooming. Consider layering lighting with wall sconces, recessed lights, and a central ceiling fixture.

**Quick Advice:**

* Avoid harsh, overly bright lights. Use diffused lighting for a softer effect.
* Place lights on either side of mirrors for even illumination.

# 6. Outdoor Spaces: Inviting and Functional

Outdoor lighting is essential for safety, ambiance, and extending your living space into the outdoors.

**Outside Hanging Lights Ideas:**

* Use [outside hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/lighting/outdoor-pendant-lights) to illuminate patios, balconies, or pergolas. Choose weather-resistant materials for durability.
* String lights or lantern-style pendants create a warm, inviting glow for outdoor entertaining.
* For a sleek, modern look, black-finish outdoor fixtures add style and sophistication.

**Why Choose Pendant Lights in Dubai?**

Dubai offers a diverse range of lighting options that cater to every design aesthetic, from luxurious chandeliers to minimalist pendants. Pendant lights in Dubai are renowned for their intricate designs, high-quality materials, and ability to blend traditional and contemporary styles. Whether you want a statement piece for your living room or elegant outside hanging lights for your patio, Dubai’s lighting collections offer something unique for every home.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing the right lighting for your home is all about balancing functionality and style. From hanging lights for the living room to outside hanging lights, the right fixtures can dramatically enhance your space. Don’t shy away from bold options like black hanging lights to make a statement, and explore the wide variety of pendant lights in Dubai for unparalleled elegance.

I'm truly just exhausted. I know I've done a lot of things that I shouldn't have due to my people pleasing tendencies (situationships, setting no boundaries, etc..) but even when I would stand up for what I wanted, I'd still end up hurt.

Typically, things will be going great up until I bring up the exclusivity conversation (\~2 months in). That's when they decide to end things with me. It's just this repeating pattern of really great dates with someone I can see a future with, being open to them about how I feel with them reciprocating those same feelings, continuing to date, and then things ending when I bring up wanting exclusivity.

I don't even want to put the blame on the men I'm choosing to date. They've all been so different since I don't have a type. Short, tall, well off, unemployed/full time student, etc...

  
I can't help but to feel like it's me. I feel like I'm not good enough for love. Maybe they saw too many of my flaws and that scared them away? I probably don't look as pretty as I thought I do without makeup. Maybe my personality is just shit? Am I too chaotic of a person? Sometimes I let my childish side come out and maybe it was too weird for them. I'm spiraling with these self deprecating questions and It's mentally and emotionally exhausting. I used to embrace all of my weird quirks and flaws but now I feel the need to hide who I really am in fear that people will throw me away. I've even let this fear affect the way I interact with potential friends. I hate who I've become.

Before I just used my crappy hand-me-down smartphone to get some pictures, messing with filters and whatnot and posting them to my old Instagram account. Anyway, I decided to take a trip by myself and my dog at the time to a state park near me in Illinois. This was my first mistake.


Now, I haven't been to this state park in years. I remember going on a family outing there to hike and spend some quality time together. But that’s when weird things started happening. I think I got separated from my parents and sister at one point. As I was walking through the trails, I got a little light-headed. It was sometime during summer so I had just assumed I was getting too hot. I took a second and sat down underneath a tree to collect myself. 


Then, I distinctly remember seeing a person standing on top of a cliffside, staring down at me. I couldn’t make out any recognizable features, only that it was maybe a woman. I passed out. Next thing I knew, I woke up in the family car, heading back home.


My parents didn’t know what happened, they just thought I had gotten lost and passed out from heat exhaustion. I thought that too. But that woman that I saw always lingered in the back of my mind, and ever since, I had these odd nightmares. Visions of death and decay, almost like how the seasons change and the plant life begins to wither away. It scared the hell out of me. But they weren’t common enough to cause concern, to me at least. That’s also when I noticed this longing to return, an odd pull at the base of my neck, like softly pulling on the string of a package. 


It was a crisp autumn morning. The leaves all changed from a verdant jade green to beautiful bright oranges, reds, and yellows. A slight breeze carried the fallen leaves across the streets, almost as if they were dancing. The earthy scent of decaying leaves wafted through the air. I woke up at an early 6 AM (which was way too early for a teenager who never woke up before 8 AM), took my dog outside in the backyard while I made a cup of coffee. Her name was Holly, and she honestly was the best dog I have ever had. She was a beautiful Czech shepherd, with a mostly tan coat with white and black markings. I only say “was” because she died of cancer a few years later (nothing happened to her on this day, thank god). Holly never was your stereotypical “crazy, intense, and hyper” shepherd like most people think. She loved snuggling and lounging around the house. We really got super lucky with her, not being a very active family. Which always makes me wonder: why did I even go out and do this in the first place?


I finished making my coffee. I stared as the dark liquid streamed into my travel mug, almost getting lost in a trance from how tired I was, but I quickly snapped out of it. I brought Holly back inside and got her hooked up on her harness and leash, packed up my camera, and quickly told my parents my plan for the day. I would be going out to get some pictures at a state park a few hours away. They seemed confused as to why I would be going. Normally I just stay around town and snap pictures of local wildlife, Cardinals, Mourning Doves, and any deer I rarely come across. But, I just had some feeling, like a soft gravitational pull to go out there. I just brushed them off, saying something like “I just want to.” I didn’t have a specific reason.


I gathered all of my things: my backpack, camera, coffee, granola bars and some water and threw it all in the passenger seat of my ‘08 silver Chevy Impala. I fucking loved that car. It always had problems but man the stereo in that car was so sweet. I loved blasting metal through them and just driving for hours. I miss that rust bucket. Holly eagerly jumped into the back seat and we set off for the state park.


I had some time to myself (and Holly too) before we got there. I was trying to think of what I wanted to photograph. I hadn’t been to this state park in some years, maybe back in 2009 was the last time? I’m not sure. But I do remember there being this beautiful waterfall cascading out from a cliff face. That was the main attraction, and the reason people went there. I knew I wanted some shots of that, but felt like I could do better. I think there was a cliff that overlooked a massive forest. I could get some pics of that too. Animals aren’t all that common there since there’s typically a lot of foot traffic but I was hoping to see some different birds. Maybe a Common Nighthawk, or even a Cooper’s Hawk (one of my personal favorites).


During my drive, I started thinking: “why do I even want to go?” I hadn’t been there in years. Yet here I am, driving down there on a random weekday, with just my dog and my camera. That slight, almost minute pull I’ve been feeling. Almost like something is tugging at the base of my skull, telling me I have to go to the state park.


That there’s something I need to see.


I don’t know what it is, don’t know where, and still don’t know why. 


After driving for about an hour or so, I realized I never had breakfast. I pulled off to a diner and decided to grab a quick bite to eat. Thankfully they had a drive thru so I didn’t have to get out of the car. I pull up to the window, ask for a breakfast burrito and some hash browns, and pull into one of the parking spots so I could eat. I pulled out my phone to check my messages but the reception out there was so bad it wasn’t loading anything. Oh well. I rolled down my window and decided to people-watch. I remember getting some odd looks, mainly from older men in their trucks. Seeing a long-haired masculine person with painted black nails and a nose piercing was probably the closest thing to seeing an alien was to them, I was used to that though, growing up in a mostly rural area of Illinois, I’d always get weird looks.


As I was sitting there, eating my burrito and sharing some of my hash browns with Holly, a guy in a beat-up red pickup truck pulled up beside me. I don’t really know cars, but after looking it up, I think it was some old ford f-150 or something. The thing was rusted to hell, missing a side mirror, and the oddest thing, it had these long, deep gash marks across the side of it, almost like someone had taken a knife and cut through it as if it were made of butter. He parked next to me and I got a better look at the guy. He was mid to late 70’s, maybe 80’s, I'm not too sure, with a yellow-ish white beard that just went past his neck. His piercing green eyes staring back at me through small, cracked glasses that rested on the end of his nose. He scowled at me for a few seconds, and I just stared right back at him. He then broke the silence, speaking in a gruff, almost smoker-like voice:


“You ain’t from ‘round here, boy?”

“No.” I replied, a little hiccup in my voice could be heard.

“Well, whatchu doin’ here then? We don’t take well to your ‘kind’.”

“Your kind”? The hell does he mean by that?

“Just going out to the state park to get some pictures.” I’m now starting to get a little unnerved by the guy, I just wanted some breakfast!


The man didn’t respond for a few seconds. He looked like he was thinking. I took this opportunity to get a look inside his truck. I saw his interior was also torn up, like the outside of his truck. Sitting next to him in the passenger seat was a firearm (I don’t know guns, just kind of looked like a hunting rifle). Normally, I wouldn’t think much of it, this guy seems like a hunter. But with the state of his truck and how weird he’s being, some alarms were going off in my head.


“Well, just be careful. There’s been some reports of people goin’ missin’ up in them woods. If I were you, I’d be turnin’ back now, while y’ still can.” There was an almost eerie tone to his voice, like he was trying to warn me. But after the “your kind” comment, I didn’t really care about what he had to say.


“Alright, well thanks for the advice.” I say, stuffing down the rest of my breakfast. The guy just stared back, as if he was trying to bore holes into my skull with his eyes. Eventually, he pulled out and left as quickly as he came.


What a weird ass guy. I thought to myself. I looked back at Holly and she was sitting up in the backseat, staring towards the diner. I called out her name, but she didn’t move. I went to pet her and she snapped out of it. She seemed a little anxious. Weird. What that guy said got me thinking, and so I decided to do some amateur detective work. I hopped out of my car, grabbed Holly and went to the outdoor seating area at the diner to ask some questions. I saw an older woman drinking a cup of black coffee out of a cute porcelain mug, she seemed nice enough. As I was walking towards her, I noticed her eyes, swiftly darting between me and Holly. 


“Hi, I just had a few questions. I haven’t been out here in some time and was wondering who that guy was in that beat up red truck?”


The woman, maybe in her late 60’s, sat her cup down and looked up at me with warm, brown eyes that mirrored her coffee. Her white hair slowly cascading down to her shoulders. She had an odd familiarity about her, but I couldn’t pinpoint it.


“That was Reggie. He’s kind of an odd guy, always goin’ around town hootin’ and hollerin’ ‘bout how the government is lyin’ and that they puttin’ microchips and whatnot in our brains to turn us into a zombie army or whatever. Most folk here don’t pay him much mind, but when he finds someone he don’t recognize, he’ll sure as hell try to freak ‘em out.”


Yeah, that makes sense, he seemed crazy. I’m all for conspiracy theories but that’s a bit much.


“Okay, and he said something about people going missing up at the state park down the road, what did he mean by that?”


The woman got really quiet. She took a sip of her coffee, set it back down, and looked deep into her mug.

	
“Oh, he was prolly just tryin’ to scare ya. You seem like a capable man, I wouldn’t worry too much ‘bout it.” She gave a soft and warm smile, her teeth stained yellow from years of coffee and probably smoking.


I thanked her for her time and walked back to my car. She sounded genuine about her last statement, but her facial expressions and body language gave off the feeling that she was scared, or worried. As I started my car back up again and looked up, the woman was staring right at me. I gave her a smile and a wave but she just stared back, motionless and expressionless. I felt like her gaze would swallow me whole.


I drove down a winding road, through leafless trees with the dying leaves flowing behind my car. Eventually, I made it to the parking area, pulled into a spot and began to gather my things. It’s around 8 AM at this point, and there were a few other cars around. Nothing out of the ordinary, people come here a lot to hike or exercise. I got out and felt the cool autumn breeze rush past me. It’s soothing, lifting the worries I had on my drive here away. I let Holly out and take her off leash. She’s really good about staying with me and I keep the leash on me, ready to attach it in case another dog comes. I take my camera out of my bag and begin snapping some photos of the area, testing the lens and making sure I have the settings right. 


One of the cars in the lot looks familiar. It’s Reggie’s truck, banged up and scratched to all hell. It's pretty recognizable so I know for a fact that he’s here. I snapped a few pictures of it. I’m not really sure why, maybe because of how weird our conversation was. I do notice something odd about it though. When I made my way up to it, I noticed that his gun, which was sitting in the passenger seat next to him, was gone. That made me uneasy, an old guy walking around a forest trail with a whole ass rifle? But I dunno, maybe there’s some back trails that he uses for hunting. At least I hoped.


As I begin to walk towards the main trail, I feel a rush of uneasiness wash over me, like a wave of freezing cold water. I stare down the path with the trees arching over it, like a monstrous maw about to devour me whole. Then a pair of joggers walk past me, talking about their run this morning. That snaps me out of my daze that I was trapped in, and I quickly shrug it off. My mind is telling me to drop everything and leave, that I shouldn’t be here. But I want to do this, I need to. And so, I begin to take my first steps onto the trail.


It’s a pretty nice walk. It’s paved in most areas, a pretty easy trail for practically anyone. Like I said, I'm no avid hiker or outdoorsman so I knew this wouldn’t be too taxing on me. Holly is trotting around, sniffing around for anything to investigate. Every so often a person or two will walk past me, and Holly stops to say hi. She’s such a glutton for attention, but she is pretty cute so I can’t blame anyone for wanting to say hi.


I eventually made it to the waterfall I spoke of earlier. The white water cascading down the rocky cliffside, forming a massive pool of clear blue water in the basin. It really is beautiful, especially at this time of year. The blues and whites from the water pairing nicely with the oranges and yellows of the autumn leaves. Nobody else is here, which is kind of odd, especially with the amount of cars that were in the parking lot. This area is a lot bigger than the paths so I let Holly walk around a little farther from me. I take out my camera and begin getting some pictures of the waterfall and the surrounding area. Kneeling down on a rock off to the side, I aim the camera near the basin. Click! Though that wasn’t the sound of the camera shutter, it sounded like a rifle being cocked. I look up from out of my camera’s viewfinder and see Reggie, all the way at the top of the waterfall. Looking down at me, gun in hand.

	
“Holy shit, you scared the hell out of me!” I shouted, trying to make light of the situation, despite the fact this man is armed with a firearm.

	
“I told ya not to come here, boy.” He sneered and spit down on the ground next to him. 

	
“Why? There were a bunch of other people here, why can’t I come?” I was starting to get annoyed. Why does he not want me to come here so badly?

	
“You felt it, didn't ya? The pull to come here. You couldn’t explain why, you just needed to, right?” His voice was low, and really ominous. How did he know? I took a second to gather my thoughts.
	

“...yeah, I suppose.” I replied, a little wary of how we would respond.

	
Reggie took a second, like he was thinking, then said: “Come up here, boy. I wanna show ya somethin’.”


Reggie slung his rifle over his shoulder. What is this guy’s deal? First he’s threatening me, and now he’s trying to be friends? He’s going to kill me, I just know it. Reggie is going to shoot me dead and leave my body to become ravaged by the fungal growth, assimilating with my withered corpse…


What the hell am I thinking? I shake the thoughts out of my head, and call Holly over to me, leashing her up and finding a safe way up the cliff face. I remember having these thoughts when I was younger, but they were just nightmares. 


I eventually make it to the top, slipping and tripping all the way, and see Reggie, his back to me, crouched over something.

	
“So, what did-”


Reggie holds his hand up, and cuts me off:

	
“It’s close, we have to be quiet.”


He gestures to me to come over. I slink over, not even thinking why I need to be quiet, and take a look. It’s a pile of animal corpses, all mutilated and bloodied. Bones shattered and heads torn asunder. I step back and gag, almost throwing up. But I compose myself, and that’s when I notice, growing amidst the heap of gore: tiny mushroom caps, consuming the decaying mass of bodies. Just like in my dreams and visions. 

	
“What did this?” I ask him, in a hushed voice.

	
“The Beast. I been huntin’ it for over a decade now, and ‘round these parts, the thing is like a ghost. Once you spot it, the thing takes off and vanishes.”


What he said sent a chill down my spine, and I think even Holly could tell, she started whining and panting real hard. What the hell did he mean by that? I’ve been here before and never even heard of such a story. This sounds like some shit you’d hear in a movie or something.

	
“I haven’t heard of it, maybe just some coyotes or wolves  did this?” Despite the fact I photograph wildlife, I don’t really know all that much about animals.

	
“No. Wolves and the like always eat their prey. This thing likes to toy with it, play with it. It never eats what it kills, only displays it in its territory.” Reggie sounded serious. I thought he’s just trying to scare me so I never came back, but he sounded like he was scared. 

	
“Well, have you seen it?” I asked, thinking he might be mistaking it for a bear or something.

	
“Yes. It tore up my truck and almost killed me. The thing is ‘bout 20 feet tall, maybe more. It's got these massive claws, sharp as razors, and huge, long fangs comin’ out from its mouth. It’s body seems to be a mass of plants, or mushrooms, I don’t really know.”

	
“Okay… do you know anything else about it?”


“I don’t think it likes canines. I’ve never seen it kill wolves or nothin’. If I were huntin’ it, and somethin’ started howlin’, it would just vanish.”

“Huh, well maybe we should just get-”


Reggie cuts me off:

	
“No, we have to get to my cabin, it’s already got our scent. You’re stuck with me now kid.”


Great. I tried to object but he just stared back at me. His eyes darted everywhere. I could tell he was frightened.


I followed Reggie through twisted brambles and fallen trees for maybe 15 minutes. I’m not really sure. But it’s just now I've noticed that my head is starting to hurt. I normally get headaches when I overexert myself, but this is different. It’s like a knife is being plunged into my brain stem, and whoever is wielding it is playing around with it, not trying to kill me, but torture me. If only they would drive it in, deep into the soft, squishy gray matter, splattering the brains everywhere and leaving a horrific mess of gore to be consumed by the underbrush. The ravenous fungi- 


There it is again. The thoughts of murder, blood, and entrails. What the hell is going on? Everytime those thoughts appear, tiny red trails appear at the edge of my vision, and I get this insatiable feeling to be consumed. Not eaten by another person. But by nature. To decompose and return to the loam of the earth, and become a part of the cycle of nature. I’m no psychopath. Is it these woods that’s doing it to me? Or could it be…

	
“We’re here.” Reggie walks up to the door to his cabin, unlocks it, and walks inside. I had been so out of it, lost in my thoughts that I was just on autopilot, and didn’t even notice it. It’s dilapidated. The harsh elements of wintertime have worn away the wooden walls. He doesn’t seem to come here often. I don’t even know where we are anymore, I can tell Holly is getting anxious. I kneel down and pet her, trying to calm her down.

	
“I know girl, I’m scared too. We’ll get going soon, I promise.” I whisper to her, giving her a soft kiss on top of her head. 


I step in through the almost collapsed doorway and into the cabin. It’s small, one giant room with a cot, a wood-burning stove, a table with a chair, and some camping supplies. Reggie stands over the table, looking down at a map laid across it. I sit down and take a look. The map appears to show the area of the park. It’s a lot bigger than what I remembered. And etched across it in red marker are a few X’s.

	
“This here is a map of the area. These X’s are spots where I’ve encountered the beast. And this here is where we are.”


Reggie points at a circle, I noticed something odd though. All of the X’s form a circle around his cabin. No, not a circle, a spiral. Reggie points at the outermost X.

	
“This was my first encounter with it. I was drivin’ down the road and the thing ran out from the forest. I almost hit it, but swerved into tree. It then ran up on me and attacked my truck. I got out and ran, and it eventually ran too. Ever since, I’ve had that strange pull towards this place, that feeling that I need to be here. Like you do.”


I stayed quiet, pondering. Have I seen this creature before? Is that why I feel like I need to come back?

	
“So, do you think I encountered this ‘beast’ before?” I asked. I felt stupid even entertaining the idea.

	
“Mhmm. I believe this thing, whatever it is, wherever it’s from, drives a nail into one’s mind, making them come back to it, so that it can do…. Whatever it does with people.”

	
“So you still don’t know why it kills?” I asked Reggie. He just shook his head.

	
“Nope. But I gotta ask” Reggie narrowed his eyes and leaned down towards me. “Are you gettin’ thoughts? Thoughts of hurtin’ yerself or others?” 


I could tell this question made him anxious, like he was preparing himself for my answer.

	
“...no, not that I can think of.” I lied, I just had a feeling he would shoot me right then and there.

	
“Good, cuz once you do, the beast has gotten too deep in your thoughts and it’ll do somethin’. I dunno what but I know it’s prolly not good.” Reggie stood back up and walked over to a small lockbox next to his cot, opened it up and turned towards me.

	
“You’re gon’ need this. We’re goin’ out and killin’ that thing once and for all.” I looked down inside the box and saw a pistol. I was shocked. I’ve never held a gun before, let alone shot one. I think Reggie could tell.

	
“I can’t be the only one with a gun out there, and plus if I die, you gotta be able to protect yourself, kid. Take it.”


I grasp the cold, metallic gun and look at it. My heart dropped into my stomach. I can’t do this. I won’t do it.


“Kid, you good?” Reggie asked. I shake myself and come to. I nod and stand up.

	
“Can I leave my dog here? I don’t want her getting hurt.” I asked Reggie. He nodded and brought a bowl with some water and gave it to her.


I kneel down and give Holly a kiss and a hug.

	
“I’ll be back girl, I promise.”




We had been walking for what felt like an eternity. It was already around 2 PM. I checked my phone a few times, but with the reception out here being so bad, I didn’t have any hope of calling or texting anyone for help.

Reggie had told me that we were going to follow its trail. The creature seems to leave some sort of path in its wake. Wasn’t sure what he meant by that, but it made sense when we got to it. The trail was maybe 10 feet wide, winding and twisting its way through the brush. Normally, I would have just chalked this up to some old hiking trail that never saw use in over a decade. But, the path seemed to be composed entirely out of various fungi.

I was starting to get lost in thought, just staring deep into the odd walkway of mushrooms. The image of falling into it, letting the growth take over my body. Dissolving my existence away into nothingness…


“Look kid…” Reggie spoke, his voice trailing off for a second, breaking the silence of the hike.


“I hadn’t been completely honest with ya.” Oh great, is he gonna tell me how I’m eternally fucked? I thought. My mind raced with thoughts, but I kept my mouth shut, waiting for Reggie to speak.


“Now, I did see the beast that night on the road. But it wadn’t just me in my truck. My son was also with me.” His voice croaked with the last few words being spoken.


“Yeah? Is… is he okay?” I sheepishly asked, knowing full well I knew what his answer would be.


“...No. He died that night. The Beast grabbed him. It tore him apart.” I could tell Reggie was about to cry. It seemed like this night still played on repeat in his mind.


“Shit, I’m really sorry.” I responded. I had no idea what to even say. “What was his name?”


“Danny. Loved comin’ out with me on my huntin’ trips. Though never had a real compassion for it, just loved nature I s’pose.” Reggie’s voice was shaky and shuddering. I don’t think he’s ever told anyone.


“Sounded like a nice kid, Reggie.” I was feeling incredibly uncomfortable now. I was never great with consoling people, let alone when it came to the death of a child.


“...yeah. He was. Loved him to death.”


Reggie sighed and composed himself.


“Now I spend every wakin’ moment trying to avenge him. That thing won’t get away, not now.” Reggie seemed almost invigorated. 

	
“So… what’s the plan?” I asked Reggie.
	

“We find it. We kill it.” He replied.


Fantastic plan you got there Reggie. I was already getting thoughts that we were screwed. The thing was gonna jump on us at any moment and we were done for. 


Reggie taught me how to use the pistol as we were walking and it helped me feel a little more confident, but knowing what we’re going up against doesn’t help whatsoever.

	
“So when we do find it, we just start shooting? Or what?”

	
“No, we’re gon’ talk to it, have some coffee and make friends. Of course we gon’ shoot it!” I could tell Reggie seemed frustrated.


“I been followin’ this trail for the past year or so.” He said. “With how elusive the beast is, it’s been rather hard tryin’ to find its lair. This trail always just seems to end. Right…”

Reggie’s voice trailed off for a second, as he was still following the path the creature took.


“Here.” He stopped, and pointed down. I didn’t notice what he was showing me, but then I realized. The monster’s tracks ended in a mushroom circle. 


“Weird. Animal tracks don’t typically just stop in the middle of them.” I said. Reggie looked over at me and nodded.


“This is the reason why I haven’t been able to get this thing. These tracks seem to just stop, with the beast vanishin’ into thin air.” Reggie’s voice got really quiet near the end, and he dropped to the ground and pulled up his rifle.


“Now be quiet, I hear somethin’.” At first I didn’t know what he was talking about, but then I heard it too. Whispering maybe? No, too loud. But not loud enough to be talking. But even if it was, it didn’t sound like any language I knew. Just kind of sounded like gibberish, coming from a cluster of trees just ahead of us. Reggie held up his rifle and peered through the scope. I tried to get a better look but couldn’t see much through the thick foliage.


Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder, opposite Reggie, and a strong force hit the back of my skull and everything went dark.



I wasn’t sure how long I was out for. I had some pretty haunting dreams. The sensation of peeling the flesh from my body, like skinning a soft potato. Ripping out my organs and consuming them, ravenously, as if I had never eaten before. Other people were surrounding me, all humming that same gibberish chant, in a vast expansive void. 


I’m slapped awake, and notice I’m in another cabin, tied to a wooden post nailed to the back wall. I look over and see Reggie, still and lifeless on the floor, tied up just like me. I take a second to gather myself, the light from the candles burning around the room, burning my retinas. Then, I realized that someone was standing over me.


“Who are you? And how did you get here?” the person speaks, in almost perfect english. It sounds like they have an accent, Germanic? Maybe Scandinavian? I couldn’t really tell, but I know that people from the midwest don’t have those accents.


I groggily blink my eyes and lick my lips. “I.. uh… I’m not… sure…” I reply, still a bit out of it from the blunt force trauma to my skull, which I can now feel the cold trickle of blood streaming down the back of my neck.


“I will ask again. Who. Are. You?” the person repeated, seemingly unsatisfied with my answer. I eventually told them my name, and that I came here with my dog to just take some pictures, but got wrapped up in something with Reggie. 


I try to get a good look at the person standing over me, but their face is covered with some burlap sack, stained with blood. They’re wearing some old outfit, like something you’d see back in the medieval times. Like some dark wool tunic and weather-worn trousers.


The person stands back up, and another walks in, wearing another burlap sack over their head. They walk over to Reggie, and kick the side of his chest. He coughs and rouses from his unconsciousness. The two people then start conversing in some language that I can’t understand. It sort of sounds European, but I just can’t figure out where.


The first person walks back over to me, and unties me from the board I was restrained to, leaving my hands still bound. They lift me up and begin to walk me out of the cabin, along with Reggie.


Walking through the doorway, what I thought was only an hour or so, turned out to be maybe 5 or 6, with it being completely dark out. We appear to be in some kind of camp, with two other wooden buildings. In the center, is a circle of candles, and a long wooden pole, maybe 30 feet high, that stands in the center of the ring. 2 other people are standing just on the outside of the candles, humming to themselves.


The person walking Reggie takes him to the center, whilst I am held back. They tie him up to the pole, slap him a little to make sure that he is awake, and then take a few steps back so they are outside of the circle, and also begin to hum.


The person shoves me down to the ground, and stands on my feet. I’m completely trapped. I could try to run, but I have no idea where I am, and if any of these people are armed. I knew I’d be screwed, so I just went along with it. 


One of the people began to start chanting something. It’s that same chanting that Reggie and I had heard earlier, before we were taken. I still can’t figure out what they’re saying, but it seems like a few English words break through. Something like “Harvest” or “Decay” but I’m not too sure. And there’s one word that stands out to me, it almost sounded like a name, Disir? I’m not sure.


The chanting was getting louder and louder, a crescendo of voices all collapsing into one harmonious song. Then, it all stops suddenly. A quiet wind blows through the camp, with the only sound coming from Reggie and his ragged breathing. 


I spot something in the trees lining the camp. It definitely wasn’t there before. A massive creature, maybe 15 feet in height, its eyes reflecting back the light from the candles, with the rest of its body cloaked in shadow. And that’s when I feel it, the light-headedness that I felt years ago when I was here with my family. Have I seen the creature? I couldn’t have, it’s massive and I definitely would have known if I had seen something like that. I look around nervously at the others. They don’t seem to notice. Rather, they are intentionally not looking at it, all with their heads bowed in silent prayer.


Then, in a flash, the creature is suddenly in the center of the camp, and now I can finally get a good look at it. It seems to be some sort of conglomeration of plants and fungi. Its massive, tree-trunk-like legs hold up its almost elephant-like body, with each three-toed foot ending in long, sickle-like talons. It has a thick neck that ends in a huge mass of circular mushrooms where a head would be, with several antlers jutting out from the top of it in unnatural ways. Two, beady black orbs for eyes stare down at Reggie as spindly “arms” unfurl from its body and grasp the sides of his head. 


Reggie begins to scream, the only sound coming from him that tells me he is aware of what's going on. The creature slides him up the pole so he is eye level with it. A loud, tearing sound can be heard as the creature’s “head” splits in two vertically, straight down the middle. Two rows of jagged and serrated teeth jut out from the maw. Then, a faint, pale green light seems to emanate from the mouth of the creature. As Reggie stares into it, he stops screaming, and goes limp, staring right back into it, as if he is stuck in a comatose trance. Small tendrils begin to writhe out of the creature’s mouth and wrap around Reggie’s head, before pulling it in. And with a single swift crunch, tears his head clean off and drops his body to the ground with a loud THUD.


As that happens, the other people begin a loud, discordant prayer, before stopping after a few seconds. Then, the creature looks at me. I felt my stomach drop. 


I was next.


The person grabs my hands and yanks me towards the pole. I start shouting and screaming, fighting the whole way, but the person’s grip is too strong, and I was too weak and tired. They tied me up to the pole, and the creature had retreated back to the tree line. I didn’t even see it move. They then walk back to the outer ring with the others and they all begin their chant once more.


I’m now sobbing hysterically. I don’t want to die. I thought I was a good person in life, I didn’t deserve this. But maybe I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. 


The beast was then instantly in front of me. Its small, lanky arms protruding from its body grasped the sides of my head and pulled me up towards it. The same ripping sound can be heard, as its head splits once again. I got a better look now. It’s mouth was a cyclone of fangs, and at the back of it’s “throat” looked to be a… face? A familiar face.


It was the old woman at the diner. She was staring right back at me from the cavernous maw. Expressionless, just like before. Where the arms came out from the creature would be where hers would be on her body. Was she the creature? She opened her mouth and that same emerald glow returned, coming from her mouth and eyes, and I was instantly in a trance.


The tentacles started sprawling out and began to wrap around my head. They were cold, lifeless, and uncaring.


Just as I was about to accept my fate, I heard barking in the distance. The light faded as she closed her mouth. The tentacles retreated back into the creature’s maw and it seemed to get scared. It dropped me to the ground and turned to the others.


The other people stopped chanting and started shouting to each other in their language, seemingly in shock, anger, and nervousness. They started rushing around, trying to grab whatever they could, but the creature seemed angered with them, as it turned and began to eviscerate everyone else.


The creature was fast. Faster than the human eye. With swift movements, the people seemed to just explode into a burst of gore. No screams, no cries of pain or agony, just instant death.


Out from the outskirts of camp, the barking grew louder. And as I looked, I was in utter shock. It was Holly! She somehow broke out of Reggie’s cabin and heard my screams. She saw the creature and began barking and snarling at it. It’s almost as if Holly knew it would be scared of her. The creature let out a massive shriek and ran off into the woods.


Holly ran over and sat down in front of me, panting and licking my face. I just sat there for a second, sobbing and babbling incoherently. I was finally able to compose myself, and freed my hands from their bindings.


Shakily, I stood up and gathered my things. I walked over to the body of Reggie and just stared. It was disgusting, seeing someone decapitated, but I felt sorry for him. I felt responsible for his death even though I knew this probably would have happened to him eventually. 


I wanted some answers. Who were these people? Why are they out here? And what was that thing?


I decided to look through the bodies around me. I didn't find much, but the first person who talked to me had a small journal, in an inner pocket of their tunic. I take it out and examine it. It’s maybe the size of a pocket bible. Leather-bound, and seemingly homemade. On the front, it had a single word carved into it: Dís. I began flipping through some of the pages. All of it was in some language that I couldn’t read, but that word kept coming up. I could see runes inscribed on some of the pages. I recognized some of them to be Norse. I slipped it into my pocket.


Norse runes? Are these people from Scandinavia? What the hell were they doing there?


I decided to take a look in the other cabins of the camp, to make sure there was nobody else to come after me. It appeared to be a bunk room, with 8 beds situated on the left and right walls. I only noticed 4 people, where did the others go?


I walked over to the last building which was larger than the other two, with massive double wooden doors. Each had a large rune engraved on the front of them. The one with eight lines coming out from the center, and each of them ending in a prong shape? I see people get tattoos of them sometimes. I swung the doors open. The dark chamber beckoned me to enter.


Walking inside, this building appeared to be some sort of worship hall. Pews lined the center and at the very back was an altar. On the far back wall, behind the altar, was a mural depicting some woman with long, flowing hair, holding a sickle in one hand, and some grains or wheat in the other. Is this who they were worshipping? Is this the woman from the diner?


I walked up to the altar and found another book resting on it. This was another leather-bound bible, though nothing was written on the front of it. I flipped it open, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that it was all in that same language. Frustrated, I slammed it shut. I gave a big sigh and left the way I came.


Holly seemed anxious to leave. I knelt down to her and gave her some pets, telling her that we’re leaving now.


In the distance, I could hear it. The howls of the monster echoing throughout the forest. I know it still was wanting something, but I wasn’t going to stick around to find out.



The drive home was quiet. Holly was passed out in the back seat, she seemed just as tired as I was. I eventually got reception and a flood of texts and missed calls hounded my phone all from my parents. I called them back, saying I had lost track of time and fell asleep in my car and that I was on my way home. I didn't really know what to tell them, I knew they wouldn’t believe me.


Ever since, the nightmares and visions slowly faded away. The influence the beast had on me waned, but whenever I get a glimpse of that journal, I feel that pull to return. With it still being alive, I’m sure it will worm its way back into my skull. Every so often, I think back on that day. I know what I saw, and I know that I shouldn’t have.

My gf really wants to reorganize things and i want to surprise her with a good design but i suck at that stuff.   
  
we dont have a couch or coffee table yet but we do have a dining table(56in) and a tv stand(58 length by 16 width.) Couch and coffee table are a must for the living room, and to the right of the living room where the measurement stops is the kitchen island. 

Bedroom design advice is also needed as we need to shuffle stuff around to give a fresh feel to the room. she doesnt have a night stand yet but she wants us both to have one (in the end idc if i get one) and the one she was looking at was about 16x12. 

We have a weird bed, its 76 length by 78 width. our gaming tables are 55x31.5. 

The two doors in the bedroom are 34 inches (2in shorter than shown) and the two doors in the living room are 30 inches (6 inches shorter than shown)

Any advice or designs would be amazing, feel free to ask any questions.

Looking to elevate your living room with that [cozy-yet-chic modern farmhouse](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/modern-farmhouse-living-room-decor-ideas/) vibe? This trending style strikes the perfect balance between rustic charm and contemporary elegance. 

Imagine a warm palette of neutral tones like beige, cream, and soft grays paired with natural textures like reclaimed wood, linen, and jute. Add pops of greenery through plants or rustic planters to bring life to the space.

Start with a statement piece like a shiplap accent wall or a distressed wood coffee table. Layer it with a plush sofa featuring oversized throw pillows in soft fabrics. 

Add in farmhouse lighting—think industrial-style pendant lights or cozy sconces. Don’t forget to accessorize with vintage-inspired décor like woven baskets, chunky knit throws, and antique-style wall art.

To tie it all together, include modern touches like sleek black metal frames or minimalist shelving units for a fresh, updated look. The result? A space that feels both welcoming and polished—a true reflection of modern farmhouse style.

So, couple days ago one of you posted a similar haul. I was with a coworker and they were asking me about hot wheels as I got them on my desk and walls. I was telling them that this Redditor just literally got the cars I've been looking for and that I couldn't even find one. Well, I walk into work this morning and on my desk are the cars, and the bumblebee is the metallic one on top of even finding it. What's my next move here!?! I gotta ask on a date right?!

[Mini update](https://www.reddit.com/r/HotWheels/s/p0ouJcKSnQ)  **Jam 17, 2025**

Couldn't edit to add an update, so here it is: 

Had a super shitty day at work, then Sam stopped by at my office an hour before the day ended, she had me giggling like with in 30 seconds of her stopping at my door. We got to chit chatting talking about the impending doom texans are about to face and what we had planned for the weekend, she said she was just gonna be home and probably be bored, I could see the hints being dropped but my brain was just not picking them up and I was starting to panic, so I just looked at her and said ""go hot wheel shopping with me tomorrow, ill show you what the hunt is like, we can grab lunch"" boys. she jumped out of the chair and said yes! my heart was racing lmao. Anyways, we got a day tomorrow planned for hot wheel shopping and lunch, and maybe a movie idk, bowling? I was thinking arcade.

[Update on Sam, the Hot Wheels, and our date.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HotWheels/s/iT6HFgAbPL)  **Jan 19, 2025**

A lot of yall wanted an update and I got lots of DMs about it! See down below! TLDR at the end.

Well, we went on our date! 

I dusted off my other ride in the morning, gave it a wash, then gave myself a wash, stopped at Starbucks for our usual, then headed to her place to pick her up. I got out and went up to her door, coffees in hand, took a breath and knocked on the door. She opened the door and immediately was all smiles, I practiced which coffee was hers so naturally I gave her my cup even though I knew hers was in my left hand, but anyways, after fumbling with that we started walking back to the car and she’s immediately noticed I was not in my daily. I daily a Camry TRD, and my fun car is an Audi S6. She’s questioning me about it, and I’m telling her it’s my other ride that I take out on special occasions. She’s gushing over my car you guys. Noticing all the little things and commenting on things I had done to it. I have this emotional support vehicle sticker on my quarter windows and she was having a laughing fit over it. 

Anyways, we went off, we went across Houston to different Targets, Walmarts, DTs, FDs, Krogers, stopped at an Ulta to buy some hair stuff she wanted, took note of some of the stuff she liked and had picked up and placed down, and I made it point to stop by the colognes under the guise that I might want something to see what she liked since the perfumes are right next to the colognes. Plan on getting her a little basket of stuff for Valentine’s day. Then, around 2 my stomach makes a whale call in the car, we laughed about it and decided on sushi, so I took her to my go to sushi spot. While we’re eating I’m dealing with the whole Overdrive thing, so naturally I word vomit more hot wheels like an idiot, but she was engaged the entire time. We finish up eating, and we go walking to this arcade called Cidercade, arcade and hard ciders. We played games and drank for a couple of hours, the day was gorgeous was decide to go walking downtown some more, its getting kinda of hot for me so I took me hoodie off and she pretty much gasp and it hits me, she’s never seen me without long sleeves. I have a half sleeve tattoo. She grabs my arm and immediately is like oh my god the detailing is great, I love this, and I’m literally blushing and at the same time getting the biggest confidence boost that idk what took over me but I just grabbed her hand and we continued walking. We had been flirting the entire day, the bumping each other, the giggling, the weather, the drinks, it all just felt right. We locked fingers and kept walking, swinging hands, just chit chatting. At this point I just wanted to know more about her felt like I had vomited everything about me, so just kept on asking more about her and learned a lot aside from the superficial stuff I already knew from work. Couple more hours of walking, two ice cream cones, we decided to go back to my place to hang out and listen to some music. We arrived at my place and what’s waiting for me at the door? Big ass box of hot wheels, the sealed set arrived. This day could have not been better. I moved it inside, let her in, show her around, showed her the garage, my bike, more hot wheels, showed her my plants, where I work out, the stray cat that won’t let me adopt him but uses me for food, showed her the neighbor who hates me because the bike is annoying or whatever. We decided to continue to drink and listen to music up until maybe 2am. We danced battled, we played Jenga, made a frozen pizza, burned it, still ate it. 

Come bed time I offered to uber with her back to her place and I would uber back since I didn’t want her to go alone and I wasn’t in any condition to drive or I offered my spare bedroom or my bed if she was comfortable. She elected for my bed. Gave her a t shirt, hoodie, new pair of boxers, some joggers, and we went to bed. We cuddled all night long into the morning. I woke up first in the morning, didn’t want to be a creep and just keep staring at her, she so beautiful btw, anyways, got up, and made coffee and a breakfast scramble with toast, she woke up as I was wrapping up cooking, gave her a toothbrush, momma said you alway gotta have spare toothbrushes at home, we had breakfast, talked a bit more then I drove her home. She kissed me good bye, didn’t slam my door, and when I got home, I went to clean the car, in my passenger door, was a scrunchie. IM OFFICIALLY MARKED LMAO. 

She did text me 30 minutes or so after I dropped her off that she had a great time and thanking me for everything. I told her that she still got me smiling and that I open to hang out again whenever she wants. She hearted my message and said she’s looking forward to the next one. So yeah…. I’m head over boots here. Guys……. I think she IS the one. We’ve known each other for like 2 years now. She was the person who trained me when I got hired, and sadly I quickly got shuffled into another department so we didn’t each other as much but we always would teams each other to go to lunch and what not. About 8 months ago one of directors got let go, shook up the entire tree, moved my boss up and somehow I inherited his role, and then Sam’s department got merged into mine. She was now in my office space so I would make it a point to have candy in my desk and print my documents at the printer closer to her office so that I had a reason to go over there and drop off a jolly rancher or whatever. Not sure why I honestly took this long for us to make it out of the office, but I’m extremely happy it finally

TLDR: Took my date hot wheels shopping with me, we had sushi, went to an arcade, drank, had ice cream, my 2024 factory set arrived, we danced, burned a pizza and ate it, she slept in my boxers in my bed, we cuddled all night, had breakfast, my car has a scrunchie in its door pocket now.

>>It really does. Car guys in general are ""hard to date"" because of our hobbies, I've had girls dump me before exclusively because of my interest, so you're correct, finding a girl who embraces and even joins me in my hobbies has never happened before.

My dad has been texting me, asking how i am, saying he misses/loves me and wants to see my apartment sometime. 

(I didnt respond right away and said we can go to a diner or cafe sometime) *because i dont feel comfortable with him coming to my apartment. He then ghosts me for over a month. Came back and said almost the exact same thing and then ghosts again.  

Why? 

Backstory - my relationship with my dad has always been distant, especially after my parents got divorced when i was 8 years old due to his affair. 

When i was 8, He told me to lie to my mom about his remarriage , introduce me to her and her daughter (at 8) and basically forced a child whos parents just split, to accept his new family and keep it a secret from my mom.

Last time i remember us being close is around this time , where we would basically hangout together , go for coffee etc, one thing that stuck with me is my dad calling me while i was in middle school and telling me to lie about the pearls i wore to his new wedding (because my mom found them) 

He told me to lie and say it was from a ""dinner"" with his coworkers. Mind you, he called the teachers phone WHILE i was at school and told me to tell her this. While i was during class!

Our relationship was always a push and pull - and i never really felt important to my dad , he never took an interest in me and i was there to listen and absorb his feelings/interests. 

Growing up it remained the same , more distant as i got older and he started to ghost me - disappear when i finally had my own opinions/questioned/argued. I wasnt important to him anymore, since i couldnt be controlled. This is how i felt most of my teenage/youth and it led me to just go 0 to little contact. 

My grandpa *his dad* died recently and i never really processed my emotions , because i was there to console him...even tho it was my grandfather too. 


Recently, he has been texting me on and off , sending overly nice texts and then ghosting. I feel weird that he keeps mentioning coming to see my apartment - when we dont talk at all and after he refused to help me move into it last minute after i ""disrespected him""

He keeps sending the same kind of texts , about my apartment , then ghosting when i dont agree.

When we got older I took on more of a big sister role helping her out with stuff like boyfriend trouble, borrowing money, letting her stay at my house for weeks at a time, getting her jobs at the places I worked.

In 2023 she got pregnant with her ex, decided to keep the baby and raise them alone. I say alone, her parents are both retired and give her money and babysit for her overnight at least x2 days/nights a week. Throughout her pregnancy I saw her most days (as she works at the same place as me) and after work I would often take her for dinner to chat about her situation, housing options etc and just basically be a shoulder to cry on. 

I organised her baby shower and although I don't have much money at all, I spent a lot of time and effort into the theme she picked and the certain props she wanted for photos (she's very into social media so the pics were almost the most important thing for her). I also made sure on any of her sad, bad days I treated her to her craving foods and bought her pamper hampers full of little treats and things for her.

After the baby was born she just totally dropped me. Wouldn't reply for days if at all to my texts, didn't want to meet up. When she got her new house I asked if I could come visit and she said she didn't want anyone to see it until she had finished decorating and had a house warming party. I thought fair enough, then found out from a colleague that she had been and seen the new house and baby. There was lots of little incidents like this, like babies 1st birthday was coming up and I asked if she was having a party, she said yes but only people with kids were invited as it was £8 a head. 

I'm now 31 weeks pregnant myself. When I told her (she was one of the first to know) I was 8 weeks pregnant and she seemed really excited for me. She said she would come to appointments with me and to antenatal class etc and I was really looking forward to spending more time with her again. 

At 12 weeks I asked if she would organise my baby shower, and she said of course she'd love to. That was pretty much the last time I properly spoke to her face to face. I've had a really difficult pregnancy due to finding 8+ large fibroids that have grown Throughout my pregnancy (a couple are over 15cm now) and severe hypertension. I haven't been able to work since October so I have been home alone, not really leaving the house much since.

I text her in November with my guest list and asked her if she thought I'd missed anyone, a few days later she messaged back ""send this to me again in the new year lol"". So second week of January I messaged her again, after literally hearing nothing from her, asking if everything was still okay for the baby shower? At this point my dad who lives with me at the moment due to having x2 heart attacks and a stroke in the last 2 years had been in hospital with a pneumothorax since NYE. this is her uncle, her mother's twin who had visited him in hospital so was well aware he was sick. Not once did she message asking how he was doing, until she replied to my message asking about the baby shower, she just threw it in there like ""happy NY, how's your dad doing? Yeah I was thinking about it and I can't do your baby shower as I'm broke atm I'm so sorry"". 

I understand, she's a single mum and on a tight budget. But i told her back in November that I literally wanted a really low key meet up. No decorations or anything or photo ops (i hate my picture taken), literally people meeting up at a coffee shop or something for tea and a chat. It wouldn't have cost her anything... just her time. I know she's busy with the baby but honestly the kind of baby shower i wanted wouldn't have taken long to organise. 

I never have parties or things and don't usually like being the centre of attention, but as a ftm who could use the advice and being so lonely, I was actually really looking forward to it. I was so disappointed and upset when she said she wasn't doing it i still haven't replied to her message. 

I can't even ask anyone else, it's too short notice and I distinctly remember when I was planning her shower, I asked her opinion on something and she got mad saying ""you pick otherwise I may as well organise it myself, and there is nothing more pathetic than organising your own baby shower"".

My dad is on my side but thinks i should let it go just to save any tension within the family, but I'm really struggling with it. She hasn't once even messaged me to ask how I am during my pregnancy, and this feels more like she can't be bothered than her not being able to afford it.

Sorry this is so long and rambling, I've been going over it in my head for a couple of weeks now and just had to get it out! AIO?",6,1737866796.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

* Locking the screen (she waited until I got up for coffee)

Short Devotional about Just feel good

Introduction
------------

Do you ever find yourself caught up in the whirlwind of life, yearning for a moment to simply feel good? Perhaps you’ve experienced days where it seems impossible to carve out moments of joy and contentment amid the hustle and bustle. It’s crucial to remember that God desires for us to experience His peace and joy every day. This journey isn’t about ignoring the challenges of life but instead focusing on what fills our hearts with God’s love and light.

Imagine waking up each day feeling a sense of abundance and gratitude, not from external possessions, but from the inner joy that God provides. When we learn to just feel good from within, our perspective shifts, and we begin to touch others’ lives through the overflow of His goodness. This devotional is a gentle reminder to unlock and embrace the goodness that God has instilled within us as His cherished children.

Bible Verse
-----------

“Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!” — Philippians 4:4 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

In Philippians 4:4, Paul encourages us to rejoice in the Lord always—a command that might seem difficult in a world full of pressures and stress. Yet, the essence of this verse is a call to turn our focus toward God’s unchanging grace and love. Rejoicing is not dependent on our circumstances but instead on the unwavering joy found in Christ.

Paul, while writing this to the Philippians, was in a Roman prison, which underscores that even during times of great challenge, spiritual joy can prevail. This joy is rooted in our ultimate hope and faith in God. Rejoicing transcends mere happiness and touches the depths of our spirit, aligning us with the divine peace that surpasses all understanding.

As we immerse ourselves in this verse, we realize that to feel good is to open ourselves to the joy God eagerly wants to pour into our lives. This active choice to focus on Him rather than our fleeting emotions empowers us to live in a state of spiritual wellness and contentment.

Actions to Take
---------------

1. **Daily Gratitude Practice**: Begin each day by listing three things you are grateful for to center your heart on God’s goodness.
2. **Mindful Worship**: Set aside time daily for worship—whether through music, reading scripture, or prayer—placing God at the forefront of your mind.
3. **Positive Surroundings**: Surround yourself with people and environments that uplift and encourage you in your faith journey.
4. **Serve Others**: Find joy and purpose by volunteering or helping someone in need, reflecting God’s love to those around you.
5. **Rest and Reflect**: Take moments to pause, rest, and reflect on God’s faithfulness to cultivate peace in your spirit.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. What are some specific moments recently where you felt God’s joy in your life?
2. How can you shift your perspective to focus more on God’s goodness when challenges arise?
3. In what ways can you actively choose to rejoice daily, even if your circumstances are not ideal?
4. How do you define joy, and how is it different from happiness in your life?
5. What steps can you take to make your environment more conducive to experiencing God’s joy?

Prayer
------

Heavenly Father, I thank You for the abundant joy You have made available to me through Your presence. Help me to focus my heart on You, especially when life gets tough. Let Your joy overtake my worries and transform my days with Your peace. Empower me to be a light of joy to others, sharing the love You have so freely given. Guide my steps and open my eyes to see the blessings surrounding me every day. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.

Conclusion
----------

I had a difficult childhood and would stay at my Aunts, her mums, house a lot. When we got older I took on more of a big sister role helping her out with stuff like boyfriend trouble, borrowing money, letting her stay at my house for weeks at a time, getting her jobs at the places I worked.

In 2023 she got pregnant with her ex, decided to keep the baby and raise them alone. I say alone, her parents are both retired and give her money and babysit for her overnight at least x2 days/nights a week. Throughout her pregnancy I saw her most days (as she works at the same place as me) and after work I would often take her for dinner to chat about her situation, housing options etc and just basically be a shoulder to cry on. 

I organised her baby shower and although I don't have much money at all, I spent a lot of time and effort into the theme she picked and the certain props she wanted for photos (she's very into social media so the pics were almost the most important thing for her). I also made sure on any of her sad, bad days I treated her to her craving foods and bought her pamper hampers full of little treats and things for her.

After the baby was born she just totally dropped me. Wouldn't reply for days if at all to my texts, didn't want to meet up. When she got her new house I asked if I could come visit and she said she didn't want anyone to see it until she had finished decorating and had a house warming party. I thought fair enough, then found out from a colleague that she had been and seen the new house and baby. There was lots of little incidents like this, like babies 1st birthday was coming up and I asked if she was having a party, she said yes but only people with kids were invited as it was £8 a head. 

I'm now 31 weeks pregnant myself. When I told her (she was one of the first to know) I was 8 weeks pregnant and she seemed really excited for me. She said she would come to appointments with me and to antenatal class etc and I was really looking forward to spending more time with her again. 

At 12 weeks I asked if she would organise my baby shower, and she said of course she'd love to. That was pretty much the last time I properly spoke to her face to face. I've had a really difficult pregnancy due to finding 8+ large fibroids that have grown Throughout my pregnancy (a couple are over 15cm now) and severe hypertension. I haven't been able to work since October so I have been home alone, not really leaving the house much since.

I text her in November with my guest list and asked her if she thought I'd missed anyone, a few days later she messaged back ""send this to me again in the new year lol"". So second week of January I messaged her again, after literally hearing nothing from her, asking if everything was still okay for the baby shower? At this point my dad who lives with me at the moment due to having x2 heart attacks and a stroke in the last 2 years had been in hospital with a pneumothorax since NYE. this is her uncle, her mother's twin who had visited him in hospital so was well aware he was sick. Not once did she message asking how he was doing, until she replied to my message asking about the baby shower, she just threw it in there like ""happy NY, how's your dad doing? Yeah I was thinking about it and I can't do your baby shower as I'm broke atm I'm so sorry"". 

I understand, she's a single mum and on a tight budget. But i told her back in November that I literally wanted a really low key meet up. No decorations or anything or photo ops (i hate my picture taken), literally people meeting up at a coffee shop or something for tea and a chat. It wouldn't have cost her anything... just her time. I know she's busy with the baby but honestly the kind of baby shower i wanted wouldn't have taken long to organise. 

I never have parties or things and don't usually like being the centre of attention, but as a ftm who could use the advice and being so lonely, I was actually really looking forward to it. I was so disappointed and upset when she said she wasn't doing it i still haven't replied to her message. 

I can't even ask anyone else, it's too short notice and I distinctly remember when I was planning her shower, I asked her opinion on something and she got mad saying ""you pick otherwise I may as well organise it myself, and there is nothing more pathetic than organising your own baby shower"".

My dad is on my side but thinks i should let it go just to save any tension within the family, but I'm really struggling with it. She hasn't once even messaged me to ask how I am during my pregnancy, and this feels more like she can't be bothered than her not being able to afford it.

Sorry this is so long and rambling, I've been going over it in my head for a couple of weeks now and just had to get it out!",3,1737866096.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

The cafe’s bell jingled as Beau pushed open the door, a wave of warm air brushing over him. He spotted Sierra immediately—polished and poised as ever, sitting in her usual seat by the window. Her sleek black hair gleamed under the soft light, and her phone rested beside a half-empty latte. She looked like she always did: flawless, as if she belonged on the cover of a magazine.

For a moment, Beau paused, his hand lingering on the door frame. The sight of Sierra, perfectly composed and scrolling through her phone, sent a flicker of unease through him. It wasn’t anything specific, just a quiet, nagging tension that had become all too familiar. He shifted the strap of his bag on his shoulder, forcing himself forward.

She glanced up and smiled, her teeth bright against her lipstick. “Morning, handsome!”

“Morning,” he replied, sliding into the seat across from her.

“I went ahead and ordered for you. Same as always.” She gestured toward the counter, where a barista was placing a cup on a tray.

“Thanks,” he said. He appreciated the gesture—or at least, he wanted to. Instead, it felt like one more reminder of how Sierra always seemed to know what he needed better than he did.

She tucked her phone into her bag and leaned forward slightly, resting her elbows on the table. Her eyes sparkled with purpose, and Beau braced himself.

“So,” she started, her voice bright but laced with intent, “I talked to my father last night.”

His stomach tightened. That tone meant trouble. “Oh?”

“He knows someone at Bluewater Insurance. They’re hiring, and he thinks you’d be a great fit. He said if you send over your resume, he’ll make sure it gets into the right hands.”

Beau frowned, his jaw tightening. “Insurance?”

“It’s stable,” she said, as though that settled the matter. “It’s not exactly glamorous, but it’s steady, and the pay’s decent. You could finally move out of that tiny apartment and get something closer to me.”

Of course, that was the real point. Beau forced a polite smile, but his stomach churned. He couldn’t think of anything worse than sitting at a desk in some beige office building, selling policies he didn’t care about. But it wasn’t just the job—it was the thought of living closer to Sierra, of letting their lives intertwine in the way she so clearly wanted. The weight on his chest grew heavier.

“I like my apartment,” he said finally, though even to his own ears, it sounded like an excuse.

“Beau,” Sierra said, her voice softening in the way it always did when she was about to press harder, “you know it’s not enough. You’re wasting so much potential. And honestly, you’ve got that old house you inherited just sitting there, doing nothing. If you sold it, you’d have enough to get a decent place near me.”

Of course. The house. She always found a way to bring it up, like a splinter she couldn’t stop picking at. Beau exhaled sharply through his nose, the irritation resurfacing in his chest.

His gaze dropped to the swirling coffee in his mug. The house in Stonehaven was a knot he couldn’t untangle, a mix of guilt, grief, and memories he wasn’t ready to face. Every time someone brought it up, it felt like a trap.

“Sierra…” His voice was low, a warning.

But she pressed on. “Be honest,” she said, leaning forward slightly. “What’s the point of holding onto it? It’s been sitting there for two years. No one’s touched it. It’s just costing you money in taxes and upkeep. You could sell it and finally move on with your life.”

Move on. The words stung in a way he couldn’t explain. He hadn’t been back to Stonehaven since before his grandfather’s passing, and he knew that  he never wanted. The house wasn’t just some old property to him—it was tied to those last two summers spent before college, to Isla, to the life he’d lost in one horrible moment. But explaining that to Sierra felt impossible. She wouldn’t understand.

“It’s not that simple,” Beau said, his tone sharper than he intended.

“Why not?” Sierra pressed, her eyes narrowing. “It’s not like it’s some family home you grew up in. You’ve barely even been there, right? What’s holding you back?”

What wasn’t holding him back? Beau swallowed hard, trying to push down the wave of frustration rising in his chest. He could feel her words closing in around him, like a net tightening with every question she asked.

“I’ll deal with it when I’m ready,” he said finally, though even he wasn’t sure what that meant.

Sierra sighed, leaning back and crossing her arms. “You’ve been saying that since I met you, Beau. And let’s be real—you’re never going to be ready. At some point, you have to stop running and actually deal with your life.”

Her words cut deep, sharper than he expected. Running. She wasn’t wrong, but hearing it out loud made him feel like the floor beneath him had given way.

Beau stared at his mug, the swirl of coffee chaotic and relentless, like his own thoughts. She didn’t get it. She never had. Every conversation with her felt like a slow push toward a future he didn’t want—a life filled with shared calendars, compromises, and expectations he couldn’t meet. The truth settled heavily in his chest: he didn’t want the life she was trying to build with him.

Hell, he didn’t want to share a life with anyone. He could barely manage his own without someone trying to wedge their way into every corner of it. The thought snapped into place with startling clarity, sharp and unforgiving.

“I think we both know this isn’t working,” he said, his voice quiet but resolute.

Sierra blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

“I can’t do this anymore,” Beau said, finally meeting her gaze. “This… us… it’s too much. I feel like I’m suffocating.”

Her expression hardened, her hands gripping the edges of the table. “Unbelievable,” she said, her voice icy. “You’re blaming me for this? For trying to help you?”

“I’m not blaming anyone,” Beau said, standing. “But I can’t keep pretending like this is what I want.”

“Fine,” she said sharply, her voice rising. “Go ahead. Run away. That’s what you do, isn’t it?”

Beau pulled a few bills from his wallet and set them on the table. He paused, looking at her one last time, but the words he wanted to say wouldn’t come. Instead, he turned and walked toward the door.

As he stepped outside, the cold air hit him like a slap, sharp and biting against his skin. He drew in a deep breath, his lungs burning, but for the first time in months, the weight in his chest began to ease.
The door clicked shut behind him, and Beau let out a slow breath, shrugging off his coat and tossing it onto the back of a chair. The quiet of his apartment wasn’t comforting, exactly, but it felt steady—unchanging. He kicked off his shoes, leaving them where they landed, and sank into the chair at his desk.

The breakup with Sierra barely registered anymore. It had been coming for weeks, months even, and now that it was over, the only thing he felt was relief. His chest felt lighter without the constant push and pull of her expectations.

Beau opened his laptop, the glow of the screen highlighting the mess on his desk—a stack of unopened mail, an empty coffee mug, and a tangle of charging cables. His email inbox blinked to life, the usual flood of junk cluttering the screen. He was halfway through deleting messages when a subject line stopped him:

Subject: EchoWave Technologies – Job Offer

He sat up straighter, his eyes narrowing as he clicked it open.

We are pleased to inform you that after our discussions, we’d like to offer you the position of Senior Business Consultant at EchoWave Technologies. Your experience aligns perfectly with our needs, and we’re excited about the possibility of you joining our team.
For a moment, he just stared at the screen. The salary was there, big and promising, dangling a future in front of him like a carrot. This was it—the opportunity he’d been waiting for. The kind of job that could actually get him somewhere.

But the excitement fizzled out as reality set in.

The cost of moving to L.A. alone made his chest tighten. Deposits, rent, transportation—it all added up fast, and he didn’t have the savings to cover it. Even with the promise of a bigger paycheck, the gap between now and “settled” felt impossibly wide.

His gaze drifted to the corner of the room, to the stack of boxes from Stonehaven. His grandfather’s house. It was just sitting there, empty, racking up taxes and quietly bleeding him dry.

And just like that, the thought crept in, unwelcome and sharp: Sierra was right.
Beau sat back in his chair, exhaling through clenched teeth. The idea of selling the house had always felt abstract, something to deal with “someday.” But now? Now it felt more like a threat. He’d have to go back—to Stonehaven, to the house, to everything he’d been avoiding since the day he left.

His mind skated dangerously close to the memories he tried to keep buried: the accident, the life he’d been running from ever since. Stonehaven wasn’t just a place; it was a weight he wasn’t sure he could carry.

He pushed the laptop away, his hands balling into fists. Selling the house would mean facing all of it—Isla, the life they should have shared, the way everything fell apart. And to make it worse, Sierra’s voice echoed in his head, smug and unrelenting: You could sell it and finally move on with your life.

“Damn it,” he muttered, dragging a hand over his face.

The thought sat there, persistent and irritating, like a splinter he couldn’t ignore. He hated that she was right. He hated the house. He hated the memories. But most of all, he hated the idea that Stonehaven might be the only way forward.
Beau let out a long, frustrated breath and leaned back in his chair. The email glowed faintly on the laptop screen, the promise of a new future spelled out in neat, sterile lines. It should have felt like an escape, but between here and there stood Stonehaven—and that was a road he couldn’t bring himself to take.

He glanced at the clock. Barely noon. Too early to feel this drained, yet his body felt heavy, weighed down by problems he didn’t know how to solve.

With a frustrated sigh, he shut the laptop and pushed away from the desk. The quiet of the apartment pressed in on him, suffocating and still. Giving in to the exhaustion pulling at him, he made his way to the bed, flicking off the lights and collapsing onto the mattress.

The ceiling loomed above him, sunlight streaming in through the window and cutting across the room in harsh, unwelcome beams. He groaned, turning onto his side and pulling a pillow over his head, desperate to block out the light—and the decisions he didnt want to make. Sleep, he thought. Just sleep.

Chapter 2
The road stretched ahead, endless and slick, a pale ribbon of ice glowing faintly under the cold, indifferent light of the moon. Beau’s hands clamped the steering wheel, his knuckles bone-white, the tension crawling up his arms and into his chest. The heater sputtered, blowing weak, lukewarm air, but the inside of the car felt suffocatingly cold.

“You’re always like this, Beau!” Isla’s voice cut through the thick silence, sharp and brittle, vibrating in the small space. “Waiting until the last second, like things will just fix themselves!”

“Just stop!” he snapped, his voice rising, the words spilling out before he could stop them.

The air shifted instantly, heavy and brittle. His stomach twisted as he glanced at her—just a flick of his eyes, brief but enough to see her face. Isla sat stiffly, her profile half-illuminated by the dim dashboard light. Her jaw was tight, her lips pressed into a thin line. Her hand rested on her lap, fingers curled slightly, her engagement ring catching the glow in a soft, fleeting shimmer.

Then it happened.

The tires hit ice.

The car jolted violently, a gut-wrenching lurch that sent Beau’s heart into his throat. The steering wheel jerked in his hands, twisting against him as the car began to slide.

Time fractured.

The world tilted, spinning wildly as the tires lost all grip. The grinding roar of rubber skidding on ice tore through the silence, louder than it should have been, drowning everything else out.

“Beau!” Isla’s scream shattered through the chaos, raw and panicked, echoing in his ears as the headlights of the oncoming car grew impossibly large.

Everything blurred together—the blinding glare of the headlights, the sickening weightlessness of the spin, the deafening screech of metal meeting metal. The impact slammed into them like a freight train, a bone-jarring crunch that reverberated through every nerve in his body.

Beau woke with a start, his breath tearing from his chest in shallow, frantic gasps. His heart slammed against his ribs, the rhythm wild and uneven, as if trying to break free. His skin was damp with sweat, the sheets twisted around him.

The room was still too bright. The sunlight poured through the window, casting sharp, unkind streaks across the walls. Beau closed his eyes, dragging in slow, measured breaths, but the memory clung to him, vivid and unrelenting.

The headlights. The ice. Isla’s voice, sharp with frustration. The sickening crunch of metal on metal.

She used to laugh so easily, he thought. He couldn’t remember the sound anymore—not the way it used to be, bright and carefree, bubbling out of her like sunlight on water. But in his dreams—his nightmares—it was her anger, her frustration, that always rang loud and clear.

The guilt weighed heavy in his chest, an ache that never quite left. It wasn’t just that he had been driving. It was that they had been fighting, stupidly, over nothing that mattered now. It was that he hadn’t seen the ice in time. It was that he had walked away from the wreck when she hadn’t.

How many times had he replayed the moment in his mind? Wondering if it could’ve gone differently, if there had been a single choice, a single second that might have changed everything? The thought haunted him, circling endlessly.

He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, willing the images to fade. It didn’t work. It never worked.

Beau swung his legs over the side of the bed, his feet hitting the floor with a dull thud. His hands trembled slightly as he pushed himself up and made his way to the kitchen. The hum of the fridge was the only sound in the too-quiet apartment. He grabbed a bottle of water, the cool condensation slick against his palm, and leaned heavily against the counter.

The same dream. The same memories. It always came back to that night.

The bottle felt cold in his hands, grounding him, but it wasn’t enough to shake the weight pressing down on him. His eyes drifted to the window, the city outside alive with movement—cars honking in the distance, muffled voices rising from the street below. It felt so far away, like it belonged to a world he didn’t quite live in anymore.

Turning away, Beau walked back to the small desk in the corner of the living room. His laptop was still open, the screen glowing faintly. He tapped the trackpad to wake it, the email staring back at him.

We’re excited to offer you the position…

The words blurred as he read them again. It was a chance—a fresh start, far away from the memories that clung to him no matter how hard he tried to shake them. But getting to L.A. was another story. The money in his bank account wouldn’t cover half of what he needed to relocate.

Sierra’s voice pushed its way back into his thoughts, insistent and nagging. “You should sell it, Beau. That house is just sitting there. It’s not like you’re ever going to use it.”

She wasn’t wrong, and that was what stung the most. Selling the house made sense. It was the quickest way to get the money he needed, to make the move, to take the job. But it wasn’t the house he dreaded—it was the memories waiting for him in Stonehaven. The place they had first met as teenagers. The place they had been together for the last time.

He thought of those two summers in Stonehaven, stuck at his grandfather’s house because his mom had been worried about him. She thought small-town life might straighten him out, keep him out of trouble long enough to make it to graduation. He had been so angry back then—angry at her, angry at the world, angry at being sent to that nowhere town where he didn’t know anyone and didn’t care to.

Except for Isla.

She had been the one bright spot in those long, tedious summers. The daughter of the nurse who came by a couple of times a week to check on his grandfather, Isla had shown up one day with her quick smile and curious eyes, asking him questions he hadn’t wanted to answer. But somehow, she’d gotten under his skin. Slowly, they’d gone from awkward small talk to spending entire days together. By the end of that first summer, they were inseparable.

They’d fallen hard, the kind of love that felt bigger than the both of them, like it could defy the world. When it came time to choose colleges, they had picked the same one in Chicago without hesitation. It hadn’t been easy—new city, new pressures—but they’d had each other.

And then winter break came. They’d gone back to Stonehaven to visit her family. He could still see her smile when they’d pulled into town, the way her eyes lit up excited to show her family her engagement ring.

But the memory always stopped there, hitting a wall he couldn’t get past without everything unraveling. The accident had erased all the good that came before it, leaving only fragments of what they had been. 

That town held pieces of his life that felt frozen in time, untouched by everything that had happened since. 

Still, he didn’t have a choice. The house wasn’t doing him any good sitting there, empty and rotting. It was just another piece of the past he couldn’t afford to hold onto.

His eyes dropped back to the email, the job offer staring back at him like a lifeline. If he sold the house, he could move forward. He could finally take the next step, leave everything that happened behind him, and focus on something—anything—that wasn’t tied to that night.

He pulled up a browser and typed: bus ticket to Stonehaven, Vermont.

The results loaded quickly, but he didn’t move for a moment, his hand hovering over the mouse. Selling the house was logical. Practical. It was just a house. But as he clicked to finalize the ticket, a knot of dread settled in his stomach.

It wasn’t the house he feared. It wasn’t even Stonehaven. It was himself—the memories he couldn’t escape and the guilt that followed him, relentless and unyielding.

He exhaled slowly, closing the laptop. This was the only way forward. He’d sell the house, take the job, and leave it all behind. One last trip to Stonehaven, and he’d finally be free.",1,1737865952.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

I just noticed today he was acting weird and not texting a lot. He asked for a picture of my new hair but didn't compliment me. Starting to sound a lot like my ex.

So I just told him I was curious what he thought about our date and he said he had a good day. So I asked him if he thought this was going anywhere and he said I am an interesting person and he got along well with me and could see us being good friends.

So I said well you kissed me so I just kinda want to know if we're on the same page. He said as far as relationship goes he wants something long term and I said me too and he said now he's just trying to expand his social life. I mean the way I take it is he just wants to be friends so I said well I just don't want to get the wrong idea if we're two friends hanging out or two people getting to know each other and seeing if they are compatible. We are supposed to hang out again for my birthday and then he's supposed to support me for a local poetry reading at the coffee shop in two weeks. He lives around an hour away.

Even the members who voted for him are now getting this increasing sense of despair from all the antics he's been pulling. My aunt was voicing her regrets in voting for him now that all federal workers have to go back to their office jobs (which she said makes it harder for her, since she's a registered nurse and doesn't hear her patients on the phone calls in the office with the other coworkers).

My brother also was telling me how scared he was for how this country was going. It felt comforting talking to him because most of my family is super insufferable with their politics. We were talking about the Silk Road, trump coin, and H-1b Visas and how the cost of living most likely won't be the same. I think what really sealed it for me was hearing a Youtuber I watch say that Germans have been posting that America needs to get it together because we're going down a slippery slope with trying to find a group of people to blame. I'm trying not to be a doomer, but it's getting to me.

I tell her all the time that he's a loser who preaches family values and is a deadbeat dad with 3 different baby mamas. It's scary that someone as socially slow as him is able to have so much influence on people, but idk maybe people are waking up more to it. I would like to hope.

On the bright side at least, I have a boyfriend now and he's been extremely comforting about this whole situation with me.

So. Our shuttle driver has a daily task of taking our restaurant staff home (I won’t give too many details as I’m sure it’s super unique to my hotel). The restaurant closed a little early because it was slow, so the waiter is waiting (lol) for the chef and the shuttle driver to finish up their side work. 

The chef comes out and asks me to unlock the van so he can wait inside. I do so, and he climbs in. The waiter is sitting in the back hallway, and the shuttle driver is nearby in the meeting room. I go to give the keys to the driver, who collects the waiter on his way out. Everyone was in the van, but it didn’t move. 

About 10 minutes later, the driver came back in, which I thought was odd, because it takes twice as long to get to their house and back. Driver went to get a cup of coffee and said he was waiting on the chef to get in the van. 

{insert question mark noises}

I’ve been wrong before, but I’m pretty confident that the chef is already in the van, so I convey this to the driver. He also makes question mark noises, goes back to the van, then pulls off seconds later.

Earlier today, I went to a Catholic parish in another part of town I don’t usually go through. I was in between errands and decided praying in the chapel was a better use of my time than doomscrolling on my phone. When I got to the first set of doors around 10am, they were locked so I went to the next set of doors and got the same result. There was a buzzer on the wall with a camera so I pressed the button and a woman answered. I was polite and told her I’d like to use the chapel. She said the person in charge of key access to the church wasn’t available on Saturdays (I didn’t bother asking why *she* couldn’t just do that for me). The woman told me to come back on Monday during normal office hours if I wanted a key for regular access. I said goodbye and thanked her for her time.

There was another chapel a few blocks down operated by the same parish. It’s connected to the school so I didn’t expect entry and sure enough it was locked and no one was inside. I still had a lot of time to kill so I just bought a coffee and did some shopping in the meantime, saying a few prayers but otherwise I felt annoyed.

Maybe they had issues in the past with unwanted strangers entering especially at night, but no access to the chapel at all on a Saturday during normal hours? Is that pretty common in certain areas or are they a little paranoid?",1,1737865568.0,AskAPriest,0,0.6,False

Your Ultimate Guide in 2025,"What is mocha coffee?” is one of the most common questions espresso lovers have when it comes to their favorite drink. Mocha Coffee: A rich and decadent drink that brings together the bold flavors of chocolate and coffee. For those after indulgent coffee, be it seasonal, year round or whatever the occasion may hold, this classic medley blends espresso with chocolate and hot-milk (sometimes whipped cream) for a heavenly brew.  
  
Mocha is a wonderful and indulgent combination of chocolate and coffee. A favorite for coffee aficionados, this indulgent blend strikes the perfect balance between sweet and bold coffee flavor.

1. Espresso: Mocha Coffee all begins with espresso (aka liquid courage) to lay down that strong foundation for your mocha. The bold, aromatic shot of espresso is the base while the flavoring and milk add variety.  2. Mocha: A mocha coffee is defined by chocolate. Chocolate espresso is usually a rich and sweet chocolate flavor that comes from mixing the fresh pulling shot with either or both: Chocolate syrup (when more sweetness desired) cocoa powder It serves as a layer of richness to the drink which complements well with that hint of coffee.  3. Steamed Milk :Steaming milk for an espresso-chocolate is essential to make the mixture velvety and softens out all the flavors. The milk softens the bitterness of espresso and chocolate.  4. A dollop of Whipped Cream (Optional): Some mocha coffee variations ask for a glob of whipped cream to top-off this treat with just that little bit more. They have a perfect, airy freshness that makes the cocktail an even more delicious and deluxe drink.  Espresso, chocolate and steamed milk topped with whipped cream together react in a complementary harmony of flavors making mocha coffee an all time favorite drink for the ones seeking attractive yet warm taste components.

# Different variations of mocha coffee include:



It is truly a trip worth taking for any coffee enthusiast to discover how they can personalize the mocha with their favorite add-ons and variations, as well as put their unique signature on distinctive cafe-staples. The following are certain detailed ways to spice up and customize mocha coffee as per your specific needs.



1. **Customizable Flavors:** When it comes to customizing your own mocha coffee, one of the most important abilities at our disposal is striking that perfect balance between chewy chocolate and bold espresso notes. If you want a stronger coffee flavour, adding instead a double shot of espresso will increase the strength yet more. On the flip side, more chocolate syrup or cocoa powder will make an even sweeter and richer mocha.

1. **Type of milk**: In a mocha coffee, you can change the type of milk that is served to be what you prefer. Mochas normally use cream or whole milk, which is why they are thick and creamy. However, you can go for almond, oat, or coconut alternative creams too!

1. **Add Flavor Enhancements:** You can experiment with adding some flavorings to a regular mocha coffee. Using vanilla extract, a tiny bit of cinnamon, or a hint of peppermint extract could give the drink much needed flavors and scents.

1. **Toppings and Garnishes** : Topping a mocha coffee with some added layer of chocolate coating can be a trencher or garnish. You can always make it look prettier by adding a dollop of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or topping it all off with a caramel drizzle and sea salt.
2. **Iced Mocha in the Spring and** **Summer:** Finally, when it is warmer out, you may opt for an iced mocha to drink. Just make a mocha coffee as you usually would, wait until it is cool, and pour over ice. To make it even more fun, throw in a few ice cubes and blend to get a frozen mocha frappe.

1. **Healthier Alternative:** Try to make a mocha coffee healthier by using dark chocolate or sugar-free chocolate syrup and making sure there is less added sugar. Imagine indulging without any guilt and still tasting the full flavors of delicious mocha coffee.

1. **Spiced Mocha:** If you want to get a tad fancy, then whip up some spiced mocha. Add spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom for those warm and cozy flavors that take the classic mocha to another level.

Through all these varied forms of mocha mixed coffee, lovers can tailor a personal square cup for taste and preference needs befitting the health consciousness. Customizing your mocha coffee variety is an enjoyable way to appreciate the craft of making refreshments — whether you like a rich, indulgent mocha or something lighter and tastier — and simply get exactly what speaks to you each time.

1ia5s6s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ia5s6s,"After nearly 20 years, I upgraded my espresso equipment (new stuff in second pic)","For no real reason, other than I wanted to, I upgraded my espresso setup. Both the Gaggia Classic (2006 model) and the MDF (2001 model) performed flawlessly throughout. We used the MDF for both drip (Technivorm) and espresso/lattes. Adding it all up, i would guess I probably ground over 2000lbs of coffee with the little MDF and only had one broken part in all of those years. The Gaggia setup is heading to college with our son - he is thrilled. 

The new stuff…Profitec Drive and Mazzer Philos. Still working all of the kinks out but the equipment is very nice. Hopefully it will perform for 20 years too with as few of problems. I don’t have the most discerning palate so I can’t say I can see a lot of difference in the coffee/espresso but the double boiler makes for a quicker brew session as well as the grinder is quicker too.

So, me and my mom went to The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf (CBTL) to cool down a bit after a kalesh we had at home (hum dono ke beech mai hi lmao). What was amazing was that we tried their Nutty Hot chocolate drinks, hot and iced and it was good. The hot chocolate was more hot chocolatey while the iced one was more hazelnutty. Another thing which I personally liked was their amazing music choice! Vibes match hogyi acchi khaasi 🥰 

Another thing, which is a sort of a funny experience is how these small girls got such an amazing deal from us. So what basically happened was while we were having our drinks, these 2 teenage (probably 8th or 9th graders) came up to us and told us ki they are putting up their stall and we should visit them. When we visited, I checked out their products (and gor these amazing phone charms) and like….my mum literally bought 1200 ka candles from them! In total, we gave them a sale of 2000. These charms we’re overpriced (150-200 ki range mai) but like…baccho se kya hi bargain krte lol. My mom did it all, just in the name of “motivating them”.
