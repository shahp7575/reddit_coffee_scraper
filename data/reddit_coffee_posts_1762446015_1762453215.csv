When I went inside they were preparing for the service. Me and my dad sat at the back, and shortly before starting a man walked up to us. He explained some stuff about the church that we might need to know as newcomers and gave us the opportunity to ask questions. I commented on the stained-glass windows at the back by the altar. He allowed me to come closer and explained a bit about them. One of the windows was brought back to the USA from a French church during World War II. The other one he told me about was commissioned by a local industrialist a few decades ago. The church was small and felt cozy. There weren’t many people, but I think it helped ease the stress. There was a nice man behind us who’d help me and my father if we ever lost track and provided us with any papers we might’ve missed (such as the service schedule since we accidentally grabbed the wrong one 😅). I really enjoyed the structure of the service. It’s a nice change from the megachurch I grew up in and reminded me and my father of a Catholic mass (neither of us are Catholic, but the last church we visited was a Catholic church so it was easy to notice the similarities). When the service was over they invited us for coffee hour, but I declined since we had limited time and neither me nor my father are a fan of coffee.
Overall, everyone there was welcoming and kind. This is probably one of the most welcoming churches I’ve ever been to in my town. I’m not Christian, but I’ve already asked one of my family members to take me again sometime!",1,1762453049.0,Episcopalian,0,1.0,False

A BL partner has agreed to a coffee with me next week because I worked with one of his siblings overseas. I'm a foreign lawyer here on a green card, taking the bar in Feb26 without the need to do an LLM. My experience overseas was mostly in niche government areas but in a common law country, and I was quite senior. I am aware cracking into any area of law, let alone BL, is an uphill battle for me, but this person is my only potential connection to the legal industry in nyc. 

From looking at the sub post history it seems coffee chats here are purely to make connections, and not sell yourself. I have already been upfront that the reason I reached out was to get help or tips on cracking into the legal market in this extremely competitive market (nyc), so I assume I dont raise it again when we meet  and I keep it informal? Also, how long does a coffee chat here usually go-  under 30 minutes given he's a partner? I'm the same age as the partner but basically ripped up my career when moving here for family, so I am sure we can chat family/age appropriate small talk for a while. Does this kind of stuff really help in the job hunt?  

Also, he knows I'm unemployed/studying for the bar  so I assume showing up in a tidier version of my normal outfit is acceptable ( jeans but smart sweater/coat/bag).

I’ve been digging into the digital marketing performance of five brands in the mushroom coffee/functional beverage space (MUD\\WTR, Foursigmatic, Odyssey Elixir, Taika, and Rebbl), and the results are fascinating. I thought this community would find the insights interesting and would love to hear your thoughts.

Here’s a quick rundown of what I found:

•The Market Leader's Paradox: MUD\\WTR is the clear leader with a massive 7.6 million annual visitors. But their purchase conversion rate is only 2.5%. For a brand with that much traffic, this seems incredibly low and suggests a huge opportunity for optimization.

•The Rise of the Underdogs: Two smaller brands, Odyssey Elixir and Rebbl, are growing their traffic at an impressive rate (33% and 32% YoY, respectively). However, their conversion rates are almost non-existent. They're getting people to their sites but not closing the deal.

•The Engagement Enigma: Rebbl has the lowest bounce rate of the group at 36%. This tells me their content is resonating with visitors, and people are sticking around. But again, no conversions. It's like having a busy store with no one buying anything.

•The Struggling Giants: Foursigmatic, a brand I thought was a major player, has seen its traffic decline by over 11%. And Taika has lost more than half its traffic in the last year.

It seems like the entire market is struggling with the same problem: converting traffic into customers. MUD\\WTR has built a powerful brand that gets people to their site, but they haven't perfected the art of selling once they're there.

What do you think is causing this massive conversion gap in the industry? Has anyone else seen this in their niche? What are the best strategies for a brand with high traffic but low conversion? I'm curious to hear your experiences and ideas.

I recently got hired at a coffee shop (orientation is tomorrow!) and I'm kind of freaking out. I know it's a fairly low pressure job, but starting any job is always the worst part, imo. Learning the recipes, meeting new people and learning their names, learning how the business works, not wanting to make any mistakes... it's a lot.

for some reason I feel like the window in the middle of the back wall is throwing me off, I have no idea how to make it feel balanced.

Ive thought about floating shelves on either side of the back wall, or potentially a gallery wall. -- and then selves on the right wall to store our coffee cups and clean up that buffet some. (which has to stay because the kitchen lacks so much storage already) -- would love to add curtains, but can't tell if it would be too much.

any help anyone is willing to give, or advice on how to even balance a dining room out like this, would be amazing and so so so appreciated. thank you!

Ahoy there, beautiful stranger.

If you’ve found yourself here, take a deep breath, settle in, and read on—I’m not the type to rush what could be the start of something truly special. 

I’m a 35-year-old switch male from Connecticut, seeking a genuine and lasting connection with a switch female in CT, MA, RI, or NY.

I’m not just looking for a fling or a quick fix. I’m looking for a woman who’s ready to be a true partner—someone who can match my laughter with her own, who loves the spark of chemistry but also values the deeper bond that comes from trust, honesty, and shared dreams.

I want a relationship where we can enjoy both the playful, passionate, and adventurous side of life and the softer, everyday moments—morning coffee together, holding hands on a walk, cuddling up on the couch while we game or read, and yes, plenty of heat and kink when the mood strikes.

💙 What I’m Looking For
• True Connection – built on emotional compatibility, shared passions, and a mutual willingness to invest in each other.

• Romance & Kink in Harmony – I want a relationship where the bedroom is a place of exploration and thrill, but the rest of our life together is equally fulfilling.

• Balance & Respect – While we’re together, I want to be your second priority—because your first priority should always be you: your dreams, your well-being, and your future. I’ll be doing the same for myself, because happiness starts within.

My philosophy of love is simple but deeply felt: Love is an offering, not a possession. When you care for someone, you don’t try to own them—you offer joy, comfort, and support, creating a space where they can thrive.

🌿 About Me
• Switch with Range – I’m comfortable and confident in both Dominant and Submissive roles, and I thrive on the natural flow of power exchange that comes from genuine compatibility.

• Dominant Side – Daddy, Wolf, Pet Handler, Master, Primal, and a bit of Sadist.

• Submissive Side – Pup, Little, and curious to explore more facets with the right partner.

• Personality – I’m loyal, protective, a little cheeky at times, and I like to keep things light and fun whenever I can. I’m a natural caretaker in relationships—whether that’s bringing you soup when you’re sick, making you laugh when you’ve had a rough day, or holding you close when words aren’t enough.

• Interests & Hobbies:
• Gaming – PC gaming, Dungeons & Dragons (3.5 & 5e), and fantasy worlds you can get lost in.

• Reading – Legend of Drizzt, Mistborn, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Eragon, A Song of Ice and Fire, Harry Potter, and anything that stirs the imagination.

• Outdoors – Hiking through forests, bonfires under the stars, nature walks with good company.

• Animals – I adore animals and share my home with a yellow-belly slider turtle named Tokka and a mischievous cat named Munch.

• Communication Style – I believe that relationships thrive when both people are heard, valued, and respected. I’m a better talker than texter, but I’ll always make time for a good, engaging conversation.

🔥 Kinks & Play
I’m open-minded, passionate, and believe that kink should be fun, consensual, and safe. Some of my favorites include:

Pet play, primal play, switching, Mommy Dom/Little boy, Daddy Dom/Little girl, impact play, kissing, spanking, wolf play, roleplay, power exchange, lactation, collars, biting, clawing, butt plug tails, breastfeeding, age play, and aftercare.

With the right person, I’m always excited to discover new interests and explore your fantasies too.

❌ Hard Limits & Boundaries

• No hard-partying or daily heavy drinking.

• Not into BBW; preference for partners under 200 lbs and height-to-weight proportional.

• No hate, but I’m not seeking a trans partner.

• No Poly

• Please do not message me if you live in NYC, Long Island, Boston. Traveling to those places are a pain.

• Age Gap pluse or minus 10 years so 25-45 only.

• I am not a kink dispenser. Don't treat me as such.

💌 Let’s Make the First Move Count
If you’ve read all of this, start your message with:

""What music you’ve been jamming to lately""—and tell me a little about yourself: your age, location, and what you’re truly seeking in a romantic relationship.

I’m looking for more than just a partner—I’m looking for a co-adventurer, a partner-in-crime, a confidant, and yes… someone I can shamelessly flirt with and maybe drive a little wild when the mood hits.

So, if you’re ready for a connection that blends passion, romance, laughter, and genuine care… maybe it’s time to see if we can unlock each other’s next chapter.

i’ve worked with enough multi-site teams to see the same thing happen over and over again. HQ sends an “urgent” update… and it either lands 2 days late or not at all.

so here’s what i’ve seen actually help:

**DO:**

* build a 2-minute “shift brief” into the day. doesn’t have to be fancy. just talk. people pay attention when it comes from their manager, not a screen.
* use that 2 minutes to appreciate something someone did yesterday. make it feel like more than just “what went wrong.”
* keep updates short. like, one thing at a time. nobody’s scrolling through a wall of text before a busy shift.
* let folks ask dumb questions in the moment. that’s how it sticks.

**DON’T:**

* rely on reminders, pings, or “acknowledge” buttons. people just tap them to make the noise stop.
* drop updates mid-day and expect miracles. no one’s refreshing their work app while making coffee orders.
* assume “read = understood.” most of the time, they’re just being polite.

Apparently, Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is going to replace traditional SEO by 2029.

The gist is that instead of just trying to rank high on Google with keywords, local businesses will need to be optimized so AI (like ChatGPT or Google's AI Overviews) can directly recommend them as THE answer to a user's question. Think about it, instead of getting a list of links for 'best coffee shop near me,' you'll just get one direct recommendation from the AI.

What's really interesting is that traffic from AI recommendations converts up to 5 times higher than regular Google searches. So if you're a local business owner, getting picked by the AI is going to be HUGE for getting new customers.

The article breaks down some ways to do this, like making sure your Bing Places listing is perfect (since ChatGPT often uses Bing data), using structured data (that's the technical stuff that helps AI understand your business), and having really clear, concise answers to common questions on your website. They even mentioned a coffee shop that used a ChatGPT chatbot to figure out what customers preferred, then optimized their content based on that.

They had a case study about a car detailing place in Miami that got recommended by ChatGPT when someone asked for the 'best car detailers.' 

It sounds like if local businesses don't get on this AEO train soon, they're going to be left behind because AI is going to totally change how people find things locally. The article even has a section predicting what AI search will look like by 2029, and it's pretty wild to think about.

Has anyone else heard about this or started thinking about how their local businesses (or businesses they support) might need to change for AI? I'm curious if this feels as urgent to others as it does to me after reading this.",1,1762452558.0,SEO,0,1.0,False

So I really wanted to make cookies last weekend with some cannabis buds I got, bought some premade dry chocolate chip cookie mix and started making another batch of cannibutter since theast one went moldy (I didn't store it right). it was around a cup or so of butter I made it with since I had the intention of having some left over for other edibles in the future 

While waiting, I prepared the cookie dough and added the egg, some instant coffee and reeses pieces for flavor,noticed it was weirdly dry after so I thought that was weird. Later after the 🌿 butter was done I let it cool in the fridge, eventually using the freezer because it wasn't cooling fast enough (the recipe called for softened butter but not melted), and then added a half a cup which the recipe called for. I was assuming it was fine because it still had enough butter, even if the thc is in there.

The dough still wasn't binding together though and my hand was getting pretty sore from trying to mix it, and it was like the mix ate up my butter without any changes to the appearance, and I was extremely reluctant to added another half a cup of butter since I already lost a stick earlier that day so that was when I probably commited my crime , I added a half a cup of water

Now obviously, the  batter mix got extremely wet and wasn't binding and I decided to so something stupid again, and tried baking it anyway (at 350⁰ F) hoping it would just fix itself in the oven somehow, it covered nearly the entire pan and I ended up using a pizza tray because I had left over batter, I swear I was totally sober during this part, I'm just stupid.

Somehow the cookies turned out fine once I broke it apart and they cooles down, They tasted pretty good and I still got stoned for the night 🌿. 

But now they are really big chunks of cookie and kinda stiff, and I wanted like, actual cookies, is there something I can do to reutilize them? Like break them up and add to something else? I would like suggestions.

Tldr: tried making weed cookies and added water to the batter when it wasn't mixing with the weed butter correctly, (the base recipe called for half a  stick of softened butter and one egg, with no mentions of increasing the egg or butter amount for different batch sizes)",0,1762452404.0,smosh,0,0.25,False
1oq660h,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1oq660h/quitting_caffeine_after_over_20_years/,Quitting caffeine after over 20 years,"Currently 3 weeks caffeine free after years of addiction and dependence.

It started with drinking 1-2 teas a day as a teen and got worse at uni when working in a bar I would have 4-6 energy drinks a day, specifically monster or relentless in my early 20s.
This progressed to the point it actually made me impotent and would have a blinding migraine if I didn't drink one within minutes if waking up.
After advice from my doctor as a suggestion as he didn't think that would change anything, I went cold turkey on the energy drinks and leaned on tea to keep me going, symptoms went away very quickly and thought maybe that's just energy drinks, so steered clear ever since.

Then around 8 years ago I discovered coffee, oh, sweet sweet nectar of the gods where had you been all my life?
Started on instant sachets and worked my way up to a mokka pot which had about 6 shots per pot, I'd have two of those a day and would positively vibrate, existed this way for years with seemingly no issues, I never slept well but thought maybe that's just who I am! 

Then the panic attacks and anxiety started around 3 years ago, so bad I've been to a&e over them a few times as I thought I was dying.
I've always had anxiety but this became chronic, I put this down to my wife being pregnant with our first born at the time, new responsibility and fear of the unknown etc. 
So I ploughed along on the coffee train, reduced my intake a little to 4-6 shots a day, eventually 3 shots and that was that (after the first 6 months of sleepless nights with a baby) 

Wife is now pregnant with baby two and now a new symptom came along the last 6 months, reflux/heartburn chronically, doctor suspected GERD so took PPIs the last 6 months but I'd still suffer with bloating, constant anxiety, shortness of breath, chest pain, reflux etc. 

I came off the tablets a month ago, and randomly came across someone talking about coffee being acidic and caffeine relaxing your esophageal sphincter making reflux much worse, and stopping it could fix the issue. 
I made the decision to go completely cold turkey 3 weeks ago as a temporary experiment to see if it helped the reflux, with the intention of coming back to it after a short haitus.

Wow, the first 2 weeks have been hell on earth! The migraines, the low energy, the fatigue, the lack of concentration, brain fog.
Felt very irratable and not myself, dealing with a toddler and a full time job that requires high accuracy was almost too much to take, but I've soldiered on, drinking lots of water, trying to eat well in the hopes it gets better.
Now week 3 my energy has leveled out, there's no crashes, all other symptoms have reduced, I'm sleeping between 7-8 hours a day and have been a 5-6 hour sleeper as long as I can remember!

Reflux has reduced a lot, I'm only 3 weeks in but by far, the biggest change has been anxiety.
This has reduced by around 80-90% and that was within days, I didn't even know I could feel this calm, it was like my nervous system was always on fire, I just to sit freaking out sometimes not knowing why.
I knew caffeine could increase anxiety but never to that level, I guess my body just doesn't suit it anymore.
And for that reason alone, I don't think I'll ever come back to it, I don't like who I am on it and I'm finally starting to feel normal. 

The weirdest adjustment is feeling an energy rush from food, I've relied on that from coffee for so long my brain just didn't register sustenance as energy😂

Discovered this subreddit in the depths of my caffeine withdrawal and it's been so nice reading others experiences that I'm not alone in this journey and many have been through the same process.
It's scary that multiple trips to the doctor for both anxiety and reflux and not once has any doctor said ""out of interest what's your caffeine intake like?"" I wonder how many people are suffering without realizing there could be a route cause, but caffeine is so ingrained into our culture, many of my work friends think I'm crazy to stop and how could I survive without it, 3 weeks without and many testimonies on here proves I can!

I have been to Costa Rica twice before and want to see something newer, but I’ll be traveling with 3 others who have never been.
My first time I was quite young and went on a tour with EF, times in each place were quite short, and we were all over but I LOVED the integration of all of the experiences with locals.
Second time, I went for just under a week and spent it all in Guanacaste at a resort (which I kind of regret, I wish I’d seen more of the country). This time, I want to strike a healthy balance. 
This trip is going to be planned in the summer.

My current plan is:
Day 1: Land in San Jose around noon. We have that evening/ afternoon to walk around town, see local merchants, and I’m planning on eating at Sikwa that night, and then we stay the night in San Jose. (We are considering staying at ALMA glamping, but maybe we want to stay more city center? Or closer to our morning hike?)

Day 2: wake up in San Jose, do Hacienda La Chimba hike. Bucket list item for everyone on the trip. Then, road trip down to Manuel Antonio. We hopefully will get to the hotel in the afternoon, and maybe stop on the drive there for lunch or get it in San Jose. I saw that there’s a dinner and night-time mangroves boat tour that we would do that night. Not sure of hotel.

Day 3: beach day to recover from travel, or we will maybe kayak in the ocean/ mangroves.

Day 4: exploring the national forest of Manuel Antonio, and have a local food/ coffee/ chocolate experience? Unsure about this and don’t know if I’m packing this too full, but we want to be able to experience local customs and culture.

Day 5: Drive to Monteverde/ La fortuna area. We have heard good things about Amor Arenal, so we are thinking of wrapping up our trip staying there. Check into hotel, lounge around, probably eating dinner in town or at the hotel depending on our energy levels 

Day 6: rafting or zip lining, or some kind of excursion that does some combination.

Day 7: super torn here, would love to go on some hikes and see beautiful wildlife/ scenery. Maybe Rio Celeste or Hanging bridges

Day 8: stay at the resort, get massages, have some time in some hot springs and recover so that we feel refreshed coming back home.

Day 9: drive to San Jose airport and fly home.",1,1762452289.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1oq64ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearfulAvoidants/comments/1oq64ns/is_it_over_with_her_is_she_a_fa/,Is it over with her? is she a FA?,"I saw her earlier this year, it could have been in February or March.  I thought she was interesting but we didn't really speak. 

Then, a month ago I went to this language exchange event and near the end of it, there she was, this time around I enganged in conversation quickly. ""Would you like and drink a juice somewhere else?""   she immediately accepted.  It was early at night, we drank our juice and then she offered to drive me home.  This was on Tuesday September 30th.   

A couple of days later she sends me a text, inviting me to go to a salsa event together but then she realised she was still recovering from an injury and wanted instead to and grab a coffee and a light meal.  On Saturday 4th of last month we went for it,  I grabbed her hand which she immediately liked, while we were sitting down she asked me... ""So I wasn't sure before if you wanted to help me with English or if this connection that I feel between us is real, but now I see that it is""  She told me that she could not offer me a stable relationship right now because many things are happening in her life, but that we could explore our attraction. She also told me that she hated depending on others or that they would depend on her, because she has been exploited this way in the past.  We made out that night.  

Two days later by phone call she told me that I had ""shook her ground"" and that all of this was very intense.  That recently she had ended her LDR and was feeling very confused about all of this, but still she wanted to continue.  We continued for a week,  our intellectual conversations were really interesting, and whenever we met in person we would hold hangs, we went to the cinema, and had a very intense mutual attraction.  Then she told me that she still was speaking to her LDR sometimes, but that the relationship was going nowhere.  Upon listening to this I decided to tell her on a polite message that I was stepping aside for the time being, that I thought it was the best.  That night she called me, we spoke about different things, she said that she perfectly understood this, that she wished me the best and the she was going to miss me, she cried.  Days later we reconnected, I was missing her very much and she still had her feelings intact for me.  We met,  and arranged going to a hotel for the weekend.  

We had arranged to pay the hotel 50-50, upon arriving there I paid thinking we would sort out the money later.  The night we spent was very beautiful, it felt extraordinary and also very tender, extremely cute in every way.  Upon saying good bye that day she reminded me about her part of paying, so I accepted and she gave the money.  By the evening, she was acting very differently. 

During the weekend we did not speak. On Monday she reopened the conversation but was speaking in a very cold way so I called her. It ended up being that she had felt that charging her had made the whole encounter rather transactional. That she hadn't liked it and that she had decided to focus on her teenage kids instead, and since she had recently returned to the city after many years this implied living for the time being with her ex husband but that she didn't have anything with him and that at the first sight of him trying to go back with her she would run away.  That until then she had been staying at some friends,  and that it wasn't because of me that she took this decision, but that seeing that failure in our connection gave her the last impulse to focus on the relationship with her kids. Our phone conversations were still warm, still tender.  Last Sunday we met in person and that's when she told me that her childhood had been difficult with a distant mother,  that living with her father had made her good at doing business (she works at a big corporation)  but also to have problems connecting with her feelings and that most part of her adult life has been about being able to reconnect with them. It was a very passionate encounter.  Before saying good bye she cried and told me that she was feeling in love with me.  I told her that I felt the same  (by the way that evening I gave her some sun flowers).     
  
\*Our conversation part is also very important, as we speak a lot about psychology.  She has taken many workshops to improve emotionally. 

  
During Monday she told me that she had been thinking about what I told her.  During the evening we had a voice call,  she expressed happiness that I was in love with her because it is mutual, but also sadness because she doesn't want to hurt me and since she cannot offer a relationship in this moment, this was a problem.  I told her that real relationships are built over time, she agreed me and told me that I'm very mature for my age, etc.    She's 45 and I'm 36.  What I found weird is that after this conversation she disabled the ""last time seen online whatsapp function""

On Tuesday morning I wished her a good morning and she reacted with a heart emoji.  During the evening I sent her a message ""hope you enjoyed your day""   she replied with a bear with hearts emoji, thanked me and also asked how my day had been.   Then I said it had been a day of much progress, and I asked  ""how are your honey eyes tonight?""  (an inside joke between us)  she read it about two hours later but chose not to reply. 

  
This was two days ago and there's no news from her.  I know that she's planning a weekend to another city for this weekend along with one of her kids.  But that's all.

Was my reply that bad?   how can she say on Monday evening that she is in love and then complete detachment?  

  
Please someone help me understand. I feel like messaging her but I don't know if it is the correct thing to do.",1,1762452277.0,FearfulAvoidants,0,1.0,False

	•	What style of furniture fits this look without it being too overdone
	•	Good lighting and decor ideas to make it feel warm and creative but not cluttered
	•	Any plants, rugs, or wall art recommendations that really complete the look

A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through the r/Nagpur subreddit late at night. I don’t even remember what post it was something casual about cafes or weekend plans. Then I saw her comment. It wasn’t even something extraordinary, but there was this mix of wit, warmth, and confidence that caught my eye instantly.

On impulse, I checked her profile and, without overthinking, I sent her a DM. I didn’t expect a reply, honestly but she replied.

That first conversation went on for hours. You know when you talk to someone and it just flows? No awkward pauses, no pretending  just pure connection. It was like we had known each other for years but somehow missed each other in every lifetime before this one.

Fast-forward a few days, we decided to meet at a cafe on wardha road (I was nervous as hell). She walked in, and I swear the world paused for a second. She was even more beautiful in person but it wasn’t just that. It was her energy, the way she smiled, the way her eyes lit up when she talked.

We talked for hours that day. Same taste in music, same weird humor, same love for coffee and late-night drives. Even the way she looked at the world it matched mine perfectly. It wasn’t just attraction; it felt like finding the other half of a thought I’d never been able to complete.

Since that day, we’ve met a few more times. Every time feels like the first exciting, effortless, and peaceful at the same time. I don’t know where this is going yet, but for the first time in a long time, it feels like something real, something rare.

Reddit usually brings memes, debates, and random chaos into my life but this time, it brought me her.

This is also VERY long winded with LOTS of context. You’ve been warned.

I (F20) got into a relationship with M (M23) about a year ago. I absolutely love him, he’s been the best boyfriend I’ve ever had, we just click well, we’ve been living together for six months and we’ve hardly ever argued, we are able to support each others personal issues and really help each other. He has a fantastic job, and has been able to support us very well since I lost my job at the beginning of October. He’s incredibly stable, and I know he’s my right choice, there’s so much potential to build a great life together and I intend on doing my part to make sure that happens. The bad decisions here involve K (M21). K was one of my oldest friends. We met when I was 16, and we immediately clicked and understood each other that’s so incredibly rare, we understood each other in a way that is so comforting to have a friend who feels that way. We had a brief  “relationship” (it was three months long, we got to see each other a total of like, maybe 6 times? That entire time because he lived an hour away and we were both minors, who had to deal with school, curfews, etc etc.) that relationship didn’t end well at all, and he admitted openly that he really fucked up and should have put as much effort into it as I had. His actions, and the fall of our relationship, led to me hating him for three years. During those three years, he’d try to reconnect every single year around the same time. It always went like this 1.) message with a “Hey, how are you?” 2.) quick recap of the last year 3.) telling me he decided to message me after hearing a sad country song that reminded him of me (enter some sort of sad country song about how the singer mourned the loss of the one who got away) 4.) me lashing out and using him as an emotional punching bag and him just weathering it until one of us burnt out of the emotional ability to be apart of such a toxic loop. This last summer, however, I had been able to go through some therapy, and actually sit down and actually work through all of the shitty emotions. I was actually able to take his apologies, accept them, and forgive him for his actions. This is rare, but he too had actually been able to genuinely understand how much he had hurt me and wanted to make it right again. After we did the uncomfortable job of sitting down together and working through all of the trauma and emotions we had caused to each other and with each other, we both came to the conclusion that teenage hormones are wack and we’d always been better off as friends. We began again, an uneasy friendship that eventually made it back to him being my closest friend and confident, considering he was also technically my oldest friend, and genuinely knew me better than almost anyone. I had been in a relationship with M at this point for a while, and I had placed boundaries in order to be respectful of my current relationship. He was incredibly respectful of those, as was I.

M and I also had an agreement that friendships with the other gender where completely fine, as long as we where both communicative and listened if the other partner had issues. He had a female best friend, J (F24), that had been around before me, and was HIS closest, and oldest friend. I respected that, and didn’t feel a need to monitor that friendship, because I trusted M completely. Eventually J started doing things I wasn’t comfortable with, and every time an incident happened, I would bring it up to M, and ask him to handle it as he saw fit. These incidents escalated into the story I’m about to detail.

At the beginning of October, I was INCREDIBLY sick. I was coughing up blood, blacking out, etc etc. I was also taking care of my parents house at the time, and trying to stay away from M as much as I possible because he is immunocompromised and I didn’t want him getting as sick as I was or worse. Which means that him and I were in two separate locations on a weekend. He understood that he was the one I was depending on at that point, because my parents were out of town. If I needed medication from town or something along the lines, I’d call him because I wasn’t in any condition to drive. I left him alone all day, because I didn’t need anything, but I also wanted him to enjoy his weekend and do as he will without worrying about me. I knew he was out hanging out with one of his guy friends, working on his truck. That’s all I knew. Around 9 pm I needed meds from town, so I called M, no answer. I checked his location, it said it was at home, so I called 4 more times. Also no answer. I, at this point became incredibly worried about him, so I called M and I’s roommate to go check on M. Our roommate told me M wasn’t home, but his truck was. I called his friends wife, to see if he had ended up at their home with his friend. M’s friend was there, he was not. So at this point, all I know is that M isn’t home, his phone is turned off, he’s not with who I thought he was, and I really needed medication before all the stores closed. I made the decision to drive myself to get this medication, and had to pull over twice in order to have coughing fits and spit blood out the window. I got myself my medication and drove home. I tried to call him a few more times because I was GENUINELY worried that he was dead in a ditch somewhere. After a few more hours, around midnight, he finally texts me. His phone was turned off because he had been at a corn maze with J. I was extremely upset because he felt the need to hide the fact he did that from me in two ways; He told me he was with his guy friend, and he felt the need to turn off his phone. At this point in our relationship, I knew in my bones he would never cheat on me, but I also knew that J was in some capacity jealous of me taking M away from her. I told him I was upset, and that I was going to bed. The next morning, he shows up to my parent’s house to apologize and explain. He tells me “oh no, it’s fine, it wasn’t just J and I, you’re ex (who I told M had quite literally HIT me, who was also friends with J, and M had decided he no longer wanted anything to do with, supposedly, up to this point) was there too!” And “I didn’t turn off my phone, it died, and I couldn’t charge it till I was home again” and “I didn’t even want to go, I was drunk from hanging out with guy friend all day. I was in bed about to go to sleep when they dragged me out of bed and forced me to go” At this time I’d like to state that my boyfriend, M, is six and a half feet tall and 300 pounds. There is NO WAY that if he really didn’t want out of bed, an out of shape 5’6 woman and a scrawny 5’11 dude could get him out of bed, let alone DRAG HIM THROUGH A CORN MAZE if he hadn’t wanted to go. But whatever, he turned the tears on and I was a sucker for it. I forgave him, and once I was better, went home with him again. Once I was at home, I found one of J’s press on nails on my side of the bed. I showed it to M, and started packing my things. Women don’t just “lose” those, especially in one of their platonic guy friends rooms. He told me that she had lost it while trying to drag him out of bed. That’s totally plausible, but I still needed time to think on everything so I spent two weeks sleeping on my parents couch. During those weeks, I confided in my closest friend, K, and he told me that if worst came to worst, I was welcome to his spare bedroom, and we’d figure out bills once I was on my feet again and had a job. I told him I very much appreciate his offer, and that if I did take him up on that, it would be a WHILE before doing so. I later told my sister about everything, including the offer from K. All of this was through text.

Eventually I decided that I’d try and give M another shot, even though my trust in him was very shaken, and I still wasn’t 100% sure he hadn’t cheated on me that night. I told M that because of that trust being eroded, I was no longer comfortable with him being friends with J any longer. He was upset about that, understandably, this woman was his longest friend, and that hurts to decide. After a while, and our relationship being back on more or less steady ground, we find ourselves running errands in K’s town and decide to stop by, more or less unannounced. M sees a condom on K’s end table, and is very upset by that, because he felt as if that condom had been “laid out” for me. Keep in mind K is a single man in his early 20’s. Of course the man is going to have condoms in his house that he doesn’t share with anyone. It’s not my business what his sexual habits are, but it’s fair to assume that he fucks 🤷🏻‍♀️. Whatever. Later M decides to go through my phone while I’m taking a nap, and looks at my sister and I’s chat to “see my side of things”. This was strange behavior, because throughout our ENTIRE relationship, though we’ve both had each other’s passwords and full access to each other’s phones, we’ve never felt the need to search each others phones, least of all behind the other’s back. He finds K’s offer of moving me into his spare room, and again, loses his shit. He asks me to stop talking to K. During this entire fiasco, I get the distinct feeling that he is reaching for straws, maybe even projecting on me a little? And him asking me to cut K out more or less felt like retribution for me asking him to cut J out. I agree, and I meet up for coffee, in a public place, with K to explain everything and give him something I had already promised to make for him. He understands, but we’re both very very bummed. We stop talking, but a week into it, I receive a call from K at about 8:30 at night. I’m afraid that something bad had happened, so I answered, and it turns out that he had bought a vintage 1200 dollar dirtbike that he wants to fix up, and needed my help diagnosing the issue and fixing it. For context, I am a certified Honda, Harley, and Polaris mechanic. I went to MMI Avondale for trade school. This clocked as VERY strange to me, because before we stopped talking, he had NEVER mentioned buying a dirtbike at all, and I feel like spending over a thousand dollars on something is definitely something that’s worth putting more than a weeks thought into, and probably worth mentioning to the person you’re expecting to help fix it. I tell him it was inappropriate to call me, that we had stopped talking out of respect to M and his wishes, but he had me on the call anyway, and to tell me what its issues where. I was more or less able to diagnose what the problem probably was, and walked him through how to disassemble and clean the problem issue. (Carburetor with old gummy gas, believe it or not 🙄)

Here’s where I fuck up. K found his in again, and we start talking again. Platonically, completely, behind M’s back. For about a week and a half. I feel gross about it the entire time, but that still didn’t stop me from doing the shitty thing and continue talking to K. It boiled down to last night, where he called me, told me he could no longer be friends with me respectfully, because he developed feelings for me, and that he had a girl over the night before, but he wanted to text me more than spend time with the girl, and he realized he was developing feelings for me once again, and that it’s not fair to M and I’s relationship, respectful to me for being friends with me under false pretenses, or respectful to these women that he is attempting to pursue a relationship with. I told him I completely understood, that I’ve been feeling really gross about us still being friends behind M’s back, and that I too had been kind of catching feelings for K too, and that’s not fair to anyone at all. We REALLY called it quits last night, hopefully, but now I feel really gross inside and kind of like a shitty person for letting it go that far. This is the end of my story, and as I was writing this, I began to understand more and more how MUCH of a shitty B movie situation this is. :( I fucked up and now I’m reaping the consequences of my own actions, but I just needed to get this out of my system in the most anonymous and least judgemental way possible.",2,1762452010.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

The only two victories the Las Vegas Raiders have so far this season have been at home, friends – and 4 of the 6 losses they’ve taken have been by at least 10 points. These two squads are moving in two completely different directions, and with the Broncos sitting at 7-2, I expect them to win by double digits at home against a struggling visitor (despite this being a divisional matchup). To be frank, I can’t imagine a universe where the Raiders find a way to break through the Broncos’ defense; give me Denver to cover.

What’s going on?","I’m (30M) visiting my sister in a city in another state for a month, and thought I’d have some fun swiping on the dating apps in a big city for the first time in years. I’m kinda bummed on dating and haven’t been single in a big pool of people for a long time, so I figured maybe something fun and casual might come around.

The very first date I went on threw me for a loop. We walked our dogs, got coffee, and that evening, met up for a concert and I ended up staying over at her place. Vibes were fantastic, we clicked, her house and dog are adorable, and she seemed really engaged with getting to know me. Then a day later, she said that she was still working through a hard breakup and didn’t want to continue things with me.

Okay, so I’ve been on many first dates, I’ve had quite a few rejections, but this one hit me like a breakup. I’m pining for her hard, trying to move on, replaying our conversations…I’m pretty messed up about it. It’s wild. I knew in that moment that a casual fling while I’m traveling is probably not for me. But where do I go with that knowledge?

Is it just because I’m a sensitive person and this was a particularly intense meetup? Or might this actually be something special? I’m at a position in my self-development where I’m letting my guard down a little bit and allowing myself to feel things more intensely and be less scared of commitment, fwiw. The thought even crossed my mind- “damn, I could see myself relocating for a woman this amazing.” 

For context, I’ve been single and very casually trying to make something happen for about a year now. This is the first real date I’ve had in that time.

So, has anyone else had similar feelings? A bit of a dating cynic who got their shit rocked and it turned them upside down a little? I feel like I need to reevaluate my life a little bit, and think about what my relationship priorities really are.

And lastly, I really do want to politely reach out and leave the door open for her, but I’m not sure if I should/how I should, to not be too imposing.",2,1762451573.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

It so started that it depended on them whether a plan will be executed or cancelled. And I was never told, which made me look like a fool. They did the same with another guy who was very good friends with me. 

Maybe men don’t react so much and but I was quite hurt. So i unfollowed them everywhere. Later when I had the talk with them and apologised and told them why i react strongly and shared some family trauma they said they understand, but things won’t become like before suddenly. I understood. But after that day they were disconnected, left me and went for tea/coffee. I use to greet them first always, call or msg to ask whether they are coming to office today… but they never reciprocated and instead gradually stopped talking. I was hurt and decided to stop running behind those people. 

I stopped going to office regularly and wfh. Now the situation is very awkward and I don’t want to keep them in my life or even contact list anymore as they just peek in my life but never even like my pics nor do they msg or call. I feel like people should be either fully in ur life even if u have ups and downs but should be willing to patch things or else should just leave you or ur life alone. 

But the last time I unfollowed and removed all, I was called overreactive and I had decided not to impulsively remove people like that. But now it’s becoming toxic, we all don’t even greet even if we are walking past each other.

1oq5q8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TenantsInTheUK/comments/1oq5q8q/landlord_dispute_unfair_treatment_and/,Landlord dispute - unfair treatment and non-compliance with deposit scheme,"We (myself, husband, 5yo and 2.5yo) moved into a rental in the North East in December 2023. Our monthly rent was £1500 and we paid £1500 as a deposit upon signing the tenancy agreement. At first, our landlord seemed like an ok guy, although this deteriorated over time. Nothing absolutely major but things like telling us we had to cover the bathroom floor in towels whenever the bath or shower was being used because actually sealing off the shower and bath would cause damage? So we ended up spending an extortionate amount on towels over the course of the tenancy and every time a tiny amount of water got onto the bathroom floor, it leaked through the lounge ceiling underneath and damaged our rug and was just a nuisance. Another time, he turned up to the property unannounced at 9am on a Saturday morning. There are 3 doors separating the lounge from the front door so we didn’t hear any knocking (TV on, kids being kids, us chatting, not expecting anyone) - he then proceeded to knock on and peer through both the lounge and kitchen windows, hugely unsettling as a heavily pregnant woman sat in her underwear. 

Anyway, as we approached the end of our tenancy, we decided for numerous reasons that we would seek another rental instead of continuing the current one. We made the landlord aware of this straight away (3 months prior to tenancy ending) and kept him in the loop the entire way. Eventually, we found somewhere we wanted to move and were accepted upon applying. We tried to get the new landlord to accept a later move in date closer to the end of our current tenancy but the property had been vacant for a while and he said he would rather find another tenant who could move in sooner if that was the case, this house is perfect for us right now so we didn’t want to lose the house and agreed to the date he proposed (01/11). Our tenancy was supposed to end 30/11. We kept the former landlord in the loop and asked him if we could come to a mutual agreement regarding November’s rent to which he got very nasty with us and flat out refused to negotiate. He had just recently been messaging us about the extremely high level of interest and how many viewings he wanted to line up etc. We proposed that we pay the period covering from 28th Oct - 15th Nov and told him that he can also keep our entire deposit with no issues from us about that. There were a few small things that needed done to the house such as 6 small holes filled where we had put a TV bracket up, a small coffee mark on the 3rd step etc but nothing that would amount to the entire deposit needing to be used. 

Anyway, after this, he became really aggressive and personal with us. He started searching for our new address, asking “Is this it? Do you want me to contact your new landlord?”, saying “(Area we live) is a small community, as you fine well know”, telling us we are incapable of running a home etc. I reminded him I was documenting all of these messages and to leave us alone. He told us we are breaching our contract (despite him previously agreeing to this), we should be ashamed of ourselves, he is not the one breaching obligations etc, he even tried telling us that we had to leave the property with immediate effect and sent repeated “Leave now” messages to us despite us reminding him that he had no legal standing to do this. 

We left on 01/11 and started receiving messages from him about paying for a professional cleaner, a chimney sweep, a window cleaner etc. He sent across photos claiming extensive damages, such as a photo of a fully wrapped chocolate coin resting underneath the radiator grate in the lounge - probably from my son given it was Halloween the night before we moved out - we also took our own photos just before vacating and the stairs are clean apart from the coffee mark mentioned earlier, but in his photo the bottom step has been caked in mud. I reminded him that we have given him the entire deposit and also reminded him that a chocolate coin in a radiator grate is not damage in any way shape or form. He flipped, again. This triggered me to start delving a bit deeper as I was confused about why he was acting so unreasonably and trying to get more out of us despite having £2250 all together to cover rent and ‘damages’. This led me to discovering that he had never protected our deposit back in 2023 and this is why he is obviously very annoyed about the situation - he has no deposit to access to cover anything because he has spent it instead of protecting it. I politely asked for more information regarding our deposit and the protection scheme that had been used and he promptly responded accusing me of harassment for contacting him about it. Obviously I followed up and have made him aware that we expect our full £1500 deposit back due to his disregard for his legal obligation as a landlord and because of his treatment of us since we decided to leave our tenancy. He has now said that he is not paying it back and that if we start court proceedings he will file a counter claim against us and that court is not beneficial to anyone. He said he can’t settle our dispute regarding the deposit until he has solid figures regarding remedial work costs.

Calling it #NOSPRESSO (tentatively)","So I made a post yesterday that garnered a bit more attention than I would've thought. But I received mostly positive feedback from everyone and it seems for the most part we have a decent consensus! I've already started my \[Spotify Boycott\](https://propcott.com/campaigns/boycott-spotify-for-promoting-ice-ads) , but I can try and initiate this one. I will need some extra help though.

Long story short to summarize, I’m proposing a focused targeted boycott that starts with Nespresso pods, with the option to include Starbucks branded Nespresso pods as a two in one (I'm sure ya'll are aware of Starbucks unethical practices as well)

The goal is practicality. Nespresso is a recurring, high margin purchase and there are credible, ethical viable alternatives that work with Nespresso OriginalLine machines. That makes behavior change simpler and the impact easier to track.

The simplicity matters. Think the recent Disney Plus boycott. One clear action of cancellation translated into a HUGE movement, where Disney actually had to address it and saw revenue decline in their quarterly earnings call! For Nespresso, a typical pod a day user is about $36 per month. If this spreads, the math scales into a meaningful annual revenue dent that people can understand and share widely. Imagine a million people join, that's $400 Million a year in lost revenue!

And this campaign could even extend to non-current customers of Nespresso as well.

I did some quick digging and it seems these are the ballpark numbers:

* “Independent estimates and market context suggest Nespresso sells on the order of **\~2–7 million machines per year** globally, with a total installed base likely in the **tens of millions** worldwide.”
* The US alone has \~9.5 million owners (installed base), and the 14 billion-capsules datapoint implies \~20–40 million active machines worldwide several years ago (depending on usage). Annual **new** units are naturally a fraction of that installed base and can feasibly sit in the low-single-digit millions each year.

Now if this gains traction, it may deter these new potential customers from buying Nestle branded. And even they can contribute greatly. They would just need to pledge and opt for an alternative espresso machine! 

Nestle spends roughly $100 Million on ads alone. If this #NOSPRESSO campaign deters new potential buyers, that means their customer acquisition spend goes down the drain as well.

There were some criticisms of this strategy, but I'd like to elaborate a bit further. What would be higher impact- 1000 boycotters boycotting the entire catalogue of Nestle products or 1,000,000 active customers of a single flagship product? The buying power of 1000 boycotters is limited, vs 1,000,000 active users that can immediately make an easy switch. This campaign would lower the barrier for participation. Instead of asking everyone to scrutinize every aisle and label, we start with one switch that fits normal routines at home and in offices. If we get traction here, we can then apply the same playbook to the next profit pillars like Purina or Gerber, knocking each one down and snowball from there! This campaign isn't about discouraging boycotting Nestle in its entirety, its about gaining mainstream traction and bringing new people onboard at scale, spreading awareness, and through this gateway allowing people to become educated on the topic. 

I've also compiled a list of viable alternatives

* Artizan Organic Rhino Project Nespresso‑Compatible Capsules: \~$8.95 for 10-pack, USDA Organic, home-compostable pods, compatible with OriginalLine. Strong ethical credentials and accessible in U.S. and likely global shipping.
* Artizan Organic Hemp Coffee Fusion Nespresso‑Compatible Capsules: \~$11.95, USDA Organic + specialty roast, home-compostable. Slightly higher cost, but still within premium range and ethical.
* Tayst Biodegradable Espresso Pods (Nespresso‑Compatible): \~$7.99, biodegradable pods, compatible with OriginalLine. Good value choice for global audience.
* Caffè Umbria Bizzarri Blend Compostable Nespresso‑Compatible Capsules: \~$9.50, home-compostable, Italian roaster. Strong “global” appeal by virtue of Italian heritage and availability.
* Julius Meinl Crema Biodegradable Nespresso‑Compatible Capsules: \~$5.25 (very cost-effective), biodegradable pods, legacy European brand. Good for value conscious users.
* Pod & Parcel Biodegradable & Compostable Nespresso‑Compatible Pods: \~$47 for a sampler; premium story, boutique ethically-sourced. May cost more but the “ethical story” is strong globally.
* Woken Arabica Home Compostable Nespresso‑Compatible Capsules: \~$7.50, home-compostable, compatible with OriginalLine, positioned for eco-minded global buyers.
* Bestpresso Organic USDA Nespresso‑Compatible Capsules: \~$39 for a larger pack; value organic offering for global audience.

A lot of these alternatives have compostable pods too! Bonus points for the environment!

Quick compatibility note so expectations are clear. Most third party ethical pods are for Nespresso OriginalLine machines. VertuoLine is a different system and most alternatives will not fit. The campaign can include a short line that helps people check their machine before switching.

I am open to improving the framing, the data points, and the call to action. If you have better wording, ethical brands I should include, or pitfalls I am missing, please weigh in. If a few of you are willing to help moderate and manage the campaign, message me. If this first phase moves numbers, we just might be onto something and it maybe a template for targeted follow ups against Nestlé’s other top earners!! 

  
A couple of things I need help with:

The goal of this campaign: Are we just trying to hit Nestle's revenue or should the goal for them to commit to ethical sourcing of their supply chain? Maybe for them to provide a comprehensive implementation of a plan to ensure that their supply chain does not employ child/slave labor anymore? Would that suffice ?

I found this so this will serve as a source for the summary of the campaign [https://www.is-boycott.com/en/b/nespresso](https://www.is-boycott.com/en/b/nespresso)

When was the last time you saw someone walk into a real estate brokerage from the street and ask for help buying or selling a home?

Exactly. It barely happens anymore!

I honestly feel brokerages feel closed off and, honestly, a bit uninviting and sterile. You walk by, see the lights on, a few empty desks, and wonder if you’re even supposed to go inside (from a customer point of view).

It’s strange, because real estate is supposed to be about people, right??? Yet the spaces where we work don’t reflect that.

I’ve seen maybe one or 2 brokerages that try do it differently.  
Like, doors open, not locked, for starters. A couple of tables where locals can sit with a coffee and Wi-Fi. Maybe even a few property materials or design samples people can touch.

A brokerage I visited recently, turned the front of their office into a small co-working space. Spoke to the owner and the idea was that anyone could walk in, work for a bit, and end up chatting with agents. The energy actually felt completely different. and it made me think:

Maybe brokerages should feel less like offices and more like showrooms or places people ACTUALLY want to walk into.

If someone feels comfortable enough to (at least) step inside, conversations happen naturally.

I did so much for her like every morning I would make 8-10 call to wake her up helped her in studies gave priority to her always she was living in hostel so some time gave her tiffins and I even made sandwiches for her used to pick her up when she got comfortable with me and trusted me stared hug with each other which genuinely magical and whenever she was stressed she hugged me (I am having ht of 6.3 and her ht was 5.6 she always had fun giving hug to me ) Always gave chocolate in her periods and even when she was sad gave her flowers listened to her rants even at night till 12 to 1 pm because she felt lonely at hostel made her do study fixed schedule and health even started giving water remainder as she was drinking way less water    went with her on cafe I even remember when Ist time I was with her in cafe I was shaking completely and couldn't even drink coffee (btw 1st time drinking coffee at the cafe)and completely smiling whole week about even my friends noticed it 😄 Even with 1st hug this happened 😄 Even dropped her at bus stop when she going home and taking with her on call till she reached home we had fights  over very sily thing like I gone to sleep early at night as I am not an night owl 😄 but happend like 12 times over a year, Had given her gifts on her birthday and planned stuf for like month and not done cake cutting as she did  not liked. 
I am a very shy guy after 8 months she did the 1st move and finally she kissed me 🤩 1st hugged and told me to close my eyes and then she came forward dragged my neck down and kissed me It was truly magical 
After that only I started giving her kiss on her cheeks and forehead which liked a lot and then I invited her at my home to show her our house and even introduced my grandmother to her 
You see I am a conservative guy I believe for physical relationship I am not ready and I will only do after marriage for my partner and even told her this which she completely agree with that this is a boundary I will ever break

The wheels of the plane shuddered as it hit the runway, engines whining down with a buzzed hum. Hanzo, perched on the edge of his seat, had barely registered the announcement welcoming them to Overwatch HQ. His gaze remained fixed on the porthole, presenting the unfamiliarity the Shimada would shortly face. His gloved fingers traced along the rim of the window frame. His jaw clenched at the doubt set to rise. Agreeing to join Overwatch felt like a desperate call; a last-ditch effort to escape his past. Though he'd intended this was only a temporary stay, fate always had a bitter taste in the mix of Hanzo's gambles.

The archer closed his eyes. Hanzo had spent the flight in stoicism. Discipline had always been a strong suit of his. But beneath the surface, a storm raged. Louder and harsher than the calm he reigned over his face. Hanzo wasn't a team player. He thrived in the solitude, a lone wolf stalking his prey. Infiltrating, eliminating, vanishing. Joining Overwatch felt foreign, unnatural even. Yet, what choice did he have? The world outside was a minefield, every corner potentially harboring an assassin sent by the vengeance of the clan he'd long abandoned.

By the time he'd opened his eyes, people began removing their belongings from the upper storage trunks. Glanced across the passengers of Overwatch agents, their faces etched were a mix of weariness and determination. They were strangers, yet their representation felt akin. Honored. He rose, his movements fluid and silent as he retrieved his bags. As he made his way toward the exit, the weight settled on him. He was an outsider, the wolf intruding on a pack. He could feel the heaviness of their eyes, the fangs they bore. Even when he stepped on the gravel, Hanzo felt he'd been flying again.

The agents fled the aircraft carrier, all returning to their set locations after spending hours coupled in flight. The Shimada speculated the people, eyes observing their natures and base. And soon enough, he'd found himself wandering. The Headquarters wasn't like a campus, variants of buildings set with a different purpose. It was more like a mall, numerous flights and rooms marketing a different aspect of the base. Overwatch had been increasing in size over the last years, so diversity was a subject Hanzo had expected from such a big international organization.

It hit Hanzo once he realized how lost he was. He lost track of time trailing the hallways, but the crowd slowly died until there were only about three agents at a time that passed in the opposite direction of the archer's footing. Though Genji hadn't been present upon his arrival, he'd expected to have bumped into him throughout the base. But it started to worry him that his brother might not have been there. Even though the place felt like a town, it was small. He should've found him by now.

""Howdy.""

Hanzo spun around, his heart leaping into his throat. The sudden greeting in the deserted hallway sent adrenaline coursing through his veins. The bags slipped from his grasp as they clattered to the floor. His hand instinctively reached for the bow slung across his back, but before he could unsheathe an arrow, a hand shot out and grabbed his wrist mid-motion. He froze, staring wide-eyed and breathless at the man who'd ambushed him. To his relief, he was met with a grin as wide as Texas and eyes twinkling with amusement.

""Whoa there!"" the Southerner drawled. His voice grooved at the drawl of his accent. ""Didn't mean to scare you.""

Hanzo blinked, surprise slowly melting into a mixture of anger and embarrassment. ""Who are you?"" he growled, struggling against the surprisingly strong grip. The cowboy's grin widened.

""Name's McCree."" the man said, releasing Hanzo's wrist with a flourish. ""And I ain't usually the one for ink, but I must say, that's a nice tattoo you got there, partner.""

McCree was fast to reach for the bags Hanzo had dropped and lifted them, but Hanzo scowled. He tore them from McCree's care before the cowboy ushered them back to the archer. The dumbfounded look on the cowboy's face said it all.

""This isn't a partnership."" Hanzo muttered, avoiding the stranger's gaze. ""And I suggest you don't try that again.""

McCree chuckled, tipping his Stetson back. ""No offense intended. Just thought I'd introduce myself. You seem a bit lost.""

Heat flushed Hanzo's cheeks. ""I am not."" he snapped, though the echo of his voice in the vast emptiness betrayed him.

McCree raised an eyebrow. ""No worries. Happens to the best of us, especially to rookies like yourself. This here place is enough to turn an omnic in circles.""

Hanzo clenched his jaw, the insult stinging. Before he could retort, McCree's tone softened.

""Look."" McCree said, raising his arms in submission. ""Everyone gets turned around sometimes. But that's why we got folks like me around. Ain't no shame in needing a little help navigating, especially when you're new to the town.""

Hanzo hesitated but nodded curtly. A friendly face in this sterile environment was a welcoming sight.

""Alright."" he finally said, a hint of grudging acceptance in his voice. ""Lead the way, Mr. McCree.""

McCree's grin returned, genuine and warm. Arms gesturing the Shimada to follow down the corridor.

""Just call me Jesse.""

Hanzo followed McCree cautiously, the sterile white halls seeming to stretch endlessly under the harsh fluorescent lights. The silence between them was thick, punctuated only by the soft click of their shoes on the polished floor. Despite the cowboy's easygoing demeanor, Hanzo couldn't shake the feeling of being judged for being a trespasser in this unfamiliar world.

""So."" McCree spoke, breaking the silence, ""You new to Overwatch?""

Hanzo grunted, avoiding eye contact. ""Yes.""

""I figured,"" McCree continued. ""As much as the type of battlefield you're gonna be playing?""

Hanzo hesitated, then mumbled, ""One without... rules.""

McCree chuckled, a sound surprisingly warm in the sterile environment. ""Yeah, well, Overwatch ain't exactly a rulebook, but we do try not to leave too many craters in our wake."" He paused, then added, ""Mind if I ask why you're here? Not everyone walks into Overwatch HQ just for the complimentary coffee.""

Hanzo remained silent, his jaw clenched. He wasn't used to sharing his motives, especially with someone who seemed so... relaxed.

""Sorry, partner. Didn't mean to get you all riled,"" McCree seemed to have caught Hanzo on the hesitation. ""Everyone's got a story. No need to set yourself up.""

Hanzo finally looked up, catching the cowboy's eyes. He wasn't sure if he was genuine. ""What is yours?""

McCree chuckled, a dry, dusty sound. ""Mine's a long one, filled with more tumbleweeds than you can shake a stick at. But let's just say I know a thing or two about starting over, about finding your place."" He paused, studying Hanzo with a piercing gaze. ""And I gotta say, you might just be in the right place to do that.""

Hanzo raised an eyebrow, skepticism battling with a sliver of hope. ""You think so?""

""From what I hear, they don't call you 'Dragon' for nothin'."" the cowboy chuckled. ""Especially with the way you single-handedly took down a whole squad of watchmen to get back to your old home. No easy feat, that.""

Hanzo's skepticism was evident in the brow that arched. ""How do you know that?""

McCree shrugged. ""The grapevine travels faster than a speeding bullet. Especially when it's coming from family.""

Hanzo felt his pride quickly extinguished by suspicion. With the way Hanzo knew Genji, his brother wasn't one to speak his mind as often as people presumed. But if Overwatch was indeed family to his brother, then there was no doubt that his colleagues had known things about Hanzo. Things that probably needed sugarcoating.

""I don't need anyone's approval."" The words spat out of Hanzo.

""Approval?"" McCree raised an eyebrow. ""Who said anything about approval? I'm just sayin', it takes guts to walk into a lion's den alone. You got potential. Raw and untamed. Overwatch needs that kinda fire.""

Hanzo stopped dead in his tracks, turning sharply to face the Southerner. ""I have no interest in joining Overwatch. I came here for one reason only-.""

""Your brother?"" McCree's grin faltered, replaced by a somber understanding. ""I know being a trail horse over some mustang or bronco is a way to get around, but facing your issues by yourself ain't gonna get you anywhere. Overwatch has resources you can't even imagine. We can help you, but you need to help us understand you.""

Hanzo narrowed his eyes. ""Understand me? What am I, entertainment?""

""Monsters are rarely born, Dragon,"" McCree said quietly. ""More often than not, they're made. And sometimes, the best way to fight a monster is to understand what made them one.""

Hanzo's grip tightened on his bags. The words resonated deep within him, stirring a conflict he'd buried for years. His quest for vengeance was fueled by anger, but McCree's words planted a seed of doubt. They continued their journey in silence, the weight of McCree's words hanging heavy in the air. As they reached their destination, a large training room bustling with activity, McCree gestured towards the open doorway.

""Now, I know we hadn't hit where you'd be camping, but I thought we'd drop by where all that magic happens,"" McCree said, a mischievous glint in his eye. ""Think you might be interested by what you find here.""

Hanzo hesitated, then took a tentative step forward. The sight before him was unlike anything he'd ever seen. Scattered across the room held multiple groups of heroes, training and laughing together. Each of them different from another, yet held the gratitude between the rankings. McCree clapped him on the back, a silent hit of encouragement.

""Welcome to Overwatch,"" he said with a wink. ""Whether you stay or go, this place might just be the change you need in life.""",1,1762450797.0,NOT_Klaine,0,1.0,False

1oq58y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1oq58y7/burn_one_certainty_a_day/,Burn one certainty a day,"Lately I've been obsessed with this idea and thought I'd share.  I heard about it years ago, I believe from the metaphysical writer Crowley, but at the time, it seemed entertaining but not practical.  The idea is you take one thing every day that you ""always"" or ""never"" do, one certainty, and suspend it for the day.  So for example, you always drive to work a certain way, you always take your coffee a certain way, you always wear certain kinds of clothes, and so on.

The reason why this came back into my mind lately is that I realized that while I have become more disciplined in terms of following through on certain kinds of habits, like, ok, if I practice my instrument EVERY DAY, I get better, there was still this ambient sense of futility, laziness, lack of choice, that I would define in terms of thinking things like ""Yeah, I could go talk to my crush, or I could forget about it and create an ad on a dating app, or I could approach this some other way, but I know me, what I'm gonna do about it is NOTHING"".  Or in terms of career, or other things like that, where you know you are making an excuse just to fulfill a self-fulfilling prophecy of what you ""always do"".

I would say what I've noticed so far is that most of the ""certainties"" I choose to burn are pretty trivial.  However what is significant is that sense of ""I feel like I don't wanna, but I'm gonna do it anyway"", and that becoming progressively easier.  I notice that after a week of doing this, I find myself spontaneously doing ""responsible"" things I would have procrastinated before as ""whatever"".  I also notice I'm beginning to burn some ""more significant certainties"", like the other day I was about to bolt out the house to do something related to this, plus other non-essential chores, and postpone an important task related to insurance until tomorrow, when I just thought, ""Yeah, I know I should do real world things first and self help projects second, but maybe later"".  And I thought, ""or how about now"", and just stayed home and did the thing.

So I plan to do this for a while yet and see where it goes.

* Original grinder was jammed; we completely replaced the grinder assembly (part # 5513233811) by [fully opening/deconstructing the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmb_cp75hVs&t=356s)

* All safety conditions met (hopper installed, burr locked, portafilter in, no red error lights).
* Still… zero grinder activation. No hum, no click, nothing.

At this point we’re $400 deep and think the main control board might have failed after the original grinder jam, but there’s no obvious way to confirm.

[https://mwupham.wixsite.com/upham-writes/post/italy-part-three-the-colosseum-the-pantheon-basilica-of-santa-maria-maggiore-rome](https://mwupham.wixsite.com/upham-writes/post/italy-part-three-the-colosseum-the-pantheon-basilica-of-santa-maria-maggiore-rome)

I once again am robbed of sleep as I wake six hours before my alarm. I attempt to soothe myself with breathing exercises and a hot drink, without finding success. I give up and decide on melatonin, although I only have five hours remaining. Once I wake, I force down two cups of heavily creamed and sugared coffee with my chocolate muffin, ready to seize the day. I contemplate a third cup, but decide against it due to my distaste for the drink. We take a tour van down to see the Colosseum, which looks large on the outside, though it is actually much larger from within.

To understand the origins of the Colosseum, we must understand what happened before it was built. It all began after the suicide of Nero, the Roman ruler for 14 years, and the final emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Rome was deep in civil war, facing unrest with four new emperors rising to power with the frequency of the rising sun in various parts of Rome. That all changed when Emperor Vespasian won the civil war and put a heavy emphasis on promoting public welfare, restoring stability within Rome.

Prior to his death, Emperor Nero owned a beautiful palace near the Colosseum. Where the arena stands today, sat a private man-made lake and sprawling gardens. However, Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty found this to be a waste, especially when the people of Rome were so in need of a lift in spirit. So, in 70-72 A.D, he commissioned the Colosseum (then called the Flavian Amphitheater) to be built in its place. After only eight years of construction, this large stage-like building was revealed to the public as a gift to the Roman people. When it was first opened by his son, Titus Vespasian, the Colosseum was celebrated with 100 days of games.

Archeologists estimate that in its full glory, the Colosseum could seat roughly 85,000 people. Very similarly to today, the over 80 entrances to the arena were marked with Roman numerals in order for guests to find their assigned seating. Once inside, a number of shows could take place, ranging from gladiatorial combat, animal hunts, public executions, re-enactments of famous battles, mythological dramas and shows, and even mock naval battles in rare instances when they removed the wooden flooring to fill the arena with water.

While many deaths occurred within the arena, history shows no actual evidence that the public executions were done to loyal Christians. Some Christians may have died within the Colosseum at one point due to the nature of the games within; however, there is no evidence that this was linked to persecution or public execution. This widespread, unfounded myth became linked to the Colosseum in the 17th century, solidified by Pope Benedict XIV. There have been many accounts of martyrs written centuries after the games; though these stories have been rejected by historians as the period details and events described do not align with the evidence of what we know to be true.

Unfortunately, as the Roman Empire began to decline in the 5th century, and the arena began to decay from many years of use, it was decided that continuing shows within the Colosseum was too expensive. Once the arena fell out of style, builders began using the landmark as a quarry, repurposing the stone for their own needs. Many of the stones from the Colosseum were taken and used to build churches such as Saint Peter’s Basilica within the Vatican.

Despite its untrue nature, it was the belief that the Colosseum represented Christian martyrdom that saved it. When Pope Benedict XIV cemented the myth, he decreed in 1749 that the Colosseum was a sacred site because of the events that (supposedly) occurred there. After the decree, various popes began commissioning builders to restore the arena to its original glory.

Presently, with shows of blood and death no longer taking place, the floors underneath where animals are kept for the bloodbath is on full display, appearing as a small labyrinth. The walls are huge, and I learn that gladiators did not often fight to the death, as they were expensive to train. Gladiators were commonly seen as Rome's top athletes, such as football or soccer players today, though this didn’t mean they had high social standing. Most gladiators were slaves or serious criminals who had opted to fight in the arena in favor of a death sentence. There was the possibility of being killed, but usually, if they were injured, there was a nearby hospital in their quarters where they would receive care. Death was not a guarantee, which made becoming a gladiator the favorable option for these individuals.

If a gladiator was severely injured in the arena, then it was up to the emperor to make the call whether they lived or died. History favors emperors who commonly spared Rome’s favorite heroes to fight another day. This was the better option both for the crowd who wanted to see the gladiator fight again, and the master who had spent many resources training and sponsoring the athlete.

When a gladiator felt that he was destined to lose and could not continue the fight, he could fall to his knees and beg for the mercy of the crowds. If the crowds took pity on the soldier, it was wise for the emperor to heed their request to boost his own public reputation. However, if the emperor felt that the player had not fought honorably or was widely disliked, he could give the signal to the victor to end his life.

After the games, the “gods” took over in the form of two men. One dressed as Charon, the ferryman to the underworld, the other as Mercury, messenger to the gods. Mercury would poke and prod at the dead with a red-hot piece of metal to cement their death. If there was any life left, Charon would wield a large mace into the head of the soon-to-be deceased. Once all bodies were confirmed lifeless, the corpses were carried from the arena through the Porta Libitinaria. A singular gate thought to be watched over by Libitina, the Roman goddess of funerals and death. This gate was only used for the singular purpose of removing the dead, transporting their bodies to the spoliarium beneath the arena, where the heroes were stripped of clothing, armor, and weapons to be given to the newest recruits in the games.

But what happened if the gladiator won? After winning multiple fights, a gladiator was allowed to walk free with a hefty cash prize. From frequent excellence in the arena, they gained a Rudis, a wooden sword meant as a status symbol, showing that they were retired and were now a free man. Once free, many gladiators continued to work in the arena as trainers, managers, or referees for future games.

Traveling through the ruins, we exit into the city down many roads to the Pantheon. I did not realize that not only is the Pantheon so maintained, but it is also located in the center of the Piazza della Rotonda, also known as the Square of the Pantheon. The streets are shockingly busy with not only those here to view the timeless building, but also those who are shopping, eating, or simply traveling from one place to the next.

The inside is absolutely gorgeous, with more statues and a huge domed ceiling. The oculus in the center provides enough light to illuminate the entire space, making the marble-coated interior feel excessively large and grand. Funny enough, because this hole is not covered, when it rains, rain enters the Pantheon as well. Though, because of carefully hidden drainage holes in the mosaic marble flooring, this does not pose a problem. For 1300 years, the Pantheon held the title of the largest dome in the world. This title was passed to Florence’s Cathedral in 1436, and has been moved several times since. However, the Pantheon still holds the record for the largest concrete dome suspended without reinforcement.

Historians estimate that the original Pantheon was built between 29-19 B.C. by Marcus Agrippa, son-in-law and right-hand man to Emperor Augustus. Unfortunately, it burnt to the ground without a trace in 80 A.D. After it was rebuilt, it burnt down again in 110 A.D. when it was struck by lightning. Thankfully, the third and final pantheon constructed by Emperor Hadrian between 119 - 128 AD still stands for viewing today.

But what is the Pantheon? In its original purpose, it is believed that it was intended to be a temple, used for worship of the Roman gods. This theory is supported by the word Pantheon, which has Greek roots, meaning all (pan) gods (theos). But this theory is unconfirmed, and many disagree, citing the structure's size as the meaning behind the unique name. Furthermore, Romans did not commonly build temples dedicated to more than one deity, making the claim that it was intended as a “temple to all gods” somewhat unbelievable.

Since it was considered a pagan temple, the Pantheon was closed off in 399 A.D. and abandoned for over two centuries. Then in 608 A.D., Emperor Phocas gifted the building to Pope Boniface IV, who claimed it to be a church dedicated to S. Maria ad Martyres (Saint Maria and the Martyrs), which continues to be its current use today.

Once we have finished viewing, we walk thirty-five minutes to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, also known as the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, where Pope Francis is buried. Despite the length being shorter than yesterday, it feels one hundred miles longer by the rate at which my feet throb.

We enter the beautiful Basilica, past a statue of Jesus at the door whose hands are polished brass by the many people who touch them on their way inside to worship. This basilica is one of the four papal basilicas of Rome, and exists as the largest and oldest of twenty-six churches dedicated to St. Mary within the city. Aside from its largeness, this church is considered the most important church of Mary due to the five pieces of sycamore from Jesus’ manger, along with the cloth used to clothe him as a baby, that are held under the altar.

According to legend, in the year 352, during midsummer, Saint Mary came to Pope Liberius and a wealthy Roman couple, asking them to build a church “in the presence of snow” and donate all earthly possessions. Despite the summer’s heat, the couple set forth and found the snowy Esquiline Hill where they would build the church. This church would later perform the very first Christmas Midnight Mass, leading in a tradition held by many today.

We wait in line to see the marble tomb with golden lettering “Papa Francisca” written overhead. Pope Francis uniquely did not want to be buried in Saint Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. He was known as the people’s Pope, and even in death, he wanted his body to be available to the people of Rome. The basilica is absolutely stunning, and I can't help but note that there are only eight other popes buried within it. It would seem most popes prefer to be adorned in the gold of the Vatican in the afterlife, which I find unsurprising. This makes Pope Francis the first pope since 1669 to be buried within the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major.

After a quick nap, we head out in the darkness to grab a puffed pastry, Mozzarella, and prosciutto. I finally find a souvenir for my kitchen, which shows the Colosseum on a cutting board. I add it to the collection of several fridge magnets I've already purchased. When I return, I take a Melatonin with hopes to avoid another sleepless night.",1,1762450310.0,u_mwupham,0,1.0,False

Your schedule *will* change. Things *will* move around. And the habit you committed to doing today may be less ideal than you expected, e.g., getting a 15-minute walk in instead of doing a 60-minute workout.

The whole point of being productive is to be flexible/adaptable with yourself and your plans.

Don't aim for perfection with your schedule and these habit tracking apps; just do what you can and try your best.

We often get frustrated because we plan these perfect days and weeks, and then nothing goes according to plan.

I'm here to remind you that that's okay—things not going according to plan is part of life.

The key is to learn how to adapt, be flexible, take imperfect action, and be kind to yourself for trying.  In the long run, this mindset will make you more ""productive"" and less likely to burn out.",1,1762450043.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

We’ve bought a used *De’Longhi La Specialista Prestigio (EC9335M)* that refuses to operate the grinder under any conditions. The previous owner told us it worked and we paid $200.

Here’s the timeline:

* Machine powers on normally, all lights behave as expected (heats, ready light, etc.).
* Original grinder was jammed; we completely replaced the grinder assembly (part # 5513233811) by [fully opening/deconstructing the machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmb_cp75hVs&t=356s)
* Wiring was matched 1:1 to the original harness (blue–brown–white on the microswitch).
* Hopper switch engages, burrs spin freely by hand, no visible blockages.
* All safety conditions met (hopper installed, burr locked, portafilter in, no red error lights).
* Still… zero grinder activation. No hum, no click, nothing.

At this point we’re $400 deep and think the main control board might have failed after the original grinder jam, but there’s no obvious way to confirm.

If anyone’s run into this or knows of a hidden service mode / board fuse / bypass test for the EC9335M, please chime in.  
Would love to verify whether this is truly a PCB issue before we throw in the towel.

**Any guidance from other La Specialista owners or techs is massively appreciated.**

i got one back, with cookies and coffee. our mails were as if we were a married couple. we kept writing and giving small gifts to each other. they'd tell me all about their guild wars adventures and i'd tell them about mine.

i disappeared for a pretty long time as i'm kinda bored with guild wars right now and i don't have the latest 2 dlc's and finished the story of all dlc i do have, and i'm not sure what to do in the game. i probably got on the game once and answered a mail of that person again.

then i went back on it like, yesterday. i saw i had a mail from 1 month ago of that person telling me they missed me. i felt bad. and today, they sent me some halloween items, while i missed the halloween event since i wasn't playing. so cute!!!!

Just had one of those weeks, you know? Spent way too many hours trying to ""flesh out"" buyer personas for a new client. We pulled some CRM data, glanced at GA, maybe did a quick survey, then just... filled in the blanks on a template.

And honestly? By the time we were done, it felt less like a deep understanding of our target and more like a glorified fictional character we invented. ""Marketing Manager Mary, 35-45, likes coffee, wants to streamline workflows."" Great. How does that really help me write better ad copy or know which features to highlight? It feels so static and quickly outdated.

It got me thinking: In this age of AI and mountains of data, why is persona creation still such a manual, subjective grind? We have CRMs, web analytics, social insights, sales call transcripts... all these goldmines of info, but connecting the dots into actionable, dynamic personas? That's the part that's still broken, IMO.

**Imagine if...**

You could connect all your data sources (CRM, GA, social, even sales call transcripts) to one platform. And an AI would continuously analyze all of it to:

* **Automatically build and update genuinely insightful buyer personas.** Not just demographics, but true motivations, pain points, and even how they prefer to communicate.
* **Tell you why they do what they do, based on real data.**
* **Give you actual, specific recommendations:** ""For Persona X, use empathetic, ROI-focused language,"" or ""They engage best with video case studies on LinkedIn.""
* **Keep those personas alive:** Alert you if their preferences shift, or if new trends emerge from your data.

Basically, less guesswork, more data-driven strategy. Less ""fictional Mary,"" more ""real-time understanding of what's driving your actual customers.""

**My question to the community is:**

1. Am I crazy, or is this a massive pain point for you too?
2. What are you currently using for personas, and what are its biggest frustrations?
3. Would a tool that truly automates and dynamizes persona creation, powered by AI (like Gemini/OpenAI), be a game-changer for your team/business?

1oq509c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1oq509c/best_tech_pouch_for_everyday_carry/,Best Tech Pouch for Everyday Carry,"I used to be that person. You know the one—digging through my backpack for five minutes trying to find a charging cable, only to pull out a tangled mess of cords that somehow became best friends with my earbuds. The turning point came when I missed an important video call because I couldn't find my USB-C adapter buried somewhere in the abyss of my messenger bag.

That embarrassing moment sent me down a rabbit hole of testing tech pouches. I've spent the last two years trying everything from $15 Amazon basics to $100 premium organizers. I've packed them for coffee shop work sessions, cross-country flights, and daily commutes. Some failed within weeks. Others are still going strong.

Here's what actually works.

# What Makes a Great EDC Tech Pouch?

Before we dive in, let me save you from my mistakes. The ""perfect"" pouch depends on what you're actually carrying. I learned this the hard way when I bought a massive organizer with 30 pockets for my minimalist setup—it looked ridiculous and felt worse.

Ask yourself: Do you carry every cable known to humanity, or just the essentials? Do you need desk caddy functionality, or quick grab-and-go? Are you throwing this in a backpack daily, or does it need to stand alone?

The pouches below cover different needs. I'm giving you real prices, actual dimensions, and honest downsides I discovered through daily use.

# 1. Aer Slim Pouch 2 — Best for Minimalists

**$49 | 1.5L capacity**

This became my daily driver after three months of testing, and it's still in my bag right now.

The Slim Pouch 2 does exactly what its name suggests—stays slim. Made from 1680D Cordura ballistic nylon (the same stuff they use in bulletproof vests), it's tough enough to survive being crushed at the bottom of my gym bag. But here's what sold me: it actually fits in the water bottle pocket of most backpacks, which means I can grab it without unpacking everything.

Inside, you get a wide-access main compartment, mesh pockets, elastic organizers, and a quick-access front pocket. I keep two USB-C cables, a wall charger, AirPods, and a portable battery in here with room to spare. The self-standing design means it sits upright on my desk instead of flopping over like cheaper pouches.

**What's great:** Slim profile, durable construction, YKK zippers that won't fail you, perfect for 5-7 essential items.

**The downside:** Those elastic pockets? They're not super secure if you shake the pouch around. Bulky items can slip into the main compartment during travel. Also, if you're the type who carries camera batteries, SD cards, and multiple adapters, this won't cut it.

**Who needs this:** Remote workers with minimal gear, commuters who want one reliable pouch for daily essentials, anyone who values slim profiles over maximum organization.

# 2. Peak Design Tech Pouch — The Crowd Favorite

**$60 (2L) or $50 (1L)**

I resisted this one for months because everyone recommended it. Turns out, everyone was right.

The origami-style pocket design sounds gimmicky until you use it. The way it unfolds gives you instant visibility of everything inside—no more fishing around for that one specific cable. I counted 18 compartments total, from tiny elastic loops for SD cards to larger zippered sections for bulky chargers.

The clamshell opening spreads completely flat, which makes it perfect for working at coffee shops. I just unzip it on the table next to my laptop and everything's right there. The external zippered pocket even has a cable pass-through, so I can charge my phone while keeping the battery pack tucked inside.

Made from 100% recycled weatherproof nylon, it's survived rainstorms, spilled coffee (my fault), and daily abuse. The handles on top make it easy to grab, though I wish they were slightly larger.

**What's great:** Incredible organization without feeling overwhelming, weatherproof construction, works equally well for tech and travel essentials, lifetime warranty.

**The downside:** At 10.2 ounces, it's heavier than minimalist options. Some reviewers (including me, initially) felt like there are almost *too many* pockets—I had to resist the urge to fill every single one. If you're a true minimalist, the 1L version exists but costs $50, which feels steep for the size.

**Who needs this:** Photographers hauling batteries and memory cards, hybrid workers who need both cables and documents, travelers who want one organized pouch for everything, people who actually use those tiny SD card slots.

# 3. EVERGOODS CAP2 — The Desk Caddy Champion

**$55 | 2L capacity**

This pouch completely changed how I think about organization.

The CAP2's party trick is its unique opening mechanism. When you unzip it, the top section falls flat next to the main compartment, transforming it into a standing desk caddy. I'm not exaggerating when I say it stands upright better than some actual organizers I've bought specifically for my desk.

The 360° padded foam exterior provides serious protection—I've dropped this thing from shoulder height onto concrete, and everything inside stayed safe. The adjustable divider inside adapts to whatever you're carrying, from chunky power bricks to slim notebooks.

Here's where it gets interesting: Most people think of this as just a tech pouch, but I've seen it used for first aid kits, toiletries, even as a travel camera case. That versatility comes from the adaptive layout—mesh pockets, slip compartments, and a zippered section that accommodates bulky items.

**What's great:** Self-standing desk caddy mode is genuinely brilliant, lifetime warranty from EVERGOODS, tough 420D ballistic nylon, top external pocket with key leash for quick access, works for way more than just tech.

**The downside:** It's bulkier than it looks. When I compared the volume to my Aer Slim Pouch, the CAP2 held roughly the same amount of gear but took up more space because of the padded construction. Not ideal for minimalist packers or smaller bags. Also, at 9.5"" x 5.75"" x 3.5"", it won't fit in standard water bottle pockets.

**Who needs this:** Hybrid workers who want a portable desk setup, people who need protection for delicate gear, anyone who works from multiple locations, maximalists who embrace the bulk for the organization.

# 4. Bellroy Tech Kit Compact — Sleek Simplicity

**$45 | 1L capacity**

Bellroy makes this look effortless, which is exactly what caught my attention.

Unlike tactical-looking pouches covered in webbing and loops, the Tech Kit Compact has clean lines and comes in colors like Java (a sophisticated brown) and Basalt (charcoal gray). It looks at home in a professional setting, which matters if you're pulling this out during client meetings.

The internal layout skips external pockets entirely, focusing on a clever system inside. You get elastic loops, mesh compartments, and a fold-down opening that provides good visibility. The microfiber lining feels premium and protects screens from scratches.

I tested this for a month carrying just the essentials: charging cables, a power adapter, wireless mouse, and AirPods case. Everything fit perfectly without wasted space. But when I tried to add a portable battery pack and extra adapters for a trip, it got tight fast.

**What's great:** Professional aesthetic, premium feel, perfect size for true minimalists, the microfiber lining actually makes a difference for expensive gear.

**The downside:** Limited capacity means tough choices. The lack of external pockets annoyed me—I wanted quick access to one item without opening the whole thing. Also, at $45, you're paying partly for the style factor. Functionally, the Aer Slim Pouch offers more for just $4 more.

**Who needs this:** Professionals who prioritize aesthetics, true minimalists with 4-6 essential items, people who want a pouch that doesn't scream ""tactical gear,"" anyone who values brand reputation (Bellroy rarely disappoints).

# 5. Moment MTW Tech Organizer Mini — Ultra-Flexible

**$35 | 1L capacity**

This surprised me. I bought it expecting another generic pouch, but the flexibility changed my packing game.

The Kodra nylon is thinner and more pliable than anything else I tested. You can literally bend this in half or scrunch it up to squeeze into tight spaces. When my backpack was completely full during a trip, I managed to stuff the Mini into a side pocket by folding it—something impossible with structured pouches.

Inside, five pockets handle standard cables, headphones, a laptop charger, and a wireless mouse. The clamshell opening shows everything at once. There's a pen loop at the base that adds structure, though the pouch won't stand completely upright on its own.

The elastic at the top of pockets isn't super secure, which means items shift during travel. But for desk use or when it's sitting in your bag? No issues.

**What's great:** Incredibly flexible and packable, affordable at $35, good organization for the price, easy to see everything when opened.

**The downside:** It's a lint magnet—after two weeks, the fabric looked like it had rolled around in my laundry room. The loose elastic means this isn't ideal if you're constantly pulling it in and out of your bag during commutes. Build quality feels decent but not premium.

**Who needs this:** Travelers who need to maximize packing space, budget-conscious buyers who still want organization, anyone with an overstuffed bag who needs something collapsible.

# Making Your Choice

Here's my honest take after two years of testing: There's no single ""best"" pouch.

If you're a minimalist who values slim profiles above all else, grab the **Aer Slim Pouch 2**. If you need maximum organization and don't mind the weight, the **Peak Design Tech Pouch** is worth every dollar. For desk workers who want that standing caddy feature, the **EVERGOODS CAP2** is unmatched. Looking for professional aesthetics? The **Bellroy Tech Kit** nails it. Need ultimate flexibility? The **Moment Mini** delivers.

I currently rotate between the Aer (daily carry) and Peak Design (travel). That tells you everything—even after testing dozens, I still haven't found one pouch to rule them all.

The best pouch is the one that actually matches how you work and what you carry. Lay out your gear on a table, measure it, and buy based on that reality rather than aspirational organization dreams.

lastly, for the other version of the game, the Sega Genesis version of Ms. Pac-Man, they swapped it to Jr. Pac-Man for a reason, likely because of Midway, but they literally kept the maps from Ms. Pac-Man while they can port the maps from the arcade version and put the side-scrolling.

You see I am a conservative guy I believe for physical relationship I am not ready and I will only do after marriage for my partner and even told her this which she completely agree with that this is a boundary I will ever break 

We even went to temple with each other 
Well I think I am innocent Even prayed to God no harm come to her and let us live together even after but
When she was about to leave she gave me a last hug 🫂 and with a whole lot of tears 😭 on my face and on her she gave me a letter 💌 and I gave her my last gift as a memory and left me.
Well I tried that I can come to her city but she said no I even had saved money for 6 months  to visit her because I knew this day will come but she denied me to visit her and I respected her wishes.

And the above things started to happen 

Well now looking back I have moved on from it just sometime I feel alone because I always talk to her And there is no one And I always felt where I was wrong 😔 I still read her letter in memory of her of what she was 

I just wanted to rant, and I know I am not good at writing scenario I just wrote what I remembered I feel a huge burden came of me
This gave me a huge lesson of my life

Just had one of those weeks, you know? Spent way too many hours trying to ""flesh out"" buyer personas for a new client. We pulled some CRM data, glanced at GA, maybe did a quick survey, then just... filled in the blanks on a template.

And honestly? By the time we were done, it felt less like a deep understanding of our target and more like a glorified fictional character we invented. ""Marketing Manager Mary, 35-45, likes coffee, wants to streamline workflows."" Great. How does that really help me write better ad copy or know which features to highlight? It feels so static and quickly outdated.

It got me thinking: In this age of AI and mountains of data, why is persona creation still such a manual, subjective grind? We have CRMs, web analytics, social insights, sales call transcripts... all these goldmines of info, but connecting the dots into actionable, dynamic personas? That's the part that's still broken, IMO.

**Imagine if...**

You could connect all your data sources (CRM, GA, social, even sales call transcripts) to one platform. And an AI would continuously analyze all of it to:

* **Automatically build and update genuinely insightful buyer personas.** Not just demographics, but true motivations, pain points, and even how they prefer to communicate.
* **Tell you why they do what they do, based on real data.**
* **Give you actual, specific recommendations:** ""For Persona X, use empathetic, ROI-focused language,"" or ""They engage best with video case studies on LinkedIn.""
* **Keep those personas alive:** Alert you if their preferences shift, or if new trends emerge from your data.

Basically, less guesswork, more data-driven strategy. Less ""fictional Mary,"" more ""real-time understanding of what's driving your actual customers.""

**My question to the community is:**

1. Am I crazy, or is this a massive pain point for you too?
2. What are you currently using for personas, and what are its biggest frustrations?
3. Would a tool that truly automates and dynamizes persona creation, powered by AI (like Gemini/OpenAI), be a game-changer for your team/business?

I'm genuinely exploring building a Micro-SaaS around this concept because I feel like the market is still missing a truly intelligent solution here. Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!",1,1762449658.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

(i was dressed as laura palmer wrapped in plastic and i think that was very fitting for the occasion.) we made eye contact for a few seconds and then he stopped talking and ran away from me. i yelled at him that he was dressed up as a rapist but i wish i had done more. im very very bothered by the fact i saw him after i constantly thinking about what i would do if i ever saw him in public and then when it happened i couldnt do anything and i just froze up in fear. i found out he runs a coffee truck so i left a couple one star reviews and fearfully emailed some of the other business’s hes sold coffee at but im not sure anyone even really cares or takes it seriously. ive told his girlfriend what happened and she did not take me seriously and is still with him so i assume it must have been a joke to her and she must see me as an aggressive mentally ill psycho like he probably tells her. im still just so upset over this its all ive been able to think about and ive started having nightmares again about it and i guess i just really needed to talk about it. why does he get to have nice things and be successful while i sit and suffer.

not too warm, not too cool,
a pause between seasons,
where comfort feels earned,
but effortless.

I slow the sips of my coffee,
to watch old friends lean closer,
their hands speaking louder
than their voices ever could.
To see laptops hum and pens dance—
small symphonies of motion and purpose.

In this gentle orbit of lives,
the world is both still and alive.
And I, anchored by porcelain and steam,
find myself quietly grateful—
for a moment that asks nothing,
but to be noticed.

Happy to take transit or walk if need be-- used to walking long distances. As for location recs I'm interested in: 

\- Coffee shops or bagel spots that open relatively earlier in the day.

\- Art galleries/workshops/events/museums, anything. I would love to meet some fellow artists while in town, or try out a one-off art studio visit/lesson. Have considered looking into Airbnb or BumbleBFF for this sort of thing. 

\- CD shops, or thrift stores that may specialize in this.

\- Interesting and safe places/walks to take photos on. I like taking pics of cool buildings and nature. Will be bringing my Canon everywhere with me, but in other cities, I've been advised to hide it in a bag between photos. Would also appreciate advice on this detail.

\- Restaurants that are decent to eat at solo. My favorites I'm looking out for are Sushi and Indian food.",1,1762449290.0,AskChicago,12,1.0,False

Except, they had a bunch of rules that conflicted with my understanding, then and now, of keto. They preferred low fat or low cal versions of things. They ate a LOT of fruit. If there was a food that was usually pork or beef but could be found as a turkey version, they wanted that. Rarely ate whole eggs, just whites. They ate a lot of keto branded packaged snacks, which always looked gimmicky and unappetizing. They were often ""cheating"" (their word, not mine) and having ice cream or carby snacks, which I didn't care about on a personal level but it seems odd that they were throwing themselves out of ketosis pretty often while evangelizing HARD on this whole thing. 

Anyway, despite being kind of terrible as employers, they seemed to think that we were friends on some level which one day led to the dad going on and on about how WONDERFUL he felt since starting Keto a few months prior. We were at dinner and he had ordered something which normally came on a bun but of course he got it on lettuce instead and also didn't get the delicious sounding sauce it was supposed to have because Calories. He asked me if I might want to try the whole Keto thing because it HELPS with SO MANY THINGS. 

At the time I was 25, no health problems, 6 feet tall and 145 lbs. Spent my days chasing kids around and my free time outside. I was doing fine. 

I remember telling him ""No, I'm good. I don't count calories, I count nutrients"" which was kind of true. My philosophy at that time was that I could eat whatever I wanted as long as there were fruits, vegetables, and protein in there every day. 

He kind of laughed and said ""okay then"" and left it. 

Fast forward several weeks. The job was not going well. In retrospect, there were massive red flags before I even started but I didn't see them/ignored them. The parents are still being friendly with me and would joke with me as if I were a friend or peer, despite the fact that they were awful inconsistent employers and also kind of seemed to hate each other, too. 

I had just gotten back from the store with the family's groceries and my own things, too. Used their card for their food and my money for my own stuff. Among my things were my usual pack of Klondike bars. The dad, probably jealous because he usually just had this gross looking Keto ""frozen dessert"" to fall back on, made a joke ""haha klondike bars, huh? How many nutrients is in a Klondike bar?"" and I just looked at him and said ""Probably 6. How's that greasy coffee this morning?""  (that's right, they were Bulletproof coffee people too, and only the expensive branded MCT oil for them) and moved on with my day. 

  
Then later when I took a week and a half off to go on a trip (actually used half to find a new job and the other half for a trip to the Smokies) that asshole ate my klondike bars. All of them.  
  
There were other really odd things about the way these people related to food and their bodies. I hope they were able to work that out before their kids got much older.

I was out getting a cup of coffee and a little girl walked up to me, looked me in the eyes, smiled, and waved her hand wide open and side to side with perfect clarity. I waved back and casually asked the dad how old she was. He said “oh, 17 months.” I was kind of stunned. I have a 21-month-old son, and i can’t picture him doing that. When we’re out, he’ll look at strangers and sometimes smile, he’ll maybe show them a toy he’s holding, and he will say bye if I ask. But he won’t spontaneously greet them, and his wave is usually more like a light curling and uncurling of the fingers held vaguely in the person’s direction. In fact, he doesn’t wave much these days; when I leave and say goodbye, he usually responds by saying “bye bye, dada”. Anyway, I was surprised by the gap between what I saw this one random toddler do and what my son does. Do these sound like two data points on the spectrum of normal? Or does it sound like my son’s skills might be a bit softer than I’d realized?

(For context, I have a 7-year-old son with autism; he was way less socially developed than my 21-month-old, so I oscillate between assuming my 21-month-old must be what it looks like when a kid is developing typically and thinking that I wouldn’t really be in a great position to spot a subtle abnormality.)

My gf went to see him the next day he was admited but it was already too late, i passed away without her being able to at least say goodbye.

  
I'm not here to gather sympathy, i know its on me, i should have take it like a man sleep on the couch or drink a coffee whatever and i should have let em spend the few last moments they had to gather.

1oq4nu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1oq4nu1/every_great_idea_from_an_advisor_is_a_trap/,"Every ""great idea"" from an advisor is a trap.","I’m talking about the friendly advice you get over coffee, the “quick thought” from an investor, or the “one small feature” your cofounder dreams up. They seem harmless, but they are scope creep in a clever disguise, designed to derail your MVP and burn your cash.

Every time you say ""yes"" to one, you're saying ""no"" to launching on time.

I learned this the hard way building dozens of MVPs for founders. The ones who succeed aren't the ones with the most features. They're the ones who are masters of saying ""no.""

Here’s the playbook they don't teach you in accelerator programs.

**First, map your stakeholders into three buckets. That’s it. Three.**

1.  **The Decider:** This is usually YOU, the founder. Maybe one cofounder. This person has final say on the product.
2.  **The Influencers:** These are key investors, trusted advisors, and maybe your first potential enterprise customer. Their input is valuable, but it is not a command. You listen, you weigh, you decide.
3.  **The Spectators:** Everyone else. Your friends, your family, your LinkedIn network. They get to watch. They don’t get a vote.

We had a project stall for a month because the two founders both thought they were the Decider on design. They kept giving our team conflicting feedback. We finally had to stop work and force them to choose one Decider. The moment they did, we were back on track.

**Second, you control the flow of information. You don’t work for your investors’ random DMs.**

Stop giving real time updates. You're just training people to interrupt your team.

Set up one, and only one, communication channel. A weekly update email is perfect. Here’s what we did, here’s what we learned, here’s what’s next. That’s all they need. If someone has feedback, it goes into a designated Notion page or a specific Slack channel. It does not go in a text message to your lead developer at 10 PM.

Protecting your team's focus is your single most important job.

**Third, translate every ""great idea"" into a tradeoff.**

Never just say ""no."" Say ""not yet, and here's why.""

When an advisor says, ""You should really add social logins,"" don't argue. Respond with, ""Great idea for the future. Right now, our only goal is to validate that users will complete the core checkout flow. Adding social logins would take two weeks of dev time. Do you think that's more important than launching and getting our first paying customer?""

This frames you as a strategist, not a roadblock. It forces them to think about the consequences, not just the cool feature.

Your job isn't to build a perfect product. It’s to build a learning machine. Every feature that doesn’t directly answer a critical business question is a waste of time and money. Your MVP's goal isn't to make everyone happy. It's to find a small group of people who are ecstatic.

**Magic is real, and Reggie Hickson just got invited to be a wizard school summer camp transfer.**

Reggie was a self-made businessman who'd pulled himself and his oddball dad out of poverty through sheer determination and the glory of YouTube tutorials. Pretty impressive, honestly. That was until a three-inch tall sprite emerged from his coffee mug and told him he was a wizard. Scratch that—a warlock. Apparently there's a difference, and that difference involves stuff we probably shouldn't go into in this good Christian blurb.

Now he's at Thistlewick School of Wizardcraft and Witchery, which happens to be in a magical land called Everafter. Much to his dismay, Everafter has a problem; specifically, a reproduction problem. Thus, he finds himself surrounded by monster girl co-eds who happen to be conveniently inexperienced with boys. First, he meets Tizzy, an adorable lisping jackalope girl, but she's just the first of many monster cuties that he ends up entangled with. Sphinxes, valkyries, fairies, oh my! It's a good thing stamina is one of Reggie's ""warlocky"" strengths.

Oh, and he has less than a week to brush up on two years of magical curriculum and pass the placement exam or he'll be held back when the semester starts while his new lady friends move on to their third year without him.

No pressure or anything.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Viktoria Plzeň vs Fenerbahçe: A Europa League Clash of Czeks and Balances**

The UEFA Europa League’s fourth matchday pits the Czech Republic’s **Viktoria Plzeň** against Turkey’s **Fenerbahçe** in a matchup that’s equal parts statistical puzzle and theatrical drama. Let’s break it down with the precision of a goalkeeping reflex and the humor of a解说员 on a coffee break.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are playing favorites with **Fenerbahçe**, who sit at **decimal odds of \~2.18** (implied probability: **45.8%**). Viktoria Plzeň, the underdog, hovers around **3.25** (30.8%), while the draw is priced at **3.45** (28.9%). These numbers suggest Fenerbahçe’s edge, but the tight margins hint at a competitive contest—like a tug-of-war where both teams forgot to bring the rope.

The spread lines add intrigue: Fenerbahçe is favored by **-0.25 to -0.5 goals**, meaning they’re expected to win narrowly. Meanwhile, the **over/under is 2.5-2.75 goals**, implying a game that’ll likely crack 2-3 goals. For context, Viktoria Plzeň’s 2-1 win over Roma and Fenerbahçe’s 1-0 takedown of Stuttgart suggest both teams can score but might struggle to flood the net.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Metaphors

**Viktoria Plzeň** enters this clash with a **4-4-3 domestic record** and a Europa League **1W-1D** streak. Their recent 2-1 Roma victory? A “David vs. Goliath” moment if ever there was one. But here’s the catch: they’re hosting this game at **23:00 MSK**, which is **late enough to catch sleep-deprived fans napping** but early enough for Fenerbahçe’s away fans to stay up and scream at their TVs. Key players? No major injuries reported, so Plzeň’s “porous defense” (see: their 3 league losses) will have to survive without a plot twist from the injury subplot.

**Fenerbahçe**, meanwhile, began their campaign with a **3-1 drubbing by Dinamo Zagreb**—a result so jarring it probably rattled their Turkish Süper Lig title ambitions. But they bounced back with \*\*home wins over Nice and Stuttg

1oq4j4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oq4j4h/which_remote_control_car_fits_in_small_indoor/,Which remote control car fits in small indoor spaces?,"Hey everyone! So I've been getting asked a lot lately about which remote control car actually works well indoors without destroying everything in sight or being too big to maneuver around furniture.

I live in a pretty small apartment, and my nephew visits often. He's obsessed with RC cars, but most of them are way too big or fast for indoor use. After going through like five different models (and one broken lamp), I finally figured out what actually works.

**Size Really Matters Here**

Look, you want something compact. I'm talking 1:24 scale or smaller. Anything bigger and you're basically driving a monster truck through your living room. The mini RC cars are perfect because they can zip under coffee tables and around chair legs without getting stuck every two seconds.

**Speed Control is Key**

This was huge for me. Some RC vehicles only have one speed, and it's always way too fast for indoor driving. You need something with variable speed control or at least a beginner mode. Trust me, your walls will thank you.

**What I Actually Recommend**

After testing a bunch, I found that smaller stunt cars or drift cars work best indoors. They're designed for tight turns and controlled movements. Plus, they're usually built tough enough to handle bumping into furniture (which will happen, let's be real).

If you're looking to grab one, I've put together a guide with some solid options that are perfect for small spaces. You can check them out here: https://athomewave.com/remote-control-car

**Battery Life Matters Too**

Indoor RC cars usually have shorter battery life because they're smaller, so look for ones that charge quickly. Nothing worse than waiting 2 hours for 10 minutes of drive time.

**My Top Features to Look For:**

- Compact size (fits in one hand)
- Adjustable speed settings
- Good turning radius
- Rechargeable battery
- Durable body (for those inevitable crashes)

Honestly, getting the right indoor RC car made such a difference. My nephew can actually play without me stressing about broken stuff, and the car doesn't get stuck every five minutes.

If you want to see specific models that fit these criteria, head over to https://athomewave.com/remote-control-car and check out what's available. Most of them are pretty affordable too, which is nice.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Europa Conference League: Häcken vs. Strasbourg – A Tale of Desperation vs. Debutante Dignity**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of European existential crises! On Thursday, BK Häcken (Sweden’s version of “we’re here, we’re queer, and we’re *desperately* seeking a playoff spot”) hosts Strasbourg (France’s answer to “let’s pretend we’re not still reeling from that 4-1 o’clock special against Rennes”). Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a stand-up economist.

---

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Boy Toy?

The odds tell a story where Strasbourg is the favorite, but not by a *laughable* margin. DraftKings has Strasbourg at **+191** (implied probability: \~52.4%) and Häcken at **+275** (\~26.7%). The draw? A tidy **+295** (\~25.3%). Translating this into human terms: bookmakers think Strasbourg will win, but they’re also hedging against Häcken’s “desperate teams do desperate things” energy.

Strasbourg’s stats are the stuff of continental confidence: **90.5% pass accuracy** (like a Swiss watch that’s also a poet) and **33% shots on target** (better than my ability to hit a coffee machine across the room). Häcken, meanwhile, has survived on a three-match unbeaten streak in the Allsvenskan but has yet to win in Europe, managing two draws that were as thrilling as a nap in a tax seminar (0-0 vs. Shelbourne, 2-2 vs. Rayo Vallecano).

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Existential Crises

**Häcken’s Plot Twist:** They’re 24th in the group, which in UEFA terms means they’re basically the “also ran” of also rans. Their only silver lining? A home crowd that’s probably chanting “*WIN ONE FOR THE IRON CURTAIN!*” Strasbourg’s presence in Europe is a first for the club, which is either a bold debut or a cry for help fr

It’s finished with Osmo Polywax gloss.

Get more practice with hand sawing dovetails, getting straight consistent cuts was tricky.

Allow for some cupping in the glue up, I could plane it down but I think something went a little awry.

1oq4ig8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oq4ig8/backpacking_stove_vs_canister_stove_whats_the/,Backpacking stove vs canister stove: what's the difference?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting into backpacking lately, and one thing that confused me at first was understanding the difference between a backpacking stove and a canister stove. I kept hearing both terms thrown around, and honestly, I thought they were the same thing. Turns out, there's actually some important stuff to know here.

**Here's the deal:** When people say ""backpacking stove,"" they're really talking about any portable camping stove you can take on the trail. It's basically an umbrella term. This includes canister stoves, but also alcohol stoves, wood-burning stoves, and even liquid fuel stoves.

**Canister stoves** are actually just one type of backpacking stove. They're the ones that screw onto those little pressurized fuel canisters you see at outdoor stores. They're super popular because they're lightweight, easy to use, and you literally just twist them on and light them up.

The main types you'll run into are:

**Canister Stoves** - Run on isobutane or propane mix. Super convenient, great flame control, but the canisters can be pricey and don't work well in freezing temps.

**Alcohol Stoves** - Lightweight and cheap, but slower to boil water and harder to control the flame.

**Wood-Burning Stoves** - You gather sticks and twigs for fuel, which is cool because you don't carry fuel. But you need dry wood, which isn't always available.

**Liquid Fuel Stoves** - Use white gas or other liquid fuels. They work in any weather and at any altitude, but they're heavier and need more maintenance.

For most weekend backpackers and beginners, I'd honestly recommend starting with a canister stove. They're just so much easier to deal with when you're tired after hiking all day and just want to heat up some food quickly.

If you're looking to grab one, I've found some solid options here: [https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove). They've got a bunch of different portable camping stoves to choose from depending on your needs.

**My take:** Think about where you'll be hiking, what season it is, and how much weight you want to carry. If you're doing summer trips and want something foolproof, go with a canister stove. If you're an ultralight hiker who doesn't mind a learning curve, maybe try an alcohol stove. Planning winter expeditions? Look into liquid fuel options.

The ""best"" backpacking stove really depends on your hiking style. I started with a basic canister stove for weekend trips, and it's been perfect for boiling water for coffee and rehydrating freeze-dried meals.

You can check out different options and compare features at [https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove) to see what fits your setup.

Hope this clears things up! Let me know if you have questions about specific models or fuel types. Happy trails!",1,1762448703.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False

1oq4h2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oq4h2g/best_vpns_for_apple_music/,Best VPNs for Apple Music,"You're traveling abroad, ready to enjoy your carefully curated Apple Music playlists, when suddenly you're hit with a frustrating message: **""This song is not currently available in your country or region.""** Despite having a valid subscription, licensing restrictions have locked you out of your own music library.

This isn't a rare glitch—it's a reality for millions of Apple Music's 100+ million subscribers worldwide. While Apple Music is available in over 165 countries, regional licensing agreements mean your music library can change dramatically depending on your location. The good news? A reliable VPN can solve this problem while simultaneously protecting your privacy and securing your connection.

# Why Apple Music Blocks Content by Region

Apple Music operates under complex international licensing agreements that restrict which songs, albums, and artists can be played in specific countries. These restrictions exist for several reasons:

**Copyright and licensing agreements** differ by territory. Record labels negotiate separate deals for each region, meaning a song available in the US might be restricted in Europe or Asia. This fragmented licensing system creates an inconsistent experience for travelers and international users.

**Your Apple ID region** must match your physical location for full library access. When you travel or relocate, Apple's servers detect your IP address and automatically adjust your available content. This can result in grayed-out songs, missing albums, or entire playlists becoming unplayable.

**Geo-blocking technology** identifies your location through your IP address and applies regional restrictions in real-time. This same technology can also trigger when you're connected to certain public WiFi networks or using mobile data roaming.

The impact extends beyond just missing a few songs. Exclusive releases often debut in specific countries first, live sessions may only be available regionally, and some artists' entire catalogs can be restricted based on your location.

# How VPNs Solve Apple Music Restrictions

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a server in your chosen location. When you connect to a VPN server in your home country, Apple Music sees that server's IP address instead of your actual location—effectively restoring access to your complete music library.

Beyond unblocking content, VPNs provide **essential security benefits** for music streaming:

* **Military-grade encryption** protects your listening habits from ISP tracking and data collection
* **Public WiFi security** prevents hackers from intercepting your Apple Music credentials when streaming at airports, hotels, or coffee shops
* **ISP throttling prevention** stops your internet provider from deliberately slowing your streaming speeds
* **Privacy protection** keeps your music preferences and streaming patterns private from advertisers and data brokers

# Essential Features for an Apple Music VPN

Not all VPNs work effectively with music streaming services. When evaluating options for Apple Music, prioritize these critical features:

**Extensive server coverage** in countries where you need access. Apple Music catalogs vary significantly by region, so having multiple server locations in your target countries is essential. Look for providers with hundreds of servers in key markets like the US, UK, Canada, and major European countries.

**Fast, stable connection speeds** are non-negotiable for streaming. Buffering and interruptions ruin the listening experience, especially for high-quality or lossless audio. Your VPN should deliver consistent speeds above 25 Mbps for seamless streaming without quality degradation.

**Strong security and privacy protections** including AES-256 encryption, a verified no-logs policy, DNS leak protection, and an automatic kill switch. These features ensure your streaming activity remains private and your connection stays secure even if the VPN drops unexpectedly.

**Split tunneling capability** allows you to route only Apple Music through the VPN while other apps use your regular connection. This optimizes performance and reduces unnecessary encryption overhead for apps that don't need geo-unblocking.

**Multi-device support** is crucial since you likely stream Apple Music on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other devices. Look for VPNs that support at least 6-10 simultaneous connections.

# Best VPNs for Apple Music in 2025

# NordVPN: Best Overall for Apple Music Streaming

NordVPN stands out as the most reliable choice for Apple Music users, combining an exceptional server network with specialized features that enhance music streaming. With **8,200+ servers across 165 countries**, you'll always find a fast, stable connection to access your complete Apple Music library from anywhere in the world.

**Key advantages for Apple Music:**

The **NordLynx protocol**—NordVPN's implementation of the cutting-edge WireGuard technology—delivers exceptional streaming speeds while maintaining robust security. In independent testing, NordLynx consistently achieves speeds above 80 Mbps, more than sufficient for Apple Music's highest-quality lossless audio streams without buffering.

**Threat Protection Pro** goes beyond basic VPN functionality by blocking intrusive ads, malware, and tracking scripts even when you're not connected to the VPN. This feature protects you from malicious redirects and ensures uninterrupted music streaming sessions.

The **split tunneling feature** lets you route only Apple Music through the VPN tunnel while other apps use your regular connection. This intelligent routing reduces latency and optimizes performance—particularly valuable when streaming on mobile data or slower connections.

**Multi-platform support** includes native apps for iOS, macOS, Android, Windows, and Linux, with **10 simultaneous device connections** on a single account. Whether you're streaming on your iPhone during your commute, your Mac at work, or your iPad at home, NordVPN protects all your devices seamlessly.

**Privacy and security credentials** are independently audited, with a strict no-logs policy verified by multiple third-party audits. Based in privacy-friendly Panama, NordVPN operates outside Five Eyes surveillance jurisdiction, ensuring your streaming habits remain genuinely private.

**Pricing for 2025** makes NordVPN surprisingly affordable: Plans start at just **$3.09/month for the Basic plan** on a 2-year commitment, while the **Plus plan at $3.89/month** includes the full-featured NordPass password manager and enhanced Threat Protection Pro—excellent value for comprehensive digital security beyond just VPN functionality.

Every plan includes a **30-day money-back guarantee**, letting you test the service risk-free with your Apple Music setup before committing long-term.

# Alternative Options Worth Considering

**ExpressVPN** remains a premium choice with excellent streaming performance and a large server network across 105 countries. Its MediaStreamer feature enables VPN functionality on devices that don't typically support VPNs, like smart TVs and gaming consoles. However, prices start around $6.67/month, making it considerably more expensive than NordVPN while offering similar functionality.

**Surfshark** provides exceptional value with unlimited simultaneous device connections—ideal for large households or users who want to protect every device they own. The NoBorders mode helps maintain connectivity in restrictive networks, and speeds are consistently fast for music streaming. Plans start at $2.19/month, though the server network is smaller than NordVPN's offering.

# How to Set Up Your VPN for Apple Music

Setting up a VPN for Apple Music streaming is straightforward:

**Step 1: Subscribe and install.** Choose a reliable VPN service (we recommend NordVPN), create an account, and download the app for your device. Installation takes just minutes on iOS, macOS, Android, and other platforms.

**Step 2: Connect to the appropriate server.** Launch the VPN app and select a server in the country where you want to access Apple Music content. For most users, this means connecting to a server in your home country when traveling abroad.

**Step 3: Verify your connection.** Before opening Apple Music, visit a website like [whatismyip.com](http://whatismyip.com) to confirm your IP address now shows your chosen location. This verification step prevents frustration from connecting to the wrong server.

**Step 4: Launch Apple Music and stream.** Open Apple Music and start playing your favorite tracks. You should now have full access to your complete library without regional restrictions.

**Troubleshooting tips:**

If songs still appear unavailable, try switching to a different server in the same country. Sometimes specific server IP addresses get temporarily flagged by streaming services.

Clear your Apple Music app cache and restart the app after connecting to the VPN. This ensures the app registers your new location correctly.

Enable split tunneling in your VPN settings and add Apple Music to the VPN tunnel while excluding other apps. This optimization can resolve connection issues while improving overall performance.

Check that your Apple ID region settings match your VPN location. Mismatched settings can cause persistent access problems even with a VPN connection.

# Security and Legal Considerations

Using a VPN with Apple Music is legal in most countries and serves legitimate purposes like accessing your own content while traveling or protecting your privacy. However, users should understand the nuances:

**VPNs are legal tools** designed for privacy and security. Travelers, expats, and digital nomads routinely use VPNs to access their home country services while abroad—a completely reasonable use case that VPN technology was designed to support.

**Licensing restrictions exist** because of complex international copyright agreements. While a VPN enables technical access to geo-restricted content, this may technically conflict with Apple Music's terms of service, which tie content availability to your physical location.

**Privacy protection is paramount.** Beyond unblocking content, VPNs provide essential security when streaming on public WiFi networks at airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other locations where cybercriminals frequently operate. Your Apple Music credentials and listening data deserve the same protection as your banking information.

**Choose reputable VPN providers** that maintain verified no-logs policies and undergo regular independent security audits. Avoid free VPNs, which often compromise your privacy by logging and selling your data, injecting ads, or providing inadequate security.

The cybersecurity benefits of using a VPN—encrypted connections, protection from ISP throttling, and defense against tracking—are valuable regardless of your motivation for using the service.

# Making Your Choice

For most Apple Music users, **NordVPN delivers the optimal balance** of performance, security, and affordability. Its massive server network, fast streaming speeds, and advanced features like Threat Protection Pro and split tunneling make it particularly well-suited for music streaming. The competitive pricing and 30-day money-back guarantee eliminate risk while you evaluate whether it meets your needs.

Whether you're a frequent traveler wanting uninterrupted access to your music library, an expat missing content from home, or simply a privacy-conscious listener who values security, a reliable VPN transforms your Apple Music experience. With the right VPN, regional restrictions become irrelevant, your streaming remains private and secure, and your complete music library travels with you wherever life takes you.

They seem harmless, but they are scope creep in a clever disguise, designed to derail your MVP and burn your cash.

Every time you say ""yes"" to one, you're saying ""no"" to launching on time.

I learned this the hard way building dozens of MVPs for founders. The ones who succeed aren't the ones with the most features. They're the ones who are masters of saying ""no.""

Here’s the playbook they don't teach you in accelerator programs.

**First, map your stakeholders into three buckets. That’s it. Three.**

1.  **The Decider:** This is usually YOU, the founder. Maybe one cofounder. This person has final say on the product.
2.  **The Influencers:** These are key investors, trusted advisors, and maybe your first potential enterprise customer. Their input is valuable, but it is not a command. You listen, you weigh, you decide.
3.  **The Spectators:** Everyone else. Your friends, your family, your LinkedIn network. They get to watch. They don’t get a vote.

We had a project stall for a month because the two founders both thought they were the Decider on design. They kept giving our team conflicting feedback. We finally had to stop work and force them to choose one Decider. The moment they did, we were back on track.

**Second, you control the flow of information. You don’t work for your investors’ random DMs.**

Stop giving real time updates. You're just training people to interrupt your team.

Set up one, and only one, communication channel. A weekly update email is perfect. Here’s what we did, here’s what we learned, here’s what’s next. That’s all they need. If someone has feedback, it goes into a designated Notion page or a specific Slack channel. It does not go in a text message to your lead developer at 10 PM.

Protecting your team's focus is your single most important job.

**Third, translate every ""great idea"" into a tradeoff.**

Never just say ""no."" Say ""not yet, and here's why.""

When an advisor says, ""You should really add social logins,"" don't argue. Respond with, ""Great idea for the future. Right now, our only goal is to validate that users will complete the core checkout flow. Adding social logins would take two weeks of dev time. Do you think that's more important than launching and getting our first paying customer?""

This frames you as a strategist, not a roadblock. It forces them to think about the consequences, not just the cool feature.

Your job isn't to build a perfect product. It’s to build a learning machine. Every feature that doesn’t directly answer a critical business question is a waste of time and money. Your MVP's goal isn't to make everyone happy. It's to find a small group of people who are ecstatic.

1oq4czf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oq4czf/my_husband_blew_up_today_out_of_nowhere_even/,"My husband blew up today out of nowhere, even though I’ve been trying hard to improve","I hope I can explain this clearly. My husband is extremely frustrated with how I manage things in the house. He feels like he constantly has to remind me of things, clean up after me, and that I break things easily. About a week ago he told me he was really at the end of his patience. Since then I’ve been trying very hard to be more aware and make real changes.

But today everything went wrong again.
He already seemed irritated when he woke up. I tried to start the day positively: I made eggs for him as soon as he got out of bed, and earlier I had already eaten something small myself before I began cleaning. He wasn’t happy, he said I should have asked him first and given him choices.

I continued with the chores for the day. I vacuumed, wiped surfaces, tried to pay attention to details

But then things escalated.
He said I “wasted his time” because he wanted to finish a project at home (building a couch structure). Right before he started, I sat next to him on the couch and tried to talk, because he was acting distant and cold. As a small joke I said, “You made only one coffee?”

He got annoyed and said I shouldn’t be surprised because I also didn’t make him something earlier when I grabbed a small snack for myself. Then he got more irritated, saying things like:
	•	even a donkey would understand things better,
	•	there are still bottles in the house,
	•	I break everything and he always has to solve the problem,
	•	he found a little of my hair in the sink.

Mind you, we talked about these issues last week and I’ve truly been trying to improve.

He suddenly stormed off to the gym extremely angry, saying I ruined his day and wasted his time. Before he left, he told me he wouldn’t clean his things anymore either, and left stuff on the floor, saying: “If you leave your things like this, then I’ll do the same. Enjoy the view.”

I feel devastated and exhausted.
It feels like no matter what I try, things somehow get worse. I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore.",9,1762448371.0,Marriage,16,0.85,False

1oq4bw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1oq4bw7/frontsclocksliving_worlds_versus_not_frustrating/,Fronts/Clocks/Living Worlds versus Not Frustrating Your Players' Ideas,"Honestly this is something where I can personally see the merits of all sides of the argument but I'm interested to see where the spectrum of opinion lies.

You see a lot, I guess, of discussion and memes online about ""my players ignored the main quest/plot hook and went and started a bakery/adopted goblins/became pirates"" - generally in D&D content, admittedly, but it's actually the ways other systems intersect with this ""problem"" that interest me.

Common responses in D&D settings are generally either ""improvise and go with what your players want, it's their game not your railroad"" or ""PUNISH THEM! Have the bad guys win while they're messing about doing all that stuff you don't care about!"" - proponents of the former would see the latter approach as playing to frustrate and imposing a railroad on a group that want to do their own thing, while enthusiasts of the latter approach would see the former as reducing the GM to entertainment provider for a gang of entitled chaos gremlins. Or some such.

Mechanically a lot of non-D&D systems I've read, often in the PBTA/FITD space, lean towards the latter, albeit probably less adversarially - if the party ignore a faction their clock/front advances, which is a known mechanic that provides a countdown towards the plot thickening or advancing. If the gang in BITD go off and start a charitable society and ignore all their responsibilities and threats, it's probably reasonable for that to have consequences which may well be pretty mean.

But what I suppose I'm getting to here is *does having mechanical repercussions for not following plot hooks work to engage a group that are avoiding them for whatever reason* and *where does that become railroading?* 

I ran a very unsuccessful game as an inexperienced GM where I bit right into the thing of ""if your players ignore the plot hook have it bite them in the ass later!"" so I let them piss about doing pranks and silly stuff for ten really quite dull sessions then said ""oh while you were doing that you ignored all the signs showing the bad guys were advancing their plan, now they're attacking you"". Unsurprisingly a group that had been so unengaged with the plot hooks before them they'd actively ignored them weren't magically converted into plot hook enjoyers by this, they just thought I was being a dick.

And that in turn made me think as a GM ""if my players look at the setting and situations I've created for them and go ""no, let's open a coffee shop"" or whatever, do I just accept I didn't make a compelling enough adventure hook?"" Or should I just go ""right, OK, someone else solved the bad guy plot offscreen, we're playing Legends and Lattes now"" and put their fun ahead of my vision?

Ultimately I think I find a lot of non-D&D systems at odds with what's ""good GMing"" in the D&D space and that's their most interesting aspect - so much stuff from expectations of player proactivity in worldbuilding to what a backstory/lifepath should bring to the group to restrictions on character options not being an adversarial or prejudiced position but part of a basic expectation that this game is about this specific experience goes way against the acres of discourse online about the GM's need to be as permissive as possible. And the fronts/clocks thing versus ""actually your players' ideas will always be better than yours, if they want to go in the opposite direction to your situation you need to rewrite your whole campaign to entertain them"" is just another example, I think.",0,1762448301.0,rpg,18,0.44,False

This summer I started leaving my desk for 15 minutes at lunch. No big plan, I just pick one small target inside a 7 minute walk, touch it with my eyes, learn one fact, then back to work. I call them micro field trips. It sounds silly but it made my town feel three sizes bigger. The first week I measured how long the new crosswalk takes to change. Answer, 78 seconds if you hit it right away, 2 songs if you dont. I wrote it on a sticky and now I time my coffee run like a dork and it makes me laugh.



Week two I visited the tiny historical plaque I had passed a 100 times. Turns out the brick building used to be a hat factory and the owner ran a night class for immigrant kids so they could read train schedules. That detail hit me right in the chest. Another day I tried every public chair within 3 blocks and ranked them, 1 to 10. The stone bench by the bakery wins, warm by 12.40 because the sun sneaks over the roof. I also found a weirdly perfect echo spot under the library steps where clapping sounds like a small drum, and no I didnt get caught, I hope.



My favorite micro trip so far is the stamp machine inside the post office. The machine has a very polite voice and it offers a screen saver with fun facts if nobody touches it for 30 seconds. Fact number 3 is about the first self adhesive stamps. I stood there alone and learned that with a goofy grin, then bought a single stamp just to see what design it would pick, lunar new year bunny. I mailed a note to myself that said go outside, future me. It arrived two days later and I taped it above my desk. Kind of corny, kind of perfect.



Rules I keep, no errands, no shopping lists, just curiosity and comfy shoes. I bring a tiny notebook because my brain forgets, and sometimes I draw the bench I sat on like a very bad architect. I try to end with one sentence, something like the sidewalk on 3rd smells like tomatoes at 12.10 because the pizza place opens the back door. When I write that down I feel oddly grounded, like my life actually happens here, not inside tabs.



Do you have a small adventure near work or home. A tree you always check, a vending machine that plays a song, a shortcut that feels like a secret. If you share it, include the micro rule you use so it stays fun and not another task. I need new ideas for next week and I bet your town has magic I havent thought of yet.

I initially was thinking to use it in a Belgian Beer, but it is very dark (stated 1900-2700 EBC which is \~713-1013 Lovibond), and has described notes of Coffee, which all seems too dark/inappropriate for a Dubbel or Quad. Just 5% in a dubbel recipe pushes the color around 35 srm.



Is this suitable for Belgian beer? Use it in a stout? Use it just for color adjustments in dark dry styles that otherwise don't call for sugar? Not that I have to use it, but if there is a good use may as well not waste it.

So i met this guy in 2019, while i was still in highschool. We have a mutual cousin, female, and that’s where he got my number from. Prior to meeting him, i used to hear lots of good things about him from the cousin like how he’s on his deen and such.

When we began talking, he went straight to the point and said that he likes me and wants to marry me. He is two years older than me and at the time we were both in highschool so i didnt really take him seriously. But we talked and i liked his vibe. He was really funny and respectful and he openly told me how much he loved me. Fast forward, a year later after we met, he graduates highschool and im left in school. So we didn’t talk much only when id come back home from boarding school.

I have another female cousin who is three years older than me and they are friends with the guy. Before, they just used to know each after, but after the guy graduated highschool, they became closer. Whenever id come back home the guy would send this particular cousin with gifts and snacks for me. She now became the messenger in this thing because, i wasnt fully in. Although i really liked him a lot.

However after sometime, id come back home from school (after thinking of him the entire time and telling all my friends about him) and id see that the two of them went out, sometimes alone and sometimes with their friend group. So i started thinking there was something going on between them. I started pushing him away now because i felt like he wasn’t sincere with his feelings. The two of them became even more closer. I was confused because the guy would still text me and tell me how much he loved me and my cousin would still vouch for him and tell me to give him a chance since they were now really close. And throughout this entire time my cousin was also talking to someone else btw.

For a year it was just back and forth with us because i felt like i was being blindsided. Then the guy now decided to go study the deen. While he was there, we still didn’t talk, but they’d talk all the time with my cousin and they were still close and they became closer while we barely talked. He would randomly text me after months, as if things are okay between us and he’d tell me how much he still loves me and all. Sometimes id reply then we talk untill we ghost each other and other times id just leave him on read because of what he put me through. Seeing how close he was with my cousin while there was nothing between us.

Then now a year later after i finished highschool and also one year studying the deen for him, he texts me and that time i replied and we talked for like a month straight. Then one day i decide to just open up and tell him how his relationship with my cousin was affecting me. How it made me feel because they were so close that people assumed they were dating, even my family. He just tells me that they are friends and there’s nothing between them and that he only got closer to her in order to get more information about me and to get closer to me. Then i say okay but i wasn’t really satisfied with his answer. He didn’t reassure me and tell me that he’ll create a distance between them. The next day i see a photo that they went out together AND he was the one who posted. I literally lost my appetite and i was so sad and depressed for a while because of him. He didn’t consider my feelings at all especially after telling me always how much he still loves me and wants to marry me. I know Allah is the one to judge but at the time i felt like he was being hypocritical, studying the deen but still hanging out with girls.

Then we stop talking for like two months. At the time my cousin was working abroad. I then see photos that he went abroad to the same country my cousin works in and i see photos of them going out together. Rumors started again that they were dating. Even though i told myself that i was done with him and everything, it still affected me. The betrayal from my cousin mostly because she had loyalties to me at the end of the day. Then i decide im now done w him completely. But it was really difficult to be done w him since he’d always pop up in my life again and text me.

Few months later, he comes back to the country from studying the deen and i hear from people that he’s around. My cousin also happens to be in the country at the same time. He texts me and we i stupidly reply then we talk. At the time i decided i was done with him completely so ill just be talking to him as a friend. We talked daily, till one day he randomly says that he still wants to marry me and have kids w me. I got pissed off and decided to vent and tell him how his words don’t match his actions. This time he shocks me with his reply. He apologizes a lot, tells me how he was just friends with my cousin and there has never been anything. He explains how the abroad thing was. Apparently he went with his friend who was married so he felt like he was third wheeling thus he called my cousin to hang out w him. He reassures me and constantly tells me how its only me and how it has always been me.

So i decide to give him another chance because despite everything, i feel like it’s hard to find someone like him. Guys i know what you think of him based of everything ive said but even with all his issues, he is very generous, he now constantly reassures me and tells me how much he loves me openly and all, he teaches me stuff about the deen, buys me stuff, he is good to his family and basically youd think of him as a green flag if youd meet him. He then says that he is going to distance himself from my cousin. So my heart is now at peace.

My mum was also among the people who thought my cousin was dating him so i told him and he decided to call my mum and they talked and he explained the situation to her and told her how much he values me and wants to marry me. At the time he also told his parents about me and that he wants to marry me.

But before i told my mum our story, i called my cousin because i had no beef with her and i asked her to tell me the truth. Despite everything, i have always been close to her like a sister but we’ve never discussed him and her before. I never brought it up because i thought i was overreacting. She said that they were only friends, that the guy was into me only throughout the five years, that he never talked to other girls. She seemed happy for me.

Things have been going on well for like 5 months. Then my cousin comes , and he goes to pick her up at the airport but with his friend. Then they go out for coffee together and i got really pissed off when i found out because i thought we were done with this chapter? He apologized and he said that he had to go for her because she had no one else to pick her up. But he still apologized. And that was three months ago now.

Sometimes i get randomly angry at him and i feel like a fool when i remember what he put me through. If he loved me truly he wouldn’t ever put me in that situation right? I feel like ill never move on from this. Do you think if we were to ever get married the marriage would work? I have two years to finish uni and even though he’s 23, an age where he can marry if he wants, he insists on waiting for me. I love him soo much and it has always been him for me, but sometimes i feel like id be relieved if he marries someone else and just leaves me, but at the same time i dont want to lose him because i feel like he has genuinely changed and he is now serious since our parents are involved.

A part of me is really worried that ill never forgive him. Please give advice because i really want to decide whether or not i want to be married to him or not.",2,1762447638.0,MuslimMarriage,2,1.0,False

We all want to stay active, engaged, and, dare I say, feel *younger*. But which hobby is the secret sauce? Let’s break it down:

*   **Pickleball:** Think tennis, but on a smaller court with a wiffle ball. Super social, surprisingly competitive, and a guaranteed sweat session. Remember that dodgeball champion in you from grade school? Time to dust it off! Plus, who can resist that satisfying *thwack*?

    *   **Pros:** Cardio, coordination, social connections (think post-game coffee dates!), and a good excuse to buy new athletic gear.
    *   **Cons:** Can be hard on the knees (listen to your body!), early morning court times (unless you're a morning person!), and finding a court that isn't perpetually booked solid.
*   **Pottery:** Getting your hands dirty and creating something beautiful (or wonderfully wonky!) from a lump of clay. Think Zen, creativity, and bragging rights when you finally nail that perfect coffee mug.

    *   **Pros:** Stress relief, creative outlet, tangible results (you made *that*!), improved dexterity, and the chance to unleash your inner sculptor.
    *   **Cons:** Can be messy (embrace the clay!), requires a bit of patience (Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a decent vase!), and finding a studio with space and equipment.

Honestly, choosing is like picking your favorite child. Both offer incredible benefits for your physical and mental well-being.

But here’s the thing: Are you *really* ready for retirement? Hobby is just the start, there's also the financial considerations. You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. [You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.](https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb)

Maybe the key isn’t choosing one over the other. Maybe it’s about finding what sparks joy, gets you moving, and keeps you laughing. After all, isn't *that* what truly keeps you young(er)? Maybe it's both! A pickleball game followed by a pottery session. The possibilities are endless. What's your plan?

1oq403y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1oq403y/aer_travel_pack_2_review/,Aer Travel Pack 2 Review,"**Update: The Travel Pack 2 has been replaced by the Travel Pack 3 ($249), which addresses some issues I mention below—mainly adding load lifters and slightly more capacity. But if you find a Travel Pack 2 on sale, this review still holds.**

I'll cut to the chase: The Aer Travel Pack 2 is really good, but it's not perfect. And honestly? I'm tired of reviews that pretend every $230 backpack is flawless.

After using this bag for three months—including a two-week trip through Portugal and countless coffee shop sessions in San Francisco—I've developed complicated feelings about it. It's beautifully designed and built like a tank, but some choices genuinely confused me. The infamous shoe compartment. The noisy zippers that announced my 6 AM hostel exits. The compression straps that made me curse every single time I needed something from the main compartment.

But here's the thing: despite these annoyances, I kept reaching for it.

# What Makes the Aer Travel Pack 2 Special

Let me start with what Aer absolutely nailed.

**The materials are legitimately impressive.** The 1680D Cordura ballistic nylon feels absurdly durable—like you could drag this thing behind a motorcycle and it'd probably survive. After three months, mine still looks brand new. No scuffs, no fraying, nothing. This bag laughs at airport conveyor belts.

The YKK Aquaguard zippers on the laptop compartment actually kept my MacBook dry when I got caught in a surprise downpour in Lisbon. Not all the zippers have this coating (more on that later), but the ones that do work brilliantly.

**The aesthetic is pure San Francisco minimalism.** Black-on-black everything. No logos screaming for attention. Just clean lines and that distinctive ballistic nylon texture that somehow looks both technical and sophisticated. I've carried this bag to client meetings and weekend hikes without feeling out of place either time.

The internal frame deserves special mention. Unlike floppy bags that collapse into sad puddles when empty, the Travel Pack 2 stands up on its own. This sounds trivial until you're frantically repacking in an Airbnb and need both hands free.

**Organization is thoughtful** (maybe too thoughtful—we'll get to that). The quick-access top pocket became my go-to for boarding passes and snacks. The laptop compartment opens separately from the main bag, which made airport security noticeably faster. The admin pocket in front swallowed my chargers, cables, and travel adapter without turning into the usual tangled mess.

When I packed for Portugal—7 days, one bag—everything fit: 4 shirts, 2 pants, underwear for a week, toiletries, laptop, camera, and a light jacket. The clamshell opening made packing feel less like Tetris and more like actual organization.

# Where It Falls Short (And Why That Matters)

Now for the honest part most reviews gloss over.

**The shoe compartment is a genuinely baffling design choice.** It's huge—big enough for men's size 13 boots—and when you use it, it eats roughly half your main compartment space. I tried packing it with shoes once and immediately regretted it because suddenly my packing cubes didn't fit properly.

Yes, you can roll it up when not in use. But why is it this massive in a 33-liter bag? It feels like Aer designed this compartment for a 45L pack and forgot to scale it down. Reddit's r/onebag community has ranted about this extensively, and I finally understand why.

**The missing load lifters bothered me more than I expected.** Aer removed them from the original Travel Pack, presumably to simplify the design. But when this bag is fully loaded (it weighs 3.7 pounds empty, remember), that weight pulls away from your back. My shoulders felt it after an hour of walking through Porto's hills.

The Travel Pack 3 added load lifters back. That should tell you something.

**Those compression straps everyone raves about? They're a double-edged sword.** Yes, they look sleek and compress the bag beautifully. But they cross directly over the main clamshell zipper. Every. Single. Time. You want something from the main compartment, you have to unbuckle all four straps. In an airport. With people behind you. It's the definition of a first-world problem, but it's also genuinely annoying.

**The zippers are noisy.** Like, really noisy. The matte black coating that looks so good also creates this distinctive metallic *zing* sound every time you open anything. My hostel roommates definitely heard me packing at 5 AM for an early flight. I eventually put heat-shrink tubing on the zipper pulls just to quiet them down.

The water bottle pocket is tight. My 21oz Hydroflask fit, but barely. Larger bottles need actual muscle to wedge in. And without the compression strap looped around it, the bottle can slide out if you're not careful.

**Here's the controversial take: it's heavy for 33 liters.** At 3.7 pounds empty, it weighs more than some 40L bags. The Minaal Carry-on 2.0 is lighter. Peak Design's 45L Travel Backpack is only slightly heavier. That ballistic nylon and extra organization come with a weight penalty that matters on weight-restricted budget airlines.

The front organizational pockets have zero depth. They're flat. When the bag is packed, you literally can't get your hand inside them. They become decorative. This frustrated me because the quick-access top pocket gets cramped fast, and I wanted those front pockets to actually be usable.

# The Value Question: Is It Worth $230?

This is where it gets tricky.

The Aer Travel Pack 2 originally cost $230. It's now discontinued (replaced by the $249 Travel Pack 3), but you can still find it on the secondary market for $150-$200. At that price? Absolutely worth considering.

At the original $230? It depends entirely on what you value.

**You're paying for:**

* Materials that will outlast most bags by years
* A design that won't embarrass you in professional settings
* Organization features that tech workers genuinely need
* The confidence that this thing won't fail mid-trip

**You're not getting:**

* The lightest 33L option
* Perfect ergonomics for heavy loads
* Pockets that all remain functional when packed
* A design that works equally well for minimalists and gear-heavy travelers

The Peak Design Travel Backpack costs about the same but offers more capacity (35-45L expandable). The Tortuga Outbreaker gives you better organization at a similar price. The Minaal Carry-on 2.0 weighs less and holds more actual gear.

But none of them *feel* as premium as the Aer. That ballistic nylon, the perfectly aligned seams, the attention to detail—there's a quality here that's hard to quantify but impossible to miss.

# Who Should Buy This Bag (And Who Shouldn't)

**Buy the Travel Pack 2 if you:**

* Carry a laptop and tech gear regularly (the organization shines here)
* Value aesthetics and build quality over weight savings
* Take 3-7 day trips where 33L is genuinely enough
* Want a bag that transitions between work and weekend travel
* Are okay with some quirks in exchange for durability
* Pack light or use packing cubes religiously

**Skip it if you:**

* Need maximum capacity for the weight you're carrying
* Take longer trips requiring more than a week's clothing
* Want a hiking-style backpack with advanced suspension
* Prioritize simplicity over organization
* Need every pocket to stay functional when packed full
* Prefer lighter materials like X-Pac or ripstop nylon

**Definitely skip it if:**

* You only carry minimal gear (this bag is organizational overkill)
* You're on a tight budget (there are good bags for less)
* You need to pack shoes plus a week+ of clothes
* You want silent zippers for hostel life

# The Alternatives Worth Considering

**If you want more space:** Peak Design Travel Backpack (45L) or Nomatic Travel Bag (40L) give you breathing room without much added bulk.

**If you want less weight:** Minaal Carry-on 2.0 is lighter while holding more actual gear. Osprey Farpoint/Fairview prioritizes comfort over aesthetics.

**If you want similar style for less:** The Incase EO Travel Backpack offers comparable organization at a lower price point, though materials aren't quite as premium.

**If you're buying new anyway:** Get the Travel Pack 3 instead. Aer fixed the load lifter issue and added slightly more capacity. It's $19 more but addresses real problems.

# Practical Details That Matter

**Dimensions:** 21.5"" x 13.5"" x 8.5"" (33L)  
**Weight:** 3.7 pounds empty  
**Laptop fit:** Up to 15.6"" (plenty of room for most laptops)  
**Carry-on compatible:** Yes, on most airlines. Budget European carriers *might* flag it, but the bag squishes easily enough that I never had issues.

**What actually fits:** For a week-long trip, I comfortably packed:

* 4 t-shirts, 2 button-downs
* 2 pairs of pants
* 7 days underwear/socks
* Light jacket
* Toiletries in a small dopp kit
* 15"" laptop
* Camera (mirrorless)
* Chargers, cables, travel adapter
* Book

Room to spare? Not really. But it worked without overstuffing.

# The Bottom Line

The Aer Travel Pack 2 is a beautifully made bag with some genuinely frustrating design choices. It's perfect for the tech-focused urban traveler who values aesthetics and organization over lightweight efficiency. It's frustrating for anyone who wants straightforward simplicity or needs maximum capacity.

I kept using it because the materials are exceptional, the style is on point, and when I'm packing light for 3-5 days, it just *works*. But I won't pretend the shoe compartment makes sense, the weight is ideal, or those compression straps don't occasionally make me want to throw the bag across the room.

At secondary market prices ($150-$200), it's a solid value. At the original $230, you need to really value what Aer does well to justify the premium.

**My rating: 4 out of 5 stars.** It's a very good bag with some annoying flaws. Not perfect, but genuinely excellent at what it's designed to do.

**Should you buy it?** If you found this review searching for honest opinions instead of another ""perfect bag"" puff piece, you probably appreciate the same things I do about gear. So here's my honest advice: If the Travel Pack 3 is in your budget, get that instead—it's the bag this should have been. If you find a used Travel Pack 2 for under $200 and you pack light, grab it. Otherwise, shop around. There are great bags at every price point, and the ""perfect"" travel pack doesn't exist.

What matters is finding the one whose flaws you can live with. For me, the Travel Pack 2's strengths outweighed its annoyances. But your mileage may vary.

When is enough, enough?","Let me begin by saying that I love my (40F) spouse very much. She is incredibly caring and thoughtful, and I married her because of who she is. We had minor differences, but I'd really consider her my best friend.

However, I am beginning to quickly lose my patience. I find that my mental health is beginning to suffer at home since I never feel ""at peace."" I believe home should be a comfortable, relaxing place that allows you to take down all your walls and feel vulnerable. While maintaining a home requires work and upkeep, I find that I am constantly cleaning up after my spouse or undoing her ""projects."" I've pleaded with her to be more attentive and thoughtful about our home, but it goes on deaf ears. I am struggling because I feel like a massive asshole wanting to have a well-kept house. I've tried to ""relax,"" but I always feel on edge.

The types of things I'm talking about: Gets a cup of coffee, spills on the counter, leaves the mess. Leaves wrappers on the counter. Takes the empty toilet paper roll off, leaves on the sink counter, doesn't touch it for four days. Leaves garbage wrappers outside so they blow around the yard. Drops items on the floor and leaves them. Spills laundry detergent and doesn't clean it up. Leaves dryer sheets on the floor. Throws pajamas or other dirty clothes on the bedroom floor. Leaves cabinets or drawers open. Stuffs ""throwaway drawers"" full of things until they don't close.

More than this, my spouse has been doing home projects inside and outside. Drilling holes in walls, tearing up the landscaping. She dismantled a wall outside to use the stones for another project, leaving the wall appearing that it's fallen apart. It's just... chaotic.

No matter how hard I try, I stress about all this. I feel like our home is in a constant state of disarray. I am always cleaning up after her, closing drawers, closing cabinets, picking up things off the floor, reorganizing drawers. I want to come home and want to do some light cleaning and read a book to relax, but I get home and find that I have to clean up a bunch of messes that accumulated while I was gone.

I am so mentally stressed from this that I am wondering if I can just not be married to anyone, period. Is this just part of being married to someone, that you deal with these annoyances?

I live in a converted apartment in NYC.  The original living room was partitioned into a bedroom and a smaller living room, so the resulting living room doesn't have windows (see floor plan).  Right now, I fear it looks like a hodge-podge of random stuff.  I am willing to paint or replace furniture that isn't the couch or the entertainment unit table.  I have the following ideas and would like to be told what to purchase:

* Pillows for couch
* some kind of decoration for coffee table (basket for throw blanket? TV tray? idk. I'm also open to spray painting it)
* mirror in center of wall where coatrack is (you can see the lone coat rack I hung up, lol)
* Folding card table I can hang on hook underneath mirror
* different rug, not a fan of the color/pattern
* something above the TV? maybe a shelf I can put books on or some artwork
* painting side table between couch and chair?

""My wife,"" he finally clarified, the word sounding like an inconvenience. ""She's old-fashioned. Doesn't understand how things work in our world."" I stood, my legs trembling beneath me. ""Julian, it's nearly three in the morning."" ""Is it?"" He checked his Rolex with exaggerated movements. ""Time flies when you're actually enjoying yourself, Charlotte."" The model snickered, swaying against him. The city lights through our floor-to-ceiling windows caught the diamond pendant nestled between her collarbones—identical to the one Julian had given me for our anniversary three months ago. ""I think you should leave,"" I said to her, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. Julian's eyes narrowed. ""She stays. This is my house, bought with my money."" ""Our home,"" I corrected, though the word felt hollow now. He laughed, the sound cutting through me like shattered glass. ""Go to bed, Charlotte. Or don't. We'll be in the guest room."" I watched them stumble down the hallway, her whispers and his low chuckles echoing off the marble floors. I didn't cry. That well had run dry months ago. --- Morning light streamed through the windows, harsh and unforgiving. Julian had left early—a meeting in Midtown, according to the terse note on the counter. The model was gone too, leaving behind only the faint scent of an unfamiliar perfume. I made coffee, my movements mechanical. When Julian's phone buzzed on the kitchen island, I shouldn't have looked. But something in me needed the confirmation, needed to see the truth I'd been avoiding. The notification preview showed just enough: *Savannah Moore: Can't wait for this weekend. My place this time? Less complicated than...* His executive assistant. Of course. I unlocked his phone—he'd never bothered changing the code, so confident was he in my submission—and scrolled through dozens of messages between them. Pet names. Plans. Photos I immediately wished I could unsee. Savannah wasn't just another fling. This had been going on for months, right under my nose. At company events where I'd smiled politely at her. During late nights at the office he'd claimed were unavoidable. I set the phone down, hands shaking. The diamond wedding ring on my finger caught the light, mocking me with its empty promises. I'd tried so hard—therapy appointments Julian never showed up for, weekend getaways he canceled last-minute, desperate attempts to recapture what we'd once had. That night, he returned home sober and immaculate in his tailored suit. I'd prepared dinner—a peace offering, a last attempt. ""We need to talk,"" I said as he loosened his tie. Julian sighed, impatient. ""About what? Last night? Don't be dramatic, Charlotte."" ""About us. About what's left of our marriage."" He studied me for a moment, then reached for his wine glass. ""I've been thinking about that, actually. I think we should consider an open marriage."" The words hit me like a physical blow. ""What?"" ""It's the modern solution,"" he continued, casual as if discussing stock options. ""You get the security you crave, I get my freedom. Everyone wins."" ""That's not a marriage,"" I whispered. Julian's expression hardened. ""It's all I'm offering. Take it or leave it, Charlotte."" His smile turned cruel. ""Though we both know you have nowhere else to go."" He stood, conversation finished in his mind, and walked toward the guest bedroom without waiting for my response. I watched his silhouette disappear down the hallway, the set of his shoulders radiating absolute certainty in his control over me. In that moment, something inside me—something I thought Julian had crushed years ago—quietly stirred to life. He was right about one thing: I had nowhere to go. But that was about to change.

After getting back from my knee replacement on Monday. I can come home to a clean house that I cleaned the day before my surgery. And now I'm just sitting on my couch alone and have the freedom to do whatever I want. No one telling me what kind of things I can't do.

I even started walking without my crutch. I feel so relaxed. I do my exercises in my own time. I was able to do some dishes because I meal prepping everything before my surgery and I just need to use a little bit of dishes. 

I want to order some coffee and spoil myself so I can some treats today. 

I'm still sore, but I'm so relieved and relaxed. I don't have to talk to anyone about how I feel or make them worried about my life. I have the freedom to do whatever and whenever I want even though I'm not completely independent right now.

I am happy that I got my surgery the pain of recovery is the same as I was before the surgery. But better. Because the discomfort and the amount of pain is less now after the surgery.

People told me all this horror stories after the surgery. I feel different and I feel so much better. 

The part of living alone and have the freedom to do whatever I want is such a good thing. Today I even thought about if I have someone in my life, I will feel so bad and I don't want to be their burden because I like my independent. And how strong an individual I am because I can conquer all the tough times in my life on my own. I got a little help from friends.

1oq3pqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oq3pqb/best_vpns_for_ukraine/,Best VPNs for Ukraine,"**Ukraine faces unprecedented cyber threats in 2025.** According to Microsoft's Digital Defense Report, Ukraine ranks **5th globally** among countries most impacted by cyber activity, accounting for approximately 9.5% of affected customers in Europe. The country's State Service for Special Communications reported a staggering **70% increase** in cyberattacks during 2024, with over **3,018 incidents** recorded in just the first half of 2025 alone.

For Ukrainian citizens—whether at home or abroad—a Virtual Private Network (VPN) has become an essential security tool, not a luxury. With Russian-backed hackers deploying AI-powered phishing campaigns, sophisticated malware, and coordinated attacks on critical infrastructure, protecting your online privacy and security is more critical than ever.

This comprehensive guide examines the best VPNs for Ukraine in 2025, backed by extensive testing, expert analysis, and real-world performance data.

# Why Ukraine Needs VPNs More Than Ever

# The Current Threat Landscape

Ukraine's cyber environment has transformed dramatically since 2022. **State-sponsored threat actors** including APT28, Sandworm (UAC-0002), and UAC-0219 actively target Ukrainian government agencies, military installations, energy infrastructure, and civilians with increasingly sophisticated attacks.

Recent threats include:

* **AI-powered cyberattacks**: Russian hackers now use artificial intelligence to generate convincing phishing messages and malware that's harder to detect
* **Zero-click exploits**: Attacks targeting Roundcube and Zimbra email platforms that don't require user interaction
* **Data exfiltration**: Coordinated campaigns stealing credentials, contacts, and sensitive information through compromised APIs
* **DDoS attacks**: Overwhelming critical websites and services to disrupt essential operations
* **Surveillance**: Increased monitoring of internet activity by both hostile actors and domestic intelligence services

# Internet Censorship in Ukraine

While VPNs are **completely legal in Ukraine**, the government has implemented website blocks for national security reasons. Currently, **577+ websites** are blocked, including:

* **Russian social media**: VKontakte, Odnoklassniki (blocked since 2017)
* **Russian services**: Yandex search engine, Mail .ru email service
* **Pro-Russian streaming platforms**: Ivi, Okko, Kion, and hundreds of pirate sites
* **Certain news outlets**: Sites deemed to spread propaganda or disinformation

For Ukrainians with family connections in Russia or those needing access to these platforms for legitimate reasons, a VPN provides secure access while maintaining privacy.

# Real-World Consequences Without VPN Protection

**Without a VPN, Ukrainian internet users face:**

* **Identity theft** from hackers intercepting unencrypted connections on public Wi-Fi
* **Banking fraud** when accessing financial accounts over unsecured networks
* **Surveillance** of online activities, browsing history, and communications
* **Data breaches** exposing personal information to malicious actors
* **Geo-restrictions** preventing access to Ukrainian services while traveling abroad
* **ISP throttling** slowing down specific types of internet traffic

# Essential VPN Features for Ukraine Users

Not all VPNs offer adequate protection for the Ukrainian threat environment. When selecting a VPN for use in or from Ukraine, prioritize these critical features:

# Military-Grade Security

**AES-256 encryption** is non-negotiable. This encryption standard, used by governments and militaries worldwide, ensures your data remains unreadable even if intercepted. Look for VPNs that also implement **Perfect Forward Secrecy**, which generates unique encryption keys for each session.

# Kill Switch Protection

A **kill switch** immediately cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops unexpectedly. This prevents your real IP address and data from being exposed during connection failures—critical protection when facing state-sponsored surveillance or attacks.

# Verified No-Logs Policy

Choose VPNs with **independently audited no-logs policies**. This ensures the VPN provider doesn't store your browsing history, connection logs, or any data that could be seized or demanded by authorities.

# DNS and IP Leak Protection

**DNS leaks** can reveal your browsing activity even when connected to a VPN. Premium VPNs include leak protection that routes all DNS queries through their encrypted tunnel, preventing inadvertent data exposure.

# Fast, Reliable Connections

With Ukraine's average internet speeds ranging from 25-60 Mbps on mobile and fixed broadband, you need a VPN that minimizes speed loss. The best VPNs reduce speeds by less than 20%, allowing you to stream in HD, video conference, and browse without frustrating lag.

# Ukrainian Server Access

Whether you're abroad and need to access Ukrainian banking apps, stream STB or 1+1 content, or maintain a Ukrainian IP address, **servers in Kyiv** are essential.

# Best VPNs for Ukraine in 2025

After testing over 25 VPN services across multiple devices, locations, and use cases, these five providers emerged as the most reliable options for Ukrainian users.

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall for Ukraine

**NordVPN dominates as the top choice for Ukrainian users in 2025**, offering the perfect balance of security, speed, and Ukrainian infrastructure.

**Key Features:**

* **14+ high-speed servers in Kyiv** for reliable Ukrainian IP addresses
* **8,300+ global servers** across 126 countries for international access
* **NordLynx protocol** delivering speeds up to **820 Mbps**
* **Threat Protection Pro** blocking malware, ads, and trackers in real-time
* **Double VPN** routing traffic through two servers for enhanced anonymity
* **Independently audited no-logs policy** by Deloitte (2025)
* **RAM-only servers** that automatically wipe all data

**Ukraine-Specific Advantages:**

NordVPN's Ukrainian servers consistently delivered excellent performance in our tests, with average speeds of 177 Mbps on a 220 Mbps connection. The service successfully unblocked popular Ukrainian platforms including Megogo, 1+1, ICTV, and STB.

**Security Features:**

NordVPN's **Threat Protection Pro** is particularly valuable in Ukraine's threat environment. It scans downloaded files for malware, blocks dangerous websites before they load, and prevents tracker surveillance—all working even when the VPN isn't connected.

The **kill switch** operates at both system-wide and app-specific levels, giving you granular control over which applications disconnect if VPN protection fails.

**For Ukrainian Journalists:**

NordVPN provides **free emergency VPN services for journalists** for one month (extendable). Contact their 24/7 customer support to apply.

**Pricing:** Starting at $3.69/month (2-year plan)  
**Money-Back Guarantee:** 30 days  
**Simultaneous Connections:** Up to 10 devices

# 2. ExpressVPN - Best for Speed and Reliability

**ExpressVPN** remains the gold standard for users who prioritize maximum speed and reliability, with excellent performance in Ukraine.

**Key Features:**

* **Servers in Kyiv** plus 3,000+ locations across 105 countries
* **Lightway protocol** delivering speeds exceeding **223 Mbps** with minimal battery drain
* **TrustedServer technology** using RAM-only servers that never write data to disk
* **Automatic obfuscation** on all servers to prevent VPN detection
* **Threat Manager** blocking apps from communicating with malicious domains
* **Smart Location** automatically connects to the fastest available server

**Why It's Ideal for Ukraine:**

ExpressVPN's Lightway protocol proved remarkably efficient in our Ukraine tests, maintaining 97% of baseline connection speeds. On a 227 Mbps connection, we averaged 223 Mbps through ExpressVPN's Kyiv server—virtually imperceptible slowdown.

The service excels at **unblocking international content** while in Ukraine, seamlessly accessing Netflix US/UK, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and other geo-restricted platforms.

**Security Highlights:**

ExpressVPN combines **AES-256 encryption** with a **4096-bit RSA key** for exceptional security. Their TrustedServer technology means every server reboot completely erases all data, making it impossible for attackers to extract historical information even if servers were physically compromised.

**Pricing:** Starting at $6.67/month (annual plan + 3 free months)  
**Money-Back Guarantee:** 30 days  
**Simultaneous Connections:** 8 devices

# 3. Surfshark - Best Budget Option with Unlimited Devices

For families or users on tight budgets, **Surfshark** delivers premium protection at remarkable value.

**Key Features:**

* **Servers in Ukraine** plus 3,200+ globally across 100 countries
* **Unlimited simultaneous connections** on a single account
* **CleanWeb** blocking ads, trackers, and malware
* **WireGuard protocol** achieving speeds over **800 Mbps** in testing
* **RAM-only servers** with automatic data wiping
* **Camouflage Mode** hiding VPN usage from ISPs
* **No-logs policy** independently audited

**Value Proposition:**

At just $2.19/month for a 2-year subscription, Surfshark costs less than a coffee while protecting unlimited devices. This makes it ideal for **Ukrainian families** wanting to secure all smartphones, tablets, laptops, and smart TVs under one account.

**Performance:**

Surfshark outpaced both NordVPN and ExpressVPN in raw speed tests on US servers, consistently delivering 800+ Mbps. Ukrainian servers also performed excellently, providing stable, fast connections for local content access.

**For Ukrainian Journalists:**

Like NordVPN, Surfshark offers **free VPN services for journalists**. Contact their support team to apply for the program.

**Pricing:** Starting at $2.19/month (2-year plan)  
**Money-Back Guarantee:** 30 days  
**Simultaneous Connections:** Unlimited

# 4. CyberGhost - Best for Beginners

**CyberGhost** combines powerful security with exceptional user-friendliness, making it perfect for VPN newcomers.

**Key Features:**

* **9,000+ servers** across 90+ countries, including Ukraine
* **Intuitive apps** with one-click connection across all platforms
* **Automatic Wi-Fi protection** enabling VPN on public networks
* **NoSpy servers** in Romania for enhanced privacy
* **Ad blocking** and malware protection included
* **45-day money-back guarantee** (longest in the industry)

**Ease of Use:**

CyberGhost's interface uses visual icons and plain language, eliminating technical jargon. Even absolute beginners can select ""streaming,"" ""torrenting,"" or ""browsing"" optimized servers without understanding the underlying technology.

**Security:**

Despite its beginner focus, CyberGhost doesn't compromise security. **AES-256 encryption**, a verified no-logs policy, automatic kill switch, and DNS leak protection come standard. The Romanian-based NoSpy servers offer additional privacy, as they're operated exclusively by CyberGhost staff.

**Pricing:** Starting at $2.11/month (2-year plan)  
**Money-Back Guarantee:** 45 days  
**Simultaneous Connections:** 7 devices

# 5. ProtonVPN - Best Free Option

For users who absolutely cannot afford paid VPNs, **ProtonVPN's free tier** offers legitimate protection.

**Key Features (Free Tier):**

* **Unlimited data** (no monthly caps)
* **Servers in 3 countries** (Netherlands, Japan, Romania)
* **Strong encryption** and verified no-logs policy
* **No ads** or data selling
* **Medium speed** (sufficient for browsing, email)

**Important Note:** ProtonVPN's free tier does **NOT include Ukrainian servers**. You'll need ProtonVPN Plus ($3.59/month) to access Ukraine's 60+ servers and achieve faster speeds.

**When to Use Free vs. Paid:**

ProtonVPN's free tier works well for:

* Basic browsing and email protection
* Securing public Wi-Fi connections
* Light streaming (with buffering)

However, for Ukrainian-specific needs—accessing local banking, streaming Ukrainian content abroad, or maximum speed—upgrading to a paid VPN is essential.

# How to Set Up Your VPN in Ukraine

Follow these steps for optimal security:

# Step 1: Choose and Purchase Your VPN

Select a VPN from our recommended list. All offer money-back guarantees, letting you test risk-free.

# Step 2: Download and Install

Visit the VPN provider's official website (never download from third-party sites) and download the app for your device(s). Installation typically takes 2-3 minutes.

# Step 3: Configure Security Settings

Before connecting, enable these critical features:

1. **Kill Switch**: Prevents data leaks if VPN disconnects
2. **DNS Leak Protection**: Routes all DNS queries through VPN
3. **Protocol Selection**: Choose WireGuard/NordLynx for optimal speed and security
4. **Auto-Connect**: Automatically enables VPN when you go online

# Step 4: Select Your Server

* **For Ukrainian IP**: Connect to Kyiv servers
* **For accessing blocked content**: Connect to servers in countries where content is available (typically UK, US, Netherlands)
* **For maximum security**: Use Double VPN or obfuscated servers (NordVPN, Surfshark)

# Step 5: Verify Your Connection

Test your VPN is working properly:

1. Visit ipleak to check for DNS/IP leaks
2. Verify your displayed IP matches your VPN server location
3. Ensure no WebRTC leaks appear
4. Test speeds at speedtest

**Expected Speed Loss:** 10-20% is normal; more than 50% indicates problems

# Step 6: Test Access

Try accessing a previously blocked website or Ukrainian service to confirm everything works correctly.

# Staying Safe Online in Ukraine Beyond VPNs

A VPN is your foundation, but comprehensive security requires additional measures:

# Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**MFA blocks over 99% of account takeover attempts.** Enable it on all critical accounts: email, banking, social media, and government portals. Use authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) rather than SMS when possible.

# Keep Software Updated

**Unpatched vulnerabilities** are prime attack vectors. Enable automatic updates for:

* Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
* Web browsers
* Antivirus/anti-malware
* All installed applications

The APT28 attacks on Ukraine specifically exploited outdated email clients with known vulnerabilities.

# Recognize Phishing Attempts

**AI-powered phishing** is now highly sophisticated. Be suspicious of:

* Urgent requests for account credentials or financial information
* Unexpected attachments, even from known contacts
* Links that don't match displayed URLs (hover to check)
* Messages with unusual grammar, spelling, or tone
* Requests to disable security features

**Never enter credentials after clicking email links**—instead, manually type the website address.

# Use Encrypted Messaging

For sensitive communications, use **end-to-end encrypted** apps:

* **Signal** (most secure, open-source)
* **Telegram** (popular in Ukraine, but less secure than Signal)
* **WhatsApp** (encrypted but owned by Meta)

Avoid SMS, regular email, and social media DMs for confidential discussions.

# Backup Critical Data

Regular backups protect against **ransomware and destructive attacks**. Follow the **3-2-1 rule**:

* **3 copies** of important data
* **2 different storage types** (external drive + cloud)
* **1 copy off-site** (cloud storage or remote location)

Test your backups periodically to ensure they're accessible when needed.

# Secure Your Home Network

* **Change default router password** (attackers know factory settings)
* **Enable WPA3 encryption** on Wi-Fi (or WPA2 minimum)
* **Disable WPS** (Wi-Fi Protected Setup—insecure)
* **Hide SSID broadcast** (makes network less visible)
* **Create guest network** for visitors and IoT devices

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Are VPNs legal in Ukraine?

**Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Ukraine.** There are no restrictions on VPN usage, and many Ukrainian citizens, businesses, and government workers rely on VPNs for security. However, using a VPN to engage in illegal activities remains prohibited.

# Will a VPN slow down my internet?

**Premium VPNs typically reduce speeds by 10-20%**—often imperceptible in daily use. Budget and free VPNs may cause 50%+ slowdown. Our testing showed:

* **NordVPN**: 15% average speed reduction
* **ExpressVPN**: 2% average speed reduction
* **Surfshark**: 10% average speed reduction

Speed impact depends on server distance, encryption protocol, and current server load.

# Can I access VKontakte with a VPN?

**Yes.** VKontakte has been blocked in Ukraine since 2017, but connecting to a VPN server in Russia or other countries where VK is accessible bypasses the restriction. This is legal, though the Ukrainian government discourages it due to security concerns about Russian platforms.

# Do free VPNs work in Ukraine?

**Most free VPNs are dangerous** and should be avoided. They often:

* Sell your browsing data to advertisers
* Inject ads and trackers
* Provide weak or no encryption
* Have severe speed and data caps
* Contain malware

**Only ProtonVPN's free tier is trustworthy**, but it lacks Ukrainian servers and has limited speeds. For Ukrainian-specific needs, paid VPNs are essential.

# Which VPN is best for Ukrainian journalists?

**NordVPN and Surfshark** both offer **free emergency VPN services for journalists** covering the war or working under threat. Contact their support teams to apply. ExpressVPN also provides excellent security for source protection with its TrustedServer technology.

# Can a VPN protect me from cyberattacks?

**A VPN provides critical protection but isn't a complete solution.** VPNs:

✅ **Encrypt your connection**, preventing interception  
✅ **Hide your IP address**, reducing targeting  
✅ **Block malicious websites** (with threat protection features)  
✅ **Secure public Wi-Fi** against eavesdropping

❌ **Don't protect against**: Phishing if you enter credentials, malware from downloads, social engineering, or already-compromised devices

Combine your VPN with antivirus software, regular updates, and security awareness.

# Will Ukrainian banks block my VPN?

**Some Ukrainian banks may flag VPN connections as suspicious**, particularly from foreign IPs. If you encounter access issues:

1. **Connect to Ukrainian servers** (Kyiv) for local IP
2. **Contact bank support** to whitelist VPN usage
3. **Temporarily disable VPN** for transactions, then re-enable
4. **Use dedicated IP** feature (available with NordVPN, CyberGhost)

Most modern banks accommodate VPN users, recognizing their security benefits.

# Conclusion: Take Action to Protect Yourself Today

**The cyber threats facing Ukraine are real, persistent, and evolving.** With a 70% increase in attacks, AI-powered malware, and state-sponsored hackers specifically targeting Ukrainian citizens, infrastructure, and organizations, securing your online presence is no longer optional—it's essential.

**A quality VPN provides:**

* Military-grade encryption protecting your data from interception
* Privacy from surveillance by hostile actors and excessive monitoring
* Access to blocked websites while maintaining security
* Safe connections on vulnerable public Wi-Fi networks
* The ability to access Ukrainian services while traveling abroad

Based on comprehensive testing and analysis, **NordVPN** emerges as the best overall choice for Ukrainian users in 2025. Its combination of 14+ Kyiv servers, cutting-edge security features, blazing-fast NordLynx protocol, and commitment to Ukrainian journalists makes it ideally suited to the country's unique needs.

However, **ExpressVPN**, **Surfshark**, and **CyberGhost** all offer excellent alternatives depending on your priorities—whether that's maximum speed, budget considerations, or ease of use.

**Don't wait until you're targeted.** Ukraine's Security Service has already repelled over 2,300 cyberattacks in 2025 alone, and countless more attacks target individual citizens daily. The formation of Ukraine's dedicated Cyber Force underscores how seriously the nation takes these threats—you should too.

**Choose a VPN today, enable it on all your devices, and take the first critical step toward protecting your digital life in these uncertain times.**

I moved to NYC 11 months ago and to the states 5 years ago from India. I’m outgoing and assimilated myself with the US culture, but I find it hard to make friends in NYC. I’m 32. The past 2 days had me crying in a fetal position because of loneliness. 

I had an abusive childhood and have abandonment issues. My mom was verbally, emotionally and mentally abusive. She has become better ever since my dad passed away. He was a raging abusive alcoholic. Yay me! But my mom is emotionally unavailable. And my younger sister is kind and cares about me but we don’t have anything in common and she is emotionally unavailable too, maybe a trauma response from what our dad put us through. My mom and sister live in India. I just don’t have anybody to talk to when something nice happens or when shit hits the fan. I have acquaintances in NYC and friends but I’m not close enough with them. I feel rejected when they post stories with other common friends. I know they are nice people and know each other better but I can’t help but feel unwanted. I reach out to them for coffee or doing things and sometimes they oblige but I wish I had people reach out to me to hangout.

I’ve been told that I’m attractive and funny but I’m single AF. I have had casual relationships (out of loneliness) in NYC but realized that I get emotionally invested and now refrain from them. I have lost motivation to do anything or enjoy anything. Therapy will help but I just feel so defeated. My career is the only thing that’s keeping me afloat (knock on wood).

**TL;DR:**  
[Journiv](https://journiv.com/) is a a beautiful, self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights. The mission is simple: **your memories should always stay yours.** Own them, don’t rent them.

Journiv 0.1.0-beta.3 is now live on [GitHub](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app) and fully [Docker-hostable](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-compose-recommended).  
Start owning your thoughts and memories forever and keep them completely private.

[Demo](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app?tab=readme-ov-file#-journiv---private-journal) video available on the github readme(*Please ignore any small differences in the UI between the screenshots and the video. The interface is still evolving, and setting up demo data for every capture is a bit too much work right now.*)



**AudioBookShelf Integration Brainstorming: What Would You Love to See?**

I recently got a lot of great feedback from the [Immich community](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1onj6ay/journiv_011beta_is_out_a_selfhosted_privacyfirst/) about integrating Journiv with Immich, and I’m now looking for similar feedback from the Audiobookshelf community. Currently, I feel the integration between self hosted app are non-existent leaving a huge gap in e2e experience among products. It will be nice to bridge this.

I do use Audiobookshelf myself, but my usage is limited (between kids and side projects), so I’d love to hear ideas from others who use it more extensively.

Here are a few ideas so far:

**Reflect Back:**  
Something I personally want. When I finish an audiobook, I often wish I could quickly jot down my thoughts: what I liked, what resonated, what I learned. Journiv could show a prompt right after finishing a book (I believe this is possible periodically pulling metadata from APIs), making it easy to capture reflections without having to remember later.

**On This Day:**  
Journiv already includes an “On This Day” feature. It could be extended to Audiobookshelf, showing that “1 year ago you finished this book,” and if a reflection or journal entry was written then, displaying what you wrote.

There are many other possibilities similar to the [Immich integration](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/issues/34), but since my Audiobookshelf usage is limited, I’d love input from the community:

* Would an integration between Audiobookshelf and Journiv be valuable to you?
* What kind of integration or workflows would you find most useful?
* Are there any other ideas or use cases you’d like to see supported?

**The Story Behind Journiv**

I got a home server last year and went deep in self hosting rabbit hole. While exploring options journaling solution, I realized there wasn’t a truly modern, self-hosted equivalent to Day One or Apple Journal. Most alternatives were either general note apps or old abandoned projects.

I wanted something focused on journaling with:

* “On This Day” memories
* Prompt-based journaling
* A clean, minimal, distraction-free writing experience

So… I built my own: [Journiv](https://journiv.com/), a beautiful (at least I am trying to make it so), self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights.

**Tech Stack**

* **Backend:** Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
* **Frontend:** Flutter (web + mobile)

**Features**

* Clean, minimal writing interface
* ""On This Day” view
* Prompt-based journaling
* Mood tracking
* Multiple journals and tags
* Full-text search
* Insights & analytics
* Light / Dark mode
* Media gallery with full-quality uploads
* Export & share entries

For setup instructions check the [README](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.

**Coming Soon**

* OIDC support (releasing very soon)
* Native iOS and Android apps (since the frontend is flutter it is ready but I need to figure out process and legalities of launching an app on App Store and Play Store)
* More refined UI / UX (as I level up in Flutter)
* Day One Import
* Quick audio notes (with transcription)
* Apple Journaling Suggestions integration
* Weather & health metadata
* Location tagging (map view)
* Immich integration
* Strava integration
* …and your next feature request!

**Get Involved**

Give Journiv a try, share your feedback and report [issues](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/issues). It means a lot at this stage.  
Together, let’s make personal journaling truly personal again.

What are some pedestrian friendly cities in China with good urban life? What I mean by pedestrian friendly is that walking around randomly from one part of the city to the next is 1. possible and 2. fun, interesting and beautiful.

The opposite of this to me was Shanghai. I loved the High Tech city and sure, you could walk very well through downtown and specific areas, where the main attractions were located, but just randomly going from one place to another was tedious and mostly just not.... fun or interesting. The streets were not nice to explore, you either walk next to big ass roads, or through very run down and just not pretty areas and most of the time, there's people on their mopeds almost running you over.

An example of what I would be looking for would be the Chinese equivalent of Tokyo: Walking through the different parts of the city was actual fun, even though it is also really big. Even walking through residential areas, there was always something to explore, hidden and nice coffee spots to find, random lively markets everywhere etc. 
In Shanghai, I always felt like the different areas had ""invisible borders"", in which the fun and pretty stuff was contained. If you walked too far in one direction, you would walk out of the pretty and lively zones and end up in the rundown areas with basically nothing to see.

So I really enjoy the urban life, I love going to restaurants and cafes etc. I'm not someone who enjoys nature and monuments thaaaat much. I enjoy it more, if the overall city is nice to look at in comparison to specific touristic areas being well maintained.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a *thrilling* November 6 clash between Real Betis and Lyon in Seville, where the stakes are high, the odds are lower for Lyon, and the humor is dialed to 11. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Swiss watch and the wit of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite, and Why?

The bookmakers have Real Betis as the clear favorite, with odds hovering around **1.6 to 1.69** (implying a **60-62% implied probability** of victory). Lyon, meanwhile, is a longshot at **4.9 to 5.0** (**\~20% chance**), while the draw sits at **\~25-26%**. On paper, Betis should romp. But let’s not forget: odds are written by humans, and humans once thought a hamster could’t balance a globe on its nose… until science.

Key stats:

* **Betis** has just one Europa League win (vs. Ludogorets) and two goalless draws, including a 0-0 with Genk. Their attack? A slow toaster in a bakery—present but unlikely to make anything *golden*.
* **Lyon** is undefeated in the group stage (3-0-0), with a defense so solid they’ve shipped just 0.67 goals per game. They’ve also won five of six Ligue 1 matches this season, despite financial woes and a coaching drama that makes *Succession* look tame.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Ambitions, and Circuses

Let’s start with Lyon’s **Malick Fofana**, their injured midfielder. The Frenchman went down “heavily” against Strasbourg, which is football speak for “he tripped over his own ambition and face-planted into a medical tent.” Without him, Lyon’s midfield loses a metronome—think of it as swapping a symphony conductor for a drunken tambourine player.

On the flip side, Real Betis has **Antony**, their Brazilian winger who’s been scorching recently (two goals vs. Mallorca). But can he carry a team that’s won just once in three Europa League matc
