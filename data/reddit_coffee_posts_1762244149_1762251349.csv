1oo3or7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheUpcomingTech/comments/1oo3or7/skills_required_for_career_growth/,Skills required for career growth,"Technology moves fast, faster than coffee cools on your desk sometimes. What is hot today might feel outdated just a year later. But if you know where to look, you can spot which skills are set to skyrocket in 2025 and 2026. And honestly, it is quite exciting to think about where all this digital madness is heading.

We live in a time when your ability to code, analyze data, or even have a sharp sense of digital ethics can define how far your career goes. I have seen people pivot from basic IT support to automation architects and pull six figure salaries within two years. The world is no longer run by companies alone, it's powered by people who know how to bend code, optimize AI, or design systems that think faster than humans ever could. So here’s the list: 10 tech skills everyone going to want, need, and probably race to learn before someone else beats them to it.

Some will sound familiar, others might surprise you.

Let’s dive into the top 10 tech skills most in demand in 2025 and 2026.



1. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

AI is not just the future anymore, it is right here, shaping everything from chatbots to medical diagnosis tools. Think of how ridiculously accurate recommendation systems on Netflix or Spotify have become, that’s machine learning in action. Companies are hungry for professionals who can train, tune, and explain these models.

One of my friends in Bengaluru started as a backend developer but jumped into AI three years back. Now he is working with a major healthtech startup, using neural networks to detect cardiac issues from wearable device data. To me, that is nothing short of amazing. AI roles, from prompt engineers to model governance analysts, are exploding globally. If you can craft intelligent algorithms or fine tune large language models, you’re already ahead of the game.


2. Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking

Picture this: banks, hospitals, and even social media platforms fighting daily to block thousands of cyberattacks. It is kind of terrifying when you think about it. Every digital transaction, every email, it's all vulnerable.

That’s why cybersecurity experts are more valuable than ever. Ethical hackers are one step ahead of the bad guys, constantly testing defenses. Companies like Google and Microsoft are throwing big money at people who can safeguard their infrastructure. I once met a cybersecurity consultant in Pune who joked that his job was basically to legally break things. And truthfully, there’s a thrill in knowing you protect millions just by spotting one small vulnerability.


3. Cloud Computing and DevOps

Remember when software had to be installed from a CD? Those days are gone. Everything runs on the cloud now, servers, databases, computation power, you name it. From AWS to Azure to Google Cloud, businesses are going all in on cloud based systems.

Developers who also understand CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes have unmatched leverage. I kind of love how DevOps sounds like technical poetry, its efficiency meeting agility, wrapped in automation. Whether in fintech or gaming, cloud engineers are building the backbone of how the world runs online.

1oo3oay,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hennasupplier/comments/1oo3oay/which_henna_powder_is_chemicalfree/,Which Henna Powder Is Chemical-Free?,"Finding chemical-free henna powder can be challenging in a market full of synthetic blends. Many products labelled “natural” still contain PPD, ammonia, or peroxide—chemicals that can harm both scalp and hair. Understanding what defines a truly pure product is essential, especially for brands seeking trustworthy hair colour manufacturers or hair colour suppliers for private label or bulk sourcing.





# What Makes Henna Truly Chemical-Free?

Pure henna is derived from *Lawsonia inermis* leaves, dried and finely powdered without any artificial additives. The best henna for hair should be:

* 100% plant-based  
* Free from PPD (paraphenylenediamine)  
* Free from ammonia and peroxide  
* Sourced from organically cultivated henna plants  
* Processed without synthetic dyes or preservatives  

A certified [**hair colour manufacturer**](https://kirpalexport.com/herbal-hair-colors-chemical-free/) ensures these standards through laboratory testing and clean production methods. For example, large exporters in India, such as Kirpal Export Overseas, specialise in herbal hair colours that maintain the purity and consistency required for professional and retail use.





# Why Choosing a Certified Hair Color Manufacturer Matters

When you source from a reputable hair colour manufacturer, you benefit from:

||
||
|**Quality Aspect**|**Why It Matters**|
|Ingredient Purity|Ensures 100% natural composition|
|Lab Certification|Confirms product safety and compliance|
|Consistent Shade Results|Guarantees reliability for private labels|
|OEM & Private Label Options|Enables brands to customize packaging and branding|
|Scalp Safety|Minimizes allergic reactions and irritation|

These manufacturers often offer extensive shade ranges—such as Wine Red, Amber, Blonde, and Deep Brown—made entirely from herbs like indigo, amla, and cassia.





# Understanding Chemical-Free Hair Color: How It Works

Unlike synthetic hair dyes that penetrate the hair shaft using ammonia and peroxide, herbal hair colour coats the outer layer of the hair. The natural dye molecule in henna—*lawsone*—binds with keratin, giving hair a vibrant tone and natural shine.

This plant-based process not only colours hair but also strengthens strands, making it ideal for clients with sensitive scalps or those avoiding chemical exposure.

Professional hair colour suppliers recommend this approach for brands targeting the growing “clean beauty” segment, which prioritises safety and sustainability.





# Real-World Case Example

A natural beauty brand from Australia wanted to replace its synthetic hair dye range with an herbal option. After partnering with an Indian hair colour manufacturer, the company introduced a 100% PPD-free, ammonia-free line. Within six months, customer feedback showed:

* 72% improvement in scalp comfort  
* 60% increase in repeat buyers  
* Noticeable enhancement in hair texture and shine  

This success underlines how partnering with experienced hair colour suppliers offering certified herbal formulations can elevate brand reputation and customer trust.





# Expert Insight

According to herbal cosmetic formulators, using a mix of henna, indigo, and hibiscus powder can create different natural shades without chemicals. Maintaining proper leaf drying temperature (below 50°C) preserves dye content, ensuring strong colour release.

Such production precision is often achieved only by large-scale hair colour manufacturers who use advanced milling and sterilisation systems while maintaining eco-friendly standards.





# Choosing the Best Henna for Hair: A Checklist

When selecting the best henna for hair, check the following:

1. **Ingredients list:** It should mention only natural herbs.  
2. **Smell:** Pure henna has an earthy aroma, not a chemical scent.  
3. **Texture:** Fine, smooth powder ensures even application.  
4. **Color release:** High dye content indicates freshness.  
5. **Certifications:** Look for ISO, GMP, or USDA Organic standards.  

A reliable hair colour supplier will always provide lab reports or COAs (Certificates of Analysis) proving product purity and safety.





# Why Private Label Brands Prefer Herbal Hair Colors

Private label and OEM brands seek consistent quality and bulk capability. A trusted hair colour manufacturer like those in India offers:

* Custom shade creation using natural ingredients  
* Eco-friendly packaging options  
* Scalable production for global markets  
* Support with labeling and export documentation  

These advantages make herbal hair color a smart addition for brands promoting the [**best hair color** ](https://kirpalexport.com/henna-based-hair-colors/)alternatives that are safe and effective.





# Are All “Natural” Hennas Safe?

Not always. Some products marketed as “herbal” mix small amounts of henna with chemical dyes for faster results. These can trigger allergic reactions or cause dryness. Always verify if the product is chemical-free and made by a certified hair colour manufacturer who provides transparent ingredient data.





# FAQs

# 1. How do I know if my henna is natural?

Check the label for ingredients—pure henna should list only *Lawsonia inermis*. Avoid any mention of PPD, metallic salts, or synthetic dyes. Natural henna has an earthy smell and produces an orange-brown stain on the skin when mixed with water.





# 2. How do I make homemade henna?

You can make your own natural paste by mixing 100 g of pure henna powder with ¼ cup of lemon juice or warm water. Let it rest for 6–8 hours for dye release. Apply it to clean hair, cover it, and leave it for 2–3 hours before rinsing.





# 3. How to cover grey hair naturally without henna?

You can use herbal alternatives like indigo powder, amla, coffee, or black tea for mild tinting. For a darker and longer-lasting result, combine indigo and henna in specific ratios, which many hair colour manufacturers formulate for natural grey coverage.





# Final Thought

In today’s conscious beauty market, chemical-free henna stands as a safe, authentic, and eco-friendly alternative to synthetic dyes. Brands and distributors working with experienced hair colour manufacturers gain access to certified, customisable formulations trusted by professionals worldwide.

Choosing the best henna for hair isn’t just about colour—it’s about health, sustainability, and long-term quality.

So this isn't actually about me but about my wife and she is looking for advice about the situation and how to handle it.

This has been going on for well over a year but seems to be getting worse.

My wife has a friend of many years (from school days) however a few years ago my wife came across a Twitter profile that has the exact same photos as her social media profiles for example everytime we go on holiday, any holiday pictures that are uploaded by my wife or her family are later (sometimes a week and sometimes a month or two) uploaded to this Twitter profile with the person pretending they have been travelling to these countries and doing these activities.

From doing some digging, research and speaking to other friends we found out this is the secret profile of another friend. The constant stealing of photos and pretending it is her traveling and her life is weird but didn't seem dangerous and the photos didn't contain my wife's face but recently my wife's friend took this to another level.

As my wife's friend started to gain popularity with these photos and stories of her travels which are all ours she has dived deeper into these lies and started to pretend that she went to the same universities abroad as my wife, studied the same courses, speaks the same multiple languages and even does the same jobs, runs her own family business in the same industry and does the same projects.

My wife is quite a private person so her social media is completely locked down to everyone except friends and even then she doesn't really post a lot but now she feels like she has to worry about things other people may post and upload or things she uploads as even going to a concert, restaurant, grabbing a coffee or having a day out is copied by this friend. She is also worried this will become dangerous for her family and friends.

This has changed from being weird to stalkerish to psycho tendencies.

Has anyone else been in this situation and what would you do? Her friend doesn't know that we know about the secret profile. Would you approach and confront this friend and How would you approach this subject? We are also worried about this person using my wife's face to pretend to be her although we haven't seen her do this  as yet on the profiles we know about but if she has done all this it makes us wonder if she might try to catfish people. Are we overexagerating this situation or are we right to think this is too much and dangerous now?",1,1762251073.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Same season, completely different vibes.  
  
This Halloween, the coffee chains didn’t just sell drinks.  
They sold moods, habits, and micro-experiences.  
Each brand was running a different strategy, aimed at a different kind of customer.  
  
Krispy Kreme: The Sweet Drop

Krispy Kreme went real-world. Limited flavors, limited time, and high-saturation visuals that practically screamed “Now Open!”  
Boxes stacked, glaze shining, local store addresses in bold red. It’s less brand storytelling, more “you need this today.”

Why it worked: They sold urgency. While others aimed for feelings, Krispy Kreme aimed for FOMO. The drop itself was the marketing. You didn’t just see it—you felt you might miss it.

Dunkin — The Pop Escape

Dunkin went full color-pop. Think pastel clouds, floating drinks, and dreamy filters that feel straight off TikTok.  
Their “Daydream Refreshers” campaign made iced drinks look like fantasy objects. The offer was simple: “$3 after 1pm.”  
Quick hit. Big color. Easy scroll-stopper.

Why it worked: Dunkin sold fun. They turned Halloween from spooky to playful. The tone said “treat yourself” without the calories of self-serious branding. Every ad felt like dopamine: bright, fast, and repeatable. r

Halloween used to be about costumes and fear. Now it’s about identity and indulgence.  
Krispy Kreme made it urgent while Dunkin made it fun. 

So here’s my question for the room:  
If you were running a brand next October, which “Halloween mindset” would you go for?  
And which coffee brand do you think actually won this year?",1,1762251037.0,DigitalMarketing,2,1.0,False

We started as co-workers, became friends, and somewhere along the line it turned into something deeper — not a defined relationship, but there was definitely an unspoken attachment between us.

A few days ago, during our weekly team meeting, I found out from our coordinator that she’s being relocated — and she’s leaving in just a few days. She never told me herself. I had to find out like everyone else.

That honestly stung. It’s not that she’s moving; it’s that she kept it from me. It made me realize that maybe what I thought we had wasn’t as meaningful to her as it was to me. That gap between perception and reality hurts more than the move itself.

I told her straight up that I was angry and disappointed. She apologized and even suggested we have coffee before she leaves, but I said no. What confuses me is that now she’s acting like she still cares — checking in, trying to act normal, even being extra nice — as if that somehow undoes the fact that she didn’t think I deserved honesty in the first place.

I don’t get it. If you cared, why hide something that big? And if you didn’t care, why act like you do now?

I’m thinking of telling her I wish her the best, but I’m stepping back completely. No lingering chats, no drawn-out goodbyes. Just peace and distance.

Still, I can’t lie — it’s been keeping me up at night. It’s hard to accept that maybe I built a story in my head that she was never really part of. But I’m trying to take it as a lesson: when someone shows inconsistency, believe it early.

Silence might be the only closure I get — and maybe that’s okay.

Elias felt the hum rise through the floor, a vibration small enough to doubt yet steady enough to make his teeth ache. He looked at the lobby doors. Beyond the glass, the city was a motionless photograph. Cars frozen mid-turn, steam halted above manholes. He blinked; the scene resumed.

He wrote a note in the logbook—hand shaky.

>

He pushed the pen aside. The polished marble under the desk still carried the faint outline of his reflection. It seemed slower tonight, a fraction behind when he moved his hand.

Third-person: Surveillance footage from the same moment would later show the lobby perfectly still. Elias’s hand never moved.

Back in first: he leaned back, trying to shake the exhaustion crawling behind his eyes. His phone showed no signal. The building’s Wi-Fi—“AURELIAN-STAFF”—required a password the folder hadn’t included.

He listened. No pipes, no footsteps, only the clock and the hum.

At 12:17 a.m., the elevator bell chimed once. He froze. The display above the doors remained dark. No floor indicator, no motion. The sound came again—*ding*—thin, metallic, distant, like it traveled through miles of tunnel.

He stared at the closed doors, remembering Rule 2.  
*If the elevator opens by itself, do not look inside.*

It hadn’t opened, he told himself. Just the bell. Still allowed.

He stood, walked halfway across the lobby, then stopped. The light on the ceiling wavered, almost imperceptibly. He held still.

Seconds stretched. The golden glow pulsed, breathing, dim-bright-dim. The air shifted temperature—cold across the back of his neck, heat pressing at his face. Then normal again.

He swallowed. His throat clicked in the silence.

Another note in the logbook:

>

He underlined *fine* twice, a habit from years of foreman reports.

Third-person lens: Camera feed flickers. Frame 227 shows Elias mid-stride toward the elevator; frame 228, he’s back behind the desk. Intermediate footage missing.

The minutes bled. He checked his watch—1:07 a.m. Outside, fog now pressed against the glass, turning the city to pale shapes.

He tried the coffee machine behind the desk. Cold. When he hit the power switch, the lobby lights dimmed in sympathy. He switched it off immediately. The light stabilized, but the hum deepened, lower than before.

He muttered, “Okay, you win.”

Paper rustled. Not from him. The folder on the counter opened itself slightly, just enough for air to slip through. Inside, the envelope marked *PAYMENT – NIGHT ONE* had changed shape; something now outlined against the paper—a coin or ring pressing from within.

He didn’t touch it.

At 1:46 a.m., faint footsteps crossed the marble behind him. Deliberate, unhurried, barefoot. He turned. Empty lobby. Reflection in the mirror still faced the desk, not him.

He stared at it until the next tick of the clock, then forced himself to sit again. His reflection didn’t follow right away.

He wrote nothing.

Third-person observation: frame timestamp 1:47:08 – a second figure appears behind the desk, translucent gold at the edges, same posture, same face. Frame 1:47:09 – figure gone.

First-person again: Elias fought sleep, blinking through the slow minutes. The golden light kept deepening, richer, almost liquid. He imagined he could taste it—metallic sweetness, faint like copper on a bitten tongue.

At 2:31 a.m., the hum stopped. Not faded—stopped.

He stood before realizing he’d moved. The silence pressed harder than the sound ever had. He turned in a slow circle. The air wavered, distortions forming where heat should be. The mirror rippled once, surface soft as water, then solidified.

He whispered Halden’s line out loud: “Don’t call me unless the clock stops ticking.”

The clock ticked. Relief hit him hard enough to shake a laugh out of his throat. The echo of that laugh returned a second later—lower, slower, like a reply through thick glass.

He sat back down, jaw locked. No more noise until dawn, he told himself.

At 3:12 a.m., the phone rang.

One soft tone. Not loud—felt instead of heard, vibration through the desk.

He stared at it until 3:18 a.m. The sound never repeated. Rule 5 held. He didn’t answer.

After that, fatigue swallowed perception. Time folded.

Third-person: Security camera shows Elias sitting motionless, eyes open, breathing steady, for forty-three minutes straight. No blink recorded.

At 4:02 a.m., lights dimmed once more. Reflection matched perfectly again, timing restored.

Elias rubbed his face, convinced dawn couldn’t be far. He wrote his final note of the shift:

He closed the logbook. Behind him, the clock ticked on rhythm.

### Training
I booked this race as soon as I got the opportunity, which was in January via Abbott's Age Group World Champions (AGWC) scheme, in the age category 65-69. There was extra cost, but also a few perks like a Wave 1 start and a dedicated tent in the start village, plus it sounds grand! I booked the flights and hotel; then in April ran Manchester marathon and qualified (just!) to run as an England Masters Representative in the Abingdon Marathon. That also seemed like a great opportunity, though it was just two weeks before New York. I figured I would run Abingdon in the best time I could manage, and then run New York without worrying much about the pace.

I trained therefore for Abingdon, using the Pfitzinger and Douglas 18/55 schedule from their book Advanced Marathoning. I added some extra miles where possible, on the basis that high mileage would help me with the intensive fortnight to come. Peak week over the training period was 71.5 miles. Three week taper for Abingdon in the normal way, that race went well and I got a PB of 3:25:33.

I was then into two weeks of recovery/taper for New York, punctuated by a 10 mile race in the middle weekend. Ran that with a 10 mile PB, then on the Thursday headed from the UK to New York.

On Saturday I ran the Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K with my wife, intending to run it as a shake-out at around 8:00/mile. This is a delightful race with around 10,000 runners, from the United Nations building through the streets of Manhatten and into Central Park, with the finish being the same as for the marathon the following day. I ran a little faster than planned and was surprised to find myself 3rd in age category, perhaps because most marathon runners in the race were more sensible and saved their legs.

Saturday afternoon though things began to fall apart. We had been in all sorts of crowds and queues, at the airport and on trains and planes, at the expo, near the Village Parade (Halloween celebration) on Friday evening, and more. I picked up some kind of mild bug; I didn't feel right, my nose was blocked and my throat was sore. With these things, you never know if it is the beginning of something worse, or something that will soon clear up. I did the best thing I could think of, which was to sleep as much as possible. So at 20:00 I was in bed with the alarm set for 4:00am. It was not an easy night as fretted about how I felt, and whether I should even run at all. Missing the race would be wretched after so much preparation and getting to New Yori; on the other hand, running while sick could make a mild illness much worse.

Luckily I made a good recovery overnight; and who knows, maybe there was a touch of maranoia in there too. My nose was clear, my stomach was fine, and the sore throat nearly gone. Got up, grabbed my start bag, and headed for the subway to the New York Public Library and the 5:00am bus to the start.

### Pre-race
Arriving at the library at 4:45am was confusing at first. There were buses in front of the library but no queues and it took me a while to figure out that the you had to wait at the back of the library, where I joined hundreds of other runners and began to feel a bit of race excitement. The bus, we were warned, could take up to 90 minutes. In practice though it took less than half that time, presumably because of the early hour, and we were unloaded into a cold, pitch-dark start area at at about 5:40am, three and half hours before the race started.

I had been told that the start village is not a great experience and so it proved. The first challenge was to find the AGWC tent; the signage was not brilliant but after wandering around for a bit I figured out that there are several different colour villages, and that my village was orange. A volunteer pointed me in the right direction and I found the AGWC area which actually had two tents with plastic seats, the same bagels and coffee that were on offer everywhere, and some dedicated portaloos. There were nowhere near enough seats for everyone so I sat on the grass in one of the tents, grateful that it was a bit warmer than outside, and chatted to some other runners. One told me that she had done a 100 mile race two weeks ago, and the Marine Corps Marathon (MCM) a week ago, which made my own schedule look easy. Tapering is overdone, she said, adding that she ran for the experience not the performance.

At around 8:10am we were led round to the start corral, went in an milled around for a bit, then decided I should do a bit of warming up, exited the corral and ran round in circles with some others, doing perhaps half a mile at easy pace. Then back into the corral before it closed at 8:45. I felt OK and ready to start.

As we got near to the start time of 9:10am the ribbons dividing Orange A B and C were removed and we moved up to the bridge and the start line. I consumed my first gel. Frank Sinatra sang New York New York. At last, after the most complicated race logistics I have encountered, we were running.

### Race
The marathon begins with a slow gentle climb up the bridge and everything was fine. I tried to hold about an 8:00/mile pace which would get me a 3:30. The weather was perfect and the crowd support started as soon as we arrived into Brooklyn; it was amazing. 

All went well until about half way; pace slipped a bit in miles 11 and 12 but not badly. After mile 13 though I began to slow down. It was not hitting the wall; it was just fatigue, combined with three other factors:

- I was not at my best after feeling unwell the day before
- I had run intensively over the previous two weeks including a marathon, a 10 mile race and then the Dash to the Finish Line 5K
- The time did not matter that much to me. I had planned for this to be an easier race having gone all-out at Abingdon

I do not know which of these factors was the most important. Running a race though is a mental as well as a physical effort, and whereas in my previous marathons I was highly motivated to get a target time, for this one all I wanted was something respectable, and when I found it hard to keep the pace I just let it slip.

I had some other issues. One was that the Garmin got further and further ahead of the mile markers. This is inevitable as one does not take the shortest path; but seemed worse than usual; my final Garmin distance was 26.57 miles. I looked at the Garmin less than usual, for this reason and also because I knew I would not like the pace it showed.

Another was nausea. I took a gel at the start and again at 5 miles, 10 miles and 15 miles. I stopped at the water stations when thirsty which was about 1 in 3 of them. I would normally take another at 20 miles but my body was telling me that if I did, I might vomit. Better, I thought, to keep my stomach settled rather than throw up.

Despite all the above, I loved the race. It was as if I had compartmentalised my brain; one part was thinking about race strategy, while another was just enjoying the experience of running over bridges with jaw-dropping views and through the boroughs of New York City each with their own character, while being cheered constantly by a crowd of New Yorkers.

 I had paid a ridiculous $10.00 to have my name on the bib; it was a waste of money because printed so small. However I was wearing my club vest which said ""Winchester Running Club"", and heard constant shouts of encouragement for ""Winchester!"" and also had a few chats with other runners who knew the city or were curious which Winchester it was. One said, ""are you red or blue?"" I was puzzled but then realised he had read the name as ""Manchester"" and was referencing two famous football teams! So I explained.

 At around mile 21 I attempted to do some sums to work out what sort of time I could manage. I knew 3:30 was well out of reach but sub-3:45 still seemed possible and I wanted to achieve that. So I put in some effort to keep my pace; most of the variation in those last miles is because of climbs or descents. Going into Central Park was a big boost and I loved the experience of running there. Then you go out onto the street briefly, then back into Central Park for the finish. Waved at my wife who had somehow bagged a great spectator position around 200m from the finish, crossed the line in 3:37:39 which was only a few seconds worse than my time at Abingdon Marathon 2024. If I am reading correctly, it is a good enough time to get me into the NYC marathon next year, should I wish to repeat the experience.

### Post-race
The finish experience was not that great, too much walking and waiting before I was done. You are moved on quickly for obvious reasons; with nearly 60,000 runners it could easily clog up. I picked up a goody bag, the lovely medal, a second finisher medal for AGWC, and a bright orange poncho. Then I was in another line for an AGWC photo, then picked up my dropped bag (very quick), found my wife and headed back to the hotel. 
 
The subway journey though was amazing, so many people sayng ""congratulations"" when they saw the poncho and medal.

The following day we headed out early; the finish area was being dismantled but there was a photo spot for showing off your medal and getting your picture taken (on your own mobile phone) by a volunteer. There was also the marathon pavilion with copies of the New York Times showing all the sub-4 hour finishers plus a few more, medal engraving, and some official finisher shirts and tops. After that we squeezed in a free trip (for medal holders) to the spectacular Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center before we had to go to the airport for the flight home.

### Tips and learnings
- Doing two marathons in two weeks is not for everyone. A carefully managed taper followed by the race and then a recovery plan is the right approach if you want the best time and lower injury risk. But if you find, as I do, that you recover quite quickly, then it can be done without disaster.

- The travel and stress of getting to the start line for a major marathon thousands of miles from home is substantial and does not help your health or your pace.

- Regarding the NYC marathon, for those staying in Manhattan the main options for travel to the start are the bus or the ferry. I chose the bus because it goes direct to the start, whereas with the ferry you still need a bus from the ferry terminal to the start. The snag with the bus though is that you have leave really early, before the roads close. With hindsight I wish I had taken the ferry, which would have given me a bit more time in bed and got me to the start later.

- The AGWC is extra cost but has some nice extras; having the tents at the start village was a big bonus despite the overcrowding. I do have reservations though about starting in wave 1. The problem was that many of us would normally be in a later wave, so we were overtaken by faster runners and the pace team was no use. On the plus side, earlier start means earlier finish. The water stations were plentiful but lack of trash bins meant most cups were simply dropped on the ground and became a slip hazard; I am guessing that this gets worse for later waves since the volunteers cannot easily sweep them away.

- The energy and excitement of the NYC marathon is like nothing I have experienced before; it is a great run and worth striving for.

1oo3k93,https://i.redd.it/3r88hi9dr7zf1.jpeg,Made a free expense tracker because I was tired of apps that either cost money or wanted my bank login,"I've been broke enough times to know that $20 here and $30 there adds up fast, but I could never stick with budgeting apps. Some wanted $5-15/month (ironic for a budgeting app), others needed my bank login which sketched me out, and most were just confusing as hell.

Got frustrated enough that I built my own. It's called ExpenseWise Manager & Budgets and it's completely free on the Play Store.

**Why I made it different:**

**No bank linking required** \- Just manually add your expenses. Takes 10 seconds. I actually prefer this because it makes you think about each purchase.

**Actually free** \- No ""free trial then $9.99/month"" BS. No ads either. Just free.

**Set budgets that make sense** \- Like ""$150 for groceries this month"" not some complicated percentage system. Get alerts before you go over, not after.

**How it's helped me:**

* Realized I was spending $80/month on energy drinks from the gas station. Switched to making coffee at home, saved $60/month.
* Set up bill reminders so I don't get hit with late fees (those $35 fees kill you when you're already tight)
* Can see exactly how much money I have left after bills before next payday
* Track multiple goals at once - emergency fund, car repair fund, etc.

**Features that actually matter :**

* Multiple account tracking (checking, that savings account with $50, prepaid card)
* Calendar view so you can see what you spent each day
* Export your data anytime (good for taxes or if you need records for assistance programs)

The Charlotte FC vs. New York City FC MLS playoff series has all the ingredients of a soap opera: a tied 1-1 series, a best-of-three decider, and odds so tight you’d think the bookmakers used a sewing needle. Let’s dissect this clash with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tug-of-War

The betting lines tell a story of two evenly matched rivals. Charlotte FC is the slight favorite at decimal odds of **2.4** (implied probability: \~41.7%), while NYCFC checks in at **2.7** (\~37.0%). The draw? A tidy **3.4** (\~29.4%), because nothing says “thrilling finale” like a potential tie that forces fans to invent new ways to scream.

These numbers scream parity. It’s the soccer equivalent of flipping a coin—except this coin has three sides: *Charlotte*, *NYCFC*, and *“Why is the grass on fire?”* The spread lines (even money on both teams) and totals (2.5 goals) reinforce this: expect a nail-biter where both teams could punch each other’s lights out or kick the ball into the stands out of frustration.

### Digesting the News: A Tale of Two Cities (and Penalties)

Charlotte and NYCFC’s series has been a rollercoaster. They opened with a 1-1 draw on October 28, a game so uneventful it made a toddler’s nap look action-packed. Then came the November 1 penalty shootout—a *7-6* thriller that would’ve made even the most jaded sports fan reach for their heart medication. Charlotte survived, but not without drama: NYCFC’s star striker missed a penalty so wide, a squirrel could’ve used it as a snack trail.

Charlotte’s secret weapon? A penalty-kick prowess that’d make a bank robber blush. Their 7-6 shootout win wasn’t jus

so hear me out. I have read quite a few Romantasy books in the last months and there are some overused and stylized things I cannot stand anymore, either because I find it cringy or it is used too much in these kinds of books.

I am NOT speaking about preferences regardings labels like reverse harem, cheating, why chose etc

I will start, three things I cannot stand anymore include:

1. Nicknames consisting of the word 'little' + an animal name. Ive read a book where the MMC calls her little butterfly for example and I found it unbearably cringy. Other examples include: little raven, little dove, little snake abd many more XD

2. All those body odeurs which don't have a logical explanation. Its fine if the author describes real smells (like the leather the character is wearing, a cologne or a shower gel), but when the MMCs just naturally smell like coffee, sandlewood, vanilla or the rain, is just awkward and its heavily overused in my opinion

3. I hate it when the MMC tells the FMC when she is allowed to have an orgasm. I dont find it sexy, maybe because it doesnt work for me irl. What is fine though, is when the MMC tells the FMC when NOT to come, for some reason.

Now its your turn! Tell me ehat annoys you and what you find too repepetive/overused.

Jumped straight into coding without talking to users first (big mistake).

- Live updates  
- Doctor schedule

1oo3di1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1oo3di1/vent_my_dad_is_socially_behaving_like_a_little/,[Vent] My dad is socially behaving like a little child and I'm at my limit,"I just need a safe space for a moment to collect myself, hope you can indulge me.

This is my situation: I (33) moved in with my dad (66) roughly a year ago after experiencing the lowest point in my life thus far. I had just started college yet again and it was all too much. I wouldn't say I was close to ending my life, because I'm way too scared of that and even in the darkest moment, I still knew there are things out there worth living for. But I was extremely desperate and distressed with the way my life has been going these last 10 years.

Okay, so now I'm living my childhood home again and to be honest, it's not a bad living situation overall if it weren't for the ever returning conflicts with my dad.  
He is not a well reflected man. Stubborn in all the wrong places, a control hog and very likely with undiagnosed ADHD (I don't fault him for that).  
Before I moved in, he was all alone in this big house. My mom passed 5 years ago after 10 years of up and down with cancer. It wrecked me. We were very close and very similar.  
My brothers are living in other cities and rarely visit, because my dad is best enjoyed in very small doses, they can't bare being around him that long. And I totally get that, he is nearly impossible to get along with in way that doesn't diminish oneself.

I'm super conflict averse (many of you will understand, I feel) and I'm letting a lot of his stupid, thoughtless remarks slide, because I'm well aware that arguing with him about it is a pointless endeavor. Since I have moved in here, there have been three incidents in which I couldn't contain myself any longer and had loud outbursts.  
You gotta know, I'm a quiet, compassionate and gentle soul. The people in my life (sans my dad) are reflecting me this again and again. And I know it to be true as well.  
So when I'm pushed to yell at someone, any person that truly knows me will understand, that the circumstances must be pretty severe to have gotten to that point.

That is to make clear, my dad doesn't know me and has never taken the time or interest to get to know me in a meaningful way.

Anyways, since he retired he has been in steep decline. Mentally and physically. He is alcoholic, never drinks a drop of water (lots of coffee and grape juice though), doesn't exercise, doesn't eat well if I don't cook something healthy for us, lies on the couch all day and watches reality shows devoid of any intellectual stimulation, never cleans his little dark corner of the house (I did a few weeks ago when he was away for the weekend, there was literally a 5mm layer of dust on the windowsil). To summarize, he is not taking care of himself at all, refuses to get himself checked out by a doc and declined every opportunity for change that I (or life) presented to him.  
Beginning of the year, I had to drive him to the hospital for a yet undefined condition (stroke like though) and that should have been a wake up call for him. But as soon as he recovered a bit, he returned to his old ways. Since then he has his bouts of feeling weak and being incapacitated. That's when I pick up the slack, do everything around the house (taking care of the dog, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, making sure he is still breathing, etc).  
He is coughing constantly in a really nasty way and tells himself (and believes) lies about his health, completely blocking out reality and the severity of the situation.

The last few days he was in one of those phases again. He didn't really leave the bed for 3 days. I had just returned from a week long getaway of sorts (I was catsitting for a friend who was on vacation) so I returned in a bit of a weakened state myself. Taking care of everything so soon after having proper time to reaccustom myself had me drained.  
Yesterday was especially exhausting, since my day started with a 2 hour call with a childhood friend who has a serious drug problem and I was trying to tell him helpful things. I had other things to do as well and in the evening I spent 1,5 hours in the kitchen preparing a soup (with cooking out chicken legs, which I despised but did anyway to do my dad a solid) at the request of my dad.  
While I was nearing the end of the cooking process, he came down the stairs and I noticed instantly that he was feeling better. He started hovering around me, touching everything, stirring the pot unprompted, etc. Very annoying to me, but I didn't say anything.  
I served the soup, we were eating, he was telling me extremely uninteresting things he saw on the tv, I ignored it because I just didn't have the mental capacity anymore to engage in that and just wanted dinner to be over so I could to my room and finally relax.  
But then it had to escalate again. He was poking around his food and picked up some chicken on his spoon and started saying something about bird flu and contamination (his deranged version of humor) and I reached my personal limit (though at that point, still calm and collected). So I said to him: ""Would you stop that please"" and he replied with a devious ""No"". I looked at him in disbelief and said to him: ""Why can't you just respect my wishes? I told you in a respectful manner to please stop and you just say 'No'? Are you serious?""  
He then declared that he didn't say 'No', that he in fact said 'Yes' and smiled at me.

Well, I got very angry at that point and started getting loud.  
He has zero self awareness, which he displays in a variety of daily situations big and small, he is getting forgetful, mixes up things all the time and just is not an attentive person. He has spent the three days prior in a sort of vegetative state and isn't even considering for a fraction of second to have said that? Jesus Christ, it is so hopeless with this guy.  
I also pointed out how it made absolutely no sense at all, that I would react with my reply of him not respecting my wishes if he had said 'Yes'. His reply to that was that it in fact made no sense, but that I just misheard him and that I'm always so sensitive anyways.  
There is no getting through to him. He is so sure of himself, despite not having any reason to. He will never admit a fault, he will never change his stance on something. Once he was declared something to be 'the truth' he never can budge.  
The aforementioned big outbursts of mine have come to be in a very similar manner. Him denying to have said something that he clearly said just minutes past.  
It will happen again in the future if I continue living here. But getting out at this point is not going to be easy at all. I'm at a loss for what I'm going to do now.  
As of now I'm financially dependent on him (the only thing he could ever do was provide on a material level, he was a poor excuse of a father figure elsewhere) but I have made concrete plans with a very good friend yesterday to help me into my country's basic income program.

It just saddens me, that he is behaving this way. I'm the only person in his life right now, that tolerates to hear him talk about the most mundane and uninteresting things, the only person that could take care of him in his times of need. Our family is completely shattered and dysfunctional and when I leave, he will have no one around and seeing how he chooses to live, I don't think he will have much time left. And with every altercation like the one I described, I care less and less what happens to him. And that is quite the achievement, because I really am a caring person at my core, who wants to enrich the world around me with kindness and patience.

I'm frustrated, I'm angry, I'm sad and I'm desperate too. All I wanted was to have a safe haven here, a starting ramp to get my life in order and plan my next steps. What I got was an impossible manchild and a load of work that shouldn't even be mine to begin with.

1oo3d9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1oo3d9k/my_gf_22f_lied_to_me_24m_about_her_body_count/,My gf (22F) lied to me (24M) about her body count.,"There is really no short way to explain this. I feel like the background of it needs to be explained in order to really understand the situation. Me and this girl are just exclusively talking. We aren’t boyfriend and girlfriend.  

Me and this girl have been seeing each other for a year and two months now. A few months into our relationship, we had had a conversation along the lines of body counts. I had said “ I would never take a girl seriously with the body count over 10 and I’d automatically think she was a slut or a whore” she told me her body count was 5. At first, I was a little bit skeptical a bit, but she was good at reassuring and letting me know that I was the only one. As time went on I started to be a little bit more skeptical. I found out that she had slept with a D1 basketball player. My initial assumption about girls that sleep with athletes get around when I asked her about this. She reassured me again that there has been no one else that she has left out. Shit was good again. A few months go by and I see on her phone that she is texting her coworker. Her messages with her coworker are completely platonic and she always mentions me and makes it clear that she is seeing someone even if the conversation didn’t lead to anything talking about that. As a man, I know the intentions of another man. I know that at the end of the day he doesn’t care that I exist and he would still try and pursue her, even if she gave no interest and knew that she had was seeing someone. 

I asked her to remove him and block him off of everything which she did. She then got fired from her job and texted him telling him that she got that she got fired after she texted him that she never had messaged him again and they never spoke or connected again. 

Things are going good again and summer starts to come to an end and she’s about to go back to college, which is an hour and a half away from me and also my former university. One of the first weekends that school started she drove up from school to visit me and we were having a wine night and I saw on her phone when she was opening it in front of me that there was this guy on her phone who she had known since high school. He kept constantly asking her to get lunch or coffee since he was in the area for a little bit and those conversation she mentions how she doesn’t want to meet up with him because it would be disrespectful to me. I still made her block him on and she did that without any hesitation. 

I start feeling more skeptical about her body count and I keep egging her on to tell me. About a month ago from present day we had a huge argument. She told me a different number of her body count. She said that it was eight. Then the next day she said it was 10 then 9. Finally, after getting everything out of her, she told me the truth. I feel deep down that she isn’t lying to me and that she is being honest with me. Ever since that day she has been over communicating with me, giving me every single detail of what she was doing, gave me her Instagram and Snapchat login, I had her find my location and Snapchat location. Like I mentioned how the wound is still fresh there is still times where I think about the situation and just need reassurance. That’s where I’d call her or text her and every time I call or text her she would respond to me almost immediately without any hesitation. I know that she’s really sorry for lying to me and she has taken accountability of it and has really tried to prove to me that she’s been loyal and faithful to me.

Then comes present day. The past week I have asked her to contact her old partners asking them when the last time they saw each other was all of them have said before the time that me and her slept together for the first time. I had also FaceTime her and asked her to keyword certain words on her laptop to go back to text messages from the time we first started seeing each other. There was one dude that kept asking to come over, but she kept dodging him and rejecting him. These messages happened right before we became exclusive. 

In the grand scheme of things, she has been a good girl to me. She has shown consistency ever since the day we started talking I went back through our chats and the way she would talk to me and tell me about her entire day in full detail, even when I didn’t really care about it at first she still did that and she still does that to this day. She would always ask me to FaceTime almost every single night. She has gone out of her way to learn basic about football in basketball because I’ve expressed my interest in those sports to her. She also has gotten us tickets to see an NFL game a few weeks ago. She has truly shown me nothing but love and care since the day we have started talking. I know that she loves me and I love her.

Took me some time to think this over. Sheridan’s script is flirting with the idea of

*‘poor Jamie, an eternal Dutton functionary, a tool for one’s purpose’*

and

*‘cold Christina, a product of D.C. upbringing, who carries a dozen hammers in her purse and sees every surface down here in Montana as nail’*

and

We’re not going in this direction now. Let’s save our pity for later and think instead about why no one really hears anyone in this scene. It feels like both Jamie and Christina are tuned to different frequencies, broadcasting in domestic tones that were never calibrated for intimacy. And yet they occupy the same room, saying the right things in the wrong register. Why do we believe Wes’s lingering uncertainty and Katherine’s sharp remarks and then everything falls apart just like it should? Let’s find out.

First, their worlds aren’t colliding. Not really. He’s a successful attorney, she’s a campaign manager who’s shaped narratives more than once. They share a language of power, a professional dialect of metrics, persuasion, optics, policy. They know the dance moves, how one should navigate around the room without rubbing too many shoulders or stomping on feet. They know how to rub against each other so it looks loving, gracious, not forced. And yet, when the curtain drops, when they are just Jamie and Christina, they fail to meet. Who are they in the world of Yellowstone when stripped of titles and roles?

Second, maybe Jamie didn’t want this coffee, after all, just the act of fetching it. And Christina wasn’t really forcing him to meet her parents and making it look like a family reunion engagement thing. They try to tread on each other’s ground, guessing that the floor is lava only to cry out when it’s scorching. The small gestures of warmth – the coffee, the glances – become both bridge and chasm.

And third – because there’s always a third – there was the spark we wanted to see, even if the characters might get burned. Which doesn’t appear.

*Maybe in another life.*

1oo3axo,https://www.reddit.com/r/flrdating/comments/1oo3axo/26_m4f_vancouver_i_want_to_explore_my_submissive/,"26 [M4F] #Vancouver I want to explore my submissive side more, looking for some gentle Domme connections! Preferably long-term/monogamous","Hi! I’m 5’4”, fit, with long curly hair and bangs. I’m a creative soul who thrives in nature. I love making art, climbing, thrifting, and exploring cozy cafés.

I’m a gentle, creative person who’s always been drawn to connection, care, and creativity. I trained as an artist for many years and have spent the last four working in animation, but lately I’ve been shifting gears toward something more compassion-focused—I’m exploring a career in healthcare. It feels like a natural step for me, since nurturing and supporting others has always been at the core of who I am.

I’m drawn to the energy of dominant–submissive dynamics, not purely in a sexual sense but in the feeling of trust, structure, and surrender. I find it exciting to give someone else a sense of control while feeling safe and cared for in return. I’ve always been fascinated by the balance of energy between people, especially within dominant–submissive dynamics. For me, it isn’t purely about sex—it’s about trust, structure, and emotional surrender. There’s something deeply calming and intimate about giving someone else a sense of control, about being guided with confidence and care. I’ve experienced both sides of that dynamic; I was in a long-term relationship where I was the dominant partner, and while it taught me a lot, I found it exhausting toward the end.

I want to explore being with someone who truly cares for me, where being with them makes me feel safe and cared for, no matter how stressful or scary life gets. I was in a long-term relationship previously where I put a lot of effort to care for someone who didn’t reciprocate the same energy. It was exhausting and it left me feeling like I wasn’t worthy of love.

I adore cats (I have two who rule my world), I got really lucky with them because they are the two cutest cats in the whole world. I could go on and on about them for days honestly.

I’m very nurturing, and I love caring for the people I’m close to. For the right Domme, I’d find joy in rituals of service—cooking a meal that suits your taste, writing or painting something inspired by you, listening and anticipating your needs before you even ask. It’s not about obligation—it’s about expression, about finding ways to honour and celebrate the person I’m with.

Outside of work, I teach drawing and am slowly building an art business of my own. I’m happiest when I’m learning, creating, or spending time with people who make me feel safe and inspired. I have a dream to make learning art much more accessible because I feel like so many people give up out of frustration and never get to experience the real thing.

Since childhood I never felt loved (it’s difficult to express that publicly like this.) It’s been a tough journey to heal from that and practice compassion in a way that could overcome that. That’s part of the reason why I sought out working in healthcare. I wish I could meet someone who can show me that feminine nurturing energy that I crave.

I’m looking for someone who’s grounded, confident, and kind—someone who enjoys leading with strength and gentleness, and who wants to build something meaningful and mutually empowering.

If that resonates with you, I’d love to chat and see where our energies align. I would love to get a coffee and talk or draw, or go for a walk by the water. 🖤",1,1762249672.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

1oo398b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1oo398b/after_dating_here_is_what_made_me_seek_girls/,After dating here is what made me seek girls abroad,"I have been in UAE for a year and was raised in two western countries. With the way I was treated, I had enough of dating girls here.

Overall my experience here was coming to realise girls here basically will run away after seeing one minor flaw or will run away if a small mistake was made that they didn't like to which their reaction was over the top. Guys are definitely not innocent considering how much cheating goes on over here while being married and having kids. Utterly disgusting. I don't understand why people here are treating others like garbage.

I decided to meet girls from other countries and it is so much better. Despite being long-distance (just a 3 hr flight away), it is way better and I have a girl that is way more loving and understanding.

My exp:

* My gf of a very short relationship ended it after we were talking some drunk stories from years ago. She said she did not like my taste in friends after being in a toxic relationship where she said the guy abused her but yet did not end it. Oh and her stories were worse like hers involved drugs and assault
* One situationship that was a 2 week relationship ended. Me being concerned for her safety caused the girl to basically punish me and breadcrumb me for 8 weeks where 3 days was ghosting. She would cancel meetups about 2 hrs before the agreed time, say she will call but never did. Even trying to give me anxiety by saying ""I want to share my thoughts"" then would never do it. And kept saying it was all her stress with work. I revenge ghosted her when she said she had no time to date and making me wait constantly. She then couldn't handle that lol. When I ended it, she wrote 1500 word message that was 14 paragraphs. Her parents warned me that she does silent treatment and such.
* One toxic girl, I met her once at a mall. We were talking about the same tv shows, morning routine and everything. She wanted to meet again and said ""next weekend."" Then she ended up being full on toxic like she complained that I didn't know hindi, called me childish (she was talking about the same things as me), her mom was teasing me for not knowing Hindi as well. I told them ""Lmao I was raised in western countries and not India. I have a good career and am definitely not childish based on everything I am doing. If you are judging someone for not knowing a language or their taste in movies then good luck trying to find someone, you'll need it""
* Two were obsessed with getting married already.
* One girl I met, I am pretty sure she was using me for citizenship cause she wanted to go to my home country cause her sister is living there. She kept talking controversial things like she was full on talking about charlie kirk assassination and trump and whatnot. I was a bit putoff because i have a hatred of politics. And in the cab ride. She was full on talking about her period and ""the 4 stages"" of girls getting her period. And im like ""why is she talking about this full on?""
   * She wanted to meet for coffee to discuss how we haven't been emotionally vulnerable after 3 meets. Then cancelled last minute... She then ghosted for no reason but I didn't care at that point
* One girl i matched with had 4 boyfriends from UAE and she told me all of them cheated on her (more directed to the guy's cheating culture here)

I've gotten some extra fruit, especially things like grapes,  prunes and dates, and I'm waiting on some psyllium husk to arrive. Hoping that will move things along, combined with drinking a lot more water.  I was averaging about 800ml water a day plus 3+ teas or coffees.

Hard do-not-recommend for my fellow autists, particularly those who are sober - it’s holidaying on hard mode…

As we know, autistic people love a plan. Since booking the trip months prior, I’d viewed it through the lens of a training regimen, easy to orchestrate and centred around my great loves: carbs and rest. My partner is an ardent birthday shirker, so we’d planned to do a low-key dinner together on his birthday, after my race. Not four unscheduled days of tourism abyss. 

Given the race-dream died so close to its realisation, there was no time to rejig the calendar to adjust to this new plan. Error #1. 

Error #2 made itself known very quickly. As the island was super busy due to the half-marathon (should’ve been a warning in itself), we opted for a mid-range apartment hotel — at still over €100 a night. When we arrived, I had to actively unclench my jaw upon the realisation that I’d booked us a room in a shared apartment. Me - the woman who would rather starve during the day back in university halls lest she bump into someone in the kitchen. 

We took Error #2 in our stride and tried to make the best of it. After all, it’s hard to feel forced into small talk in an apartment with people who don’t necessarily speak your language. But the only other language in which I am fluent - routine - also became collateral damage. 

I am not fit for humankind until I have had a coffee, a read and undisturbed toilet time. There wasn’t proper coffee, there was a hideously uncomfortable metal ‘headboard’ unfit for reading, and the bathroom was, obviously, shared. Not off to the best start. 

I’m not sure whether I’m just perpetually riddled with anxiety, but the first day or two of any trip is always accompanied by a mild dose of derealisation for me. Everything feels a little uncanny valley until my brain has had a chance to recalibrate — something especially noticeable when you’re holidaying somewhere so beautiful it looks like a film set. Cue the low-level nausea and dizziness. 

Thankfully, C had booked us onto a free walking tour, which, as long as I'm armed with sunglasses, is actually a great way to get the lay of the land and stop feeling like you’re living in your own dreamscape. This was probably the highlight of the trip. Shout out to Venice Walking Tour.

After that, everything started to go downhill. Except for C accidentally butting his chair into the canal when standing up to pay for lunch. That was fucking brilliant. 

The only thing I’d really wanted to try whilst we were there was a stonking good lasagne. So I’d done the research and we ended up at an incredibly busy tourist-trap restaurant that had had great reviews. Can you smell Error #3 yet?

Once we’d ascertained that the queue outside the restaurant did indeed include those with reservations, the alcoholic’s rendering of the Grim Reaper approached us in a Maitre’d’s suit, laden with glasses of prosecco. Each of the other punters gladly received their glass - an apology for having to wait - whilst time seemed to stand still as I internally begged C to decline on our behalf. Mercifully, he did. 

But something in me crumbled. I’ve been sober just under sixteen months now, and I’m usually pretty good at batting away unexpected offers of alcohol. This time, something in my often ‘othered’ psyche couldn’t handle seeing every other person gleefully sipping their glasses, able to enjoy the spoils of being so mildly put out on their lovely holidays with their little treat, getting to be so normal.

I walked away crying.

I have just been buying green tea from the grocery store, and have tried three pretty generic brands. Am I having an allergic reaction to green tea, or is it just poor quality green tea?

They manage those properties and alongside that they have a full fledged short term rental business model... 
One of the most lucrative things is, you don't have to own a property to start an airbnb Business...

They source the property, furnish it, manage it, bring customers and generate you a 3-4% take home profit every single month.. All in a 2 million PKR budget.

They legit showed me receipts if generating 1.7 million take home profit for a customer in a single month (on a 1CR investment)...

It was a grand, hot property in Murree.

Your 2m PKR ( or amount you want to invest) goes into sourcing/furnishing/managing/marketing your unit and providing you 3-4% take home every single month starting from 61st day.

They provide you transparent data dashboard access where you can get a snapshot of the state of affairs of your airbnb business...

If you want to get started, i can set you up with the dude for a physical meetup over coffee. (They have a physical office in Johar Town)

So, I (25F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been dating for 6 years already. But the last good times I recall are about a year ago. The last year has been absolute hell because of his anorexia.

I knew he had anorexia as a teen, but when we met, he was already recovered. At some point he reached highest weight he's ever been - 70kg at 164 cm. He was devastated and started losing rapidly. I always told him that he was perfect to me, didn't need to lose any weight, but if he wanted to - we could do it together in a healthy way. But he didn't listen. That was 2 years ago. Now he's on his death bed, weighing just 25 kg - and that is AFTER he gained a bit at the hospital. Now the doctors think he can voluntarily refuse treatment, which I think is seriously braindead. HE'S FUCKING DYING. 

My everyday life is hell. I constantly check his heartbeat or his breathing during the night too, I make him wear adult diapers cause he shits or pisses himself quite often, and sometimes I help him get to the bathroom. I make sure to shower him like doctors told me to, cause his skin is very sensitive and showering by himself is a big strain on his heart. I also have to help him walk, sit up, do anything really. He can't even change his clothes alone. He doesn't drink water if I don't force him, he doesn't do anything but watch shows all day. I started to work from home just to take care of him full time. My friends have drifted away cause I can't leave the house for long without worrying that he'll fall over or kill himself without me. One time I left for groceries and he started walking around the house trying to find a scale, but he fell over on the stairs and broke his arm. I found him sobbing on the floor when I got back home. After that, I video call him every time I leave and I watch what he's doing and have him talk to me. I also try to feed him shakes, only liquids like doctors told me, but he refuses to drink anything but black coffee. I refuse to give it to him because I'm afraid for his heart, but he always throws a fit over it. When I bring him shakes, he spills them on me most of the time. When I do manage to make him intake ANYTHING, he usually throws up, or shits himself. So, most of the time, I have to clean up either vomit or shit.

I've just started feeling this disgust towards him. This doesn't feel like a relationship anymore, we haven't kissed in over a year. Hell, I don't even wanna kiss him. He sometimes tells me he loves me, and he tried to kiss me once when I was showering him. But I genuinely can't. I just see him as my patient, I do want the best for him, I WANT him to recover, but I don't think I have feelings for him anymore, and I feel miserable because of it. I'm such a disloyal woman:(",2,1762248925.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.75,False
1oo342l,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1oo342l/continued_vyvanse_not_working_suddenly/,CONTINUED - Vyvanse not working suddenly,"**Initial text I put down:**

So, to preface this, I have been taking Vyvanse 30mg now for 4 days.

On the days I take it in the morning (7.30am) with no food, it works really well (starts in 1hr) but stops at around 12pm. However, on the second day of taking it without coffee (some unpleasant side effects) it worked at maybe 70% efficiency.

Now if I take it on a full stomach (protein meal in morning before) then there is literally no effect, and I feel the same adhd symptoms in full force again.

I do not know what i should do or how to take it and my Psych is on leave till next year. Trying to get a stand in Psych to have a session and discuss this.

What are your thoughts and how can I simply make it work for at least 10 hours (8-6pm) so I can actually function on a normal work day?

Thank you for reading and your replies.

  
**New findings:**

I have gone to my gp as recommended by my psychiatrist and he has prescribed me from 30mg to 60mg (2x tablets each morning), which was discussed also in the initial post.

*This is the first day after and:*  
\- I had it on a half empty stomach (7.45am) with a tiny amount of coffee so I do not withdraw.  
\- Started working around 8.45am  
\- Seemed to peak at 9.30  
\- Effects almost worn off at 11.30am  
\- Did not get any work done and have just been my usual ""bouncing from one thing to another without finishing it"" self

The GP said the higher dose is supposed to make it last longer but it seems to have almost had the opposite effect. Could this just be an adjustment thing? What am I doing wrong?

Thanks everyone for replying previously as it helps me figure this stuff out.

It was good deal and it is for my spouse anniversary.

Now im looking grinder to pair with it. As new to making coffee (just regular drinkers), i have no idea what to buy. 

What is in my mind (just because its looks/brand)

1. LM Pico - Same brand, can pair with acaia for BbW

2. Acaia Orbit - It can paired with Acaia is a bonus, plus looks like weber

3. Mahlkoning X64 SD - Looks nice, for SD

4. Mahlkoning X65 GBW - My spouse mention one of her dreams is to do coffee for events/wedding. Thus having this can be future ready but it is overkill setup

We will make at least 4 cups a day, might have some guest later on. 

Appreciate any comments on these for and reason behind it or any other options. I am new and my priority for grinder are

1. Looks, as i know i wont make good coffee, as long it is nice to drink it is good.

2. Less maintenance, not  complicate, grind and go.

3. Repeatability, same setup give same results everytime.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ilves Tampere vs. FC Inter Turku: A Finnish Frenzy of Futility and Finesse**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the final act of the Finnish Veikkausliiga season—a clash of second-place pride and post-championship apathy. Ilves Tampere, the hounds of Helsinki, face FC Inter Turku, the hares who already won the race, in a match that’s as thrilling as watching a Finnish sauna compete in a snowman contest. Let’s parse the odds, digest the drama, and crown a winner with the precision of a Helsinki cartographer.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Mathematically Sound Case for Boredom

The betting market treats this like a nap-inducing spreadsheet. Inter Turku, the home team, is the slight favorite at decimal odds of **2.2–2.3** (implied probability: **45–47%**), while Ilves checks in at **2.65–2.8** (**37–38%**). The draw? A paltry **3.5–3.75** (**26–27%**), suggesting bookmakers view this as a “someone wins, but we’re not sure who” affair. The total goals market leans **under 3.5** (odds: **1.62–1.65**, implied **61–62%**), which makes sense—this isn’t a fireworks show, it’s a Finnish winter: cold, methodical, and full of people politely avoiding eye contact.

**Ilves Tampere** is the team equivalent of a GPS navigating to a closed restaurant: *“Recalculating… but also, why are you still driving?”* They’re three points behind champions KuPS, but since the title is already sewn up, their quest is now about finishing second. Recent form? They just beat HJK Helsinki 3-1, thanks to Congolese striker Jardell Kanga, who’s as reliable as a sauna heater in January. But let’s be real: Ilves is like a Finnish *sisu*—they’ll keep grinding, but the prize is already out of reach.

**FC Inter Turku**, meanwhile, is the team equivalent of a Helsinki barista on their last coffee of the day: *“We’ve secured the win, now please just leave so I can close early.”* They drew their previous ma

1oo2ygf,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1oo2ygf/how_journaling_literally_rewires_your_brain_the/,How journaling literally rewires your brain: the self-discovery habit no one taught us at school,"Everyone's talking about therapy or mindfulness right now. But there’s one low-key practice that keeps showing up in conversations with creatives, founders, and even neuroscientists: journaling. It’s wild how common it is once you start looking. People use it to survive breakups. Rebuild confidence. Track their mental health. Clear emotional clutter. But most of us weren’t really taught how to journal in a useful way, let alone why it's so effective. This post is a deep dive into what good journaling actually looks like, why it works on a neurological level, and some underrated formats that go way beyond “dear diary.” None of this is fluff. I pulled these insights from clinical research, books by real experts, and podcast episodes that weren’t aiming for a viral soundbite. The goal is to stop blaming ourselves for emotional chaos and start using journaling as a tool for clarity, healing, and self-direction.

One reason journaling works so well is that it interrupts the mental loop of rumination. Dr. James Pennebaker, a psychology professor at UT Austin, ran a bunch of studies showing that expressive writing can reduce symptoms of trauma, anxiety, and even improve immune function. In his original experiments, participants who wrote about emotionally charged experiences for just 15 minutes a day reported noticeable improvements in mood and clarity after only a few days. What’s fascinating is that they didn’t need to write something beautiful or coherent, just honest. This is what makes journaling different from overthinkingt gets ideas out of you and onto the page, so your brain can chill for a second. It doesn’t even have to make sense

But journaling isn't just venting. Used right, it becomes a form of cognitive reappraisal. You can retrain your brain to see your life differently. Neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, in her book \*How Emotions Are Made\*, explains that our feelings aren’t just reactions—they're constructed through interpretation. Journaling lets you edit that process in real time. You can take an intrusive thought like “I always ruin things” and reframe it into “I panicked today because I care too much, not because I’m broken.” Big shift. And that shift, practiced over time, changes your internal narrative.



Here’s a trick that helped me actually stick with it: reduce friction. Instead of treating journaling like a chore, make it playful. Like, instead of writing a wall of text, try using \*\*haikus\*\* to capture your mood. It's faster, it makes you think in patterns, and it gets you out of perfectionist mode. Or grab your phone and take a photo every day of something that reflects your emotional state. Not for Instagram. Just for you. Call it \*\*photographic journaling\*\*. These creative constraints activate different neural pathways and make journaling less like a task and more like a dialogue with yourself.

Another approach that’s backed by research is gratitude journaling. Super basic, yeah, but effective. A paper published in \*The Journal of Positive Psychology\* found that people who wrote about things they were thankful for just once a week reported higher well-being and lower symptoms of depression than those who didn’t. The key is to be specific. “I’m grateful for coffee” is nice, but “I’m grateful for the quiet moment between my first sip and the chaos of the day” hits harder and rewires your focus.

If you want to go deeper into the science and philosophy of introspection, read \*\*The Body Keeps the Score\*\* by Bessel van der Kolk. This is not just a book about trauma. It’s a must-read if you want to understand how your mind and body hold onto stories you haven't fully processed. Dr. van der Kolk is a leading trauma researcher, and his research has changed how therapy is practiced. The chapters on memory and narrative healing will make you look at journaling like an intervention, not just a hobby. This book will make you question everything you think you know about your past.

Another insanely good read is \*\*Wintering\*\* by Katherine May. It’s not “self-help” in the usual sense. No step-by-step fixes. Just beautifully written reflections on how we move through hard seasons. May connects journaling, solitude, cold weather, and creative rest in a way that feels like poetry but also gives genuine comfort. It’s the best book I’ve ever read about emotional healing that doesn't feel like it’s trying to fix you.

For audio learners, the podcast \*\*Therapy Chat\*\* with Laura Reagan (LCSW-C) is gold. She brings on actual licensed therapists to talk through journaling, trauma-informed care, and emotional regulation without the TikTok-style overgeneralizations. Look for the episodes on narrative therapy and somatic journaling. They’re surprisingly actionable.

Another gem is the \*\*The One You Feed\*\* podcast. It blends psychology and spirituality without being woo-woo. There’s one interview with psychologist Rick Hanson that digs into how repeated journaling rewires your neural circuitry so you’re not just tracking emotions but actively shaping them over time. It's about mental fitness, not just reflection.



If you're already using mindfulness apps and want to layer in journaling, \*\*Finch\*\* is underrated. It lets you set affirmations, journal moods, and track goals with a pet-bird avatar that evolves as you grow. Strangely addictive. It’s gamified in a non-cringey way and actually helps you recover from stress loops.

Then there’s \*\*BeFreed\*\*, which feels like the future of introspective learning. It’s an AI-powered app developed by a team from Columbia University that turns deep-dive knowledge—books, expert interviews, research, life storiesnto custom learning podcasts. You can choose how long you want to listen (10, 20, or 40 minutes) and even pick the type of voice guiding you. What makes it powerful for journaling is that it builds your learning roadmap over time based on what you reflect on, listen to, and react to. Some days, it drops prompts that feel like they were pulled straight from your head. It also has an insane book and podcast library, including all the books I just mentioned above, so you can keep deepening your introspection journey without switching platforms.

There’s no “right” way to journal. What matters is that it’s real. If a sentence feels cringey, keep it. If what comes out is messy, that’s good. You’re not writing for likes. You’re writing to hear the parts of yourself that don’t get airtime. That’s how the healing happens.",1,1762248271.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

I did all three standards starting off with calculus. I feel somewhat confident as I had an idea of what was going on and cooked on the coffee question. I got t=100 for min and compared to what everyone is saying, apparently it is right so that’s at least one excellence mark. I think I’ll get at least a merit for calc so I’m not too worried. I think I spent at least an hour and a half on this paper which leads me and hour and a half left for algebra and calculus. From doing past papers for algebra, I was somewhat confident I could at least get a merit or possibly an excellence. However as soon as I saw the first question I didn’t know how to solve it and freaked out. My eyes scanned to the other questions and I was really confused and literally had a mind blank on how to do any of these questions. I feel like they weren’t similar to previous years except for the solutions question where you had to reverse it into a quadratic and subbing in n for 5^x which I know how to do but I did it wrong in the exam which is frustrating. So that is another excellence of the chart. I am really upset with myself as I know what I performed wasn’t up to my ability and skills. From seeing the leaked answers and solutions from another reddit post, I’m positive I got NA as I only got 2 achieved questions right. I’ve never gotten a NA as I’m somewhat an average student with mostly merit and excellence credits with only 2 achieved credits this year. I’m really dissapoimted and frustrated with myself and I have no motivation to study for my other exams. I felt like it was incredibly hard compared to past years exams and for the golf question, I have never learnt that topic apart from seeing it from a tutorial from infnityplusone which I kind of recall understanding it but I definitely got that one wrong.

Why, when I think about all the arguments we had, all I want to do is run into your arms and pick you up...tell you things are alright?

Why do I miss everything all at once, every little thing you did, every dish you made for me, every coffee we had, every kiss we shared?

Why do we not agree to disagree, fight so passionately instead...when we both know our arguments only hurt us and discourage you?

Why do I not remember your beautiful face when we argue, the pretty eyes I fell for, the laugh I cherish instead of the cry I despise?

Why does the distance feel far, even when we are so close? Why do you ignore my calls, ignore my texts, and say you loathe me when in reality you love me?

Maybe I should have treated you like the delicate flower you are...maybe just maybe if there was a time machine, I could set it right.

But no... it wouldn't be the same - arguments bring us closer, they say.

Why is it that I feel so terribly, sickly, and drained when we fight? Is it my love vanishing, or is it my love growing?

Hey RetirementReady Crew! 👋

Anyone else feel like they could practically fuse with their couch this fall? Between the shorter days and the…well, let’s just say my motivation levels aren't exactly sky high. 😅 I know I’m not alone!

But! We're not about that life, are we? We’re about making this chapter the *best* chapter, and that means shaking things up and finding ways to feel energized, even when the weather is saying ""stay inside!"" So, I've been doing some digging, and I've got three *unexpected* hobby ideas that might just be the ticket. And yes, I promise, no pickleball involved! (Unless you *really* love pickleball. Then, you do you!)

Ready to ditch the Netflix binge and rediscover your zest? Here we go:

*   **Guerilla Gardening:** Okay, hear me out. ""We believe in strongest people."" And this is where you can prove it! (https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb) Think planting wildflowers in neglected patches of your neighborhood, or even just tossing some seed bombs in empty lots. It’s a sneaky way to get some fresh air, connect with nature, and brighten someone's day – plus, a little bit of ""sticking it to the man"" always feels good, right? 😂 Imagine transforming a dull, gray corner into a burst of color. I'm telling you, it's surprisingly satisfying!

*   **Amateur Radio (Ham Radio):** I know, I know, it sounds like something your grandpa did. But trust me on this one. Ham radio is experiencing a huge resurgence! It's a fantastic way to connect with people all over the world, learn about electronics and technology, and even prepare for emergencies. Plus, you can even build your own equipment, which is a super cool challenge. It’s like having a global pen pal network…with gadgets! Who knew?

*   **Urban Sketching:** Forget perfect masterpieces. Urban sketching is all about capturing the everyday beauty around you, in a quick, loose, and fun way. Think sketching your local coffee shop, a quirky building in your neighborhood, or even just a cool-looking tree in the park. All you need is a sketchbook, a pen, and a willingness to embrace imperfection. Seriously, it’s incredibly meditative and a great way to see your surroundings in a whole new light. I started with stick figures and now... well, I still draw a lot of stick figures, but at least they're *stylish* stick figures! 😉

So, what do you think? Any of these spark your interest? Or maybe you have your own unexpected hobby ideas for reclaiming your energy this fall? I’m genuinely curious to hear what you’re up to! What's YOUR plan to embrace the season without becoming one with the couch cushions? Maybe learning a new language? Volunteering? Starting a podcast about your cat?

Just throwing it out there... 🤔

I got to Delhi Saturday bright eyed and bushy tailed for a 3-week solo trip. I have done months solo in SEA in the past and loved it. However, I think my hostel had fake reviews, as I showed up in the sketchiest neighborhood I've ever seen. I proceeded to crash, wake up and try to Uber to coffee. I was chased out of the neighborhood by stray dogs and fell and scraped myself up badly. The experience has shaken me...

I am thinking of switching my return flight to a one week trip instead of 3, as I have a layover in Delhi on the 8th anyways... 

I was also involved in a minor car crash with an Uber that had no seatbelts. Just bad omens in Delhi. I am in Varanasi now, hoping it gets better but I think I should just cut my losses and enjoy the teaching to be grateful I live in Canada.

What are your thoughts? I wanted this trip to be incredibly peaceful and spiritual, but now I am on edge and jumpy, wishing I was home. It's not like I've never solo traveled before, this is totally unique to me. India is just a different beast, I think. Don't want sunk cost/shame of failure to get me - I can book time off work in the future. But I also fear regret, or I wouldn't be asking others lol.

Appreciate any comments or tips.

But what if there was a better way? A way to have a stylish, cozy home *without* the constant worry and cleanup?

Enter the hero of modern home decor: **the non-slip machine washable rug.**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=non-slip%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

This guide is your one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about these game-changing floor coverings. We're diving deep into why they're a must-have, what to look for when you buy, and how to keep them looking brand new.

## Why You Need a Non-Slip Machine Washable Rug in Your Life

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=non-slip%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

If you're on the fence, let's talk about the transformative benefits. This isn't just about convenience; it's about upgrading your entire home experience.

### Unmatched Convenience and Hygiene
The most obvious benefit is right in the name. Mess happens? Don't panic. Just toss your rug in the wash. This isn't just about stains; it's about deep-cleaning dust, dander, allergens, and bacteria that settle deep into rug fibers. For anyone with allergies, this is a total game-changer. A clean rug means cleaner air and a healthier home.

### Safety First for Every Family Member
A rug that slips and slides is a tripping hazard waiting to happen. This is especially dangerous for kids learning to walk, elderly family members, and even pets who love to zoom around the house. A high-quality non-slip machine washable rug comes with a durable rubber or TPE backing that grips the floor, providing stability and peace of mind.

### The Perfect Solution for High-Traffic Areas
Some parts of your home work harder than others. The kitchen, the entryway, the hallway, the bathroom—these are the zones where dirt and spills are part of daily life.
*   **Kitchen Rugs:** A cushiony, washable rug can save your back and be cleaned of every last dropped piece of food.
*   **Entryway Runners:** A washable runner is the first line of defense against mud, snow, and whatever else the world tracks in.
*   **Bath Mats:** These have *always* been washable, but modern designs are just as stylish as any other rug, with the non-slip grip being non-negotiable.

### A Lifesaver for Pet Owners and Parents
If you have a four-legged friend or a tiny human, you're already nodding along. Muddy paws, spilled juice, ""accidents,"" and pet hair are just part of the package. Instead of fretting over every little mess, you can simply strip the rug and throw it in the laundry. This transforms your relationship with your floors from one of stress to one of pure, unadulterated sanity.

## What to Look for When Buying a Non-Slip Machine Washable Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=non-slip%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

Ready to shop? Great! But not all washable rugs are created equal. Here’s your checklist for finding a truly durable, high-quality rug.

### The Backing is Key
This is the most crucial feature for the ""non-slip"" part.
*   **Integrated Backing:** Look for rugs with a rubber, thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), or latex backing that is firmly attached to the rug itself. This ensures it won't peel off after a few washes.
*   **Rug Pads:** Some standard rugs are marketed as ""machine washable"" but require you to remove a separate non-slip pad first. While this works, it's less convenient. An integrated backing is the superior, hassle-free choice.

### Material Matters
The fabric determines the rug's feel, durability, and how well it washes.
*   **Cotton:** Soft, breathable, and often gets softer with each wash. Great for a casual, cozy vibe.
*   **Chenille:** Known for its plush, velvety feel. Incredibly soft but can take longer to dry.
*   **Microfiber & Polyester:** Highly durable, stain-resistant, and quick-drying. These are often the workhorse materials for family-friendly and pet-friendly rugs.

### Pile Height and Weave
You generally want a low-pile or flatweave rug.
*   **Low-Pile:** The fibers are short and tight. This prevents dirt from getting ground in deep and makes the rug much easier for your washing machine to handle. It also ensures it can fit under doors without getting stuck.
*   **Flatweave:** Woven on a loom, these rugs have no pile and are very thin. They are some of the easiest to wash and dry, making them ideal for entryways and dining rooms.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=non-slip%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

### Size and Shape
It sounds simple, but measure your space before you buy! Think about the room's function.
*   **Runners** are perfect for hallways and kitchens.
*   **Round rugs** can soften a square room or define a small seating area.
*   **Rectangular rugs** are the classic choice for living rooms and bedrooms.

## Caring for Your Machine Washable Rug: Pro Tips

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=non-slip%20machine%20washable%20rugs)

Follow these steps to extend the life of your rug and keep it looking its best.

*   **Read the Label (*Seriously!*):** Every rug is different. The manufacturer's instructions are your bible. Follow them for water temperature, cycle type, and drying instructions.
*   **Shake It Out First:** Before washing, take the rug outside and give it a good shake to dislodge loose dirt, hair, and debris.
*   **Pre-Treat Stains:** For tough spills, use a gentle stain remover or a mixture of vinegar and water on the spot before tossing it in the machine.
*   **Washing Best Practices:** Use a **gentle cycle** with **cold water** and a **mild detergent**. Avoid using bleach, as it can break down the fibers and damage the backing.
*   **Drying Do's and Don'ts:** Air drying is the safest and best method to prevent shrinkage. If you must use a dryer, use the **lowest heat setting possible** or an air-only cycle. High heat is the enemy of a machine washable rug.

## Final Thoughts: A Worthy Investment for Your Home

A non-slip machine washable rug is more than just a piece of decor; it's an investment in your home's cleanliness, safety, and your own peace of mind. It allows you to live freely, embrace style, and let go of the fear of life's little (and big) messes.

My (24F)  boyfriend (24M) and I have been dating for 8 months, and before that we were friends for 4 years with him sometimes living in the same town as me and most of the times living away. Our relationship has been really good so far and pretty normal I guess, except for the arguments we've had over him thinking I'm going to cheat on him. 

I want to make clear I've never cheated on anyone before, never cheated on my boyfriend and as far as I can tell I don't think I've done anything to warrant any suspicion. I dont talk to or keep contact with anyone I've ever slept with or dated before, I give him full access to my phone and I spend 99% of my time with him as most of the time we've been dating I've spent living with him and we literally spend every day together. Before that I was living for a couple months at my parents house after I got evicted which was just at the start of our relationship and when we were apart we would literally spend all day texting each other and call multiple times a day and the longest I'd go without talking to him on the phone was like an hour at most.

I've really enjoyed living with him but it started becoming a problem in September when I wanted to go back home. The context was we'd had a bad argument during a night we went out drinking and I don't want to go into detail but the one thing to note is I didn't cheat on him nor did it have to do with anything like cheating, but anyways after that we were both pretty messed up and traumatised and he ended up needing to go to a&e for mental health stuff and because he got beat up (not by me, he got in a street brawl). I stayed a few days after with him to make sure he got a phone since he lost his and that he could make it to his first appointment that week with the mental health people but I wanted some space from him and to reconnect with myself a bit so I decided I'd go back home. 

When I told him I was thinking of going back home for a week or a couple weeks to do some self-care he got really off with me. He then accused me that I was lying to him and secretly trying to go party behind his back and I'd probably end up cheating on him. I was really offended because these accusations feel like they came out of nowhere. We argued about it a bit and talked about it and I told him I'd try to go stay with my parents instead as they live in a different town to my flat and he insisted that the town I live in is a ""party town"" and he didn't trust me being there on my own. I stayed with my parents for a couple days but found it insufferable and I couldn't relax like I wanted to so I told him I just wanted to go back to my own home and just be in my room. 

I got back home and the first couple days I met up with my two girl friends during the day for a coffee and caught up with them. After the second day I think it was I called him in the evening and he was put off by me and acting distant and cold and told me he doesn't want to worry about what I'm doing when I'm not with him so he wasn't going to talk to me or text me or call me at all until I came back. The next couple days I didn't hear from him once. On the second day he did pop back up to ask me if I wanted to talk. We talked about it but couldn't come to an agreement. I felt like he was being cohesively controlling and jealous and just rude for accusing me that I was going to cheat on him with no like real reason why he thinks that. He insisted it's just how he feels and he couldn't control it. 

Long story short I put my foot down because after a few days of this I was feeling incredibly sick from the stress, I'd even thrown up at one point and I told him I couldn't handle this anymore and it wasn't fair that I had gone home specifically to catch a break and relax and he was stressing me out more. So I told him I was ready to break up if he didn't relent on this. He then dropped it and apologised and we moved on.

Fast forward to now, I was on the phone to my best friend and we were catching up about what we did over Halloween. There's a lot of context here I want to address so I'm gonna just list it out:

- my best friend and her boyfriend are two of my closest friends I've known for 4 years now.
- they live in a different town now for the last 2 years.
- we have a tradition from the first year we were friends that we always celebrate Halloween together or Samhain as we're both into paganism. 
- our Halloween celebration normally consists of making a big ritualistic pot of soup, making a fire and doing other little witchy rituals.
- our plan this year was to do the same thing and we both insisted on not drinking for our own reasons.
- the original plan was me and my boyfriend would be travelling down anyways around Halloween for a funeral we are attending that was meant to be the 30th of October 
- the funeral got rescheduled to the 9th so I canceled on Halloween because I couldn't afford to do two cross country trips in the same month and had business I needed to conduct up here. 
- to make up for cancelling on our plans we arranged that after the funeral I'd pop over to stay with them a few days and we can do a late samhain thing. I invited my boyfriend to come multiple times and he always said no because he'd be too busy. 

So back to what happened, my friend caught me up on her plans and told me that a few days before Halloween her and her boyfriend went out clubbing and drinking and she told me they ended up having a threesome with one of our mutual friends. She clarified that even though they are monogamous they have a rule with each other than holidays like Halloween or birthdays or new years is an exception. I didn't think much of this, the extent that I knew about their relationship is that they were polyamorous before they started dating and then when they got together they became monogamous for each other as they're very serious and looking to get married soon kind of relationship. I knew they were still flexible sometimes but I never knew specifically the rule only applied to celebratory occasions.

After I get off the phone with her I meet back up with my boyfriend and I spill the tea and tell him what my friend told me about the threesome they had. He finishes doing his work and then asks if we wanna go for a walk. On this walk he then brings it up as an issue. He starts off by saying that he didn't know my friends were polyamorous and he didn't feel comfortable with me staying with them. He said he find it very suspicious that the fact that I have a tradition of spending Halloween with them every year and that they supposedly are polyamorous during celebrations, so he's decided that means I must have been planning to sleep with them. He then said I lied to him, and that I should have told him sooner about this. But I never knew that specific detail until just then to which I told him about as more of a piece of gossip then anything serious because I don't think it really affects us. 

It's really thrown me off because he's making a connection between two things that to me are completely separate and it feels perverse. I want to make it very clear I have never been attracted to my friends, we've never ever flirted or been overly affectionate and there's never been any romantic or sexual tension between us. They're slightly older than me and I see them more as older siblings or parents and I know they see me the same way as platonic family. The way he's tried to twist this into a weird perverted arrangement is really offending me because this is my best friends were talking about and it's turning something that's always been wholesome and innocent and trying to make it weird. 

He insists I lied to him and should have told him that they are more polyamorous on holidays. He even kept referring to them as polamorous which I had to correct him multiple times they are monogamous. I don't think having a threesome once a year makes you polyamorous. He thinks I'm lying and I told him I didn't even know they had that specific kind of arrangement and he doesn't believe I'm telling the truth. I don't know what else to do then seeing as he won't believe me or trust me enough to take my word on things. I also don't see how it would matter even if they were polyamorous because I have never had and never will have that kind of relationship with them. 

So I'm looking for advice on how to deal with this because the fact he insists I lied to him and didn't tell him the truth, when I've told him exactly everything I know just as I've learnt it, but he thinks I'm lying. ",1,1762246848.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Fuck I don't even know if there's anyone left outside this damn building. The last time I looked out the window everything was dark, but not in the usual way one would expect the early hours of the morning to be. It was oppressive…. It was unnatural. No matter how much I strained my eyes and begged a god, that would shun me as a heretic, for mercy there was no denying the abyss that pressed against the windowpane. It was as if I was floating in the deepest reaches of a space devoid of stars and here I stood, nothing but a vacuous pit of questions.

Completely and utterly alone. 

I'm writing this solely because I don’t know what else to do. I’m Hoping someone is still out there, no… needing there to be someone out there to tell me this is some kind of fucked up joke or that maybe I’m in the midst of some kind of breakdown. Anything to help me understand. 


Let me explain from the beginning, maybe recounting the last two days will help me get a better grasp on the reality I'm facing.  The funny thing is, it started exactly the same as every other day. Same monotonous routine; wake up at 5:10 each morning, adorn my high vis and steel toe boots, catch the 6:10 train only to find myself at the locked gates of my place of work not even forty minutes after leaving my house. 

Same route, same times and even the same faces passed me by on my commute. It had been dark out, a little cold and a little damp but everything was… normal… 

I was the first to arrive at work most days which granted me access to a set of the building's keys shortly after my employment. So it wasn't unusual to be the only one squinting under the dim flicker of an overhead lamp post with the cold biting at my fingertips, as I struggled to pry the stubborn metal of the gates open as quickly as possible in hopes of finding reprieve from the winter air. I didn't even have an inkling anything was wrong until a good thirty minutes after I had arrived. 

I work in a fairly small warehouse for an independent enterprise in a small non descript town. Just your average location for any average joe. The building has a small office space above the warehouse and the day to day workload was never that intense. In fact most days were a slow slog to 3:30, but the small team of people I grew to know helped the time pass. 

Normally within ten to twenty minutes of my arrival other members of staff would start to trickle in, accompanied by the general groan of sleepiness and resentment for being stuck in what was essentially a fucking ice box all day instead of wrapped up in bed with a warm cup of coffee. 

The one shitty heater the company provided us smelt as though it was ready to catch fire at any moment and yet we would all huddle round it desperately whenever we got the chance. So even the temperature hadn't seemed strange at the time. I can feel it now though… how it's slowly creeping under my skin and nesting in my bones. 

I’m concerned about how much colder it’s going to get the longer I’m trapped here. 

After I had deactivated the alarm and made my first cup of coffee for the day I made my way toward the door, the large windows overseeing the warehouse loomed in my peripheral, which always did a great job at freaking me the fuck out. You see, the lights for the warehouse itself are automated and will only come on when it senses movement, so whenever I make my way toward the door in the mornings I refuse to look through those damn windows. Call it an overactive imagination or watching too many horror films in my spare time but I didn't like looking into a pit of darkness especially when no one else was in the building.  An irrational part of my mind would always supply that someone could be watching me on the other side of the glass. Stupid right? Now I kind of wish there was. I haven't seen a single soul in 42 hours which is fucking insane. 

This whole situation is making me feel insane. 

I remember the confusion that I had felt when no one had shown up after I had assumed a good thirty minutes had passed. I had glanced around the space for a while, pacing around the staff room and warehouse office wondering if I could see any signs of a new arrival and when I had finally begun to drive myself a little crazy doing so I fished my phone from my pocket and stared down in a detached kind of shock when my phone flashed the numbers 6:30am back at me. The time I had first arrived at work. There was no way. I had been here for at least twenty to thirty minutes. So the time staring back at me must have been wrong. Now as much as this had sent a tiny shiver of unease through my spine It wasn't unexplainable and so I didn't ponder on it much, still too perplexed as to why no one else was here yet. 

It wasn't a bank holiday, it was the middle of the week and there was no indication as to why no one else had shown up. Perhaps there had been an accident and people were stuck in traffic?. 

So I waited for roughly another thirty minutes. Idly staring at my phone screen in mild fascination. Time unchanging. It was at this point I really started to feel antsy, fingers dancing along the sides of my phone, unable to refrain from fidgeting where I sat. Maybe I should just leave? No one was answering their phones and the longer I sat there, the more on edge I had become. I felt silly for feeling so spooked at the time, telling myself that if anything it was a day off from work and that I had probably missed an email about the place being shut for the day. 

The low melody of changes by Black Sabbath danced in the otherwise still space between the walls of this place, offering a small salvation from the eerie feeling that accompanied me as I logged into my work email on the laptop at my makeshift desk, that sat in the corner of the warehouse. The red laser of the scanner hummed quietly as it projected its dim light across the white walls opposite the computer. 

There had been no email. The calls I had tried to make had gone from ringing out to not going through at all from my end. It was as if the entire place became a deadzone. No signal and no wifi connection. 

The open space that sat oppressively against my back felt almost suffocating the longer I swivelled nervously in the desk chair. Fuck this right? Something didn't feel right and the longer I stewed in that feeling the heavier it got. So with a shaky exhale I pushed myself back abruptly from the laptop and gathered my bag and headphones from under the desk. If no one was coming then what was I doing here?  I knew the address of my work friend Natalie, I could swing by and see what was going on at a more reasonable hour of the day. There must have been some kind of announcement I missed and whilst everyone else was at home I was here like a complete fucking idiot waiting around. 

There was still a part of me that hesitated at the prospect of leaving. What if I got in trouble? What if after I leave people do start to show up and then I'm the one that gets questioned about my impromptu absence? 

Well it turns out that none of that mattered because when my eyes landed on the glass door of the entrance all I could see was a thick blanket of obsidian. I stood there for a good few minutes wondering if this was all just a stupidly vivid dream and I was about to wake up drenched in sweat. Nothing felt grounded in the realms of reality anymore. There was no light from the dim lamp post outside, nor the car I had walked past to get into the building. I couldn't even see the fucking pavement! 

There was something niggling at the back of my mind, telling me not to open that door. But that wasn't rational, none of this was. All I wanted to do was go home. Go back to a place where things felt normal. 

So against my better judgement I strode forward, hand reaching out and curling round the handle, a buzz of anticipation thrumming under my clammy palm. I yanked once, twice and then erratically until it left me breathless. 

The door wouldn't budge and the longer I stood opposite the cavernous pit of absence, gazing into the darkness the more concerned I grew that something was staring back.  Repressing a shudder I took a few steps back, breath rattling in my chest, the thump of primal fear cracking against my ribcage rhythmically. 

I was at a loss. And when my brain couldn't land on any reasonable conclusion I made the decision to run up the stairs and look through a window in the office. Perhaps someone had put a black sheet over the doorframe, maybe someone was in the building with me. Either to fuck with me for some stupid joke or maybe more sinister purposes. I didn't know. But if that was the case then I would be able to see the car park from one of the upstairs windows. 

I honestly can't put into words the feeling I got when I was met with the same sight. I remember going extremely cold, yet despite that a fevered sweat perspirated my upper brow. My heart sinking like stone into my gut. 

In a rushed panic I had fled back down the stairs, a frenzy unlike I had ever known overtaking my movements and I pulled hard on the glass door again. I even thought about trying to smash the window pane in my desperation to get out of whatever situation I had found myself in but a small and more rational part of my brain whispered soft reassurances. That I was overacting and would most definitely get sacked if I broke company property on purpose with no real justifiable excuse  other than that I was scared? Yeah…  no. 

Forcing myself to take a steadying breath I evaluated my options. This situation was weird and I was potentially in danger. The most logically explanation is that someone is fucking with me right? And potentially in a very malicious way. So upon second thought smashing the door open was not a bad idea… it would alert whoever was here to where I was but that wouldn't matter if I was quick enough. Ultimately this job wasn't worth my life. Never before had I changed my mind so quickly. 


As you can probably guess… it didn't work… 

The glass refused to shatter, the upstairs office space was now locked when I made a dash up there to hide. Worry pulling taut at my muscles at the prospect of someone hearing my failed attempts at escape. I huddled by that door for a while. Chest heaving painfully the entire time. 

Fast forward a lot of painful time spent staring at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone brandishing a knife or something akin to one to slowly encroach upon my safety. It never did happen. 

Most of the first day was spent inspecting all of the windows and exits to the building and after much internal encouragement I found myself back in the vast and mostly empty space, bar the racking, of the warehouse. I had frantically and repeatedly pushed the button to the shutter in hope of it opening it in another fruitless attempt at escape. 

 
I'm lucky that I have access to food and water. 


This was a thought that rattled around my brain as more and more hours passed me by. It turned out that the only clock in this whole place that didn't stop at 6:30 this morning is the one on the laptop i'm using to write this on. The first day of being stuck here was coming to an end and I was still no closer to understanding what was going on. 

When the weight of sleep began to pull at my eyelids a good many hours after my arrival. I was reluctant to succumb to the feeling. On edge and paranoid about my safety had me sat upright, rigid in my chair. 

I knew that I would have to sleep eventually but the thought of being in such a vulnerable state sent a painfully sharp sensation of anxiety through my veins. 

Little did I know that when the dredges of sleep finally took me, I would be waking up to a new nightmare entirely.  


It was a sound that woke me. 

The speaker I had used to keep me feeling somewhat sane must have died when I was asleep and instead of waking to the comforting lull of music I instead awoke in a blanket of darkness and a harrowing silence. I was still for a moment, head buried amongst my folded arms.  Pupils rolling in their sockets as I struggled to pull myself from the tendrils of sleep that beckoned me to stay. The first thing I noticed was how my hands ached, fingers stiff and curled inwards almost as if the moisture from my body had been sucked dry, leaving me nothing more than a shrivelled flesh sack. In an attempt to get the blood flowing into my extremities I tried to pry myself from the desk. But to my growing concern, I was unable to. It felt like there was a pressure on my neck, pushing down on the bone and pinning me there. The tiny hairs that littered my skin rising to meet a gentle exhale that danced across my flesh momentarily. It was soft, but deliberate. Almost as if someone had been standing over me. As the thought entered my sleep-addled mind my muscles seized. I bolted upright in my seat, joints popping and grinding at the sudden movement that I forced upon them. My head cracked to the side, gaze sliding across the space behind me and when my eyes landed on nothing more than emptiness my shoulders sagged at the notion that there was nothing there. 

I must have sat ramrod straight in my chair  for at least five minutes before the adrenaline began to seep from my pours, leaving me a boneless heap. With a clearer head I could reason that what I had just experienced was probably just an unfortunately timed bout of sleep paralysis. I sighed at the thought, clenching and uncleanching my fingers in an attempt to get ahold of my frayed nerves. I had experienced sleep paralysis far too regularly as a child and was unfortunately no stranger to it. Didn't make it any less stressful, especially under the circumstances I find myself currently in. There was only a slight reprieve until something new caught my attention.

I didn't register it at first. The gentle tap… tap… tapping echoing quietly from one of the aisles somewhere to the left of me. Instead I had realised in abject horror that the lights were still off  which had me jumping from my seat in panic, arms waving above my head in an attempt to trip the motion sensors.

I always did hate the dark.

To my dismay not even a flicker of light shone down from the many decrepit bulbs littering the ceiling, and when I finally ceased my flailing. Heavy breaths pushing between parted lips. I heard it again. The noise that had stirred me from a restless sleep. A noise I had believed to have come from a dream but was now making itself known in space I couldn't deny. 

There was a sickening churn of dread that twisted my insides at the thought that I could be dead. What else explains this level of fucking bat shit insane? So what, my life comes to an end one random Wednesday on my way to work? Just splat and I'm gone? Did I fall on the tracks? Get stabbed on my way in? If so why can’t I remember it and why please god why am I left here? Haunting my own workplace? What kind of fucked up joke is this? 

And how cliche is that? 

But what if I wasn't dead… What then… I'm not equipped to deal with this shit. All I wanted was a nice easy life, get my paycheck at the end of every month and rot in front of my TV. Was that too much to ask? 

Tap…. Tap…..Tap….

It was coming from the furthest reaches of the warehouse, louder this time as if purposefully trying to steal my attention away from my ever spiralling thoughts. It wasn’t mice. It was too loud, too forceful and way too slow. So now I was left posed with two options. Either ignore the creepy sound, sit back at my desk and pretend it didn't exist or walk towards whatever it was with my crappy phone torch and investigate. 

As much as I loved sitting here in my own misery, I couldn't do that forever, and ultimately I was either going to 

A) find out that I am actually dead 
or 
B) eventually die here anyway. 


So I gathered what little courage I had left floating around inside of me and pulled my phone off charge. Like I had previously stated, the warehouse itself wasn’t all that big, especially in comparison to large corporations like Amazon. I liked it on any normal day  but as I proceeded down the longest aisle of the building to reach the back end of the space it began to feel as though I was getting nowhere. The weak shine of my phone's torch only aiding in illuminating just a few feet in front of me. 

I’ve worked here a little over a year and I can tell you with utmost certainty that it takes only about two minutes to walk the length of the building at a brisk pace. Sure, I had been trepidatious to find the source of the sound so I may have been moving slower than I usually would but it was getting ridiculous. 

I pushed on even when every fibre of my being told me to stop. 

Time moved weirdly now, every movement I made felt slow and muted like wading through a thick marsh and no matter how long I walked, I never seemed to grow any closer to the back of the warehouse. In fact the space ahead of me felt distorted and elongated, thinning almost to a point in the far distance. It continued on like this for what felt like a lifetime. Each footfall bouncing off the walls adding to the pressure I could feel clutching at my skull. I began to regret my decision and when I had all but convinced myself it was no longer worth it to keep going, a green hue sputtered and buzzed to life, beams splaying out across a wall that was not there moments ago. I glanced up, eyes fixating on a fire exit sign hanging atop a freshly materialised back door. The light coming from the sign felt unnaturally bright in contrast to the rest of the room. The glow hummed in an almost nauseating way, twisting my stomach up in knots every time the electricity pulsed. 

It felt like I was being taunted. In some weird fucked up way but at least now I could see the back wall. Which meant I was surely closer to the final aisle that branched off to the right of me. 

The scratching had been a persistent cacophony that grated on my eardrums but now there was yet another noise. 

It sounded like someone was snivelling. As if they were desperately trying to hold back tears. I stopped dead in my tracks, muscles seizing in alarm at the very human sound emanating from somewhere above me. Isn't this what I had wanted? Some proof that I wasn't the only fucker left on the planet?  but in that moment I felt no relief. My skin grew clammy, a cold sweat building upon petrified skin. The grip I had on my phone tightened until I could feel the edges digging red divots in vulnerable skin and with the best will in the world I could not keep the stream of light from bouncing in trepidation as I lifted the torch higher. 

Above me was an endless tower of twisted metal. What was once an aligned and sturdy pallet rack was now looming over me, a mass of concave shelving that  folded over itself again and again, reaching impossible heights as though no ceiling existed anymore to prevent its growth as it stretched into the abyss. 

It groaned under its own weight, unstable and twitching as the crying grew louder. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My jaw swung open from the absurdity I was bearing witness to. Unsure I reached a tentative hand out, fingers dancing along the rusted metal. Its orange rot flaked off gently at my touch, dancing momentarily in the air before descending slowly onto the ground in front of me. So different from when I had last locked eyes on the shelves, how new they had looked then and how old they were now. 

Any stock that had been placed on the shelving was seemingly gone and I watched on in disbelief as the tower in front of me swayed dangerously the further my gaze wandered up and somewhere up there was a lone box, a large one that would typically be used to store large quantities of items. It was the only thing left on the racking and the longer I stared the quicker I realised that the low moans and watery breath were coming from inside of it. Whatever was in there moved slightly, its body dragging against the thin material that confined it. 

The box was too high up for even the reach truck. There was also a very real chance that the vehicle wouldn't even work in the crazy ass pocket dimension I found myself in. If I wanted to know what was up there, I was going to have to climb… 

Fuck that. 

No, I refused then and I refuse now as I sit here writing this. Climbing up that contorted pile of metal was exactly how I was going to die here if I tried and who knows what fucking monstrosity is up there?. So I ran. I had run as fast as my legs would carry me away from the sound and obtrusive mass that bent unnaturally higher and higher into what was now just a stretch of nothingness above me. This place was unravelling. Each passing hour seemed to distort different parts of the warehouse and on my mad dash back toward the only place I felt any sort of comfort, my desk, it had taken me twice as long to clear the winding pathway back. 

…and yet the wailing only grew louder. 

And my already dwindling sense of safety was slipping through my fingers yet again. 

So now here we are. 42 hours in and I have no idea what to do. The wifi keeps dipping in and out. So I don’t know if this will upload at all.

F21,"Hi there, I feel kinda stupid writing this but figured I’d give it a shot. I’m an outgoing person, love talking to people, and usually am pretty open about what I want in any sort of romantic relationship (though it’s been about a year since my last). I recently have started hanging out with this girl a lot who is unbelievably shy and quiet. I really like her, and I don’t have a problem with her being shy at all she’s lovely, brilliant, beautiful, and is comfortable enough with me to talk to me and whatnot. My issue is that I can’t envision a scenario where I’m able to voice my feelings for her in a timely manner without putting her in a position she might be uncomfortable with and subsequently I cannot read the vibe from her at all (which I’m usually alright at doing). I worry that due to her non-confrontational nature if I were to tell her I have feelings for her she might act reciprocating simply because she doesn’t know what else to do in that sort of situation and I would absolutely hate to put her in that position.

I haven’t asked her about it but I am fairly certain she has never been in another relationship, she’s very dedicated to her studies and seems to keep to herself mostly. On top of this she is incredibly difficult to read. 

The texting is weird, it usually takes a while for her to respond which I initially thought was a clear sign but she always does respond and attentively asking follow up questions and furthering the convo, I think she just isn’t glued to her phone idk. And she keeps asking me if I want to go out and do things. The first time we hung out we just got coffee, I invited her and we both had a great time just chatting. I was pretty much convinced that was gonna be it that we’d remain friends and it wouldn’t go anywhere farther but then she invited me (which was unexpected) out again to something else telling me she had a great time with me, I invited her out after that blah blah and now  here we are. With anyone else I would have attempted to make a move by now or just be upfront that I like her but I am at a genuine loss for the situation. 

We’re hanging out again soon and I just don’t want to hurt her or put her in a situation where she’s uncomfortable she’s so kind and I’d rather this not go anywhere than risk putting her in an embarrassing or uncomfortable situation especially if it’s her first experience with any sort of relationship. All of this basically boils down to is she just being kind because it’s her nature, does she just want to be friends? I know no one on here is a wizard who can tell me (wizards plz dm me) but I just needed to write this out anyway for my thoughts thank you everyone who reads/offers advice.

1oo2jal,https://www.reddit.com/r/justcreepystories/comments/1oo2jal/ive_been_locked_inside_this_warehouse_for_42/,I’ve been locked inside this warehouse for 42 hours and everyone is missing (part 1),"I don’t know if anyone will end up reading this. Fuck I don't even know if there's anyone left outside this damn building. The last time I looked out the window everything was dark, but not in the usual way one would expect the early hours of the morning to be. It was oppressive…. It was unnatural. No matter how much I strained my eyes and begged a god, that would shun me as a heretic, for mercy there was no denying the abyss that pressed against the windowpane. It was as if I was floating in the deepest reaches of a space devoid of stars and here I stood, nothing but a vacuous pit of questions.

Completely and utterly alone. 

I'm writing this solely because I don’t know what else to do. I’m Hoping someone is still out there, no… needing there to be someone out there to tell me this is some kind of fucked up joke or that maybe I’m in the midst of some kind of breakdown. Anything to help me understand. 


Let me explain from the beginning, maybe recounting the last two days will help me get a better grasp on the reality I'm facing.  The funny thing is, it started exactly the same as every other day. Same monotonous routine; wake up at 5:10 each morning, adorn my high vis and steel toe boots, catch the 6:10 train only to find myself at the locked gates of my place of work not even forty minutes after leaving my house. 

Same route, same times and even the same faces passed me by on my commute. It had been dark out, a little cold and a little damp but everything was… normal… 

I was the first to arrive at work most days which granted me access to a set of the building's keys shortly after my employment. So it wasn't unusual to be the only one squinting under the dim flicker of an overhead lamp post with the cold biting at my fingertips, as I struggled to pry the stubborn metal of the gates open as quickly as possible in hopes of finding reprieve from the winter air. I didn't even have an inkling anything was wrong until a good thirty minutes after I had arrived. 

I work in a fairly small warehouse for an independent enterprise in a small non descript town. Just your average location for any average joe. The building has a small office space above the warehouse and the day to day workload was never that intense. In fact most days were a slow slog to 3:30, but the small team of people I grew to know helped the time pass. 

Normally within ten to twenty minutes of my arrival other members of staff would start to trickle in, accompanied by the general groan of sleepiness and resentment for being stuck in what was essentially a fucking ice box all day instead of wrapped up in bed with a warm cup of coffee. 

The one shitty heater the company provided us smelt as though it was ready to catch fire at any moment and yet we would all huddle round it desperately whenever we got the chance. So even the temperature hadn't seemed strange at the time. I can feel it now though… how it's slowly creeping under my skin and nesting in my bones. 

I’m concerned about how much colder it’s going to get the longer I’m trapped here. 

After I had deactivated the alarm and made my first cup of coffee for the day I made my way toward the door, the large windows overseeing the warehouse loomed in my peripheral, which always did a great job at freaking me the fuck out. You see, the lights for the warehouse itself are automated and will only come on when it senses movement, so whenever I make my way toward the door in the mornings I refuse to look through those damn windows. Call it an overactive imagination or watching too many horror films in my spare time but I didn't like looking into a pit of darkness especially when no one else was in the building.  An irrational part of my mind would always supply that someone could be watching me on the other side of the glass. Stupid right? Now I kind of wish there was. I haven't seen a single soul in 42 hours which is fucking insane. 

This whole situation is making me feel insane. 

I remember the confusion that I had felt when no one had shown up after I had assumed a good thirty minutes had passed. I had glanced around the space for a while, pacing around the staff room and warehouse office wondering if I could see any signs of a new arrival and when I had finally begun to drive myself a little crazy doing so I fished my phone from my pocket and stared down in a detached kind of shock when my phone flashed the numbers 6:30am back at me. The time I had first arrived at work. There was no way. I had been here for at least twenty to thirty minutes. So the time staring back at me must have been wrong. Now as much as this had sent a tiny shiver of unease through my spine It wasn't unexplainable and so I didn't ponder on it much, still too perplexed as to why no one else was here yet. 

It wasn't a bank holiday, it was the middle of the week and there was no indication as to why no one else had shown up. Perhaps there had been an accident and people were stuck in traffic?. 

So I waited for roughly another thirty minutes. Idly staring at my phone screen in mild fascination. Time unchanging. It was at this point I really started to feel antsy, fingers dancing along the sides of my phone, unable to refrain from fidgeting where I sat. Maybe I should just leave? No one was answering their phones and the longer I sat there, the more on edge I had become. I felt silly for feeling so spooked at the time, telling myself that if anything it was a day off from work and that I had probably missed an email about the place being shut for the day. 

The low melody of changes by Black Sabbath danced in the otherwise still space between the walls of this place, offering a small salvation from the eerie feeling that accompanied me as I logged into my work email on the laptop at my makeshift desk, that sat in the corner of the warehouse. The red laser of the scanner hummed quietly as it projected its dim light across the white walls opposite the computer. 

There had been no email. The calls I had tried to make had gone from ringing out to not going through at all from my end. It was as if the entire place became a deadzone. No signal and no wifi connection. 

The open space that sat oppressively against my back felt almost suffocating the longer I swivelled nervously in the desk chair. Fuck this right? Something didn't feel right and the longer I stewed in that feeling the heavier it got. So with a shaky exhale I pushed myself back abruptly from the laptop and gathered my bag and headphones from under the desk. If no one was coming then what was I doing here?  I knew the address of my work friend Natalie, I could swing by and see what was going on at a more reasonable hour of the day. There must have been some kind of announcement I missed and whilst everyone else was at home I was here like a complete fucking idiot waiting around. 

There was still a part of me that hesitated at the prospect of leaving. What if I got in trouble? What if after I leave people do start to show up and then I'm the one that gets questioned about my impromptu absence? 

Well it turns out that none of that mattered because when my eyes landed on the glass door of the entrance all I could see was a thick blanket of obsidian. I stood there for a good few minutes wondering if this was all just a stupidly vivid dream and I was about to wake up drenched in sweat. Nothing felt grounded in the realms of reality anymore. There was no light from the dim lamp post outside, nor the car I had walked past to get into the building. I couldn't even see the fucking pavement! 

There was something niggling at the back of my mind, telling me not to open that door. But that wasn't rational, none of this was. All I wanted to do was go home. Go back to a place where things felt normal. 

So against my better judgement I strode forward, hand reaching out and curling round the handle, a buzz of anticipation thrumming under my clammy palm. I yanked once, twice and then erratically until it left me breathless. 

The door wouldn't budge and the longer I stood opposite the cavernous pit of absence, gazing into the darkness the more concerned I grew that something was staring back.  Repressing a shudder I took a few steps back, breath rattling in my chest, the thump of primal fear cracking against my ribcage rhythmically. 

I was at a loss. And when my brain couldn't land on any reasonable conclusion I made the decision to run up the stairs and look through a window in the office. Perhaps someone had put a black sheet over the doorframe, maybe someone was in the building with me. Either to fuck with me for some stupid joke or maybe more sinister purposes. I didn't know. But if that was the case then I would be able to see the car park from one of the upstairs windows. 

I honestly can't put into words the feeling I got when I was met with the same sight. I remember going extremely cold, yet despite that a fevered sweat perspirated my upper brow. My heart sinking like stone into my gut. 

In a rushed panic I had fled back down the stairs, a frenzy unlike I had ever known overtaking my movements and I pulled hard on the glass door again. I even thought about trying to smash the window pane in my desperation to get out of whatever situation I had found myself in but a small and more rational part of my brain whispered soft reassurances. That I was overacting and would most definitely get sacked if I broke company property on purpose with no real justifiable excuse  other than that I was scared? Yeah…  no. 

Forcing myself to take a steadying breath I evaluated my options. This situation was weird and I was potentially in danger. The most logically explanation is that someone is fucking with me right? And potentially in a very malicious way. So upon second thought smashing the door open was not a bad idea… it would alert whoever was here to where I was but that wouldn't matter if I was quick enough. Ultimately this job wasn't worth my life. Never before had I changed my mind so quickly. 


As you can probably guess… it didn't work… 

The glass refused to shatter, the upstairs office space was now locked when I made a dash up there to hide. Worry pulling taut at my muscles at the prospect of someone hearing my failed attempts at escape. I huddled by that door for a while. Chest heaving painfully the entire time. 

Fast forward a lot of painful time spent staring at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone brandishing a knife or something akin to one to slowly encroach upon my safety. It never did happen. 

Most of the first day was spent inspecting all of the windows and exits to the building and after much internal encouragement I found myself back in the vast and mostly empty space, bar the racking, of the warehouse. I had frantically and repeatedly pushed the button to the shutter in hope of it opening it in another fruitless attempt at escape. 

 
I'm lucky that I have access to food and water. 


This was a thought that rattled around my brain as more and more hours passed me by. It turned out that the only clock in this whole place that didn't stop at 6:30 this morning is the one on the laptop i'm using to write this on. The first day of being stuck here was coming to an end and I was still no closer to understanding what was going on. 

When the weight of sleep began to pull at my eyelids a good many hours after my arrival. I was reluctant to succumb to the feeling. On edge and paranoid about my safety had me sat upright, rigid in my chair. 

I knew that I would have to sleep eventually but the thought of being in such a vulnerable state sent a painfully sharp sensation of anxiety through my veins. 

Little did I know that when the dredges of sleep finally took me, I would be waking up to a new nightmare entirely.  


It was a sound that woke me. 

The speaker I had used to keep me feeling somewhat sane must have died when I was asleep and instead of waking to the comforting lull of music I instead awoke in a blanket of darkness and a harrowing silence. I was still for a moment, head buried amongst my folded arms.  Pupils rolling in their sockets as I struggled to pull myself from the tendrils of sleep that beckoned me to stay. The first thing I noticed was how my hands ached, fingers stiff and curled inwards almost as if the moisture from my body had been sucked dry, leaving me nothing more than a shrivelled flesh sack. In an attempt to get the blood flowing into my extremities I tried to pry myself from the desk. But to my growing concern, I was unable to. It felt like there was a pressure on my neck, pushing down on the bone and pinning me there. The tiny hairs that littered my skin rising to meet a gentle exhale that danced across my flesh momentarily. It was soft, but deliberate. Almost as if someone had been standing over me. As the thought entered my sleep-addled mind my muscles seized. I bolted upright in my seat, joints popping and grinding at the sudden movement that I forced upon them. My head cracked to the side, gaze sliding across the space behind me and when my eyes landed on nothing more than emptiness my shoulders sagged at the notion that there was nothing there. 

I must have sat ramrod straight in my chair  for at least five minutes before the adrenaline began to seep from my pours, leaving me a boneless heap. With a clearer head I could reason that what I had just experienced was probably just an unfortunately timed bout of sleep paralysis. I sighed at the thought, clenching and uncleanching my fingers in an attempt to get ahold of my frayed nerves. I had experienced sleep paralysis far too regularly as a child and was unfortunately no stranger to it. Didn't make it any less stressful, especially under the circumstances I find myself currently in. There was only a slight reprieve until something new caught my attention.

I didn't register it at first. The gentle tap… tap… tapping echoing quietly from one of the aisles somewhere to the left of me. Instead I had realised in abject horror that the lights were still off  which had me jumping from my seat in panic, arms waving above my head in an attempt to trip the motion sensors.

I always did hate the dark.

To my dismay not even a flicker of light shone down from the many decrepit bulbs littering the ceiling, and when I finally ceased my flailing. Heavy breaths pushing between parted lips. I heard it again. The noise that had stirred me from a restless sleep. A noise I had believed to have come from a dream but was now making itself known in space I couldn't deny. 

There was a sickening churn of dread that twisted my insides at the thought that I could be dead. What else explains this level of fucking bat shit insane? So what, my life comes to an end one random Wednesday on my way to work? Just splat and I'm gone? Did I fall on the tracks? Get stabbed on my way in? If so why can’t I remember it and why please god why am I left here? Haunting my own workplace? What kind of fucked up joke is this? 

And how cliche is that? 

But what if I wasn't dead… What then… I'm not equipped to deal with this shit. All I wanted was a nice easy life, get my paycheck at the end of every month and rot in front of my TV. Was that too much to ask? 

Tap…. Tap…..Tap….

It was coming from the furthest reaches of the warehouse, louder this time as if purposefully trying to steal my attention away from my ever spiralling thoughts. It wasn’t mice. It was too loud, too forceful and way too slow. So now I was left posed with two options. Either ignore the creepy sound, sit back at my desk and pretend it didn't exist or walk towards whatever it was with my crappy phone torch and investigate. 

As much as I loved sitting here in my own misery, I couldn't do that forever, and ultimately I was either going to 

A) find out that I am actually dead 
or 
B) eventually die here anyway. 


So I gathered what little courage I had left floating around inside of me and pulled my phone off charge. Like I had previously stated, the warehouse itself wasn’t all that big, especially in comparison to large corporations like Amazon. I liked it on any normal day  but as I proceeded down the longest aisle of the building to reach the back end of the space it began to feel as though I was getting nowhere. The weak shine of my phone's torch only aiding in illuminating just a few feet in front of me. 

I’ve worked here a little over a year and I can tell you with utmost certainty that it takes only about two minutes to walk the length of the building at a brisk pace. Sure, I had been trepidatious to find the source of the sound so I may have been moving slower than I usually would but it was getting ridiculous. 

I pushed on even when every fibre of my being told me to stop. 

Time moved weirdly now, every movement I made felt slow and muted like wading through a thick marsh and no matter how long I walked, I never seemed to grow any closer to the back of the warehouse. In fact the space ahead of me felt distorted and elongated, thinning almost to a point in the far distance. It continued on like this for what felt like a lifetime. Each footfall bouncing off the walls adding to the pressure I could feel clutching at my skull. I began to regret my decision and when I had all but convinced myself it was no longer worth it to keep going, a green hue sputtered and buzzed to life, beams splaying out across a wall that was not there moments ago. I glanced up, eyes fixating on a fire exit sign hanging atop a freshly materialised back door. The light coming from the sign felt unnaturally bright in contrast to the rest of the room. The glow hummed in an almost nauseating way, twisting my stomach up in knots every time the electricity pulsed. 

It felt like I was being taunted. In some weird fucked up way but at least now I could see the back wall. Which meant I was surely closer to the final aisle that branched off to the right of me. 

The scratching had been a persistent cacophony that grated on my eardrums but now there was yet another noise. 

It sounded like someone was snivelling. As if they were desperately trying to hold back tears. I stopped dead in my tracks, muscles seizing in alarm at the very human sound emanating from somewhere above me. Isn't this what I had wanted? Some proof that I wasn't the only fucker left on the planet?  but in that moment I felt no relief. My skin grew clammy, a cold sweat building upon petrified skin. The grip I had on my phone tightened until I could feel the edges digging red divots in vulnerable skin and with the best will in the world I could not keep the stream of light from bouncing in trepidation as I lifted the torch higher. 

Above me was an endless tower of twisted metal. What was once an aligned and sturdy pallet rack was now looming over me, a mass of concave shelving that  folded over itself again and again, reaching impossible heights as though no ceiling existed anymore to prevent its growth as it stretched into the abyss. 

It groaned under its own weight, unstable and twitching as the crying grew louder. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My jaw swung open from the absurdity I was bearing witness to. Unsure I reached a tentative hand out, fingers dancing along the rusted metal. Its orange rot flaked off gently at my touch, dancing momentarily in the air before descending slowly onto the ground in front of me. So different from when I had last locked eyes on the shelves, how new they had looked then and how old they were now. 

Any stock that had been placed on the shelving was seemingly gone and I watched on in disbelief as the tower in front of me swayed dangerously the further my gaze wandered up and somewhere up there was a lone box, a large one that would typically be used to store large quantities of items. It was the only thing left on the racking and the longer I stared the quicker I realised that the low moans and watery breath were coming from inside of it. Whatever was in there moved slightly, its body dragging against the thin material that confined it. 

The box was too high up for even the reach truck. There was also a very real chance that the vehicle wouldn't even work in the crazy ass pocket dimension I found myself in. If I wanted to know what was up there, I was going to have to climb… 

Fuck that. 

No, I refused then and I refuse now as I sit here writing this. Climbing up that contorted pile of metal was exactly how I was going to die here if I tried and who knows what fucking monstrosity is up there?. So I ran. I had run as fast as my legs would carry me away from the sound and obtrusive mass that bent unnaturally higher and higher into what was now just a stretch of nothingness above me. This place was unravelling. Each passing hour seemed to distort different parts of the warehouse and on my mad dash back toward the only place I felt any sort of comfort, my desk, it had taken me twice as long to clear the winding pathway back. 

…and yet the wailing only grew louder. 

And my already dwindling sense of safety was slipping through my fingers yet again. 

So now here we are. 42 hours in and I have no idea what to do. The wifi keeps dipping in and out. So I don’t know if this will upload at all.

I have a small tv den (10 ft x 10 ft) that doubles as our guest room (the couch pulls out to a bed). I need to make the most of the space as it’s a multi-functional room. I wanted to create a moody, comfy vibe (see Pinterest photos for my inspo), but right now it’s feeling very meh.

I plan to mount the tv, but because we pull the bed out often I probably wouldn’t put a coffee table in the middle. 

My questions:

- I’ll definitely paint the walls so it’s not so stark white (photo samples on the wall), the trim on the window will stay grey. Is it ok to leave the ceiling white and paint up to the trim?

- What other furniture should I add? I was thinking one of the shelving units in the photos, but I’m worried about crowding the room/taking up too much floor space since the room is quite cramped. Maybe mounted shelving is better? 

- How else can I elevate the room? I can switch out the art for something else (right now I think it’s not working). 

Open to any and all suggestions, the only furniture I want to keep for sure is the couch and rug. Everything else can change! ",1,1762246450.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

*   **Classic Timepiece**: You don't need to break the bank. A stylish, minimalist watch from a brand like Seiko, Tissot, or even a smart-looking Casio can elevate his entire look.
*   **Bamboo or Silk Pajama Set**: Upgrade his loungewear. A comfortable, stylish set of pajamas is a luxury he might not buy for himself but will absolutely appreciate.
*   **Premium Grooming Kit**: Think beyond Old Spice. A kit with quality products like sandalwood shave cream, a cedarwood-scented beard oil, or a sturdy safety razor feels like a sophisticated and personal gift.

Sometimes the best present isn't a *thing*, but a memory you create together.

*   **Tickets to a Game or Concert**: Does he have a favorite team or band? Snag two tickets to an upcoming event. It gives him something to look forward to and the promise of a great day or night out.
*   **A Class or Workshop**: Sign him up for something he's always wanted to learn. Think a cocktail-making class, a woodworking workshop, a pottery lesson, or even race car driving.
*   **Weekend Getaway**: Plan a surprise trip to a nearby city, a cozy cabin in the woods, or a bed & breakfast in a wine region. The planning is half the gift!
*   **An Adventure Pass**: Get him an annual pass to a national park, a state park system, or even a local attraction like a botanical garden or museum. It's the gift that encourages fun all year long.

Was afraid before I begun reading about all side-effects so thought I'd share something different here. Took the first shoot after dinner, the first morning after I already noticed that the ""food noise"" was suppressed. I also really didn't want coffee after the first cup in the morning and this is from a swede drinking 6-8 cups a day. Started drinking a lot more water, taking my time to chew my food (instead of ""inhaling"" my food as I used to do :D ) and stopped my late-night snacking. It was wonderful being able to go to bed without feeling that hunger pit in my stomach I used to have if I tried to skip the late-night snacking. Also started taking probiotics and multivitamins. Besides having a bit more gas (burping) and a low-key head-ache for a couple of days (but I do believe that might have been from removing so much caffeine) I've not had any side-effects at all. So beginning to feel hopeful that this will work!

1oo23ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blacklibrary/comments/1oo23ax/some_thoughts_on_warhammer_crime_bloodlines/,Some thoughts on Warhammer Crime: Bloodlines,"As it was one of the first books I bought after gathering intel on what the Black Library has to offer, I would like to share some thoughts on the Warhammer Crime novel Bloodlines after finishing it yesterday evening.

The novel seems to have gathered universal praise in the posts and reviews I had a look at, as it was something new and interesting, and on a different scale than the grand destinies of the astartes. Just normal everyday life in a hive city and a cop trying to make a difference.

I think it delivered on this, mostly. It felt like reading a cyberpunk story but with a distinct imperium of man-feeling to it.

I am pretty new to reading Warhammer 40K (but not to reading fiction in my 40+ years of living), im only four books into Heresy and ive finished the Eisenhorn and Night Lord omnibuses. But that was enough I think to give me a feeling of stepping it down a few notches from intergalactic plots to just (kinda) local.

I think the book struggles with length and the author isnt very economical with what he focuses on. I would not have minded another 200 pages to give it some space to breathe.

The characters, except Zidarov, feel sort of flat and are only given a few moments to grow or develop any relationships or psychological depth.

It feels like the author focuses more on heavily descriptive passages of how dark and dreary and wet the city is, overly trying to establish a cyberpunk noir feeling in a way that really isnt necessary. When im 240 pages into a 300 page book I dont need quarter of a page describing another grimdark skyline of space haulers docking or towers with aquilas. I wish more words were given Zidarov, Milija, Naxi and his colleagues.

It also struck me that their living standards and life routines revolved heavily around recognizable earthly practices like our own lives. Drinking coffee (caffeine) and living in an apartment, eating food from street vendors and being tired at work. I liked that alot even if it sometimes felt too familiar? I had thought that life 40.000 years from now would be more alien and strange to us, but maybe humans will always be doing human things. It taught me something about the universe. Or rather had me asking questions to myself about the setting that I think are interesting.

The religious things it suddenly delved into was very interesting and I wish it could take up more space in connection to what I said above. It made me want to know more, have more world building about local planetary religious beliefs and how they interconnect with the imperial faith.

The plot is good, I think it was kind of refreshing how there isnt alot of violence and the story plods on and pulls at leads into a mystery much like how an investigator works as well. That felt very connected, the writing and the work of the main protagonist. The climax being a short car chase and a crash is a little weird and unceremonious, I had thought there would be more of a showndown. But after giving it some thought I sort of like it, that its not perfect but gets the job done, kind of like how life often is, and how the book in general felt.

Im not crazy about the book and I think words like amazing that ive seen other people use is a bit too much for me. But I did enjoy it and it kept me turning pages. I think ill try to acquire all of the crime novels, its an interesting break from ”bolter porn” even if I think that word is kind of a slur, we all know we like space marines shooting things to hell.

But the main takeaway is that id happily get more into reading about everyday life of imperial citizens. And thats what the book did well.

If so, why you returned and why you quitted again?","So as the question says in the title - have you quitted drinking coffee at some point, then later returned back for coffee drinking and then later again go back to life without it?

If so, why you returned in the first place?

Why you wanted to go again without the coffee?

Personally I am again quitting. Now is the first day without any caffeine, yesterday morning I drank only very little amount of caffeine. I made morning coffee from decaf and added 1,5 amounts of normal coffee because I had a headache and muscle pain.

Reason why I quitted earlier this year for 3 months was to take a look if that was causing my sleeping issues. It turned out that it didn't helped me and in many nights I slept even worse.

I noticed good things without caffeine, but I didn't felt benefits were good enough for me to be without coffee so I continued to drink coffee. Originally the motivation was only to see if I will start to get sleep without coffee better, and since I didn't, I returned back to caffeine.

Now I have been drinking couple of months again coffee, but now when the autumn is here I have noticed incredible tiredness even on days when I have slept very well. I have slept 7,5 hours or so, but still felt tired and had to take almost two hours or so sleep after the work.

Then it came to my mind, that hmm, when I was not drinking coffee at all, I did not had this kind of insanely tired days or at least I can't remember any so I thought that I might go again back to life without caffeine because my energy levels were so much more stable without it. Also when yesterday morning I got that small headache and had to add small amount of normal coffee to decaf, I thought that it is not worth it - my body is the temple for Holy Spirit and I do not want to be addicted to any substance (or ""addicted"" as in whatever causes issues for body without it, like headaches or so).

Maybe this time I will quit the coffee, because the reason is different. No matter if I sleep badly still or not, but if I feel this kind of crashes of energy through the days with coffee, it is not worth it.

What about you?

**The Verdict:**  
Manchester City is a **72.5% favorite** to humiliate Borussia Dortmund at home, per FanDuel’s 1.38 odds. Dortmund’s 14.3% implied probability of winning is about as likely as a snowstorm in the Sahara. The draw? A 18.5% shot—roughly the chance I’ll stop comparing Dortmund’s attack to a deflated balloon.

**Why City’s Winning Like It’s 2022 All Over Again:**

* **Erling Haaland** is the star, naturally. His anytime goal prop is a **-200 favorite** (66.7% implied probability). He’s scored in 8 of his last 10 CL games here. Bet on him like you trust your morning coffee to wake you up.
* **Phil Foden** (-115 for assists over 0.5) and **Jeremy Doku** (-115 for shots over 3.5) are the supporting cast. Foden’s creativity and Doku’s darting runs make them must-watch props.
* The **total goals over 3.25** is priced at 1.87 (54% implied). With Haaland and Dortmund
