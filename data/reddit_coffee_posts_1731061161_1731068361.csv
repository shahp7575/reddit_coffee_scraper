I know a bit about computers but still a bit of a noob when it comes to a few things, 

Problem I'm having is I'm trying to install an AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GB GDDDR4 but for some reason I cannot install the drivers even after uninstalling all the old ones, it crashing on the AMD Adrenalin edition, 

For now I've managed to install the old GPUs back into it so I can game for now, as they will run some older games really well, and a few newer games on lowest settings, but now I've got the problem of some games will load up fine, but the a few minuits onto gameplay will turn me off back to the desktop 

Few things I'm worried about is my idiot brother in law had it for a while and he knows nothing about pcs not even how to look after one, he spilt coffee on it and candle wax due to obviously sticking a candle on it without anything under the candle, (yeah he's literally really dumb it's not an over exaggeration) so could some of the components be damaged as that's My first guess but despite this it does run quite well

(English isn’t my first language, so apologies in advance.)

Here’s a bit of backstory. Back in June, Jenny asked about my summer plans, hoping we could spend some time together. I told her I didn’t have any time off in the summer, but I was planning a trip to Seoul later in the year and invited her to come along. She was in—and later, she also invited Nancy. I’d only met Nancy once, but she seemed nice, so I was excited about the idea of a “girls’ trip.”

Once we landed in Seoul, though, things felt off. I quickly realized I was more of a “side character.” Jenny and Nancy barely included me in conversations, often talking over me or ignoring my questions. I tried to engage and even show them around, since I’d been there before, but I still felt invisible. I’d booked us a DMZ tour, and even there, it felt like I was alone while they chatted together.

Small things kept adding up, and it hurt me a lot and made me feel really sad, like I’d somehow invited myself on their trip. They’d leave the hotel without me, wander off in stores without a word, and once they even skipped an appointment I’d made for us to get lash lifts. I waited there alone, only to find out they’d made other plans.

Eventually, I started distancing myself. I stayed quiet, skipped a day trip they planned, and made my own plans with other people. If they were going to ignore me, I didn’t see the point in tagging along.

On the last day, they arranged a taxi to the airport for just the two of them. They said I could join if I wanted, but I declined. That morning, they left to get coffee without a word to me. I thought that was odd, so I took my bags and left for the airport alone, without saying goodbye. Since we were on different flights, it felt like the right choice.

Now, I’m on the plane wondering if I was wrong. Jenny unfollowed me on social media, and I’m unsure if it’s because I left without a goodbye or if something deeper was wrong. I’ve known her for almost six years, and we’ve never had issues before. Part of me feels justified because of how they treated me, but I still can’t shake the guilt. I’d been looking forward to this trip for so long, and it turned out to be such a disappointment.

Here’s what actually works:

# The ""Energy Curve"" Pattern:

* ❌ Maintaining the same energy throughout
* ✅ Dynamic energy shifts: Start at 80%, dip to 60%, then peak at 90% *(This pattern increased retention by 47%)*

# Pause Psychology:

* **Micro-pauses** (0.5s) before key points: Increased engagement by **32%**
* **Strategic silence** after shocking statements: Doubled comment rates
* **""Breathing room""** every 5 seconds: Prevented viewer fatigue

# Speed Sweet Spots:

* 🎯 First 2 seconds**:** 150-160 words/minute
* 🎯 Middle section: 130-140 words/minute
* 🎯 Call to action: 120 words/minute *(These specific speeds consistently outperformed other patterns)*

# Game-Changing Discoveries:

* **Voice inflection up**: +28% better retention
* **Lower pitch for important points**: +41% more saves
* **""Coffee shop voice""** outperforms **""YouTube voice""** by 35%

# BIGGEST INSIGHT:

Viewers stay **2.3x longer** when voice delivery matches **natural conversation patterns** rather than a ""perfect"" broadcast style.

**Pro Tip:** Record yourself in a normal conversation with friends, then mimic that energy in your Shorts. It sounds counter-intuitive, but it consistently works.

1gmgqcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1gmgqcb/i_dont_know_if_my_sleep_issues_warrants_seeing_a/,I don't know if my sleep issues warrants seeing a sleep therapist,"Hi, I'm sorry in advance for the babbling I shall do here, but I am still unsure what to do and I would appreciate your advice.

Just to lay the background, from since I remember, I never slept well. It was the same in my teens, as well as my adulthood now. I nearly always woke up feeling groggy. Of course I did get good sleep from time to time, so does not sound completely absurd to me, when people tell me they slept well, but it's rare for me. My chronotype is definitely ill-adjusted to normal working hours. When I have a couple free days with no plans, I naturally switch to going to sleep late (1AM-3AM), and waking up late. I usually sleep around 6 hours, sometimes 5:30, sometimes 7. I sleep somehow more on the weekend, but not like 10 hours either.

What troubles me is that this is not healthy to maintain for my whole life. I thought that the stress caused by combining day studies with full-time work, as well as not getting enough physical activity, were the main reasons. But now I have a low-stress job. I've finished my studies. I'm going to the gym or climbing, or just overall moving around. So technically, those factors have objectively improved, and yet I'm sleeping worse than ever. My blood work 2 years ago was perfectly fine, and yet I had sleep issues. To be fair, I did not have it done recently.

Interestingly, I usually sleep the worst in my ""own"" places (my apartment, my room in my family home), and sleep the best in random places, like hotels, friend's couches etc. The best sleep I have had in last couple years happened during my holiday, when due to the lack of AC and high heat in the place we rented, I slept on outside a freaking deckchair on the terrace for 10 nights...

My sleep does not seem to be impacted by exercise (unless it's very intense cardio).

The problem which caused me to look back and reevaluate my sleeping patterns throughout my life is that since a couple weeks, I've been getting extremely vivid dreams. I used to have big troubles falling asleep, still do, but sleep like a log and wake up only in the morning (albeit very groggy). Nowadays, I wake up crying or scared from emotional overload, depending on the nature of the dream. I fall asleep later, but I need some time after this occurs. This sometimes happens multiple times a night. I always had troubles getting out of bed, but now I had to combine my alarm clock with a QR code, purely to force myself to get out of bed. Otherwise I will oversleep.

So now this whole rant begs the question - why am I unsure whether having it checked is worth it? It is solely because despite my sleep problems, I function relatively well. I drink either none or one coffee a day (and don't feel the need to drink more), I work a desk job, and I don't fall asleep during the day. I hate naps. And yet I feel like this bad sleep quality might affect my health and well-being in ways I don't yet see, and that my body might've adapted to insufficient quality of sleep.

Do you think such issues, which seem relatively mild compared to many others in the sub, warrant seeing some specialist? If yes, who would that be, would a sleep disorder therapist be the right first choice? If not, do you have any tips? Did any of you have similar issues and know what to do?

1gmgoby,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalNomadTurkiye/comments/1gmgoby/dos_and_donts_in_türkiye/,Do’s and Don’ts in Türkiye 🇹🇷,"I had a lot of fun preparing this post, and I hope it will be useful for you :) 



**✅ Do: Greet People with a Smile and a Warm “Merhaba” (Hello)**

* A friendly “Merhaba” goes a long way and is appreciated in almost any setting, from stores to social gatherings.
* In more formal settings, you might hear “Günaydın” (Good morning) or “İyi akşamlar” (Good evening). Use these greetings to show respect for formality.

Tip: It’s common to kiss on both cheeks or give a slight nod when greeting friends or family, but if you’re unsure, a handshake works too.



**🚫 Don’t: Be Too Direct or Blunt in Conversations**

* Turkish people are generally polite and prefer indirect communication in certain situations. Being too blunt or direct can sometimes come across as rude.
* If you need to decline an invitation or refuse an offer, it’s polite to soften your response. Saying “Biraz düşüneceğim” (I’ll think about it) is a good way to politely decline without causing offense.

Tip: Avoid discussing sensitive topics like politics and religion unless you know the person well and are confident they’re comfortable with it.



**✅ Do: Remove Your Shoes Before Entering a Home**

* It’s customary to remove your shoes when entering someone’s home, and many places will provide indoor slippers for guests.
* Removing your shoes is seen as a sign of respect, and it keeps the home clean.

Tip: When visiting a mosque, you’ll also be required to remove your shoes, so remember to wear socks if you’re concerned about comfort.



**🚫 Don’t: Ignore the Importance of Hospitality**

* Hospitality is a core part of Turkish culture, and you may often be offered tea, coffee, or food as a gesture of welcome.
* Refusing an offer can sometimes be seen as impolite, so even if you don’t want much, accepting a small cup of tea (çay) is a respectful gesture.

Tip: If you’re invited to someone’s home, bringing a small gift (like sweets or flowers) is a nice way to show appreciation for their hospitality.



**✅ Do: Respect Religious Customs**

* Türkiye is a secular country, but it has a strong Islamic cultural influence. During the call to prayer (ezan), which happens five times a day, it’s appreciated if you keep conversations at a lower volume if you’re near a mosque.
* During Ramadan (Ramazan), many people fast, so it’s courteous to be discreet when eating or drinking in public during daylight hours.

Tip: Visiting a mosque? Dress modestly, with covered shoulders and knees. Women may need to cover their hair, and everyone should maintain a respectful tone and volume inside.



**🚫 Don’t: Engage in Public Displays of Affection**

* In larger cities like İstanbul, minor public displays of affection may be accepted, but in smaller towns and more traditional areas, it’s best to be discreet.
* Holding hands or a light hug is fine in most places, but anything more can be seen as inappropriate, especially in conservative areas.

Tip: When in doubt, observe local behaviors and follow accordingly. In Türkiye, showing restraint in public spaces is often seen as respectful.



**✅ Do: Try to Use Basic Turkish Phrases**

* Making an effort with even a few Turkish words can create a positive impression and show respect. Basic phrases like “Teşekkür ederim” (Thank you) and “Lütfen” (Please) are always appreciated.
* Even if you’re not fluent, a simple “İyi günler” (Have a nice day) can go a long way in making a good impression.

Tip: If you’re struggling with Turkish, locals often appreciate your effort and are usually patient, especially in tourist-friendly areas.



**🚫 Don’t: Be Offended by Close Proximity in Social Settings**

* Türkiye has a more communal approach to personal space, so it’s common for people to stand or sit closer than you might be used to.
* In busy settings like markets or public transport, close proximity is normal. Try not to take it personally and go with the flow.

Tip: In social gatherings, it’s common for people to offer to share food, drinks, or even a small space at their table. Accepting the offer can often lead to friendly interactions!



**✅ Do: Show Respect to Elders**

* Elders hold a special place in Turkish culture, and respecting them is essential. Greeting older individuals first, offering your seat to them on public transport, or addressing them with “Bey” (Mr.) or “Hanım” (Mrs.) shows respect.
* When interacting with elders, a polite and formal approach is always appreciated.

Tip: Offering a hand to help or allowing elders to go ahead in line are small gestures that show respect and are highly valued in Turkish culture.

According to a [study by HBR](https://hbr.org/2014/04/help-your-employees-find-flow), on average, a person faces 87 interruptions per day. Out of those, 22 are external, and 65 are self-imposed (YouTube, WhatsApp, coffee breaks, etc.).

The problem? After each interruption, it takes an average of 23 minutes to get back into a flow state.

Now, if we cross this data with an interesting study from GitHub, we’ll see that the famous “Developer Flow” has a massive impact on productivity.

Developers who can maintain a solid flow throughout the day report a 50% increase in productivity compared to those who can’t focus for extended periods. It’s worth noting that these numbers come from the developers’ own perceptions.

So, we know more flow time = more productivity. But how can we make that happen?

According to GitHub’s study, some strategies to increase flow time include:

\- **Creating specific spaces and times for deep work:** Encourage blocks of uninterrupted time, like designated periods for focused work. (Paul Graham has a great article on this called Maker’s Schedule).  

**- Minimizing interruptions:** Environments that promote concentration and team practices that respect each other’s focus time are essential.

\- **Automation and intuitive tools:** Automating repetitive tasks and using tools that simplify work can reduce cognitive load and prevent unnecessary distractions, allowing developers to focus on what truly matters.

Reposting for visibility - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 2 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am just looking for a connection - be it only friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but the latter is not going so well as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within day-trip distances.

Minutes take hours and hours take years. There are only so many times a person can fill the sour cream and guacamole guns in one go without wanting to put them to your temple and pull the trigger. Would it kill you? No. Would it make a mess? Absolutely, and what a godsend that would be.

It would give you something to do.

Más Tacos was in the “Bentwater Corners,” a small suburban strip mall with little to no foot traffic. Every store here was the generic version of something more successful. Like a copy, it never looked as good as the original. I told friends Bentwater Corners was the island of misfit toys. It surprised me we stayed in business at all.

We were located between Burgers Ahoy, another also-ran chain restaurant, and the confusing Bank of Chester. I don’t know if someone named the bank after a founder or a city named Chester and it was never explained to me. In the five months I worked at the taco shack, I’d never seen a person enter or exit the bank. Hell, I’d never even seen anyone use the ATM.

Not even to pull out drug money.

My school schedule forces me to work late nights. I’m there from six in the evening until around midnight or a little after, depending on how much cleaning we have to do. Often, I’m in my car by 12:01. Like I said, we’re never busy.

After our “dinner rush” of about six to fifteen people, we have nothing but time to kill. We clean and prep and, once that’s done, we double and triple check our work. If we still have time, the entire shift takes turns fucking around on their phone while keeping an eye out for Mary, our manager.

I didn’t mind Mary. After years of being a stay-at-home mom, her divorce suddenly threw her back into the workforce. Sometimes she acted a bit harried and cracked the whip, but she was also understanding. Mary wasn’t the ogre some of my fellow co-workers made her out to be. She was the boss and had to do boss things occasionally. Those actions often flew in the face of people trying to do as little as possible and still stay gainfully employed.

Most nights, I worked with the same crew of miscreants. They were an eclectic bunch, but we all got along. It’s like soldiers in the army. You’re thrown into a foxhole with whoever and end up bonding over your shared trauma. Most nights, it was me, an aspiring rapper named Doug (aka Tha Dougfather), Jenna, a social media influencer in training, and a rotating cast of new hires. This night, the new guy was a pale, goth guy named Reggie. If you ask me, Reggie isn’t exactly a goth sounding name, but who am I to judge?

Tonight, while we were going about our normal “dodge Mary” routine, I heard Mary let loose a string of curse words from her little office that’d make a sailor blush. I took this as a cue to put my phone away and pick up a mop. As I was wringing out, a frazzled Mary came rushing up to me. Her face was panic-stricken and slightly pale. Something was wrong.

“Jill, my asshole ex just called. He was letting Jeremy play ‘Superman’ at home…”

“Superman?”

She sighed. I could tell this had been a point of contention before. “The asshole ex lets him jump off the top bunk into a pile of pillows. Anyway, Jeremy landed on his arm funny, and the asshole ex thinks he may have broken it. They’re off to urgent care right now. I have to meet them there.”

“Of course,” I said. “Should we close up or….”

“I can’t close early. Mr. Adamyan would kill me if he found out we did.” She sighed. “Can I trust you to close up the shop tonight? I can give you the alarm codes and keys.”

Her face was pleading as intensely as her words. I saw the worried mom look in her eyes and my heart softened. “Of course. Go be with your kid.”

“Oh my God, thank you! I owe you, big!”

“It’s family stuff, no worries.”

She gave me a quick hug and whispered, “I can’t trust anyone else. You’re the only one here going places, present company included.”

“Not true,” I said, smiling. “You’re going to be with your baby.”

She gave me a friendly smile. “Thank you. You’re a hero.”

She ran back to her office to gather her things. As soon as she was out of sight, Doug sidled up to me. He nodded toward Mary’s office. “What did ‘Live, Laugh, Love’ want with you?”

I grinned. “She put me in charge for the night.”

Doug laughed. “Fuck, dog. This whole place is going to go up in flames then.”

“Shut up,” I said, punching his arm.

“How come she picked you? She should’ve picked me,” he said, frowning.

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. Doug feigned offense. “Shit, if I ran this place, I’d have us going toe-to-toe with Taco Bell in two weeks. People be beating down the doors to get our Sopa de Awesomes and Sombrero taco boxes.”

“Uh huh.”

“And once I launched our new mascot, Mr. Taco, shiiiiit. We’re rolling in dough.”

“Or tortillas, as it were,” before adding, “and Mr. Taco? That’s the best name you got?”

“Gotta keep the names simple for Americans. We’re simple people. Check this, though. Mr. Taco would have a huge sombero and those bullet things across his chest. But instead of bullets…they’d be little tacos. Pretty slick, right?”

“The Taco guy would have smaller tacos as decorations? In a world of living, breathing tacos, wouldn’t those little tacos be baby tacos? Kinda fucked up, Doug.”

“Jill’s right, the name needs work,” Jenna said, joining us by the nacho station. “I know branding and Mr. Taco doesn’t cut it. When I started my GRWM videos, I started calling them ‘Watch a bitch glow up’ to stand out. I gained two hundred followers overnight.”

“’Cause you were showing off the curves, Jenna. You got it easy.”

Jenna laughed, “Easy? You try coming up with compelling daily content to satisfy thousands of parasocial stans. Boobs and ass can only take you so far.”

“To that end, maybe Mr. Taco needs a lady friend? Senorita Carnitas?”

“Ooh, I like that,” Jenna said. “Name is better, too.”

Doug waved us off. “Maaan, y’all overthink things. Mr. Taco don’t need a lady. He’s too wild to be tamed. He’s got that iconic Ronald McDonald energy, for real. Kids would be taking photos and shit with him. Drawing pictures. I’d probably win awards for creating him.”

“Let’s get a normies view on this,” Jenna said. “Hey Reggie, what do you think of Mr. Taco?”

The quiet guy just shrugged his shoulders. Doug nodded, “See! He knows it’s fire. Good shit, Reg! And y’all ain’t even heard about Taco Land yet. It’s full of kick-ass characters!”

Before I could further explore the origins of Taco Land (is that where Chester is located?), Mary came back into the kitchen with her purse on her shoulder and keys clutched in her hands. She called everyone over and sighed. “Look, my kid hurt himself and I have to go. Jill is in charge while I’m gone. What she says, goes. If she tells me you guys made her life hell, so help me god, I will have you cleaning the grease traps for a week. Am I clear?”

Everyone nodded. Mary turned to me and placed her hand on my shoulder. “If you need anything - anything - don’t hesitate to call or text, okay?”

“Got ya.”

“Thanks again.”

“No worries, go see Jeremy. I know he needs his mom.”

Mary gave me a kind nod before blowing out of the shop. Seconds later, we saw her taillights speed down the road. I turned back to my staff and saw that all of them had pulled out their phones already.

I wasn’t upset. We were ahead in our cleaning, and the real boss was gone. At this point in the evening, we were just running down the clock, anyway. I just prayed no fires broke out in the last few hours we were open. Seemed simple enough.

About twenty minutes after Mary left, the restaurant’s phone started ringing. It gave us all a shock - we’d never heard the phone ring in here before. Hell, Jenna admitted she’d actually never seen a landline in person before tonight. The phone was in Mary’s office. Jenna, Doug and I made our way over there. Reggie was in his own world and we didn’t bother him.

“Should I answer?” I asked.

“You’re the boss,” Doug said.

“What if it’s a supplier with questions about, I dunno, stock or something?”

“No supplier is going to call a store at close to ten o’clock at night,” Jenna said.

“It could be Mr. Adamyan,” I said. “What we he think if he called and Mary didn’t answer?”

“Just tell him she’s taking a huge shit and she’ll call him back,” Doug said. “Guarantee he won’t ask any follow-up questions.”

“Vile, Doug,” Jenna said, her face twisting in disgust.

“I solve problems Jenna. Sometimes that means going a vile route. Oh shit…vile route. That’s a banger,” Doug said, jotting the note into his lyric book.

“I’m gonna answer,” I said. I walked into Mary’s office and plucked the receiver up from the cradle. “Hello?”

“Hey, this is Paul over at Burger’s Ahoy.”

“Uh, hi? If you want something, just come over and order. We’re super slow.”

“No thanks. I was calling to ask if you knew that you have a dude who’s been standing at your drive through speaker for, like, ten minutes?”

“What?” I asked, confused. When someone pulls up to the drive through speaker, a whole host of things happen. A timer starts, bells ring, and the staff jumps into action. But nothing ever sounded. The shop had been quiet. I told Paul as much.

“Well, we’ve been watching him for a while. He’s just…standing there. It’s unsettling.”

“What’s going on? Who is it?” Jenna asked.

“Paul from Burgers Ahoy. He says someone’s been standing at the drive through speaker for ten minutes.”

“Why the fuck would he do that?” Doug asked.

“You want me to send you a video? Gimmie your number and I’ll text it over. It’s so weird,” Paul said.

“Hold up. Let me have someone check our monitors,” I said. I turned to Doug, but was already heading that way. A few seconds later, I heard him yell back that there wasn’t anything on the screen. I told Paul.

“I don’t know what to tell you. Everyone here sees it. He’s wearing a long black trench-coat and, I dunno, those old hats from, like, the 1930s. A derby I think?”

I gave Paul my number and told him to send me the video. I got the number to Burgers Ahoy and told him I’d call him back as soon as we watched it. He told us to be safe and hung up. A few seconds later, my phone dinged. I had a new text message.

“Hold up,” Jenna said, pulling out her phone, “I am 100% taking video of all of this. Ghost things go NUTS on TikTok.”

“Doug, call Reggie in here,” I said.

“I dunno, man. That dude gives me the squirmy squiggles and shit. Maybe he’s the haunted one?”

“Come on, he’s new and shy. You remember what it was like being the new guy here?”

He relented and went to grab Reggie. Once we were all back in the room, I pressed play on the video. The first image was the bright, pirate themed interior of Burgers Ahoy. Doug snorted. “They need a mascot, too.”

“Lemme guess, Mr. Burger?” Reggie said, to our surprise. We all laughed.

“Score one for the new guy,” Jenna said, elbowing his arm. Reggie blushed.

“Okay, so, like I was saying,” Paul said on the video, “this dude has just been standing by the speaker for ten minutes. Not moving, not ordering. Just…standing and, like, looking all old and shit.” Another employee at Burgers Ahoy yelled, “Aww man, the taco place done have a ghost!”

The video was shaky and got worse as Paul zoomed in. Jenna let out an annoyed sigh, “Get some basic camera control, will you, burger boy?” Once the image of our drive through came into focus, we all gasped. Sure enough, there was a man standing right next to our drive through speaker. He looked just like Paul said. Wearing a long black trench-coat and a derby hat.

We all jumped when the office phone started ringing again. After the initial scare, we all started laughing. Even Reggie smiled. I picked up. “Well, was I lying?” Paul asked.

“No, that’s pretty weird.”

“One of you should go check it out,” he said.

“Absolutely not,” I said. “Not in a million years, dude.”

“What’s he saying?” Doug asked.

“He said someone should go check it out.”

“Oh my God,” Jenna said.

“My thoughts exactly.”

“If you go, you need to record it for my page!” Jenna added.

“Yo, tag me in the description! I’m  u thadougfather2.”

“There were two ‘thadougfathers?’” I asked.

“Yeah, and the fake dougfather got zero bars.”

“Do you want me to go out with you?” Paul asked. “I’m curious.”

“When did we decide I was going out?” I said into the speaker

“You’re the boss lady,” Doug said.

“And you’re the nicest and the least threatening,” Jenna added.

“I’d skip it,” Reggie said. “Not worth the trouble.”

“Whatever, new guy. Votes two to one. You gotta go.”

“I don’t get a vote?” I asked.

“Come on, Jill. Can’t make the Más Tacos crew seem like a bunch of bitches,” Doug said. “I’ll keep an eye on Jenna. Reggie will keep an eye on Reggie. You keep an eye and, more importantly, the camera on the ghost,” Doug said. “It’s win/win, girl.”

I looked up at them and sighed. Paul heard and sighed back. “If it helps, I drew the short straw, too,” he said. “Managers gotta manage all situations, right?”

“I’m just temping as manager and nowhere does it say I have to go confront creepy weirdos standing motionless in the drive through line.”

“I know, but I keep circling back to what happens at the end of our shifts if this guy is still there. My guess is we both work with some people who aren’t dealing from a full deck,” Paul confided to me. “That said, I don’t want to see any of them get hurt.”

Fuck. He had me there. I didn’t want to see that either. “Is the guy still there? He’s not showing up on our screens.”

“Julie! Is the guy still…oh..okay. Yeah, he’s still there.”

“Meet me in between the restaurants and we’ll walk over together. If you try anything, I have mace and I’m not above kicking a guy in the dick.”

Paul laughed, “Save that energy for the ghost guy.”

We hung up. My crew looked at me and there was genuine excitement in their eyes. I couldn’t blame him. This was easily the most engaging thing that’s happened to Más Tacos since we introduced the Churro Shake.

“Okay,” I started, “I’m meeting Paul from Burgers Ahoy and we’re going to go check on this guy. If anything happens, please call the police and then Mary.”

Jenna held out her phone. “I’m entrusting Sasha to you. Please get good footage - no shaky shit like your burger boy.”

I took her phone. “He’s not my burger boy.”

“Maybe you should stay away?” Reggie said.

“Where was this energy earlier?” I asked, throwing up my hands.

“You ever dealt with anything like this before?” Reggie asked. “Have any of you?”

“Oh shit, are you the little boy from the Sixth Sense?” Jenna said. We all laughed, but it was more from nerves than the zinger.

“I’ve had some weird shit happen to me before. It could attach itself to you.”

“Don’t listen to the new guy,” Doug said. “This could blow up online. A haunted taco shop? Shiiiit, Mr. Taco and Taco Land might become a reality if this hits!”

“Just keep an eye on the monitor,” I said.

“I’ll record that so we can combine videos later,” Doug said . He put his two hands together and formed a circle. “Symbolic shit,” he said with a cocksure grin.

“I think you mean ‘symbiotic’,” I said, standing near the side door.

“Whatever English textbook. Go meet a ghost.”

I walked out into the crisp fall night and felt a chill wrap around my body. I rubbed my arms with my hands and thought about anything warm. As I took a few steps away from the restaurant, the smell of burnt hair stung my nostrils. I gave my outfit a quick sniff, but it wasn’t me. Before I could explore further, I caught my first glimpse of Paul heading over.

He was a lanky boy with swept over brown hair. He had on an old, faded hoodie that clung to his body. Paul had a baby face, but I didn’t hate it. From this distance, I enjoyed the view.

Paul clocked me and gave me a small, friendly wave. I waved back and walked over to him. He was cute in an “aww shucks” kinda way. I dug him. Maybe there was a silver lining to all this nonsense after all.

“Sorry if this ruins your night,” he said. “But it was really freaking us out.”

“No, no, it’s okay. How often do you get to see a ghost up close?”

“It may not be a ghost,” Paul offered.

“We can’t see him on our cameras.”

“Well, we don’t have to get that close. Let’s just confirm he’s there and head back.”

“Then what?”

He shrugged. “Call the Ghostbusters?”

I laughed. “I have a proton pack in my car, if things get crazy.”

“Just don’t cross the streams, huh?”

That cemented my little growing crush. I might have to stop by Burgers Ahoy more often. In fact, I might be the only customer they have that entire day.

We made our way over to the side of our building and started inching along the wall. We passed the second drive-through window, and I peaked inside. Jenna, Doug, and Reggie  were watching me on the security cameras. I remembered to pull up Jenna’s camera and pressed record. I aimed it at Paul.

“Paul, do you have anything to say before we encounter the dead?”

“Yes, Jill. Please buy me a Churro Shake after this. For my troubles.”

I laughed. “If we survive, I’ll give you one, free of charge.”

“I don’t think Mr. Adamyan will appreciate you giving stuff away. I gave a homeless guy an unpicked up DoorDash order once, and he threatened to fire me.”

I stopped walking. “Wait, Mr. Adamyan owns Burgers Ahoy and Más Tacos? That man sure knows how to pick’em.”

“We all have faults. Me? I like bad horror movies. Mr. Adamyan? The man loves failing off brand fast-food franchises.”

“Maybe the Bank of Chester is funding his addiction?”

“Where is Chester, anyway?”

“I thought it was a person!” I said, excitedly.

Before we could continue our back and forth, an electric popping sound filled our ears and the entire strip lost power, plunging us into darkness. Out of instinct, I leaned against the building, trying to hide. Paul joined me in hugging the wall.

“What the hell?” he whispered.

“I…I don’t know.”

BANG! BANG! BANG! Someone beat on the glass of the drive-through window. I let out a scared yelp before I reached my hands up and snatched it back into my throat. Someone pulled open the window. It was Doug.

“Doug, what the hell?”

“Jill, the power went out.”

“I know! You scared the hell out of me.”

“We saw the ghost! It looked just like your burger boy said it did!” Jenna yelled from behind him.

“Burger boy?” Paul said.

I ignored him. “Where did you see it?”

“On the drive-through screen. He…he looked at us before the power went out.”

“What?”

“He looked pissed off,” Doug unhelpfully added.

“Fantastic,” I whispered. “Is everyone okay?”

“I’m chilling. Jenna was freaking out, but she’s okay.”

“And Reggie?”

“Huh…Yo! Reg the sledge, you feeling okay?”

Reggie didn’t respond. Doug yelled again, but the result was the same. My team had lost a team member in the ten minutes I was away from them. Mary’s job is so much harder than it seems.

I sighed. “Where did he go?”

“Maybe we should head back…” Paul started, but the KACHING of the drive through menu lights returning to life cut him off. They were the only lights that came back on.

We cheated off the wall and craned our necks toward the light like moths looking for a fix. Our jaws dropped. Reggie was standing there.

“Reggie! What are you doing?”

“They’re…they’re back,” he said, his voice trembling. “I…I can’t move.”

The lights went out again. Everything around us went still. The smell of burnt hair filled the surrounding air. I twisted around to see if there was something behind us, but only saw Doug and Jenna fighting for window space. I turned back to a very confused Paul.

“Do you smell…”

BRAAA-AMMMP! BRAAA-AMMMP! BRAAA-AMMMP!

A booming bass rained down on us. Time stood still. I felt the push from the sound wave ripple across my body. The force caused me to stumble to one knee. I clamped my hands on my ears to block out the bellowing, but it was in vain. I felt my eardrums vibrate and begin squealing. This was unlike anything I’d ever heard before.

The drive through menu lights exploded, shooting glass shards at a terrified and exposed Reggie. He raised his hands to block the glass. In the last flashes of light, I saw jagged red cuts open up on his pale white skin. With that, we were in the dark again.

Through my hand muffed ears, I heard a high-pitched jolt of sound blow out and shatter every piece of glass in a twenty-foot radius. The Más Tacos drive-through window cracked into three large pieces and fell to the ground. It shattered into glass rubble. With the barrier to the restaurant gone, I clearly heard Jenna’s horrified screams. Doug was yelling something, but the sky’s soundtrack made it impossible to hear.

I shut my eyes. Mary had never warned me about this. The rumbling from the sky was so intense, I felt my bones rattle and my innards quake. I let out a scream my ancestors could hear. It, too, became lost to the soundscape. Seconds later, the booming call from the gods came to a rapid crescendo before dropping out completely. There wasn’t even an echo. The only noise I heard was the last gasps of my throat cracking scream.

My voice finally died out, and I collapsed onto the ground. I couldn’t find my breath and panic quickly set in. In a flash, I sat up and gasped for air like a dying goldfish. When I finally captured my foe and took several huge gulps. Once I avoided death, I threw up my dinner. I remember seeing an ant near the pile and thinking, Well, dude, that should set you up for the year.

When I finally got my wits about me, I pushed up and got to my unsteady feet. I noticed Paul had also collapsed to the ground. He slowly stood up and shook away the cobwebs. It didn’t work. His eyes looked wild and shock froze his face. His mind had cracked like a tree zapped with lightning. He was trapped under the trunk. Panic was setting in.

I reached out and grabbed his hand. It was clammy and cold in my grip. We locked eyes, and I started speaking, but nothing came out. My voice was shot. I coughed to clear my throat. Nothing happened at first, but when my body remembered to make saliva, it cleared up the alphabet jam in my mouth.

“We’re alive,” I croaked out as I grabbed his shoulders. “I’m here and we’re alive.”

His eyelids lowered, and you could see his body purge the fear from his system. Beads of sweat covered his face, and he wiped his brow with the back of his free hand. Both hands were shaking. I remembered I was still holding him, but instead of letting go, I gave him a slight squeeze. Reminding him he wasn’t alone. I found it calming as well. A human connection in an alien world.

Doug’s screaming finally broke through. I turned back to see him frantically pointing at the sky. I looked up and saw a kaleidoscope of bright, colorful lights shifting and swirling above us. It was mesmerizing. It reminded me of paint meeting water. Darkening and swirling - no pattern to follow. Jenna was screaming as well. Without hearing her words, I knew what she wanted. I reached around me and found her phone. I hit record and aimed it up at the sky.

Her screen captured the electric northern lights as they danced above us. There wasn’t a single sound emanating from this craft - it just hovered in the sky and showed us the most incredible Christmas light display any of us have ever seen. “This must be what you see before you die,” I said out loud, but not meaning to.

“One can hope,” Paul answered, mesmerized.

I realized we were still holding hands.

I glanced over at Paul and noticed blotches of red on his face. It wasn’t bloody cuts like Reggie had sustained, but more like a sunburn. Oh shit…Reggie. Where was he?

“Reggie!?” I screamed.

No response. I ran over to where he’d been standing, once again catching a whiff of something burning. Hair or some chemical. A horrid thought filled my brain. Is that Paul’s skin burning or my own?

From behind me, I heard Paul walk over. When I got to the drive through speaker, there was no sight of Reggie, but the smell of burnt hair hung heavy in the air. I waved it away from my face and called out to him again.

“REGGIE!”

He wasn’t there.

“Where did he go?” Paul asked, joining me.

“They…they must’ve taken him.”

“Who’s they? What the hell is going on?”

“Yo! Behind you!” Doug yelled from the window.

In the shadows of the drive-through landscaping, we saw three figures crouched in the darkness of the nearby bushes. The burnt hair smell wafted heavily from their direction. They didn’t move an inch, even after Doug outed them.

Paul took a nervous step back. “This shit ain’t worth twelve and hour.”

I reached back and grabbed his arm, cementing him in place. “You can’t leave me here.”

A crinkling sound emerged from the bushes. A rhythmic clicking answered the crinkles. Two of the figures in the bushes moved slightly. The crinkling and clicking became more rapid, almost as if they these two things were arguing.

They went quiet again. The bushes shook and the silent third figure walked out. My eyes caught the growing intensity of the busted drive-through light bulbs re-illuminating. They were back from the dead. The shattered filament emitters provided enough light to expose what this thing really looked like.

It was the derby man.

Up close, what we assumed had been a ghost was, in truth, an actual creature. It appeared to be a man from the 1930s, but it was impossible to distinguish any specific facial features. It was an unfinished drawing. From afar, it was a person. Up close, though, that melted away. It hit the right notes, sure, but the song was off.

At that moment, the idea of the uncanny valley came crashing into my frontal cortex. We fear things that look like us but aren’t us. This thing wasn’t us. Not at all.

Paul reached for my hand and found it. We didn’t move. Hell, we hardly breathed. The derby man took another step toward us. The closer he got, the more abnormal he looked. His face shared the same swirling watercolor paint that was saw in the sky.

I remember thinking, why was he dressed like Philip Marlowe? In a flash, I wondered if the last time these things were here was during that era. His clothing would’ve blended in then, but now made him stand out. He came back, assuming he could mimic us and discovered we’d changed.

“The fuck is this?” Paul asked, his voice wavering. He tightened his grip.

The thing before us chittered and crinkled as if it was responding in a tongue neither of us knew. It took a step toward Paul and I felt his body brace to run. I squeezed his hand. A subtle reminder we were attached.

“Don’t make any sudden movements,” I cautioned. “We don’t know what they want.”

The derby man stood in front of Paul. It looked him up and down. It reached into the pocket of the trench-coat and pulled out a small, hand-held device. At first blush, we both thought it was a weapon. Then a puff of smoke burst out and settled around us. It smelled like burnt hair and freshly cooked donuts.

At any other time, these two concurrent smells would repulse anyone. But, at this moment, they smelled amazing. My body relaxed. The tips of my fingers and toes went numb. I had to remember to squeeze Jenna’s phone tight or else I would’ve dropped it.

Oh my God…I still had her phone.

It…it was still recording. I swallowed hard and tried to not let on that I was doing anything clandestine. I wasn’t sure what I had captured up to this point, but I knew that Jenna’s follower count was about to swell like a tick on a sleeping dog.

The creature twisted its hand, and a glass lens appeared. The derby man punched a few buttons and a red, horizontal laser shot out the front. Paul flinched, but stayed put. The laser scanned him from head to toe and then winked out.

The derby man crinkled, chittered, and clicked at us. Maybe it said something profound, but I’ll never know. It sounded like birds in the woods to me.

Seconds later, the derby man shook as if seizures gripped his body. It ripped off the clothes it had been wearing. Its body wasn’t human. He was a Ken doll. Paul and I both took a few steps back, wondering if this thing was going to explode. Would it attack? Kidnap us like it had Reggie?

Instead, the tearing of flesh filled the air. Rips opened up across the watery painted face and down his human looking skin. Blood spurt from burst open veins. That’s when it hit me. It was shedding.

The husk landed on the cement with a wet slap. Seconds later, the lump of blobby skin dissolved into nothing. We turned our attention back to the creature. The bloody pulp moved around and a new form emerged from the ether.

It looked exactly like Paul.

The thing chittered again. His voice had deepened. They pressed another button and the musky donut smell dissipated. My mind cleared and the terror I’d been feeling rushed into the void.

The two beings that had been hiding in the bushes emerged. One looked strikingly like Reggie. The other, like me. My body went liquid, and I started to faint. I stumbled, but Paul caught me before I split my head open on the road. The two human puppets joined their pal in front of us. The smell of burnt hair was overwhelming. They clicked and chittered for a minute before another ear splitting boom erupted above our heads.

A flash of white light above us was so intense, it made our little section of the strip mall look like noon. I shut my eyes and covered my ears again. The ringing boom ended as quickly as it had begun. I opened my eyes and beheld a new world. It looked like ours but felt changed. Uncanny valley, I thought. I’d laid eyes on something I wasn’t supposed to see and I felt like I was waking from a long, detailed dream.

The figures were gone. A naked and befuddled Reggie was in their place. He didn’t look injured, save for several minor cuts on his arms and face. I noticed an intricate pattern of seven triangles across his thigh. At a glance, I thought it was a tribal tattoo, but then I clocked they were scars. Six were old, and the seventh was oozing blood.

It clicked in that moment that Reggie had seen these guys before. He’d tried to tell me earlier, but I wasn’t hearing what he had been saying. I ran to him and shook him. His eyes fluttered open, and he looked at me in a haze.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“It happened again, didn’t it?”

Though Paul was struggling with what had happened, he had enough sense to peel off his hoodie and hand it to Reggie. “You look cold.”

Reggie thanked him and put it on. “I’m sorry I brought this onto you all.”

“What happened?”

“They always come back.”

Jenna and Doug burst out of the door and rushed over to us. They were both jabbering, but it came at us as another wave of noise. Over it, I heard Doug rambling through all the things we just experienced and Jenna begging for her phone. I felt it in my hand. Without thinking, I handed it to her.

“What the hell?” she said.

“What?” I finally asked.

“Nothing recorded. It shows a file but says it’s corrupted.”

“They do that,” Reggie said. “I’ve never been able to capture them.”

“Well that sucks,” Jenna said. I gave her a look, and she softened. “Sorry, Reggie, here. I grabbed you a towel.”

We only had hand towels. It didn’t cover everything but the important bits. We helped him up off the ground and formed a little wall around him to give him some privacy.

“Oh shit,” Doug said. “The fuck happened there?”

He was staring at the Bank of Chester. A thick layer of raised black soot decorated the bricks. The soot formed the same pattern that was marked on Reggie’s thigh. The spaces between the pattern appeared washed out, as if the sun had faded the stone.

“Mr. Adamyan is going to be pissed,” Doug said.

The fury at what Mr. Adamyan might think was the last thing on my mind. Doug approached the wall to touch the soot, but a stern yelp from Jenna stopped him in his tracks. “What if it’s poisonous, idiot?”

“True,” he said, sheepishly. They helped escort Reggie back into the restaurant.

Paul and I stared at each other. There was so much to say, but the words couldn’t find the way out. Eventually, I found my voice. “So, it wasn’t a ghost.”

He laughed. “Don’t have to worry about making that call to Egon, now.”

“Just the Men in Black, I suppose.”

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“Not really. You?”

“No. I…I think I’m going to close the store early.”

“Same,” I said. “Do you want to talk about this over coffee?”

“I was thinking a stiff drink or ten.”

I laughed. “Know a place?”

“Yeah. I’ll text you the address,” he said. “I should get back and see how my people are doing.”

“Burgers ahoy,” I said, instantly regretting it.

“Burgers ahoy,” he repeated with a small smile. He gave me a little wave as he left.

I walked back towards Más Tacos and started laughing. Not because anything was funny - far from it - but because my mind and body didn’t know how to respond to so much simultaneous stimuli. I was a mess, sure, and dreaded the future conversations with Mary about what had gone down tonight, but I was moving forward and that’s all I could ask of myself at the moment. There’d be a realization, tears and nightmares later, but I wasn’t letting that get to me. I was in survival mode. Keep marching.

Work now, cry later.

The smell of burnt hair filled my nostrils again. I turned back and scanned the shadows, but nothing stood out. I listened for either chittering or clicking and heard neither. In my gut, I knew they were still here. Watching. Waiting. Taking stock of us. How had we responded? Would we fight them?

1gmgiph,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gmgiph/diagnosis_and_repair_notes_for_hissing_sound_from/,Diagnosis and repair notes for hissing sound from within the machine and boiler plumbing connections [Lelit Bianca],"Repair notes on my Bianca V1 should anyone be searching for the same in the years to come.. principles if not specifics may also be applicable to other machines.

My Bianca V1 started making a hissing sound from within the machine, and where it was previously releasing steam from the valve below the grouphead and was fixed by replacing the steam safety valve with very helpful advice from DaveC of [https://coffeetime.freeflarum.com/d/247-lelit-bianca-steam-escaping/20](https://coffeetime.freeflarum.com/d/247-lelit-bianca-steam-escaping/20) this time there was no visible release of steam externally.

Opening the top of the machine I could hear the hissing but couldn't see any steam or moisture and couldn't locate which of several connections to the boiler might be the culprit.

To diagnose this, I got my spanner set from the garage, thinking to try cracking each connection in turn looser and tighter but... once I had the spanners out, it turns out there's a better way.

The spanners are polished and shiny, and they were really quite cold... as I held the spanner near each connection but didn't actually bind it to the hot nut, the very small stream of steam, invisible to naked eye, condensed upon the cold steel, making it easy to locate which nut was leaking as the shiny steel misted over. 

If they were warm this wouldn't be noticeable, but if you have to do this in the summer, put a spanner (or a spoon, or a table knife or an inspection mirror even etc) in the fridge for an hour or two and once it's cold it makes identifying the leak much easier.

Having identified that it was the Steam Boiler Temperature Probe, the fix was to remove it *when the machine was cold* and wrap a little PTFE tape around the thread and put it back.

Clive's Coffee has excellent guides on how to operate and repair many machines, and in my case this page shows the specific nut in question

[https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/lelit-bianca-checking-the-steam-boiler-temperature-probe](https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/lelit-bianca-checking-the-steam-boiler-temperature-probe)

but while that links to this page on how to remove the panels

[https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/lelit-bianca-panel-removal](https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/lelit-bianca-panel-removal)

it wasn't clear *why* that was needed. 

But in short, as you unscrew the nut the probe lead will twist and twist (and same on re-assembly) so it's a good idea to remove the panels, unplug the lead before removing the probe, and the replace the probe and rethread and reattach the control wires, to minimise loads on the wiring and the chance of breaking something.

And that was made much easier with the help of this video from Hoons Coffee on the disassembly.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpJKD2Nu794](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpJKD2Nu794)

In short, it took longer to find out how to diagnose and fix it than the fix itself actually took (about 20 minutes including disassembly and reassembly).

I think later revisions of the Bianca may have a little more sealant applied to the threads, but hopefully the above is of some use to whoever next is trying to track down and fix such a leak without having to return a large and heavy machine to a repair centre.

There is a bunch of stuff that happened during the day that wasn't shown in the episode. Avinash and the step sisters decided to trouble Sara by hiding stevia. She's the only one who uses Stevia so it won't affect anyone except her.
They stole it and hid it. They were waiting for her to look for it. Avinash later stole Shrutika's last spoon of coffee from right under her nose. He hid it and Shrutika and Avinash had a whole fight. 
KV said they should check bags and they went to check everyone's bag. At this point Avinash said he has also stolen Stevia and some other stuff. 

Sara's breakdown was a result of build up from the first week and it's mostly against the maker's blatant bias towards vivian and chugli gang. 
Her tipping point was that the task sanchalak was also vivian and she lost her chance to be time god.

While I do not justify the vile stuff she said, she had the gall to say it in front of everyone whereas ewsha and elis have said much worse behind people's back. They do not have my sympathy. 

PS - I think that it's the maker's strategy to favor some contestants so it sparks reactions from others. That's the theme of the season. They can't act surprised now that their bias triggered someone to this extent in 4 weeks.

I've been on and off antidepressants since I was 16 - they don't do much for me at all. I'm currently taking 200mg of Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and 40mg Elvanse. I'm finding stimulant ADHD meds far too much for me. I was put on Ritalin first, then changed to Concerta and then finally Elvanse. All 3 stimulant meds gave me anxiety, heart palpitations, feelings of impending doom, paranoia etc. I once had a coffee after taking my meds and I needed to take the day off work I felt that bad. I'm wondering if anyone else has ever experienced similar - and if so did non stimulant ADHD meds work better for you? I've heard mixed opinions on the non stimulant meds. 

I have a diagnosis of ADHD, bipolar 3, BPD/EUPD, C-PTSD and currently awaiting my autism assessment. Not convinced I have bipolar 3 or BPD.

I really want to try and find ADHD meds that work for me, because I struggle so badly with lack of motivation, concentration, impulsivity etc and feel so envious of those with ADHD that find meds that help with all of that. I'm starting to lose hope 😞",2,1731065268.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

wanderer recently celebrated it’s 10th anniversary. Well, as far as minor versions go at least.

First and foremost: What is wanderer?  
wanderer is a self-hosted GPS track database. You can upload your recorded GPS tracks or create new ones and add various metadata to build an easily searchable catalogue. Think of it as a fully FOSS alternative to sites like alltrails, komoot or strava.

Next: Thank you for almost 1.2k stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/Flomp/wanderer). It’s a great motivation to see how well-received wanderer is.

By far the most requested feature since my last post was the possibility to track your acitivities. This is now possible on the new profile page which shows various statistics to help you gain better insights into your trailing/running/biking habits. Lists have also received a major upgrade allowing you easily bundle a multiday hike and share it with other users.

https://i.redd.it/s0qji8wdxnzd1.gif

If you want to give wanderer a try without installing it you can try the [demo](https://demo.wanderer.to/). When you are ready to self-host it you can head over to [wanderer.to](http://wanderer.to) to see the full documentation and installation guide.

If you really like wanderer and would like to support its development directly you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/wanderertrails).

We had a huge argument when it ended and other than a few texts here and there hadn't spoken or seen each other since.

When they came over I asked how their day was and they asked about mine, she was nervous and I asked if they were, she said yes her tummy was in knots, and i said i was nervous too.  Then we just looked at each other in a second that said ""we had some times, how did we end up here"".  Then she got emotional and started to cry saying how it hard it had been for them, we spent nearly 5 years together and she still retains love for me.

I said that she knew how i felt, and while we cant be together likely ever the thought brings me some comfort at times even if we bump into each other in 5 years time.  We exchanged items caught up a bit.  I've been to the gym solidly the last few months and look totally different, better dressed and groomed and have a nice new house.  She looked the same but she said i looking ""effing unreal"" and could tell how hard I had worked on myself, seeing all the books I have read on my shelf. 

Once we exchanged items, she asked if i wanted a hug, and we stood there embracing for a few minutes.  We chatted somemore and then again hugged again.  She said she would get in touch about going for a coffee before Christmas.  I took her things to her car and then we shared one final hug and looked at each other, and she left.

Best ways to sleep or survive / feel good during long hours of sitting?
(in airplanes , train or bus).

How do you cope with sitting for many hours in long haul flights ? For me it's terrible.
It's almost a prison, where you can't sleep properly , nor do exercise properly.

Could you confirm the only way is RESTING a lot BEFORE and aftet the trip? so that i got enough energy to keep up and move / exercise? (even just keeping Upright is a long challenging PHYSICAL EXERCISE). 
This way I wouldn't feel too much PAIN in my sacrum or back / legs area (yes  I, still feel it even with a cushion).

Also KEEPING FIT (working out daily) so my body abs and back are strong enough to keep my body up without collapsing easily.


Sleeping is impossible as even if I use 3 memory foam and portable pillows (taken from a vacuum seal bag) and sit by the window, as The leg space is stupidly very little, unless I book the expensive xl seats.

If you don't lie down or recline the chair enough (just a little is possible),
At some point Body starts to feel pain or tension, so it will wake up or stay up a bit.

Most travel articles say you shall be SLEEPY before a flight,  but that's totally WRONG,
if you don't have energy you really struggle to sit up and you need to do that unless you got a free seat next to you. So your body will feel STRESSED and you'll suffer for the whole flight, as you NEED to lie down but you cannot. (coffee and sugars to keep you up are not a good solution, as they give you fake energy and you feel worse afterwards).

Furthermore , Controversially , I would keep warm and AVOID ENTERTAINMENT, music (unless got really noisy neighbours), lots of talking and lights, also heavy meals during evening/ night (which they always serve, that's crazy!),
as the brain needs ENERGY to process all sounds, lights and information, and lots of energy to digest meals late. (try sleeping/ recharging in complete darkness and silence and another time with bright screens and music on, you'll understand what I mean).

But you NEED a lot of ENERGY to keep upright and also move / stretch (Body takes energy also to process the discomfort you feel when your sacrum presses on the seat for a long time, so using cushions and standing up sometimes too is really important)
, during the whole 15-20 hours flight / sitting, 
and as I said keeping Upright is a long challenging PHYSICAL EXERCISE, which requires a good amount of Energy.

The more energy you got, the LESS you'll SUFFER.

If you get bored, move, stretch or simply do some silent meditation (I use a timer which I increase progressively and relax with closed eyes/ eye mask).

Good Noise cancelling earbuds or headphones really help to reduce loud motor and other sounds.

If your flight doesn't start early morning,  most likely it will happen during NIGHT,  when we all want to SLEEP.
So I think the best thing is booking extra legroom seats,  to sleep (80£ more) or the seats near you if travelling with Etihad.

Otherwise making your flight a Physical exercise as explained, planning to rest well before and after the flight, messing up your circadian rhythm a bit.

Justice Michael Wheelahan dismissed the claims of Moccona’s maker – the $15 billion American-Dutch coffee giant Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) – saying that there was little chance consumers couldn’t tell the difference between the two brands.

JDE had claimed that Vittoria’s 400g glass jar, used to sell freeze-dried instant coffee, has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct and that consumers might mistake Vittoria’s products for Moccona.

In his judgment delivered on Thursday, Justice Wheelahan said the Moccona jar had a “fairly squat body” that sits beneath a “slowly sloping shoulder and a tall lid” which makes up about a third of the jar’s overall height.

Meanwhile, he said, customers would see the Vittoria jar as “noticeably taller in its proportions, with a compressed neck section, and a plain, low lid”.

“I do not consider there to be a real, tangible risk that a notional buyer, with a recollection only of the [Moccona] shape mark’s rough proportions and general shape, would be perplexed, mixed up, caused to wonder, or left in doubt, about whether instant coffee sold in the [Vittoria] jar shape has the same commercial source as coffee sold in the [Moccona] shape mark,” Justice Wheelahan stated.

“I conclude that the [Vittoria] jar shape is not deceptively similar to the [Moccona] shape mark. On this basis, too, I find that the applicants’ infringement case must fail.”",110,1731064169.0,australia,39,0.97,False

Now she docked 50% of my pay for a shift I worked because I stayed and helped longer even though I was supposed to, so I'm making a paper trail and need advice.","Hello, this is my first post and really first time properly on reddit so please go easy on me. \*All names are fake even if I don't clarify! I posted it to my account because I don't know how reddit works and it is quite long. I'm sorry in advance I understand that reddit has its own etiquette and I am not familiar with it!

I don't know too well how to put this, but I have worked a seasonal job for about a year. We work Christmas and Easter and we make personalized holiday “moments.” My area manager is my music teacher and honestly just an amazing woman (I'll call her Gayle). However, my regional manager, who is higher up, is a monster (fake name Becky.) There are a lot of red flags I'm noticing and since the season is about to start up again, I think I'm just looking for some advice. Also it should be noted that Becky is from CA while we live in NV, I’m only mentioning this in case someone who is familiar with labor laws in NV or anything of the sort can help me out.

I started last Christmas when I was 17 and Gayle, who is around 60-70 I'm not quite sure, hired me from our music lessons. I graduated HS at 16 and have yet to go to college. There I worked with two other associates, however one quit early and the other one was hired late in the season. There were also 2 assistant managers, Lizzie (\~55F) who took quite a few smoke breaks, the other was Gayle's daughter- Aubrey (\~33F) As well as an older male who was a constant because he worked the same shift every day, but not too much relating to what I did other than we had to kinda take care of him because he couldn’t move from his post except for break.

We were scheduled so it was usually one Assistant Manager with an associate from opening to 3 where we took an hour break from 3 to 4, and then there would be a rotation of a different AM with a different Associate. For most of the season I was the only associate, so the schedule was Gayle with me , Gayle with AM, or AM with me.. I had an appointment on training day so I missed it, but I was assured that there would be time to make up for it. However, it's a seasonal job and working at a mall at Christmas is a hellscape so we quickly did not have time to train. Luckily, I picked up on it fast and was great doing the sales side of the job. Even for being understaffed I enjoyed it, and it was good money.

I had known that Becky had heard about me and loved me because I was the top salesperson of a specific merchandise in our county, which is stupidly overpriced and rarely purchased (to preface the goal me and gayle set was 14 for me because I was doing so well but I ended up selling around 30). Becky had come by once during the season, however I was not there that day. Aubrey told me that she ended up actually working as an associate (which apparently rarely happens) and she wore my apron with my nametag on it as a joke. I was constantly hearing from Gayle all that they were talking about and how much they both loved me. As much as I had spoken to her (over the phone, or through Gayle while she was on the phone) I never met her.

Looking back at it there was a lot that was wrong that I just shoved down because I was too busy. There was an issue with the old male coworker that I felt would be pushed to the side if I spoke up about it, Not by Gayle but she couldn't do anything about it since he was hired by Becky and we didn't have a replacement. As a younger female it's not something I am unfamiliar with however, I still have lasting anxiety from the situation as it occurred throughout the whole season. I resorted to using pinterest face claims as my wallpaper and claiming it was my boyfriend and wearing a fake ring, that was the only thing that made him stop talking to me. I still do these things whenever I leave the house.

There was a security camera that watched this employee due to his post, it was linked to corporate where they viewed it. If any employee that wasn't him was seen sitting or even so much as leaning on his chair/post we would get in trouble. If the camera saw us not in the correct uniform, eating, sitting, drinking water, they would tell off Gayle and inform her to then tell us off. Lizzie, who was not in the best physical condition and was always coughing or in pain, brought a chair for us to sit on off camera and a table to organize our products when the sets were being created. During busy days we would have 2-3+ in-person orders at a time meaning that the machine would scramble them and we would have to organize the sets per party ourselves, if they weren't there the products would fall on the floor. 

I wasn't too familiar with the rule that we weren't allowed to consume any food or drink on the premises because when working on busy days we often had to take snacks and drinks there and just put them in a cupboard. The only person allowed to was the older male, but we had to get it for him. This manchild was so annoying to run errands for, this was something I knew I had to do but didn't know I had to do for an actual toddler. We had a little food stand next us but he “Didn't like how their water tastes” so one of us would have to go up a slow/broken elevator to starbucks to get this man his right water, or sometimes coffee/snack. But we, the people whose jobs were to move around and NEVER sit were refused. I would usually offer to go and then get myself a drink if I could because I found it ridiculous that we weren’t allowed to drink anything at all. Mind you I understand not eating, and it's not like we all brought last night's leftovers and a microwave and ate it during our shift but when you are standing 7+ hours straight and break was supposed to be 2 hours ago, you need something to ensure you aren't going to pass out. And frankly denying people water is quite literally torture. Luckily we all agreed on this and just never told Becky and never stood in front of the camera. 

(super important note) People would try to sneak pictures with their phones of our Photo Opt which was a **copyrighted set**. Meaning that if we don't catch it we could get in serious trouble. It is quite literally a violation of copyright laws to take a personal photo without our cameras of the area. All we can do is politely tell them no about 200 times we never were told that we had the right to refuse service, probably because of how money hungry the company is.

At the end of that season the company enforced a new policy (another important note) where we couldn't tell walk ups the price of our products… yep that's literally it. They would have to customize it, we create it and then ring them up and give them the shock of $50+ of random junk. Oh and we couldn't offer them anything but the biggest “package” unless they asked, leading to many people cursing at a 17 year old girl who wasn't in charge of a thing. The website for people who made a reservation was misleading and told people that they would get it digital only when we NEVER offered that. 

In the last 3 days of us being open there was a text that was sent out as a group text to staff that the CEO of the company would be visiting that day. The girl who was hired late in the season was 16 and had a lot of social anxiety. I used to have a lot of social anxiety as well, however now it just comes through phases but I always tried my best to make sure she wasn't overwhelmed as I know how it feels. She was very anxious and it was visibly stressing her out, come to find out he never showed. I have a very strong feeling that he never even knew that we thought he was going to come here. We sent pictures of him in the group chat to try and see if we could just “customer service smile” the living hell out of him, Gayle got pizzas in the storage room and drinks for everyone and let us take a few mins to go and eat if it wasn't crazy.

I should mention that I'm writing out the negative of two months of work, other than the older male I enjoyed everyone. The job is easy on pen and paper just mentally tasking and physically stressful when not granted human rights lol. But it was especially good because I never worked with Becky… yet.

When the Christmas season was over I was still attending Gayles music class and because I was so useful at Christmas I was rehired for Easter. Which was quite a short season. Easter was March 31 and we opened on the 1st with paid training on the 29th of feb (leap year I guess I had to double check that lol) Because it was a short season and we had more staff (excluding the older man however we had more people to fill his spot) I didn't think a lot of the shorter hours. One thing that Gayle warned me about was that we now had “secret shoppers” so just to make sure we were always nice with a smile etc. 

Easter was a lot slower than Christmas which was nice. Aubrey and I worked often together which made us close friends. We usually closed together and so I would help with bank slips and whatnot. On the first night me and Aubrey closed together. We couldn't figure out the cash clip and stayed an extra hour or so trying to solve it since you can't close without doing the bank every day. Mind you we do this clocked in, because we are still working and expect to be paid for it. 

With the short hours we didn't think much about it until I spoke to Lizzie (who is my buddy and we shared a Starbucks gift card during the season) a while later about how I thought my check would be a little bit bigger considering how long me and Aubrey were there that night. Lizzie is a smoker who could care less about what corporate or Becky say to her. Lizzie told me that they are scheduling us without breaks on purpose regardless of how much we worked we were only getting paid for what we were scheduled. She was pissed to say the least and she told me that she intended on talking to Becky about it later. This was new to me. We didn't change software, app, or anything so I didn’t understand why “the Program” was suddenly taking away the money I worked for just because I stayed later due to the work that MUST get done before all employees clock out. 

When me and Lizzie talked the next day she said that Becky had told her that she would get reimbursed 4 hours (which was fair) however Lizzie only took two because she said her smoke breaks would make it unreasonable. On March 7th me and Lizzie closed together, it was a slower day and the second Lizzie went to the storage room for something I had a woman come up to me and ask me how much our products cost, again we are apparently not supposed to tell people how much they cost we just have to tell them “it's an Experience!” But I swore I knew her so just as I’m explaining it to her I felt like I was talking slowly and so halfway through what I was saying I just made a joke about how I guess I'm spacey today. Mind you I'm not a bad worker and I don't go around telling customers how I'm not in the right headspace to be employed. I made a joke, because I felt like I was talking slowly while this woman STARED into my damn soul like literally imagine the movie Smile. Just when I'm about to continue she looks at me and in the most horror movie way you can imagine drops her smile and monotonically says.

“Wrong Answer.”

I look at her and I'm just like “Pardon?” and she looks at me and starts smiling AGAIN. And just goes, “Hi! I’m your regional manager!” like fml so my joke doesn't land and it was the girl I've been facelessly kissing up to since I started.

 She tells me that I didn't say any of that right and that she has been WATCHING ME and waiting until Lizzie walked away so she could “test” me because “Lizzie knows what she looks like” when Lizzie comes back they are just catching up while im having a silent panic attack trying to smile a passerbyers like im not on the verge of tears. 

Me and Lizzie have to take a customer so she steps away and goes on the mall sofas near us and just intimidates us the whole time??? We would be doing our job and look over at her and she's just glaring at us and then will text something on her phone and glare at us again. And repeat the process.

While we are getting closer to closing time a man walks into our photo opt with his phone out and so I just give him a little heads up that we can't allow personal photography. He looks at me like I'm a monster and says “Can I record if I give you guys $20 tips each?” I literally legally can't allow it, it is a copyrighted set. So I tell him “no sorry” but he repeats the same thing over and over again so I just try to explain it with more context and Becky who thinks she is above all goes, “Sure! Go ahead and take that video just as long as you buy the package!” and me and Lizzie just look at each other like               :o                                                                                              because nothing I say is right, but she can break corporate and copyright rules?? If she had taken the tip I would've walked out right there but thank god that man didn't actually even try to tip any of us, right? Oh and the best part, he starts venting to Becky about how I just didn't even listen or hear him out and she was just smiling and nodding. 

During the entire time we spoke to her she was telling us off for things that weren’t our fault. Our Easter bunny mascot had a little prop house they could sit in and drink water and take off their mask, they also had neck fans that were plugged in there because we have \*few working outlets around us.\* (import info) She instructed us that the security camera didn’t like how often they stepped off to drink water and told us to purchase long straws and feed it through instead. With our own money, there’s no company card or expense report. Lizzie looked at me and had a face of ‘just go with it she’s crazy’. This is bizarre considering that the shack had their water in it, they could take off their mask for a second, and their neck fans charged in there. We had three neck fans and only one worked perfectly, another one had a battery life of maybe half an hour, and the other one was okay for one shift… and one shift only because it would die if it was plugged in too long.

At one point Lizzie looked at Becky and just said. “I can’t follow the don’t tell the price rule, it’s insulting customers intelligence and leading to people getting mad at us.” Becky then goes into some bs statistics that she heard from her meetings and was just kissing up to the higher up’s while treating us while were stupid. As if god planned it a woman comes up and asks me what our price is, Becky looks at me and does voila hands to show them how it’s done. So I do, I follow her stupid script and I do exactly what she told me to. Wanna know what happens? The woman walks away before I finish my sentence. Me and Lizzie look at Becky like “see? Your rules are stupid” and she just said something stupid like “Not all of them can be winners. It usually works I promise” and I’m about to finally stand up for myself when Lizzie, the angel she is chimes in with, “No it doesn’t, this is how it works and we have lost more customers than we have gained.” And so then Becky goes, “wanna know what you can do instead then?” We’re like “yeah?” This woman actually says “You can tell them when they have asked twice!” Nothing more was said about that I can recall but just as my phone alarm went off to start closing (I use it in case of busy days so I can let my ride know if I’m going to be late) Becky just leaves. She won’t help; she was there to critique and cause problems and leave. Which is funny because I thought she had a job? So why was she there that day, especially since she’s from California, so she just drove the 5 hours to be a douchebag and then leave? Is that what she gets paid for?

It was obvious that Becky had never really worked this job and just shot up to her year round position, because she was unreasonable. The next day I was off, but the day after I went to work with Gayle. She was already there when I arrived and working and she joked with me about how much Becky tattled on me to her. She looked at me and just went 

“Oh I’m so sorry I need to tell you this, but you can’t wear this shirt anymore.”

I was confused because the dress code was a white long sleeved collared button up and that’s what I was wearing. It wasn’t so much a proper blouse, it was more of a sweater, but I had just bought it because I needed it specifically for work. My dad has the same job as Becky just in a different field and he said that as a boss my shirt would easily be allowed. Especially since I work at a mall where they keep it at like 60F year round and it’s cold when you stand all day, and we are not allowed to wear a jacket because that will obstruct our uniform. I am not someone who will point out others flaws or clothes to make her look better, but… Becky was wearing at least 4 coats with a Gucci bag when she went to see us. As far as I know, that's not the dress code. 

Another employee I worked with wore the assigned dress shirt, but it was sheer, she wore a tank top underneath but still? I’m wearing something completely appropriate and it’s helping me not freeze at work and I get in trouble. When I told my dad this he looked at me and while trying not to get frustrated he just said “I’m gonna bet it’s the fabric… that’s the only thing I can think of.” But if she can’t have the shirt be a cotton polyester blend I’ve got bad news for her.

I know it’s weird to vent about me apparently not wearing the right shirt but my mom (psychology major) mentioned that she thinks Becky was never upset about the sweater, but instead the fact that she’s not a 17 year old girl wearing it. I’m sorry to sound so “teenagery” but I am nothing but professional and “one of the best employees” (Gayle’s words) Aubrey, Gayle’s daughter, didn’t fill out her paperwork for Easter until I did because she didn’t want to work without me. Lizzie also requested to work with me instead of anyone else, I don’t want to sound like an ungrateful kid but I work hard and all of this just for a job during Christmas and Easter and treating it like I’m working at Chanel or something is just annoying. I get told year round by Becky through Gayle, about how good I am, but she has a problem with everything I say and do and now, wear? 

It may not mean much on the internet but that day genuinely gave me so much stress I was in terrible condition. I was having dreams where I would be working a busy day and Becky would be watching me from the balcony. I had sleep paralysis of me and Aubrey at the register and I would be falling asleep at the register and Aubrey would be shaking me awake over and over again. This lasted for about a week and half.

March 10th a day after Gayle told me about the shirt incident, I had such a vivid dream of terrible things happening to the mall that I called out. Turns out it was fever induced and got sick anyways so it wasn’t dishonest of me calling sick. Working with both children and older people was something I didn’t want to do while sick so I called out March 10-13. But I picked up extra shifts after to make up for it.

On the 31st we closed and me and Gayle stayed at the mall until after midnight packing up hundreds of boxes from both Easter and Christmas and putting shipping labels on them, which was so physically tasking. I did this all on a pretty much empty stomach. I got payed for it, however because we were double checking stuff after we told Becky our hours \*(she can put the time we clock in and out 🚩)\* We didn't get paid for about 20 min of us just double checking our boxes before we left. Which honestly I was too tired to care about and there is no service in the back rooms so calling Becky was hard to do. 

Oh and did I mention that for this being such a prestigious and super strict company we didn’t even have proper first aid? Not a bandaid in sight. Working with a lot of paper and cardboard/boxcutters you get cut a lot and some used paper towels while I had the luxury of using receipt paper and tape.

Now to the current time, I have been writing this for about 2 days now and I start work tomorrow. I’ve been dreading it and don’t worry I’m planning on getting a regular job after this season. But we already have problems with Becky and other than text confirmations I haven't even spoken to her. 

Y’know that physically tasking job of the boxes? Becky asked Gayle and one assistant, either me or Aubrey because Lizzie isn’t coming back this season (good lord save me) to help her with it. I have nerve pain in my spine and have been helping my sister move into her apartment which doesn’t help. While Gayle needs a hip replacement surgery. And we did all the boxes again, except we moved them into the storage room. Luckily Aubrey stopped by for about an hour with some drinks for us and helped us count. While Becky told us to fire up the system and do some test products. We have no working outlets in our storage room and no wifi in our back room. So we had to move our computer register system, two printers, two laptops, whole camera setup with flash and tripod, and every goddamn cord. Oh and it was me and Gayle carrying the table of ALL of that between the rooms. 

Nothing was working because… shocker, no internet. So we went to the storage room and Gayle called Becky who immediately just told us “Well it’s not the internet I can tell you that much,” no hello just straight to talking to Gayle like she was ordering a dog around, which pissed me off but I bit my tongue. We ran everything around again and went back to calling Becky who again told us exactly what she didn’t know. So we finally called tech support who was confused as to why we were even testing the equipment that day. He fixed the problem but told us that it was kinda useless because they hadn’t even decided on our seasonal design for the year. Because of that, most of our systems weren’t updated, he said it was fine that we were doing our inventory and it’s good that we tried but it was pretty much useless.

 Gayle just started laughing out of exhaustion and tech support fixed our problem. It was the internet, y’know what Becky “knew” it wasn’t. Because she wasn’t there and was sitting in her car the whole time, while we busted our butts doing something that we were told was pretty much a waste of time. We took our sample and sent a picture to Becky and Gayle called her to say how long we all had worked and been there. I arrived half an hour before Gayle and walked around a bit before starting but we worked the same amount of time. Even without having internet I can see the time I sent texts and used that to help us figure out how long we had been there. I texted my parents at 11:30 am on the dot that I was losing service and that I would text them when I needed to get picked up. Without service I would still try to send update texts and I sent my last text at 3:29 pm (yes I have screenshots and almost everything saved) but That is 4 hours pretty much on the dot that we worked. And because Becky is on speaker this is what I hear

Gayle, “me and x arrived at 11:30 and it’s 3:30 so that’s 4 hours for us, and Aubrey came in for just over an hour.”

Becky, “alright so you get 4 hours and I’ll give X and Aubrey 2 hours each.”

Gayle “okay! Wait. No, she worked 4 hours with me, she actually even arrived before me.”

Becky,” No I told you 2 hours max that’s all she gets.”

Literally verbatim. Gayle then whispered to me that she’ll figure it out and pay me for the rest I did. I got my deposit a week after, two hours worked, so I texted Gayle. Only problem is Gayle, as much as I love her, is a little bit of a space cadet. I’m worried that she has already forgotten and not only am I but also everyone around pissed. My dad who has been a boss for a long time is upset with her, and my mom dreads Becky and has started having dreams where she curses her out. My sister's fiancé works closely with the labor board and so I’m trying to get some sort of script I can use if Becky tries to pull more bleep like this again. 

oh, and I’m getting my damn two hours, I don’t care if that’s not even a lot I earned it… not her. 

At the moment I am currently using an app on my phone called Lognote to mark every violation, the two hours unpaid, and I am going to start marking exactly what time I clock in and out and matching it to my work app to make sure Becky doesn’t change my hours to not give me my proper pay. I keep telling myself that I will be the sweetest nightmare of an employee if this season continues the way it started, especially because I am now an assistant manager instead of Lizzie and I’m Gayle’s “right arm” as much as I love Gayle and Aubrey if anything goes wrong it’s going to be everyone’s problems. I wish I would’ve done this last year so I’m doing it this year. I would really appreciate any more advice I can get, or any extra information about anything that I mentioned.",1,1731064155.0,u_InTheKlerbWeAllFam,0,1.0,False

I was with this guy for 6 months, about 1 month ago we both went through some pretty heavy shit and his response was basically to disappear... he lives like 45 minutes away from me and I asked him to please come to where I lived because I felt like I needed taking care of, basically he said some bs excuse and didnt come, nor the day after. I got really mad and basically felt like the relationship had ended because that was a big deal imo. Fastforward to a couple of weeks ago, he asks to see me and says that he was ""going through it"" and couldnt face me, said that he was having a really rough time and thats why he wasnt present, asked me to forgive him and if we could please go to the way things were before. I didn't forgive him, he kept texting and calling me and I sometimes responded, also because I genuinely wanted to understand what was going through his fed up brain. Then I told him I wanted to stop talking to him. He kept texting and calling me and said he wouldnt stop until i forgave him for that week, he said he would do anything to get me back. He told me he booked a sushi restaurant for sunday where I live so we could see eachother and talk. Keeps texting, calling me and then yesterday he said he was gonna come to where I live when he got off work at 10 pm. I was busy so I didnt reply to any of his texts, then finally replied it wasn't a good idea because I was tired and gonna be in bed by that time. This morning he shows up at my work and brings coffee and briosches, rings the doorbell of my work, my colleague opens the door and he says ""I'm looking for (my name)"". I never even told him where I work so I have no idea how he got the address, he must have found it on the internet or something. Anyway I found showing up at my work while I am working extremely inappropriate and cringe and I have been stressed not being able to concentrate on my work since he did this. I dont understand his behaviour at all it is extremely erratic but is this harassment?

1gmft9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gmft9p,"Is anyone else surprised by how little they care about the F80? Never thought I'd be unphased by a flagship Ferrari! 👀 I wrote yesterday about timeless Ferrari design using this as my example, looks 8 years old at most, not nearly 20. ","I was left quite disappointed after the launch of the F80 recently, I never thought I'd have little to no interest in a flagship Ferrari! Going further I don't think I even care about the new ""holy Trinity"" lineup at all! 👀 They should be exciting or intimidating but instead they come across as soul-less bags of sensors and safety features. 

I needed to be reminded of Ferrari's ability to make timeless design and properly desirable cars. The Ferrari 599 is probably not the first car that comes to mind when you say timeless design but at the same time I don't think any of us would say that this car looks almost 20 years old and there's even fewer that would challenge the desirability of the 599! This was at the Limerick Cars and Coffee in August, let's get to the details. 

This is a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano (named for its total engine displacement 5,999 cc/6.0 L, Gran Turismo Berlinetta layout, and the Fiorano Circuit test track used by Ferrari) it has a V12 and produces 612bhp. This one is finished in the rarer Rosso Rubino which has a beautiful depth to it and seems like a triple coat candy red, really one to see in the flesh! It's sitting on a lovely set of silver 20'' Monolithic Alloy Wheels. 

Just wanted to share this with you all to remind you of the kind of car Ferrari can build when they haven't been smothered in regulations.

1gmfrpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gmfrpl/is_it_too_soon_to_think_about_divorce_over/,Is It Too Soon to Think About Divorce Over Household Imbalance?,"I am 26[F] married to 30[M] 

I’ve been married for 10 months now, and I’m struggling to find happiness. I live with my in-laws, who are genuinely loving and caring, and my husband, who loves me as well. Since moving in, I've been learning how to manage the home and handle chores. We do have househelp who assists with cleaning and dishwashing, so that part is covered.

Every morning, I make breakfast for my husband, get ready for work, and tidy up our room before leaving. Meanwhile, my husband wakes up, gets ready, eats the breakfast I prepared, and heads out. Most of the time, I’m the one who takes the laundry out for washing. When I ask him to help, I have to request it explicitly, which frustrates me because I feel like the burden of responsibility falls on me. On days I don’t feel like making his coffee, he’ll casually tell me that his dad will do it for him, which only adds to my frustration. The level of privilege he has—not even making his own coffee—is overwhelming.

If our cook is on leave, my MIL steps in to cook. On occasions when my husband and I cook together, I end up cleaning the mess afterward. When I cook by myself, I’m still the one cleaning up. After dinner, I’m the one clearing the table, rinsing dishes, and wiping down the kitchen. When I ask for his help, his response is often, “If you can’t do it, leave it—my mom will take care of it.” This mindset has led to many fights between us.

Recently, he started putting clean laundry in our closet, but only after persistent arguing, and I still have to fold it when the househelp isn’t around—because, according to him, he doesn’t know how. Communication has become difficult; he either gets defensive or tells me his parents will handle things for him. Before we got married, we discussed shared responsibilities at home, and he agreed—but I don’t see that happening.

I’m considering giving this marriage one more year. If things don’t change and he doesn’t step up to share responsibilities, I’m thinking of pursuing a divorce. I plan to continue fulfilling my duties as a daughter-in-law, but if I don’t see him maturing and taking responsibility, I’m prepared to leave. This decision worries me because I love him and my in-laws, but my beliefs and values just don’t align with theirs, and it’s taking a toll on me.

1gmfpga,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1gmfpga/back_in_the_office_and_everything_feels_pointless/,Back in the office and everything feels pointless. ,"So the bosses have made the call to get the team back in the office 5 days a week as it’ll be good for “collaboration” and “creative culture” and it’s quickly destroying me. 

I was willing to give it a good go and genuinely like most of the people in the team but wow, is it shit. I know it’s a common rant here but it’s kinda shocked me how useless the whole thing feels. 

An hour commute each way to sit in a dusty CBD office that has worse ergonomics, worse lighting, worse internet speeds, worse heating/cooling. Having to try and constantly tune out of others conversations - either from chatting on phone, with other colleagues or my favourite - people who just like to verbalize every client email they got to the team. Trying to balance getting work done between engaging in team chit chat to help build “culture” is exhausting again. I get less done and feel more wrecked for it. 

Everything is expensive: commute, coffee, lunch and any social drinks if on offer is a decent pay cut. I feel like I need to buy a new wardrobe again. Shit I forgot caring about a long time ago

I get home more exhausted than usual and so is my wife as now she has to do the school drop offs I used to share, the dog walks I used to do at lunch and general house keeping stuff that piles up, that could be chipped away between meetings or straight after work hours. Hell, I even used to not mind working after hours when WFH because I felt more engaged and less exhausted and was happy to chip away at interesting work when it felt right. Now I consciously spend night thinking about what I need to prepare for the next day. Dumb shit like what I need to take in. What clothes are washed, ironed ready for the day. 

So currently really feeling there’s not a single benefit to being back in the office. For me or for the business. And because I’m helping setting up a lot of the infrastructure for the office, I see first hand how fucking expensive it is for the business to have a physical, functional space. Money they could save and focus on profits. 

I just can’t see the benefits more than a day or so to come together for those really important in person meetings or collaboration sessions. 

Has anyone gone through this transition and learned to love the office again? It’s making me brain dead. ",122,1731062560.0,auscorp,39,0.96,False

Need some last minute advice on specific things. ,"Hello everyone. My wife and I are visiting Bosnia for the first time. We have a rental car so transport is not an issue. We are here for a week and staying in old town as it is easy walk to most things in the city. Four of days our trip will be for exploring. 3 days for Sarajevo itself. I would appreciate it if you can offer some advice on some issues. 

1. A day for Lake Jablanica area, Mostar and Blagaj Tekke. A day for Sutjeska national park. A day for Vlasic and Jajce. A day for Bijambare. Is this a sensible plan? If there is anything not worth travelling for on my list then I can split up day 1 so I can do Mostar/Blagaj Tekke one day and lake Jablanica area another day. 

2. Sutjeska national park. I assume this is a very large area. Are there any particularly spots that you would recommend or perhaps some nice hiking trails?

3. I hear land mines may be an issue. We intend to stick to established footpaths and will not be going off the main areas. Are there any other precautions to take?

4. Is Vlasic accessible at this time of the year? Can Vlasic be done together with Jajce as a day trip?

5. Are there any other nature/beautiful sites around Sarajevo (within 3 hours drive)?

6. For food I am going to make sure to try Bosnian coffee, cevapi and borek. A friend has said we must try  tufahije. Are there any other local foods that we must try? 

7. It is not important for me but the other half loves upscale and nice restaurants. I would be grateful if you can recommend 1 or 2 in Sarajeveo. We eat halal. 

8. What do Bosnian people have for breakfast as we would like to do the same? Do places open early in Sarajevo for breakfast?

Friends look up to you and seek your advice. You're supposed to dress and act a certain way—prude, innocent, pious, and pure.

But deep down, there's a wild side of you that's been repressed—collared, chained, and caged by the expectations and norms you were raised with. This inner conflict drives you crazy because of the hypocrisy you see.

You can't let this side of you out due to a fear of judgment or vulnerability.

You have a choice: stay in your current role, which is fine, or unleash yourself.

I'm here to help you explore those urges discreetly and without judgment. This might be your chance to let loose and be as daring as you want. When we’re done, you can return to your normal life with a secret grin that no one needs to understand—until you want to do it again.

Here's a general idea about me: 5'7"", moreno with a dad bod (yeah, yeah I'm working on it and working out), I look young for my age with a cool and hip personality. From one of the top 4 (Blue if it matters). During the day, I am a suit/barong wearing, coffee drinking motivational speaker and life coach. At night, the work clothes come off and I am equally comfy with jeans/shots, plain tees and a light beer.

1gmfms8,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1gmfms8/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1gmfh3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1gmfh3i/manifest_being_where_you_want_to_be_physically/,Manifest Being Where You Want To Be Physically With Neville Goddard,"It was 1933. If you remember, there was a frightful Depression on in our country. Millions were unemployed (*The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression between 1929 and 1939 that began after a major fall in stock prices in the United States*.)

In New York City, you would go through the tunnel into Gimbel’s  from, say, the square, where Gimbel’s begins… it goes all the way through to the… well, the Holland Tunnel. 

They were sleeping with the permission of the Mayor… three and four deep, as far as the eye could go. There was no place to go. In the park, in the summer months, they were allowed to sleep in the park, sleep all over the place. And the long lines for coffee and bread were there to give them.

There were millions unemployed. We then had a population of not more than, say, a hundred thirty million, as against today’s a hundred ninety two million.

I was a dancer, and if you couldn’t eat, you couldn’t pay to watch a dancer, so there were no shows playing on Broadway. I think we had five Broadway shows, and they were running on paper… just.. passing out paper to go and see them, really, instead of the usual 50 to 60 shows that you usually get.

Well, what I’m getting at is, I didn’t have a job, I had no money, and I was living in a basement on 75th Street and he *(Abdullah)* lived on 72nd Street, in a very lovely home that was owned by Morgenthau, whose son was then the treasury of our country, a cabinet member *(US Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt)*, but his father owned this house, but he didn’t live there, and he rented the first floor to my friend Abdullah.

I said to Abdullah, in the month of October, late October, “*Ab, you know I’ve been gone from Barbados for almost twelve years… I came here in ’22. And it’s almost 12 years, and I’ve never had a desire to go back. But now I have a hungry desire, a haunting desire, to go to Barbados. Not a thing stops me but a lack of money. I have no money*.”

He said to me, “*You are in Barbados*.”

I said, “*I am in Barbados*?”

He said, “*Yes. You are now in Barbados. And so… you see Barbados, and you see America from Barbados, and you can smell the tropical land of Barbados, see only the little homes of Barbados, and that’s all you do. You just simply sleep this night in Barbados*.”

Well, I thought him insane, really… I mean, at the moment, it seemed so… stupid. Because… 72nd Street, we still had 50- and 60-story buildings. And little Barbados with a little three-story building almost the tallest that you’d find. And narrow little streets and no sidewalks. And I’m walking on a sidewalk that is wider than the widest street in Barbados on 72nd Street.

Well, nevertheless, that night I slept in Barbados. I assumed that I’m in Barbados in my mother’s home, and that I saw America relative to Barbados, and it wasn’t under me that night… it was north of me, about two thousand miles.

Well, the next day, I didn’t tell him anything… about a week later when nothing happened, I thought I would approach him. This time we’ve moved into November.

I said, “*You know, Ab, there’s no… not a thing has happened*.”

He wouldn’t discuss it with me. He turned his back on me and went into his little library and slammed the door.

About three times I tried to open up the discussion with my friend Ab between that moment when I first talked to him and the end.

He would never discuss it, on the basis: “*How could he discuss with me how I am going to Barbados when I am already in Barbados?” That’s stupid to discuss how I’m going to go when I am in Barbados! And if I am faithful to my assumption, I can’t discuss the “how. I’m already there*!”

Well, this went on… on the morning of the fourth day of December… there’s no job, no place to go… and the last boat that will get me there by Christmas is going to sail on the sixth.

Under my door is a little letter from my brother Victor. And he said, “*As a family we were never around the table at Christmas together. That Cecil*”– he’s my oldest brother… he left home before the last was born, because we have a large family; there’s eight years between my sister Daphne, who was the eighth child, and then my brother Joe.

Well, in that interval, my brother Cecil went off to Demerara. So… never as a family were we ever together at Christmas.

So in the letter, he justifies why he’s asked me to come. “*I know you don’t have a job, and there’s no excuse for not coming. And so I’m enclosing a draft for fifty dollars… you may need a shirt, a pair of shoes, socks or something, and I’ve notified the Furness Withy Line that you’ll come for a ticket. So the ticket is waiting for you at the Furness Line*.”

Well, I was so excited… I rushed on down to the Furness Line and I told – gave them my letter. They said, “*Yes, we have a message here from your family in Barbados. We’ll give you a ticket, but we haven’t any First Class tickets left. You can go Third Class, and use the facilities of the First. But you have to sleep Third Class, until you hit the island of St. Thomas. When you hit St. Thomas, someone disembarks, then you may take a First Class bunk*.”

I said, “*I’ll take it*.”

I rushed right up to Abdullah, and I said, “*Ab, I got my ticket for Barbados, but I have to go Third Class*.” *I’m all elated and happy about it*.”

He said, “*Who told you that you are going to Barbados? And who told you that you went to Barbados Third Class? You went to Barbados, and you went First Class*.”

Would say no more.

He isn’t even happy that I’m going to Barbados now. (*audience laughing*)

So I went down on the morning of the sixth day of December, with my Third Class ticket. Went up to the desk as they’re checking in the passengers, and I put my ticket forward, and they said “*I’ve got good news for you, Mr. Goddard. Someone has cancelled, and you’re going First Class*.”

And I went First Class all the way down to Barbados. Ten days down; ten days back, with three heavenly months in Barbados.

So all that I did… I tried to the best of my ability to with his almost insolence… he was rude. But he taught me by his rudeness that I cannot discuss how if I am doing what I’m supposed to do.

He tells me right away, “*You are in Barbados*.” Like someone comes to you now, and you would apply this principle toward their request, and they say, “*Oh, I would love to be happily married*.” And you say to her, or him, “*You are now happily married.*” They look at you as though you’re insane.

But that’s exactly what you’re supposed to do. “*You are now happily married*.” Well, if I am now happily married and I’m a lady, I would instantly begin to feel that ring there in my imagination. And I’d let others see that I have my ring– well, that would imply I’m happily married, a wedding ring… and so if I don’t wear it from then on, I’m not doing what I’m supposed to do.

So in my imagination, I have to go to bed wearing my ring, and actually do all that I would do in that state.

Oh, he said, “Y*ou’re in Barbados*.” And I’m in New York City physically, but he put me in Barbados in my imagination. So that I slept in Barbados to the best of my ability. But you know days go into weeks, and the weeks went into a month, and I’m trying my best to open the discussion with him, to get a little hope. No, no hope! 

He wouldn’t give me any encouragement if I did what he told me to do. Well, we all are human enough to want another little discussion, another little push. And so he taught me the lesson that there is no such thing as “a little pregnancy.” No such thing. If you did it, then you’re pregnant. Let the child grow. And interference with it is going to be a miscarriage.

“*You assume that you are in Barbados*.” Now you are pregnant. The idea is that you are going to give birth to a journey which will land you right in Barbados. So you’ve assumed it. That is conception. Now, don’t try to argue. You have conceived. And all you have to do is be a faithful mother, and bear that child, and don’t discuss it with me anymore.

He never discussed it, after he told me I was in Barbados.

I'm publishing a small app for my local customers. The app is quite specific, a keeper (wallet) for passes on Android (like wallet on iOS, but only for passes, no cards).

Please join the group, install it and.. there is not quite a lot of things to do without passes, so it would be nice if you just open menu, select second option and send any random feedback just in case.

Will test u back!
