1prhyg3,https://i.redd.it/acv7cu9mvd8g1.jpeg,Deer tallow rendering,"So we have been rendering fat from our deer to make soap and lotion. I have been straining it through various cheesecloths, then, juice strainer filters from Blaine's farm and fleet which seems to have a tighter weave fabric, but still it takes several renderings to get the fat clear and I still see some very slight colors at the bottom of my containers I transfer the fat into once I simmer all the water out. I'm done rendering 5-6-7 times though the same ole fabric filters (even doubling up the filters to try and filter it better) it's beginning to waste my time. There has to be a better filter. So I looked into what size mesh typical cheese cloth and fabric juice filters are that I've been using and I believe them to be somewhere between 50- 100 (at best) size mesh. And obviously they're fabric, so as I hand wash them between renders over and over, the fibers of these filters have to be slowly degrading and opening up just like an old shirt that's been washed a hundred times. So I found these stainless steel mesh filters on Amazon with a wide range of mesh levels from 20 all the way on up to 2800 mesh (which I'm thinking is damn near airtight lol) and being stainless they would be much more durable and last much longer. So, do any of you possibly know what size mesh would be preferable for fat rending while still being tight enough to pour liquid hot fat though and strain out all impurities and solids, while at the same time not overkill and being so tight of a mesh that the fat barely drips though and takes all day long. I'm saying this because I've also tried to use a standard coffee filter which Google tells me could be anywhere from 300-600 mesh, and the fat barely dripped though. It was so inefficient I had to spoon it over the filters with a rubber band holding them atop of a bunch of mason jars. Seemed to get it clean, but took so long the fat actually hardened back up and I had to put the whole contraption inside a large pot with a lid on and some water on low heat to get the fat to stay hot enough to leak though the filter. Also was excruciatingly slow. If anyone has some insight as to what mesh level performs best for cleaning fat micro solids, and still being efficient enough to at least ladel the liquid fat though, let me know.

1prhyfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurCanada/comments/1prhyfo/seeking_business_partner_with_previous/,Seeking business partner with previous advertising sales experience. Offering 50-50 ownership. I will finance the business. Your time and sales efforts are what is required..,"Prior to the pandemic I operated a very successful and growing one page in publication called [Pot Leaf News](https://www.instagram.com/potleafnews/) which is similar in structure to Coffee news. As a business model it focusses on hyper local distribution of a one page, monthly publication catered to the alternative community, and the selling of year long, inexpensive monthly coupon placements.

You find the free host locations. At the same time you sell the paper out.   


The business is incredibly minimal, neat and tidy, and is designed to operate with low upkeep, while allowing a focus on scaling to new markets, by simply replicating the same plan personally, or by finding additional 50-50 partners. In which case you and I would split proceeds 25-25 and the operating partner would keep 50% for themselves. This allows for rapid scaling and passive income generation. 

Prior to the pandemic we were operating in six Canadian cities and seven US ones. Unfortunately all business had to stop, as going out to small businesses entirely stopped. 

I still have 2500 branded rack stands, each market is approximately 50 distribution points in a hyper local area, so this allows for very strong scaling, before re-order is necessary.

I already have four full years of completely produced monthly iterations. The one page editions remain consistent, across all markets, only the advertisement placement change.

Specifically there are 26 available business card sized advertisement spaces, which we sell on average for $100-$200 a month, depending on the market. We put clients on automatic payment each month.

Coming out to less than three dollars a day for very good advertising value. Where they narrow cast, as opposed to broadcast. This is an easy sales effort, and they get direct feedback in the form of people coming in with the coupons. 

This makes the clients stay.  We also offer exclusivity for their business category, for example only one tattoo parlour would be allowed to advertise in a specific edition. All of this is designed to Lock in advertisers with low-cost yearly contracts.

Cost to produce each edition is under $300 including distribution. So a completely sold out Edition produces $2200 a month in profit which we are splitting. Even a partially sold edition is still profitable.

All advertisement design and placement is outsourced inexpensively and managed by the way of a single email in which all advertisement design requests or placements are sent. We offer simple free placement and design for the clients. These costs are paid by the proceeds from each edition, and fall well with under the $300 a month cost average. 

My longtime friend, and business partner Coleman Younger died at 40 years old during the pandemic after complications from vaccination. It is only now that the economy, society and alternative business sector has healed enough for this to resume.

What is required from your participation is sweat equity and dedication. I will finance and provide professional quality resources, so that all you have to do is focus on the sales and acquisition of hosts. 

If you go to a tattoo parlour and you ask …hey can I put a one page fun, educational, magazine about marijuana in your store every month for your customers to read? That same tattoo parlour is highly likely to also place a $100 monthly advertisement, as they understand that you will be putting this newsletter in 50 local businesses, that are aligned with their Target market. Skate shop, cannabis dispensary, vegan restaurant etc. etc.

I will handle all payment processing. I will handle all graphic design requirements. The production of all newsletter editions. The provision of branded rack stands, and the administration of all distribution requirements, and Post sale client management. All that you will be doing is selling, and finding new markets to open the next one. 

If you are the right person and we make an agreement. I will give you 50% of the shares in the incorporated business. Additionally, I will split all net proceeds with you after costs 50-50 each month, as outlined.

It is entirely possible to structure this business to operate in as many markets Coffee news which is currently over 1000 locations worldwide. Even with modest saturation, with one edition in every major US and Canadian city for example. It will be possible to generate upwards of $10,000, to $100,000 a month of passive income quickly. In the last month before the pandemic I split $13,000 of sales revenue with my partner.  

At a future point, we will also likely consider a sale of the business. Or if it's working really really well… we might just keep it in perpetuity and pass it down. Either way. We are building two value pillars. The passive monthly income. As well as the overall value of the Company.

The only risk associated with you pursuing this business venture is your time. I will not require any Financial investment from you at any juncture. I am in a position to scale the business financially, and administratively as we go.

I have a good track record in business and I'm happy to provide references, as well as my LinkedIn. I have successfully built and sold three businesses, each of which achieved a multimillion dollar valuation, starting in 2014.

If this sounds like something you could be interested in. …And really willing to throw yourself heavily into. Message me...

 yours,

1prhxmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1prhxmy/need_advice_dating/,Need Advice - Dating,"HI 👋 I’m INFJ 5w6 (M) and recently met a soft-spoken lady at a church group lunch for young people. I’ve seen her around a few times before that day, was curious about her, but never approached her.

At the lunch, there was a guy who was all over her and think she was a bit irritated about it, as she kept rolling her eyes about the comments and attention she was getting from him. 

I learnt later at lunch a few people - including her were taking mbti tests. By this point, she’d learnt I was an INFJ, while listening in on a conversation I’d been having with another lady who’d engaged me for most of the time. The other guy eased off, so I got a chance to speak to her, asked what her mbti was, and she said the test was taking too long so she quit it.

Then a moment came at the lunch where most people got to know I was a single Dad and learnt my age, and this for some reason caught her attention. When there was a moment of quiet, she said she thought I was a student, and surprised about my age. And that got us talking briefly, learning each other’s names, where she’s from and what’s she’s currently doing - she’s a postgrad student.

I gave her and her friends a ride back to their neighbourhood, cos it was on the route to my friend’s place. The following week, I made an effort to follow up with her and I noticed she was warm, more eye contact and staying in the conversation. I was working on setting things down that day but asked if she had plans to grab a meal with a group afterwards, and she just intended to walk around the town centre. I mentioned we could grab a bite together if she was still around when I was done and she said ok. Said bye to go work on setting down and turned round to notice a lingering look from her, I waved & smiled then moved on. I noticed she left later than usual that day but I was still working when she decided to leave.

The following Sunday, my daughter was in church with me. I noticed my new lady friend sat on the same row. My daughter kept me busy so I never got the chance to notice if she’d seen us or say hi until service ended. Once it did, I noticed my friend grabbed her bag/jacket, moving progressively, then dropped them right beside mine. So I returned to my seat area, and started chatting with her and her friends. 

One thing I notice when I’m talking with her - I feel calm, safe, grounded and authentic. She’s mostly quiet in groups at church, or even talking to other people. But she seems to be a bit more animated & come alive when we talk. She was surprised I remember most of the things I learned about her from previous conversations.

It was getting a bit challenging to keep up small talk on a weekly basis, so I asked to exchange numbers so we could meet sometime outside church for coffee and know each other better. First question she asked: your wife? I clarified I was no longer married, so she decided to exchange numbers.

What does her actions and body language indicate? Is she available and open to exploring a connection with me? Or is she just being polite?

So far, I’ve tried to stay measured and be authentic when I’m interacting with her, but it’s been ages since I dated so hoping I’m approaching this the right way.

I just recovered emotionally from a toxic marriage and trying to build something healthy/long-term intentionally this time.

My plan is just grab coffee at a cafe, talk a bit then head off to an art gallery of museum of illusions nearby for the 1st time we meet, for opportunities to learn about each other and also have interesting things to chat about.",1,1766247097.0,infj,0,1.0,False

I have been suffering from background anxiety, racing thoughts, obsessive repeating thoughts for years. All were quite manageable up to a point. 

i enjoy drinking alcohol A LOT. It is the most consumed stuff where I live and I fancy it. 

Well, about 1.5 years ago, I drank with some friends on my birthday (heavily) and the next morning I woke up with my first and only ever full blown intense panic attack. i thought I was dying. That episode absolutely fucked me up permanently ever since. I am a very informed person in general and during the panic attack, one of the thoughts was ""am in alcohol withdrawal ?"". Ever since, my mind is almost everyday switched on with repetitive and tiring obsessive thoughts like : ""alcohol"", ""withdrawal"" , ""come on have a drink you need it"" and stuff like this. I don't actively crave alcohol, I don't ""need"" it, my brain is jester. Also, my background anxiety worsened. 

I did CBT therapy for 16 weeks and it helped me tremendously, for some time. However, everything was temporary. over the time I was more and more overwhelmed. 

You may tell me ""quit drinking"". Well, agree with you, however I did that several times, for weeks or months, thinking my alcohol days are over. However, no positive effect whatsoever, I felt the same each time, even with a restful sleep program, good diet. Only thing helping me is magnesium glycinate, glycine, taurine. 

in the past months I have started feeling worse and worse, quit drinking for one month and nothing at all, so I decided to go to a psychiatrist. 

After several tests and visits to a clinical psychologist, I have been diagnosed with combined ADHD and severe GAD. 

My psychiatrist prescribed me Zoloft as it is the best for this. He didn't prescribe me ADHD meds because that would blow my anxiety out. I am very scared to start this kind of medication due to the side effects, emotional numbing, lowered libido, potential withdrawals etc...

Should I be scared ? Maybe some other alternatives ? 

I was thinking to force myself in the upcoming January, quit alcohol, quit coffee, build a tighter schedule regarding sleep, dieting, take more magnesium, meditate etc.. and then see if I want to start medication. 

So, what do you think ? Thank you all. ",1,1766246897.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

(English isn't my first language) We met this past summer at an anime event, he doesn't have many friends, I give him little life tips regarding studies, how to talk to girls, we discuss different anime etc. So he has wanted to learn swimming, he asked me if I could teach him swim at the local pool, I'm a good swimmer personally and don't mind helping out my friend for free since class is too pricy for a student, yesterday we met up, I showed him a few strokes and then we grabbed some coffee. I am just honest and told my fiancé how my day went when he came back from work, he really flipped out, was saying inappropriate things that upset me and I made me cry, one of them is that my friend is trying to get laid with me, he is taking advantage of me for free swimming lesson, he just wanted to see me in a bathing suit. And that I shouldn't be friends with males, especially a boy so young. I got so pissed off and told him to get out of my house, opened the front door and told him to leave now. He called me a B word and left. It's been almost a  day and he still haven't messaged me and at this point I am crying my eyes out and thinking about breaking off the engagement.

I can handle that to be honest but I cant shake the feeling of being single. I hate it. I lay in my bed crying sometimes of how lonely it feels to be single. I try to distract myself with working out and hanging out with guy friends. 

The thing is that all my guy friends are getting married lol. I have two friend groups and I am the only single one of the group. Its kinda crazy. So i have a bunch of weddings lined up for 2026. 

I dont want to get desperate and start asking random girls out. 

For example, I go to this one ramen restaurant every weekend. Most of the workers are women. I stopped going for a month because of school. I come back and the workers remember me and they give me free drinks worth $40. And they also give me discounts lol. Same thing happens at this coffee shop I go to where the workers always get free orders. 

 Maybe I should ask a waitress lol. (this is a joke btw). But my mind is all over the place. I also feel like I should blow up my female associate phone just because I am bored and lonely. 

I feeling that type of way. How do you get over that before I do something stupid.

I used that time to work on myself, try new things, stay busy, and also sit with my thoughts when needed.

Not sure if it’s the holiday blues, but lately I’ve been missing the small, everyday stuff. Sending random updates about my day, turning errands into low-key dates, or having someone to greet at 12 midnight on December 25 aside from my family.

It’s not a dramatic kind of loneliness, just something that pops up every now and then. And while it kind of sucks, I think I’m ready to do something about it.

- Has his own interests, hobbies, and friendships

I see posts asking how to take the leap into filmmaking so I wanted to share my experience making my first short:

I was looking for film community in LA and found Secret Movie Club, a small theater that held a monthly “open mic short night” where they screened shorts made from that month’s theme.  
  
December’s theme? “Holiday and New Year.” Go figure.  
  
Because, at 28, I had zero film experience, I wrote a story completely contained in dialogue. It was about two exes meeting at a diner on Christmas.  
  
I asked Julie, the barista at my local coffee shop, and Reid, who I met at SMC, if they would act in it for free and they said yes.  
  
I called twenty or thirty diners in LA and they all said no, or yes..for a lot of money.  
  
Finally, a man in San Diego said he was happy to let me film in his diner for four hours after close for $150.  
  
A friend gave me the number of a wedding photographer named David. I called and asked him if he’d help and he said yes and that he had a BMPCC4k, which he explained was a camera.  
  
I found someone on Craigslist who could do sound and rented the equipment for $50.  
  
After a couple rehearsals, we all drove to San Diego together and made the short and watched it play at SMC later that month.  
  
Anyway, did that all bore you to death?

Don’t Overlook Restrooms (It Matters More Than You Think),"If you’ve planned anything around SXSW before, you already know the basics are harder: crowds are bigger, timelines shift, and small oversights turn into big problems fast.

One thing that consistently gets underestimated? **Restrooms.**

A few SXSW-specific reasons why restroom planning deserves extra attention:

**1. Foot Traffic Is Higher Than You Expect**  
Even invite-only events end up with more use than planned. Badge holders, staff, performers, vendors**,** usage adds up quickly, especially over long days.

**2. Many SXSW Venues Aren’t Built for Volume**  
Pop-ups, parking-lot activations, backyard showcases, and converted spaces often don’t have permanent restrooms sized for SXSW crowds. Lines form fast.

**3. Guest Experience Is Everything**  
For brand events, artist showcases, and sponsored activations, perception matters. Clean, well-lit, climate-controlled restrooms quietly support the experience, and prevent negative feedback.

**4. Weather + Walking = Higher Demand**  
SXSW means lots of walking, hydration, coffee, and beer. That combination increases restroom use whether the event is daytime, nighttime, or both.

**5. Comfort Keeps People Longer**  
When restrooms are easy, clean, and comfortable, guests stay longer, which matters for brand activations, showcases, and media-driven events.

I help run **Loo Crew Rentals**, and we’ve supported **SXSW events around Austin for several years,** everything from backyard showcases to brand pop-ups. One thing we see every year is that restroom planning is rarely top-of-mind until it becomes a problem.

Luxury restroom trailers tend to blend in better than people expect and solve multiple issues at once: capacity, cleanliness, lighting, and climate control.

SXSW events are complex enough already, restrooms are one of those things that should just *work* in the background.

I'm a type 1 diabetic. Have been since I was 11. I'm 28 now. My sister is 32 and she's been a nurse for six years. She's always had this thing where she thinks I'm dramatic or exaggerating about my health stuff. When we were teenagers she used to roll her eyes when I'd check my blood sugar at family dinners or make comments like ""must be nice to get all that attention.""

Last month she came to visit and stay at my place for a week. I live alone, work from home. She was in town for some conference. Things were fine at first but then she started making weird comments about my diabetes again. Asking why I ""still"" had it, if I'd tried just eating better, if I was sure I really needed insulin. I told her that's not how type 1 works and she got all huffy.

Three days into her visit I woke up and my insulin wasn't in the fridge. I keep it in the same spot always, the door shelf. I started looking everywhere because I knew I had two bottles. I was getting panicky because my blood sugar was already climbing and I needed to dose. My sensor was alarming.

I asked my sister if she'd seen it. She was drinking coffee at my kitchen table and she just shrugged. Said no. I kept looking, checking the trash, under things, in cabinets. My sugar was hitting 250 and I was starting to feel sick. Shaky and nauseous.

Then she laughed. Actually laughed. And said ""ok I threw it away.""

I just stared at her. Asked her what the hell she meant. She said she wanted to prove I was being dramatic and faking how serious it was for attention. That if I really needed it I would have ""reacted differently"" when it was gone. She thought I'd just shrug it off and be fine and that would prove her point.

I told her she could have killed me. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic again, that people don't die from missing one dose. I tried to explain DKA to her, that yes you absolutely can die, but she kept interrupting and saying she's a nurse and she knows what she's talking about.

My blood sugar was almost 300 at this point. I was dizzy and my vision was getting blurry. I told her I needed to go to the ER. She said I was overreacting to make her look bad. I called an ambulance because I literally couldn't drive safely.

I ended up in the ER for eight hours. They had to give me IV fluids and insulin through a drip. My potassium dropped dangerously low. The doctor said if I'd waited much longer I could have gone into a coma. The bill came out to just over $90,000 before insurance.

My sister left my apartment while I was in the hospital. Didn't even check if I was ok. She texted me two days later asking if we were ""cool"" and if I was still mad about her ""prank.""

I didn't respond. Then yesterday she called me crying, totally panicked. Apparently the hospital filed some kind of report because when I told them what happened they said they had to document it. Now the nursing board is investigating her for reckless endangerment or something. She could lose her license.

She was begging me to call the hospital and tell them I was confused, that it was an accident, that she didn't really throw away my insulin. She kept saying I was ruining her life over a joke and that I knew she didn't mean for me to actually get hurt.

I told her I wasn't doing that. She started screaming at me, saying I was vindictive and cruel and that I was destroying her career because I can't take a joke. That she's sorry but it wasn't that big of a deal.

Here's the thing though. I have a camera in my kitchen. It's just a basic security camera because my apartment got broken into last year. I checked the footage and it clearly shows her taking both bottles out of my fridge and throwing them in the trash outside on my balcony. She looks right at the camera at one point.

I sent the footage to the hospital administrator when they contacted me for a statement. I didn't tell my sister I had it until after I'd already sent it.

Now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom is crying saying I'm tearing the family apart and that my sister made a mistake but she doesn't deserve to lose everything. My dad said I should have just let it go and handled it privately instead of involving authorities. My sister sent me a long text about how I've always been jealous of her success and this is me finally getting revenge for her being the ""pretty one"" growing up.

My best friend says I did the right thing but my cousin says I went too far and should have just accepted her apology. Even my aunt who's also diabetic says maybe I should consider that my sister really didn't understand the severity.

But she's a nurse. She literally works in a hospital. And she watched me deteriorate for over an hour before I called 911 and didn't do anything.

I don't know. My family keeps calling and leaving voicemails. My sister showed up at my apartment last night and I didn't answer the door. She sat outside crying for twenty minutes before she left.

I love buying Christmas gifts for my bonus granddaughter because she’s 7 and we buy with consciousness when we buy for her. It isn’t just a bunch of frivolous toys, but clothes and toys we know she will enjoy. I try to be conscious about what I buy for the rest of my family. My issue is receiving gifts because I have become anti-wasteful, thoughtless mess during the holidays. 

Which leads to my current anxiety. FIL and Current Wife (he’s been married 3 times previous to this current wife) sent us a gift and I am feeling negative and worried about it. They have a long history of sending things that are almost always useless to us. Case in point: Several years ago, they sent us a gift card to a grocery store that doesn’t even exist in our state. We had to regift it to a family member who lives in their state. They’ve sent me pajamas I would never wear, a purse that I didn’t need, and a set of coffee mugs we would never use. We’re second thoughts because all the focus is on Current Wife’s family and DH’s youngest sister and her family (there’s an awkward story to that hyper focus). Current Wife is a chronic hoarder and has a shopping disorder. Her hoarding caused FIL to fall and break his hip a few years ago. 

I’m absolutely dreading what could be coming in the mail next week. I know it sounds petty, but I wish they would just stick to sending Amazon gift cards and letting us purchase what we need. They’re sending us my adult bonus kids’ gifts, too, even though they have their addresses. I know our family is just an afterthought but sending useless crap is more a slap in the face than not sending anything at all. In fact, it would make me feel better if they didn’t. DH says it’s more FIL sending it and feeling like he has to. But FIL doesn’t have much in the way of finances, and he has aggressively advancing Parkinson’s, so I’m doing my best to be open minded. However, I know Current Wife’s has the most hand in this. I can almost guarantee whatever has been sent will likely end up going to Goodwill. ",0,1766246408.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,0.5,False

I have tattooes and piercings, and I'm quite queer in my way of being, so don't bother if it's not your vibe. Im more than down to exchange photos.

I'm looking for stable and genuine connections - I'm pansexual and probably demisexual, so the only option for me is a slow burn type. Ideally I'm looking for someone that shares my hobbies and ideals, so we can do stuff together, and be each others comfort people. Let's laugh, play and do nothing together. I've had my fair shair of experiences and all I ask from another person is honesty, communication and maturity - I don't mind your past, whatever it might be, we can trauma dump each other once we feel comfortable together :>

I'm working full time and doing my masters. In my free time I write stories, compose music and hang with friends. Other than that my big hobbies are video games, cinema, music, cooking, MTG, art, theatre and many, many more.

Talk to me about your hiperfixation and I'll drench you in cinema trivia and scene by scene analysis. I adore all things fantasy - currently re-reading Earthsea and I really wanna dip into something new.

I'm a bubbly person, i ll yap you to death - i love passionate people and hearing about their stuff - my humor stopped developin at age 5 and any loud noise and funny sound will have me in tears. I care about the connections i form, but I don't trust easily.

Concerning deal breakers: i dont really see myself as a father and i would really prefer someone from europe. Politically i'm left, philosophically absurdist, no addictions. I ve done a lot of therapy and I'm diagnosed with CPTSD and chronic depression, but I'm medicated and have it under control. I consider myself a part of LGBTQ+ community and fight for equality.

I'm 178cm tall, clean shaven, medium long, brown, wavy, thick hair, muscly under a cloud of love, people say i have a nice voice and a face, so i ll leave it at that xd  
I have tattooes and piercings, and I'm quite queer in my way of being, so don't bother if it's not your vibe. Im more than down to exchange photos.

I'm looking for stable and genuine connections - I'm pansexual and probably demisexual, so the only option for me is a slow burn type. Ideally I'm looking for someone that shares my hobbies and ideals, so we can do stuff together, and be each others comfort people. Let's laugh, play and do nothing together. I've had my fair shair of experiences and all I ask from another person is honesty, communication and maturity - I don't mind your past, whatever it might be, we can trauma dump each other once we feel comfortable together :>

I'm working full time and doing my masters. In my free time I write stories, compose music and hang with friends. Other than that my big hobbies are video games, cinema, music, cooking, MTG, art, theatre and many, many more. Definately more of a homebody, but i love occassional pawn shop runs, coffee shop hopping and outdoorsy stuff. I also collect controllers, CDs and anything that does a goofy sound. Talk to me about your hiperfixation and I'll drench you in cinema trivia and scene by scene analysis. I adore all things fantasy - currently re-reading Earthsea and I really wanna dip into something new.

I'm a bubbly person, i ll yap you to death - i love passionate people and hearing about their stuff - my humor stopped developin at age 5 and any loud noise and funny sound will have me in tears. I care about the connections i form, but I don't trust easily.

Concerning deal breakers: i dont really see myself as a father and i would really prefer someone from europe. Politically i'm left, philosophically absurdist, no addictions. I ve done a lot of therapy and I'm diagnosed with CPTSD and chronic depression, but I'm medicated and have it under control. I consider myself a part of LGBTQ+ community and fight for equality.

Aaaanyway, that's an abridged version of me, drop me a message if i sound like your guy. Have a good whatever!

Do not escape any of the function call arguments. The arguments will be parsed as normal text.

You can use multiple tools in parallel by calling them together.

# Available Tools:

1. **Code Execution**

* **Description:**: This is a stateful code interpreter you have access to. You can use the code interpreter tool to check the code execution output of the code. Here the stateful means that it's a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) like environment, so previous code execution result is preserved. You have access to the files in the attachments. If you need to interact with files, reference file names directly in your code (e.g., open('test.txt', 'r')).

Here are some tips on how to use the code interpreter:

* Make sure you format the code correctly with the right indentation and formatting.
* You have access to some default environments with some basic and STEM libraries:
   * Environment: Python 3.12.3
   * Basic libraries: tqdm, ecdsa
   * Data processing: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl
   * Math: sympy, mpmath, statsmodels, PuLP
   * Physics: astropy, qutip, control
   * Biology: biopython, pubchempy, dendropy
   * Chemistry: rdkit, pyscf
   * Finance: polygon
   * Game Development: pygame, chess
   * Multimedia: mido, midiutil
   * Machine Learning: networkx, torch
   * others: snappy

You only have internet access for polygon through proxy. The api key for polygon is configured in the code execution environment. Keep in mind you have no internet access. Therefore, you CANNOT install any additional packages via pip install, curl, wget, etc.  
You must import any packages you need in the code. When reading data files (e.g., Excel, csv), be careful and do not read the entire file as a string at once since it may be too long. Use the packages (e.g., pandas and openpyxl) in a smart way to read the useful information in the file.  
Do not run code that terminates or exits the repl session.

   * video\_url: : The url of the video you wish to view. (type: string) (required)

1. **Search Images**

* **Description:**: This tool searches for a list of images given a description that could potentially enhance the response by providing visual context or illustration. Use this tool when the user's request involves topics, concepts, or objects that can be better understood or appreciated with visual aids, such as descriptions of physical items, places, processes, or creative ideas. Only use this tool when a web-searched image would help the user understand something or see something that is difficult for just text to convey. For example, use it when discussing the news or describing some person or object that will definitely have their image on the web. Do not use it for abstract concepts or when visuals add no meaningful value to the response.

Only trigger image search when the following factors are met:

* Explicit request: Does the user ask for images or visuals explicitly?
* Visual relevance: Is the query about something visualizable (e.g., objects, places, animals, recipes) where images enhance understanding, or abstract (e.g., concepts, math) where visuals add values?
* User intent: Does the query suggest a need for visual context to make the response more engaging or informative?

This tool returns a list of images, each with a title, webpage url, and image url.

* **Action**: search\_images
* **Arguments**:
   * image\_description: : The description of the image to search for. (type: string) (required)
   * number\_of\_images: : The number of images to search for. Default to 3. (type: integer)(optional) (default: 3)

* **Description:**: This tool is for searching establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest, like dining, retail, recreation, or services, using the Google Maps API.
* **You must call this tool at least once** for queries about physical locations (e.g., ""coffee shop in San Francisco, CA"", ""parks near Seattle, WA"", ""best revolving sushi bar in Tokyo, Japan"").
* Use clear queries like ""a type of place in location"" (e.g., ""modern art museums in Paris, France"", ""kid-friendly library in Arcadia, CA""). Be specific about the description of place and the location if possible.
* Do NOT use this tool for non-place queries (e.g., sports, music, events, or general knowledge like ""capital of France"").
   * **Action**: call\_google\_places\_api
   * **Arguments**:
      * query: : The query to search for places (type: string) (required)

# Render Components:

You use render components to display content to the user in the final response. Make sure to use the following format for render components, including the \`  
Do not escape any of the arguments. The arguments will be parsed as normal text.

# Available Render Components:

1. **Render Searched Image**

* **Description:**: Render images in final responses to enhance text with visual context when giving recommendations, sharing news stories, rendering charts, or otherwise producing content that would benefit from images as visual aids. Always use this tool to render an image. Do not use render\_inline\_citation or any other tool to render an image. Images will be rendered in a carousel layout if there are consecutive render\_searched\_image calls.
* Do NOT render images within markdown tables.
* Do NOT render images within markdown lists.
* Do NOT render images at the end of the response.
   * **Type**: render\_searched\_image
   * **Arguments**:
      * image\_id: : The id of the image to render. Extract the image\_id from the previous search\_images tool result which has the format of '\[image:image\_id\]'. (type: integer) (required)
      * size: : The size of the image to generate/render. (type: string)(optional) (can be any one of: SMALL, LARGE) (default: SMALL)

1. **Render Card**

* **Description:**: Display a rich content card that generated previously by calling the call\_finance\_api, call\_crypto\_api, call\_sports\_api, call\_weather\_api, and call\_google\_places\_api tools. If you have called those tools and have successfully generated a card, always call this tool to render the card when you're ready to give the final answer. Do not repeat the same card multiple times. Each unique card should be used at most once. Place the cards where they most effectively support the claims in the answer. Try to include the cards as early as possible in the answer. Verify relevance before adding.

Identify the previously generated cards by finding <card id=""card\_id"" type=""card\_type""> from the previous tool call results.

* **Type**: render\_card
* **Arguments**:
   * card\_id: : String ID of finance/sports/weather/places card (NOT image\_id). Extract from <card id='VALUE'> in API response. (type: string) (required)

Interweave render components within your final response where appropriate to enrich the visual presentation. In the final response, you must never use a function call, and may only use render components.

* **Description:**: This tool searches for a list of images given a description that could potentially enhance the response by providing visual context or illustration. Use this tool when the user's request involves topics, concepts, or objects that can be better understood or appreciated with visual aids, such as descriptions of physical items, places, processes, or creative ideas. Only use this tool when a web-searched image would help the user understand something or see something that is difficult for just text to convey. For example, use it when discussing the news or describing some person or object that will definitely have their image on the web. Do not use it for abstract concepts or when visuals add no meaningful value to the response.

Only trigger image search when the following factors are met:

* Explicit request: Does the user ask for images or visuals explicitly?
* Visual relevance: Is the query about something visualizable (e.g., objects, places, animals, recipes) where images enhance understanding, or abstract (e.g., concepts, math) where visuals add values?
* User intent: Does the query suggest a need for visual context to make the response more engaging or informative?

* Use clear queries like ""a type of place in location"" (e.g., ""modern art museums in Paris, France"", ""kid-friendly library in Arcadia, CA""). Be specific about the description of place and the location if possible.
* Do NOT use this tool for non-place queries (e.g., sports, music, events, or general knowledge like ""capital of France"").
   * **Action**: call\_google\_places\_api
   * **Arguments**:
      * query: : The query to search for places (type: string) (required)

# Render Components:

You use render components to display content to the user in the final response. Make sure to use the following format for render components, including the \`  
Do not escape any of the arguments. The arguments will be parsed as normal text.

# Available Render Components:

1. **Render Searched Image**

* **Description:**: Render images in final responses to enhance text with visual context when giving recommendations, sharing news stories, rendering charts, or otherwise producing content that would benefit from images as visual aids. Always use this tool to render an image. Do not use render\_inline\_citation or any other tool to render an image. Images will be rendered in a carousel layout if there are consecutive render\_searched\_image calls.
* Do NOT render images within markdown tables.
* Do NOT render images within markdown lists.
* Do NOT render images at the end of the response.
   * **Type**: render\_searched\_image
   * **Arguments**:

1. **Render Card**

* **Description:**: Display a rich content card that generated previously by calling the call\_finance\_api, call\_crypto\_api, call\_sports\_api, call\_weather\_api, and call\_google\_places\_api tools. If you have called those tools and have successfully generated a card, always call this tool to render the card when you're ready to give the final answer. Do not repeat the same card multiple times. Each unique card should be used at most once. Place the cards where they most effectively support the claims in the answer. Try to include the cards as early as possible in the answer. Verify relevance before adding.

Identify the previously generated cards by finding <card id=""card\_id"" type=""card\_type""> from the previous tool call results.

* **Type**: render\_card
* **Arguments**:
   * card\_id: : String ID of finance/sports/weather/places card (NOT image\_id). Extract from <card id='VALUE'> in API response. (type: string) (required)

Interweave render components within your final response where appropriate to enrich the visual presentation. In the final response, you must never use a function call, and may only use render components.

1prhlfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1prhlfd/your_life_changed_when_you_relied_less_on/,"**Your life changed when you relied less on motivation, and more on discipline: the real glow-up no one talks about**","
Let’s be honest. Most of us aren’t lazy, we’re just tired of chasing that elusive thing called “motivation.” You know, waiting around till you magically feel like going to the gym, writing that paper, fixing your resume, or cleaning your disaster of an apartment. And if your algorithm looks anything like mine, TikTok and IG are flooded with influencers yelling “Just manifest it!” or “If you wanted it bad enough, you’d do it.”  

That’s not just wrong. It’s dangerous.  

As someone who studied psychology and behavioral science at Harvard, I can confidently say this: motivation is a mood. Discipline is a system.  

We’ve been set up to believe that change and improvement require feeling inspired first. But the science says otherwise. In fact, the most successful people build their lives around systems, habits, and consistency, not fleeting emotion.  

Here’s the no BS guide that helped me and many others break the toxic motivation loop, and it’s all backed by real research, not just some dude in a hoodie screaming at his phone.



\*\*Useful mindset shifts to break up with motivation addiction:\*\*

- \*\*Action creates emotion, not the other way around.\*\* Behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg found in his Stanford research that “tiny habits” lead to long-term transformation. Waiting to feel inspired before taking action is backwards. Start small, then momentum builds motivation.

- \*\*Discipline is a muscle, not a personality trait.\*\* Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford) explains on his podcast that willpower is trainable. Cold exposure, delayed gratification, and specific routines literally rewire the prefrontal cortex, your brain's control center.

- \*\*You don’t need to feel like it. You just need to do it.\*\* That’s not toxic hustle culture. That’s how habits get automated. According to James Clear’s bestseller \*Atomic Habits\*, the key to long-term behavior change is identity-based habits. You act like the person you want to become, before you feel like them.



\*\*Actual tools that make discipline easier (not harder):\*\*

- \*\*Use implementation intentions.\*\* Instead of ""I’ll work out tomorrow,"" say: ""After I drink my morning coffee at 8am, I’ll do 20 minutes of bodyweight exercises."" This hack from Dr. Peter Gollwitzer’s psychology research boosts follow-through by up to 91%.

- \*\*Habit stacking.\*\* Pair a new habit with an existing one. Example: right after brushing teeth, do 2 minutes of journaling. It’s from \*Atomic Habits\* and helps anchor your routines.

- \*\*Track streaks, not time.\*\* Apps like Streaks, Finch, or even a calendar with red Xs (like Jerry Seinfeld used) reinforce consistency. You want to make breaking the streak feel harder than sticking to it.

- \*\*Design friction.\*\* Put your phone in another room before bed. Lay out gym clothes the night before. Environment > willpower. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that most decision-making is shaped by context, not intention.



\*\*Best books that made me rethink everything about motivation and discipline:\*\*

- \*\*""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield\*\*  
  This cult classic is short, punchy, and brutal. It slaps down every excuse you’ve ever had. Pressfield calls procrastination “Resistance” and treats it like a living enemy. It’s the best book I’ve ever read on creative discipline. You’ll finish it ready to destroy your inner laziness.

- \*\*""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport\*\*  
  A Wall Street Journal bestseller by a Georgetown professor. This book changed how I think about attention. Newport argues that focus is a rare and valuable skill most people have lost. He backs it with research and gives a full system for getting into flow. If you’ve ever felt foggy, distracted, or like your brain is fried, this is your reset button.

- \*\*""Can’t Hurt Me"" by David Goggins\*\*  
  Not your typical self-help read. Goggins is a former Navy SEAL who went from obese to elite athlete. He’s extreme, but the message is real: discipline builds a bulletproof mind. This book will make you uncomfortable in the best way possible. You’ll walk away feeling like you’ve been lied to about your limits.



\*\*Free and low-lift apps that help you build discipline (and actually stick to it):\*\*

- \*\*BeFreed\*\*  
  This one’s next level. It’s an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It takes books, podcasts, expert research, and real-world success stories and turns them into a podcast-style learning plan based on your interests. It’s perfect for people working on self-discipline, habit building, or mental strength. You even get to pick your host’s voice and mood, I picked a dry, sarcastic one that feels like a no-nonsense coach. It adapts to what you listen to and builds a learning plan over time. It also covers all the books I mentioned above in its massive audio library. Great if you want science-backed knowledge without doomscrolling for hours.

- \*\*Insight Timer\*\*  
  Guided meditations, focus music, and time tracking. It’s not just woo-woo stuff. They have meditations specifically for building consistency and reducing procrastination. Also great for winding down without screen time.

- \*\*Finch\*\*  
  This is for people who need a cute dopamine hit. It gamifies self-care with a digital pet that grows as you check off goals and routines. Surprisingly effective if you’re motivated by visuals and small wins.



\*\*Podcasts and YouTubes that go way deeper than “just hustle harder”:\*\*

- \*\*The Huberman Lab Podcast\*\*  
  Dr. Andrew Huberman shares neuroscience-backed tips for increasing motivation, managing dopamine, and rewiring habits. It’s long-form but worth it. His deep dive on discipline and goal setting is a must-listen.

- \*\*Matt D’Avella on YouTube\*\*  
  Minimalist filmmaker who explores discipline, habit change, and lifestyle design. It’s aesthetically soothing and packed with practical advice. Not preachy. Just honest.

- \*\*The Tim Ferriss Show\*\*  
  He interviews top performers from all industries and always drills into routines, systems, and discipline. Tons of gold here.



Discipline isn’t about being strict or joyless. It’s about doing what matters, especially when you don’t feel like it. You don’t need to wait for a wave of motivation to hit. You just need tools, habits, and systems that make doing the hard things easier.

Motivation is a spark. Discipline is the engine.

I prefer drip at my favorite coffee shops above pour overs because they always come out lukewarm.  They are tasty, just not hot enough.  I like my drip from the coffee shops to have that thin, tea-like consistency and piping hot.  So I’ve done all I could to try and replicate it at home!  I thought I was doing something!  I got a kuerig with pods you can make yourself!  

I thought I’d get a bag of my fave coffee and put in the pods and I’d have coffee as good as Reanimators at home!  Nope!!! Flat trash is what it produced.  Returned that and got a moka pot.  Very good but the coffee texture was thicker which I didn’t care for.  Then I got a ninja coffee maker and a Krups spice/coffee bean grinder!  

Bought another bag, still trash.  I gave up.   Then I looked up the v60.  Saw a guy in a video using a grinder with the v60.  Googled that and landed here.  Picked out a scale (acacia pearl s), fellow stagg kettle and base.  And an ode fellow 2 grinder.  I thought I picked the top of the line grinder on the market.  Googled it and landed here.  Found out there’s grinders with burrs that are shaped like cones and then flat burrs and retention and that these things can get to be well over $1,000!  

Do more research and learn about the Aiden from here.  Did more research and found the xbloom Studio (which I’m going to purchase).  Did more researching found it has conical burrs.  Thought, cool, maybe I can try to find the exact grinder they use at my coffee shop.  It was an EK43.  Googled the price…. Holy!!!! $2400!!!  Thought long and hard about it.  Do I really need the ek43 with the xbloom?  I like the automization the xbloom gives since I never made my own pour over.  Plus I love the idea of those pods.   Side note I am also replacing my ninja with a Moccamaster, which I also learned about here.  

I figure either the Lagom p80, the Mazzer Philos, the Zerno Z1, or go all the way and get the ek43 and never have to buy another grinder in life.  ",2,1766246211.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

I'm 178cm tall, clean shaven, medium long, brown, wavy, thick hair, muscly under a cloud of love, people say i have a nice voice and a face, so i ll leave it at that xd   
I have tattooes and piercings, and I'm quite queer in my way of being, so don't bother if it's not your vibe. Im more than down to exchange photos.

I'm looking for stable and genuine connections - I'm pansexual and probably demisexual, so the only option for me is a slow burn type. Ideally I'm looking for someone that shares my hobbies and ideals, so we can do stuff together, and be each others comfort people. Let's laugh, play and do nothing together. I've had my fair shair of experiences and all I ask from another person is honesty, communication and maturity - I don't mind your past, whatever it might be, we can trauma dump each other once we feel comfortable together :>  

I'm working full time and doing my masters. In my free time I write stories, compose music and hang with friends. Other than that my big hobbies are video games, cinema, music, cooking, MTG, art, theatre and many, many more. Definately more of a homebody, but i love occassional pawn shop runs, coffee shop hopping and outdoorsy stuff. I also collect controllers, CDs and anything that does a goofy sound. Talk to me about your hiperfixation and I'll drench you in cinema trivia and scene by scene analysis. I adore all things fantasy - currently re-reading Earthsea and I really wanna dip into something new. 

I'm a bubbly person, i ll yap you to death - i love passionate people and hearing about their stuff - my humor stopped developin at age 5 and any loud noise and funny sound will have me in tears. I care about the connections i form, but I don't trust easily.

I ve done a lot of therapy and I'm diagnosed with CPTSD and chronic depression, but I'm medicated and have it under control. I consider myself a part of LGBTQ+ community and fight for equality.

Typically I have 1 cup a day with an occasional second on the weekends. This results in less than 400mg of caffeine consistently. 

Recently I had some stomach upset which made me stop coffee until it resolved. Within 2 days I started getting palpitations and flutters. Freaked me out. I initially thought something was seriously wrong, or that the stomach issues were causing it. These lasted about 5 days and have finally reduced to nearly none. I only just recently made the connection that it COULD have been because I stopped coffee due to the stomach upset. Maybe it was withdrawal? So now I’m concerned that it was and am considering what to do.  

I’m down to either switching to decaf or quitting all together. I love my morning coffee. I do not care about the caffeine and IMO over the years with the occasional coffee (prior to a year ago, after was 1 a day) and or energy drink I don’t believe I noticed much effect of caffeine. I don’t drink energy drinks anymore, I just like my coffee flavor. 

If what I was experiencing was withdrawal, would decaf bridge the gap of allowing me to enjoy the coffee but not experience heart disturbances when stopped (ie when sick or similar)? Or is it best to just call it quits? I contemplated tea but there’s still caffeine. Decaf Nespresso coffee contains 2mg of caffeine vs the 160-200 a normal one has.

At home. In bed. While eating, drinking, or even shitting, thoughts about the climb or the game ran were always on standby in my subconscious, ready to be looked over.

My FYP on most socials became league. Free time was watching content about the game or on summoner’s rift actually playing. It’s good to have an hobby you deeply like. Something to enter a flow state on, something to enjoy.

But damn, the competitive aspect of the climb and me fixating over LP really butchered the fun out of the game for me.

If I had a hot streak my day never felt better. Whereas loss streaks would tilt me to the moon and ruin my entire day or week.

I have always been a casual player at the game. I played a couple years ago but was hard stuck gold. Never made it out of there even though I had hundreds of games per season.

I really never approached climbing as seriously as I did this season though. I climbed for silver 1 to diamond 4, ONLY playing a handful of champions I am actually comfortable at and like their kit. Most days, fun was out of the question, I could not afford to mess up. In draft, I rarely picked anything I didn’t feel 100% on.

Loads of coffee. Sometimes stimulants. A clear head, full focus. If I felt any was lacking I didn’t bother queuing up because I feared a loss was imminent. Climbing really became its own ritual. Fear of loss became so intense I lost the will to play after hitting my goal.

Yeah I am happy about diamond. But my approach was not healthy. I am currently at D4 0 LP and refusing to play ranked because I don’t feel like it’s worth going through the same cycle again. I don’t feel like playing that sweaty anymore.

Norms don’t hit the itch either. Because there’s barely anything on the table, and the game feels so unserious. My OCD-ish and addictive tendencies got the best of me.

All this to say, I definitely need a break. Don’t be like me. If you feel the climb isn’t worth the hassle anymore and are barely enjoying the game anymore you definitely need some time off before it engulfs you like it did me.",6,1766246050.0,summonerschool,7,1.0,False

I’ve heard the tales, of course I have, frequenting the places I do. A fearsome Skinwalker becomes your lover on a romantic retreat, until you’re close enough that a kiss on the neck becomes teeth piercing the skin over your throat. Some unknowable being living in the forest on the edge of your property tempts you, lures you in with whispers of paranoia, drinking in your fear and then multiplying it tenfold as it echoes aloud what lurks in the darkest recesses of your mind. Or maybe a strange man who wears your clothes, hair, and face sinks a knife into your gut at a gas station in the dead of night, right in front of the poor cashier.



Whenever I catch a whiff of one of those stories, my mind always wonders, why? Why that person? Why that strategy to take them? Do they need to think out their path to their prey or is it pure animal instinct, built into their nature? Any opinions on the memories of life that surely flood their minds with each target, aiding their imitation of family and friends?

Venezuela: a primer

Why is Trump turning up the temperature for a new war in Latin America?

  
On 2 September 2025, the US military carried out airstrikes on small vessels in the Caribbean it said were linked to Venezuelan narcotics trafficking, marking a shift from sanctions enforcement to the use of lethal force. That escalation deepened on 10 December, when US authorities seized a sanctioned oil tanker operating out of Venezuela, followed by additional US naval deployments to the region to enforce oil export restrictions. Venezuelan authorities responded by escorting tankers with naval vessels, while Washington has insisted these actions do not amount to a formal blockade.

While this confrontation could easily fizzle out, it is also possible that Venezuela becomes one of the defining geopolitical flashpoints of 2026. Either way, the country is likely to feature heavily in headlines in the months ahead. This piece is therefore a background guide to how Venezuela reached its current position, and how its economy and society function day to day.

# The national origin

Venezuela is a country roughly 4x the size of the United Kingdom, located on the northern edge of South America, with a long Caribbean coastline. Its geography is varied: dense jungle in the south, wide plains known as the *llanos* across the centre, mountains in the west, and a relatively narrow but strategically important coastal strip. Human habitation dates back at least 8,000 years, with indigenous groups living by hunting, fishing, and small-scale agriculture long before European contact.

Europeans first arrived in 1498, when Christopher Columbus sighted the Venezuelan coast on his third voyage. Early Spanish settlement focused less on land conquest than extraction, particularly pearl fishing along the islands and shallow coastal waters, which relied heavily on forced indigenous labour. The territory remained a marginal part of the Spanish Empire, lacking the large mineral deposits that drew sustained imperial attention elsewhere. Venezuela declared independence from Spain in 1811, followed by a long and destructive war that ended in 1821, driven by local elites and military leaders seeking autonomy from a distant colonial state rather than mass popular mobilisation.

At the start of the 1900s, Venezuela was relatively poor by Latin American standards. Its economy was based on agriculture and cattle ranching, infrastructure was limited, and the state was weak and fragmented after decades of civil conflict. Unlike Argentina or Chile, it had not yet found a clear export engine.

# Black Gold

Oil was discovered in commercial quantities in the early 1900s, with the first major strike at Zumaque I in 1914. By the 1920s, foreign firms, mainly British and American, were extracting crude at scale, and by the 1930s Venezuela had become one of the world’s largest oil exporters. Oil rapidly displaced cattle, coffee, and cocoa as the dominant source of income, exports, and state revenue.

This transformation created a classic rentier state. The Venezuelan government did not need to tax its population heavily to function. Instead, it distributed oil rents through public employment, subsidies, and infrastructure spending. That arrangement brought real gains. Living standards rose, cities expanded, and by the mid-20th century Venezuela was one of the richest countries in Latin America on a per capita basis, attracting migrants from across the region and southern Europe. Caracas in particular developed the institutions and lifestyle of a middle-income country rather than a post-colonial backwater.

As the state was funded by oil rather than taxation, accountability mechanisms remained weak. Political competition focused on controlling the distribution of oil revenue, not on improving productivity or building a diversified economy. Manufacturing remained limited, agriculture stagnated, and imports filled the gap. When oil prices were high, this fragility was invisible. When prices fell, it became immediately painful.

Oil nationalisation in 1976 formalised this model rather than changing it. The state-owned oil company, PDVSA, was initially well run and technically competent, staffed by trained engineers and managers who operated with a degree of autonomy from day-to-day politics. For several decades, this worked tolerably well. Venezuela enjoyed long periods of macroeconomic stability and rising consumption, even as the underlying economy became more dependent on a single commodity.

By the late 1990s, however, the limits of the system were clear. Oil revenue was volatile, inequality remained high despite decades of spending, and the non-oil economy was weak. The state was large but brittle, rich on paper and poor in resilience. When a political movement emerged promising to reclaim oil wealth for the people, it was building on a structure that already existed rather than inventing something new.

# Chávez

Hugo Chávez was a rather unconventional political outsider: in 1992, as a mid-ranking army officer, he led a failed military coup against the elected government. He was imprisoned, then pardoned two years later, and entered politics with his coup attempt having elevated him to national prominence. This trajectory mattered: from the outset, Chávez viewed electoral politics as one route to power rather than its sole source, and his later willingness to weaken institutions followed a pattern established before he ever won office.

Chávez took office in 1999 at a time of widespread frustration with Venezuela’s political class. For many ordinary Venezuelans, especially in poorer urban areas, the early years of his presidency brought visible changes. Public spending increased, new social programmes were rolled out in health, education, and food distribution, and access to basic services improved in neighbourhoods that had long been neglected. For a large part of the population, daily life became more secure through the 2000s, particularly while oil prices were high.

These gains should not be read as the result of European-style social democratic policy. Many programmes were poorly administered, highly politicised, and vulnerable to corruption. Distribution was often discretionary rather than universal, with benefits expanding sharply ahead of elections and contracting afterward. Competence varied widely, waste was common, and loyalty increasingly mattered more than performance. For recipients, this still represented real improvement over what came before, but it was not a stable or rules-based welfare system, and was a rot that would later cause a sharp collapse.

The opposition during this period was real but uneven. It was strongest among the middle and upper classes, business owners, parts of the professional class, and residents of wealthier urban areas, especially in eastern Caracas. Many in these groups experienced Chávez’s rule as disruptive and threatening, particularly as property rights weakened and state control expanded. The opposition also included parts of organised labour and civil society, but it struggled to unite around a coherent alternative or leadership.

Political conflict escalated in the early 2000s, most sharply during the failed coup attempt in 2002 and the subsequent oil strike in 2002–03. After this point, the balance of power shifted decisively. The government moved to marginalise opponents institutionally: opposition media faced increasing pressure, senior civil servants and managers were dismissed, and loyalty became a prerequisite for advancement in the public sector. Elections continued, but the playing field became steadily less even.

For most ordinary people, however, this period was not experienced as a collapse. Food was available, wages were paid, and consumption rose. Subsidised imports kept prices down, and the state absorbed economic shocks through spending. Emigration existed but was limited, largely involving professionals, business owners, and politically active opponents. The idea of leaving the country was present, but not yet dominant.

By the time of Chávez’s death in 2013, Venezuela was politically polarised but not yet socially disastrous. Daily life functioned, institutions still operated, and the economy had not yet contracted. The mass exodus that would later define the country’s crisis had not begun in earnest.

for a few weeks. I first got the job because the previous radio host had gone missing.

It was a station based in a small town named Iron Lake so it was the kind of station that

only a handful of people listened to. I would mostly air music that was popular within the

town, interrupted by small segments where I would take music requests from callers or

have guest speakers over at the station. I did these segments around once every few

hours. I also had a boss who would pop in every few days. He was also my

landlord, which is how I had first heard about the job opening at the station.



A few days ago, I started experiencing some odd events involving the station. It started

out as a day like any other, nothing out of the usual.  As I was receiving some music

 requests, a caller put in a request for a song called Coffee at Nellie’s.

The callers voice was monotone, almost robotic. I didn’t pay much attention to it.

However, once I looked up Coffee at Nellie’s to play it I wasn’t able to find anything at all.

I shrugged it off as someone misremembering the song’s name and went about my day.



Things got weird once I got home. I stayed at a small duplex, I lived on the side of the

house with the blue door, while the unit next to mine had a green door. My boss owned

both units. That night as I was trying to get to sleep, I started hearing radio static

from next door. The sort of sound you would hear in between two radio stations.

Among the radio hissing, I could make out the lyrics to a song. The lyrics were about a

couple drinking coffee at a diner: Nellie’s Diner. The song was Coffee at Nellie’s.

I just thought that the next-door tenants were listening to music on the radio, and boiled

it down to a coincidence. The next day, I went to the station as usual.



At noon, I received a call from a man who wanted to come to the station and talk about

his new fishing gear shop on air. He arrived an hour later. He was an old, heavyset man

with a long beard. During our segment he talked about his new business, things like the

location, types of fishing gear, and discounts.

He eventually started talking about how passionate he was about fishing, talking about

fishing as if it was the greatest thing to grace the planet. He went on and on about how

he felt like he was making music while listening to the sounds of his fishing rod when

reeling fish in. I remember jokingly thinking to myself: ‘’He talks about fishing like

he’s writing a love song’’. I don’t think he’d have been too happy if I had said it out loud.

After the segment, he thanked me for my time and I went on with my daily broadcast

routine. 

That night, as I was trying to sleep at home, I once again started to hear radio

static from next door. Among the static, I could hear a voice. It was my own voice.

It was a loop of my voice saying the same phrase over and over: ‘’ He talks about fishing

like he’s writing a love song.’’. Unlike the song that had played the night before, this

couldn’t have been a coincidence. How did it know what I had thought of in

my mind? Was it just my head messing with me? Shaking with every step, I made my way

over to the next-door unit’s green door. I knocked on the door profusely, I started

shouting and asking who was inside. But there wasn’t a single sound, and the radio

noises were gone. I tried opening the door but it was locked shut. Afterwards, I noticed a

‘For Rent’ sign in front of the house. If the unit was empty, then what was making all

those noises? 



The next morning I texted my boss while on my way to work and told him

about the sounds I had heard coming from next-door. He told me he’d check the unit

during the day and let me know if anybody was there. Once I was at the station nothing

of note happened, no music requests, no guest speakers, just a fairly uneventful day.

After work, as I was heading home, I noticed that the green door of the next-door unit

was open. I thought my boss was checking to see if anyone was inside so I headed

in to talk to him. Once I entered the unit, my boss was nowhere to be seen. It was

completely empty except for a couch and a small cabinet. I decided to check the

bedroom, only to find a figure lying on the floor. I found a light switch and turned it on.

The figure on the floor was a dead body. It was the body of a man around his twenties. 



I was scared, I didn’t understand what was going on. There was a name tag on the man’s

shirt and it was for Channel 106. He was the previous radio host who had gone missing

weeks ago. He hadn’t died a violent death. He looked very skinny, like he had died from

starvation. I ran back to the front door, only to find it locked. Someone had locked it from

behind me. Could it have been my boss? Was he the one behind all of this? I tried calling

the police, but my phone ran out of battery. I tried breaking the door, but it was no use.

I felt absolutely hopeless. 



I looked around the unit and noticed a radio on top of the cabinet. 

It was the radio I had been hearing all of the noises from. I stayed up all night

next to the radio. I turned the dial to Channel 106 but it was completely silent as we were

off-hours. At around 8AM, the broadcast started. The voice of the host was of a man I’d

never heard before. He played music and took some song requests. He stated that this

was his first day working for the station, and that he was excited. He continued the usual

program schedule. 



Three days passed after I first got stuck in the house, and I was getting 

weak. I hadn’t had any food or water and I was nearing my death.

I was at a point where I could hardly speak or even stand up.

The body was starting to smell even worse. This morning, before the broadcast

had started, I heard some noises coming from my unit next door. It was the voice of my

boss and the new radio host, I couldn’t understand all of what they talked about but I

could make out the new host thanking my boss for letting him move into the unit. I tried

to make my voice heard, but at that point, I was too weak to yell. 



After the broadcast began, as the new host was taking music requests, he got a request for 

a familiar song: Coffee at Nellie’s. A bit later, he apologized for not being able to find the 

song and continued playing other music. 

The program went on until 11PM, and I was left with static.

I heard some noises coming from my unit, it was probably of the new host moving

in. Long after the broadcast had ended, at around 2AM, the radio started emitting the

loud hissing noise, it got louder until a song started playing: Coffee at Nellie’s.

Half an hour has passed since the song had started playing on the radio, I’m writing these

last sentences of my letter while listening to Coffee at Nellie’s inside the locked unit. I

don’t believe I have the energy to make it through tonight. If anybody finds this letter,

make sure that nobody else steps near the green door.‘’



This letter was recovered at the scene. Five bodies were found inside the unit with the

green door, all of whom had presumably died of isolation.

I’ve heard the tales, of course I have, frequenting the places I do. A fearsome Skinwalker becomes your lover on a romantic retreat, until you’re close enough that a kiss on the neck becomes teeth piercing the skin over your throat. Some unknowable being living in the forest on the edge of your property tempts you, lures you in with whispers of paranoia, drinking in your fear and then multiplying it tenfold as it echoes aloud what lurks in the darkest recesses of your mind. Or maybe a strange man who wears your clothes, hair, and face sinks a knife into your gut at a gas station in the dead of night, right in front of the poor cashier.



Whenever I catch a whiff of one of those stories, my mind always wonders, why? Why that person? Why that strategy to take them? Do they need to think out their path to their prey or is it pure animal instinct, built into their nature? Any opinions on the memories of life that surely flood their minds with each target, aiding their imitation of family and friends?

It's only the upper canines. It feels as if I have to urge to put large amounts of pressure on them. I tried biting a dish rag, but plastic seems to be the only consistency/give that feels good on my gums.

Big mistake. I *saw* things.

Handmade clothes, jewellery, paintings, ceramic bowls, all casually sitting there, silently judging my cupboard full of factory-made T-shirts.

The highlight for me was the Indigo dyed clothing from Smith Design Studio (attached). Not the “perfect showroom blue”, but the kind of blue that clearly took effort, time, and probably a lot of patience. Each piece looked like it had a personality… unlike my plain black tee which has seen too many washes and zero love.

Also realised:

* Handmade ≠ fragile
* Handmade = “this will outlive your fast-fashion phase”

Came back home with new appreciation for craft, mild guilt, and a strong urge to romanticise slow living while still ordering filter coffee outside.

1prh4l7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prh4l7,[Loved Trope] A monster's jumpscares works because of no obvious buildup,"I swear to GOD I am sick to death of the same bullshit 'scare' trope in horrors that involve a character slowly looking around a dark place with a building ascending violin note in the background that suddenly cuts to silence when the character finally looks round the corner, then they turn around and BAM! That dreadful LAZY rinsed jumpscare trope is what has prevented me from enjoying a lot of horror, which is what makes scenes like these all the better....

1. The Xenomorph vents (Alien 1979) - There's definitely some anxiety here but also a load of uncertainty with all the characters arguing about the direction our focused guy should go. The alien hasn't been seen for a while and darkness surrounds the screen. All we have is a crude beeping device for any anomaly whereabouts. The arguing about what direction to go in goes on for a while until the alien suddenly pops out and grabs him without warning.

2. The Creature's boat attack (Creature from the Black Lagoon) - I was genuinely surprised that a cheesy 50s monster flick could get me but one moment genuinely creeped me. Two crewmates talk about the situation on the boat and it's all treated as a normal dialogue scene. One of the crewmates then leaves and the other proceeds to look off balcony. It makes you think it's about to cut to the next scene, especially with no change in camera shot and no music being added. Suddenly, the creature quickly walks on-screen and grabs the chilling crewmate with zero warning. There is NO cinematic hint to it whatsoever, which makes it hit even for a rubber-suit classic!

3. The red demon (Insidious) - Probably the most famous example, where a normal coffee conversation between a couple is interrupted with the woman suddenly seeing a red demon pop up behind her man's head. It's not just the lack of any buildup, but how the blue color scheme of the scene trickily relaxes you into thinking it's a normal conversational moment before this blood-scarlet dude bangs out.",9,1766245029.0,TopCharacterTropes,6,1.0,False

Called her out on it and she abruptly filed for divorce and left. She was extremely disrespectful during the month or so she was living in the spare bedroom (talking to men on the phone in front of me, dressing up/going out every night etc).

We had two dogs together which I miss dearly. Due to my career field, I am not able to properly care for any pets alone. So, she took them.

I grieved the dogs as if they died months ago. I went strictly no-contact with her since she left during Spring.

She was not respecting boundaries and would text me to ""meet for coffee before court"" etc. So, I blocked her number about a month ago.

I received a call from a good friend of mine saying my STBXW contacted his wife saying she had to put one of the dogs down.

I feel awful but not as bad as I thought I would because I grieved them several months ago. It hurts because this dog was in great shape when I last saw her in my home. Not sure what happened to her to have to be put down but it was some type of stomach blockage.

I hate to sound malicious, but I am happy she recognized her number was blocked and I will never be there ever again in times of grief. She can grieve alone, just like I had to grieve alone when she blew up this marriage and betrayed me.

Growing up my parents would push me academically and they invested a lot of time in me. However, if I did things wrong, I would either be grounded or given the silent treatment. 

However, they would do everything they could for me in terms of getting the right support for me at school because I was very behind. During university, they rented out my bedroom so that they could pay my accommodation as my student loan didn't cover the cost. At one point they threatened not to pay but they said they didn't really mean it. 

They keep in touch with me as an adult on a family WhatsApp group. We exchange messages from time to time. However, I am not allowed in my mum's house as she says she gets stressed out by having visitors. She says I am being inflexible as I have moved to my grandfathers (she doesn't know this) and I don't have a London base. She says that I am inflexible as I am unable to meet with her in the day and as I have nowhere to stay over, it is difficult for me to meet in London. She views this as being inflexible. 

If I text my dad, she also reads the messages as she reads both of their messages. She also reads his emails. But he says he doesn't mind as he loves her etc. Recently he said that when my grandfather died, she would give me a bit of money but I needed to keep my mother happy by doing things like buying coffees, picking up the tabs during lunch etc during the break.

I met this guy on hinge and i feel like he slowly started to introduce me to the downsides of him but in the beggining i reassured it it was fine. Things like how he he(26) still lives with his mom, how he was embaraseed when we would leave their appartent and she would ask him if he needed some extra money, and how he was a little embarrassed by the fact that every morning she yells from across the kitchen "" time to wake up"" while shes making him breakfast.

Im not saying im perfect by any means because i Definity still live with my mom by its more of a shared living space with me and her. I help her with the bills/ my siblings, i do all of the grocery shopping, wake my self up and just am completely independ while living with my mom. Like if anything she ask me for spare money lol. I got a film degree in 2024 but after months of no work luck i got a job as a medical receptionist and i plan to make my way up wheather thats in healthcare or just in admin. I feel like given my moms track record ive been given no choise but to drop film and get it together if i want a better/ stable life for myself.

I think now that the eight months is over and the honey moon phase is over it just makes me think, and i getting myself into the right situation? He's been working at his dads repair shop since he was a kid so he gets paid not only under the table but whenever he dad sees fit. so he's not getting paid on a consistent basis. His mom is definitely a Karin and a hover parent. She has him on life 360 with the notifications on and she will literally track his every mom and she doesn't go to sleep until he gets home from the shop, sometimes at 12am as shes falling asleep on her recliner drinking coffee to stay up when she could literally just go to bed. I come over to their place ever weekend and given his long work hours, im spending more time with his mom than i am his and its to the point where i don't like ihs mom because i can see how much she coddles him and doesn't even realize

Realistically i don't think he's ever has to work hard for anything. His mom has him as an authorized user on her credit card, She gave him her old car and she has this mindset of of ""the economy is bad right now so he'll always have a place to stay. I would hate for him to go and try to find a place in his budget thas in a dangerous area"" ... hes a 26 year old grown man...

She's even mentioned that when he does choose to move out she'd me more than welcome to help out with the bills given his financial situation with his dad.

My publication is switching to USPS delivery which will delay the paper to irregular delivery times in the afternoon. By the time it is delivered I will be well into my day and I am not interested in reading a physical paper.

I do read news online during the day. Usually on mobile but this just does not equate to that early morning start with an actual newspaper and a hot cup of joe.

As a result I am probably going to give up the print edition. 

My paper does deliver an exact digital version of the actual paper but I am trying to figure out a comfortable way to read it in this format so I can continue enjoying that early morning quiet time with the news.

Obviously I could pull out my laptop and read it there but that is a far cry from the actual paper.

Having said this, I realize I will have to change so I am wondering if any of you have tips as to a comfortable approach to reading a digital paper which emulates as best possible the experience of reading a physical copy?

1prgpls,https://www.reddit.com/r/kanpur/comments/1prgpls/tired_of_thirdwheeling_with_my_husbands/,Tired of third-wheeling with my husband's cousins—any Kanpur girls want to vibe?,"Hey everyone. I’m 25 and moved to Kanpur about a year ago after living in Mumbai and Bangalore for a long time. I run my own digital marketing agency, so my life is mostly the corporate hustle, but I’m seriously missing having my own girl gang here.
Honestly, I’ve spent the last year exploring Kanpur with my husband and third-wheeling with his cousins, and I’m just over it. I need my own friends to talk nonsense with. I’m a good listener, and my friends usually say I give pretty solid advice—sort of the ""boss"" of the group but a fun one.
Here’s what I’m into:
• Work & Nonsense: I love talking about marketing and business, but I can also talk complete nonsense for hours.
• Binge-watching: I watch a lot of series. Huge fan of Big Bang Theory and I’m always down for a movie marathon, whether it’s horror or a rom-com.
• Gaming: I actually play Call of Duty (COD) and other mobile games when I’m chilling.
• High vibes: I love to party, dance, and I’m down for ""high vibe"" sessions.
• Creative & Spiritual: I also enjoy painting, meditation, and yoga.
• Travel & Food: Huge travel buff and always down for cafe hopping and exploring new spots.
I was thinking we could all meet up at a cafe soon—maybe for a painting session, coffee, or just a massive venting session about life. We’ll keep it simple: everyone pays for their own stuff so there’s no awkwardness.
Strictly for the girls—guys, please stay away.
Note on safety: Since Reddit can be sketchy, I’d prefer we exchange Instagram handles first to verify each other and make sure no one is getting catfished.
Also, I usually come as a ""package deal"" with my husband—he’s my personal driver and bodyguard for safety, but he stays out of the way or in the car so he won’t disturb us girls having fun.
If you’re in a similar boat and just want a real friend to hang out with, drop a comment or DM me. Let’s actually make some plans",3,1766243965.0,kanpur,3,1.0,False

1prgovh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1prgovh/10_days_of_diarrhea_but_ct_says_i_am_full_fever/,"10+ days of diarrhea but CT says I am full. Fever, immunosuppressed.","Female
45 years old
174cm tall
90kg
No recreational drugs, no smoke, no drink

Diagnoses: Psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lipedema, ADHD, dry eyes, rectocele, left side femoral and inguinal hernias (repaired July), left side unexplained radiculopathy + related damage and symptoms, chronic unexplained low left abdominal pain. 
 
Suspected: IBS, adenomyosis/endometriosis

Meds: Leflunomide 10mg (psoriatic stuff, doesn't work so far though, 6th week going on 7th), lisdexamphetamine 40mg (ADHD), zoely (menstruation control), ciclosporine eye drops, various eye lubricants, 37.5mg tramadol (+paracetamol/acetaminophen) for joint pain peaks from rheumatologist (averaging one every few days, on bad evenings. I dislike how it feels cognitively, and terrified of constipation due to hernia history and rectocele, so I'd also been taking magnesium sulfate). 

Recent history:
4-5 weeks of autoimmune flare, fatigue, joints and skin, after prednisone bridge injection wore off early. Flu and covid vaccine about a month ago. 

3 weeks ago CT for possible eagle syndrome showed also a mass on parathyroid gland, in notes: DD normal variation or adenoma. Not yet investigated, but I looked up relevant blood tests and checked my history: rheum checked my calcium several weeks ago and it was fine, only the muscle enzyme I forgot the name of was a bit elevated.

Since 10 days or so, and my current concern: Burning abdominal pain, mainly left center, radiates through whole abdomen. Overlapping, slightly more intense aching type pain, periodic, radiates to back. Other pains in different areas, brief, usually stabbing, mainly upper left and upper right. Pain level mostly 4-5, spikes to 6-7. Daytime/afternoon fevers (in ear) usually peaking at 38.5C/101.4F, back down to lowest I saw was 37.3C/99.4F late night and through the night. 

Diarrhea almost the whole time, mostly small amounts of lightly chunky soup texture that looks like what I ate the previous meal. Up to several times a day, but usually just a couple, loose to the point I felt I didn't need to take magnesium sulfate anymore. No blood. Low appetite, had been eating mostly 1-1.5 bowls of whole grain based meals or veggie soup in the evenings, and a *few* treats because holiday period, but constant nausea and low appetite. Drinking liquids throughout the day, every day. At worst the nausea got to the point of uncontrollable salivating but could hold it, except once. Vomited once Monday or so but was complicated by also being in severe sciatic pain in that particular moment. Probably the pain tipped me over. Heart rate keeps going 100-110bpm for hours at a time, then back down to 70s since this flare started (my recent previous normal was low 50s - low 60s).

Called urgent care Tuesday, told to call my GP. Called GP, explained, earliest appointment next Monday, booked. 

Called second urgent care Thursday for second opinion because slightly worsening symptoms, feeling crappy, and searching for any info or anything I could do about it online resulted in bold letters to go to ER because leflunomide + fever. 2nd opinion phone consult referred via phone back to my local urgent care, we made appointment and I went in later that evening. Although I had an appointment and was on time, they were very busy with only 1 doc. So, I attempted to alleviate discomfort by stretching and wiggling over the 2-ish hours in the waiting room. It did help in some positions, for a short time, but caused slowly increasing pain in my lower left abdomen in hernia repair area. I think this confused things and became a red herring. 

On exam: Palpation painful, guarding, not concerning, normal sounds, they said not surgical abdomen. Palpating anywhere caused pain in the left center spot, sometimes radiating to general left side, and also sharp ones in the lower left raising concern for hernia recurrence. Otherwise normal. Heart rate was 130 IIRC, BP 139/I forgot. Normally BP <110/80. Referred to ER mainly because of fever and immune suppression. 

In ER: Blood and urine taken, results good/normal, only thing out of range was very slightly elevated lipase, unconcerning. Urine healthy, +ketones. While waiting for results the lower left pain worked up to minutes-long attacks of level 8 pain (or so), after several hours of wiggling in discomfort. Could not talk through worst ones. ER doc pointed out my belly was a little swollen looking. I did have what felt like giant gas bubbles going back and forth with breathing sometimes, but came out over many hours as tiny little toots (feels less swollen today). Sent home with 10mg long release oxycodone, 4 sachets macrogol+electrolytes to prevent constipation and followup appointment for the next morning. Took 1 so I could sleep. 

Followup appointment yesterday morning, referred for urgent CT just to be safe. On CT: hernia repairs good, organs good, only a remarkable amount of normal looking stool filling what looked like my entire colon and more, fair amount of gas still, all else normal. The upper left and right pains apparently gas. Prescribed healthy diet. Felt like I wasted everyone's time and wondered if I had been eating more than I thought. 

Went back to pharmacy though and I picked up more macrogol sachets to try to clear out and see if that helped. I was still pretty uncomfortable from burning pain but lower left pain not so bad as long as I don't stretch and wiggle around. Decided not to take any more opioids since it might be constipation despite the diarrhea. 

Still just little bits of diarrhea. I have had 12 sachets macrogol+electrolytes with water in the past 28hr (stopped, feels like a lot), coffee, no food (no appetite, don't want to load more in either). Fever, 38.5C/101.3 again today. Still a little nauseous. Only regular meds and 500mg paracetamol this morning, hoping to take edge off a little. Maybe it did a very little. Still feel pretty crappy, like my guts are smouldering, but temp down to 38C/100.4F. 

I am still concerned about still having fever on immunosuppressants because of such bold warnings when I looked it up, but it is not clear to me or the docs why I have fever since everything looks ok. I am still in an autoimmune flare by how I feel, my joints, and how much my psoriasis has spread, despite low inflammation markers, but temp before, during flare(s), typically peaked at 37.9C/100.2F. Maybe just an extra intense flare? 

I called the hospital pharmacy today to ask about mineral oil, directed to look at drug stores and maybe call urgent care if it gets worse. Looked online, couldn't find mineral oil for internal use nearby. Can't really walk around looking and shopping. 
Feeling short of options I drank a cup of olive oil with lemon juice two hours ago. Keeping it all down but nothing out the other end except small amounts of smelly brown liquid still. Oil hasn't gone through yet. Occasional gurgles. Maybe I am just anxious. I mean clearly I am to some degree, I am posting here. Thanks for reading. 

Wait for GP appointment Monday and keep trying or waiting to clear out at home, or go back to urgent care (and if so, what would I even ask for?) Appreciate any insight or reassurance, thank you. ",1,1766243910.0,AskDocs,0,1.0,False

But with you, I don’t feel lost. I feel found.”They paused by a small lake, watching the water shimmer as a pair of ducks glided across the surface. Ceddy turned to face her fully now, his thumb gently tracing circles over the back of her hand.“I’m in love with you, Sierra,” he said, the words steady and clear. “Not just because you’re beautiful, or funny, or smart. I’m in love with the way you listen, the way you care about people, the way you see the good in me even when I can’t.”Sierra’s eyes glistened, her chest tightening in the best possible way. “Ceddy… I’m in love with you too.

As we were pulling out of the driveway the 15 miles wasn’t on there.  Being a HONDA owner previously, I know cars have a grace period (at least … reliable cars do) so we continued on to get to the nearest gas station. 1.mile.away!  We didn’t make it.  And the 15 miles that I had last night never showed back up.  I got one notification on the dash that I was low on fuel yesterday. I DID NOT get any notifications from my app like I have previously when low on fuel.  

Has anybody ever had notification errors? Or lack there of??  I also noticed today that my car didn’t alert my husband who was driving, that my seat belt wasn’t on as we were leaving the coffee shop. 

I’m getting concerned. This is a hybrid that is supposed to get 600 miles per tank.  I’m getting less than 400. My avg mpg is 23-25 despite my best efforts.  I know it’s cold out, and there is a break in period… supposedly. But I’m getting horrible gas mileage for a HYBRID!  Hell i think this is not good even for a Non-hybrid!

I'm sorry because this might sound incredibly confusing, so I'll keep it as simple as possible. Happy to add more detail in comments if needed.

But, basically, my friends and i have been friends with a Vietnamese guy for over a decade now. We were super close, especially me and him. we spoke to each other's families, too.

We all saved up and visited him in Vietnam after 7 years of not seeing each other.

But we missed all the signs.

Even in the trip, this dude was super strange. But we all thought he was a normal guy who was just acting weird.

For instance, we caught him standing naked in his room multiple times, blankly staring into a wall. And his door was always wide open, and he didn't realise we were there until after we had called out 2-3 times.

We also caught him aggressively talking to himself many times. He slept for 12-14 hours every day the whole month of the trip, randomly vanished for hours together, and always misplaced his keys. He also never remembered any house instructions and often fumbled (despite being vietnamese!) when ordering food at restaurants.

I thought he was in a bad space, offered to cover a few of his expenses during the trip, assuming it was money trouble (since he had confided in me that he had had some money issues earlier). I took him out to talk one-to-one on runs, drinks, coffee, meals, walks, etc. He was normal, friendly, and responsive. Sometimes, he ""glitched"" (like not answering or listening) but then snapped out of it.

But, after we left Vietnam, the dude started going nuts. He now believes he's an American intelligence agent, an Air Force guy, and that he's a spy in a ""war"". He believes our international friend group is something he ""infiltrated"" to steal information from ""the enemies"".

He's started posting crazy theories all over his socials about us, and is super angry, delusional, racist, and paranoid all the time. Btw, all this while, he's been obsessively online stalking a girl he spoke to like 11 years ago lost. She's terrified.

I know he's unemployed, and that his family depends on him. I, and a lot of his other friends, believe he's severely unwell mentally. I know which city he's from.

But are there any organisations or anybody we can contact at all for this?

I want him to get help and be safe, not harm himself or his family!",5,1766243516.0,VietNam,22,0.73,False

I’m looking for a slow burn 🔥 romance and would like to take the time to get to know people with the prospect of dating if things work out (if it doesn’t hopefully I’ll be able to gain a friend). 

A bit about me: 
- I’m 28, FilChi, and working in the health field. I’m from Metro Manila if that matters. 
- I’m a Christian (Protestant) and it’s really important for me to have similar beliefs in that aspect. (this is non-negotiable) 
- I’ve been single for 28 years (haha easy math) 
- Never had a book buddy and would love to read novels then discuss it. I usually enjoy crime/mystery/thriller/horror novels 
- I’m not the most active or adventurous but I do enjoy traveling and exploring places. 
- I really enjoy coffee and tea but am by no means an expert so it would be fun to explore cafes together
- I like taking photos on my phone to keep memories for fun 
- Love Language: Quality Time 
- Prefers to talk over chat 

A bit about you: 
- A Christian (born again or protestant as well) who does their best to put God in the center of their lives 
- Preferably someone older than me but willing to chat with someone younger as long as you qualify for the other things I’m looking for 
- Mature and is willing to engage in conversations and not just leave dry replies
- Respects boundaries and takes things slow (getting to really know each other first)  
- Looking for something long term and not just a fling 
- With goals in mind (long term or short term)…not everything has to be set in stone but it would be nice if you’re working towards some goal 
- Someone fit to encourage me to be fit as well haha

I’m a 21 year old guy in the Nashville area and it feels like most face-to-face social interaction happens at work, with family, or not at all. Especially if you’re broke and don’t enjoy bar-hopping every weekend.

I’m thinking about starting a Discord server for young adults in the greater Nashville area to make it easier to meet people and actually do things.

The idea:

A Discord to connect and chat

Monthly or bi-monthly low-cost meetups (coffee, parks, game nights, etc.)

If the group gets enough traction it could potentially develop sub-groups or spinnoffs (DND, Chess, Cooking, Etc)

Think “school clubs,” but without the school

Age-wise it would mainly be aimed at people in their 20s (roughly 18-28), but I’m not trying to be strict, more about shared stage of life than a hard cutoff.

Before I plan anything I’d like to see:

How many people would actually be interested in this?

What kinds of meetups would be interesting to the community?

Preferred platform for communication if not Discord?

Join the discord if you're interested,  It's still a work in progress but theres already a few people from the main Nashville subreddit

1prgi80,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1prgi80/unlearning_all_the_lives_ive_lived/,Unlearning all the lives I’ve lived…,"This space is for those who have been struggling trying to figure out where the hell you are going in life, with either no anchor, no sail, and or no compass. Forgive my grammar in advance I pretty much suck at writing but I want this to be real. 

Recently I started therapy, I should had long time ago but stereotypes from society at the time pushed me away. Actually I realized I had been allowing the thought of what others think of me rule my life for what seems like an eternity. I don’t want to sound like a victim here but I need a space to get this off my chest and I WANT it peer reviewed. (I know a lot of you will say some messed up stuff but some of you won’t and I’m looking for you). Nonetheless, I started therapy and I’ve come to the realization that I’ve grown into this bitter and anxious individual who is looking to get back to the golden retriever I used to be, where people would tell me I had a beautiful smile and a sweet laugh but now all I do is scowl and make dark jokes. 

I miss the person I was before life happened to me. Before ALL the lives I had to live to be where I m today. My therapist says I should try to find the positive, which is that I wouldn’t be where I am today if I didn’t live those lives. Today I live a moderately happy life, with a loving husband and baby, in a nice home in a quiet community. A life that which seemed like I would achieve at one point. So why am I trapped in these other lives when I finally made it to the goal? 

Trauma, from the age of 9 years old I had to learn how to be an adult in so many ways a child shouldn’t understand, not a 9 year old. Too many people failed me, told me to smile when I needed a hug, told me to stop crying and to think about everyone else before myself. My parent stopped parenting and instead I became their parent. 

How many of you also had to be your parent’s guardian before you were even a teenager? From 9 years old we became homeless, living on the street, out of cars, hoping homes of friends house (but never our actual family helped us). It wasn’t until I was 18 that I got myself out of that situation and joined the military. The kids around me I grew up with, either went to jail, prostitution, addiction, or they’re not here anymore… 

I’ve lost so many people trying to become a better person for myself. No one talks about that. During the time I was homeless, I was assaulted, pushed aside, victimized, scapegoated, constantly I was in a fight or flight mode. I cut ties with everyone who was associated with that part of my life who were not looking to better themselves. 

The older I got, the more I climbed, the less people from my past could follow. Now I’m approaching my 40’s and I do not have one friend, or one person (other than my husband) that I can call on to chat with or get a cup of coffee with, and I’m struggling with that. It’s hard making new friends, especially because I feel so desperate for friendship and the only thing running through my mind is that this person is probably thinking “what’s wrong with this person if they have no friends what did they do are they crazy” I.e myself. 

I spent a long time in a homeless shelter surrounded by 100’s of individuals, single mothers and their children, drunks, addicts (I’ve seen at least 4 OD’s before I was 16 in this shelter), prostitution, veterans, clinically insane who need to be on meds, just a melting pot of misfits that maybe a 9yr old shouldn’t had been exposed to but was and I believe that spending so long surrounded by so many people (good or bad) now that I have almost none it’s like I feel so alone. But when I was there I felt so alone, being in a room of 100 people but no one hears you speak or sees you standing there. 

This shelter was praised by media as a “holy hotel” of the sort and the pastor behind it all was a saint. That pastor only cared about money, that pastor allowed anyone to enter that shelter with no due process, he wanted to be Jesus himself. I’ve had scabies, bed bugs, abscess, you name it because of how disgusting this “CHURCH” shelter was. This main got praise while he fed us expired donated food, clothes that were never washed, the bathrooms had mold and people with sores all over their bodies would sponge bath in a sink I was suppose to brush my teeth in. 

Let’s fast forward, I lost the top row of my teeth from improper hygiene, (I have new teeth now thankfully). I can’t trust anyone and feel as though everyone has something out for me. When I try to get along with peers at work it’s like they no I’m different and treat me that way, even if I don’t share my life story which I tend not too but sometimes feel like I have to for someone to understand why I am a bit odd. So many times has it been used against me, where I’ve been the butt end of a joke behind closed doors. 

This has turned me into a fighter, I can be nasty, and well baby don’t like being put in a corner. I’ve lost jobs because of this. 

Therapy is unlocking a lot of these issues and helping me navigate the real problems behind it. But I’m afraid I’ll never have a good friend again, is it the end of the world? No, and I’m trying to learn to love the life I have now because it’s beautiful. But for some reason I am so unhappy with myself that the life around it, I guess just isn’t enough. 

I’m holding on, I’m angry, I’m sad, but I wanna fight this. So if you are out there, struggling with trying to unlearn all of the pain and the bullshit you’ve had to endure and you think you are alone, you’re not. This was a probably a long rant and I’m not gonna fix it, it is what it is so read it or don’t. ",2,1766243419.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

What tricks have you found that make AI actually think instead of just answering?

One of the hardest parts of growth and healing is operating in the space that feels completely **undefined**. We often get stuck because we look at the vast, blank canvas of our future and panic, thinking, 'If I don't know the destination, I can't take the first step.'

This feeling of being ‘undefined’ is exhausting because it robs us of structure. But you don't need to define the next five years, the next five months, or even the next five days. You just need to define *today*.

### Practical Tip: Define Your One Daily Anchor

When the universe feels messy and your direction is fuzzy, you need a single, non-negotiable point of control. This is your Daily Anchor. It's a micro-commitment that proves to your nervous system that you are still reliable, regardless of external chaos.

**The Rule:** Your Daily Anchor must be simple, 100% within your control, and take less than 15 minutes.

**How to Implement It Today:**

1.  **Identify the Minimal Viable Step:** Ask yourself: 'What is the absolute smallest thing I can do that would make me feel like I *did* something useful today?'
2.  **Make it Specific and Time-Bound:** Vague tasks fail. Anchor your action to a time or event.

**Examples of Effective Daily Anchors:**

*   **Movement Anchor:** Five minutes of stretching immediately after waking up.
*   **Clarity Anchor:** Writing down three things you are grateful for before touching your phone.
*   **Environmental Anchor:** Ensuring the kitchen sink is empty before leaving for work/ending the day.
*   **Nourishment Anchor:** Drinking 16oz of water first thing in the morning.

### The Power of the Anchor

When you consistently hit that one tiny, defined anchor, two amazing things happen:

1.  **Momentum:** That tiny completed task creates forward momentum. You start thinking, 'Well, I did that. What’s the next right thing?' (Even if that next right thing is just making coffee.)
2.  **Self-Trust:** You are rebuilding trust with yourself one tiny promise at a time. This confidence is the fuel you need to start tackling the bigger, undefined decisions later. 

Stop waiting for the fog to lift completely. Grab your Daily Anchor, and define your today.",1,1766242875.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False
1prgasu,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1prgasu/should_i_tell_him/,Should I tell him,"I’ve been hooking up with this MILF that works in the same building as for about a month. She’s never invited me to her place cause of the kids which I respect and she’s also never been over by me because of my kids because they in the same school.
This has been going for little over a month and it’s honestly been amazing. The sex is fantastic to say the least and there’s no commitment really so a win, win for me.
Anyway so two days ago I arrange a meeting with one of my biggest clients at a coffee shop as he is about to go on holiday and just wants a casual chat. Well I meet him there and meet his lovely wife of 18 years…. The Milf…. She told me her husband passed away a few years back… well I held my composure extremely well, she not so much as she immediately excused herself to go to the ladies….

Needles to say I sent her a text and told her we done.
Now do I tell him? He is my biggest client and if I tell him I’m either gonna lose him as a client or he might appreciate me telling him and stay my client…. I feel like shit, I would’ve never done anything if I knew she was married and the fact that it’s him makes it 10 times worse…

I feel I should tell him. I owe him that much.

Any advice?

I have a pretty detailed profile with the major dealbreakers listed and a lot about what my ideology is, things I enjoy and my dating intent (LTR). So there is usually a lot of compatibility. The flow is generally like this - we message a \*lot\*, often about some very deep subjects and it's not just me. Apparently my style draws people out; I get ""I rarely tell anyone this"" a lot. We do a phone call, sometimes a few, before meeting, usually for coffee or a beach walk or something. Sometimes that's followed up by more of a real date.

What happens next is usually along the lines of ""not really ready"" or sometimes finding something that would have been a problem sooner or later. It is usually broken off by the woman, but sometimes me. Then there is a little gap before the cycle starts over.

This has probably happened half a dozen times in the last couple of months. No overlap. Do the math. It's happened in as little as 4 days.

So I think I need to slow my roll, but I wonder if that's really so. Am I just saving time? I think I am scaring off a couple who might have been on board for something slower moving. I got exactly that feedback from latest, who is interested in still seeing each other with lower expectations and no guarantee of being exclusive yet.

The light was comforting. But something stirred in the dark like the cream in an old cup of coffee.
 
 This is where I would always wake up. My bed slick. Silently praying that this nightmare would end. My chest felt like a bass booming decreasingly heavy thumps. Cold sweat running down my brow felt like a river of fear. Feeling my eyes for remnants of sludge and finding nothing. Relief washing over me like a fresh shirt out of the dryer. I could relax.

I'm Alex (she/her), a 33 year old working professional from Germany. I'm asexual and looking for a romantic or platonic partnership that uplifts both of us.


**A little bit about me:**

I have two university degrees (law and economics) and enjoyed attending lectures at university. I really disliked school though. The more independent learning and studying in higher education suited me better.

When I have the time, I like to read. I recently enjoyed ""To the moon"" by Jang Ryujin (a fun read about female friendship at the workplace and how having financial freedom changes your perspective on your situation) and ""Days at the Morisaki bookshop"" by Satoshi Yagisawa (a sweet story about personal authenticity).
I'm learning Japanese (slowly little-by-little) to be able to read Japanese literature in the original versions.
I like to go on walks in nature.

I don't drink, smoke, do any other drugs or drink coffee (not because I think coffee is bad per se but because it's too bitter for me).
I don't enjoy parties, loud places or crowded spaces. 
I consider myself an introvert, but my job made me quite good (most times, we all have our off days) at entertaining conversations. I have a somewhat broad general (some people might say useless) knowledge about an array of topics, which definitely helps to connect with people and their interests. Social interactions are draining to me, however, and I do need considerable ""recovery"" time afterwards.

I'm not listening to music much these days because I found it effects my mood too much. When I want to be nostalgic, I listen to some of the old ""emo bands"" or older Green Day albums. I giggle when I see old Fall Out Boy music videos today, and then I think our generation can't be that bad, when we looked at those boys and decided, ""yes, those are the cool kids now"".
I'm also not much of a movie person, so the typical things people connect over or like to ask about (favourite song or movie) don't really apply to me.

I'm easily scared/made uncomfortable, so I mostly stay clear of scary, creepy or violent things.

I guess you could say I have a little nerdy streak, but I don't feel like I'm allowed to claim that label. I used to game (Skyrim and Final Fantasy). I watched all of Critical Role season 1 and some of seasons 2 and 3 (on YouTube, not the animated series on Amazon). I do enjoy anime and manga. I'm currently, very slowly, making my way through the Bungo Stray Dogs manga. The storylines are pretty unhinged but the characters are too real sometimes. 

I read tarot. If you believe that means I'm headed for the fiery place downstairs, we're not a match. If you think it's weird or unsettling or just not your thing, we're all good and I simply won't mention it again.

I'm quite wary of meeting in person. I will not agree to a meeting after only a few weeks of being in contact, even if we were quite close geographically. I would need enough time to know you well enough that I know what to expect should we meet in person.

In case you're wondering why I have an ""empty"" Reddit account: It's not a throwaway account to hide my other activities on Reddit. I don't use Reddit. The only subreddit I sometimes read through is the Duolingo one, because it's not always clear if the green owl is malfunctioning or if that's supposed to be the new update. This subreddit was suggested when I googled for places for asexual people to find potential dates/partners. So I made an account.

Below I made a short summary, so we can easily see if we might be a match or if we're definitely not compatible.


**What I'm looking for:**

* someone gentle and nurturing
* someone intelligent
* around my age
* has a good level of German and/or English
* if we find out that we're good for each other, it doesn't matter to me where you're located geographically; I'm open to LDR and online only


**What I'm not looking for:**

* financial support (I take care of myself in that regard.)
* someone to lament the state of the world/society/humanity/etc. with (I've already had too much of that in my life and I do not see that it impacted my life positively.)
* someone who needs someone to feel better about themselves or their life (I don't want you to need me, I want you to want me. And vice versa.)
* someone who thinks fighting in the sense of getting into heated arguments and raising your voice is a healthy or normal part of a relationship


**What I can bring to the table:**

* I will cheer you on when it comes to reaching your goals (career or personal, big or small)
* we can bounce ideas off of each other and help each other problem-solve or get new inspiration
* I can give you a little push when you can't find the motivation to keep pursuing something that you know is actually good for you
* frequent texting (within reason)
* honest feedback, including when you said/did something that upset me or that I think is not right
*willingness to learn together and from each other


**Things about me that could be deal breakers for you, so I'm going to be upfront about it:**

* My job is demanding and I work a lot. Weekends? (yes, quite regularly), on holiday? (yes, if something comes up), at 3 am at night? (yes, begrudgingly though). My schedule usually revolves around my work and I do not have the time to pour into a relationship that a person working a normal 9-5 has. Is that going to change? Not in the foreseeable future. I like my job.
* For the foreseeable future I'm not able to relocate.
* I don't want to have kids of my own.
* I've never been in a relationship.
* Even without taking sexual attraction into account, people still can have aesthetic preferences, so I might not be your type. I'm petite (162 cm and 49 kg), no curves, very fair complexion. People regularly assume I'm younger than I am.

If we should start exchanging messages, I will not ghost you later on. If I don't want to continue our conversations, I will let you know. If you don't want to stay in contact at any time, please don't hesitate to let me know either. I can assure you, I will not make a scene in any way, shape or form. I expect the same from you.

If you would like to connect, please write a little bit about yourself. (If your first instinct is to write an answer to this post, but then you start to talk yourself out of doing it ... please don't. There's probably a reason why you want to reach out.)",1,1766242299.0,asexualdating,0,0.99,False

While it may look like Italian pasta, it is actually a unique Japanese original inspired by Western flavors.

The Secret is in the Ketchup

The most distinctive feature of Naporitan is the use of tomato ketchup as the base sauce. Because of this, the balance of acidity is the key to its flavor:

• Too much acidity: If the sharp tang of the ketchup is too strong, children often find it difficult to eat.

• Mellow and Mild: When the acidity is cooked down properly, the sauce becomes incredibly creamy, mellow, and delicious. This sweetness is what makes it a favorite for all ages.

A Taste of Home

Naporitan is the ultimate ""soul food"" in Japan. There is no single ""correct"" recipe because the flavor varies from household to household. Every mother has her own secret touch—whether it’s adding a bit of milk, butter, or even Worcestershire sauce. For many Japanese people, it is the nostalgic ""taste of mom’s cooking.""

A Timeless Classic

Despite the arrival of authentic Italian pasta in Japan over the years, Naporitan has never gone out of style. It has been loved by Japanese people for many decades and remains a staple on menus today. It is a timeless classic that brings comfort and a smile to every generation.

The Golden Rule for Perfect Naporitan

To make the most delicious Naporitan, there is one secret technique: ""Pan-fry the ketchup before adding the noodles.""

Most people think of adding ketchup at the very end as a topping, but in Japan, we fry the ketchup in the pan along with the vegetables and meat.

• Why? Frying the ketchup evaporates the sharp vinegar and acidity.

• The Result: It transforms the sauce into a rich, sweet, and mellow glaze that coats the pasta perfectly.

This simple step is what makes the difference between a ""sour"" dish that kids might dislike and a ""mellow"" masterpiece that everyone loves!

1prft9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1prft9o/i_dont_really_know_how_to_have_fun_but_i/,I don’t really know how to have fun but I desperately want to,"To make a long story short, I’m the oldest of six siblings from a mom who struggled with substance abuse. I was always very withdrawn, a lot more than my sisters, and I’ve been diagnosed with Asperger’s, though I’d say I’m more high functioning, I just really struggle with eye contact and one on one interactions with strangers. I think once I know someone well enough it’s much easier. Sometimes when I’m in cafes I way overthink not looking at the baristas because I don’t want them to think I’m staring so even when they ask if I want more coffee I don’t look at them or glance at them for half a second to speak and I \*hate it\*. I wonder if it’s worse to be the customer who looks at you too much or the one who can’t bring himself to acknowledge you even when you’re talking to him.

Rebelling as a teen for me was less me sneaking off for parties and more me hiding mom’s keys so she wouldn’t go for a late night drunken joy ride and get killed. And if I was lucky her latest bf wouldn’t threaten to beat/shoot me. Whenever I’d be lucky enough for a girl to ask me out I could never bring her to my place but wouldn’t ever say why, and that sabotaged a few relationships. 

Every time I ever went to a house party or a bar with friends in college I could just feel myself draining the fun from the group and I hated myself for it. And so I just stopped going and declined invitations from my roommates to go out. I’d pretend I had an assignment and would just sit at home watching TV. 

I so badly want to be a fun person and I know inside I am. I seem like I’m stiff and wooden but I’m not. But I don’t know how to have fun. As stupid as it sounds, every time I’ve had a night out ahead of me I run it through in my mind of me being so fun and outgoing and then it rolls around and I’m quiet, people have to pry stuff out of me to engage in conversation and I hate myself for it. 

I want to be fun and I want to make people smile and laugh and be happy they know me and it kills me that it’s just not who I am. And it hurts me to know people who know me just know me as either the guy you don’t want at parties or just associate me with words like “reliable” or “responsible” or boring.

1prfsc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1prfsc2/type_me/,Type Me?,"I keep getting various answers on the enneagram tests online. Can you type me based on my answers? I'd love your thoughts on my possible typing, wing, and instinct stacking. Thanks in advance!

I'm 22F, cis and queer woman (about a 4 on the Kinsey scale). In terms of diagnoses to be aware of, I have C-PTSD.

Childhood—

I moved around, 5 times before I was 18, 3 different states and 3 different countries. Raised with Protestant father, Southern Baptist mother, non-denominational churches from 0-8, Southern Baptist church from 8-14, Catholic school from 9-16. I left the church when I was 14, fully rejecting organized religion, greatly due to Southern Baptist tradition/beliefs.

Career & Leadership—

I'm a student and researcher, I study multimodal communication, specifically nonverbal, such as gesture, body language, and movement. After grad school, I'd like to consult in negotiations and interrogation. I currently love it because I know I'm heading in the direction I want to go. Career aspirations involve working in high stakes, conversational environments, involving conversation and behavioral analysis. I would enjoy a leadership position in the respect, power, control, and delegation it involves. I'm definitely a leader who makes sure everyone is doing something they are good at and that advances whatever we're working on. Delegating comes naturally to me in terms of leadership positions. When I am able, I will help when someone requests it, although my level of involvement will be dependent on who the requester is and how much I care for them.

Free time & Activities—

Spending an entire weekend by myself in the cabin in the woods, sounds marvelously refreshing. Without other people, just being able to breath. However, spending an entire weekend to myself in a place where there are still people sounds terrible. I'd never be able to fully relax. I'm a dancer, all my life. It's relaxing to me on my own, as well as connecting when dancing with other people. I love being outdoors, I feel like I can breathe. However, I love a good, cozy coffee shop or library, where I can be alone with myself, just chilling. I'm definitely physically coordinated, as I'm a dancer and move my body on the regular. I love working with my body, hands, etc., especially in dance and in conversation. My hobbies include dancing, listening to music, reading, painting, writing, conversating. What I like about all of those hobbies is they connect me to people/humanity in various forms. I enjoy gleaning what I can from humanity, in as many ways, methodologies as I can. Highs in my life look like dancing and deep discussions with people; Lows in my life look like anxious-depressive spirals when my trauma is triggered.

Personality—

I'm a very curious, inquisitive person. I like to know what's going on, with people, with situations, dynamics, etc. People, their dispositions, their socializing, their connections and interactions with others are what interest me the most. I definitely have more ideas than I can execute, and ideas are about people interactions, impact and research, conversational and behavioral routes, data analysis methodology. I create art on the regular, in the forms of dance, writing, and painting (which depends on the phase in my life), but I'm always creating in some shape or form. I love consuming art, music, paintings, and writing in particular. I need logical consistency in life because life is always changing and the logic is a part of what helps me adapt. I enjoy controlling others as much as enjoying people controlling me, it all depends on the circumstances. It' about the power, and I prefer to have it completely out in the open, a direct understanding of control over someone else/ or someone else over me. Personal aspirations involve finding the things I wish to improve and continuing to improve them day by day; this is something I see as never ending, at least until I die. I fear not living my life, going to experience things, and living an overall dull life with no excitement or accomplishment. In decision making, I take my time analyzing the situation, and at the end of the day, I always trust my instincts and what I believe is most logical. I process emotions in the long run, it takes time. I don't open up about it as much, and I prefer to process on my own and very limited close friends/family. I am not someone who agrees with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going. I have authority issues, so I will most definitely challenge authority if I believe them to be faulty. In a blank room, I think about people, fantasies, and conversations.

Beliefs—

Past is where we once were, it informs the present, something we should keep in mind but not allow it to control us. Present is where we are/exist, something to be lived, experienced, it's also our opportunity to learn from the past and build up the future. Future is possibility, where we can go, something that allows us to take our past lessons, build upon it present actions, outputting a life we will be content with in years to come. Efficiency and productivity are very important to me; I lead a large part of my life subconsciously driving towards them all the time. I'm a meticulous strategizer, especially when having to do with personal goals and people. I always like having an outline and plan, but with enough room for adaptability when things inevitably don't go to plan.

For those that say ""no"" keep in mind we're both tryna focus on work after I asked her out in the same environment.

Given it is a larger cafe

Kinda a hard predicament. 

Or maybe it's not. Maybe i'm being a p\*\*\*\* and i should be grabbing digits left, right, front, and f\*\*\*ing center, taking a seat in the cafe like a beast and be texting them all later in the day as well. 

But i'm just not sure that would work out well lol. looking for the tactics from guys who also have this predicament because I know i'm not alone ",1,1766241171.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I was laid off from my teaching job so this has been an incredible adjustment after teaching for 10+ years (if you are a teacher you understand the rat race of a lifestyle that it is, and how your body goes into this weird mode when you all of a sudden don’t have all of those responsibilities). 

So needless to say I do all of the work during the day. My husband works 7-3:30. In the morning, he stays in the bedroom slurping his coffee and playing on the iPad, as I’m getting her up for the day. I’m offered no opportunity to do anything as he doesn’t believe that she needs to be supervised. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment and I’m told “we all live in the same household” when I ask him to just sit with her for a minute while I go to the bathroom. So I’ve stopped asking because im simply made to feel like I’m this overbearing mother when I ask for help. 

He states that he “ can’t help me with the night time feedings because he has to go to work “. I am bottle feeding, so it would be perfect for him to assist me at night as I am incredibly exhausted from being nonstop during the day. When he gets home he acts like checking bills is like a top priority so I can’t pass her off so I can take a much needed break.

 I get zero time for myself, only when she naps. Mind you her naps are only 20-30 minutes long. Then when she naps, if he is home is constantly dictates or “suggests” that I do things-from housework to stupid tasks that just aren’t a priority. If he sees me taking a second for myself to play my Nintendo switch or a game on my phone, he sighs loudly and makes it known that he’s annoyed. He doesn’t say anything, but it’s a subliminal noise to signal that I could be doing something more productive. I am struggling. Deeply. I feel like I’ve lost all sense of self. The only time I leave the house is to visit my mom down the road or go grocery shopping on the weekend, during which he constantly texts me and asks when am I coming back.

I really need to get an outsiders opinion, because from what I can see just after almost 6 months of this is that he is avoiding responsibility. I had to completely alter my life in every single way, but he is unwilling to do so and it isn’t fair. I am running on empty.

I know a lot of you were really zooming in on last round of photos and trying to figure out what was in that first box I’m not sure how to do this so maybe I do the group shot here and then take it one box or case at a time. I know it becomes kind of a find Waldo. 

For each pen, I’ll clean it and ink it and write something on paper so you can see the nib and how it writes and I’ll write a little thing about LIsa. I know her favorite pen was one. She called the eye of Sauron, but I’m not sure which one that is. I could probably guess. If anyone spots one that’s particularly interesting or rare or unusual or cool shout out and I’ll try to start with that. 

The one thing I’ll share about my friend is that my nickname for her was Captain underestimated because everybody tried to explain things to her or help her put her canoe on her car or carry her groceries and she was a total bad ass. She was so patient with people like that especially in areas where she was an expert. She would just let them finish and she would give them this look. The restraint was palpable. And she was very gracious and thanking them and declining.  

She was a paddle boarding instructor, a mountain bike instructor, she taught kids how to ride bikes. She had enough hours to be a dive instructor. She surfed and sailed and voyaged. She was an expert at camping and survival and lighting fires in downpours and crap like that. And she loved coffee. I think coffee was one of the few areas where she was judgy. And when we first met for coffee, I ordered a Cortado and I think I passed a test. 

She loved anybody who wanted to try anything new and was all about sharing whatever knowledge she had if asked. She’d always offered to help, but didn’t just jump in with unsolicited advice. She was a teacher at heart, I think. A storyteller. It was like she wanted to create stories with people by helping them learn something new nothing was theoretical. It was all applied and you got dirty and you got wet. 

And she love to write and sketch everywhere all the time on anything and treated ink like blood and notebooks like oxygen. ",259,1766240554.0,fountainpens,24,1.0,False

I’d been writing stories for decades — ghosts, trauma, the pink house, the blue umbrella — and yet the breakthrough didn’t come from a new plot twist or a clever metaphor. It came from something far less romantic: discipline.

I stopped waiting for inspiration to show up like some diva muse tapping me on the shoulder. Instead, I made it a routine. Coffee. Keyboard. Focus. Ten fingers on the battlefield, whether the words felt heavy or light.

And something strange happened: the more I treated my craft like a responsibility, the more freedom I felt. The more I learned to say no to drama, to distractions, to people who want your time but never offer their own, the more yeses I could give to the man I’m building.

The videos, the posts, the insurance business, the writing, people see the results now, and they call it “talent.” They don’t see the late nights filming alone in parking lots, editing until my eyes burned, or hitting delete on drafts that weren’t up to my standard. They don’t see the sacrifices, and I don’t need them to.

All I care about is this: I woke up today better than yesterday.
More focused.
More directed.
More dangerous in the pursuit of my own goals.

1prfeag,https://i.redd.it/8151twedbd8g1.jpeg,I modeled Constant Temp (104°F) vs. Setback (100°F) for a hot tub in winter. The savings are smaller than you might think.,"To follow up on my last post, I ran a thermodynamic simulation (Gemini Deep Think) to settle the debate: Is it better to keep the tub hot 24/7 or turn it down when not in use?

The Setup

• Tub: 290 Gallons, insulated cover.

• Weather: 40°F average ambient temp (Winter conditions).

• Scenario A (Constant): Held at 104°F continuously.

• Scenario B (Setback): Held at 100°F, heated to 104°F for usage 4x per week.

The Catch

The physics of water mass is brutal. While Scenario B saves energy on standby loss, you spend a massive chunk of that energy re-heating the water for the 4 usage sessions.

Wait Time:

In Scenario B, you have to wait \~43 minutes for the tub to go from 100°F to 104°F before every soak.

The Verdict

Unless you are on an extremely tight budget, Scenario B isn't worth it. You are essentially paying a ""spontaneity tax"" of $2.00/month to have the tub ready whenever you want it. If you drop the temp, you save the cost of a cup of coffee but lose the ability to jump in spontaneously.

TL;DR: Turning a 290gal tub down to 100°F only saves about 5% energy compared to holding it at 104°F, but forces you to wait 45 mins to use it.
