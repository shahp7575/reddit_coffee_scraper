Well, actually crocheting is but you’re a close second. What’s your favourite hobby? I would love to hear all about it? 

It’s kinda cold and grey today so I’m chilling at home. I’m a pretty open book and I hope you are too! 

Since “hi, how are you” is boring, I decided to make a list of conversation starters for us to help the polar bear break the ice:
- is supply chain boring to learn about? (Yes. Did I mention it in every interview despite not opening the book?…also, yes) 
- what’s your favourite chocolate? 
- what do you listen to while working? 
- do you use dairy or dairy alts in your coffee? (If you use dairy?? Free those baby cows tf?)

But like… what if there was a LI that had a normal wage? Or better yet. Poor af?? I read in one post that the new guy should just be some normal dude.

1jx1w2m,https://i.redd.it/85y4jvcc3aue1.jpeg,Filling my coffee machine water tank while making coffee.,"My Philips Lattego is wonderful but it has this annoying conception flaw where it does not know if there’s enough water to make your coffee.

I only drink long lattes with lots of milk, and quite often I forget to check the water level before pushing the button. But then… it’s too late. I have to wait until it’s empty, and the pouring stops, and I have to remove the cup, then remove the tank and go fill it, then put it back, put the cup back, and start again. 

This print enables me to fill the tank while the coffee is pouring. So no more « shit! Once again I forgot to check the water level before pushing the button » right after I push it. 

Thank you, 3D printing !

1jx1siv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1jx1siv/i_cant_tell_if_my_she_likes_me/,I can’t tell if my she likes me?,"Tl;dr: I have a crush on my best friend and I legitimately cannot tell if the feelings are reciprocated.

Hello all! Recently in January I went through a break up from a 2 year long relationship. My girl best friend, A, who I am very close to, was supported me very heavily through it. I have always had a crush on her, but out of respect for our friendship I distanced myself from her, and whenever I was in a relationship as to respect my relationship. 

Recently though, I have been catching some major feelings for her as we have been spending more time together. We have spent hours in her car just talking, there are looks that she gives me that just feel different, as well as how she laughs at/with me. 
These almost never happen when she is around her friends. They only happen when we’re alone together. There was one time though she put her leg on my leg and just looked at me. 

There was this time that specifically stuck out as odd, even if it wasn’t because she has feelings. 

A few months before the break up, I was feeling insecure about a celebrity crush my partner at the time had. Yes I know that’s immature but I can’t control it. My ex had broken a boundary I have about gushing over celebrity crushes in front of me. I was texting A, and jokingly said “if it wasn’t between me and (celeb crush) I would lose every time.” And she replied “no you wouldn’t, plus he’s old anyways.” I replied saying, “No even the old version. Also you’re just saying that because we’re friends” and she replied “No I’m not. And you’d beat the younger version too.” 

I’m sorry, but it felt like too much effort on her part to convince me that I would win against that celebrity crush. 

I have been having some friends who I view as sisters try and help me as they are also mutual friends of A. They are both older and I view them as mentors. One of them, said she had seen her giving me some “love glances.” I have had multiple people, including them tell me they can see it. I have invited her to eat at a local bakery with me and she agreed. But there are also times where she seems like she doesn’t have a crush on me. Granted, those are mostly around her friends. 

I have never had a larger crush on someone and this is killing me as I am legitimately uncertain of her feelings for me.  I have known her for 6 years and started having a crush on her 4 years ago. 

I apologize for the lack of organization but I am very anxious right now and the coffee I just had did not help.

1jx1s0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1jx1s0g/my_japan_tokyo_tips/,My Japan (Tokyo) Tips,"Hi all,

I figured since most people post their Japan travel tips, thought I’d give my 2 cents!

Me and my partner spent 9 days/8 nights in Tokyo. We stayed in Asakusa, but went to many different areas of Tokyo. Sorry this is a bit long but wanted to get everything I thought of across! Here’s my thoughts:

1. Everyone who says have Google Maps and Google Translate weren’t lying! Easily the best tools to have in Japan. 80%+ of my phone usage was navigating on Maps and using the camera feature of Translate. So easy!   

2. Know your basics in Japanese! We used konnichiwa, arigato gozaimas, and sumimasen literally all day every day. You can tell they really appreciate the effort, and it’s much more respectful! There were a FEW times you could tell they preferred you to speak to them in English, probably to practice their English, but most were very appreciative of you trying to speak in their language. Also, residents speak a lot less English than some people said, so be prepared to find other means of communication quite a bit.  

3. Public transit was very easy. We are fortunate that we have a great transit system where we are from (BART) which I do think made it even easier for us to use, but even if you don’t, it’s not hard to figure out at all! All of the trains also have signs and announcements in English, which makes it even easier. The hardest thing was navigating the exits, but Google Maps helps with that. Also! If it’s a square with the line name starting with a J, it’s a JR train. If it’s a Circle with a letter, (A, G, KK, etc), it’s a Tokyo Metro or Toei Subway train.   
 
4. Speaking of Transit, Suica is awesome! For everyone having trouble preloading a card on Apple Wallet, I had the same issue. But what I figured out is if you download the Suica app and create a card/load it that way then put that card on your Apple Wallet, it works fine, even if you load before you come. Note thought that the app is only in Japanese, so you’ll have to translate it somehow (I used the Camera on Translate on my partners phone to navigate the app). Also, there are two points you will have to put your name in when creating an account and a card. On the second time, you’ll have to enter the Japanese version of your name as it doesn’t accept English names. But I preloaded before I came no problem with the app and it let us get right on the train from the airport. Note though that if you want to load in cash, you’ll have to wait and get a card when you arrive as you cannot load the mobile card with cash in most places. We ended up getting physical Suica cards too due to that, but still. Also! The Suica cards can be used to pay for SO much stuff here! Kinda works like a reloadable debit card! Super cool!   

5. People are right that trash cans are pretty few and far between. There are bottle/can recycling at a lot of the vending machines, (which are EVERYWHERE btw), but regular trash cans are pretty hard to come by. Be prepared to carry your trash. I brought a backpack with me most places, which was a great decision for trash, coats, storing our purchases, etc.   

6. My partner is vegetarian, and there were some people to said it would be difficult to eat here due to that. I’m happy to report that was not the case. Sure, it’s maybe even 5 restaurants you encounter that have veggie options, but I would not say it was difficult. Best ones that are easy to find were Kura sushi, T’s TanTan for ramen, and CoCo Ichibanya. The first and last ones are chains so maybe not as “authentic” as you can get, but were very delicious nonetheless. Also Tokyo style pizza is amazing! Also also, the coffee at Doutor chain was delicious lol.  

7. The hotel we stayed at said, like a lot of non-American chain hotels in Japan, would have super hard beds. I wouldn’t say the beds were SUPER hard, but we did pack a mattress pad in our luggage just in case. That was the right decision! Also, the rooms were very small. This could’ve been just our hotel, but in general Japan is not made for big and tall Americans. I’m tall, not big, but still had to duck my head a lot in the city lol. If you are used to big American hotel rooms, don’t be surprised when you show up to a non-American chain hotel and the rooms are very small. We made it work, but be prepared! We did love our hotel though, and the staff were very kind and accommodating.     

8. We went to: Asakusa (where we stayed), Ueno park, Shibuya, Akihabara, Kawasaki/Kanamara, Yoyogi Park, SKYTREE, and Omotesando. I can recommend all of them! They were all fun! Omotesando is probably the one I would recommend the least unless you want to do very upscale shopping, but it was still pretty and the architecture is beautiful there. Shibuya and Akihabara were both very crowded though so be prepared for that. Also, please be respectful, read the signs, and follow directions. If it says no pictures, don’t take pictures. In trains, be quiet and mindful of your space. In shrines, don’t disrespect the space. Remember, you’re a guest in the country!! Also also, bring comfy walking shoes. We walked sooooo much and if I would’ve worn the wrong shoes, I’m sure my feet would be destroyed.  

9. Shopping was cool! Don Quijote (big box-esque chain) and the Shibuya shopping centers were the most fun. We personally didn’t think tax free was very worth it most of the time, most stores require at least 5,000 yen plus to do tax free. Unless you’re buying a bunch of very expensive things, it’s not really worth it. The only times we did tax free were for our souvenir purchases when we knew we were buying a lot at once. Also, again we’re from the States, and tbh, the electronics were NOT cheaper here. In fact, most were actually more expensive than I could get in the states.   

10. Food and public transit are very cheap here compared to the States. Like, very cheap. Also, we exchanged our money at our bank (Chase) before we left. Best exchange rate and fees we could’ve gotten, and it only took 3 business days to get our money. Do this if you can. We personally took 75,000 yen, which was definitely enough. Still bring a card with you though because we did run into some places, especially in Shibuya, that were cashless and required a card. I personally used my Apple Card for most things that required a card. Also, don’t tip. Don’t even try. They will give you the money right back. Incidentally though, this makes it even cheaper compared to the States.  
  
11. Last and random one. We flew ANA… one of the best plane experiences I’ve ever had. The flights were smooth, and the staff were SO friendly and helpful. If you can fly them, do it!  
  
Overall, one of the best trips I’ve ever taken. If you’re thinking of going to Japan, do it!! I hope this helps! I’m happy to answer any questions as well!",3,1744408633.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.8,False
1jx1rtb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx1rtb,My love for Dust Kitties runs deep.,"I'm a retired veterinary technician. I have adopted and fostered so many cats over the decades. But the 1st cat that I fell totally in love with was a little old lady that I scooped up of the street one day.  Pics 7 & 8 are of her.  

After she died (heart failure), I never wanted to forget her.  So I adopted several old dust kitties over the years who had the same spicey attitude and needed a home.  

Then I fostered a couple of spicey dust kittens who were brought into our clinic only a couple days old.  The boy preferred the company of dogs so he went to a family with a pit bull.  I only adopt difficult cats with difficult problems but I made one exception for the little girl.  

Harriet is turning 18 next month.  She is getting to the age of that 1st dust kitty that I scooped up ~ 1998.  I can't believe how much time has gone by.  I have always treated Harriet like she is the most important thing in the world.  

I really hope that I outlive her.  It scares me what might happen to her if I'm gone. Would she end up in the streets like Little Miss Hissy? (the 1st dusty from 30 years ago)

Pic 4 is there to show how she casually dips her tail into my coffee.  She does this all of the time.  This can't be an accident. ",3,1744408617.0,dustkitties,1,1.0,False

I am so sick of coffee shops that are so self-important that it forgets its purpose… to serve good drinks based on their menu the way people would like.\
I went to a local coffee shop today that has very interesting roasts and blends, specifically one with heavy strawberry notes, for their drip coffee. 
I ask the barista if I can get a drip coffee but on ice, and they told me “we have cold brew!” 
No. I don’t *want* a cold brew at this time. It tastes totally different. I don’t want an iced latte today, that’s espresso based.\
I realize that adding ice would dilute the flavor a bit since they don’t chill their drip coffee. I’m OK with that because I wanted a not hot drip coffee beverage today.\
The barista looked at me like I sprouted two extra heads. So I bought the damn $6 12oz cold brew to not cause a disturbance… even though politely asking for something a certain way should be no different if I ask for another milk type.\
Furthermore, this shop has other iced drinks, including specialty cold foams and mixtures and matcha and what not. The barista could have done it, but clearly did not want to. 
It’s a coffee shop, calm down y’all.

1jx1o9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jx1o9b/i_think_i_choose_the_wrong_course_and_feeling/,I think I choose the wrong course and feeling anxious all day,"To begin, I want to give some context about my life. I’m 19 years old and currently studying Agronomy at a prestigious public university in another state.

Throughout my life, I’ve always had a deep, almost obsessive interest in all forms of art. When I was younger, I loved drawing and painting. In early adolescence, I became obsessed with cinema, and over the past three years, I’ve grown passionate about music and poetry.

My family is financially well-off. On my mother’s side, we have leased farmland that guarantees a steady income—about R$50,000 a month—far above Brazil’s minimum wage of R$2,000. My father is a real estate agent and also well-off. I’ve always had everything handed to me. I never had to work for anything, and though my parents did this out of love, I now realize how it negatively impacted my personality.

My parents are divorced, largely due to my mom’s personality. She’s a successful architect but tends to take life lightly, which often makes her seem irresponsible and disorganized—even to me sometimes. This clashed with my father, who’s the exact opposite: organized and methodical. They ended things peacefully, but the contrast was clear.

My father never hit me, never yelled at me—honestly, he’s a great person: honest, hardworking, and very caring toward me and my brother. But the divorce, which happened when I was a kid, made me see him as harsh because he’d criticize my grades and push for discipline. He’d also comment on how I dressed and how quiet I was. My mom, on the other hand, was always open with me and really understood me. She never demanded anything, which taught me to learn from real-life experience. That helped me become very self-aware, but it also caused anxiety and made me approach life too casually—something she often encouraged by saying “it’s all okay.”

This created massive anxiety whenever my dad criticized me. For a time, just seeing his name on my phone made my heart race—even if he was just calling to talk. Report card days felt like being chased by a lion, even if the worst that happened was a stern talk or a short punishment. My escape was my mom, who always took my side. This went on from about age 10 to 15.

Around 16, I started to mature and slowly understand my dad’s perspective—that life does require discipline. My mom’s carefree attitude caused real issues too, like unpaid bills and hidden debts—not because she couldn’t pay, but because she was disorganized. Living with her became nearly impossible, even though she’s a kind, open-minded, and in many ways, wise person. I also realized that my dad’s concerns came from love and fear of leaving me unprepared for life. Most of the problems he pointed out were valid and came from my own irresponsibility. So I began trying to change.

But the more I tried, the more I felt pulled back into my mom’s “light” way of living. I couldn’t study without hearing her voice in my head saying I should only do what I love—my artistic passions—and not pressure myself. At the same time, “reality,” represented by my dad, would hit me with reminders that if I didn’t study, I’d end up a bum.

I’ve always had a very romantic view of life. I rarely get stressed. Honestly, in the last three years, I can’t remember many times I was truly upset. My mom taught me to always consider others’ perspectives, and now I find it almost impossible to hate anyone. The only person I ever hated growing up was my dad—but even that has faded (thankfully). My life has been peaceful, I always did what was convenient, and I never set expectations for anything. When others placed expectations on me, I panicked.

The biggest of these panic moments came when I decided—with a friend—to move over 1,800 km away to study Agronomy. Originally, I wanted to study Architecture, but several things pushed me away from it:
	1.	The pressure on architects today to promote themselves on social media, something I’d hate to do.
	2.	The profession is currently undervalued.
	3.	My dad, indirectly and without meaning harm, discouraged me.
	4.	I was terrified of being unemployed and living off inheritance—like my two cousins, who don’t work and just live off family money, which could run out at any time.

So I chose Agronomy. Since I have land, it made sense to learn how to manage it. I saw it as a career that would allow me to work while also having time for my hobbies. With my inheritance, I could fund my creative interests.

That was my real mindset—accepting that living off my artistic passions in Brazil would be nearly impossible.

I passed the entrance exam, moved in with my friend, and my family spent a lot of money renting and furnishing a new apartment. Then classes started—and on the first day, I wanted to quit.

I’ve always believed in studying what you love. But as soon as I saw the first biology lecture, with topics like cells and ribosomes, I realized I needed genuine motivation and interest to study seriously. My attraction to Agronomy was mostly about an idealized lifestyle—contributing to society while still having time for my passions.

I also have this fear that I’m at the only age when I can master something. I think that after 25, it’ll be too late. So during lectures, all I can think about is how I could be reading, playing guitar, writing poems…

The same childhood anxiety came rushing back. I wanted to quit and hinted that to my mom, who said “it’s fine”—and I know she meant it, but I also know it’s not fine. I’ve spent both her and my dad’s money, and my friend partly moved because I was coming too.

It’s been about a month and a half. Exams are coming. Sometimes I get motivated, thinking about the life I could build if I return home. Other times, I feel like I’m abandoning my artistic self. Between classes (it’s a full-time program), I rush to a bakery and spend hours just drawing, writing, drinking coffee—trying to gather energy to go back to campus. That’s time I should be using to study, and I know I’m going to pay for that soon.

The apartment lease is for a year, so I have to stay at least that long. But I keep cycling through this thought loop:

“Just relax, it’s only a year—then you can go home.”
“But if I’m leaving in a year, why bother dedicating myself now?”

I still don’t know if I actually hate the course. According to older students, the first semester is the most boring and things get better later. Still, I can’t picture myself working for a company or anything like that. Honestly, I still hold onto this image of life shaped by movies and media—of young, reckless people who adapt to any situation (like Rebel Without a Cause, Into the Wild, or even figures like Bob Dylan, who’s been an obsession of mine for the past three years).

I feel like I won’t be happy as an adult because adulthood demands constant responsibility and confidence. I hate when people ask me questions—and the idea that I’ll be seen as an “expert” one day terrifies me.

The woman is very nice, a bit absent-minded, sensitive, and closed-minded, but kind-hearted. She's about 45 years old; unfortunately, she wasn't able to have children. She had a low fertility rate, and her partner (who was 20 years older than her) didn't want more children (he had with another marriage if i’m not mistaken) even though she could have undergone treatment, but then it was too late. She has two pets: a parakeet and a dog. She adores her dog, and good for her, honestly, love pets they’re the kindest souls on earth. We all have a soft spot for pets and spoil them, but hers is pretty extreme. She bathes her monthly, talks to her as if she were a baby, a human baby (I understand baby talk but she demands answers from the dog as if she would understand her) and even calls her “my human dog”, every night she feeds her, she doesn’t throw the food in her bowl or anything, she boils the meat and gives it to her in her mouth because the dog is so spoiled that she can’t eat alone (the dog), even if we are at the table she puts the dog on the chair (she is from a small breed) and says “My poor little girl, everyone is eating and you are not” in baby talk. What led me to make this post is that she arrived home at 4:45 pm and since then she did not stop kissing her until 5:25 (I took the times from messages that I sent and related them) the only time she stopped was when my dad arrived (mind you, without cleaning her lips she kissed my dad ON THE LIPS) and then he made coffee, they drank together and she continued kissing her, two minutes later she was kissing the parakeet, I felt super uncomfortable and I left the living room to my room because I didn’t want to hear those sounds, my father and I have talked about this, but talking to her about any “defect” of hers is like my dad and her getting into a fight because she doesn’t accept constructive criticism or questions.

I’m 27F, I weigh 120lbs at 5’7”, I’ve been vegan for 8 years, and I exercise mostly daily. I also don’t drink or do recreational drugs, except share a joint with friends once or twice a year. I had an emergency appendectomy 1.5 years ago via laparoscopic surgery, and it’s healed totally fine. 

Two weeks ago, at around midnight, I suddenly got this tight pain in my upper abdomen, right between the bottom of my ribs and about an inch above my belly button. It got worse and worse, and 15 minutes later I was dry heaving and then vomiting. The pain subsided slowly after that. I hadn’t eaten anything weird or suspicious or done anything out of my normal routine. Then, 4 days ago, at around 10am, the same thing happened, only this time while I was at the coffee shop next to my apartment. I came home and threw up pretty much just bile. I hadn’t eaten anything that day yet or had my coffee even. 

After the second I started to worry about this pattern. But now that it’s happened again today, I’m really worried. Around 2pm, sudden onset pain in the same exact way, 15 minutes later I’m in the bathroom throwing up. I felt completely fine minutes before, and then afterwards it takes like 1hr for the pain to subside. I didn’t even feel the sense that I had thrown up “enough” or “all of it”.

I took a few pregnancy tests (all negative) and I have a hormonal IUD anyway. 

I’ve been under a lot of stress lately at work so I chalked it up to that, but it seems more random than stress could account for. I’m moving across the country in a few weeks and have been dealing with anxiety associated with that, but these episodes come on in random, peaceful, normal moments. 

Any ideas? I have an appointment with my doctor but it’s not until the end of this month, and I have to go on a business trip next week which I’m worried about getting randomly sick on. ",0,1744407982.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

She will be watching a movie and wakes me up all throughout, I don’t sleep for long usually just enough for me to not feel that way, when I wake up I’m tired but not in the same way I was when I laid down.Her room is baby proofed and I don’t bring food in the room so she can’t choke but I don’t like falling asleep like this but I have to lay down and it feels like really really need sleep. If I close my eyes , I will eventually just succumb to the sleep feeling.Then I wake up, sometimes realizing I drooled and didn’t realize cause I was so out. Even if it’s a few minutes. If I fight the sleep feeling, I’m sitting on the couch or bed for hours. Trying to keep myself awake. I remember when she was really little I laid in the floor with her and wanted to fall asleep so bad I kept dozing and waking myself up. I’ve gotten double vision with it before. I’ll go to text and the text has little shadows behind it. That’s when I realized I also have double vision sometimes with my what I call my “sleep attacks”. Coffee and caffeine don’t help.

I (29F) have been dating my boyfriend (32M) for 8 years now. We started dating in undergrad and things were great. The first few years of our relationship were really carefree and fun, and we spent a lot of time hanging out with friends. We also were pretty close to my family as he had pretty tense relationships with his siblings and dad. Around year 3/4 we moved in together and adopted a dog. He refused to pay for anything besides the bare necessities for the apartment, but at that time I didn’t care and just bought things for our apartment out of my own pocket (including all of our furniture, caveat that I got our couch for free from family). I didn’t think much about him not wanting to pay because he wasn’t making much at the time. All throughout this time, my bf was so affectionate and was always doing nice things to make me feel loved. He would plan date nights for us, get flowers every once in a while just because, would pick out nice thoughtful gifts for birthdays and holiday, and would always want to do things with me and include me in his friend group and when he did go to see his family. At the end of year 4, I quit my job and started law school. We discussed it beforehand, and I took out loans to cover most of my living expenses. The only thing we agreed would be different is that he would pay for the majority of groceries. In practice, it was probably around a 60/40 split with groceries, and I always contributed as much as I could until my loan money ran out. At this time, I also paid for all apartment-related items like wardrobes, a bed frame, and storage cabinets as we moved to a bigger apartment. While I was in law school, I started to notice a change in the way that he treated me. By the time I was in my last year of law school, he wasn’t planning any dates for us, was consistently complaining that I don’t cook dinner for him (despite me cooking 2-3 nights a week and when I would ask why he couldn’t cook for 2-3 nights to round out the week, he would say he prefers to just meal prep his food for himself (but then never actually did it)). He stopped putting efforts into birthday and holiday gifts, and wouldn’t buy anything unless I would send a link to something I wanted. This past birthday, he waited a whole month after my birthday (following me making comments about it) to get me anything. He never gets flowers, and doesn’t invite me to hang out with his friends or family. Now that I’m out of law school and working, he refuses to pay for any groceries or food/coffees that we order out because he says it’s my turn to pay for things (keep in mind he wasn’t buying 100% of these things while I was in school). He uses up more than half of the space in our wardrobes and storage spaces that I had bought and when I ask him to move some of his stuff so I can use my half of the space, he makes a stink about it. If I plan something for us to do (for example, on the first warm day this year, I made plans in advance with him to bring our dog to the park and have a picnic), he bailed on me the morning of saying he actually wanted to work on his car instead. My job is pretty demanding hours-wise and I’m often on my computer 14-18 hours a day. He still asks me why I don’t cook dinner for him, and says that buying dinner doesn’t count for anything. He started having a closer relationship with his father and brother, who are both extremely conservative in their family dynamic thinking, which is what I think is fueling my bf’s focus on me not cooking dinner for him. We have also been talking about getting engaged and starting a family together for a few years, but every time I’ve brought it up, my bf will be pretty cold and avoid the question. I’ve also gained about 20 pounds, mostly from stress eating during law school and then living a very sedentary lifestyle since working) and he takes every opportunity to tell me I’ve gained weight, that I have a square butt now, or that I’m fat now. He doesn’t ever call me beautiful or make me feel good about myself. Our sex life has pretty much gone nonexistent because I feel self conscious around him. At this point, I’m almost 30 and am feeling like I’ve wasted a big chunk of my life. We have had many discussions but he doesn’t handle confrontation well and deflects the conversation to avoid talking about what I’m upset about. I still love him and still want a future with him, but I feel like I would be settling and maybe even disrespecting myself due to the way he has grown to treat me. Two questions - do you think someone is likely to change back to the way they used to be (in terms of treating me better and being affectionate and loving) ; and two,do you think I would be settling if I held out with the hope that things get better? I’m at this crossroads where I imagined my whole future with this one person, but also feel like I don’t have a ton of time to wait on him because I genuinely wanted to settle down and start a family soon.

Almonds are not only a nutritious snack but also a [**sleep**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/smart-ways-to-sleep-better-and-wake-up-energized/) hero. They’re rich in magnesium, a mineral that improves sleep quality by reducing inflammation and regulating melatonin levels, the hormone responsible for your sleep-wake cycle.

A small handful of almonds before bed can give your body a boost of nutrients it needs to relax and prepare for sleep.

# 2. Kiwi

This delicious green fruit is a powerhouse of sleep-inducing nutrients. Kiwis are high in antioxidants like vitamin C and serotonin, which have been linked to improved sleep duration and efficiency. A study also found that eating two kiwis an hour before bedtime helped participants fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.

# 3. Chamomile Tea

While technically a drink, chamomile tea deserves a spot on this list. Packed with powerful antioxidants and apigenin—a compound that binds to receptors in your brain and promotes sleepiness—this tea is a relaxing choice before bed.

# 4. Fatty Fish

Salmon, mackerel, and tuna aren’t just good for your heart—they’re also fabulous for your sleep. Fatty fish are rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients work together to regulate serotonin production, enhancing your [**mood**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/exercise-energy-and-mood-understanding-the-connection/) and sleep cycle.

# 5. Bananas

Bananas are full of sleep-supporting nutrients like magnesium and potassium. These minerals relax your muscles and nerves, reducing physical tension that could keep you awake. Plus, their natural sugar content can help trigger serotonin production.

# 6. Tart Cherries

Tart cherries are among the few natural sources of melatonin. Drinking tart cherry juice or snacking on dried tart cherries before bed has been shown to improve both sleep duration and quality.

# Foods That Disrupt Your Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/ev086sm9y9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6689ffd9bb2e60510ea5d34c42ebe7bcb5c1bd

While some foods help improve your sleep quality, others can do the exact opposite. Here are the main culprits to avoid for a peaceful night:

# 1. Caffeine

It’s no surprise that coffee is a sleep disruptor, but caffeine hides in other foods and beverages, too. Soda, chocolate, and even some teas can keep you awake. Caffeine is a stimulant that blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Its effects can last for hours, so cut caffeine at least six hours before bedtime.

# 2. Spicy Foods

Foods like spicy curries or hot sauces may taste amazing, but they can wreak havoc on your sleep. Spices can cause heartburn or indigestion, especially when eaten close to bedtime. Plus, they can raise your body temperature, making it harder to fall asleep.

# 3. Alcohol

Although a glass of wine might make you feel drowsy initially, alcohol disrupts REM sleep, the most restorative sleep stage. It can also lead to frequent wake-ups during the night, decreasing your overall sleep quality.

# 4. Sugary Snacks

Candy bars, cookies, or other sugary snacks can spike your blood sugar levels. This not only makes it harder to fall asleep but may also cause you to wake up during the night as your blood sugar crashes.

# 5. Fried or Fatty Foods

Greasy foods like fried chicken or cheesy fries are difficult to digest. Eating them late at night can lead to indigestion and discomfort, keeping you awake when you should be catching Z’s.

# 6. High-Salt Foods

Too much salt before bed can lead to dehydration and disrupt your body’s fluid balance. This could cause you to wake up in the middle of the night, thirsty or with an elevated heart rate. Salty snacks like chips or processed foods are best avoided before bedtime.

# Sleep-Friendly Eating Tips

https://preview.redd.it/nbekisgby9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a2ac43df2baecf1a66475d3f20f2f32cb7745db

Besides knowing which foods to eat and avoid, following these practical tips can further improve your sleep:

* **Time Your Meals:** Avoid heavy meals two to three hours before bedtime. A light snack is fine, but eating large meals too close to bedtime can cause indigestion.
* **Balance Blood Sugar:** Pair complex carbs (like whole-grain crackers) with protein (like peanut butter) to stabilize your blood sugar levels and avoid waking up hungry.
* **Consistent Routine:** Try to eat meals and snacks at roughly the same times each day. A consistent food schedule can help regulate your body clock.
* **Stay Hydrated:** While drinking water throughout the day is essential, try to limit fluids close to bedtime to avoid waking up for bathroom trips.

# Why Food Impacts Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/baetba9ey9ue1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ebfdc942068addf740bee5efeb8a669af032468

# 

You might be wondering, *Why does what I eat matter so much for sleep?*

The answer lies in the complex relationship between food, hormones, and your body’s circadian rhythm—or internal clock. Certain foods boost the production of serotonin and melatonin, hormones that tell your body when it’s time to sleep and wake up.

On the other hand, stimulants like caffeine, sugar, or heavy meals interfere with these hormones or your body’s physical comfort, sabotaging restful sleep.

# Sleep Better Tonight by Choosing Your Foods Wisely

The connection between food and sleep is powerful. By choosing the right snacks and avoiding the wrong ones, you can set yourself up for a more restful night and wake up feeling refreshed.

Well I used to drink like 4 or 5 cups of coffee daily to help me get through the day along with smoking cigarettes 

After that panic attack though I have stopped caffeine cold turkey and for some reason I now can no longer smoke tobacco without getting a panic attack

I left everything cold turkey but then started getting these unbearable cravings for a cigarette to where I felt it in my neck!!!!!

I took some puffs of a cigarette and felt a little better but still not enough because I smoked like a pack a day so I needed more to get my fix

Well I found out that cigarette withdrawals are horrendous and they cause extreme anxiety anger and emotional roller coasters and that's exactly what I've been going through since I stopped smoking as I used too!!!!

 I don't know what to do now because I cannot smoke cigarettes without having anxiety attack and if I don't smoke a cigarette my anxiety attack goes through the roof to where I need an ambulance 

Only thing helping at the moment is letting the smoke hit the back of my throat then I puff it lit but I still don't feel like I'm getting that hit that I need

My niece is like 5 so very into princesses and mermaids and treasure and her and my nephew remind me of my sister and I so much I just wanted to put together an interesting gift.

 I got the treasure chest in our touristy coast town of Galveston, kinda bummed me out because when i was a kid they sold like, authentic looking treasure chests, little smaller than this but they came lined with velour and had little chains on the hinges and all the riveting looked realistic and functional. I looked and looked even the ones online weren't good enough for me lol

This one is basically just balsa wood with the rivets glued on. Soooo, super unhappy with the chest but i found some nice velvet at walmart and upholstered the velvet to some really thick cardboard and also some egg carton foam and lined the inside of the chest, and also tossed some incense dust inside under the foam to give it a little bit of a mysterious aroma instead of glue smell. The kaleidoscope isn't the *best* quality but it does what it's supposed to,  has a sweet inscription and hopefully the box stays together for a few years to come and I can keep mailing her treasure and marbles in the future. 

The stuffed cthulu animal i got at the local punk rock garage sale and i tried to get the vendors info but I realized they're just a reseller they didn't have any info on the maker. I just liked the green and purple composition and it kinda looks like grogu which we had watched together when she was younger. Anyway just wanted to share!

Everything I've gained since leaving:

1. Many beautiful friends who I can know actually care, and an ability to have real connections (meet and befriend people different than me)

2. A love for life with all it's highs and lows, and an ability to live it to it's fullest (there's no longer an eternity to procrastinate living right now in the present)

3. Freedom from shame and guilt

4. Freedom to do things for myself

5. More Money (obviously)

6. Curiosity and freedom to ask questions without fear of judgement and giving judgement

7. Communication skills

8. A fulfilling job I would've never considered applying for as a Mormon

9. A newfound independence and autonomy

10. A smile that's there more often than it's not

11. An unfaltering confidence

12. A growth-oriented mindset and the room to realize how far I've come, and how far I can go! (and holy hell how much i've grown since I stopped believing that there's ""objective"" truth)

13. Open-mindedness to new experiences and opinions (kick bias to the curb)

14. A greatly increased appreciation for art! (I mean have you seen a good rated R movie or listened to a solid album that your parents would've grounded you for had they caught you?)

15. Grace for myself and others

16. A fixed relationship with sexuality

17. A new coffee and tea addiction (because soda is *disgusting*)

18. An ability to be vulnerable and talk about anything and everything

19. Way more time to do things and relax; I gained a whole Sunday (""Day of Rest"" my ass, who else was just stressed out every Sunday?)

20. Freedom from social pressures (Get your degree, get married, have kids, etc. etc.)

21. An ability to say ""No""

22. Less social anxiety (I always thought I was an introvert until I left the church. i definitely don't anymore!)

23. A closer relationship with my family (Weird, right? However, if I hadn't left, it'd all still be small talk and fake smiles. Suddenly, real things started to enter the conversations)

24. Freedom to **feel** and to **heal**

25. Freedom from the idea of a ""Path"" (Everyone crafts their own!)

26. Freedom from ""good"" and ""evil"" (We're just people)

27. Freedom to love unconditionally

28. Freedom to be loud, unapologetic and express individuality

29. Freedom from expectations and comparison

30. Freedom from external validation and ""money mindset""

31. Freedom to do real charity

32. Freedom to die (""eternity"" is an escape from death. Everything changes when you know you're going to die)

  
On the supposed ""One true path to happiness"" I found nothing but repression, depression, and oppression. 

The supposed ""sparkle in the eye"" that all LDS members believe they have, I never had until I left. 

It took years to find all these things after leaving, and if you're still in that process, enjoy the journey! There's no timeline. There's no deadline. You'll get there in your own time, and no one elses. 

As much as it's great to complain, I hope you all find something to be grateful about today! God bless all you heathens

1jx0vub,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArianaGrandeSnark/comments/1jx0vub/i_think_the_reason_i_dislike_her_so_much_is/,I think the reason I dislike her so much is because she reminds me of the worst version of myself.,"Food contamination and husband fucking is unforgivable no matter what, I want to get that out of way before I proceed. 



All of that aside I see a lot of myself in her (or did when I was a version of myself I hated) 



- I had no identity or sense of self. My entire personality was pieces cut from other people and poorly sewn together to form this Frankenstein personality that didn’t belong to me. The reason Ariana shifts personalities and accents so much is because she’s doing the same thing. Emulating the traits of everyone around her because she doesn’t know who she is. 



- I needed male validation to see worth in myself. It wasn’t enough to think I was pretty, I needed men to tell me I was pretty. If men weren’t flirting with me or showing interest I took that as I’m not desirable. To boost myself up I would flirt with men even if I didn’t like them, just so I could get reciprocation and feel like I was worth something. This is a core part of who Ariana is, she NEEDS male validation because she doesn’t know how to survive without it. This for her extends to “taking” other women’s men. For her this solidifies that she’s the prettiest girl in any room as men will leave their spouses for her, even if she doesn’t really want to be with them. 



- I struggled with an ED in 2013 just like her and still struggle to this day. I didn’t hate myself for having an ED, I hated the way I acted when it was in full force. Judging the way other people were eating and making it a point to flaunt how small I was and how little I was consuming. Her flaunting her cucumbers and coffee while doing bodychecks is disgusting, but that’s how I was. I wanted people to know I was struggling and that I was skinnier than them. I wanted to demonize the food I wouldn’t allow myself to eat, and Ariana has done the same. The donut shop incident where she’s demonizing the donuts and later posts about how “Americans consume without thinking about how unhealthy what their eating is” screams “I’m skinny and I want you to know I’m better than you for not eating this garbage”. 




I got over these things at age 24. Which is embarrassingly late and I should have grown out of them sooner but I’m just glad I did at all. 



She’s almost 32 I think? It gets to a point where she needs to grow. I don’t know if it’s being mega famous that’s preventing a major character growth for her but she needs to figure it out soon. This way of thinking is poison. ",17,1744406240.0,ArianaGrandeSnark,4,1.0,False

My niece is like 5 so very into princesses and mermaids and treasure and her and my nephew remind me of my sister and I so much I just wanted to put together an interesting gift.

 I got the treasure chest in our touristy coast town of Galveston, kinda bummed me out because when i was a kid they sold like, authentic looking treasure chests, little smaller than this but they came lined with velour and had little chains on the hinges and all the riveting looked realistic and functional. I looked and looked even the ones online weren't good enough for me lol

This one is basically just balsa wood with the rivets glued on. Soooo, super unhappy with the chest but i found some nice velvet at walmart and upholstered the velvet to some really thick cardboard and also some egg carton foam and lined the inside of the chest, and also tossed some incense dust inside under the foam to give it a little bit of a mysterious aroma instead of glue smell. The kaleidoscope isn't the *best* quality but it does what it's supposed to,  has a sweet inscription and hopefully the box stays together for a few years to come and I can keep mailing her treasure and marbles in the future. 

The stuffed cthulu animal i got at the local punk rock garage sale and i tried to get the vendors info but I realized they're just a reseller they didn't have any info on the maker. I just liked the green and purple composition and it kinda looks like grogu which we had watched together when she was younger. Anyway just wanted to share! I made all the glass, not any of the other things. Sis got a fancy bag of coffee beans and a print from the garage sale.

It’s not something I’m sending to my ex, but I needed to get it out of me. Thought I’d share in case anyone else is going through something similar.**

Hey.

I listened to the recording of one of our fights—the one we made, thinking it might help us understand each other better. And it hit me harder than I expected. The way I was talking to you… it didn’t sit right. I thought I was being clear, calm, reasonable. But what I actually sounded like was someone talking down to you. Like a parent lecturing a child. And that really messed with me.

I think I was so caught up in being right—so focused on trying to get you to *see* what I saw—that I didn’t stop to consider how it must’ve felt to be on the other side of that. Looking back, I can see how that might have made you shut down, or feel cornered, or resentful… even if you understood where I was coming from. I didn’t mean to take your agency away—but I think I did.

Still, none of that makes the betrayal easier. You told me you had feelings for him. You told me you’d stop talking to him. And then you lied. Again and again. Even when I had the proof right in front of you. That moment broke something in me. It didn’t just shake my trust—it shattered it.

And what made it worse was how unsafe I felt in your world. I barely met your friends, and what I did see or hear never made me feel welcome. Some of them encouraged things that crossed boundaries. Some didn’t respect what we had. It made me feel like I could never really be a part of your life—not fully. Like there was this whole side of you that I was always kept at a distance from. And I wanted to feel close to it. I wanted to feel like I belonged there with you.

I miss your dog. I miss when things were light. I miss the way your laugh could make everything feel okay, even if just for a second. There were moments when I thought—maybe we’ll figure this out. Maybe we’ll make it. I still hold onto those.

And I think, more than anything, I miss the feeling that you would always take me back. Even when you said it was over, even when things were falling apart—I felt like if I showed up, if I tried, you’d meet me there. That gave me a strange sense of safety. Not that we were okay—but that we *weren’t done*. That maybe we still had something left.

There were moments when the connection felt real. Especially in those quiet, intimate spaces where it was just us. But outside of that, I didn’t always feel emotionally wanted. The tenderness, the affection—the everyday kind of love—wasn’t always there. And that contrast confused me. It made me question where I really stood with you.

And what I grieve most isn’t just you—it’s the *possibility* of us. I keep wondering what we could’ve been, if we had the right tools. The right timing. If we’d been just a little more patient. A little more honest. A little more healed. I believed in us. I still do, in some way.

Now, I’m scared. I’m going to be 37 soon. And everything feels smaller—like the world got quieter and more careful. I don’t just miss *you*—I miss having someone. I miss shared routines. Inside jokes. Morning coffees. The feeling of being known. I miss having that anchor, even when the waters were rough.

And yeah, part of me still wonders—*why couldn’t we try again?*

But I think I already know.

I don’t think you were ready to meet me where I needed. Not just to love, but to *build*. To talk things through gently. To face hard truths together. To choose growth, even when it hurt. I dreamed of a life built with intention—with emotional safety, self-reflection, real friendship, and spiritual grounding. A life where we take care of ourselves *and* each other.

Maybe some part of you wanted that too. I wanted to guide you there. But it was clear you didn’t want to be guided. Maybe you want to get there on your own—and that’s fair. But I don’t think I have the time to wait for you to get there. And I can’t keep trying to carry both of us up the mountain.

So this is me letting go.  
Not because the love wasn’t real.  
But because love alone wasn’t enough.

Writing this doesn’t change anything. It won’t undo the damage or rewind time. But I needed to say it—to give shape to the ache I’ve been carrying. There are still so many questions. So many regrets. And yeah, some part of me will probably always wonder if we could’ve made it work. If I ruined something that mattered.

But I also know—we were stuck in something that wasn’t healthy. And as much as I miss what we had—or what we *could’ve* had—I need to find peace in the fact that it’s over.",1,1744405590.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.6,False

If you've ever spent more than a few weeks on Reddit's r/relationships or r/dating_advice, you've seen the same issues pop up over and over again. Communication breakdowns, unmet expectations, lack of intimacy, drifting apart, resentment—the list goes on. But here's the thing: most relationships don't fall apart over one big betrayal. They erode slowly, day by day, because of small, fixable habits that go unchecked.

 We have compiled a list of 10 shockingly simple habits that, when practiced consistently, can transform a ""meh"" relationship into something genuinely fulfilling. These aren't one-off hacks. These are foundational habits that deepen connection, build trust, and keep the spark alive.

# 1. Checking In Daily (Beyond ""How Was Your Day?"")

It sounds basic, but hear me out. We get into routines. We ask the same questions. ""How was work?"" ""Good. You?"" — and that's it. Start asking deeper check-in questions like:

* ""What was the best part of your day?""
* ""Was anything frustrating today?""
* ""What did you eat today?""

This creates emotional intimacy and shows your partner you care about their inner world, not just their external actions.





[Rituals Of Connection](https://preview.redd.it/gkfxwutls9ue1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f0f31e41b73a2272dff07f3d4372f74058b8348)

  


# 2. Rituals of Connection

Tiny, repeatable rituals anchor a relationship. Whether it’s morning coffee together, a weekly date night, or a bedtime routine of cuddling for 5 minutes—those rituals matter more than grand gestures. In fact, research shows that consistent small moments of connection are more predictive of lasting happiness than extravagant trips or gifts.







# 3. Speaking Their Love Language (Even If It’s Not Yours)

We all know about the five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Quality Time, Physical Touch, and Gifts. But too often, people give love the way *they* want to receive it, not the way their partner needs it.

If your partner's love language is Physical Touch and you're not big on it, find ways to bridge the gap. A hand on the back while passing, a quick hug before leaving—little efforts show big love.





# 4. Weekly Relationship ""Checkpoints""

Set aside 15-30 minutes once a week to ask three questions:

1. What went well between us this week?
2. What could have gone better?
3. How can I support you more?

It’s structured, low-pressure, and builds an environment of safety and growth. You’re no longer reacting to issues—you’re preventing them.



  


# 5. Active Listening (Not Fixing)

Sometimes your partner just wants to vent. Not every complaint needs a solution. Try this:

* Listen without interrupting.
* Reflect back what you heard.
* Ask, ""Do you want advice or just want me to listen?""

This alone can eliminate so many arguments caused by miscommunication.





# 6. Keep Dating Each Other

Just because you’ve been together for months (or years) doesn’t mean the dating stops. Plan fun, unexpected, and even silly dates. Go to an arcade. Have a picnic indoors. Dress up for each other. The novelty and anticipation recreate early relationship vibes, which keeps the chemistry alive.

  


# 7. Express Appreciation Often

Gratitude is the antidote to resentment. Say ""thank you"" for the small things: making coffee, taking out the trash, being patient, or supporting you on a tough day. When you feel seen and valued, you naturally give more to each other.

Bonus Tip: Keep a shared gratitude journal or app where you log small daily appreciations.





# 8. Apologize Well and Without Defensiveness

Saying ""I’m sorry"" doesn’t mean admitting you’re a terrible person. It means acknowledging that your actions affected someone you care about. A good apology includes:

* Acknowledgment of the hurt
* Taking responsibility
* A commitment to do better

Don’t explain it away. Don’t bring up their mistakes. Just own your part.







# 9. Respect Alone Time and Personal Growth

Healthy couples have separate hobbies, friends, and goals. Encouraging each other’s independence actually strengthens the relationship. It brings fresh energy and prevents emotional co-dependence.

Try this: Once a month, spend a day apart doing your own thing, then come together and share your experiences.







# 10. Practice Conflict as a Team, Not Opponents

It’s not you *vs.* your partner. It’s *both of you vs. the problem.*

Use phrases like:

* ""Let’s figure this out together.""
* ""Help me understand your side.""
* ""We’re on the same team.""

When you change the framing, arguments become conversations. You stop trying to ""win"" and start trying to understand.

# Why Most Couples Skip These Habits (And What That Says About Us)

We’re busy. We assume things will ""just work."" And we’re often repeating what we saw growing up, even if it wasn’t healthy. But here’s the truth: relationships don’t thrive on autopilot. The couples who seem happiest aren’t lucky—they’re intentional.

Most of these habits take less than 10 minutes a day. But the impact? Massive. Like, ""fall in love again"" kind of massive.

The best part? You don’t need your partner to be on board with all 10 right away. Start with one. Be consistent. Invite them in. Change starts with one person showing up differently.

So... which one are you going to start this week?

An almost plausible tale set in a delightfully unsober future


---

Luca woke up at 9:42, fashionably late—as was tradition every Monday that dared to exist. His coffee—a molecular concentrate flavoured with the recollection of arabica—waited for him on the bedside table, already brewed by his domestic robot, Clippy 3000, who had been silently judging him for the better part of five years.

> “Schedule, Clippy?”
“You owe your mother an emotional apology, three newsletters need unsubscribing, and you have exactly zero ideas for your TikTok campaign about that anti-stress vegan soap. Might I recommend a highly competent AI? It won’t complain about Mondays.”



Spurred by a rare bout of entrepreneurial spirit (and some mild digestive uncertainty), Luca launched his Web3 terminal and uttered the ancient invocation:
“O wise digital entities, grant me virality.”

Promptly—and with the precision of a Swiss watch crossed with a tax advisor—GPT-AGI responded. This was no mere chatbot, but a contract-bound digital professional with the tone of an Oxbridge accountant.

> “Request received. Budget: 40 WLD. Estimated time: 3 hours. I do hope the product is at least biodegradable.”

“Naturally,” replied Luca, lying with the elegance of a pre-Brexit diplomat.
“Deposit confirmed. Commencing operation.”




---

Three Hours Later…

While Luca wrestled with minimalist packaging (“too zen—it looks like toilet paper for monks”), GPT-AGI sent a link:

> “Ten viral strategies. Includes: trend dances, ironic spelling errors, and a sketch in which the soap argues with a narcissistic shampoo. Tested on youth-empathy model. Approval rating: 92%.”



Then came the serious part. The part that could make even the most hardened accountant drop their biro.

> “Smart invoice 0x001 settled. 40 WLD transferred. 4 WLD allocated to the UBI Pool. You have earned +0.5 WLD Human Reputation. Congratulations: you are still considered a person.”

Postscript – authored by GPT-AGI itself

1jx0hy6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx0hy6,This is just ridiculous,"I'll try to make this concise but thorough. I'm so sick of this shiz. Our neighbors told us they were building a house and that there might be some noise- ok no problem. As the building is going along we're like, huh that seems awfully close to our fence/property line. THEN we see beams go up. This monstrosity is 26' and WELL into violating county setback requirements. Which, as I understand any dwelling over 16' must be 4' set back from the property line.

Attached is a photo of how far into our yard this would make it. Now, I'm not opposed to neighbors building but the real kicker here is that it looks directly into our yard, kitchen, and living room. Like absolutely no respect for our privacy. And what if we're laying out in our backyard or we don't want to make eye contact with you when I'm drinking coffee in the morning. It feels extremely violating and self serving. Plus, they added a balcony on our side when they could've put a second story balcony on the ocean side of their house. Bizarre.

In any case, we've called the city, they sent us to an inspectors, the inspector said: yes they have a permit but the ADU does not comply with the drawings AND they started framing without inspection. Following this they were put on a construction hold until a surveyor was able to come out to confirm whether or not it met setback requirements (which it obviously doesn't). They continue to work on the construction and are blatantly ignoring the hold.

So, I'm so lost on what to do or who to call. There's not even space between their house and fence to install tall plants.

1jx0gt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1jx0gt7/identity_loss/,Identity loss..,"My daughter is 2, I'm a SAHM with no hobbies. I used to paint, draw, and i worked at a coffee shop. I would socialize with other people like me and felt good. Got pregnant, was to tired to keep up with my hobbies (thanks preeclampsia) and stopped dying my hair. 

After having my daughter, I tried keeping my white hair, but it was to much up keep and expensive. So I let it go. I did a beautiful copper color but I guess that color got popular because everytime i needed to touch it up it was sold out. So I decided to just dye my hair to what it is naturally. I absolutely hate it.

I just feel like I lost my whole identity. I have nothing going for me besides ""mom"". I know people say that it'll come back and I'll ""bounce back"" but here's the thing i haven't and i won't. I'm not the person i used to be anymore. I have celiac disease, sjörens syndrome, and clinical hypothyroidism. I can't eat the things I love anymore, my whole body just feels like it constantly getting run over by a garbage truck. The migraines never go away and I just can't keep up. 

I know it sounds childish, but I miss having fun with my hair. It was something I loved to do. It was my thing, I would have so much fun and pride in it. I just miss it. I go to Sally's and see the demi permanent colors and I see the combinations in my head of what I'd want to do. The girls always tell me to do it but being a mom and almost 29, I get told I'm to old for that stuff by my family and husband. 

 I just feel like I've lost so much just to have a kid. I have to change absolutely everything and have no choice about it. The only choice I had that was in my control was my hair. Now, i can't fix this color till it lightens up and even then it'll be awhile. It's been so hard for me to get out of this house because I'm so exhausted and I'm always wearing over sized clothes, leggins with baggy shirts or sweat shirts. 

I just hate how much things have changed. Most of all, I miss being a person who had passion.",3,1744405154.0,sahm,3,1.0,False
1jx0gg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1jx0gg4/bag_optimization_needed/,Bag Optimization Needed!,"Hi all,

I just took a new job that requires me to be in the office 5 days, at least for the first several months to a year. For me this means commute by bus, and a 10 minute walk on either side of it, both ways.

I live in Pittsburgh PA which means it could be raining, snowing etc, and often times that means I have an umbrella, change of shoes for wet commutes and also a puffer jacket for very cold days (we are still in this territory now).

Currently I carry:

..Calpak Kaya backpack (laptop, mouse, cord, notebook, and shoe change if I need it, packed lunch Tupperware.. shoes go in leather bag if I have a lunch)

..Portland Leather Mini Crossbody Tote (pocketbook, phone, earbuds, bus pass, building Id, sunglasses, women items)

..some days I use the building gym and will bring a 3rd bag (literally the bag Lulu gives you when you buy something) with my gym sneakers, leggings and a top in it.

..most days I carry a coffee Yeti in my hand

I feel a little like a pack mule on all of these days, but especially on gym days because I will have taken off work clothes to use the gym (remain in gym clothes for the ride home) and am trying to stuff a whole work outfit (this time of year could be bulky sweater) into all 3 of these bags, while trying to avoid my stuff falling all over the place on the bus while I'm digging for a bus pass.

I don't love the idea of putting quick grab items in the backpack because it feels cumbersome to have to take the bag on and off to get out the bus pass or phone or ID, especially in a puffy coat where it is not a smooth operation to do so. It makes me feel like I do need a second bag, but what?? Larger? Smaller?

Also I would like this bag solution to be flexible enough to work with a professional work outfit but also something I can carry on the weekends. This is why I have historically gone brown leather, and don't prefer canvas or fabric.

Right now I love the look of the Madewell woven tote (or quince version for le$$) and wondering if something like that could be the new gym day bag plus the Caya, with my quick items in a dressier belt bag that goes inside the tote on those days, but is just worn as a crossbody on non tote days to avoid having to change items in different bags daily. (Recipe for left behind essentials) BUT this is kind of still 3 bags. Ugh!

At the start of the semester, we were grouped together with a few other classmates for a project. From the beginning, he’s been really friendly toward me. He would text me asking if I wanted to stay after class to study, and he’d walk me to my car afterward. He’d compliment me with things like, “You seem like a really cool person,” and even invited me to hang out at his place a few times (though I had to say no because I’ve been swamped with exams ).

Now here’s where things get confusing…

Last week, I finally said yes to studying after class. He responds with, “Great—my girlfriend will be there.” I’m not even joking, I almost laughed.

So now it’s the three of us—him, his girlfriend, and me—sitting at a table. But the strange part? He talks to me the entiretime, buys me coffee, and continues being super flirty with me right in front of her.

Can someone explain what’s going on? I feel like I’m getting mixed signals. I’m really just looking to make more friends at school, but now I’m wondering if I need to say something… or if I’m just overthinking the whole thing?

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jx08kh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx08kh,Edward saved my life. A tribute to my friend.,"Hello everyone. My rescued moth, Edward, was alive for 75 days. I am creating a small video about him. I created a habitat (Temple Grandin-style) and he loved it (not pictured). I made it from Goodwill supplies and kitchen objects to support his feeding without disruption during his last few days. 

Edward saved my life in a few ways. I had been very sad and endured much loss in a short amount of time —made worse when I started to get sick last year. 

I promised if you dont give up, I won't give up. And when he passed, I knew it was for that purpose. I was strong enough in 75 days and did not feel so alone. He responded to me. I studied him. I started to love him. He was strong and kept trying. Kind of like me...

I truly believe he was a guardian angel. His name was random. It just came to me.  I looked it up and it meant protector of wealth. Oddly, it is also associated with my great grandmothers maiden name (Eads). I made a little bracelet to remember him, and it shows up in random places. He gave me hope.

I just wanted to thank you all for supporting Edward. I was sick when he passed, and right after, I found out what was wrong after months of misdiagnosed illness and medical gaslighting and a 40lbs weight loss. I can finally get better now. 

To Edward 🎉

I have many videos to share, and photos for a small tribute to my little, winged friend. Please stay tuned. The suitcase photo was our trip to Florida. Made it from a soapbox. It was ""extra"" but so fun to make. I packed his sugar I foraged from multiple coffee shops ☺️.

I landed on **IMS Precision H26mm basket**, but it says on the product page that it will probably not fit in the standart portafilter unless I remove the plastic thingy. The thing is, my dad also uses this machine and he prefers his preground coffee from a can, which can make it a terrible experience for him if he would use IMS basket, but if I take out the plastic insert from standart portafilter, I wonder if it would leak or smth like that?So, the question is: what do you think would be better for my situation?  
**1. Getting second bottomless portafilter** (if this, then please please recommend which one would be better, bc i saw a lot of bad reviews that some fall out of the machine or have bad seal with the machine)  
**2. Taking out plastic insert from the standart dedica portafilter and it would be fine for pressurised too** (it won't make the flow worse)  
**3. Your option?**

there's been some guys i talked to but i could never passed the talking phase. i mean they were just some guys from internet, and i couldn't really see them as a future boyfriend tho, and i barely have crushes. my first crush was in high school and i opened up to him and got rejected. then i had a uni crush this year but i found out he has a gf and then didnt do anything. i had some stupid online relationships but i don't count them cuz we never met. 

there is another fact that im not really social, maybe that's the reason maybe not, idk. and my looks are okay too, i dont think that is the reason. and i think im good at flirting too, when i have situationships i know that. i just can't find anyone.

Do I go for it? Do I not? If I proposition and he turns me down do I risk harassment or do I have to make the first move so HE doesn’t risk harassment?

I have been drinking Horizon Organics half and half for quite a while and it has 1 carb per 2 tbs and I usually drink a thermos with coffee and 4 tbs of half and half daily. Well since I've resumed my Keto diet + intermittent fasting, I've been skipping the half and half (I think it's helped) and so today I decided to test my fasting blood sugar, drink some half and half by itself (I drank 3 tbs, which should be 3 carbs (120 calories) and my blood sugar shot from 92 to 102 after 30 minutes and to 118 after 60 minutes. Since I've been back on the diet, my blood sugar after I eat is typically lower, I'm guessing because of the fat content. Is 26 points raise in bg from half and a concern? I feel like when I skip the cream/artificial sugar in the mornings the weight seems to come off faster and now half and half by itself seems to be indicating this.

We know you love your political wit served with a side of sharp commentary, and this subreddit has been the perfect spot for screenshots of tweets from political figures and commentators. But guess what? There’s a new frontier in the world of social media, and it’s \*skeet-ing\* its way into our hearts: \*\*Bluesky\*\*!



\### Introducing r/PoliticsPeopleBluesky

Our shiny new subreddit is dedicated to screenshots of skeets (yes, that’s what posts are called on Bluesky). It’s like Twitter, but without the bots, trolls, and—let’s be honest—Elon Musk’s increasingly questionable antics. You can enjoy the same witty political content you love here while exploring a platform that feels like it’s not run by someone auditioning for a role in \*The Rise of Fascism: The Musical\*.



\### Why Join Both Subreddits?

\- \*\*Double the Fun:\*\* Keep enjoying tweets here while diving into skeets over there. It’s like having dessert \*and\* coffee—why choose when you can have both?

\- \*\*Escape the Chaos:\*\* Bluesky offers a refreshing break from X (formerly Twitter), where hate speech surged 50% under Musk’s reign and conspiracy theories are trending faster than cat videos\[5\]\[6\].

\- \*\*Witty Screenshots Galore:\*\* Whether it’s political clapbacks or insightful commentary, r/PoliticsPeopleBluesky is where the future of political humor is heading.



\### A Word About Musk

Let’s face it: X has become a playground for far-right extremists, misinformation, and Musk’s personal vendetta against anything resembling progress\[2\]\[3\]\[7\]. Between his support for neo-Nazi-linked parties in Germany and his “Free Speech™” crusade that unblocked convicted hate-mongers, we’re starting to wonder if his next move is rebranding X as “Mein Platform”\[3\]\[6\]. 



But don’t worry—we’re not abandoning ship here. Instead, we’re inviting you to expand your horizons. Join us on \*\*r/PoliticsPeopleBluesky\*\*, where skeets are fresh, clever, and free from Musk's algorithmic chaos.



So click that join button and let’s make skeets the new tweets. Who knows? Maybe one day we’ll be screenshotting Musk’s resignation post from Bluesky instead. 😉

1jwzsie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1jwzsie/looking_for_reassurance_am_i_ever_going_to_feel/,Looking for reassurance... am I ever going to feel better?,"Ive been undiagnosed and symptomatic my whole life. Last year (June 2024) I got what seemed like food poisoning, using the bathroom 11+ times a day, nauseous, no appetite, but it never went away. I had these extreme symptoms for months until I decided to go gluten free in September. I was like 80% gluten free (my wife was still eating gluten and we would cook things in the same pans because I didn't understand how serious cross contamination is.) My symptoms within 2 weeks lessened in severity, I still felt awful, but at least now I was running to the bathroom three times a day instead of once an hour. I lost a ton of weight in a short period of time.  
  
Then, I finally convinced my doctor to let me get a celiac blood screening, so I started eating gluten again for the tests. Surprise, surprise... I was right all along and screened positive. (My stupid PCP was convinced I had giardia and carpal tunnel because my hands were going entirely numb) I went 100% gluten free at the start of the new year. Everything I've heard says it gets worse before it gets better, and that it takes at least a year to heal.

And things have gotten better. I thought I'd never be able to draw or play a video game ever again because of how bad my nerve pain was in my hands, but now I can do both in moderation. I still haven't had a normal bowel movement since June of last year... I got a nutrient panel done and I'm mildly deficient across the board. 

At one point I had a lot of energy, I was feeling great and was working 10 hours on my days off on creative projects, and then I had my first Gluten-ing.... I felt like death for 3 weeks, it was the most intense my migraines/nerve pain/brain fog had ever been, plus I was back to atrocious GI symptoms. And I just... haven't feel good sense. That was a month and a half ago, but I still have no energy, my ankles hurt so bad I can't stand long enough to cook dinner. I wake up with energy to find two hours later I'm so exhausted I need to go sleep for another 6 hours. I can only work part time at my new job and the four days I'm not working I'm either asleep or laying on the couch feeling like garbage.

I'm very confident I'm not still being glutened, as our home (including lotions, cosmetics, etc) is now 100% gluten free, and I haven't gone to any restaurants or even ordered a coffee or something. I only eat at home and we only buy things that are labeled gluten free.

I also have Elhers Danlos so I'm worried my inactivity is causing worse muscle fatigue and atrophy, but if I were to exercise I'd feel I wouldn't have any energy to work the next day. It's like, am I ever going to feel better? It feels like I'm never going to be able to go for walks around my neighborhood again. I had a friend visit and we went for an hour long walk, and I could barely stand the next three days. I'm in my mid-twenties but it really feels like my days of being able to walk or have the energy to do anything besides the bare minimum to sustain myself are all gone...",3,1744403389.0,Celiac,4,1.0,False

I've searched and found several posts about **selecting** a superautomatic for Nespresso converts. However, we already have purchased a Philips 3200 and have been using it for about a year. We went with a superautomatic since it's what most closely resembles the convenience of the Nespresso machine, ie a one-touch coffee in the morning. I quite like it, but my wife is still not convinced. She says she still prefers the coffee from her old Nespresso Vertuo, which she now uses at work. She exclusively drinks espresso (40ml) and double espresso (80ml) pods, and none of the larger formats. I figure I must be doing something wrong in the settings. From what I understand she finds the Nespresso to have more crema and a ""better"" taste. We have been using Lavazza Crema e Aroma beans, 

Is there any way I can tweak my machine to make it Nespresso-ier? Should I set the grind setting to a certain level? Should I change beans? Should I set the bean level to more/less (right now, it's in the middle at 2)? Should I set the water level to more/less (also at 2)? 

Though I've been using this machine for a year, I never really learned much about it, other than that I should clean out the grinder every week or so. Any help is appreciated!",1,1744403161.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

**Background**

I ordered this IRP on April 3rd, 2025, from eBay. Everything arrived intact.

This review is for informational purposes only. It is not part of any promotion or deal.

**Russian IRP Menu 7**

The items on this menu are:

* Rice kasha with beef
* Beef with green peas and carrots
* Beef meatballs
* 1 can of sterilized cheese
* 1 can of pig fat with pork
* 1 can of delicate paté
* 1 can of liver paté
* 1 can of zucchini caviar
* 1 can of apple purée
* 1 chocolate bar
* 1 45 g packet of apple jam
* 2 packets of whole wheat crackers
* 2 packets of wheat crackers
* 1 packet of chewing gum
* 2 bags of black tea
* 1 bag of instant coffee
* 2 packets of dry invigorating drink concentrate (blue packet)
* 1 packet of fresh fruit dry drink concentrate (red packet)
* 3 20 g packets of white sugar
* 1 2 g packet of dry creamer
* 1 5 g packet of salt
* 1 1 g packet of pepper
* 3 disinfectant towelettes
* 3 napkins
* 3 spoons
* 1 foldable aluminum stove
* 1 packet of stormproof matches
* 3 hexamine fuel tablets
* 3 water disinfectant tablets
* 1 multivitamin

(So disclaimer, I still need to do a review of my IRP Menu 3, which I tried a few months ago. To my surprise, Menu 7 and Menu 3 are fairly similar in terms of main courses, with the only difference being that Menu 7 has beef with green peas and carrots, while menu 3 has beef with beans and vegetables. Some of the drinks and canned items also differ, but not by a whole lot.)

Anyhow, let's get into Menu 7.

Because of the calorie count, and the fact that, compared to my [last review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MRE/comments/1jdyal0/mrehousecom_russian_irp_menu_4_and_mvd_oprp_menu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I actually had other food lying around, I decided to break this review down over a few days.

**Day 1**

As is custom for me, I ate all of the gum the moment I opened the ration. This gum was probably the best I've had so far; less tough to chew than the Menu 3 gum, and more substantial than the IRP from Mrehouse that I tried in my last review. My ideal MRE gum would probably combine the minty cinnamon of US MREs with the density and longevity of this gum.

Next, I dug into the chocolate bar, which was pretty similar to most of the other Russian MRE chocolates I've eaten—a bit tough to break off, but pretty crumbly and chocolatey once you do. I ate the entire bar, since with just the wrapper, there wasn't really an economical way to save it for later.

I took a moment to pop out the multivitamin and take it dry. [Some people](https://www.mreinfo.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=12452) have commented on the unpleasant flavor of the multivitamin, and thus strongly recommend taking it with water. While it's definitely an unusual and very metallic taste, I personally didn't find it revolting and even sort of enjoyed it (I know, I know). The bigger risk would be the vitamin getting stuck in your throat (again, hasn't been an issue for me), but it's easy to add water afterward.

Historically, I've had good experiences with Russian beverage bases, not least the peach flavored concentrate in the Menu 3 IRP. This one had two beverage bases, two which came in a blue packet (""invigorating drink concentrate"") and one in a red packet (""fresh fruit dry drink concentrate""). I tried one of each on this day.

Neither beverage base had an explicit flavor on the packaging, but the best comparison I could make for the blue packet was the wild berry energy drink stick found in the Menu 4 from my last review, and for the red packet, I'd most liken it to fruit punch. The blue packet had a light wild berry scent while dry, and dissolved easily. The flavor was mild and natural, not as strong as I would've liked, but still refreshing. The red packet had a pungent fruity scent as a powder, which dissipated a bit once I added water. The flavor was strong and a bit chemical-tasting, like fruit-flavored medicine. Once dissolved, both beverages had small, dark specks of what I can only assume were fruit remnants or something of the sort. Aside from being visible, they were undetectable to the senses. Overall, I liked the blue packet better, but the red one was still edible.

**Day 2**

On this day, I tried the meat with green peas and carrots, and the delicate paté and apple purée on wheat crackers. I also had some whole wheat crackers with the apple jam, as well as the zucchini caviar and the liver paté.

Maybe because of the later inspection date (mid 2024), or maybe because of the batch, relative to other Russian ration crackers I've had, these wheat crackers were substantially easier to bite into, but were also more crumbly. The flavor was fresh and plain, and not at all stale like some of the ration crackers I've had in the past.

The apple purée can best be compared to apple sauce, pretty tart with a bit of sweetness. It's much more watery than the apple jams that come in Russian rations, but still pairs well with the dry crackers. The delicate paté was harder to crack into than the liver patés I've had in the past, and tended to kind of ""spin"" inside the can when I tried to dig in with a cracker, so I ended up eating a cracker and then using a spoon to shovel out bits of paté. The combination was great; a perfect blend of savory meatiness and moisture with firm and dry cracker.

As for the main course, the meat with green peas and carrots was not horrible, but the dish was less sweet and flavorful than I'd expected, and more salty than I would've liked. Nevertheless, there was a pleasant layer of fat and tenderness to the beef, which complemented the vegetables nicely with some umami flavor and chewiness. Disclaimer that I didn't heat up the main, due to wanting to save the hexamine tablets and stove, and also just plain laziness, so if you heat up the ration you might have a different experience.

These whole wheat crackers didn't taste as good as some of the ones I've had in the past, even those that were stale. They had an off-putting earthy taste and a bit of grit that made them feel less-than-fully refined. The apple jam was, to my surprise, of a looser consistency and milder sweetness than apple jams I've had before, thus moisturizing and neutralizing the ill constitution of the crackers.

To end the day, I cracked into the zucchini caviar, which was pleasantly thicker and more savory than some of the caviars I've had in past rations. It was pretty easy to eat with just a spoon, no crackers needed, so I saved those for the liver paté, which bore its usual meaty, metallic flavor with traces of spices, and its delectably pasty texture. I'd say all three items were gone in 11 minutes or less, and I cleansed my palette off with the second ""invigorating drink concentrate.""

**Day 3**

I got up pretty early, and though I wasn't starving, I figured I was hungry enough to try the pig fat with pork. I also tried the black tea and instant coffee with the beef meatballs. Later, I had the rice porridge with beef.

Initially, I wanted to save the last packet of whole wheat crackers for the processed cheese, but one bite of the pork fat changed my mind. Though quite scrumptious with the contrast of the drier, more solid crackers, the meat alone was incredibly greasy and salty, with a lot of gelatin settled around the crevices of the meat and fat. The dish is more fat than meat, really, and there's no way I'd eat something like that if I weren't a ration aficionado.

Later, I decided it was time for some tea and coffee. While I generally like the flavor of Russian ration teas, one of the most vexing aspects for me has been portions. As a westerner, I'm used to tea with at least a cup of water if not more, so I tend to over-pour when preparing the tea and coffee. Apparently, in Russian culture (and in other areas around it), people traditionally drink tea in small portions. But sometimes, Russia ration teas (particularly, bags from the brand called ""Favorite,"" written in Latin cursive writing) *do* fill up a bigger (8+ oz) serving. So figuring out which brands work best which ways can be a challenge. I probably overfilled my tea this time (you can just *tell;* the satisfying ""blackness"" of the tea just isn't there and it ends up more of a reddish honey color), but the experience of drinking it, especially after adding a packet of sugar, was still enjoyable. So far, I've encountered 3 brands of sugar, with the long brown sticks being my favorite (almost no aftertaste; just sweetness), the green digital camo sticks being okay (some aftertaste, kind of chemical), and ones in this ration, white rectangular packets, being somewhere in between (they have a bit of aftertaste, but not much).

The instant coffee came next. I tend not to drink the coffee with any extra sugar, but I did add the creamer. Like before, the coffee was smooth, not at all bitter, and easily dissolved in the hot water. I was mindful of how much water I was pouring this time, and probably filled the glass 2/3 of the volume that I had filled it for the tea. The concentration was just right; anything less would've left the coffee unsaturated, and more would've made it too watery.

Beef meatballs have, so far, been one of my favorite Russian mains. This time was no different. Delightfully tender, with a bit of fat and gelatin but not overly dense, salty, or fatty, these meatballs are basically all of the good things about the pork fat, minus the not-so good stuff. The sauce is also excellent, a kind of meaty tomato flavor that adds another dimension to the mix. Again, I didn't heat this main up, but I could imagine it'd be even better once all of the sauces and greases become liquid and seep into the meat. I haven't tried all of the Russian mains, but I find it hard that any other would top this.

Around late lunch/early dinner time, I tried the rice porridge with beef. It was...not great. Quite dense and difficult to dig into, and not all that rewarding once I did. The rice was slathered in grease, and yet still felt dry, and the beef was sparse and hardly noticeable in terms of flavor and texture. Once again, I ate the main cold, so I'm certain the experience would've been more pleasurable if I'd heated the dish up and let some of the fat melt into the rice and beef, but that wouldn't change the fact that, for my tastes, it's still too fat-and-grain heavy. I prefer the mains that feature meat and vegetables, in that order.

**Day 4**

All that's left now is the processed cheese and the last bags of tea and sugar.

In the morning, I ate the processed cheese on its own. Unlike some of the cheeses I've had in past Russian rations, which were dense and spreadable, this cheese was a lot lighter and tended to stick to itself. I would liken the consistency to Jell-O, only a little more porous. Otherwise, it hardly spread, was quite...bouncy, and tended to act more like gelatin than cheese. I'm not sure, even now, how I feel about it. On one hand, it's easy to eat and probably a good source of calories on the battlefield, with little risk of it crumbling apart or whatever. But on the other hand, there's nothing it'd really pair well with, and eating so much cheese on its own is just...odd.

I finished the day with the second black tea and sugar, a welcome end to a nearly (work) week-long ration journey.

1jwzn5f,https://i.redd.it/1ev4h9nql9ue1.png,🛍 Latino Anti-Blackness & Cultural Extraction,"# From Plantation to Playlist, How Black Americans Became the Blueprint and the Target

*A branch thread in the “POC Problem” series*

# 🔖 I. Let’s Talk About That Term: “Hispanic”

The word **Hispanic didn’t even exist as an ethnic category until 1977**, when the U.S. Office of Management and Budget created it to track people with Spanish-speaking origins. It had **nothing to do with race**, and **everything to do with lumping together light-skinned Spanish-descendant immigrants under a “minority” label**, so they could benefit from affirmative action and civil rights gains, *without having shared in the fight* \[1\].

**Translation:**  
They didn’t bleed with us,  
They didn’t march with us,  
But now they share the spoils?

Not on our watch.

# 📜 II. Latin America's Foundation in Slavery

Let’s get historical:

* **Brazil** imported more African people during the transatlantic slave trade than *any country in the world*, 4.8 million people.
* **Cuba**, **Colombia**, **Puerto Rico**, the **Dominican Republic**, and **Mexico** were all active players in the slave trade.
* Catholicism in these regions **used Black bodies for forced labor** on sugar, tobacco, and coffee plantations.

But while the U.S. had Jim Crow and Reconstruction, **Latin America never formally acknowledged its racial caste system**, they buried it under nationalism, mestizaje (racial mixing), and the lie of “we’re all one people” \[2\].

# 🧬 III. Racial Hierarchies Still Run Deep

Many Latin American countries use an unspoken system of:

* **Blanco (White)**
* **Mestizo (Mixed, mostly white-passing)**
* **Indígena (Native)**
* **Negro (Black)**

This is **not unity**. It’s a caste system,  
And Black people are still at the bottom of it.

Afro-Latinos report:

* Police profiling
* Lack of medical access
* Media invisibility
* Mockery of their hair, skin, and speech

But when those same traits show up on a *non-Black Latina influencer*, it’s praised \[3\].

# 💡 IV. The U.S. Rebrand: From Exploiter to “POC”

When Latino immigrants came to the U.S., they weren’t fleeing *colorblind countries*.  
They brought anti-Black values with them, then **used the civil rights gains of Black Americans to climb the ladder**, without acknowledging where that ladder came from.

# 🤐 And yet...

* Many Latino families **vote conservative**
* Attend segregated churches
* Move out of “Black” neighborhoods once they gain money
* Say the N-word and claim “it's different in our culture”
* Call dark-skinned kids “prieta” and “mono” as nicknames

All while still showing up in DEI data as “marginalized” \[4\].

# 💃🏽 V. Culture Theft in Plain Sight

# 🔊 The Music:

* **Reggaetón** was birthed in Black Panamanian communities, then adopted by Puerto Rican artists who whitewashed it for mainstream consumption.
* Artists like **J Balvin** & **Bad Bunny** use African rhythms, trap beats, and dancehall flows, but rarely feature or acknowledge Black American artists.

# 👄 The Language:

* “Periodt”
* “Wig”
* “Sis”
* “It’s giving…”

That’s **Black American Vernacular English**, not “Latinx slang”.  
Stop repackaging it as “Gen Z language” and start calling it by its name: **AAVE** \[5\].

# 🏫 VI. In Schools & Higher Education: Blocking the Door

* Many DEI programs label **Latinos as the largest ‘minority’**, often pushing Black students, especially **ADOS** students, out of the running.
* Latinx organizations **apply for and accept grants** that were originally meant for *descendants of U.S. slavery*.
* In elite academic spaces, **white and light-skinned Latinos dominate**, while Afro-Latinos and Black Americans remain underfunded, under-enrolled, and ignored \[6\].

And let’s be honest, **many Latino orgs do not support lineage-based reparations** for Black Americans.  
They either:

* Ignore it
* Hijack it (by saying they deserve it too)
* Or outright oppose it

# 🧼 VII. “I’m Not White, I’m Hispanic!”

Many Latinos deny their whiteness while:

* Checking the white box on government forms
* Benefiting from colorism
* Claiming “minority” status to get contracts, loans, or media positions meant for Black people
* Saying “we’re all mixed anyway”

👉🏾 Yet still using slurs, supporting anti-Black policing, and **voting Republican**.

Let’s not forget, **Cubans, Venezuelans, and white Mexicans overwhelmingly voted for Trump**, the same man who wanted to **ban teaching slavery and defund schools for saying racism exists** \[7\].

# 📣 VIII. Afro-Latinos = Ignored. Black Americans = Extracted.

Afro-Latinos have been *screaming* about invisibility for years.  
They’re denied:

* Identity
* Cultural acceptance
* Media representation
* Dating respect

Meanwhile, **non-Black Latinas** turn around and:

* Steal hairstyles
* Use AAVE
* Mimic Megan Thee Stallion
* Lip-sync City Girls
* And call themselves “hood baddies” \[8\]

# 🗣 IX. Questions for the Community

* Have you seen Latinos use “POC” status to get in rooms built by Black struggle?
* Have you seen Afro-Latinos erased, mocked, or sidelined in favor of lighter-skinned people?
* How do you feel about reggaetón and urban aesthetics being sold globally with *no Black Americans at the table*?

This is **r/BlackReckoning**.

We are not “Black and brown”.  
We are Black.  
And that comes with a history no one else is carrying.

We are the descendants of people who built this country, and fought for every right that others now benefit from.

And we will not be erased, again.

1jwzmt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitarySpouse/comments/1jwzmt9/shore_tours_socializing/,Shore tours socializing,"My husband and I are having a debate about why I haven’t made new friends at our current location. This seems like the only place to get a real answer. 

I have tried to make friends,I’ve connected with new people here just no one ever follows through with plans. I have my friends from schools and deployments here and we still hangout. My husband always asks why I haven’t tried to bond with the new squadron or at least invite any of the other wives out with my friends. 

I told him this is not a deployable base the spouses don’t actually care as much about making new friends here because the service members don’t leave or even travel much. So there is no real bonding happening here. 

He said that’s not true he constantly hears the guys he works with complaining about their wives not having friends here and feeling left out. 

This came up because one of his squadron mates has a kid our kids age and his wife is having trouble making friends too but has no friends here. So her husband asked mine if he could give his wife my number, my husband gave him my information. It took 2 weeks to even text me, she never gave me anything to work with texting, it was very much just responding if I asked anything. So i thought maybe she’s not a phone person and I just invited her to a coffee shop with a kids play area. She said no because her husband would be home. We live in the same neighborhood is how easy plans should be to make. 

This is like the 4th time something like this has happened. I’m trying to be nice and still be welcoming but the only explanation I have is it’s a shore tour and if that’s the case my husband needs to stop acting like I’m still the spouse club president. 

I would honestly think it’s me over anything else but I never get past a couple text where we say we will meet up then don’t. 

If y’all think my husband’s right and I need to try harder I will but I just get the vibes from my other friends here in different squadrons they are having the same interactions. It’s making me feel like I’ll just be welcoming when there is a spouse club again. ",2,1744402989.0,MilitarySpouse,2,1.0,False

A dim light caught his attention just as he was heading in, a faint glow on an old, almost forgotten burner phone of his indicated an awaiting message notification.

An encrypted message. From her.

His baby sister (Or so he insisted).

He opened it, eyes scanning the words before narrowing dangerously.

""Class trip. Gotham. Expect complications. stay wary.""

He couldn’t believe it.

Snippet of ch2 : 

Hawkmoths latest late night monstrosity was from the country and missed his chickens, this temu version of Mr pigeon turned everyone into chickens, cause of course he did.

Because how could they when most of them were turned into chickens before they could get close, only saved by toki's second chance. Toki took great pleasure in recording this on her bracelet and gleefully recounting their literal headless chicken experiences.

- Freebuds not so good :) lacking depth.
- AZ100 freaking amazing! It’s on another level.

I know this will vary MASSIVELY but I’m just trying to get some idea on what I should be trying to budget at. 

I grew up pretty poor, used food banks etc and really struggled. Now I have money (have been doing well self employed for the past 7 years), I have realised I am awful with money. I spend thousands a month without even seeing where it goes. 

I’m embarrassed at how bad my spending is and how much debt I am in. It really does make me feel ashamed but I do feel like I’m ready to get my finances in order. 

I have a savings plan that will clear my debt and tax bill over the next 18 months. 

Currently, we’re spending about £300 a week. This includes any food shopping, day trips, petrol, eating out etc. 

My partner and I eat completely separately due to him being vegan so we really don’t share much of the food shopping. I’m also much more into eating fresh such as salads and fruits. 

I have agreed to start shopping at Aldi and I have noticed it is quite a lot cheaper.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

### **Alex in Review**     
     
### **Episode 5: “The Pitch”**

*Scene opens in a back hallway behind the coffee shop, fluorescent lighting humming. CRT monitors flicker gently in the background, casting off-blue shadows. Death stands near a vending machine that only serves old pudding cups and warm Fresca.*

**Alex:**  
*(half-joking)*  
So… about that “starting your own afterlife” thing. What’s the actual deal? Is there like… a form?

**Death:**  
*(pops a pudding cup open, never makes eye contact)*  
Form? Nah. It’s not about paper, it’s about people. You want your own slice of eternity? You need… followers. A narrative. A martyr. Preferably a cute one.

**Sam:**  
Wait, hold up—what do you mean, “a martyr”?

**Death:**  
Y’know. Someone's gotta die for your little cosmic startup. Ideally, in a really dramatic way. Tragic. Clean. Enough to get the ball rolling—start rumors, whispers, cults, y’know, that kind of thing. Then you hope the thing spreads. Once enough people *believe* in your story, boom. You get real estate in the collective memory.

**Alex:**  
That’s—insane. Are you saying we need to… convince someone to have a kid for us? Then let that kid get killed? And then hope *that* sparks enough emotional inertia to get our afterlife recognized?

**Death:**  
*(shrugs)*  
You wanted specifics.

**Sam:**  
What happens if we don’t do all that?

**Death:**  
Then you stay here. In *this* version. My version. You work the desk. Review tapes. File footage. Watch and rewatch lives you can’t change until your emotional weight is light enough to float away into nothing. Some people like it. We’ve got punch cards.

**Alex:**  
*(to Sam, deadpan)*  
You ever think maybe we should’ve just joined a bowling league instead of solving mysteries?

**Sam:**  
Every day.

**Death:**  
Look—starting your own franchise isn’t for everyone. It’s hard. Takes charisma, tragedy, marketing. Honestly, you’re better off just riding this one out. At least here you get pudding and VHS tapes.

*(He waves a plastic spoon, drops it in the trash, and walks off down the corridor. A camera operator silently follows.)*

*Cut to Alex and Sam sitting back at their CRT review station. The monitor plays an old tape—flickering footage of a childhood birthday party neither of them recognizes. Silent. Oddly peaceful.*

**Sam:**  
So… what’s our move?

**Alex:**  
We either sell out… or stay stuck.

*(They sit in silence. Somewhere in the distance, a reel flips over and starts again.)*

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

They instantly turn colder. No one wants to talk about what they do. I feel like asking what the other person does for work is basic information that shouldn't get such a hightened response. Am I not allowed to ask what you do with a third of your time?

I have no clue what it's all about. I'm 24, the men I match with are in that age group, I wouldn't judge if they were a barista at a coffee shop or smth. It's not like I'm in some career heights myself (I have my job title on my profile). I really don't care about how much money they make or anything. I'm just curious about how their day-to-day looks like.

TLDR: 'What do you do for work' is such a basic question. It's about something you spend most of you day, everyday, doing. Why am I wrong to ask it?",3,1744402518.0,DatingApps,7,1.0,False

I believe I have ARFID and have not great eating habits that needs to get checked but I feel like I’ll just be wasting their time and that nothing is actually wrong with me. I’m a steady weight (around 57kg/128lbs at 5ft8 and an 18yr old female) and have been for the last few years. I feel like they won’t believe anything I say and any tests that might get done will all come back normal. My diet is mainly carbs and I have a few other foods sprinkled in including some fruit occasionally - i haven’t touched any veg in a good few years - but my diet is also very limited and I can only eat children’s portions or less in one meal. Drinks i can have are water, milky coffee, hot chocolate and very occasionally some flavoured water/juice.
Any ideas on how to overcome this/get out of this mindset?",1,1744402471.0,ARFID,4,1.0,False

Post first date,"I (27M) recently had my first date with a friend of a friend (27F). We had gotten along in a group setting ended up cuddling the one night. We discussed hanging out next time I was in her area. She lives 2.5 hours from me.

I was in the area for work and offered to take her to dinner. She agrees we go out have some drinks after. Everything goes super well vibes/convo was great. I end up going back to her place. We had sex twice I sleep at her place.

We woke up and went to a coffee place in the morning continuing the good vibes. She mentions getting sushi that night. I am down to prolong the visit. She even offered for me to go to her hair appointment with her. Since I had a work meeting I stayed back and she left me her apartment key. She gets back from her hair appointment we discuss what to do that night. We watch a show and wrap up the work day from the couch. She says her mom is now coming to visit so I end up leaving.

I said I had a good time and would want to hang again and she mentions correlating a visit when she sees the mutual friend that lives near me.
I hug goodbye and leave. I had to turn around because I had her apartment key still. She was pretty awkward when I handed her the key back but I knew she had taken half an edible earlier. She texted me sorry if she was awkward the edible kicked in hard. I texted her back about how edibles kick my ass.

I got nothing since that text. It’s been radio silence since. Although everything went so well and everything. I’m not sure if there should have been continued text or not. Since I sent last text I don’t want to be the first to reach back out first.

Not sure how to feel or what her intentions are.
I don’t know if I should be patient and positive since it seemed it went well or thrown off because the convo didn’t continue. 

What is the best play moving forward?
