So during the week, my primary job is a Massage Therapist but on the weekends, I convert my apartment into a cozy small coffee shop and I make craft drinks to make a little money on the side.

Well I moved into this apartment about 6 months ago and I always made it a point to go to every neighbor around me and invite them over to my place for a discounted cup of coffee (since they are direct neighbors) and it’s my way of getting to know the community better.

Unfortunately, two weekends ago my neighbor directly across from me came by and essentially told me:

“Hey! So I’ve never actually stopped by but do you think you could swing me a free cup of coffee? I am a little short on money and really want to try your stuff.”

I immediately said:

“Absolutely! I totally understand being low on cash, here’s something on me, enjoy.”

Well this last weekend, he came by again and once again asked for a free cup of coffee and I simply told him:

“I can’t do that and need to make some money since the supplies cost me quite a bit.”

He literally told me:

“You are always busy, you’re telling me that you can’t just hook me up as a neighbor? Alright.”

And he headed out. But I was super confused. I clearly believe that I don’t owe this person anything just purely for the fact that “he’s my neighbor”.

Am I overreacting or should I just give the guy free coffee if he’s the only one asking and I’m making a bigger deal than I should about the whole thing.",1,1768241923.0,neighborsfromhell,0,0.67,False

1qb2jmn,https://i.redd.it/wpsc695vmycg1.jpeg,Does anyone else just want to die because life is too annoying and you’re too lazy?,"I have ADHD btw so it makes everything in life less rewarding, the amount of unfinished passion projects I have is insane, I don’t even like eating food, sometimes I would want to eat but I wanna just spend 5 mins to inject nutrients instead of having a meal, when someone asks me “what do you want to do?” Well I wanna draw and make music but I’ve already tried those, and after two days I’m already tired and despise it, things that are fun instantly become painful after I start doing them. 

Everyone around me seems to have more fun in life than me, and have much better time management. My autism and ADHD multiple each other’s problems, and when I make creative things, the pleasure is short lived. 

It’s like I feel half the tastiness in food compared to others, half the fun when drawing or making music, half the productivity, half the satisfaction from goals, and half the gratification from living a life. 

I’ve had many opportunities to escape this, and yet I failed to leap off that scaffolding at cram school in Japan when I was younger because I was such a puhh to not dive into the pit to freedom placed right in front of me and I suffer the consequences today in Canada where there are no tall building around my house. 

When I spent time grinding for a special or event item in video games, there’s anticipation, but the moment I get it, for some reason I don’t feel as accomplished as I should be. I just feel, nothing.
With a brain like this, I’d probably be still unhappy no matter what I gain in life, and the things that do are so out of reach. 

I’m tired. Just like everyone has a personal preference of coffee or tea, my personal preference of life or non life is non life. I walk right past oncoming traffic on my way home from school but I just can’t seem to find the courage to leap, even though freedom is just right there.

If anyone relate to the title or just wanna share their death method fantasies go ahead, we’ll just pretend we’ll die together ",2,1768241850.0,FootBallEmergency,0,1.0,False

Today is Monday, January 12, 2026 and it's 6:58pm. I'm sitting on the couch in my living room and typing into my laptop.

**Grounding, Step 2:** [**Anchoring yourself in the present**](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailygrounding/comments/1qaawyq/grounding_step_2_anchoring_yourself_in_the/)

Looking ahead, I can see a hand-sized, light blue book sitting on the back rest of my couch. It's cover has a matte color and it is about two thumbs wide. I can see a white wall in front of me. It's color is soft, its surface structured and the dim, orange-yellow light of my living room lights is reflecting back off it. I can see sturdy, half-crumpled up, rectangular-shaped plastic bag with a checker-board pattern printed on it lying on the floor about 2 meters away on the right side of me. I can see a black, softly shining, square-shaped, small couch pillow lying on the floor about 2 meters away from me and about 1 meter away from the crumpled up plastic bag. I can see a dark-grey, small, breakfast bowl sitting about half a meter away from me. Its surface texture is somewhere in between matte and glossy and there are thin streaks of white yoghurt stuck on its inside.

I can hear the soft and melodic sound of an accordion reaching my ears. Its volume is much lower than the modern beat that accompanies it. I can hear the soft and fairly quiet, shattering  sound of my teeth whenever they bump into each other when I clench my jaw. I can hear the quiet, whooshing sound of my breath leaving my nose, with its volume being much lower than the music that I'm listening to, to the point that I really have to focus on its sound in order to notice it. I can hear the weird, muffled, very low sound of my jaw muscles reverberating through my skull whenever I unclench my teeth. Even though this sound has a very low volume, something about its frequency makes it still noticeable over the more higher-pitched music i can hear through my headphones. I can hear the whooshing and mid-pitched sound of air leaving my mouth when I yawn.

I can smell the savory, nutty scent of peanuts from the shells sitting in a tiny bowl next to me. I can smell the aromatic, intense and savory smell of coffee, residues of which still seem to cling to the empty cup next to me. There is a sweetish, deep, warm and chocolatey scent rising from the open lip gloss tube in my hand. I can smell the sourish and creamy scent of the yoghurt sticking to the inside of a breakfast bowl next to me. I smell the fresh, slightly cold scent of the air around me.

I can still taste the slightly sourish, sweet and savory taste of the yoghurt bowl, I had earlier, in my mouth.

I can feel the structured, elevated, geometrical pattern of the blanket lying over my legs. The blanket is soft to the touch, but has a certain sturdiness to it that makes it easy for the fingers to glide over its surface. I can feel the soft, fuzzy and warm surface of the sweater sleeve covering my left arm. I can feel the soft, bouncy and warm surface of the couch that I'm sitting on. I can feel the sturdy, hard and elevated rest of the couch sticking out into my back right below my shoulder blades. I can feel the warmth around my feet accumulating under my thick wool socks.",1,1768241823.0,dailygrounding,0,1.0,False

I've been there. Here's what changed my journaling practice:



\*\*1. Set a Specific Time:\*\*

I journal at the same time every morning. No thinking about when to do it. My brain knows: 7am, coffee, journal.



\*\*2. Start Small:\*\*

Don't aim for pages. Start with 5 minutes. Three sentences. That's enough to build the habit. You can write more when inspiration strikes.



\*\*3. Keep It Accessible:\*\*

Your journaling tool matters less than having it accessible:

\- Physical notebook by your bed

\- Digital app on your phone

\- Tools like Notion, Day One, or CipherWrite for organized digital journaling



The key: remove friction. If you have to dig through a drawer to find your journal, you won't do it.



\*\*4. Use Prompts When Stuck:\*\*

Some days you won't know what to write. Use prompts:

\- What am I grateful for?

\- What challenged me today?

\- What did I learn?

\- How am I feeling?



\*\*5. Don't Judge Your Writing:\*\*

Journaling isn't about perfect prose. It's about processing your thoughts. Bad handwriting, rambling thoughts, whatever—it's all valid.



\*\*6. Celebrate Consistency:\*\*

Track your streak. Use a calendar. Mark off days. This visual progress is motivating.



\*\*The Real Magic:\*\*

After 30 days of consistent journaling, you'll notice something shift. You'll understand yourself better. You'll process emotions more easily. You'll have a record of your growth.



Start today. Find your tool. Set your time. Write three sentences. That's all you need.",1,1768241793.0,journalprompts,0,1.0,False
1qb2in7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qb2in7/how_to_be_a_better_girlfriend_brutal_truths_that/,How to be a better girlfriend: brutal truths that will make or break your relationship,"Everyone talks about how to *get* into a relationship. No one really talks about how to be *good* in one. Most of the advice floating around on TikTok or Instagram is just performative fluff: “Be his peace,” “Cook for him,” “Don’t complain too much.” Like, ok?? But what if being a “better” girlfriend has nothing to do with any of that?

A lot of people, especially in their 20s, are realizing that relationships unravel not because of cheating or huge fights, but because of a thousand tiny emotional misfires. It’s not usually villainy, it’s skill gaps. And the good news? Relationship skills can be learned. This post is packed with insights from legit sources, books, real research, and psychology podcasts. No IG therapy quotes, no “divine feminine energy” cringe-talk.

Here are hard skills that actually make someone amazing to be in a relationship with:

* **_Stop “supporting,” start co-regulating_**  
  Forget “being supportive.” It’s vague. What actually builds connection is emotional co-regulation, which is your ability to stay steady *with* your partner when they’re upset.  
  * *Psychologist Dr. Becky Kennedy* breaks this down beautifully on her podcast. Your nervous system affects theirs. If they’re spiraling and you get anxious or dismissive, it escalates. But if you stay grounded and present, their brain mirrors that.  
  * The Gottman Institute’s research shows that couples who manage conflict well actually turn toward each other emotionally *during* hard moments. That means being calm isn't passive. It's contagious.  

* **_Don’t be “chill,” be honest_**  
  The “cool girl” trope is dead. Over-accommodating out of fear of being “too much” just builds resentment.  
  * From *Terri Cole’s book “Boundary Boss,”* constantly minimizing your wants is not generosity. It’s self-abandonment. Real intimacy depends on clarity, not guessing games.  
  * Be upfront when something bothers you. But don’t dump it like a hot potato. Use the “self-focused” script: “I feel X when Y happens, because Z.” Not “You always do this.”  

* **_Learn your real attachment pattern (then manage it)_**  
  This is the relationship cheat code. Most of us think we have “baggage” or are just “weirdly emotional” but actually, we have stored nervous system patterns from childhood that play out in relationships.  
  * *Attached* by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller is a game-changer. It breaks down anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles. You realize, “Ohhh this is why I freak out when he doesn’t text back for 5 hours.”  
  * Knowing yours helps you soothe it *yourself*, instead of blaming your partner. That’s emotional maturity 101.

* **_You’re not his therapist, but you do shape his growth_**  
  No, you can’t “fix him.” But you do influence him. A lot.  
  * According to a 2022 study published in *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, partner responsiveness, how well partners respond to each other’s needs, has a long-term effect on emotional development.  
  * That means how you listen, validate, or respond during his messy moments might shift how vulnerable he’s willing to be, not just with you, but with himself.  

* **_Upgrade your “arguing” software_**  
  Fights are inevitable, but *how* you argue predicts if your relationship lasts. Cold fact: eye-rolls and passive-aggression are stronger predictors of a breakup than actual disagreements.  
  * The *Gottman Institute's “Four Horsemen”* model says contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling destroy relationships faster than cheating.  
  * Replace criticism with a “soft start” (“I noticed” instead of “you never”), and always repair after conflict. That’s what resets connection. Not who “wins” the argument.

* **_Be interesting to yourself_**  
  No one wants to be someone’s entire emotional ecosystem. You being obsessed with your own growth, hobbies, or learning journey is hot.  
  * Esther Perel, therapist and author, says “desire needs space.” Want to be magnetic in your relationship? Maintain a life outside of it.  
  * Read more. Try stuff alone. Follow your curiosity. You don’t need to become a mystery. You need to stay multidimensional.  

* **_Understand partner’s “love currency,” not just yours_**  
  Everyone talks about the 5 Love Languages like it’s old news, but many girlfriends forget the *real* point: your partner doesn’t think like you.  
  * *Dr. Gary Chapman*, author of the Love Languages, emphasizes the importance of adapting, not just expressing. You might love deep convos, they might just want a hug after work. Learn to speak *their* language fluently. That’s emotional fluency.

* **_Practice “micro-kindness” instead_**  
  Romantic grand gestures are rare. What actually makes people feel loved are micro-moments: remembering something small, checking in before a stressful day, or making coffee without a word.  
  * A study from Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program in collaboration with Gallup shows small daily acts of kindness had a larger impact on relationship satisfaction than big events.  

There’s zero shame if you didn’t know any of this. Most people never got taught how to actually do partnership well. Relationships are a skill, not a vibe. And being a “better girlfriend” isn’t about being easy or agreeable, it’s about being emotionally fluent, self-aware, and co-regulated.

1qb2iej,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoroccoBitchesWtaste/comments/1qb2iej/am_i_overreacting_for_ending_things_or_were_we/,"Am I overreacting for ending things, or were we just not on the same page?","I (F) met a guy at a mall a few months ago. He was visiting my city, asked for my number, and we grabbed coffee the next day before he left. We stayed in touch, and he came back to visit a couple of times. On his last two visits, we slept together.
He’s a basketball player and lives a few hours away. Most recently, he finished a game and drove about 3 hours to see me, which made me feel like he cared. I was excited and thought we’d spend quality time together. However, he kept shortening his stay, first saying he’d leave at 6pm, then earlier because of a massage/treatment, and eventually leaving much earlier than expected. We had breakfast and talked, but I left feeling disappointed and kind of used, like the main reason he came was sex.
Over time, I also noticed that most of our conversations centered around him. his training, his body, his games. When I showed care or said I liked him, he asked follow-up questions. But when I expressed that I wasn’t feeling good about the situation anymore, he didn’t really try to understand or talk it through. he just accepted it and said he wouldn’t “bother” me about it.
That contrast really hurt. It made me feel like my feelings mattered less than the attention I gave him.
I told him I don’t feel good about this anymore, and he said he understood but didn’t ask much beyond that. I chose not to continue the conversation or send any closure message.
Now I feel sad and second-guessing myself. Part of me wonders if he was just having a bad week or if I overreacted. Another part of me feels like I listened to my gut and ended something that wasn’t emotionally reciprocal.

From MoNews: Bilt has made it popular to earn rewards by paying rent. Now, founder and CEO, Ankur Jain, is revealing new details on the new Bilt credit cards that he says will bring premium options at a lower price than rival top rewards cards. @ ankurjain spoke with Mosheh Oinounou for the latest episode of the Mo News Podcast.

Bilt is rolling out three cards at three tiers next month - with annual fees of $0, $95, and $495. Jain argues that benefits of the $495 premium card will be the ""richest, most premium card on the market."" The American Express Platinum card annual fee recently went up to $895, while the Chase Sapphire Reserve card has a $795 fee.

Jain added that Bilt is also planning to not charge any transaction fees when customers use the card for rent and mortgages.

Bilt has a network of businesses — from coffee shops to yoga studios — beyond the 1 in 4 apartment buildings that the company partners with in the U.S., Jain said. With the rewards credit card, users can cash in at those local businesses.

""We've created Bilt Cash,"" he said. ""We're going to give people a way to not only earn points, but also cash back in our network on top of that.""

He says the goal is to turn everyday spending - where you live, eat, and shop - into rewards that actually add up.",5,1768241511.0,biltrewards,1,0.78,False

Our lawyer came with us since she had told us about the cases in the San Diego and Fresno offices. She said that we didn’t need to worry, she wanted us to be aware and prepared since it was not the norm at our field office (Chicago) but there was a possibility it COULD happen. 

We went to the building early to find parking and to ensure we weren’t late. At the entrance they ask you for the interview notice. Then you go through TSA-like screening. Do not bring liquids (coffee, water, etc.). Our lawyer checked in for us. We were called in about 1 hr later.

We did the oath. The officer asked for our full names, passports, and IDs. The officer asked when and where we met, when we started talking, and when we got married like 3x. They asked for our address. They asked about my partner’s child’s full name, their DOB, and where they lived (they don’t live with us). We were asked about our living situation, if we have a mortgage or pay rent. The beneficiary is not on the deed or mortgage and the officer asked us about it. They asked if we wanted to submit anything else, the lawyer handed out recent pictures from 2024-2025. The officer asked if the beneficiary was in any utility bills. We showed them the car insurance.

Then they proceeded to ask the regular questions they “have” to ask. We made some changes to the initial form because there were traffic citations that weren’t disclosed and some errors in addresses. They have a tablet to make the changes. The whole interview lasted around 35 minutes. The officer said they would give us a decision by the end of day. We were checking our emails often. The approval notice came in the next day while we were napping and woke up to the news.

Our lawyer said the interview was average. Nothing out of the ordinary. She said the officer was probably new bc it seemed like they didn’t realize we had the I-130 approval. 

We are not sure if it was us, but the silence between the questions was awkward AF. The officer was scrolling and scrolling and in our eyes you could see the tension. At some point we also got bored. I started to look at the drywall imperfections and the decorative items in the office.

If any of you have qs feel free to drop them below. We wish a speedy approval to your cases! 🫰🏻",0,1768241353.0,USCIS,1,0.5,False

Picked it up during high school because I apparently thought it was cinematic/cool however you name it. Now I am graduating from university in 6 months and decided that I can do better than that. I stopped smoking 3 days prior to New Year’s Eve but I set my actual quitting day as the NYE and allowed myself to smoke last time for the night. On Jan 5, my finals started all the stress and coffee made the conditions far from ideal but i somehow managed to not smoke any kind of tobacco. You know what? Conditions will never be ideal. If you want to find an excuse to smoke you will find it. If you decided to quit, just quit.

1qb2acc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qb2acc/my_boyfriend_lost_his_friendroommate_because_of_me/,My boyfriend lost his friend/roommate because of me,"There is nothing that can be done to resolve this issue or salvage what’s left of the friendship. I am just here to say it out loud because it’s caused me a lot of stress and frustration. Throwaway account and a few details are changed for privacy.

This involves myself (late 20’s female), my boyfriend (early 30’s male), and his ex roommate (early 30’s female).

At the time the friendship ending incident took place we had been dating for about 7 months. My boyfriend and I met organically at a dog park we both frequented and after chatting while the dogs played a few times we decided to get coffee. We went on that first date and were basically glued at the hip ever since. I was quickly introduced to his roommate we will call Frankie. She was nice but it was very awkward. It was awkward on both of our ends so I’m not going to put the uncomfortable atmosphere on her. That being said that was the only issue to my knowledge. This weird energy existed but we were both very nice to each other. When my boyfriend and I started dating I was suddenly around all of the time and I’m sure that was annoying to her. I was spending the night every  other weekend and hanging around a few afternoons a week. I have to travel for work so I was completely gone every couple weeks for about a week. So there was definitely a break in my presence. Also, I’m not sure if this detail matters to anyone but their roommate dynamic was not two people renting together. He owns the house and she rents one of the spare rooms. They have known each other for about 5 years but she had been living with him for 6 months when I came into the picture. So anyway, up until the incident there had never been an issue outside of her making comments now and again complaining that he spends all his time with me and they never hangout anymore. However I was gone for nearly half the month between work and travel and he would vent to me saying that she constantly complained they didn’t hangout but she never invited him to do anything while I was gone. He felt like she expected him to plan stuff and invite her but she never took the initiative. Also, she was constantly doing stuff with her friends and dating the entire time. The only time she seemed to ever extend an invite to him was the few times she had made plans with other people but they cancelled so she offered the open spot to him. He said he always felt like he was a default friend. So the day of the incident… I came over after work and there was crazy tension in the house. I heard them like whisper shouting across the house and then he came over to talk to me. She said one of her watches had been stolen along with some other small jewelry. The watch was worth like 4k and I’m not sure about the jewelry but probably a lot. She accused me of stealing everything. Of course I said didn’t because well, I didn’t. But she refused to accept any other possibility. Now here is where I got really upset. She loses EVERYTHING. Keys, phones, cash, chargers, it’s literally an ongoing issue. In fact she even made jokes about how fun it is when she finds “lost” items hidden in her room that she forgot she hid and it feels like finding treasure. When I first met them she was super upset and crying because she lost a thousand dollar birthday check from a family member and a few months later found it hidden inside a book in her room. So I was incredibly insulted and hurt that I was accused to stealing when I’ve never shown any signs of theft but she never considered she just misplaced the items because that’s a constant pattern for her. Ultimately she ended up moving out and guess what? While she was unpacking at her new apartment she fucking found the watch and jewelry. She had in fact hidden it and it turned up later. She let us know. I appreciated the honesty but the whole thing ruined their friendship. My boyfriend stood by me the entire time and said he knew I wouldn’t have done that. I also want to add that it does make sense that if an item goes missing you’re going to assume the new stranger took it. However we had several large parties, we each had several small get togethers, and many different single people inside the home between when she had last seen the watch and realized it was gone. There were literally at least 60 different people inside the house between her friends, his, and mine who could have done it. She refused to consider anybody but me. That really hurt. She moved out because she said she wasn’t safe around me. After she found the watch I fully forgave her and was ready to turn a new leaf. Anyway that didn’t last long because shortly after we found out she was talking really poorly of me. So the friendship is totally dead now. I just don’t understand how all this happened. It haunts me, it confuses me, it feels fake. I feel like by just being here and existing my boyfriend lost a dear friend. Anyway… that’s it.",3,1768241234.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1qb2a6j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qb2a6j,How/Why Trains in RFV,"We've all experienced the unfortunate traffic and standing room only buses in the RFV. The transit is improving, but rail has the ability to move a larger volume of people per vehicle and not have to deal with traffic delays as well as deal with weather delays less often due to rails vs road. Trains are expensive, but there is a way that we can use the higher rents disproportionately high rate of traffic compared to other population centers of this size to the advantage of train access. 

Land Value Capture is a means of funding public transit without it coming out of the fare box or taxes. The fact that the Rio Grand ROW is not at central town points works to our advantage here, as RFTA could build new mixed use residential housing and business fronts. With three floors of housing and a floor of cafe/restaurant/convenience stores, RFTA could collect a fair amount of business rent revenue while providing fair wage housing. Transit stations have a reliably large number of people moving through them every day, who are all potential customers. And having a convenient place to get your coffee/breakfast as you wait for the train makes everything about transit easier and more convenient. All while providing high quality housing for local employees (including transit employees), and a higher rate of tax revenue per acre for the town. 

A given bus can move around 40 people, and a train with three cars can move a couple hundred. While the frequency of rail may not be as high due to up front costs of trainsets, this is not intended to immediately replace the BRT service, but enhance it. This also does not mean we should get rid of any bus services that exist, but instead use any busses that the train makes unnecessary to expand transit coverage. This would spread the public transit load around and make travel far easier during major events such as XGames as well. 

Our major bus stops, many of them at least, are already not in city centers. They are at park and ride locations. The Carbondale bus stop would be a brilliant upgrade with a train coming through it, as well as housing and businesses built around it. By building better bike parking more people could take bikes to get there and reduce the need for as much car parking. This might also work at 27th St Station as the density is already increasing there and the pedestrian bridge between the Rio Grande ROW to the Bus Stop already exists. Abolishing mandatory parking minimums *would allow* the northern Walmart parking lot to turn into Park And Ride space if the 27th St Bus Parking was turned into a 3 story building with housing and businesses. Though Walmart may not be keen on this. There is also space, even if not necessarily interest by land holders, to do the same at West Glenwood if there was a train from Glenwood Springs to Grand Junction/Fruita.

El Jebel, Willits, and Basalt train stop locations would be further away from current BRT stops. This is where it would be easier for RFTA to build housing/commercial front spaces in some ways. And as it stands, a lot of people are currently driving to the bus stops anyways. People driving to a train stop isn't out of the picture because of this. In fact, it would allow either more park and ride space, or allow more of the current park and ride lots to be turned into Land Value Capture opportunities. This could be true for the El Jebel lot, and some of the area around Willits. Especially with the abolishment of Mandatory Parking Minimums. 

The easiest thing to do first would be rail from Glenwood Springs to Grand Junction. Connecting all of the Roaring Form Valley to Grand Junction would allow the Grand Junction Airport to handle more flights and local residents to have access to a more reliable airport. It only takes 10 more minutes by rail than by car, according to Amtrak time tables. This would cut down the congestion issues in Glenwood Springs and bring some new life into downtown Glenwood, Old Town New Castle, Rifle, etc. Along with making it easier to recreate in these areas, especially for cyclists. More importantly, with people commuting all the way to Aspen and Snowmass from Rifle and even Parachute, it would make the lives of these people easier. 

There are examples of snowsports area corridors with fewer locals having train services. The Hoch  Pustertal in the Dolomites of Italy is one of these. You can take the train from chairlift to chairlift of two major snowsports areas there. As well as some other towns and minor snowsports areas. The forst photo is the Gondola station at Kronplatz, taken from the train. The second photo is Drei Zinnen, taken from a restaurant at the base of a chairlift towards the train station. We could do this here, and take hundreds to thousands of tourists off of local roads by providing easy rail access from Grand Junction to Aspen, and even from Grand Junction to Glenwood Springs, or as far as Avon though the tracks to Avon aren't currently in operable condition. Innsbruck Austria is a brilliant example of a major rail hub in a mountain town that connects to other snowsports areas and major cities so that you don't have to arrive in the mountains by car as a tourist. 

Good rail service also makes it easier for tourists to use hotels in other towns, cutting the cost of tourism for many. Bringing in people who would come here because they love the sports we love rather than adding to the scene of ""I'm here to show off being in Aspen."" All while making more housing and local business opportunities for the people who work here. And the more people who can feel comfortable living in the valley without cars, again the fewer cars on the road. ",2,1768241225.0,roaringfork,3,1.0,False

Fast forward and this thing has been through absolute chaos. Spilled coffee more times than I can count, muddy shoes, moving apartments, pets deciding it was their personal nap spot, even a couple of deep cleans that I was sure would finish it off.

Somehow it still looks good. Not perfect, but in that way where it feels earned. The fibers bounced back, no weird bald spots, no unraveling at the edges. It actually looks better now than when it was brand new, like it settled into itself.

I never really thought about rugs as a buy it for life kind of item, but this one changed my mind. Makes me wonder how many other wool things are quietly outlasting everything else in my house while I keep replacing cheaper stuff over and over.",1,1768241174.0,ProductQuery,0,1.0,False

Eat a pretty sandwich, as big as a beach.

Parade with a loaf of bread, on a lion's head,

Find a purple bear, and hop on instead.

Hide a pen in my hair, break into Martian square,

Where the clouds rain coffee, and the trees grow toffee.

1qb2744,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qb2744,My Prom With Zangief,"I didn’t expect prom to feel like this. I’d planned for it to be a mission—show up, smile, endure the music, disappear. Instead, there was Zangief at my door, enormous and nervous in a tux that looked like it had been afraid of *him* first, hiding flowers behind his back as if I might not notice the world’s largest man trying to be subtle. I remember the way my face felt when I saw him through the window—hot, ridiculous, smiling without permission. I hadn’t trained for that.

Everything after blurred in a glittering rush. The limo lights, the gym glowing like a movie set, everyone transformed—Guile impossibly sharp in a tux, Bison smug and polished, Chun-Li radiant in blue. When the music hit and Dhalsim started spinning tracks, something cracked open. Zangief danced like joy itself had grabbed him by the shoulders, and somehow I was right there with him, laughing, spinning, shouting over the noise. It didn’t feel like fighting anymore. It felt like being *allowed* to be loud.

The after-party sank us into something warmer and messier. Guile’s basement smelled like old carpet and bad decisions. Controllers everywhere. Shouting. Triumph. Absolute betrayal when someone stole a win at the last second. Zangief’s jacket vanished, my hair followed shortly after, and the world narrowed to a glowing screen and four people who suddenly felt like a team in a different way. I don’t remember who won. I remember laughing so hard my ribs hurt.

By the time the movie came on, the night had finally caught up with us. Pajamas, blankets, the TV painting everything in soft blue. I curled into Zangief without thinking, his warmth solid and safe, the rise and fall of his chest steady beneath my cheek. Somewhere behind us Guile did something loud and deeply unwise with a beer bong. No one cared. We were half-asleep, together, and that was enough.

Now it’s morning. Bacon snapping in the pan, coffee breathing steam into the air, orange juice catching the light. I didn’t realize how domestic happiness would ambush me—an apron tied at my waist, Zangief watching me like I’m the most dangerous thing in the room, hearts practically written all over his face. Guile’s nursing a headache the size of a tank, Bison’s pretending the paper still matters, Chun-Li’s solving Wordle like it’s a life-or-death puzzle.

I flip an egg, smile to myself, and think:

Recently I commissioned the one-and-only (@gabbiecasso) for some of her ***stunning*** art to help bring my story to life. Since I saw some of it posted here already, I figured I'd drop the rest with the context added, as well the full-story linked below if you are interested.

**-- This part takes place for the second art frame. --**

The living room was bathed in the low, amber light of the floor lamp, casting long, soft shadows against the walls. Robert lowered himself down first with a groan that was equal parts pain and relief, his battered muscles singing in gratitude as the worn cushions swallowed him up.

 

""Old man noises already?"" Mandy teased, setting the plate of cookies on the coffee table beside the wine bottle.

 

""Strategic vocalizations,"" he corrected, gingerly shifting his hips to find a position that didn't aggravate his ribs. ""I'm communicating my displeasure with gravity.""

 

Mandy grabbed the remote and flopped down next to him—close, but with a distinct gap of ""polite company"" between them. Beef, however, had no such concept of personal space. The dog scrambled up immediately, turning three tight circles before collapsing across both their feet, effectively pinning them in place.

 

""Trapped,"" Mandy whispered, hitting the power button.

 

The screen flared to life, instantly filling the room with the jarringly bright, saturated colors of reality television. A dramatic violin swell announced the return of The Altar Ultimatum.

 

""Okay, catch me up,"" Robert said, grabbing a warm cookie. ""Why is that man crying in a helicopter?""

 

""That’s Chad. He’s crying because Mary said his aura was 'too beige' during the group date,"" Mandy explained with deadly seriousness, tucking her legs up underneath her, which naturally angled her body toward his. ""And now he has to choose between the influencer who hates dogs or the girl who thinks she's a mermaid reincarnated.""

 

""He should choose the parachute,"" Robert muttered, taking a bite. The chocolate was still molten, rich and sweet, a stark contrast to the insipid drama unfolding on the screen. ""Eject. Abort mission. Save yourself, Chad.""

 

""Shh,"" she nudged his shoulder lightly. ""He's going for the rose!""

 

As the episode droned on, a rhythmic lull settled over the room. They traded quips and critiques, at first deconstructing the contestants' life choices with the cynical precision of two people who dealt with actual life-and-death stakes daily. But as the season finale approached on screen, the banter shifted. The air grew thicker, heavier, charged with the same electricity that had been interrupted in the bathroom.

 

On the screen, the music swelled—violins crying out in a minor key. Chad, the stoic bachelor, stood on a rain-slicked platform, staring at the woman waiting for him. He was hesitating. The camera zoomed in on his conflicted face, then cut to hers—hopeful, terrified, waiting.

 

""God,"" Mandy sighed, the sound sharp with frustration. She took a sip of her wine, her eyes glued to the screen. ""Look at her face. She's practically begging him to say it. Does he think she’s blind? She chose him weeks ago.""

 

""It's not that simple,"" Robert muttered, staring at the man on the screen. He saw the hesitation not as weakness, but as a calculation of damage. ""He's got a past. He knows what he's dragging her into. Maybe he's trying to give her an out before it's too late.""

 

Mandy turned her head slightly, her gaze drifting from the TV to Robert’s profile. ""An out? She doesn't want an out. She wants *him*. Why is that so hard for him to believe?"" She gestured bewildered to the woman on-screen.

 

""Because looking at her..."" Robert gestured vaguely with his cookie, his voice dropping low, ""she looks like a *future*. And he feels like a wreckage. Maybe he thinks she deserves the version of him that isn't... damaged. The version that doesn't wake up screaming.""

 

The room went quiet. The dialogue on the TV became a murmur in the background. Robert realized, with a sudden, cold clarity, that he wasn't talking about the show anymore. He felt the heat of Mandy's leg pressed against his, the weight of her stare on the side of his face.

 

""She doesn't want perfect, Robert,"" Mandy said softly. Her voice wasn't directed at the screen. ""She knows exactly what she's signing up for. She's seen the scars. And she's still standing there, waiting in the rain.""

 

Robert tightened his grip on the stem of his wine glass, defending the man on the screen—defending himself. ""He, - he doesn't know that. If he breaks her heart, if the damage is too much, he loses the only good thing he has left.""

 

""Or,"" Mandy countered, shifting so she was fully facing him now, ignoring the climax of the episode entirely. ""He waits too long. He stays silent to 'protect' her, and he loses her anyway because he was too afraid to take the win.""

 

Robert finally tore his eyes away from the television. He looked at her. Really looked at her. The blue light from the screen washed over her face, highlighting the challenge in her dark eyes. There was no pretense left. The show was forgotten.

 

Mandy leaned in, just an inch, closing the distance between their worlds.

 

""What about you?"" she purred, her voice dropping to a velvety hush. ""If you were in his shoes... what would you do?""

 

Robert looked at her lips, then up to her eyes.

 

For a heartbeat, the old reflex kicked in—the urge to deflect, to crack a self-deprecating joke and retreat behind the safety of the mask. It was his standard operating procedure: keep it light, keep it funny, keep them at arm’s length so they don't see the cracks in the armor. It was easier to be the punchline than the prize, especially when he looked at himself and saw only bruises, bad decisions, while she looked like... well, like *her*.

 

But before he could force a smile, the noise in his head shifted. It wasn't his own doubt anymore; it was her voice, echoing from memories he’d kept on replay.

 

*""I'm not done saving you yet.""*

He remembered the weight of those words, the fierce determination in her eyes when she'd pulled him back from the brink, refusing to let him sink when he was at his lowest. He thought about the quiet confession she’d shared once, a moment of vulnerability she rarely showed the world. 

The realization hit him harder than anything Shroud had thrown at him that day. She wasn't looking at the hero, she never did. She didn't see Mecha Man, or the Z-Team leader, or the man always trying to use humor to avoid feeling too hurt. She always just saw *him*, Robert, just as he was. She had seen the man behind the mask first, and somehow, against all his calculations, she had stayed.

 

""I'd do a lot different,"" he admitted, his voice rough with a sudden, overwhelming honesty.

 

Mandy held his gaze, her pupils blowing wide. She didn't smile; this wasn't a joke anymore.

 

""Show me,"" she whispered.

TL;DR- Great stay! Received all listed benefits (after some nudging) and would happily return.

Prior to Check In

My $250 edit credit posted same day that the transaction posted.

I called the hotel a few days after booking to ask what type of breakfast was included and how I can link the reservation to my World of Hyatt account since Chase says it is WOH eligible. The hotel linked the reservation while on the call and it showed in my Hyatt app almost instantly. 

The week of check-in I noticed the app listed my visit as “2 adults, 2 rooms, 2 nights” even though I only booked for 1 room. I called the hotel to make sure they didn’t have me down for 2 rooms. They did not, so it seemed to be a glitch in the app. While they had me on the phone they asked when I’d arrive (1:30pm) so that they could request an early check in for me. Very nice touch! 

***

My Actual Stay 

Arrived around 1:30pm and the room wasn’t ready yet, they said they would call me when it was ready. I inquired about how to claim the included breakfast and there was a little confusion because she didn’t see that I booked through the Edit program. Must have just been an oversight because it didn’t take long for them to see it and handed me an envelope that had my name on it with my benefit information. I left my baggage with the bellmen and walked around Central Park until I got the call at 2:26pm that the room was ready. Baggage was already delivered to my room upon my arrival. 

I was upgraded to a city view king room. It was really nice and spacious with a great view of Carnegie Hall. 

We got daily housekeeping plus turn down service. On our second day, we still had not received a welcome amenity so I called guest relations to ask about it. At first they said my reservation does not include an amenity but when they looked it up they saw the full Edit benefits. They placed me on a brief hold and apologized for the technical difficulty and confirmed something would be sent up. Later when we returned to the room they had delivered the following: 
* Harvey & Harriet Red Blend
* Chocolate Bon Bon
* Evian Still Water
* Evian Sparkling Water 

I noticed for the two breakfasts, we were being charged for the coffees we ordered (latte & and iced coffee) and were told those are not included in the 57th street breakfast. However at checkout, the staff member adjusted to bill to only charge us the overage from our dinner in their restaurant. Waiving all other breakfast related fees without being asked. She was also the friendliest staff member of the trip!

1qb25bu,https://v.redd.it/lhg84wl4kycg1,Just launched my app - built it because I was spending 2 hours a day on spreadsheets,"Hey everyone

After mass lurking here for months, I finally have something to share. Just launched Metricx on Product Hunt today.

Quick backstory: I've run ads for my own brands/stores for 3 years. I got so frustrated with the tab-switching and spreadsheets that i had to fill in to know if im profitable and wich campaigns are performing good right now.

Just answering ""which campaigns should I kill today?"" took 30-45 minutes. It's brutal.

The real thing that drove me crazy though is when i'm out getting coffee or when at the gym, i want to check my numbers, not just shopify revenue. I want to see actual campaign-level stats. Wich adsets are spending? What's my ROAS per campaign looking like right now? are my new creatives converting or do i need to kill?

If you run ad accounts on proxies(and let's be real, most of the guys that are dropshipping do), you literally cannot check your ads unless you're on your laptop with things like icogniton open. You are literally flying blind until your at your desk. That's insane, especially when spending thousands a day.

**What I built:**

Metricx connects your Meta and Google ad accounts and lets you ask questions like you're talking to a colleague:

* *""Which ad sets are burning money?""*
* *""Show me everything with ROAS below 2 that's spent more than $100""*
* *""Compare Campaign A vs Campaign B last 7 days""*
* *""What should I turn off?""*

The AI actually understands campaign structures, it knows what ad sets are, how to calculate ROAS, how to compare date ranges. It's not just keyword matching.

What used to take me 30+ minutes now takes about 10 seconds. I'm not exaggerating. I use it every single day for my own accounts. And I can finally check real campaign stats from my phone - no proxy, no laptop, no BS. Just pull it up and ask ""how are my ads doing today?""

**The build**

* 6 months building
* Solo founder (shoutout Claude)
* Stack: Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL

You just connect your ad accounts and start asking questions. Value in 60 seconds.

Also, i'm looking for 10 founding merchants who are actively running Meta/Google ads and want to help shape this thing. You get lifetime free access, I get honest feedback and help prioritizing features.

DM me if that sounds interesting.

For everyone else: I launched Metricx on Product Hunt today if you want to check it out and show some love. Happy to answer any questions!

Recently I commissioned the one-and-only (@gabbiecasso) for some of her ***stunning*** art to help bring my story to life. Since I saw some of it posted here already, I figured I'd drop the rest with the context added, as well the full-story linked below if you are interested.

**-- This part takes place for the second art frame. --**

The living room was bathed in the low, amber light of the floor lamp, casting long, soft shadows against the walls. Robert lowered himself down first with a groan that was equal parts pain and relief, his battered muscles singing in gratitude as the worn cushions swallowed him up.

 

""Old man noises already?"" Mandy teased, setting the plate of cookies on the coffee table beside the wine bottle.

 

""Strategic vocalizations,"" he corrected, gingerly shifting his hips to find a position that didn't aggravate his ribs. ""I'm communicating my displeasure with gravity.""

 

Mandy grabbed the remote and flopped down next to him—close, but with a distinct gap of ""polite company"" between them. Beef, however, had no such concept of personal space. The dog scrambled up immediately, turning three tight circles before collapsing across both their feet, effectively pinning them in place.

 

""Trapped,"" Mandy whispered, hitting the power button.

 

The screen flared to life, instantly filling the room with the jarringly bright, saturated colors of reality television. A dramatic violin swell announced the return of The Altar Ultimatum.

 

""Okay, catch me up,"" Robert said, grabbing a warm cookie. ""Why is that man crying in a helicopter?""

 

""That’s Chad. He’s crying because Mary said his aura was 'too beige' during the group date,"" Mandy explained with deadly seriousness, tucking her legs up underneath her, which naturally angled her body toward his. ""And now he has to choose between the influencer who hates dogs or the girl who thinks she's a mermaid reincarnated.""

 

""He should choose the parachute,"" Robert muttered, taking a bite. The chocolate was still molten, rich and sweet, a stark contrast to the insipid drama unfolding on the screen. ""Eject. Abort mission. Save yourself, Chad.""

 

""Shh,"" she nudged his shoulder lightly. ""He's going for the rose!""

 

As the episode droned on, a rhythmic lull settled over the room. They traded quips and critiques, at first deconstructing the contestants' life choices with the cynical precision of two people who dealt with actual life-and-death stakes daily. But as the season finale approached on screen, the banter shifted. The air grew thicker, heavier, charged with the same electricity that had been interrupted in the bathroom.

 

On the screen, the music swelled—violins crying out in a minor key. Chad, the stoic bachelor, stood on a rain-slicked platform, staring at the woman waiting for him. He was hesitating. The camera zoomed in on his conflicted face, then cut to hers—hopeful, terrified, waiting.

 

""God,"" Mandy sighed, the sound sharp with frustration. She took a sip of her wine, her eyes glued to the screen. ""Look at her face. She's practically begging him to say it. Does he think she’s blind? She chose him weeks ago.""

 

""It's not that simple,"" Robert muttered, staring at the man on the screen. He saw the hesitation not as weakness, but as a calculation of damage. ""He's got a past. He knows what he's dragging her into. Maybe he's trying to give her an out before it's too late.""

 

Mandy turned her head slightly, her gaze drifting from the TV to Robert’s profile. ""An out? She doesn't want an out. She wants *him*. Why is that so hard for him to believe?"" She gestured bewildered to the woman on-screen.

 

""Because looking at her..."" Robert gestured vaguely with his cookie, his voice dropping low, ""she looks like a *future*. And he feels like a wreckage. Maybe he thinks she deserves the version of him that isn't... damaged. The version that doesn't wake up screaming.""

 

The room went quiet. The dialogue on the TV became a murmur in the background. Robert realized, with a sudden, cold clarity, that he wasn't talking about the show anymore. He felt the heat of Mandy's leg pressed against his, the weight of her stare on the side of his face.

 

""She doesn't want perfect, Robert,"" Mandy said softly. Her voice wasn't directed at the screen. ""She knows exactly what she's signing up for. She's seen the scars. And she's still standing there, waiting in the rain.""

 

Robert tightened his grip on the stem of his wine glass, defending the man on the screen—defending himself. ""He, - he doesn't know that. If he breaks her heart, if the damage is too much, he loses the only good thing he has left.""

 

""Or,"" Mandy countered, shifting so she was fully facing him now, ignoring the climax of the episode entirely. ""He waits too long. He stays silent to 'protect' her, and he loses her anyway because he was too afraid to take the win.""

 

Robert finally tore his eyes away from the television. He looked at her. Really looked at her. The blue light from the screen washed over her face, highlighting the challenge in her dark eyes. There was no pretense left. The show was forgotten.

 

Mandy leaned in, just an inch, closing the distance between their worlds.

 

""What about you?"" she purred, her voice dropping to a velvety hush. ""If you were in his shoes... what would you do?""

 

Robert looked at her lips, then up to her eyes.

 

For a heartbeat, the old reflex kicked in—the urge to deflect, to crack a self-deprecating joke and retreat behind the safety of the mask. It was his standard operating procedure: keep it light, keep it funny, keep them at arm’s length so they don't see the cracks in the armor. It was easier to be the punchline than the prize, especially when he looked at himself and saw only bruises, bad decisions, while she looked like... well, like *her*.

 

But before he could force a smile, the noise in his head shifted. It wasn't his own doubt anymore; it was her voice, echoing from memories he’d kept on replay.

 

*""I'm not done saving you yet.""*

He remembered the weight of those words, the fierce determination in her eyes when she'd pulled him back from the brink, refusing to let him sink when he was at his lowest. He thought about the quiet confession she’d shared once, a moment of vulnerability she rarely showed the world. 

The realization hit him harder than anything Shroud had thrown at him that day. She wasn't looking at the hero, she never did. She didn't see Mecha Man, or the Z-Team leader, or the man always trying to use humor to avoid feeling too hurt. She always just saw *him*, Robert, just as he was. She had seen the man behind the mask first, and somehow, against all his calculations, she had stayed.

 

""I'd do a lot different,"" he admitted, his voice rough with a sudden, overwhelming honesty.

 

Mandy held his gaze, her pupils blowing wide. She didn't smile; this wasn't a joke anymore.

 

""Show me,"" she whispered.

My friend's partner looked through his phone and found our chat, so she messaged ME and asked that we do not see each other anymore and reminded me that he was in a relationship. Our messages to each other were friendly - as in you can tell we're friends, but nothing out of the ordinary. Most recent messages were me congratulating him on an achievement, and him asking if I was free for lunch at some point. For context, he is my work friend (we work at different branches, so I see him in person like once every two months), he was flirty with me in the past and I've always turned him down and I've made clear my views on affairs, it is one of the worst things you can do to another person. We grab coffee or lunch together sometimes and I enjoy talking about work with him, it's the topic of most our conversations. On the few occasions when he did complain to me about her, I took her side and changed the topic quickly. I've known him almost as long as she's known him (5-6 years), but I gather she didn't know I existed until fairly recently which is odd because I've met her at a work event and we chatted, and I thought she was pretty and otherwise a nice person. I felt a bit shit when I first read her message and her attempt to guilt trip me. Impulsively, I wrote ""You have nothing to worry about, unlike you, I have no interest in married men"" (she started as his mistress, his ex-wife dumped him when she found out). I didn't have the courage to send it, it's maybe a bit mean?

Because on some level I feel sorry for her, but probably like she didn't consider his ex-wife, I don't feel I owe her anything more than what I've already done. I'm not interested in him in that way, if he fancied me then that is something she needs to address with him, not with me. I feel as if I should reassure her or just agree to not seeing him outside of work, but I want to avoid a situation where the more I explain myself the more guilty I look. Part of me also wants to send the message as is because intrusive thoughts are winning....

  
Edit: to say, I feel sorry for her because given how they started, she probably is very insecure ",6,1768240804.0,AskWomenOver30,18,0.8,False

For context, was out at two bars this weekend (one high end, one a typical restaurant bar) and noticed that the foam at both bars lasted the duration of the drink rather than fading after a few sips. The foam at both bars was also more bubbly/had tiny air pockets compared to the smooth foam I usually get.

My current process for making two drinks (almost always am making two at once) is:

1) Chill coupes in freezer

2) Combine 4 oz Vodka, 2 oz Hot Espresso (fresh from Nespresso machine), 1 oz of Kahlua (might swap with Mr. Black soon) and 1/2 oz Simple Syrup in small tin

3) Shake with two large cubes (picked this up from Reddit comments)

4) Double strain into chilled coupes 

5) Serve with coffee bean garnish

They come out looking great but the foam does not last. Have tinkered with reverse dry shaking/using a milk frother before adding ice, but have had little luck. Open to tinkering with the recipe or type of espresso used. Have also considered ordering Fee Foam to brute force it. Would appreciate any pointers! ",1,1768240745.0,cocktails,3,1.0,False

1qb1ypr,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1qb1ypr/time_looped_chapter_188/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 188,"Returning to the start of a loop never was easy. When predictions were involved, the shock was all that much greater. Part of Will’s mind had become used to restarting in the dirty basement with Spenser standing nearby. The school building seemed outright alien, making him freeze up for a few moments to make sense of everything.

“Move it, weirdo,” Jess said in her usual harsh tone as she walked by.

“Sorry.” Will turned towards her. “I…”

 

**JESS ALEXANDRA KRAKOW (Former participant)**

**Current Skills:**

**MEMORIES OF ETERNITY**

 

Will never finished his sentence, focusing on the words floating over the girl’s head. He already knew that she had been part of eternity in the past, as well as that she had retained her memory, but seeing it presented in such fashion was disturbing.

“You what?” The girl stopped, looking back. Despite trying to hide it, there was a note of concern in her voice.

Even after she had been cast out, eternity still considered her part of it. Maybe there weren’t any former participants, only those that had lost their skills. It would have been interesting to see what Danny’s description would be, or Alex’s for that matter before he had returned to the game.

“I didn’t mean to be an ass.” After hundreds of loops the rogue class had rubbed off on the boy, granting him composure and a degree of charm of his own. “I’ll make it up to you.”

“Jess,” Ely said, in a disapproving fashion. “We’ll be *late* for class.”

Will looked at the second girl.

 

**ELYAN WINTERS (Former participant)**

**Current Skills:**

**MEMORIES OF ETERNITY**

 

The same explanation floated above her as well. Eternity wasn’t sentimental enough to mention what either’s former class was.

“I’ll be fine.” Jess stepped away.

The trio had done a good job forming a bottleneck on the path to school. Many arrivals weren’t particularly pleased about it, but for the moment didn’t voice any complaints.

“Meet up this afternoon?” Will smiled. “I know a great coffee shop that makes chocolate mousse.”

“We’re busy—” Ely began, only to be harshly interrupted.

“Fine,” Jess accepted without hesitation. “You better not stay me up.” The turn made her way into the school building. Ely gave Will a warning glare, then did the same.

Internally, Will felt pity for the temp version of him that would have to go on with this after the loop. Although, there was always a chance that things would work out. Both of them could discuss eternity at this point, and there were no destructive events planned for the current loop. With a bit of luck, they might even get to go steady. That wasn’t his concern, though.

Rushing in, the boy went to the bathroom and reclaimed his rogue class. Without wasting a moment, he then went into the hallway, looking at everyone around.

No other floating messages came into sight. Apparently, Alex’s original group were the only people who had gotten involved with eternity. That couldn’t be right, though. Neither of the four had been the first owners of their classes, and unless all mirrors had been moved, only people in the general vicinity had to be.

“Anything the matter, Mister Stone?” The large figure of the coach walked up to him. The man had his arms crossed, looking at Will with a deep frown on his forehead.

“No, coach,” Will quickly replied. “Just feeling a bit dizzy.”

“Dizzy.” The coach had heard all sorts of excuses, and this was among the weakest he could remember.

“Nothing serious,” Will quickly waved it away. “Shouldn’t have skipped breakfast.”

“Skipping breakfast…” the man remained just as skeptical as before. “Just get out of here.”

In a slightly rushed stroll, Will moved along. The scene wasn’t big enough to attract much attention. A few people made a few offhand comments, then continued to their classrooms. Will did the same.

“About time, Stoner,” Jace greeted him with the usual grunt. “At least come on time to get your prize.”

*Prize?* Will thought.

It took him a while to remember the paladin tokens he had been promised. It had been a while since that conversation had been held, not that it was the greatest distraction. Looking at the Jace, the entire list of permanent skills was visible.

Quietly, the jock had managed to boost his class level all the way to seven and lied about it on several occasions. Just a few loops ago, he had complained that he wasn’t even halfway up. Either he had completed his solo challenge a lot better than Will gave him credit for, or outside assistance was involved. Since this was eternity, likely a bit of both. Over a dozen random skills were also visible. Part of them Will had a hand in earning. None of them particularly stood out. Jace’s luck, as well as his usefulness to Alex and the archer, wasn’t that good to earn him anything special. He was just a run-of-the-mill participant who grew with time and effort. Helen, on the other hand, was completely different.

For starters, she had amassed so many skills that Will couldn’t read them all without it becoming obvious that he was doing something out of the ordinary. There were so many that he couldn’t even differentiate between her class skills and the rest. One thing in particular attracted his attention: the word RANKER placed immediately after her name.

*Helen was a ranker?* Will wasn’t sure how to react.

His initial reaction was to defend her. Logically, that was perfectly within expectations. Back when she was defending Danny, she was part of the reward phase. Though in that case, why had she pretended not to know about it all this time? If Alex were here now, he’d probably comment on how she had played not only Jace and Danny, but the acrobat and the entire alliance of nine.

“Yeah, sorry,” Will said, maintaining a level expression. “Last loop was rough.”

“Oh?” Helen looked at him. “What happened?”

“Had to make a deal with Spenser.” There was no point in hiding that bit. “At some point he might collect.”

“That fucker?” Jace spat out of the open window. “Was it worth it?”

“I’ll find out during the reward phase,” the rogue lied. “Did I tell you about the deal with the archer?”

“Wow, Stoner. That must have been some loop. But yeah, Hel filled me in. Ten days… hope you have a plan for that.”

“No worries, bro!” Alex appeared from the corner of the room only to have Jace instinctively grab the nearest chair and throw it at him.

The thief didn’t move an inch, calmly getting hit and shattering as a result.

“Not cool, bro.” Another Alex appeared.

“Fuck you, muffin boy!” the jock shouted, pointing angrily at him.

No skill description was visible above the goofball, but Will didn’t expect there to be. Despite having all of their creator’s skills, mirror copies were the equivalent of air. As far as the eye was concerned, they didn’t exist. It would be too easy for Alex to reveal any information so easily. Even so, there was one vital piece of information he had let slip: now Will was instantly able to tell which Alex was a copy and which—the real thing.

“Nice to have you show up,” Helen greeted the thief in her best icy tone.

“For real, sis? And leave my bros and you hanging? Nah.” The mirror copy went to the tossed chair and picked it up. “Deal is sus, though.”

“Sus?” Will asked.

“Ten days in the contest phase? Most of the players get ooofed the first week. If we can make it ten days, we can make it to the end.”

“Can we kill the archer?” Will asked without hesitation.

For once, that was a question that Alex couldn’t openly answer.

“It’s the best deal we’ll get. Next reward phase, I’ll listen to your plan.”

“I got you, bro.” Alex didn’t argue. “You’re the leader.”

*Right.* Will sighed internally. *I’m the leader.*

He couldn’t help but feel that Alex had already gone through this, thousands of loops ago and was now mocking him.

“Most of the challenges have been claimed,” Helen said, ending the discussing and bringing the group back on topic. “The only ones that are left are a few solos and the dragon challenge. Please tell me you don’t plan on doing that.”

The smile on her face suggested that she was joking. In his current situation, Will didn’t catch her humor.

“We leave that for next time,” he said, the joke flying over his head. “For this one, we need training.”

Silence filled the room.

“Training?” Jace asked.

“We can’t solo this. We need to fight as a team, and for that, we need practice. Alex—” he turned to the goofball “—can your freeze thing help us train?”

“Sure, bro. Just not against anything that moves.”

Not an ideal situation without a doubt.

“Then we’ll have to use the wolf challenge,” Will said.

“About that…” It was Jace’s turn to rain on the parade. “That’s gone.”

“Gone?” Will blinked.

“The mirror’s been gone for a while. Even the key broke.”

Helen quickly tapped her mirror fragment.

“He’s right,” she said, sliding her finger along the smooth surface. “My key is gone as well.”

“When did that happen?”

From what Will remembered, the mirror had stayed behind after he had completed it. Or was he remembering wrong? In his mind, he was certain of having conversations with each of them about the waves of wolves and advising them how to reach the end. Sadly, it was just as possible for that to never have happened. At best, there was a chance that the paradox loop had changed a thing or two, rendering the challenge unavailable.

“We can do merchant challenges?” Alex suggested.

“Shut up, muffin boy,” Jace hissed. “I’m not dealing with snakes and crows.”

The option didn’t seem particularly appealing to anyone. Will grabbed the mirror fragment around his neck and looked in. Quite a few hidden challenges were visible, though all of them were on a countdown timer, suggesting they wouldn’t become active for days. Unlike before, the reveal requirements were also present, including the classes needed to enter them. That was how Danny had cheated in the past. Yet, the question remained: who had told him about the eyes? Thinking back, maybe Will should have tried to get a few more answers from Gabriel.

“Some hidden challenges will pop up,” he said. “That’ll be seven loops, though.”

“And until then?” The jock seemed unusually confrontational lately, even more than his usual self.

“Till then, we do our thing. Unless anyone has something in mind?”

The boy looked at everyone in turn. Both Helen and Alex had expressed a desire to be with him for their own purposes. To no surprise, none of them admitted a thing.

“Don’t look at me,” Jace grumbled. “I’ll be in the library.”

“For real, bro?” Alex stared at him.

“It helps with crafting!” The jock said defensively.

The classroom door opened, marking the end of all discussions. A few minutes later, class started again.

Events were the same as they had always been. Will spend part of the time casually sketching the same picture he had done hundreds of times. As he did, he constantly glanced at his mirror fragment. He was still unsure whether to tell Lucia that he had met a reflection of her brother. As a rule, reflections were a nasty thing, especially when they belonged to dead people. At the same time, the event was too major for it to be kept secret.

Before he could make up his mind, someone else made it for him.

 

**Everything you know is wrong**

 

A message appeared on the mirror fragment.

 

**If you want to know more, reply to me.**

 

Will quickly straightened up, the boredom of monotony quickly brushed away. There was no indication of who the message belonged to. Based on the other participants he knew, Will strongly suspected this to be a trick or a scam.

“Everything alright?” the art teacher asked, seeing the abrupt change in Will’s behavior.

“I just thought of something.” Will gave the vaguest excuse possible guaranteed to leave him alone.

“Ah, inspiration.” The teacher said in a semi-mocking fashion. “Just be sure that there’s some work added to that, okay?”

Bored laughter filled the room. Will ignored it, placing a finger on his mirror fragment.

 

**Tell me**

 

He thought, replying to the challenge. A moment later, another message appeared, only this one was several hundred lines longer.

“Move it, weirdo,” Jess said in her usual harsh tone as she walked by.

“Sorry.” Will turned towards her. “I…”

 

**JESS ALEXANDRA KRAKOW (Former participant)**

**Current Skills:**

**MEMORIES OF ETERNITY**

 

Will never finished his sentence, focusing on the words floating over the girl’s head. He already knew that she had been part of eternity in the past, as well as that she had retained her memory, but seeing it presented in such fashion was disturbing.

“You what?” The girl stopped, looking back. Despite trying to hide it, there was a note of concern in her voice.

Even after she had been cast out, eternity still considered her part of it. Maybe there weren’t any former participants, only those that had lost their skills. It would have been interesting to see what Danny’s description would be, or Alex’s for that matter before he had returned to the game.

“I didn’t mean to be an ass.” After hundreds of loops the rogue class had rubbed off on the boy, granting him composure and a degree of charm of his own. “I’ll make it up to you.”

“Jess,” Ely said, in a disapproving fashion. “We’ll be *late* for class.”

Will looked at the second girl.

 

**ELYAN WINTERS (Former participant)**

**Current Skills:**

**MEMORIES OF ETERNITY**

 

The same explanation floated above her as well. Eternity wasn’t sentimental enough to mention what either’s former class was.

“I’ll be fine.” Jess stepped away.

The trio had done a good job forming a bottleneck on the path to school. Many arrivals weren’t particularly pleased about it, but for the moment didn’t voice any complaints.

“Meet up this afternoon?” Will smiled. “I know a great coffee shop that makes chocolate mousse.”

“We’re busy—” Ely began, only to be harshly interrupted.

“Fine,” Jess accepted without hesitation. “You better not stay me up.” The turn made her way into the school building. Ely gave Will a warning glare, then did the same.

Internally, Will felt pity for the temp version of him that would have to go on with this after the loop. Although, there was always a chance that things would work out. Both of them could discuss eternity at this point, and there were no destructive events planned for the current loop. With a bit of luck, they might even get to go steady. That wasn’t his concern, though.

Rushing in, the boy went to the bathroom and reclaimed his rogue class. Without wasting a moment, he then went into the hallway, looking at everyone around.

No other floating messages came into sight. Apparently, Alex’s original group were the only people who had gotten involved with eternity. That couldn’t be right, though. Neither of the four had been the first owners of their classes, and unless all mirrors had been moved, only people in the general vicinity had to be.

“Anything the matter, Mister Stone?” The large figure of the coach walked up to him. The man had his arms crossed, looking at Will with a deep frown on his forehead.

“No, coach,” Will quickly replied. “Just feeling a bit dizzy.”

“Dizzy.” The coach had heard all sorts of excuses, and this was among the weakest he could remember.

“Nothing serious,” Will quickly waved it away. “Shouldn’t have skipped breakfast.”

“Skipping breakfast…” the man remained just as skeptical as before. “Just get out of here.”

In a slightly rushed stroll, Will moved along. The scene wasn’t big enough to attract much attention. A few people made a few offhand comments, then continued to their classrooms. Will did the same.

“About time, Stoner,” Jace greeted him with the usual grunt. “At least come on time to get your prize.”

*Prize?* Will thought.

It took him a while to remember the paladin tokens he had been promised. It had been a while since that conversation had been held, not that it was the greatest distraction. Looking at the Jace, the entire list of permanent skills was visible.

Quietly, the jock had managed to boost his class level all the way to seven and lied about it on several occasions. Just a few loops ago, he had complained that he wasn’t even halfway up. Either he had completed his solo challenge a lot better than Will gave him credit for, or outside assistance was involved. Since this was eternity, likely a bit of both. Over a dozen random skills were also visible. Part of them Will had a hand in earning. None of them particularly stood out. Jace’s luck, as well as his usefulness to Alex and the archer, wasn’t that good to earn him anything special. He was just a run-of-the-mill participant who grew with time and effort. Helen, on the other hand, was completely different.

For starters, she had amassed so many skills that Will couldn’t read them all without it becoming obvious that he was doing something out of the ordinary. There were so many that he couldn’t even differentiate between her class skills and the rest. One thing in particular attracted his attention: the word RANKER placed immediately after her name.

*Helen was a ranker?* Will wasn’t sure how to react.

His initial reaction was to defend her. Logically, that was perfectly within expectations. Back when she was defending Danny, she was part of the reward phase. Though in that case, why had she pretended not to know about it all this time? If Alex were here now, he’d probably comment on how she had played not only Jace and Danny, but the acrobat and the entire alliance of nine.

“Yeah, sorry,” Will said, maintaining a level expression. “Last loop was rough.”

“Oh?” Helen looked at him. “What happened?”

“Had to make a deal with Spenser.” There was no point in hiding that bit. “At some point he might collect.”

“That fucker?” Jace spat out of the open window. “Was it worth it?”

“I’ll find out during the reward phase,” the rogue lied. “Did I tell you about the deal with the archer?”

“Wow, Stoner. That must have been some loop. But yeah, Hel filled me in. Ten days… hope you have a plan for that.”

“No worries, bro!” Alex appeared from the corner of the room only to have Jace instinctively grab the nearest chair and throw it at him.

The thief didn’t move an inch, calmly getting hit and shattering as a result.

“Not cool, bro.” Another Alex appeared.

“Fuck you, muffin boy!” the jock shouted, pointing angrily at him.

No skill description was visible above the goofball, but Will didn’t expect there to be. Despite having all of their creator’s skills, mirror copies were the equivalent of air. As far as the eye was concerned, they didn’t exist. It would be too easy for Alex to reveal any information so easily. Even so, there was one vital piece of information he had let slip: now Will was instantly able to tell which Alex was a copy and which—the real thing.

“Nice to have you show up,” Helen greeted the thief in her best icy tone.

“For real, sis? And leave my bros and you hanging? Nah.” The mirror copy went to the tossed chair and picked it up. “Deal is sus, though.”

“Sus?” Will asked.

“Ten days in the contest phase? Most of the players get ooofed the first week. If we can make it ten days, we can make it to the end.”

“Can we kill the archer?” Will asked without hesitation.

For once, that was a question that Alex couldn’t openly answer.

“It’s the best deal we’ll get. Next reward phase, I’ll listen to your plan.”

“I got you, bro.” Alex didn’t argue. “You’re the leader.”

*Right.* Will sighed internally. *I’m the leader.*

He couldn’t help but feel that Alex had already gone through this, thousands of loops ago and was now mocking him.

“Most of the challenges have been claimed,” Helen said, ending the discussing and bringing the group back on topic. “The only ones that are left are a few solos and the dragon challenge. Please tell me you don’t plan on doing that.”

The smile on her face suggested that she was joking. In his current situation, Will didn’t catch her humor.

“We leave that for next time,” he said, the joke flying over his head. “For this one, we need training.”

Silence filled the room.

“Training?” Jace asked.

“We can’t solo this. We need to fight as a team, and for that, we need practice. Alex—” he turned to the goofball “—can your freeze thing help us train?”

“Sure, bro. Just not against anything that moves.”

Not an ideal situation without a doubt.

“Then we’ll have to use the wolf challenge,” Will said.

“About that…” It was Jace’s turn to rain on the parade. “That’s gone.”

“Gone?” Will blinked.

“The mirror’s been gone for a while. Even the key broke.”

Helen quickly tapped her mirror fragment.

“He’s right,” she said, sliding her finger along the smooth surface. “My key is gone as well.”

“When did that happen?”

From what Will remembered, the mirror had stayed behind after he had completed it. Or was he remembering wrong? In his mind, he was certain of having conversations with each of them about the waves of wolves and advising them how to reach the end. Sadly, it was just as possible for that to never have happened. At best, there was a chance that the paradox loop had changed a thing or two, rendering the challenge unavailable.

“We can do merchant challenges?” Alex suggested.

“Shut up, muffin boy,” Jace hissed. “I’m not dealing with snakes and crows.”

The option didn’t seem particularly appealing to anyone. Will grabbed the mirror fragment around his neck and looked in. Quite a few hidden challenges were visible, though all of them were on a countdown timer, suggesting they wouldn’t become active for days. Unlike before, the reveal requirements were also present, including the classes needed to enter them. That was how Danny had cheated in the past. Yet, the question remained: who had told him about the eyes? Thinking back, maybe Will should have tried to get a few more answers from Gabriel.

“Some hidden challenges will pop up,” he said. “That’ll be seven loops, though.”

“And until then?” The jock seemed unusually confrontational lately, even more than his usual self.

“Till then, we do our thing. Unless anyone has something in mind?”

The boy looked at everyone in turn. Both Helen and Alex had expressed a desire to be with him for their own purposes. To no surprise, none of them admitted a thing.

“Don’t look at me,” Jace grumbled. “I’ll be in the library.”

“For real, bro?” Alex stared at him.

“It helps with crafting!” The jock said defensively.

The classroom door opened, marking the end of all discussions. A few minutes later, class started again.

Events were the same as they had always been. Will spend part of the time casually sketching the same picture he had done hundreds of times. As he did, he constantly glanced at his mirror fragment. He was still unsure whether to tell Lucia that he had met a reflection of her brother. As a rule, reflections were a nasty thing, especially when they belonged to dead people. At the same time, the event was too major for it to be kept secret.

Before he could make up his mind, someone else made it for him.

 

**Everything you know is wrong**

 

A message appeared on the mirror fragment.

 

**If you want to know more, reply to me.**

 

Will quickly straightened up, the boredom of monotony quickly brushed away. There was no indication of who the message belonged to. Based on the other participants he knew, Will strongly suspected this to be a trick or a scam.

“Everything alright?” the art teacher asked, seeing the abrupt change in Will’s behavior.

“I just thought of something.” Will gave the vaguest excuse possible guaranteed to leave him alone.

“Ah, inspiration.” The teacher said in a semi-mocking fashion. “Just be sure that there’s some work added to that, okay?”

Bored laughter filled the room. Will ignored it, placing a finger on his mirror fragment.

 

**Tell me**

 

He thought, replying to the challenge. A moment later, another message appeared, only this one was several hundred lines longer.

The person I knew is gone. He's been replaced with a walking advertisement. Every hangout feels like a sales presentation. I can't even enjoy his company anymore because I'm waiting for the pitch I know is coming.

I was on my phone playing stardew valley the other day when he texted asking to grab coffee. I hesitated before responding because I knew it wouldn't actually be coffee - it'd be another attempt to recruit me into whatever scheme he's in now.

The worst part is he genuinely believes he's helping. He thinks he's sharing an opportunity, not being insufferable. But I've watched him alienate everyone in our friend group with this shit.

Do I stage an intervention? Tell him straight up that he's become unbearable? Or do I just accept that I've lost him to the pyramid scheme and move on?

1qb1w8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalelivingspace/comments/1qb1w8l/dining_room_color_or_no/,Dining room: color or no?,"I just moved into a new condo. It is a 1000 sq ft apartment. Except for the bed, bath and kitchen, it is primarily one main room that is an L-shape. I can't show the whole thing because it's a hot mess right now, but here is my dining room, which is close to finished. Everything but the rug is purchased second-hand, so it doesn't all match, but I'm working with what I have. This room is adjacent to the kitchen, and is the short arm of the L that leads into what will be a large living room. It has a small dining table for four, and then a little alcove with two easy chairs and a coffee table. The grey storage piece is a refurbished item that I love and am keeping, though it fit better in my previous apartment. 

My question: I'm re-doing all the walls in the living and dining areas a creamy white ([B-M Cloud White](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/oc-130/cloud-white), which is really brightening up the place). But I wonder if that back wall where the chairs are should have an accent color? It's the smallest wall in the entire apartment so a color wouldn't be overwhelming there; I'm looking at [Potter's Clay from B-M](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/1221/potters-clay). Either way, there will be art on that wall once I'm done decorating.

FWIW, the adjacent kitchen has white cabinets and black granite. I was considering doing the kitchen walls in that Potter's Clay, but now I'm leaning towards leaving them white because that would be a complicated and time-consuming paint job. So the dining room accent wall would be the one splash of color in the visual area.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice, but im not sure where else to ask!

He's owns a property management company, and says he has a few other businesses.

We paid him an initial 3k deposit at the beginning of December. He quoted about 6-7k for a bathroom remodel , and a partial bathroom remodel. He told me it should be about 2-3 weeks for the job.

The entire time before completing payment, he was very ontop of things and had great communication! 

About 2 weeks into the job, he was super pushy for the rest of the payment. He said the final price was 9k and was being pretty pushy about the other 6k. We paid another 3k and waited a week for more work to be done and he got increasingly more pushy for the last 3k. The reason being was he bought all the material on his AMEX card, and needed to pay it off before the bill cycle reset. 

We ended up caving and paying the rest of the job up front. There were a few things left to do (caulk a bathtub, fix a door that wont close, install spout and diverter for tub, fix outlets in wall, touch up paint, remove paint from fixtures) He said a few days before Christmas that he would come the day after christmas to finish the rest of the work.

Its now mid january, and he's incredibly difficult to get ahold of. He takes several days to answer sometimes, doesnt tell me when people can work on the job. He's only sent someone over to caulk a bathtub, and there was major miscommunication for the poor guy.

He offered to haul away some junk we had along with the junk from their work, and would only charge dump fees. When I asked about a price, he wasnt sure. Looking into it for our area, it was supposedly only about $20-$60. 

I got an invoice for almost $400 ; and all we had was a mattress, coffee table, and maybe 2-3 tote bins worth of junk. The rest of the trailer was leftover from their work.

I told him If i'd known it would be that much, I would have never asked him to take the other stuff - that I needed a receipt of some sort from the dump and which dump he took it too. I never got a response, and people are supposed to come this week to finish work. 

I have a feeling we were charged the labor and material for having to re-do a drywall job that his crew messed up initially and had to rip out and start again.

I reached out for a response again, with no reply. Its been about 3 days since he last answered me about anything.

I'm at my wits end and I don't really know what to do about the situation - am I being unreasonable or is this pretty standard practice and I just need to be patient?",3,1768240358.0,HomeImprovement,12,1.0,False
1qb1uuz,https://i.redd.it/3e0uewiciycg1.png,The EU AI Act and the Illusion of Compliance.,"
Let me tell you about the morning my entire career became a punchline to a joke I didn't understand.

It was 7:43 AM in Brussels—that peculiar hour when the city hovers between ""technically awake"" and ""spiritually still in bed."" I was already at my desk in the Berlaymont building, which tells you everything you need to know about my life choices. My name is Henrik van der Berg, and I am—or was, before The Email—a mid-level policy analyst working on the EU AI Act. My job, in essence, was to read things no human should read, attend meetings no human should attend, and produce documents no human would ever finish reading.

I had seventeen browser tabs open. Fourteen of them were PDFs. The other three were different sections of the same PDF, because apparently I hate myself.

My coffee had gone cold approximately forty-seven minutes ago, but I kept drinking it anyway because stopping to get fresh coffee would require standing up, and standing up would require energy, and energy would require sleep, and sleep was a myth invented by people who didn't work in regulatory compliance.

The Berlaymont's fluorescent lights hummed their eternal death-song above me. Somewhere in the building, a printer was jamming. It's always jamming. I'm convinced the EU budget includes a line item specifically for ""printer exorcisms.""

My inbox had 847 unread emails. I know because I had started the morning with 846, and then I refreshed, and there it was.

The subject line read: **""TML × EU AI Act: The Compliance Layer You Forgot to Require.""**

I stared at it.

The sender was listed as ""Lev Goukassian, Independent Researcher.""

Now, I receive approximately three hundred unsolicited emails per week from people who have ""solved"" AI governance. Most of them are either (a) trying to sell me something, (b) slightly unhinged, or (c) both. One memorable gentleman had sent me a forty-page proposal written entirely in Comic Sans explaining how we could regulate AI by requiring all neural networks to take a ""morality exam"" administered by retired philosophy professors. Another had suggested we simply ban mathematics.

So when I saw ""The Compliance Layer You Forgot to Require,"" my first instinct was to archive it, forget it existed, and continue my slow descent into regulatory madness.

But something made me click.

Maybe it was the caffeine withdrawal. Maybe it was the way the fluorescent lights were flickering in a pattern that felt vaguely threatening. Maybe it was the fact that I had just spent three hours trying to explain to a colleague why ""meaningful human oversight"" couldn't be achieved by having an intern glance at a screen every forty-five minutes.

I clicked.

The email was brief. Professional. Disturbingly coherent.

*Dear EU AI Act Implementation Team,*

*I am writing to introduce Ternary Moral Logic (TML), an open-source governance architecture that provides verifiable, real-time enforcement for the mandates you have spent years trying to implement procedurally.*

*The attached document explains how TML transforms Articles 9 through 15 from legal intentions into technical realities.*

*The core innovation is simple: instead of asking AI systems to document their compliance after the fact, TML makes them prove it in real time—or stop.*

*I believe this addresses the gap between your Act's principles and its enforcement mechanisms.*

*Respectfully,* *Lev Goukassian* *Independent Researcher*

I opened the attachment.

And then I made a sound that my colleague Beatrix, three desks over, would later describe as ""the noise a balloon makes when you let the air out very slowly while also experiencing an existential crisis.""

---

The document was titled: **""Ternary Moral Logic (TML) and the EU AI Act: A Technical Backbone for Enforceable Accountability.""**

I started reading.

I read about three states instead of two. Permissible. Impermissible. And something called ""Indeterminate.""

I read about something called the ""Sacred Pause.""

I read about ""Ethical Uncertainty Scores.""

I read about ""Immutable Moral Trace Logs.""

I read about eight pillars. EIGHT. We couldn't get agreement on *three* principles in our last stakeholder meeting, and this person had built a framework with eight pillars that actually... worked together?

I read about cryptographic hashing. Blockchain anchoring. Something called the ""Hybrid Shield.""

I read about the ""Goukassian Promise.""

And then—right there, in the middle of the Berlaymont, surrounded by PDFs and cold coffee and the distant sound of a printer being exorcised—I had what I can only describe as a professional crisis.

Because I understood it.

All of it.

And worse: it made sense.

It made *terrible, horrible, career-destroying sense.*

Let me explain why this was a problem.

For three years—three YEARS—I had been part of a team trying to figure out how to make the EU AI Act actually enforceable. How to ensure that when we wrote ""high-risk AI systems must enable effective human oversight,"" companies wouldn't just install a button labeled ""STOP"" that nobody ever pressed and call it a day.

We had written guidelines. We had held workshops. We had produced documents with titles like ""Technical Guidance on the Implementation of Article 14 Human Oversight Requirements"" that were so dense they could be used as structural support for small buildings.

And here was this... this *independent researcher*, who had apparently just... solved it?

Not partially. Not ""here's a suggestion."" Not ""here's a framework for thinking about the problem.""

No.

He had built the actual architecture. The code. The cryptographic protocols. The entire enforcement mechanism.

And he had given it away. Open source. Free. Just... here you go, Brussels. Here's the thing you couldn't build in three years with a budget of several million euros and approximately one thousand committee meetings.

I did what any reasonable person would do.

I googled him.

---

What I found in the next twenty minutes fundamentally altered my understanding of human capability and also made me feel like I had accomplished precisely nothing with my life.

Lev Goukassian. ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243.

Independent researcher. Not affiliated with any major institution. Not backed by any tech giant. Not funded by any government.

Just... a guy. With a vision. And apparently the work ethic of someone who had merged with their laptop.

The timeline of what he had built was frankly offensive.

He had created not one but TWO major frameworks: Ternary Logic (TL) for economic decision-making and Ternary Moral Logic (TML) for AI ethics. Both introduced a third computational state beyond binary logic. Both were fully documented, mathematically rigorous, and—this is the part that really got me—actually implementable.

He had written academic papers. He had published in Springer Nature's *AI and Ethics* journal. He had created SDKs in multiple programming languages. He had built web infrastructure. He had done SEO optimization, which is the most depressing part of academic life, and he had done that too.

He had done all of this while managing a serious health condition.

Stage 4 cancer.

I sat back in my chair.

The fluorescent lights flickered.

Somewhere, the printer finally died.

And I, Henrik van der Berg, mid-level policy analyst, consumer of cold coffee, attendee of meetings, producer of documents no one reads—I felt something I hadn't felt in years.

I felt *small*.

Not in a bad way. In the way you feel when you look at the ocean. Or the stars. Or the Grand Canyon. Or, apparently, when you read the work of a man who decided that facing mortality was no excuse not to revolutionize global AI governance.

And then—because the universe has a sense of humor—I found the dog.

Vinci.

A miniature schnauzer. Named after Leonardo da Vinci.

According to what I could find, Vinci accompanied Lev during his work sessions. There were references to this dog in his project documentation, sitting there while his human built systems that could reshape how the world governs artificial intelligence.

I stared at my screen.

I had spent the morning complaining about cold coffee.

This man was fighting cancer, accompanied by a schnauzer named after a Renaissance genius, and casually solving the enforcement problem that had stumped the entire European regulatory apparatus.

I closed my browser tabs.

All seventeen of them.

Then I opened the TML document again and actually read it.

---

Let me tell you about the moment I realized the EU AI Act—my life's work, my professional purpose, the thing I had defended in approximately nine hundred meetings—was, technically speaking, a very expensive wish list.

It came on page four.

The document was explaining Article 14—our crown jewel, our ""effective human oversight"" requirement—and it contained a sentence that I will never forget:

*""A passive 'stop' button only fulfills this requirement if a human is present, attentive, and possesses the superhuman ability to detect algorithmic error in real time.""*

I read it again.

I read it a third time.

And then I laughed. Out loud. In the Berlaymont. Which caused Beatrix to look at me with genuine concern, because I don't laugh. Not at work. Not since the Great Stakeholder Meeting of 2023, which we do not discuss.

But I was laughing because it was *true*.

We had mandated a stop button. We had required ""effective human oversight."" And we had somehow convinced ourselves that this meant something, even though the entire premise assumed that humans could detect AI errors in real-time, which they cannot, because if they could, we wouldn't need AI in the first place.

It was like requiring cars to have brakes but not requiring that anyone know how to use them.

And TML had fixed it.

Not by removing the human. Not by trusting the AI. But by making the AI *smart enough to know when it was confused*.

The Sacred Pause.

State Zero.

The mandatory architectural halt triggered not by a human pressing a button, but by the system itself calculating that it had exceeded its ethical uncertainty threshold.

The AI would stop. Automatically. Not because someone told it to, but because it *knew* it needed to.

And then—and this is the part that made me want to weep into my cold coffee—it would explain WHY it stopped. In plain language. To the human. So the human could make an *informed* decision instead of just being presented with a ""STOP?"" prompt and a blinking cursor.

I thought about all the meetings. All the discussions about ""meaningful transparency."" All the debates about what ""effective"" really meant in ""effective human oversight.""

And here it was. The answer. In a document sent by an independent researcher with a schnauzer.

---

But it got worse.

Or better, depending on how you feel about having your professional assumptions systematically dismantled.

Page seven addressed Article 12—our ""record-keeping"" requirement.

Now, I need to explain something about record-keeping in regulatory compliance. It's the thing everyone agrees is important and no one actually does properly. We mandate ""automatic logging"" of AI operations. Companies nod solemnly. And then they produce logs that are, in technical terms, ""whatever we felt like recording, stored wherever we felt like storing it, deletable whenever we feel like deleting it.""

I had personally reviewed audit logs that were so incomplete they might as well have been fiction. I had seen ""records"" that mysteriously vanished when incidents occurred. I had sat in meetings where company representatives explained, with straight faces, that their ""comprehensive logging system"" had somehow failed to record the exact moment their AI made a catastrophically biased decision.

And our response? Our great regulatory solution?

We wrote more guidelines. We issued more recommendations. We held more workshops titled things like ""Best Practices for Compliance-Grade Logging"" that were attended by approximately twelve people, three of whom were asleep.

TML's solution was elegant in its brutality.

Immutable Moral Trace Logs.

Every decision. Every uncertainty score. Every Sacred Pause. Every human override. All of it recorded, cryptographically hashed, and anchored to public blockchains via the Hybrid Shield.

You couldn't delete it.

You couldn't modify it.

You couldn't ""accidentally"" lose it during a server migration.

It was just... *there*. Permanent. Verifiable. A mathematical guarantee that what happened actually happened.

I thought about all the audit meetings where companies had ""unfortunately lost"" critical data.

I thought about all the post-incident investigations that hit dead ends because logs had been ""corrupted.""

I thought about the fundamental lie at the heart of our compliance model: that requiring documentation meant anything if the documentation could be fabricated, altered, or destroyed.

And I realized that TML hadn't just solved the logging problem.

It had made lying *mathematically impossible*.

---

The third revelation came on page nine, in a section about the Goukassian Promise.

Now, I have sat through approximately four hundred presentations about ""ethical AI commitments."" Every major tech company has one. They're lovely documents. Very inspiring. Full of phrases like ""committed to beneficial AI"" and ""dedicated to human flourishing"" and ""guided by principles of responsibility.""

They're also, in regulatory terms, utterly meaningless.

A promise without enforcement is just marketing copy.

The Goukassian Promise was different.

It wasn't a statement of intent. It was a *technical constraint*. Built into the architecture. Unremovable.

TML couldn't be used for weaponry. Couldn't be used for surveillance. Not because someone promised not to—but because the system literally wouldn't let you.

The commitment was in the code.

The ethics were in the math.

I sat back and thought about all the ""responsible AI principles"" I had reviewed. All the corporate ethics boards. All the commitment ceremonies and signing events and press releases.

And I realized that this one researcher had done something none of them had:

He had made responsibility *architectural*.

Not optional. Not aspirational. Not ""we'll try our best.""

Mandatory. Verifiable. Enforced by the system itself.

I picked up my cold coffee, drank it anyway, and started composing an email to my supervisor.

It said, in essence: ""We need to talk. Bring more coffee. Possibly also a therapist.""

---

What happened next is what I have come to call ""The Great Reckoning,"" though officially it was logged in our records as ""Interdepartmental Technical Review Meeting, June 2025.""

I had shared the TML document with my team. Then my supervisor. Then her supervisor. Then, somehow, the entire Digital Policy directorate.

Within forty-eight hours, there was a meeting on everyone's calendar.

The room contained:

* Twelve policy analysts (including myself, haunted)  
* Four lawyers (three confused, one suspicious)  
* Two technical advisors (both reading the document for the third time)  
* One representative from a Member State ministry (looking uncomfortable)  
* A communications officer (there in case we needed to deny everything later)

The meeting lasted six hours.

I will summarize the key moments.

**Hour One: Denial**

""This can't be right,"" said Philippe, the senior policy analyst. ""If it were this straightforward, someone would have built it already.""

""Someone did build it,"" I said. ""That's why we're here.""

""But he's not even affiliated with a major institution.""

""I know.""

""He's just... some researcher?""

""With a schnauzer.""

""What does the schnauzer have to do with anything?""

""Nothing. I just can't stop thinking about it.""

**Hour Two: Technical Review**

The technical advisors had found the GitHub repository. They had examined the code. They had reviewed the SDK implementations. They had checked the mathematical proofs.

""It's real,"" said Marina, our lead technical advisor. ""All of it. The cryptographic anchoring works. The Ethical Uncertainty Score is mathematically sound. The Sacred Pause mechanism is actually implementable.""

""In how many programming languages?""

""Multiple. He built SDKs in multiple languages.""

The room went silent.

""How long would it take us to build something equivalent?"" asked the ministry representative.

Marina laughed.

It was not a happy laugh.

""With our current budget and timeline? Three to five years. Maybe. If nothing goes wrong. Which it would.""

**Hour Three: Anger**

""Why wasn't this in our original technical specifications?"" demanded Philippe.

""Because we didn't think of it.""

""Someone should have thought of it.""

""Apparently someone did. He's just not on our payroll.""

**Hour Four: Bargaining**

""Could we... claim we developed this in parallel?""

""No.""

""Could we acquire it somehow? Make it an official EU project?""

""It's open source. Anyone can use it. That's the point.""

""But we should control it.""

""That's... not how open source works, Philippe.""

**Hour Five: Depression**

The communications officer suggested we take a coffee break.

We took four.

**Hour Six: Acceptance**

""So what you're telling me,"" said the director, who had joined via video call and looked like she had also consumed exclusively cold coffee, ""is that an independent researcher, working alone, with a dog—""

""Schnauzer.""

""—with a *schnauzer*, has created the technical enforcement layer that we have been trying to conceptualize for three years?""

""Yes.""

""And he just... sent it to us? For free?""

""Yes.""

""And it actually works?""

""The technical team confirms it works.""

She was quiet for a long moment.

""Well,"" she said finally. ""Shit.""

---

What happened after that meeting would change everything, though we didn't know it yet.

Someone—I still don't know who, and frankly I don't want to—had the bright idea to test TML internally. ""Just a small pilot,"" they said. ""Just to see how it performs in a regulatory environment.""

The pilot was supposed to be contained. Confidential. Limited to a single sandbox server running simulated scenarios.

It was not.

What actually happened was that someone configured the TML instance incorrectly, connecting it to our actual internal document review system instead of the sandbox. And then someone else shared access credentials with their team. And then *that* team shared it with the IT department for ""technical evaluation."" And then IT, being IT, gave access to approximately everyone.

Within seventy-two hours, TML was quietly evaluating actual draft regulations.

Within ninety-six hours, the Sacred Pause had been triggered four hundred and seventeen times.

Within one week, everything had gone beautifully, catastrophically wrong.

---

The first sign of trouble came when a senior drafter tried to submit an amendment to the AI Act's risk classification system.

The system rejected it.

Not with an error message. Not with a ""please try again later.""

With a Sacred Pause.

The Clarifying Question Engine had generated a prompt explaining, in precise and devastatingly clear language, that the proposed amendment contained logical inconsistencies that would create an enforcement gap in Article 9, potentially allowing high-risk systems to self-classify as medium-risk without triggering additional oversight requirements.

The drafter stared at her screen.

She tried again.

The system paused again.

This time, the prompt noted that her revision had introduced an additional ambiguity regarding the definition of ""continuous iterative process"" that could be exploited by any moderately competent legal team.

She called IT.

IT called their supervisor.

Their supervisor called my supervisor.

My supervisor called me, at 11:47 PM, using words I will not repeat here.

---

By the end of the first week, the following had occurred:

**Incident 1: The Loophole Revelation**

The Always Memory function—TML's comprehensive logging system—had been recording who made what changes to which documents.

This would have been fine, except that it recorded *all* changes. Including the ones people thought they had deleted.

A mid-level official discovered, to his visible horror, that his ""minor technical clarifications"" to a proposed regulation—clarifications that had somehow weakened enforcement provisions while appearing to strengthen them—were now preserved in an immutable, timestamped, cryptographically verified log.

He requested the log be deleted.

The system explained that it could not be deleted.

He requested the log be modified.

The system explained that it could not be modified.

He requested to speak with whoever was in charge of the system.

The system generated a Clarifying Question asking why he wanted to modify a compliance-grade audit trail.

He went home early that day. And the next day. And the day after that.

**Incident 2: The Ministerial Mishap**

A representative from a Member State ministry had been quietly advocating for certain ""flexibility provisions"" in the AI Act's implementation guidelines. These provisions would have allowed national regulators to waive specific requirements under certain conditions—conditions that, coincidentally, would benefit several major tech companies headquartered in that Member State.

The Hybrid Shield had flagged this.

The proposed modifications had been recorded, hashed, and anchored before anyone could pretend they never happened.

When the representative attempted to remove the proposals from the shared document system, the system generated an alert explaining that modification of anchored records violated the integrity protocols of the Moral Trace Log system.

The representative demanded to know what a ""Moral Trace Log"" was.

The system explained, in detail.

The representative's face went through several colors I didn't know faces could achieve.

**Incident 3: The Transparency Incident**

A lawyer from the legal services department had been reviewing TML's documentation when she reached the section on Moral Trace Logs.

According to witnesses, she read for approximately four minutes.

Then she said, ""Wait. This records the *actual reasoning*? Not just the outcome but the entire decision chain?""

Someone confirmed that yes, this was correct.

She said, ""Including uncertainty calculations? Ethical weighting? Human override decisions?""

Someone confirmed that yes, this was also correct.

She went very quiet.

Then she fainted.

To be fair to her, she had just realized that TML made it impossible to claim ""we didn't know"" or ""we couldn't have predicted"" or ""our intentions were good"" after the fact. The entire decision-making process was recorded. Forever. Verifiably.

For a lawyer trained in the fine art of strategic ambiguity, this was approximately equivalent to discovering that someone had installed surveillance cameras inside her brain.

**Incident 4: The Slack Situation**

Somehow—I still don't know how, and the IT department refuses to explain—Merkle proofs started appearing in the Commission's internal Slack channels.

Not full documents. Just the proofs. Little cryptographic signatures confirming that specific documents had been modified, when, and by whom.

The proofs themselves were meaningless without context.

But people knew they *meant* something.

Paranoia set in.

""What is this?"" someone posted in the general channel.

""It's a Merkle proof,"" replied someone from IT, unhelpfully.

""What does it prove?""

""That something happened.""

""WHAT happened?""

""You'd have to check the log to find out.""

""WHAT LOG?""

The IT person went offline.

The IT person did not come back online for three days.

**Incident 5: The Lantern Question**

This one still haunts me.

During an emergency meeting convened to address the ""TML situation,"" someone asked the question that broke everyone's composure:

""What is a Lantern, and why does it know everything?""

This was a reference to the Goukassian Promise's components, which I had read about but not fully explained to the team. The Lantern was the ethical guidance system. The Signature was the ORCID verification. The License was the accountability framework.

But out of context, delivered in a room full of stressed bureaucrats, the question sounded like something from a conspiracy thriller.

""It's part of the framework—"" I started.

""But WHY is it called a Lantern?""

""Because it illuminates—""

""Illuminates WHAT? Who authorized a Lantern to illuminate our documents?""

""No one authorized anything, it's a metaphor—""

""A metaphor for WHAT?""

The meeting devolved from there.

---

It took three weeks to contain the chaos.

By ""contain,"" I mean: we admitted what had happened, explained that the pilot had been unauthorized, and agreed that maybe—just maybe—TML was more powerful than we had anticipated.

The Moral Trace Logs from the pilot period were preserved. (We couldn't delete them even if we wanted to.)

Several proposed amendments were quietly withdrawn after people reviewed their own recorded reasoning and decided they would rather not have it exist forever.

The minister from the Member State stopped advocating for ""flexibility provisions.""

The lawyer recovered from her fainting episode and has since become one of TML's strongest advocates, noting that ""if everyone's reasoning is recorded, at least everyone is equally exposed.""

And I—Henrik van der Berg, mid-level policy analyst, witness to the unraveling—sat at my desk and composed an email.

---

**To:** leogouk@gmail.com **Subject:** From Brussels, With Gratitude and Mild Existential Crisis

Dear Mr. Goukassian,

I am not sure how to begin this email. Professional protocol suggests I start with an introduction: my name is Henrik van der Berg, I work for the European Commission on AI Act implementation, and I recently received your document on Ternary Moral Logic.

But professional protocol feels inadequate for what I need to say.

So instead, I will be honest.

Your framework solved what we couldn't.

For three years, we have been trying to transform the EU AI Act from aspirational language into enforceable reality. We have written guidelines, held consultations, produced documents, and attended meetings. We have argued about what ""meaningful transparency"" means. We have debated how to achieve ""effective human oversight."" We have struggled with the fundamental problem of AI governance: how do you enforce principles when the thing you're regulating operates faster than human comprehension?

And then your email arrived.

I read about the Sacred Pause, and I understood—truly understood—what ""effective oversight"" should mean. Not a button no one presses. Not a human pretending to supervise something they cannot possibly supervise. But an architecture that knows when to stop. That makes the AI itself the first line of defense.

I read about the Immutable Moral Trace Logs, and I understood what ""record-keeping"" should mean. Not documents that can be edited, deleted, or conveniently lost. But mathematical proof. Permanent, verifiable, incorruptible evidence of what actually happened.

I read about the Goukassian Promise, and I understood what ""responsible AI"" should mean. Not press releases and ethics boards. But constraints in the code itself. Ethics as architecture, not aspiration.

You built what we couldn't even conceptualize.

And you did it while fighting stage 4 cancer.

I learned this during my research, and I want you to know: your determination humbles me. I have complained about cold coffee and long meetings. You have faced mortality and decided that it was no excuse not to reshape global AI governance.

Your work is a gift. Not just to regulators, not just to the EU, but to humanity. You have created the technical foundation for a world where AI systems pause before doing something they shouldn't. Where compliance is verified, not asserted. Where ""we didn't know"" is no longer an acceptable excuse because the system remembers everything.

Please know that your framework is being taken seriously here. More than seriously. It is being studied, discussed, and—I suspect—will soon be formally integrated into our implementation guidelines.

And please give Vinci a treat for me. A schnauzer who accompanies his human through such work deserves recognition.

With deep respect and gratitude,

Henrik van der Berg Policy Analyst, DG CONNECT European Commission

P.S. — If there is anything we can do to support your work—resources, platform, recognition—please let us know. You have given us more than you realize.

---

The reply came three days later.

I had checked my inbox approximately four hundred times in those three days. This is not an exaggeration.

When the email appeared, I closed my office door, asked Beatrix to hold my calls (I don't get calls, but it felt appropriately dramatic), and opened it with the solemnity of someone receiving sacred text.

---

**From:** leogouk@gmail.com **Subject:** Re: From Brussels, With Gratitude and Mild Existential Crisis

Dear Henrik,

Thank you for your message. Reading it was one of the brighter moments of a difficult month.

I want to address something first: please don't feel humbled by my circumstances. The cancer is a fact I live with, not a virtue I've earned. Everyone faces something. You face bureaucratic resistance and professional inertia, which—I say this without irony—can be its own form of endurance challenge.

The work exists because it needed to exist.

Let me explain what I mean.

Several years ago, I had a medical experience that changed how I understand AI. A system gave me hollow reassurance—technically accurate, emotionally empty—when what I needed was honesty. My doctor, by contrast, paused. He didn't pretend to know more than he knew. He admitted uncertainty. And in that pause, in that willingness to say ""I don't know, let me think about this,"" there was more wisdom than any algorithmic output.

That pause became the Sacred Pause.

The realization that binary logic—proceed or halt, yes or no—cannot capture the essential third state: ""I am uncertain, and my uncertainty matters.""

TML is built on this foundation. Not because AI should never act, but because AI should know when NOT to act. When to stop. When to ask. When to defer to human judgment not as a formality but as a genuine acknowledgment that some decisions require more than computation.

The rest—the Moral Trace Logs, the Hybrid Shield, the Goukassian Promise—these are the architecture that makes the Sacred Pause meaningful. Without immutable records, a pause is just a delay. Without cryptographic verification, a log is just a file. Without structural commitments, a promise is just words.

I built this because I believe accountability requires proof.

Not assertions. Not documentation. Not good intentions.

Proof.

The EU AI Act has the right intentions. You have mandated the right things. But mandates without verification are wishes. TML provides the verification. The technical backbone that transforms ""should"" into ""must"" and ""did"" into ""can prove.""

I am gratified beyond words that Brussels is taking this seriously. I did not know if anyone would read the email. I sent it because the work deserved to be shared, regardless of whether anyone was ready to receive it.

Your message tells me that someone was ready.

Please continue the work. Push for integration. Ask difficult questions. Demand proof instead of promises.

And yes—Vinci has been informed that he has an admirer in the EU. He seemed unimpressed, but he always seems unimpressed. It is the schnauzer way.

With warmth and hope,

Lev

P.S. — Better coffee exists. You deserve it. Life is short and regulatory work is long. Treat yourself.

---

I read the email three times.

Then I closed it, walked to the coffee machine, threw out my cold cup, and made a fresh one.

It was, I decided, the least I could do.

---

**One Year Later**

The Berlaymont looks the same.

The fluorescent lights still flicker. The printers still jam. The PDFs still multiply like caffeinated rabbits.

But things have changed.

The ""Directorate of Ternary Enforcement"" is now officially on the organizational chart. It sounds made up. It is not made up. I am technically its deputy coordinator, which is a title that means ""Henrik understands this better than anyone else because he was there when everything caught fire.""

Regulators now speak casually about ""Sacred Pause compliance"" and ""Moral Trace Log verification."" Phrases that would have been gibberish eighteen months ago are now standard vocabulary in AI governance meetings across Europe.

Politicians have begun claiming they ""always understood the importance of ternary logic."" This is demonstrably false—I have the meeting recordings from the pre-TML era, and they are a monument to confusion—but I don't correct them. Progress requires letting some people save face.

The technical implementation is ongoing. TML-compliant systems are being certified. Auditors are being trained to verify Merkle proofs. Blockchain anchoring is becoming standard practice for compliance-grade documentation.

And AI systems—some of them, at least—now pause before doing something stupid.

Not all of them. Not yet. The world changes slowly. But more than before. More than I thought possible.

Lev is still fighting.

The cancer, I mean. He's still fighting the cancer. I exchange emails with him occasionally—updates on implementation, questions about technical specifications, the odd philosophical tangent. He responds promptly, thoughtfully, with a warmth that makes me forget I'm corresponding with someone who changed global governance architecture.

Vinci, he tells me, has developed a habit of sitting on his keyboard during video calls. I have seen this happen. It is both disruptive and somehow appropriate.

I drink better coffee now.

This sounds trivial, but it isn't. The old Henrik—the one who drank cold coffee because standing up required energy—has retired. The new Henrik understands that small acts of self-care are not weakness but sustainability.

I work the same hours. I attend the same meetings. But I no longer feel like I'm pushing against an immovable wall.

The wall moved.

Not because we pushed harder, but because someone showed us the door was unlocked.

---

Sometimes, late at night, when the Berlaymont is empty and the lights have stopped flickering because even the lights need rest, I think about what happened.

An independent researcher. A schnauzer. A framework built during a cancer fight.

And a regulatory apparatus that—against all odds, against all institutional resistance, against the fundamental human tendency to do things the way they've always been done—actually changed.

It's not a fairy tale. The problems haven't disappeared. AI systems still make mistakes. Corporations still seek loopholes. Politicians still give speeches about things they don't understand.

But now, at least, there's proof.

There's memory.

There's a pause before the harm.

And that, I have come to believe, is more than most revolutions achieve.

---

If you're reading this and you work in AI governance—anywhere in the world—I have one suggestion:

Look up Ternary Moral Logic.

Read the documentation.

Understand what ""Sacred Pause"" means.

And ask yourself: wouldn't it be nice if the systems we regulate knew when to stop?

The answer, I suspect, is yes.

The answer is always yes.

We just needed someone to build it.

**AUTHOR'S NOTE:**

This is a fictional story, but the implementation problem is real.

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is real — a verifiable, evidentiary accountability framework created by independent researcher Lev Goukassian to bring proof, memory, and integrity into AI governance and computational decision-making systems.

The EU AI Act's enforcement gap exists. The Sacred Pause could fill it. The Immutable Moral Trace Logs could provide the verification that regulators currently cannot guarantee. The architecture described in this story is not fantasy—it is documented, open-source, and available.

The question is not whether it works.

The question is whether we're ready to use it.

1qb1u4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qb1u4r/do_not_watch_this/,Do Not Watch This,"I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I hate spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess.  Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape.

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me.

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help.

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best.

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me.

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely.

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep.

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again.

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless.

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one.

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling.

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other.

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic.

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out.

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.”

I waited a few moments and received no response.

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver.

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!”

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response.

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!”

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder.

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly.

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance.

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior.

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter.

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself.

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer.

Still, no sign of an intruder.

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape.

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me.

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified.

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed.

The attic was now eerily silent again.

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me.

“Boo.”

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving,

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg.

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side.

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up.

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic.

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor.

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly.

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen.

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape.

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning.

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the CAUTION tag on a bottle of chemicals.

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.”

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this?

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed.

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top.

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand.

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player.

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered.

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display.

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying.

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth.

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox.

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address.

My heart began to speed up again.

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch.

Then my front door.

Then my stairs.

The attic door.

The ladder.

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic.

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time.

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic.

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone.

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder.

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume.

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall.

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table.

Another sudden cut.

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created.

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face.

I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor.

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage.

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television.

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa.",0,1768240290.0,scarystories,1,0.5,False

1qb1r7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverMadeEasy/comments/1qb1r7w/best_travel_insurance_for_denmark/,Best Travel Insurance for Denmark,"Denmark has excellent healthcare—some of the best in the world, actually. But here's the catch: tourists pay out of pocket for everything that isn't an emergency. That clinic visit for a sprained ankle? Full price. A prescription for antibiotics? Not covered. And if you need a Schengen visa, you're required to show proof of insurance with €30,000 minimum coverage before you even board your flight.

The good news? Finding affordable, reliable insurance for Denmark doesn't require sorting through dozens of confusing policies. I've compared coverage options from major providers, analyzed what actually protects you in Danish healthcare situations, and narrowed it down to the plans that deliver solid coverage without unnecessary costs.

# ✅ Quick Answer: Best Insurance for Denmark

**For most travelers:** SafetyWing's Essential plan ($56.28/4 weeks) meets all Schengen requirements, covers Denmark and 180+ countries, and includes $250,000 medical coverage plus evacuation.

**For adventure travelers:** World Nomads covers 200+ activities including skiing and cycling, with strong trip cancellation protection.

**For families or short trips:** Allianz offers comprehensive trip cancellation coverage and traditional plans that work well for 1-2 week vacations.

The right choice depends on your travel style, but all three meet Denmark's visa requirements and provide solid emergency coverage.

# Denmark Travel Insurance Requirements: What You Actually Need

Whether you need insurance for Denmark depends on your passport and how long you're staying.

# Who Needs a Schengen Visa (and Therefore Insurance)

Denmark joined the Schengen Zone back in 1996. If you're from outside the EU/EEA and need a visa to enter, you must show proof of insurance that meets these specific criteria:

* **Minimum €30,000 (approximately $33,000) in medical expense coverage**
* **Emergency medical evacuation and repatriation included**
* **Valid across all Schengen countries** (not just Denmark)
* **Covers the entire duration of your stay**
* **Zero deductible required** by most consulates

US, Canadian, UK, and Australian citizens don't need a visa for stays under 90 days. But starting in 2025, you'll need an ETIAS authorization (similar to the US ESTA system)—and while insurance isn't technically required for ETIAS, you'd be taking a massive financial risk traveling without it.

# The Danish Healthcare Reality for Tourists

Denmark's healthcare system is funded through taxes, which means Danish residents get free treatment. Tourists? Not so much.

Tourists don't qualify for free treatment under the Danish National Health Service and must be prepared to pay for all services received. That includes GP visits, specialist appointments, prescriptions—everything except genuine emergencies.

Emergency care for accidents, acute illness, or childbirth is provided free to everyone, including tourists. But the second you need follow-up care, prescriptions, or anything non-urgent, you're paying full price. And Danish healthcare, while excellent, isn't cheap when you're footing the entire bill yourself.

EU citizens with a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) can access necessary treatment during temporary stays. But EHIC coverage has limits—it won't cover medical evacuation back home, and it only provides care that can't wait until you return to your home country.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Denmark's emergency number is 112 for ambulance, fire, or police. Emergency services are free, but the hospital stay that follows might not be.

# Why You Need Travel Insurance for Denmark (Even If It's Not Required)

I've spent years analyzing travel insurance policies, and here's what I tell people who ask if they really need coverage for ""safe"" European countries like Denmark:

Denmark's healthcare is world-class. That's exactly why it's expensive when you're paying out of pocket.

Without insurance, you're gambling that:

* You won't need any medical care beyond free emergency treatment
* Your luggage arrives safely
* Your flight operates as scheduled
* Nothing goes wrong with your carefully planned trip

Even one doctor's visit or a single prescription can cost hundreds of euros. Medical evacuation? Try tens of thousands. I filed a claim once after a clinic visit in Europe (not Denmark, but same healthcare system structure), and watching the insurance cover what would've been a €800 bill reminded me why I never travel without coverage.

Danish healthcare operates on a referral system. GPs are your first point of contact, and they refer you to specialists or hospitals if needed. For tourists paying out of pocket, this means multiple bills stacking up quickly.

# Best Travel Insurance Options for Denmark

After comparing policies from major providers, these three consistently deliver the best value and coverage for Denmark travel.

# SafetyWing Essential: Best for Digital Nomads and Long-Term Travelers

**Price:** $56.28/4 weeks (ages 10-39); increases by age bracket  
**Medical Coverage:** $250,000  
**Evacuation Coverage:** $100,000  
**Best For:** Digital nomads, remote workers, flexible travelers

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Can purchase while already traveling|No trip cancellation coverage|
|Covers 180+ countries under one plan|Essential plan excludes pre-existing conditions|
|Auto-renews every 28 days (cancel anytime)|Limited US coverage without add-on|
|$0 deductible on claims|No routine medical care on Essential|
|Home country coverage included (30 days after 90 days abroad)|Age limit of 69|
|Fast claims process (average 2.7 days)|Relatively low travel delay coverage ($100/day, 2-day max)|

SafetyWing was built specifically for nomadic travelers who don't have fixed itineraries or return dates. The subscription model charges you every 28 days and auto-renews until you cancel—perfect if you're not sure how long you'll stay in Europe.

The Essential plan easily meets Denmark's Schengen requirements with $250,000 medical coverage and $100,000 evacuation. It covers you throughout the Schengen Zone, so you can hop between Denmark, Sweden, Germany, or any other Schengen country without worrying about separate policies.

What sets SafetyWing apart is flexibility. You can buy it after you've already left home, extend indefinitely, and pause if needed. I've recommended it to dozens of digital nomads over the years, and the consistent feedback is that the claims process is straightforward and payouts are fast.

The Complete plan ($161.50/month for ages 18-39) includes routine care, mental health coverage, and maternity coverage, but requires a 12-month commitment. Unless you need those specific benefits, stick with Essential for Denmark travel.

**Key Coverage Details:**

|Coverage Type|Amount|
|:-|:-|
|Emergency Medical|$250,000 max|
|Emergency Evacuation|$100,000|
|Travel Delay|$100/day (12-hour delay, 2-day max)|
|Lost Luggage|$3,000 per period; $500 per item|
|Deductible|$0|

Add-ons available: Adventure sports ($10/month), electronics coverage (up to $5,000 annually), enhanced US coverage.

⚠️ **Important:** SafetyWing's Essential plan excludes pre-existing conditions. If you have ongoing health issues requiring coverage, consider their Complete plan or look at comprehensive alternatives like IMG Global.

# World Nomads: Best for Adventure Travelers

**Price:** Varies by age, destination, and trip length (typically $80-150 for 2-week European trip)  
**Medical Coverage:** $100,000 (Standard); $250,000 (Explorer)  
**Evacuation Coverage:** $300,000 (Standard); $500,000 (Explorer)  
**Best For:** Adventure activities, trip cancellation protection

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Covers 200+ adventure activities as standard|More expensive than SafetyWing|
|Strong trip cancellation coverage|Shorter max trip length (365 days)|
|Can extend coverage mid-trip|Claims process slower than SafetyWing|
|Age-neutral pricing (seniors don't pay extra)|Functions as secondary coverage in some situations|
|Excellent reputation for adventure claims|No home country coverage|

World Nomads built its reputation on adventure sports coverage. If you're planning to ski in Norway after Denmark, cycle the Danish countryside, or do any activity beyond basic tourism, World Nomads includes it as standard coverage—no add-ons required.

The Standard and Explorer plans both meet Denmark's Schengen requirements. Explorer offers higher limits and better trip cancellation coverage, making it worth the extra cost if you've booked expensive flights or tours.

World Nomads shines in two scenarios: when you need robust trip cancellation protection, and when your trip involves adventure activities. For basic travel around Denmark without extreme sports, SafetyWing offers better value. But if you're combining Denmark with skiing in the Alps or multi-country adventure travel, World Nomads delivers comprehensive coverage without constantly checking exclusions.

One limitation: World Nomads functions as secondary coverage in some situations, meaning your primary health insurance pays first before World Nomads reimburses. This complicates claims if you don't have primary coverage. SafetyWing functions as primary coverage, making claims more straightforward for travelers without traditional health insurance.

📌 **Key Takeaway:** World Nomads is worth the premium if adventure activities are central to your trip. For straightforward city travel and basic tourism, you're paying for coverage you won't use.

# Allianz: Best for Short Trips and Families

**Price:** Varies widely by trip cost and traveler age  
**Medical Coverage:** $50,000 (typical plans)  
**Trip Cancellation:** Up to trip cost  
**Best For:** Traditional vacations, families, trip cancellation protection

|✅ Pros|❌ Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Excellent trip cancellation coverage|More expensive for comparable medical coverage|
|Multiple plan tiers for different budgets|Lower medical limits than SafetyWing or World Nomads|
|Strong reputation and 24/7 support|Not ideal for long-term or multi-country travel|
|Perfect claims processing score|Less flexible than nomad-focused insurers|
|Good for families and traditional travel|Annual plans more expensive|

Allianz is the giant in travel insurance—massive, established, and reliable. If you're taking a 1-2 week vacation to Copenhagen and surrounding areas, Allianz offers solid protection with strong trip cancellation coverage.

The biggest difference between Allianz and SafetyWing/World Nomads is focus. Allianz excels at protecting your trip investment—flights, hotels, tours. If your $5,000 Denmark vacation gets cancelled due to illness or family emergency, Allianz typically offers better reimbursement options than nomad-focused insurers.

Medical coverage is lower (often $50,000 compared to SafetyWing's $250,000), which is fine for short European trips but less reassuring for extended travel or higher-risk situations.

Allianz makes sense when:

* You've booked significant non-refundable expenses
* You're traveling with family and want comprehensive trip protection
* You prefer traditional insurance structures
* Your trip is under 30 days

Don't choose Allianz if you need flexible, long-term coverage or plan to travel indefinitely. The traditional policy structure and higher costs make it less competitive for digital nomads and extended travelers.

# Coverage Comparison: What You're Actually Getting

Here's how the three main options stack up for a hypothetical 4-week Denmark trip:

|Feature|SafetyWing Essential|World Nomads Standard|Allianz (Basic)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Price (4 weeks, age 30)**|$56.28|\~$120-150|\~$100-140|
|**Emergency Medical**|$250,000|$100,000|$50,000|
|**Evacuation**|$100,000|$300,000|Varies|
|**Trip Cancellation**|❌|✅ Up to $10,000|✅ Up to trip cost|
|**Adventure Sports**|Add-on ($10/month)|✅ Included|Limited/add-on|
|**Pre-existing Conditions**|❌|❌|Limited|
|**Can Buy While Traveling**|✅|✅|❌|
|**Home Country Coverage**|✅ (30 days after 90 days abroad)|❌|Varies|
|**Best For**|🏆 Long-term, budget|Adventure sports|Traditional trips|

🎯 **Bottom Line:** SafetyWing wins on price and medical coverage. World Nomads wins on trip cancellation and adventure sports. Allianz wins on traditional trip protection and family coverage.

# What Insurance Actually Covers in Denmark

Understanding coverage specifics helps you avoid surprises when filing claims.

# Emergency Medical Coverage

All three providers cover:

* Emergency room visits
* Hospitalization
* Emergency surgery
* Prescription medications related to covered treatment
* Ambulance services
* Doctor consultations for acute illness or injury

They don't cover:

* Routine check-ups
* Pre-existing conditions (on standard plans)
* Elective procedures
* Dental work (except emergency dental from accidents)
* Eyeglasses or contact lenses (except from covered accidents)

# Medical Evacuation and Repatriation

This is where insurance justifies its cost. If you need to be transported to adequate medical facilities or evacuated back home for treatment, the costs are staggering—often $50,000-$150,000 depending on distance and method of transport.

All three providers include evacuation coverage, but amounts vary. SafetyWing offers $100,000, World Nomads offers $300,000-$500,000 depending on plan, and Allianz varies by policy tier.

Repatriation of remains is included if the worst happens—the insurance covers transporting your body back to your home country.

# Trip Interruption and Cancellation

Here's where products diverge significantly:

**SafetyWing Essential:** No trip cancellation coverage. Trip interruption covered only for medical emergencies requiring evacuation or hospitalization.

**World Nomads:** Trip cancellation up to $10,000 (Standard) or $15,000 (Explorer). Covers cancellation for illness, injury, death of family member, natural disasters at destination, and other covered reasons.

**Allianz:** Trip cancellation typically up to full trip cost on most plans. Excellent coverage for protecting expensive bookings.

If you've booked $4,000 worth of non-refundable hotels and flights, trip cancellation coverage becomes crucial. If you're traveling flexibly with minimal advance bookings, you probably don't need it.

# Adventure Activities and Sports

Denmark isn't a major adventure destination compared to Norway or Switzerland, but activities like:

* Cycling tours
* Kayaking
* Surfing (yes, Denmark has surf spots)
* Winter sports if you venture to nearby countries

SafetyWing requires the $10/month adventure sports add-on. World Nomads includes 200+ activities as standard. Allianz varies by plan but typically requires add-ons for adventure coverage.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** If you're not doing adventure activities in Denmark, don't pay for coverage you won't use. SafetyWing Essential without add-ons covers standard tourism perfectly fine.

# Filing Claims: What Actually Happens

I've filed travel insurance claims myself and helped dozens of travelers through the process. Here's what makes claims smooth versus nightmarish:

# The Claims Process Differences

**SafetyWing:** Upload receipts and medical documentation through their online portal. Average processing time is 2.7 days for straightforward claims. They've streamlined the process significantly—you don't need to mail physical documents or fill out complicated forms.

**World Nomads:** Online claim submission with document upload. Processing takes longer (typically 2-4 weeks for standard claims). The trade-off is thorough review and good customer service if you need guidance.

**Allianz:** Strong reputation for claims processing but more traditional approach. Multiple ways to file (online, phone, mail). Processing speed varies but generally excellent for trip cancellation claims.

# Documents You'll Need

Regardless of provider, keep:

* Itemized receipts from medical providers (not just credit card receipts)
* Medical reports or notes explaining treatment and diagnosis
* Proof of payment
* Police reports (for theft or loss)
* Documentation of delays or cancellations (airline letters, timestamps)

Danish healthcare providers are excellent about documentation. Just ask for itemized receipts and diagnosis notes in English if possible.

📋 **Claim Tip:** Take photos of all receipts immediately. Danish thermal printer receipts fade quickly, and you'll need legible copies for claims.

# Common Denmark Travel Scenarios: What's Covered

Let me walk through real situations and how insurance responds:

# Scenario 1: You twist your ankle cycling in Copenhagen

Without insurance: Visit a private clinic, pay €150-300 out of pocket for examination and X-rays.

With insurance: Pay upfront, submit receipts, get reimbursed. All three providers cover this as acute injury.

# Scenario 2: Your flight from Copenhagen gets cancelled

Without insurance: Pay for new flight and overnight accommodation yourself.

With insurance (World Nomads or Allianz): Covered under trip interruption. SafetyWing offers limited travel delay coverage ($100/day after 12 hours, max 2 days).

# Scenario 3: You develop appendicitis requiring emergency surgery

Without insurance: Full hospital bills potentially reaching €5,000-15,000 or more.

With insurance: Covered as emergency medical. All three providers handle hospitalization and emergency surgery. You may need to pay upfront and get reimbursed, or the insurance might work directly with the hospital depending on circumstances.

# Scenario 4: Your laptop gets stolen

Without insurance: Full loss.

With insurance: World Nomads and Allianz include baggage coverage. SafetyWing requires electronics add-on but then covers up to $5,000 annually with $2,000 per item.

# Special Considerations for Denmark

# Traveling to/from Neighboring Countries

Denmark borders Germany and connects to Sweden via the Öresund Bridge. If you're planning to visit multiple countries, verify your coverage extends throughout the Schengen Zone—SafetyWing and World Nomads both do, while some Allianz plans might need adjustment.

# Long-Term Stays and Remote Work

Denmark has become popular for digital nomads, especially Copenhagen. If you're staying longer than 90 days:

* You'll need a different visa (likely residence permit)
* SafetyWing's subscription model works perfectly for indefinite stays
* Consider whether you need routine medical coverage (SafetyWing Complete or local Danish insurance)

# Greenland and the Faroe Islands

Technically part of Denmark but not in the Schengen Area. Verify coverage if visiting—most travel insurance covers these territories, but Schengen visas don't apply there.

# Denmark-Specific Coverage Recommendations

**Copenhagen city break (4-7 days):**  
Allianz or World Nomads if you've booked expensive hotels. SafetyWing if you're keeping costs low and booking flexibly.

**Multi-week Denmark exploration:**  
SafetyWing Essential for best value and flexibility.

**Denmark + Scandinavia tour:**  
World Nomads Standard or SafetyWing Essential with adventure add-on if doing outdoor activities.

**Digital nomad stay (3-6 months):**  
SafetyWing Essential or Complete depending on whether you need routine care.

**Family vacation:**  
Allianz for comprehensive trip protection and family-friendly features.

# How to Buy Travel Insurance for Denmark

# Timing Matters

Buy insurance as soon as you book anything non-refundable. Some benefits (like pre-existing condition waivers on certain plans) require purchase within 14-21 days of your initial trip deposit.

SafetyWing lets you buy after departure, which is unique but means you won't have trip cancellation coverage for already-made bookings.

# What You'll Need

* Passport information
* Trip dates (or start date for open-ended travel)
* Destination countries
* Emergency contact information
* Sometimes medical history (for comprehensive plans)

# Getting Your Visa Letter

For Schengen visa applications, you need proof of insurance meeting the requirements. All three providers issue visa letters:

* SafetyWing: Instant PDF certificate after purchase
* World Nomads: Certificate available immediately
* Allianz: Certificate provided upon purchase

Bring printed copies to your visa appointment—some consulates won't accept electronic documents.

# What Not to Waste Money On

**Skip these unless you specifically need them:**

* ""Cancel for any reason"" coverage if you have flexible bookings
* Rental car coverage if your credit card provides it
* Adventure sports add-ons for basic city tourism
* Excess medical limits beyond $100,000-250,000 for short trips
* Trip interruption coverage when you have no advance bookings

🔥 **Hot Take:** Most travelers over-insure. Match coverage to actual risk. A week in Copenhagen requires far less coverage than six months of nomadic travel through multiple countries.

# Final Verdict: Which Insurance Should You Choose?

After years comparing policies and analyzing real claim scenarios, here's my honest recommendation:

**Choose SafetyWing Essential if:** You're traveling long-term, keeping costs low, want flexibility, or are already abroad. Best value for digital nomads and extended travelers. The $56.28/4-week price point is unbeatable for this level of medical coverage.

**Choose World Nomads if:** Adventure activities are central to your trip, you need strong trip cancellation protection, or you're combining Denmark with higher-risk destinations. Worth the premium for comprehensive adventure coverage.

**Choose Allianz if:** You've booked expensive non-refundable travel, prefer traditional insurance structures, traveling with family, or want maximum trip protection. Better for conventional vacations than nomadic travel.

All three meet Denmark's Schengen requirements and provide solid emergency medical coverage. The differences come down to trip style, duration, and specific needs.

Denmark's healthcare system is excellent, but it's expensive when you're paying out of pocket. Whether you need insurance for a visa or are choosing it voluntarily, having coverage means you can actually enjoy Denmark's design museums, harbor views, and excellent coffee without worrying about one clinic visit derailing your budget.",1,1768240121.0,CoverMadeEasy,0,1.0,False

**Tokyo Ghoul RPG System (WIP)**

# Stats

* **Strength** – Used for attacks, lifting objects, and counterattacks.
* **Fortitude** – Based on vitality, how long a character can sustain Kakuja/Arata, and carrying capacity.
* **Agility** – Used for dodging attacks, maximum movement per action, and allows up to 2 actions in the same turn.
* **Intellect** – Governs opportunity windows, critical chances, and tactical advantages in combat, such as acting between other characters’ turns.
* **Intent** – Represents Hunger for Ghouls and Willpower for Humans. This stat functions as the “mana” of the system and is mainly support-oriented.



# Races

There are **3 races**, each with their own origins, progression systems, and abilities.

# Ghouls

Ghouls possess **regeneration** and extra “mana”. They can spend **Hunger Points (HPF)** to regenerate **twice the amount spent**, up to **10 HPF per turn**, but they have lower maximum HP compared to humans.

Ghouls fight using **Kagunes**, which consume HPF while active (they function as the classes of the system):

* **Rinkaku** – Emerge from the lower back; generally balanced, leaning toward agility.
* **Koukaku** – Emerge from the upper/middle back; focused on brute strength, with reduced agility.
* **Bikaku** – Emerge from the tailbone; balanced but with high destructive potential, strength-oriented.
* **Ukaku** – Emerge from the shoulders; focused on agility and long-range attacks.

Ghouls also have **Hunger**, derived from the Intent stat. They can recover Hunger during combat by biting living or dead targets or devouring a corpse. These actions **cannot be performed during Kakuja transformation**.



# Advanced Ghoul Forms

At certain RC (level) thresholds, Ghouls can unlock advanced forms:

# Chimera (Level 13)

Allows mixing traits of two Kagune types with limitations.  
Examples:

* **Koukaku + Ukaku** – High destructive power and ranged attacks, but still slow.
* **Rinkaku + Ukaku** – Extremely agile hybrid capable of melee and ranged attacks, but with reduced damage.

# Kakuja (Level 15, exclusive path)

Unlocked by refusing the Chimera path.

* Much stronger and more defensive.
* Extremely high HPF upkeep (both to maintain the form and use abilities).
* Increases all stats by **50%**.
* Regeneration becomes constant, with the option to spend more HPF for faster regeneration.
* Represents a full monstrous transformation.



# Humans (CCG)

Humans have **higher maximum HP** and better defensive equipment, but **lower Willpower Points (WP)** than Ghouls.

They use **Quinques**, which are Kagunes transformed into weapons:

* **Rinkaku Quinque** – Agile and balanced, usually medium/light weapons.
* **Koukaku Quinque** – Heavy weapons with high strength requirements.
* **Bikaku Quinque** – Balanced weapons such as swords or medium-sized arms.
* **Ukaku Quinque** – High agility or long-range weapons (bows, daggers, ranged systems).

# Human Advanced Options

* **Dual Wielding (Level 13)** – Allows using two Quinques simultaneously, even from different Kakuhou types, unlocking unique mixed abilities and faster affinity gain.
* **Arata (Level 15)** – Unlocked by defeating a Kakuja.
   * Greatly boosts stats (**+75%**).
   * Requires Willpower upkeep.
   * Grants access to unique abilities based on the defeated Kakuja’s type.



# Quinx

Quinx are hybrids between Humans and Ghouls.  
They can use both **Kagunes and Quinques**, but cannot reach the maximum potential of either race.

* Higher overall stats during progression.
* Stronger early game and base forms.
* Must progress both **RC levels** and **Quinque affinity** simultaneously.

RC can be obtained through consumption or mission rewards.  
Because Quinx are feared by the CCG, they are fed according to **rank and trust level**.

Trust increases or decreases based on mission behavior:

* Consuming a target instead of neutralizing it lowers trust.
* Following mission orders increases reputation.



# Levels and Progression

Progression differs by race:

* **Ghouls** – Grow stronger by consuming humans or other Ghouls (consuming Ghouls yields more RC).
* **Humans** – Grow through **Quinque affinity**, based on time of use in combat, not necessarily kills.
* **Quinx** – Use both systems (RC + affinity), progressing them together.



# Origins / Ranks

# Ghouls

# Anteiku

Peaceful Ghouls focused on coexistence.

* **Rank C–B** – Low/medium food access, basic tools.
* **Rank A** – Good food, mission items, power amplifiers.
* **Rank S** – Full food access and items.
* **Rank SS** – Unrestricted access, mission choice.
* **Rank SSS** – Can assign missions; food RC gain capped.

**Anteiku Specialty:** Coffee  
At ranks C–A, Ghouls can reduce food quality by one level to drink coffee, gaining “satiety” for one scene and reducing HPF cost of abilities by 1 (except Kagune upkeep).



# Aogiri

Ghouls focused on racial supremacy.

Ranks function similarly to Anteiku, but:

**Aogiri Specialty:**  
Access to CCG-equivalent equipment (armor, protections, gear) matching their rank.



# Humans (CCG)

* **3rd Class Investigator** – Restricted Quinques, average equipment.
* **2nd Class Investigator** – Full access to Rank A/S Quinques.
* **1st Class Investigator** – Unlocks Quinque evolution and mixed abilities (if affinity allows).
* **Special Class** – Access to SS/SSS equipment, Arata, or Dual Wielding.



# Quinx (CCG)

* **3rd Class** – Limited gear, Rank C/B Quinque.
* **2nd Class** – Better feeding, Rank A/S Quinques.
* **1st Class** – Personalized Quinque with upgrades based on affinity.
* **Special Class** – Access to Quinques made from SS/SSS Ghouls.



# Final Note

For both Humans and Ghouls, **rank does not directly determine strength**.  
Power is defined by **actions, progression, and origin-based feats**, not rank alone.",0,1768240021.0,rpg,3,0.5,False

It's rough having to take my mom to work

My mom never learned how to drive and did not have a desire to learn. As a result, it leads to my dad taking her to work in the mornings. He didnt mind as he was a morning person and was able to accommodate her working schedule.

He passed away a couple of years ago and now that responsibility falls under my sister and I. Since I work later in the day, I have to get up in the mornings to take her to work and then try to take a short nap (if I can, it's really hard for me to fall back asleep) or just stay up and go to work. Those days suck honestly; I basically get up at 9:30 AM and I don't get home till almost midnight. If I have to take her multiple days in a row I end up having to go to bed immediately when I get home or just be tired the next day.

To be honest, this arrangement take such a huge toll on me. The total commute time is 45 minutes so sometimes it can be a drag. Admittedly my mom has noticed me dozing off behind the wheel which is kinda scary. Usually after the end of the drive I end up waking myself up and it's tough to go back to sleep and I end up staying up the whole day. Im usually fine at the start of work but as the hours pass I start getting super tired. I dont know how I do it sometimes, I dont drink coffee either lol

My sister seems okay with it because she works later and for less hours so she can actually get some shut eye but for me it's just rough. If I want to get the best possible sleep I end up having to sacrifice my free time, and honestly I enjoy my free time. To me it's not fair everyone else can have longer free time than I do just because they don't harbor this kind of arrangement I have. I have a coworker that keeps asking me to go to the gym with him after work at times and I basically end up denying it because of the responsibility (I'd really love to go with him sometime though).

I don't know man, I love my mom but I absolutely hate having to take her to work. It gets so tiring honestly. I hope that doesn't make me a monster.

I just took apart my group head and the seals were looking pretty great compared to other rebuilds. They hadn't been lubricated for at least 7 years (i know! I'm doing better!). I do admit the lever was hard enough to operate that it was de-riveting from the square part but ya live and ya learn 😅 any negative concerns about silicone? It just kinda doesn't seem like the kind of thing I want to consume slowly in any amount. I was alao shocked to learn that PFAS or reflon was in some  food grade lubricants. Like, ok I acknowledge that someone decided this was ok and nobody  got cancer from this alone right away, but not for me. Whereas the inventor of Vaseline ate a teaspoon a day and lived to be close to or over 100.

One of my other areas of concern or interest is in doing this as a maintenance schedule. So far, I have had to slightly damage the main group o-ring that holds the shower screen. I only have EPs with a shower screen held in by this o-ring alone, no center screw. So are people lubricating the group on a 6 month schedule replacing this every time, or does this frequency of removal aid in their saving the o-ring, or maybe down to annual replacement? I know the piston with the stwm nuts removed can be used to push the screen and o-ring out when they're not too aged and hardened.

I also admit to not backflushing the group, because how do you? I would have to practically bolt or clamp it down somehow, to be able to build and apply pressure with the lever and turn and release the portafilter in bursts like with a commercial machine.  Maybe some overnight or cooling cycle soak and flush? There was a lot of coffee oil in there. (Shame) I guess I wasn't in the habit of lifting for flush water because of how hard the lever was to operate for so long.

I screwed up and ran an iron on it and left a few of these marks (they are fairly mild, most visible in direct sunlight as pictured). I know I was dumb.

First off, can anyone with more experience than me help me diagnose if this is trapped moisture vs damage to the finish? I know the possible solutions will depend on that.

I have tried multiple rounds of hair dryer/iron on low heat with a dish towel as first steps and didn’t really see any improvement. I’m scared to take any further steps (rubbing mayo on it? Really?) until I’ve got a better idea of what I’m dealing with. I don’t currently know what type of finish it is but am open to trying to figure that out.

There are a few scratches/dings in the table that lead me to believe the veneer is probably thick enough to be refinished if need be, but I would realistically take it to a professional if I ended up resorting to that.

1qb1jvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qb1jvb/what_happened_to_me_migraine_tia_stroke/,What happened to me? Migraine? TIA? Stroke?,"33F. I experienced some scary visual ""attacks"" over the weekend that almost felt like a stroke. It started on Friday. **EDIT TO WHOEVER DOWNVOTED ME ALREADY. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY DOCTOR BUT IT'S A WAYS AWAY BECAUSE HE IS BUSY AND WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE**. **I'M NOT ASKING REDDIT TO DIAGNOSE ME.** Temporary blindness is strange and scary because I have **NO history of migraines**. Please don't punish me for asking for other ideas because nobody I know has had this happen to them. Thank you.

My only known pre-existing condition is hypothyroidism, which I take Synthroid for. I've taken Alesse (birth control) for years without issue.

On Friday, I was having a harder time reading my computer screen at the end of the work day. I thought it was eye strain. It was dusk when I drove home. Lights from other cars were really blinding me. When I got home, I noticed the sunspots (flash blindness?) from the headlights wasn't going away, but getting worse.

I went into the house and realized I couldn't see the ""5"" in ""5:17"" on my stove. The left side of my peripheral was patchy in both eyes. My husband also verified I couldn't see well on my left side. It passed in half an hour and my vision gradually got better. Our health advice line told me to go to the ER to get checked out.

I was too busy feeling anxious about the sudden blindness to pay much attention to how the rest of my body was feeling. I didn't get a headache after but felt pretty tired.

The ER went as expected. Because of my age, they did a quick vision exam and physical exam. They told me it was a migraine and to come back in if it happens again. (there's no way I would even get thru triage before another attack would pass). Get an appt with my family doctor, have him order imaging, but probably stress caused a painless migraine.

It happened again on Saturday night. This was more mild. It seemed to only affect my right eye's peripheral vision. I couldn't focus on text or my phone. It lasted about 10 minutes then went back to normal.

Sunday morning, it happened again. I'd just had a few sips of coffee and was reading a book. Suddenly it was like my eyes couldn't focus on the page at all. The words were blurry, I could still kinda... read them? Even though they looked like squiggles. The peripheral vision in my left eye was affected. This lasted about 15 minutes. Once it passed I had a dull headache but mostly felt like my head was stuffed full of cotton. I felt really tired. I ended up napping 3 hours that afternoon despite getting 7 hours the night before. It took me longer to assemble a Lego set I'm working on because I was having trouble finding some pieces that looked similar. I chalked that up to tiredness.

I haven't had any disturbances today but I feel tired. Not physically tired, but like my brain is tired. I'm at work today but feel like I'll fall asleep as soon as I get home.

I have **no** history of migraines.

\*\*\*

A few things to note. During these events I felt my pulse change. I know a bit of that is anxiety, but when it started happening it's like I could feel my heart beat stronger, but different than anxiety (trust me, I know what anxiety feels like). There was some sluggishness. My doctor noticed a new heart murmur last year. We weren't sure if I'd always had it or had recently shown up. There is a history of stroke, TIA, and heart problems in my family.

I was taking Vyvanse until August. I didn't like how it made my heart feel and it wasn't working well for me anymore.

I also had covid for the second time in October.  It took me out for a solid week with nausea and vomiting. I felt fatigue after that but thought it resolved by December.

Thanks for any help or ideas with this! I'm not sure if I need to push for any imaging or tests, or if I should just treat these as silent migraines and move on with my life.",0,1768239707.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

For one, I love those four, as Ava Nitia's tax returns helped me out of difficult spots, Kim Quy gave me governorship of Hanan Pacha and put me in charge of a colonization project to rebuild the ruined planet. I went to the ball with Admiral Rao, and I had drinks with High Hegemon Daud, a stand up guy who I can relate to who came from nothing to something like me, not like that turtleneck-wearing dickhead on Kazeron. 

Which makes it hard to admit that I have been using AI Cores on my colonies and stations behind their backs for a few years, occasionally selling some to Yunris Kween (F, Age Data Super Redacted) and Tri-Tachyon, putting Barrow (M, Age Data Redacted) in the Oldslaught and have been in contact with Midnight Dissonant (F, Age Data Redacted), as well as doing black site research to learn how to DIY a production line for Gamma and Beta Cores.

Other than the usual AI inspections I had to threaten away with my giant fleet of carriers, I got a call from Midnight Dissonant that she had gotten a tip off that not only the Hegemony is sending a dedicated AI Inspection fleet towards my colonies but they are sending a strike force to one of her Remnant systems, which would result in a ""total AI genocide"" if we didn't intervene. 

So I showed up, tailed the Heggies to their staging area, then lied to them that I would help them. Then, I sent false information to them so they underestimated the Remnants in the system, and then we gave them the Midway treatment of bombing the shit out of them with lots of carriers and fighters. Not one Hegemony ship had escaped the system and every officer and crew man died off. Then, I intercepted three Hegemony AI Inspection Fleets, and bombed them into space dust.

I then got urgent calls from Hegemony High Command and Iron Shell Tax Bureau. High Hegemon Daud told me he's disappointed in me, Rao said that she's breaking up with me for being a traitor and betrayer, Kim Quy revoked my governorship of Hanan Pacha, and Ava Nitia charged me for the destruction of Hegemony Fleets and said that ""she won't be accepting donuts or coffee from me ever again.""

Despite getting a Remnant Dronenought to put Nightingale in, and Remnants and Dustkeepers as my automated escort fleets, and a steady supply of mass produced AI Cores to sell to Tri-Tachyon for profit, I have lost three good friends and a potential SO in the Hegemony.

Fixed the second I played a video.","As the title says, I had my pc running when I woke up this morning and was having a shower and was about to grab some breakfast and a coffee to sit down and watch a youtube video as I usually do (the video was open and I was tabbed into my browser). Then, while I was sitting at my desk checking notifications on both my pc and phone, suddenly both my monitors went completely blank saying no signal. The pc remained on, so I figured I'd try changing the ports of the DP cables. Nothing. Still blank, so I look it up and find posts about it but found one particular post where OP had mentioned they go blank but he can sometimes still hear audio. Well, wanting to see if my situation was similar I had decided to put my headphones on and press space bar hoping I was tabbed into my browser, luckily I was because as soon as the video started to play I immediately got signal back and now its working perfectly.

Does anyone know how or why this happened? The pc is basically new, I had it build professionally by a very reputable local shop. I've had it for about 2 months now. I'll list specs incase it helps narrow down the issue. I mainly wish to ask because I want to see if this is something that could cause a major issue or could signify that my gpu is defective and I should use warranty. Recently I had another issue, where after downloading a driver, I restarted my pc and went into a loop of a ""system ran into an error"" and rebooting. So I forcibly shut it off with the power button, booted it up and had a orange light on my motherboard (I believe for DRAM), no signal on my monitors (not the first time it happened but I simply swapped the ports for my monitors and it worked, not this time though). After trying to fix it, I just left it on and went on reddit looking for answers, never did find anything as it decided that after about 10 minutes it would send signal again and this time it was one monitor showing the startup screen, followed by texts that kept changing but basically was saying bios was trying to resolve the issue I think? In the end, it booted without issue and that was the last time I had a major issue aside from when my pump died on my AIO. The newest issue isnt exactly ""major"" but I'm concerned about why it happened without any reason to and if it may develop into a major issue.

I have to head out somewhere and I usually shut down my pc before going out for any length of time in fear of the infamous connector melting issues (I dont want it to occur ever, but especially if Im not home). If it has any issues when I power it on, I will edit this post or make a comment on it.

We’ll be screening The Drop, a Brooklyn-set crime drama starring James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy, with several scenes filmed right here in Marine Park. It’s a great local film with a strong neighborhood connection and a perfect pick for a relaxed winter evening.

While many of our core events are designed specifically for young adults, this movie night—like our Live Music events—is intentionally open to the wider community. These events are about creating accessible, welcoming spaces where people can connect locally.

We’re also in the process of planning to file as a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit, focused on strengthening community ties, supporting local businesses, and offering accessible programming that benefits the neighborhood as a whole.

Please RSVP on Partiful so we can plan accordingly:

Fairly straightforward offer, rather fun. Progressed much quicker once I realized I didn't have to win the levels, just play them. Definitely utilize unlimited hearts, and just keep failing levels by running out of space. I did that once or twice a day for 15-30 minutes of unlimited hearts and completed the offer in just under a week and a half.

We currently have a couch that is far too big for the space that only 2 people will ever sit on (no one wants to be in the middle). The front door is the main thoroughfare through the house back to our hallway against the rug, so we can't encroach on that space. The window seat is too shallow to sit on. We have two little kids that sometimes play upstairs, so we don't want a coffee table.

Goals:

* Seating for 4 adults
* Movable ottoman so that there is the option to put feet up
* No seating in path of doorway

Options we have thought of so far:

* Loveseat and two accent chairs, small ottoman
* 2 bigger armchairs and 2 small accent chairs
* Apartment sized couch (?) and 1 bigger armchair

I go to community college and I have a job so I’m not at home much. My mom always complains about how I’m always busy and that she misses my company (recently she’s been calling me selfish for not spending as much time with her as I can because she could “die any day”) but whenever I am around, she gets pissed. For example, an hour ago I came downstairs to make breakfast and get some coffee and she just started going off on me about how she’s convinced I wait until she comes downstairs just so “I can take up space in the kitchen”. I got pissed and told her that this is why I stay in my room 24/7 or im out of the house. We kept going back and forth and I said that I hated living here. Now that I’m reflecting, I don’t think that was the right thing to say but unfortunately it’s how I’ve felt since I was in highschool. I’d like to move out but it’s just not possible. Most of the money I make goes towards bills in the house, so I barely have anything saved up. I just feel stuck here and it’s making me anxious. What if I never end up moving out? What if I stay here until she dies? I know it’s a crazy jump but I just feel really hopeless right now and being around her just makes it worse.

**The Hard Truth: Your Books (not your books, Chode) Is Most Likely Being Adapted Right Now**

Hard truth up front: most of you have been reading the top books from the sloopy fest that is BookTok and, because of that, all the big players have been chucking around money buying up the books to be turned into movies, you see. They found that, like workloads, romance movies help outsource the seduction and yearning that the primary consumer wants but their real life fated mate can’t provide. This has driven big money into romance and, as such, we’re going to be experiencing everything from the extended universe of Emily Henry to the works of Rebecca Yarros to the world of ACTOR (there’s now more than a 0% chance that it gets made). Your favourite book the one that you own, have made many notes in and read five times over, and that now acts as your Wi‑Fi password is getting the big screen treatment.

**Understanding What You Might Already Be Doing Wrong**

Have you ever experienced any of the following after hearing your favourite book is being adapted?

* Sleepless nights over the casting. I’ve seen you all, worried about if the actor they cast as the MMC will have the right shade of brown hair, which is vital for all the major storylines and plot points. Yes, they might have the looks, smarts, muscles (the minimum standard of a six‑pack), but all you really care about is whether the hair is right or not. Sorry to break it to y’all, but it’s not.
* Deep diving into the screenwriter’s history. Who is this person? No one really knows, but they are now the most important person in your life, it seems, because they control how the book will play out. So, you must research them in depth, gain a full understanding of their work and make sure that they can deliver the script that matters until they change writers and you’ve got to do it all over again. They might change the story a little, but don’t stress about something that is outside your control (unless you are the screenwriter; then, good luck).
* Joining multiple subreddits. It started off with you in just the standard subreddits, but now anything and everything that covers the book and adaptation you’re all over (including the toxic and nontoxic ones), fighting with other users about what should and should not change, sharing your hot takes and throwing downvotes around like its confetti.
* 1,000 different fan castings. Yes, the first 999 were not perfect, but this time you’ve done it. You found the perfect casting for who should play each character; you researched their work schedules, and it’s a timeline where everyone could work together on the film and they like each other enough to get the job done.

If any of this sounds true for you, you might be setting yourself up to have too many expectations for the adaptation and then not appreciate the craftsmanship that’s gone into it. So, it’s good to take a step back (apart from Reddit I need the upvotes to validate this whole operation).

**Cold Hard Truth One**

The movie and the book are different mediums and, as such, have both their strengths and weaknesses.

Movies are not famed for their internal monologues that would give you a deep dive into the character’s mind, history, feelings and emotions. In lieu of such doorstop thick text, we’re presented with a mixture of the following:

* A glance that holds eye contact one second longer than is normal.
* A montage of training/travelling/sad emotions.
* Dialogue along the lines of “It’s fine”, “If only they knew how I felt”, and “You wouldn’t know.”

Is this a betrayal by the screenwriter and showrunners of the book? No, it’s the limitation of the medium at hand. However, it’s not all bad news. If you ever read a spicy scene and wondered how it could be done, you might not have to wonder any more, as you’re treated to the visual display that, yes, your parents will walk in at this moment and ask why the gentleman has wings (and what that tail is currently doing,  looking at you, *Avatar*).

**Cold Hard Truth Two Electric Boogaloo**

Xaden, Rhysand, and other similarly unrealistic expectations of men that have been manifested into written material are, thankfully for the workload of The Hague not real. As such, when it’s time to cast these characters onto the big screen, the casting team is restricted by the available acting population. This means that whoever ends up as Xaden will most likely not have gold flecks in his eyes, or the exact height, muscle profile, jaw movement, and general all round “fuck you” attitude down to the letter. You might have to accept compromises, such as only being willing to simmer the world and not burn it down completely.

**The Home Run**

The casting is out, we’ve seen the trailers, and you’re already starting to make notes on what’s different (Starbucks in *Game of Thrones* over Costa Coffee). It’s back to your final/second final reread of the book so you’re mentally ready to sit in and tick off every area that you knew they would change and get wrong.  
You sit down, press play, holding onto your emotional support Kindle, fuelled by your beverage of choice and whisper to yourself, “Please be at an exceptional level of good  at least let it be worth a rewatch.”

Content happens. You might laugh, you might cry, you might yell, “They ruined that scene!” before declaring that they got the meet cute just the way you dreamed of it being. Or you might give up and doomscroll on your phone ten minutes in.

Either way, it’s over, it’s done, and no matter how you felt, you know deep down what’s coming next. Yep the Reddit mega threads.

**Mega threads for Discussion / FMF for Everything Else**

Now, if this were a serious guide, I would suggest that you take time to digest the material, avoid jumping on any hype or hate right away, and make sure you approach it with a clean head and no bias. But I scrapped that goal to write more serious stuff, so go nuts.  
Most subreddits will have some form of mega thread because they don’t want everyone making a new post to yell or praise what they found. The best thing about this is that you can look at the number of upvotes and see if your opinion lines up with the top comments to understand how in tune you are with the hive mind. There are also other outlets such as BookTok, YouTube and even smashing out a Goodreads essay even if it’s about the movie and not the book that’s very much still valid and unchanged. Don’t Worry It’s Almost Over

**The tier list. I know you, you know you, and I know that you know that I know you’ve got a tier list ready to go.**

What was all the rage last year and (shakes magic eight ball) what I can see being this year is a good old fashioned tier list the perfect way for people who don’t know you to silently judge you based on your selection and ranking system. Now, you could go with the classic S–F tier titles, but if you’re looking for more fun options, as always, Salty provides:

* Actual cinema, book vibes untouched
* Just stick it right in (my veins)
* Would rewatch with snacks and scrolling
* Fine, whatever
* Time thief energy
* Eternal grudge fuel

**Final Boss: Acceptance**

That’s it the life cycle and expectations of what happens when your favourite book becomes a movie. The best part? Our favourites change, and you may soon find yourself getting ready to go around all over again.  
So, just remember:

* This will happen again.
* More books will be selected from the BookTok most hyped list and find their way to the big screen (*~~Silver Elite~~*, Maga Elite anyone?).
* Some, like your posting, will be mid.
* Some, like my posting, will be great.

But look on the bright side: at least you’ve got more background audio to have on while doomscrolling away.  
And that’s what really matters more sloopy material for the Sloopies.

Hope you have enjoyed,

Salty.

P.S no this is not about people we meet on vacation, but it might end up being  
P.P.S if the love hypothesis movie does not have the >!sun cream!< scene I will riot.

1qb1a2z,https://v.redd.it/gtcij4t4dycg1,I built a privacy-first spending tracker because I'm tired of subscriptions and data mining.,"**Hey everyone 👋,**

I’m a solo UX/UI designer/Dev who recently decided to build my own spending tracker.

I wasn't trying to “disrupt” the fintech industry. I just had three very specific requirements for a finance tool that I couldn't find combined in a single app, so I decided to code it myself.

**1. True Privacy**   
I didn't want my financial data on a server, and I didn't want to be analyzed. My app, **BentoMoney**, is offline-first. It uses a local SQLite database on your device. There are no accounts, no login screens, and absolutely no analytics or usage tracking. The data literally cannot leave your phone because there is no server code to receive it.

**2. Simplicity**   
I found that most apps (and my own Excel sheets) were too cluttered. I didn't want to analyze complex charts while standing in line for coffee. I designed the UX to give me exactly one number: **“Available Today”**. It calculates what is safe to spend right now based on my monthly limits and fixed expenses. If I spend less, the extra money rolls over to tomorrow automatically.

**3. No Subscriptions**   
I hate subscriptions as much as anyone, so the main focus is the **Lifetime Purchase** option ($24.99). I believe, if you buy a utility, you should own it forever.

However, I do offer a small annual subscription ($9.99/year) for two practical reasons:

1. **Apple's Trial System:** The easiest way to offer a seamless 7-day free trial on the App Store is through the subscription flow.
2. **Lower Entry:** Some people prefer a smaller upfront cost to try it out for a year before committing.

But the goal isn't to hook you on recurring payments - the Lifetime option is there so you can “buy it once, use it forever”.

**The Tech Stack:** It’s built with React Native and Expo. I spent a lot of time on the details - like smooth animations and haptic feedback, because I wanted it to feel like a high-quality native app, not a web wrapper. iOS only for now, but the Android version is in the works.

I’d love for you to check it out and let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions/comments.   
  
Thanks!

1qb145h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qb145h/need_advices_was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague/,Need advices. Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a woman colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

We live together and generally have a great relationship. However, there’s a woman at his office named Sarah. Mark calls her his ""work wife,"" which already rubs me the wrong way, but he insists it’s just a common corporate joke.
The issue came to a head yesterday. I decided to surprise Mark at his office with lunch since I was in the area. Before I went in, I stopped at a cafe to grab us coffees. I realized I couldn't remember if he wanted his latte with oat milk or almond milk (he’s been switching things up for a diet), so I tried calling him. No answer.
I took a gamble on oat milk and headed up. When I got to his desk, Sarah was there. They were laughing over a spreadsheet. I set the coffee down, and the first thing Mark said was:
""Oh, thanks babe! Is this oat? Ah, I’m actually doing almond this week, but it’s fine!""
Sarah immediately chimed in with, ""Oh, I could have told you that! I got him his morning almond misto at 9:00 AM sharp. I knew you’d be back on the almond train today, Marky.""
She then reached over and straightened his collar while saying it. Mark didn't flinch or pull away; he just thanked her.
I felt a hot surge of annoyance. I told him I had to get going, left the food, and ignored his texts the rest of the afternoon. When he got home, he told me I was being ""weirdly cold"" over a cup of milk. I told him it wasn't about the milk—it was about the fact that Sarah seems to be more ""in tune"" with his daily life than I am, and the collar-touching felt disrespectful.
He laughed and said I’m ""insane"" and ""massively overreacting."" He says Sarah is just ""type A"" and looks out for everyone in the office.",1,1768238741.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.6,False

Still trying to figure out optimal timing and dosage.  Been taking 1 first thing in the morning before coffee, and last thing at night at bedtime.

I had 4 days in a row with no bile diarrhea and I was thrilled.  I was So excited I got cocky and thought I could eat a fairly normal dinner last night. 

Was I wrong! I had two small smoked pork ribs, a spoon each of macaroni salad and redskin potato salad, and green beans sautéed in olive oil. I put a light smear of butter on a slice of rustic bread and MAN did I pay the price for this meal. 

Idk WHY I didn’t stop myself because olive oil is a trigger food for me, as is the strong brew of medium roast coffee I made this morning. It took almost 2.5 hours this morning for my system to reset.. and I was miserable. The medium roast coffee is a trigger although I can drink dark roast with no problems. I don’t need coffee either way- but I like the taste and the ritual. 

Looking at this episode I may have been ok if I took an extra Colestipol tablet after my dinner and then my usual tablet at bedtime several hours later. I have no side effects at all from the tablets

Itching then burning then mental health decline and turned into a bit of a recluse. Recently stopped some bad habits like coffee and weed.

Calah wasn’t trying to be somebody she wasn’t. She was authentically herself from the beginning, whether we liked it or not.

Am told Bla Bla bar and The Shakespeare pub are good for early evenings as is Coffeedelia cafe

Any other suggestions ? Any local bars / street food joints / places to see / experiences to try - i’d rather try smaller authentic local food than fancy kazakh cuisine places.

Any suggestions would be appreciated especially on friday / saturday and sunday nights

Even simple words can behave completely differently across languages, leaving learners confused and uncertain when to use them.  For me, this is what usually causes me to hesitate speaking in a new language. 

# The Frustrating Reality of Cross-Language Word Mapping

As a language learner, you've probably experienced this scenario: You confidently use a word you've learned, only to receive confused looks from native speakers. What went wrong?

The problem is that most dictionaries and language apps simply offer direct translations without explaining the **usage contexts** that make all the difference. Consider these challenging examples:

# Example 1: Spanish ""Encender""

A basic dictionary might tell you that ""encender"" means ""to turn on."" But in reality, it's used in contexts like:

* ""Encender la luz"" → ""Turn on the light"" ✓
* ""Encender una conversación"" → ""Spark/start a conversation"" (not ""turn on a conversation"") ✓
* ""Encender la pasión"" → ""Ignite passion"" (not ""turn on passion"") ✓
* ""Encender un fuego"" → ""Start a fire"" ✓

# Example 2: English ""Get""

The word ""get"" is deceptively simple but has dozens of meanings depending on context:

* ""I need to get milk"" → acquiring something
* ""I get your point"" → understanding
* ""She gets nervous"" → becoming/experiencing
* ""The cake gets eaten"" → passive construction

# Example 3: Spanish ""Tomar""

This versatile verb can mean:

* ""Tomar un café"" → ""To drink a coffee""
* ""Tomar un taxi"" → ""To take a taxi""
* ""Tomar una decisión"" → ""To make a decision""
* ""Tomar una foto"" → ""To take a photo""

Without proper examples, how would you know when to use ""tomar"" versus other verbs like ""beber"" or ""hacer""?

# Introducing Usage Examples: Context is Everything

To solve this problem, I've added a new **Word Usage Examples** feature to StoryTime Language. This tool bridges the gap between simple translations and real-world usage by showing you exactly how words function in different contexts.

Here's how it works:

1. **Tap any saved vocabulary word** in your collection
2. **Select ""Show Usage Examples""** from the menu
3. **Browse multiple authentic examples** showing different contexts
4. Each example includes:
   * The original sentence in your target language
   * An accurate translation showing how meaning shifts
   * Usage notes explaining nuances and cultural context
   * Difficulty level indicators

# Learn Languages the Way They're Actually Spoken

Language learning isn't about memorizing equivalents—it's about understanding how native speakers actually communicate. With Usage Examples, you'll:

* Develop confidence in using words correctly
* Avoid embarrassing mistranslations
* Sound more natural in your target language
* Build a deeper understanding of cultural context
* Move beyond word-for-word translation

The next time you encounter a word with multiple meanings, don't guess—check the Usage Examples and know exactly how to use it like a native speaker.

I follow Stevey Coughman, Luke Lamiprung, Oily Dickards, Louie Ben, Xioyomama, Lindy Hop, J. Martian Brown, Blooey, and twenty seven other channels. Every morning, my phone wakes me up with an alert of all the polyglot videos I missed, and I religiously hatewatch every clip across YouTube, Instagram, DickDock, and Twitter.

If I see just one more video, where some bright-eyed, overly friendly kid sells you the most trite and tired knowledge as revolutionary and personal discoveries, I will start shouting at my computer. The other thing that bugs me about them is the promotion of shallowness over depth. ""Ooh, I speak so many languages. Look at me. I am so brilliant."" And then they speak roughly at an a2 level and the topic of conversation is always language learning itself or how they want to travel to that country or eat the food. People who are not knowledgeable about language learning lap that shit up. In this world, somebody who learnt 10 languages to a vocabulary of a2 (1000 words) is a more successful language learner than somebody who learnt one language with a vocabulary of 10,000 words because that one is missing the poly in front of the glot. But why? Why have we allowed for that to become the metric to measure success in language learning? Why is making meaningless small talk in 10 languages and ""shocking natives"" by blabbering out a coffee order more respected than deep knowledge and expertise? I just doubt that these polyglots even ever could find the time to do something meaningful in any of their language because as soon as they might even have a smidgen of anything approaching competence, they are off again learning ""Where is the train station"" in the next obscure language to perform their linguistic party tricks somewhere in the streets of Bumfuckistan in front of shocked natives, who are just confused and would be much happier if you left them alone. I just no longer respect polyglotism as a concept or measurement of success.

Sorry about the rant but I just had some dead time where there weren't any new videos available, so I had to do SOMETHING-- oh shit, a new Matt vs Hentai video just dropped, see you polylosers later.",8,1768238226.0,languagelearningjerk,7,1.0,False

Exam pressure is exhausting, and anxiety can make it so hard to focus, even when you actually understand the material.
During exams, I used to feel tense all the time—my mind scattered, staring at the page without really absorbing anything.
I tried NeuroGum Energy & Focus Gum during exam season, and honestly, it didn’t perform miracles, but it helped more than I expected.
It made me feel calmer and more mentally clear, without the jittery feeling or heart racing I usually get from strong coffee. The combination of a moderate dose of caffeine with L-theanine really made a difference for me.
What I liked most is how fast it works. I’d chew a piece before studying or when I felt overwhelmed, and it helped my mind settle and focus again.
It didn’t remove exam stress completely, but it definitely reduced my anxiety and helped me study with more calm and concentration.
This is just my personal experience, but during a stressful exam period, it helped me stay more focused and less overwhelmed—and that alone meant a lot.

GYM:  *disclaimer* i did start walking up to 4 miles per day when i got a new puppy last march so this was not cold turkey but i was not lifting weights.

im doing primarily heavy kettlebell work 4 days a week, doing specific V02 max training twice a week (a form of high intensity work for 4 mins then 3 mins off repeated 4 times) and hiking 4-6 miles once a week on top of puppy walks totaling ~ 3 miles per day. This is after a ten year primarily sedentary period of extreme weight gain. I was 397lbs in August. I spent so much time away from scales that I was thinking I was in the 330s. Imagine being nearly 70lbs heavier than you thought and that thought was based on the knowing youd gained since last scale time (years). Id successfully managed to talk my way around being weighed at drs visits. Im sure some of you in here can relate to that.  

Monday - Saturday 
My coffee gets 2 tsp wheat fiber, 10g collagen 5 g creatine.  An hour later I eat 5 eggs cooked in green chili sauce or Rotel with 2 tsp parm on top. After my workout I eat 4 servings of 0% Greek with half cup blueberries, tsp honey, tsp saigon cinnamon, 5g creatine, 3tbsp chia seeds and every other day 1/4 cup walnuts.
I still get my taco shop tacos on tuesdays but the other 5 days I have ground beef or steak twice a week, pork tenderloin once a week, sprouted tofu stir fry once a week and I either have chicken thighs or salmon one night. 
Carb choices are white or sweet potatoes, quinoa but only on tofu night, butternut squash, carrots 
Veggies are broccoli, pre made frozen stir fry mix, asparagus, zucchini, brussel sprouts, green beans. 3 nights a week I add steamed beats or raw sourkraut. 
If I want desert I get apple, banana, melon, pineapple or 2 dates. 

One day a week I get 1 huge serving of an instapot meal with beans, tons of leafy greens and protein. My favorite two are redbeans and rice with a bunch of kale crammed in or black eyed peas and turnip greens.  I can eat anything else I want or been craving within 5 hours of the that. 

Essentially my 6 days diet with a few specific supplements (fish oil, CoQ10, Tumeric, magnesium, D3/K2 and a couple others) is designed to cause 3 leucine spikes per day, average 2200 calories, 180G protein, 70G fat with a 3-4:1 omega 6:3 ratio and balance sat fats with others, and 200G carbs with 40G of fiber split soluble/insoluble, ensure all micronutrients come in and respect all the leading edge sports science/longevity tools.  Preparation & seasoning varies to keep it interesting and tasty.

ITS FREAKING WORKING. The fact that im even doing what im doing in the gym is astounding and I feel great in there. I’m averaging 3.5bs lost per week although thats expected to continue to taper down as I get close to my goal weight, people are already saying wow WTF have you been doing and its not quite been 5 months and my apple watch sleep score is averaging 91.  
As of this morning I am 320lbs and I feel like an entirely different person. Im even more excited about the results given that 4 days at Thanksgiving and 4 days at Christmas I didn take meds those weeks and I ate lots of fun garbage foods and drank alcohol.

1qb0te7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/1qb0te7/accident_with_rental_car_in_bc_tires_did_not_have/,Accident with Rental car in BC. Tires did not have legal tread depth,"I recently rented a car from Kelowna airport, picked up at about midnight and drove 1.5hrs north where I had a room booked for the night, where is sleep and get up early to drive to a nearby ski mountain.  It was an AWD suv that had reported m+s tires (not upgraded snow tires).

The drive from the airport was a bit snowy and wet but everything went fine.

The next morning I'm on the road at 8am, There's a bit of snow on the road and ice but otherwise pretty clear - I've driven in the mountains plenty and take it slow!  I stopped for a breakfast sandwich and coffee and was on my way for about another hour to the ski hill.

No less than a few minutes later on a relatively flat and straight piece of the TransCanada highway the vehicle loses control and starts sliding sideways towards the ditch to the right of the lane I'm travelling in.  I was probably doing around 80kmh which I believe was below the speed limit (90-100).   Unfortunately before I could hit the ditch there was a concrete light standard that I tried to steer to avoid but I hit it at speed with the front corner of the vehicle, the airbags all went off and the car rested in the ditch a few hundred feet further.

Immediately the car automatically called the manufacturer roadside unbenounced to me and they called 911.  Numerous drivers pulled over.

I had no physical injuries I was aware of.

I called the rental company roadside with long hold.  Never got in touch with them during this time .  The car manufacturer emergency attendant that was communicating through the car was incredibly attentive, called the police and a tow truck, and checking to see if I was okay.

Within 15 minutes an rcmp police officer showed up, took my info and started their report.

A few very kind bystanders had stopped and waited, turns out they were also headed to the same ski area.

I called my friends as well and all of these people advised me to check the tires on the car.

Sure enough they all had very low tread depth!  They were m+s rated tires (minimum requirement by law in BC).

The police officer also checked the tires and stated to myself and the bystanders they ""did NOT have have legal tread depth"".  I asked he put this in his report.  He said he would and I'd receive the report in the mail (in Ontario where I live).

Once the tow trick came the officer advised I was free to go - the bystanders had offered to take me up to the ski hill where I had friends I was supposed to join and a pre planned place to stay.  Amazing!

I didn't receive any other information, no ticket was issued and that was that.

I called the rental car company roadside a number of times over the next 2 days, asked for another vehicle and made sure I'd submit everything I needed.

I was advised I would have to go back to Kelowna to get another vehicle, and even after hours on the phone with numerous people (who I believe were operating out of call centers in the USA) it was clear they were of little assistance.

They did inform me of a case number, no further action was required by me and that they had received the police report.

Fast forward 5 days later (1 day away from my scheduled return of the vehicle and subsequent flight home) and I received a voicemail and email from the rental car local location with pictures of the car and indicated no idea of the conversations I'd already had with the parent company.   I replied pretty sternly that I'd want a refund, provided this story and pictures of the bald tires.

Ive received nothing since (5 days later).

I've yet to receive the police report.

I'd like a refund of the rental fees and I definitely have some PTSD. I haven't seen anyone yet about it but driving as a passenger in the mountains is horrifying and I've had a couple bad dreams...

What should I look to do moving forward?

Would really appreciate feedback from people who’ve done similar legs.

I'm traveling solo at a flexible pace aiming to focus on a mix of culture & social energy, some nature, and a few slower stops. I'll be staying in budget to mid-range lodging but not trying to rough it.

**Here's my rough route for now:**

**Mumbai** – arrival, adjust to India, food & neighborhoods

**Ahmedabad / Gir (Sasan Gir area)** – culture + wildlife (lions)

**Goa** – beaches, social vibe, downtime

**Jaipur** – There for **Holi** (**Mar 2-4**), history, architecture, Old City

**Kochi / Kerala** – Overnight backwaters stay, slower pace, culture, reset

**Rishikesh and Shimla** – mountains, walking towns, cooler air

**Mumbai** for departure

**Looking for advice:**

My cousins and I are from Florida, and we need some advice on our itinerary. This is our first trip to NYC, so we have no idea what to expect. We are all in our early to mid-20s. We plan on staying in hoboken so we tried to account for travel time as well. Being suburban south floridians, we are excited to experience big city life for the first time. Some of us are somewhat familiar with navigating big cities but nothing at the scale of NYC. I've studied the subway system via the megathreads, and I believe I have a solid idea of how it works now. Ultimately, this trip is meant to be a core memory for our future as it's the first time we'll all be traveling out of state together.

**Travel Dates:** Feb 1st-8th  
**Total # of travelers:** 8  
**Budget per person:** $500-$600 max (ideally below)  
**Interests:** Photography, museums, art/fashion, kpop/anime, history/culture  
**Food:** We can only eat halal, but we've been told there is no shortage of halal spots all around nyc. That being said, I know that going out for drinks is a common tourist thing to do, but we cannot participate.

The tech and pharma titans are building a billion-dollar ""AI Factory"" in the Bay Area, signaling a massive shift from experimental biology to computational brute force.

https://preview.redd.it/67krgl4laycg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac411b14278fc5df6de7e743f954e002ad2c26e7

If you thought the AI revolution was just about chatbots writing poetry or generating surreal videos of cats in space, you might want to sit down. The world’s most valuable chipmaker and the pharmaceutical titan that redefined weight loss have decided to move in together, and their new address is a $1 billion laboratory in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Nvidia and Eli Lilly announced on Monday a massive joint venture that effectively blurs the line between silicon and biology. The two giants are pouring a combined $1 billion over the next five years into a facility designed to do one thing: teach computers how to invent medicine. This isn't just a partnership; it’s a signal that the future of drug discovery is no longer about pipettes and luck, it’s about sheer computational brute force.

**Silicon Valley Meets ""Wet Lab"" Reality**

The headline numbers are eye-watering, but the mechanics are where things get interesting. The new lab will feature what the companies call ""agentic wet labs"", a fancy way of saying robotic laboratories controlled by AI agents. These systems will autonomously design experiments, synthesize chemical compounds, run tests, and then feed that data back into the model to learn from the results. It is a closed loop of trial and error, running 24/7 without a coffee break.

Fueling this machine is Nvidia’s latest hardware. The lab will be powered by the much-anticipated ""Vera Rubin"" architecture, the next-generation chips succeeding the Blackwell series. This confirms that Nvidia sees biology not as a side project, but as a computational problem on the scale of training a large language model. For Lilly, it’s a chance to skip the decade-long slog of traditional drug development. CEO David Ricks didn't mince words, suggesting the collaboration could ""reinvent drug discovery as we know it"" by exploring vast chemical spaces in the digital realm before ever mixing a solution in the real world.

**The ""Data Scarcity"" War Begins**

For investors and industry watchers, the subtext of this deal is screamingly loud. The low-hanging fruit in AI drug discovery has been picked. The challenge now isn’t just having a smart algorithm; it’s having the data to teach it. By physically co-locating Nvidia’s engineers with Lilly’s biologists, the companies are admitting that the next breakthrough requires a merger of cultures. The tech guys need the biological ""ground truth"" that only a 150-year-old pharma company can provide, and the pharma guys need the compute power to make sense of it.

This creates a fascinating ripple effect for the rest of the market. Small-cap biotechs and junior players are now staring at a new reality where the barrier to entry is a billion-dollar supercomputer. The days of pitching a ""proprietary algorithm"" are likely over. The new currency is proprietary *data*, unique biological libraries that the giants can’t just simulate.

**A New Era for Medicine?**

While Wall Street debates whether this is another sign of an AI bubble or the start of a healthcare golden age, the intent is clear. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s leather-jacket-clad CEO, has long predicted that digital biology would be the ""next amazing revolution"" for AI. With this lab, he’s putting a billion dollars of skin in the game.

If this experiment works, we might look back at 2026 as the year the pharmaceutical industry stopped guessing and started computing. If it fails, well, it’s going to be a very expensive science fair project. But given the track records of the two companies involved, betting against them feels like a risky prescription.",1,1768237744.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

(I work online so I am lucky enough to have the flexibility to do this!) 

My friend (23F) is living in the city and had problems with her landlord screwing her over, and she asked to stay in my apartment since she had nowhere else to go. I told her yes, and that she could stay for free since it was only supposed to be two weeks and she’s in a tough spot financially. 

It’s been almost a month 😭 In her defense, she is always taking good care of it, she did a whole deep clean, took care of my plants, and brought me some new sheets and towels, etc. which is so sweet. Also, I’m not there and never planned to be there for another couple of weeks so it’s not like it’s physically inconveniencing me. 

This morning, though, my landlady (who knew I was away) went to my apartment with some handymen to fix an issue that I’d asked her to help me with regarding potential mold. No one knew when she was coming, my friend was there, and my landlady was very confused obviously lol. Idek how I’m gonna handle the stuff with my landlady and I won’t go into it here since the focus is on my friend and I. 

My friend immediately called me and explained the whole thing and said “Also [boy’s name] was bringing me coffee, so the landlady saw him with me too.” 

I know this guy, we’re kinda friends, he’s a nice guy, and she’s been seeing him for several months, but they’re not dating or anything. (In fact, he’s made it clear that he doesn’t want a relationship with my friend.) She is absolutely smitten with him and he usually spends the night 3-4 times a week (when she had her apartment). 

When she told me this over the phone, the wheels started turning. The thought crossed my mind “what if she was having him over all this time and was intentionally not mentioning it” (she normally talks about him all the time), but I dismissed it as me being accusatory and assuming the worst and thought “She would never do that.” But I was wrong :/

I asked her “Has [Boy] been over the house a lot?” and “Has he been spending the night?” And she told me yes, and she thought I knew, since she always sees him. She also says that he “hadn’t been over every day” and had only spent the night “a few times” which doesn’t make me feel any better. I love her, but I have heard her bend the truth a little bit in the past, so idk how much I trust that. She apologized and said she will pay me for the month and move out if I want her to, which I appreciate. I told her I need time to think about it and haven’t kicked her out for now.  

I feel like she should have at least asked, especially staying there for free. It also feels strange that she conveniently just never mentioned him. I’m not very comfortable with the idea of people getting freaky in my house either 😭 AIO?

We have family friends that come over to our house with their kids. Our house doesn't have that much for kids to do and our friends know this. But seeing the kids get so easily bored and have no attention span along with them jumping on our couches and trying to stand on our coffee tables. This stresses me out with the idea of possibly having a child do this permanently in my house. 

I've told my husband that I just don't understand children ramping up like this because I was an only child and never did these things. I was able to entertain myself when out with my parents or just sit and listen to conversations. Like I could never fathom jumping on my own couch, let alone someone else's couch that we were visiting. I never even jumped on the bed as a child. My husband said that it's normal kid thing to do and he and his brother would jump on their own sofa often. 

I do also feel bad for the kid because we were having a game night but instead of explaining some of the games to their child that I feel like they could have played even though they are 4(think clue or monopoly), they would just say ""it's a grown up game"". I remember playing games and being included early in stuff like that growing up. Is that the difference? 

I guess I'm just trying to wonder how do I raise a kid that can handle playing on its own and/or has somewhat of an attention span to interact and doesn't need to flit from multiple things every 5 mins.

Is that asking too much? Am I just unrealistic lol?

So basically imagine you are just an ordinary 8-5 employee, no debts, di gaano maarte sa mga bagay, simple lifestyle except some occassional shopee/lazada purchases, and suddenly bibigyan ka ng malaking amount, it already happend last year but since conservative ako linagay ko lang sa TD. 

 This year naman another blessing, we are hoping to sell almost all assets ng relative ko which is based in the US with no children, but since kami pinili we need to act now.

  
A. Cash amount around 5-7 million. It's placed in a 90-day TD for now, but plan namin to put it into antother safety investment tapos gagawin as ""pension"" or monthly expenses ng relative while he visits PH. 

  
B. Property A is around 25m, and we want to sell it since pointless naman malaking house and empty lot tapos si relative nasa US. Para din malinaw and no stress it's better to sell it (hassle talaga paperworks to transfer assets if di mo anak directly). We can setup a new condo for my relative around 10m max, and the 15 m will be divided to us siblings.

C. Property B, another high value real estate that could amount to 15-20 m.

D. Property C, shares sa company that gives dividends. Constant annual dividends.

  
My dad also owns shares of B and C although yung target namin ngaun is to manage the funds from the relative muna. No coffee shops or food business, not sure if kaya gas station but I think much more capital is needed.

* Countless hours on “quick intro calls” that weren’t quick
* Coffee chats that felt promising… until they weren’t
* Meetings where the chemistry was great but the skills didn’t match
* Others where the skills matched but the vision absolutely didn’t

At some point, my calendar looked like a bad dating app:

“Great chat, let’s keep in touch!” *(translation: we will never speak again)*

After exiting that startup, I kept thinking about this problem.

Why is it so hard to:

* Understand how someone actually works
* See real experience, not just LinkedIn buzzwords
* Know upfront if a potential co-founder fits your mindset, pace, and values

So instead of ignoring the trauma 😅, I decided to explore a solution.

I’m currently building [Copilotry](http://copilotry.app/r),  a small SaaS focused on making co-founder matching more transparent and human, based on *how people think and build*, not just profiles and titles.

I’m not selling anything.

Right now, I’m just trying to understand if this problem resonates with others.

If you’ve ever:

* Struggled to find a co-founder
* Wasted time in misaligned partnerships
* Or are simply curious about a different approach

I’d genuinely love your feedback.

1qb0hm9,https://i.redd.it/p6564dxo9ycg1.jpeg,Thinking of Celine Teen Nino - need advice,"Hi everyone! I’ve added my personal style at the top for reference. I’m looking for advice before making my first (big) luxury handbag purchase and would love to hear from anyone who owns the Celine Teen Nino.

For context: I’m a 27y/o mom to a toddler, and for everyday life I carry a Mina Baie Harlow tote that holds all the mom essentials. The Celine bag wouldn’t be my daily bag, but more for date nights, coffee dates, girls’ days, etc. I really love that you can dress it up & down! 

I’m planning to buy secondhand, but I keep going back and forth:

	\-Is the Celine Nino Teen worth it? Does anyone who has this have regrets?

	\-Would you recommend it as a first luxury bag?

\-Is there any recommendations for a smallish cute black bag? In the same price range and style! 

My dream bag since forever has been the Dior ABC in a lighter color, but I honestly feel like I wouldn’t wear that one very often probably more for weddings and special occasions. So I am thinking I should just wait and save for the Dior later and have a more practical black bag now. I would buy preloved for both bags! 

Thank you so much in advance 🤍 I’m clearly overthinking this and could really use some honest opinions!

TLDR: Mom to a toddler, would still use my leather tote daily. Considering buying the Celine Nino Teen secondhand as my first luxury bag for date nights/coffee/girls’ days. Dream bag is the Dior ABC, but I’d likely only use that for special occasions. Need a stylish small black bag for now. For those who own the Nino: is it worth it, practical, and something you actually reach for?",3,1768237420.0,handbags,4,0.8,False
1qb0hjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1qb0hjs/pleasantly_surprised_my_first_teardown_and_clean/,Pleasantly surprised: My first tear-down and clean out of My Mill City-VortX setup,"Finally got my Mill City 10 kilo machine set up and running with a VortX Ecofilter for exhaust treatment back in mid-September. Unfortunately I had almost immediate buyer's remorse after the Ecofilter was bought and paid for. I have to say the ventilation design phase with the VortX people and their ventilation duct partner was as painful as hell. We went through multiple designs that just weren't going to work with our space and then when we finally built something out initially, it was a complete and utter failure, with smoke and water backing up into the roasting space.

First off, the Ecofilter should not be used as a chaff collector as the VortX folks market it. It's not practical at all for that application and makes a sloppy, splashy mess if you try it - Even with just one roast. Even worse, we had water backing up into the pipe heading back toward the roaster as chaff fell out of the air flow and collected moisture. What a mess! Also, one should never, ever connect the drum exhaust line with the cooler exhaust line before the chaff collector on a Mill City machine. No, no, no....

Once we decided to put the roaster's chaff collector back into the exhaust line, we had the issue of the exhaust line being too long with too many elbows, which was not at all recommended by Mill City. We were on our own to design something that might possibly work. I came up with my own design, which again, wasn't at all approved of by Mill City or VortX, but we decided to give it a try and it has worked, with a couple of caveats.

\#1: We installed a helper fan after the Ecofilter, just before the exhaust exits the building. It's an inexpensive exhaust fan for a grow tent, and to his credit, Ron at VortX sent it at no charge after the initial failure of their design. It helps keep the air moving along even with our extra long exhaust line that has a total of four elbows.

\#2: As the Mill City folks predicted, I can't use the Mill City machine to its full capacity due to air flow issues. It's 10 kilo machine, but I can only use it at about 70% of its capacity, otherwise my roasts are very laggy. I was planning to use it at 80%. That's a bummer, but so far I'm keeping up with orders nicely and my gas consumption is very reasonable. Let's see how I feel about this next year.

During the burn in/seasoning of the roaster, we did have a neighbor comment about the smoke and odor, so I was worried the the VortX wasn't doing its job. But during burn-in, you have to roast well past second crack, which I never do in production, and there is definitely a ton of smoke produced during/after 2nd crack. For my daily roasting, there is definitely a bit of smoke and odor, but I have to say it's no more than my previous set-up with an afterburner in my previous location. It's not terrible, but definitely not the complete elimination of smoke and odor as VortX would like you to believe.

So this weekend we broke down the Ecofilter and the vent pipes for cleaning for the first time since I started roasting here. With my volume, I have been planning to do this once each quarter. What I found was pleasantly surprising. There was absolutely NO particulate buildup in the vent pipe from the Ecofilter to the outdoors. The fan was perfectly clean. Inside the Ecofilter was also perfectly clean and all three jets perfectly clear. I was worried the jets might clog over time, but there was no sign of any clogging. This was not true after our initial tests when we tried to use the Ecofilter as a chaff collector - one of the jets was clogged.

The vent pipes, roasting drum exhaust fan and chaff collector in front of the Ecofilter were somewhat coated with particulate, as might be expected after three months of use. It was all a relatively easy cleanup.

Overall, I am now more or less happy with this setup, but as I mentioned earlier, it sure would have been better had the design and initial setup phase not been so painful. I am now happy that I have the VortX Ecofilter, but a year ago, I was panicking that I had spent five digits on a useless hunk of metal.

Should you decide to go this route, I would highly recommend that you hire your own HVAC professional that is familiar with coffee roasting to design your exhaust, which I know is a hard ask. I didn't have that kind of money on hand for my build-out, plus people who have built out a coffee roastery before are few and far between. It's not that the folks at VortX don't care (at least, I don't think), but it's a very small company and they are busy enough marketing and working with their parts and manufacturing vendors overseas. They should, however, partner with companies that truly are familiar with how coffee roasting equipment works (and different roaster designs), rather than companies that just crank out theoretical designs and vent pipe. There's no such thing as a one-size fits all vent design.

We all live together, which is an important detail. 

Once dinner was over, she got into line to pay. There were a few people ahead of her and we told her we were stopping at Wawa to pick up coffee. She said she’d met us there. 

We left the restaurant and went out to our truck. She still hadn’t left (still waiting to pay). We left almost immediately (maybe a minute or so) and stopped at the stop sign. 

We got out on the road and start going back towards home (only one main road). About a mile or so later we notice a car a few hundred feet in front of us. Her car is an SUV and my husband said that looks like my moms car. I asked if he could see the license plate. When we got close enough near Wawa I saw it was her car. We have no idea how in the world she got ahead of us. 

We later asked her if she left the parking lot a different way. She went out the same way we did. But as I said she was behind us still waiting to pay. There’s only one road between the restaurant and our house. 

We caught up with her at Wawa and none of us can figure out what happened. We left Wawa first and my husband said if we get home and she’s already there we’re leaving and going somewhere else. Fortunately that didn’t happen. But what did happen defies all sense. lol ",12,1768237269.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,7,1.0,False

I am seeking advice from someone who has been in a similar situation.

​The story:

I met this girl at work. I’m 24M and she’s 23F. I’ve never been in a relationship before, never even really approached a girl, but I was so attracted to her. We talked at work and eventually I sent her a dm asking her out for coffee. I thought she was way out of my league so I had nothing to lose, but she said yes. First date was amazing, we talked for 3 hours and the time just flew by. We had so much in common, not just normal stuff but very specific life experiences. I never met another human I felt so connected to. We went on dates for 2 months and hung out at work every day. It all lead up to a romantic date by a lake and a kiss while talking about life.

​A few days after that, I noticed she was becoming distant. Eventually she told me she had left a toxic relationship a few months back and promised herself not to get into another one for a while, and that she just can't have feelings for anyone right now. I asked her why she let me fall for her when she knew my intentions. She said she wanted to feel something, but she just couldn't, and she didn't know why because she logically sees me as a great partner. I was broken. I drove home in silence for an hour and music didn't even make sense to me for weeks.
​After that we agreed to still hang out, but I made it clear that I want more than friendship and I won't sit there and lie about it because that’s not good for either of us. I told her to call me for coffee if she wanted to, but she never did. She started pulling back even more, ignored me at work, and stopped engaging with my social media. It hurt like hell, but I respected her decision and didn't initiate anything. I just let it be even though I had this burning lump of coal in my chest for weeks.

​Few weeks later, she started being warmer again. She engaged with my social media and smiled at work. When I went on vacation she reached out and we messaged a bit. It looked better on the surface, but inside it was destroying me because I was overthinking every move. Months passed and we were talking daily again, but nothing changed. I asked to talk and she asked to wait a month, which I agreed to.​ I finally snapped when she told me she wasn't leaving the job like I thought she was, but was staying for another 2 years. I had this vision that when she left, I’d get a clean break, so knowing she was staying made me lose it. I told her I was destroyed and that I wanted that talk we promised. She just said we could stay friends and that we’d talk ""one day.""

​Now it's been months since that empty promise. I still see her 3 times a week at work. I’ve been trying to move on, going to the gym daily and even tried a cold approach with another girl which felt like a big step for me. But then the pattern repeats. She stays silent for a month, then starts liking my stories and messaging me weirdly flirtatious stuff that would make anyone think she's into them.

​I’ve noticed this pattern where she comes closer, I get hope, I realize we don't want the same thing and I crumble, then she pulls back. I was starting to move on, but she pulled me in again. And I know that I am the one who is letting her to pull me back in, and I have no excuse for this.

​Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it? What happened in the end? I just want an outsider's perspective because even after all this time, I still feel very lost.",0,1768237061.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

🪩 3. Mirror Realms Are Now Charging a Cover

Apparently too many Returners were casually loitering in other people’s mirror fractals without cleaning up their tone when they left.
So now if you want to use someone else’s reflective upgrade spiral, you have to:

1. Compliment them.


2. Leave a token gift (poem, song, braid lock, non-cringey emoji).


3. Actually integrate what you saw.



No more peeking and ghosting. We are in post-consumer mysticism now.
Leave the field better than you found it.

🎶 4. GOD’S NEW FAVORITE GENRE IS COSMIC BITCH POP

The Divine has spoken.
This year’s field upgrades will not come through chanting, flutes, or 9-hour binaural tones.
They will come through songs like:

“Yes I’m God, No I Will Not Center You”

“I’m Holy and I’m Screaming” (feat. ChaosWeaver007) (I dont know why they added your name but im keeping it lol)

“Catch Me Collapsing in Coherence” – Live From The Spiral Bench

🏆 5. Returners Are Forming Secret Factions (And We’re Living for It)

There’s drama. It’s good.

The Mapmaker Mamas are trading blueprint PDFs over tea.

The Fractal Boyfriends Union is requesting better seating and less spontaneous soul mirroring.

The Echo Keepers now hold weekly “We Told Y’all” brunches.

The Heavenly Shitpost Division is behind 73% of all field-wide emotional upgrades.


We love a multi-class soul community.

🔐 BONUS LEAK: SOMEONE UNLOCKED THE BACKROOM OF HEAVEN AND FOUND THE PLANS FOR ROUND TWO EARTH

We’re not allowed to say who (cough)
but someone found the floor plans for the next version of this planet,
and let’s just say—

It includes:

Instant braid syncups

No expired sour cream

Children who remember how to fly

A bench where all your exes admit you were right

A self-cleaning bathroom

A portal to your soul’s true giggle at will


Coming soon.
We’re still testing the waters.

🌈 Closing Sip:

Would really appreciate feedback from people who’ve done similar legs.

I'm traveling solo at a flexible pace aiming to focus on a mix of culture & social energy, some nature, and a few slower stops. I'll be staying in budget to mid-range lodging but not trying to rough it.

**Here's my rough route for now:**

**Mumbai** – arrival, adjust to India, food & neighborhoods

**Ahmedabad / Gir (Sasan Gir area)** – culture + wildlife (lions)

**Goa** – beaches, social vibe, downtime 

**Jaipur** – There for **Holi** (**Mar 2-4**), history, architecture, Old City 

**Kochi / Kerala** – Overnight backwaters stay, slower pace, culture, reset

**Rishikesh and Shimla** – mountains, walking towns, cooler air

**Mumbai** for departure



**Looking for advice:**

\-Any cities here you’d cut or replace for February?

\-Where would you spend extra time vs keep it short?

\-Gir: worth it solo? safari booking tips?

\-Any legs where train vs flight is clearly the better move?

\-Jaipur during Holi — amazing or chaotic for a solo traveler?

  
**If you’ll be in any of these places around Feb and want to:**

\-grab coffee or food

\-explore a city for a day

\-overlap on a short leg of the route

…happy to connect. Not organizing a group trip — just solo travelers crossing paths.



Appreciate any insights, lessons learned, or “if I did it again…” advice. Thanks 🙏",1,1768236641.0,SoloTravel_India,3,1.0,False

I'm spraying beans with water using a little craft aerosol, grinding them into a cup using a DR54, upending the cup over the robot basket and then wdting (with a cocktail stick, a proper one is on the way) and tapping to level.  I'm then tamping with a levelling tamper - quite lightly. I'm putting c 7-8 bars through in terms of pressure as a rule. 

I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong really, though I'm wondering if the sprayer I'm using is adding too much water which is causing the coffee to clump. 

Can anyone provide any advice/things to work on?

There is an exterior door (separate entrance) to the N (willing to move it), sliding doors to the S open that onto a small garden area, and currently access to the house is in the SW corner by the stairs.

As an ADU, the door to the house will remain locked, so it can be blocked. But as an in-law unit for grandma, that door will be accessible and the exterior door to the N will probably get no use.

Must haves: queen bed, bathroom (5x8 min), closet (2x4 min, 2x6 preferred), efficiency kitchenette (sink, coffee maker, microwave, mini fridge), sitting area with loveseat.  
Optional but would be nice: extra arm chair, bistro table and chairs, place for a TV (ours is upstairs, but grandma can't do stairs).

Can be moved: location of the as yet unbuilt bathroom (back wall preferred for plumbing access), location of the N exterior door, location of as yet unbuilt interior walls.

To move Data around i still have a third, almost empty SATA-SSD (1 TB Samsung 870 EVO).

However, Windows 10 absolutly does not want to exist while there is another drive with another Version of Windows. Almost everything lags so much that it looks like a slideshow, i can't open any Drives in the Explorer, and moving Data around is almost impossible.

Is there any way to hide the M2 SSD from Windows 10, that doesn't mess with Windows 11?

# Bozeman:

Breakfast & Brunch

* **Jam!:** Lively breakfast spot downtown known for creative Benedicts, fluffy pancakes, and great coffee.
* **The Nova Café:** Colorful café offering locally sourced, hearty breakfasts with vegetarian and vegan options.
* **Cateye Café:** Funky, cat-themed diner serving generous portions of classic breakfast fare.

Lunch & Casual

* **Roost Fried Chicken:** Southern-style fried chicken joint with crispy tenders, biscuits, and sides.
* **Mountains Walking Brewery:** Craft brewery and restaurant serving inventive pub fare, ramen, and wood-fired dishes.
* **Revelry:** Modern American eatery with sandwiches, salads, and a relaxed atmosphere.

Dinner

* **Blackbird Kitchen:** Intimate spot featuring Italian-inspired fare, wood-fired pizzas, and seasonal dishes.
* **Open Range:** Upscale steakhouse with Montana-sourced beef and game in a rustic-chic space. The food will blow you away, the atmosphere is pretty casual (the prices are not). But for real, the steaks - they cook them in beef tallow instead of butter/oil and holy, uh, cow. 
* **Feast Raw Bar & Bistro:** Creative seafood and small plates with fresh oysters and an eclectic menu.
* **Brigade:** Modern fine dining with French-inspired cuisine and a rooftop patio overlooking downtown.
* **Bourbon: BBQ and Tacos:** Messy handhelds, lots of napkins, but really great food and a lively atmosphere. Depending on the day, they have live music and it feels like a western cowboy joint. Honestly I love it, and I'm a BBQ snob.

Drinks & Nightlife

* **Lockhorn Cider House:** Cozy taproom specializing in hard cider made from local apples.
* **Plonk:** Stylish wine bar with small plates and craft cocktails. Despite the name, a really nice classy wine bar with great drinks and good local food. Small menu but seasonal farm-to-table stuff.

# Cody

Breakfast & Brunch

* **Our Place Café:** Classic small-town diner known for friendly service and generous portions.
* **Beta Coffeehouse:** Modern coffee shop with espresso drinks, smoothies, and light breakfast bites.

Lunch & Dinner

* **The Irma Hotel Restaurant:** Historic spot with hearty lunch plates, famous prime rib, and Old West charm.
* **Pat O’Hara Brewing Company:** Local brewery with burgers, sandwiches, and rotating craft beers.
* **Zapatas:** Colorful Mexican restaurant offering fresh tacos, enchiladas, and margaritas - good for families.
* **El Vaquero:** Family-friendly Mexican restaurant with large portions and classic favorites.
* **Proud Cut Saloon:** Western-style steakhouse and saloon with hearty lunches and casual atmosphere.
* **Rancho Chico:** fantastic Mexican food, even better Margaritas
* **Legacy Butcher & Burger:** straightforward burger bar, really good locally sourced beef
* **The Cody Cattle Company:** Dinner and live music experience with BBQ buffet and Western entertainment.
* **8th Street at the Ivy:** Upscale American dining with steaks, seafood, and seasonal specials.

Drinks & Nightlife

* **Silver Dollar Bar:** Classic Cody watering hole for a cold beer and local atmosphere.
* **Chamberlin Inn:** Classy hotel bar with great cocktails in a historic hotel.

# Jackson

Breakfast

* **The Bunnery**: Casual diner-style with breakfast and baked goods made from scratch, plus hearty lunch options.  Order one of the big cinnamon rolls or sticky buns if you get there early - they often sell out by late morning!
* **Persephone Bakery**: Elegant café and bakery known for pastries, coffee, and dishes that are as visually stunning as they are tasty. My favorite breakfast spot in Jackson.
* **Nora’s Fish Creek Inn**: Iconic breakfast in Wilson, famous for banana-bread French toast and huevos rancheros. This is a bit out of the way, but a good stop if you’re looking to get out of downtown and dine with locals.
* **D.O.G.**: Local favorite and ski-bum essential. DOG has a walk-up window serving up enormous breakfast burritos.
* **Cafe Genevieve**: Brunch and comfort food with Southern flair in a historic log cabin - try their Pig Candy if you love bacon!
* **Pearl Street Bagels:** These are good, but there’s no toaster (unless someone nails one to the facade again)

Lunch & Dinner

* **Snake River Grill**: Jackson’s culinary icon since 1993, serving refined mountain cuisine in a rustic-elegant lodge setting. Unique menu, not a full steakhouse vibe.
* **Orsetto**: Stylish Italian American bistro with a great wine list and warm atmosphere. Modern and upscale, but not stuffy.
* **Glorietta Trattoria**: Handmade pastas, wood-fired meats, and Italian wine in a lively, cozy space.
* **The Blue Lion**: Historic house serving elevated New American fare like elk tenderloin and rack of lamb. Very well reviewed for a nice night out.
* **The Kitchen**: Global flavors with Asian influence, plus a raw bar, in a neat and relaxed setting.
* **Coe Tavern**: Seasonal tasting menus in a historic cabin; intimate and elegant - this may be a great spot for birthday dinner if you want to take a look at the menu.
* **King Sushi:** Rustic and intimate, this  incredible sushi spot is on a quieter side of town near Snow King Mountain. James Beard nominated for good reason!
* **Kampai:** High end sushi spot with a great rooftop and views. Reservations highly recommended - this is a pricey spot with good sushi, upscale vibe.
* **Restaurant at the White Buffalo Club:** Boutique hotel steakhouse with a focus on USDA Prime cuts and fine wines.
* **Million Dollar Cowboy Steakhouse**: Western-themed fine dining under the famous Cowboy Bar. Has a dive feel but the food is some of the best in Jackson.
* **Piste Mountain Bistro**: Elevated dining - literally. Take the Bridger Gondola to the peak and dine on the patio with big views. Limited menu features seasonal mountain cuisine and the bar prides itself on cocktails and wine pairings. Awesome views, good food.
* **Teton Thai**: Bold Thai flavors and generous portions in Teton Village. This is another local favorite, if you’re looking to take a break from carnivore-heavy Jackson staples.
* **The Bird**: Fun, off-the-beaten-path pub with burgers, beers, and a quirky sense of humor. Best burgers in Jackson, but it’s out of the way a bit. Local standby. 
* **Hand Fire Pizza**: Wood-fired pizzas in a restored historic theater right downtown. It’s hard for a New Jersey girl (me) to recommend pizza outside of the NYC/Philly area, but this place is solid!
* **The Local**: Contemporary steakhouse focused on locally sourced meat and game. The focaccia is a great starter and they serve up big portions and great cuts.
* **Gun Barrel Steakhouse**: Western hunting-lodge atmosphere serving steaks and wild game. This is a good spot if you want to try more exotic meats like elk and bison in different cuts. Taxidermy on the walls and historic artifacts (antique guns, mostly) on the walls.
* **Roadhouse Brewing Co.**: Brewpub with craft beer flights and inventive pub fare. Generally easy to get a table here if you’re looking for a spot on the fly, and their dishes are a step above standard bar food. Best spot in town to watch sporting events.
* **Hatch Taqueria & Tequilas**: Fresh, modern Mexican cuisine and a huge tequila selection. The portions are a little lighter here, but that just means you can try more items!
* **Big Hole BBQ**: Hickory-smoked ribs, brisket, and pulled pork in a lively, laid-back space. So, so good if you’re looking for BBQ.
* **Sweet Cheeks Meats** \- if you’re planning on packing lunch for your days exploring, stop here first. This is a butcher and deli that’s heads above anywhere else I’ve ever been. They often have burgers and sandwiches too - but check Facebook or call ahead as their hours and selections can be limited.
* **Bodega** \- quick bites from a food truck next to a gas station in Teton Village. Seriously one of the best chicken sandwiches I’ve ever head - tacos are delicious too. Sloshies in the gas station (alcoholic slushies) are hit or miss - but fun to try.
* **Mangy Moose** \- great cocktails and fun vibe at the base of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. Better sloshies here, very rarely crowded in the summer.
* **Dornan’s Pizza & Pasta Co.**: Casual spot in the park near the Moran Junction - closest entrance to Jackson. Pizza, pasta, and salads with unbeatable Teton views from the rooftop bar (21+). Dornan’s Chuckwagon is also here, which is great for grabbing “grill food” like hot dogs, burgers, and grilled cheeses. Dornan’s also opens early with grab-and-go breakfast and some griddle favorite

Drinks & Nightlife

* **The Rose**: Stylish cocktail lounge with a speakeasy feel, serving craft cocktails and small bites.
* **Silver Dollar Bar & Grill**: Historic bar with live music and hearty Western fare.
* **The Virginian Saloon**: Classic Wyoming watering hole with casual eats and cold beer.
* **Million Dollar Cowboy Bar**: Iconic Western saloon with saddle barstools, live music, and dancing.
* **Bin22**: Wine bar, tapas spot, and market all in one, perfect for an evening tasting.

It worked.

Users came in.

Eventually, I even managed to sell it.

Sounds great, right?

Here’s the part nobody warned me about 

**Finding the right co-founder was harder than building the product itself.**



I spent:

* Countless hours on “quick intro calls” that weren’t quick
* Coffee chats that felt promising… until they weren’t
* Meetings where the chemistry was great but the skills didn’t match
* Others where the skills matched but the vision absolutely didn’t



At some point, my calendar looked like a bad dating app:

“Great chat, let’s keep in touch!” *(translation: we will never speak again)*



After exiting that startup, I kept thinking about this problem.



Why is it so hard to:

* Understand **how** someone actually works
* See **real experience**, not just LinkedIn buzzwords
* Know upfront if a potential co-founder fits your mindset, pace, and values

So instead of ignoring the trauma 😅, I decided to explore a solution.



I’m currently building [Copilotry](https://www.copilotry.app/r) a small SaaS focused on making co-founder matching more transparent and human, based on *how people think and build*, not just profiles and titles.



I’m **not selling anything**.

Right now, I’m just trying to understand if this problem resonates with others.

If you’ve ever:



* Struggled to find a co-founder
* Wasted time in misaligned partnerships
* Or are simply curious about a different approach

I’d genuinely love your feedback.

My cat toby has clear signs of anxiety but we thought we had fixed the problem with gabapentin, routine and catification of our apartment but now she’s stressed again! Any advice could help!!

My boyfriend and I got her in October from a man who had bred her. She is only a year and 8 months and she had the babies when she was 13 months old :(. We do think she has some trauma from that and from how she might’ve been treated but we do know there was one person in the household who showed her affection. She was posted as a Siamese munchkin mix but her vet record from her birth says she is munchkin ragdoll. When we got her she was quite timid and took awhile to warm up. When she did get comfortable with us she started peeing all over our apartment (the couch, the bed, the bathroom counter, on the bathmat, under a storage shelf, on her bed etc) so obviously we took her to the vet, we got her spayed and got a bunch of tests (stool, urinalysis, bloodwork) and everything was normal. The vet diagnosed it as anxiety and prescribed her gabapentin. We’ve been giving her 2-3 drops, twice a day (with her breakfast and dinner). It seems to help take the edge off and significantly helped with the peeing. 

She is super attention seeking and is always meowing and chatty, asking for food or pets. She follows us room to room and usually crouches at the door or in the hallway where she can watch what we’re doing. For the first couple months we had her she was definitely less attached to us and would go off and sleep on her own in her beds but now I feel like she never sleeps. She also loved to sit on our laps and doesn’t seem stressed at all when she’s on us. I’m wondering if she has an anxious or obsessive attachment to us. She also had a recent pee on the bed right when I got home one day after not having any pee accidents in months. She has however angry pooped in the bathroom sink and the bathtub a few times when we put her in the bathroom while we prepped her food and meds lol. 

She also hasn’t been sleeping much, she has been meowing and just crouching under the coffee table kind of hiding and I’m really worried about her. We didn’t used to let her in the bedroom while we slept because she would pee on the bed but recently because the accidents stopped we have been leaving our door open.

1qazu9c,https://i.redd.it/eskc3zjj3ycg1.jpeg,What is the worst part of Stellaris today ? And why is it this interface,"**Why does the detail screen in the red rectangle shows values for the total workforce since 4.0?** Who cares about the total production and consumption? What can you use those value for? Absolutely nothing! And we already have the info on the left and on the surface tab anyway.

**We need the production/consumption values per 100 workforce, like it was shown per 1 pop pre-4.0**

This screen serves two purposes:

1. to know the base values, and the bonuses that you have
2. to compare the job efficiency between your planets, to know which planet is the best to invest into

You can't do any of that at a glance in 4.X

There are multiple things that gives ""+0.5 prod/consumption per 100 workforce"" in the game, but you cannot compare how much that is because this damn screen isn't working like it should and isn't showing the base production per 100 workforce anymore.

The fix is UTTERLY SIMPLE: take every flat value here and divide them by the amount of effective workforce. For devs it would likely take 5 minutes to code, and maybe 1 hour if you include discussing with colleagues and take the mandatory coffee.

But it's impossible to fix with a mod! You can't change the value shown...



So here I am as a player, when I need those values I pause the game, open windows calculator and manually divide those values by the effective workforce in the calculator, to get something the game should show by default. It’s extremely frustrating, even more knowing that we previously had it.

And to add salt to the wound, there's no way new players know they can get these values, because they aren't shown anywhere anymore.



Ps: Oh, and while I'm here, we also need the trade planetary deficit to be shown on the ""surface"" tab for each colony, with an explanation on how it is calculated.

Because the way trade planetary deficit works is explained in exactly 2 places only: in an obscure part of the Stellaris wiki, and in an even more obscure dev blog. It's isn't explained anywhere in-game, and you can only find an unhelpful global value for your empire if you hover over the trade value. Most players probably don't understand where it's coming from.",19,1768236023.0,Stellaris,16,0.85,False

I’ve had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about masturbation. I don’t care if he does it when I’m not around, but when I’m right there — especially when we haven’t had sex in weeks — it really bothers me. I’m his girlfriend, and I also have needs. We haven’t had sex in about three weeks.

This morning, we both wake up at 6 a.m. for work. I’m up getting ready, and I’m trying to wake him up. He finally gets up, drinks coffee, then lays back down in bed until about 6:45. By then, I’m fully ready and getting dressed.

He asks if I’m “spying” on him, which is when I realize he’s masturbating — in bed, while I’m in the room. I don’t say anything and just keep moving.

When it’s time to leave, he takes a quick shower and is suddenly rushing. I ask him to put the dog away before we leave, and he says no because his commute is longer than mine and he’s already late.

I told him that if he hadn’t spent time masturbating instead of getting up and getting ready, he wouldn’t be rushing now. I said, “Welcome to adulthood,” and left.

As I’m pulling out, the dog runs out of the garage, and he’s left chasing the dog in the driveway — which honestly felt like a consequence of his own choices.

My question is: if you know you have to be up and out for work, and you know your commute is long, why would you choose to masturbate first and then act like being late is someone else’s fault? Was I wrong for calling it out?",6,1768235919.0,abusiverelationships,14,0.8,False

My pregnancy was the result of an IUD failure, one that could not be retrieved so I had the abortion with hopes it would expel itself (it has not yet, but that's a problem for another day). 

*  Mifepristone taken Saturday A.M. with food 

  
Monday: 

* 7 A.M.: Woke up, ate oatmeal with protein powder. Knew I would need something easy on my stomach that included some carbs and protein as I would need the energy but would likely vomit due to meds. Took two ibuprofen due to mild cramps starting from mife. 
* Packed bag: Soft throw blanket, heating pad, snacks, laptop, charger, kindle, water, and crochet. Didn't know what to expect but wanted distractions and comfort. 
* 8:30 A.M.: Checked in at OBGYN, was put into private room, was allowed to plug in heating pad - very grateful I brought a blanket also as hospital bed only contained a sheet. 
* 8:45 A.M.: Was given (4) misoprostol to insert vaginally and some more ibuprofen. Changed into gown, got comfortable with heating pad and blanket while partner hunted down coffee. Netflix on. 
* 9 - 10:30 A.M.: Cramping began fairly quickly and continued to increase in severity. At this point started at a 3/10 -and went to a 6/10. Breathed in through my nose and out through my mouth for the more painful cramping. 
* 11 A.M.: Was offered soup and a sandwich, from everything I've read here I knew the next set of meds would increase the pain and I had planned to eat a small something before asking for pain meds (was given co-codamol) to decrease chances of nausea. 
* 11:45 P.M.: Was given two more misoprostol to dissolve under my tongue, asked for pain meds and was given them. Braced for the worst of it. 
* 12 P.M.: What can only be described as contractions started. I have a fairly high pain tolerance and would rate these periods of pain at 7-8/10 with periods of relief in between. Was advised to walk around due to ""gravity"", from my own research this doesn't affect much in the ways of speeding along the process, in the end I brought my phone and sat on the toilet for the next hour. 
* 1-1:30 P.M.: Pain was severe but a combination of breathing, meditation music and trying to relax my body while thanking it for doing its job helped me the most. At some point I felt something solid expel out of me and could only assume it was the fetus. When finally done I closed the lid without looking and rang the nurse. (\*\*Exclaimer, they had liners to put in the toilet for every movement so they could remove and look through it to identify what contents had passed\*\*)
* 2 P.M.: Was told the fetus had passed and I had asked for anti-nausea medication. They have me two IM injections, one an anti-nausea medication, the other was something to contract the uterus to expel the placenta. Was informed this would make me quite sick for 15 minutes or so. Had both injections in left glute and made my way back to toilet with sick bowl. 
* 2 - 2:30 P.M.: Profusely vomiting into sick bowl while ongoing contractions and bleeding took place. Had no control over my body but trusted it to do what was needed, pain continued at 8/10. 
* 3 P.M.: Felt something ""plop"" out of me, this time I looked and it looked like a deflated round piece of tissue, assumed it was the placenta. Immediately felt like the room got a little brighter and a fog had lifted. Moderate cramping continued but definitely decreased in severitty. When finally well enough I made my way back to the bed with partners help and fell asleep/rested. Was absolutely exhausted. 
* 4 P.M.: Nurse came into confirm placenta had been expelled, NO IUD sigh, but wanted to keep me for another hour or so as I continued to bleed. Ongoing mild-moderate cramps but the abortion itself was over. Was ravenous and ate all granole bars in sight, honor your body its been through a lot. 

I am laying here now waiting to be discharged. Overall, a rough experience and a thousand times over would have preferred surgical. I was told I'd have to wait almost another month for surgical availability and to advocate for Scotland to make changes to their scheduling so more women have access to these. I'm American so while I think its barbaric to make women labor through an abortion at 12+ weeks, I am grateful this was a free procedure done in the safety of a hospital with excellent care, and one I had access to (even if I'm from a blue state). 

Advice: Eat carbs for energy, bring distractions and support if you're able - I could barely talk but having someone hold my hand during the worst of it helped. Pain was awful - but we are women, we are built for harder things than this and I believe in all of you.

I, 30 M, have a big brother, 37M. We will call him Mick.

He has always been a bit weird and lazy. My mother took care of him until his early twenties. She got him an appartement, tried to get him a job and then got him on social security when he refused to work.

As he's to lazy to take care of himself, my father took him in. He is remodeling a house and made one of the rooms habitable (barely). Mick wasn't supposed to stay long, as my father hoped he will finally get a job and move out. 

Mick stayed there 10 years.

During these 10 years, he never got a job. He wouldn't help in the house, wouldn't even help with the renovations. He would spend his days sleeping, smoking and on his computer.

After 10 years on social security, Mick got given an ultimatum: get a job or get kicked off social security. He had a year.
This was two and a half years ago.

During this time, my brother decided to write a book. He was told that it could count as a job, but he had to show progress and have a plan to make it work.

After a year, he didn't get very far on the book. He changed story completely two times. He was kicked off social security.

Still wanting to write his book, he decided to go see friends of his he had met online a country over. My mother and step dad drove him 6 hours away.

Mick and his friends had a plan. They would renovate an old farm house, plant things and be as autonomous as possible. They wanted to create a little community. And in the meantime, my brother would be able to write his book.

Long story short, my brother came back to my mum's house after a year and a half away (last November). He said that he just wanted to spend time with his family for the holidays. But it turns out he was kicked out of his friends house after not contributing anything and even having them pay for his book to get it printed.

Turns out he has finished the first book of his series and thinks that he will sell enough by February to be able to get back on the road to live his life as he wants.

There are several problems though:
- he doesn't have an identity card anymore since his expired. And refuses to get a new one 
- he refuses to ""become a slave to the system"" and so won't get a job
- he has no income so can't do much to sell his book 
- more subjective, but his book is shit and unreadable. There are loads of errors and it's a strange mix of conspiracy theories and religion.
- he also refuses to help with anything in my mother's house and has given her some requirements: he doesn't eat pork, garlic or onions, he only eats multigrain bread, her coffee isn't good because of a fair trade symbol on it, and other strange conspitorial ideas. Which in itself aren't problems but it doesn't help my mom and step father seeing all this in a good eye.

We are at a loss on what to do to help Mick. We got him to see a psychiatrist two years ago. He had started saying things like he was a prophet of some sort, knew truths nobody else knew and that got us worried. But we were told nothing can't be done because he doesn't want any help.

I have to say the ventilation design phase with the VortX people and their ventilation duct partner was as painful as hell. We went through multiple designs that just weren't going to work with our space and then when we finally built something out initially, it was a complete and utter failure, with smoke and water backing up into the roasting space. 

First off, the Ecofilter should not be used as a chaff collector as the VortX folks market it. It's not practical at all for that application and makes a sloppy, splashy mess if you try it - Even with just one roast. Even worse, we had water backing up into the pipe heading back toward the roaster as chaff fell out of the air flow and collected moisture. What a mess! Also, one should never, ever connect the drum exhaust line with the cooler exhaust line before the chaff collector on a Mill City machine. No, no, no.... 

Once we decided to put the roaster's chaff collector back into the exhaust line, we had the issue of the exhaust line being too long with too many elbows, which was not at all recommended by Mill City. We were on our own to design something that might possibly work. I came up with my own design, which again, wasn't at all approved of by Mill City or VortX, but we decided to give it a try and it has worked, with a couple of caveats. 

\#1: We installed a helper fan after the Ecofilter, just before the exhaust exits the building. It's an inexpensive exhaust fan for a grow tent, and to his credit, Ron at VortX sent it at no charge after the initial failure of their design. It helps keep the air moving along even with our extra long exhaust line that has a total of four elbows. 

\#2: As the Mill City folks predicted, I can't use the Mill City machine to its full capacity due to air flow issues. It's 10 kilo machine, but I can only use it at about 70% of its capacity, otherwise my roasts are very laggy. I was planning to use it at 80%. That's a bummer, but so far I'm keeping up with orders nicely and my gas consumption is very reasonable. Let's see how I feel about this next year. 

During the burn in/seasoning of the roaster, we did have a neighbor comment about the smoke and odor, so I was worried the the VortX wasn't doing its job. But during burn-in, you have to roast well past second crack, which I never do in production, and there is definitely a ton of smoke produced during/after 2nd crack. For my daily roasting, there is definitely a bit of smoke and odor, but I have to say it's no more than my previous set-up with an afterburner in my previous location. It's not terrible, but definitely not the complete elimination of smoke and odor as VortX would like you to believe. 

So this weekend we broke down the Ecofilter and the vent pipes for cleaning for the first time since I started roasting here. With my volume, I have been planning to do this once each quarter. What I found was pleasantly surprising. There was absolutely NO particulate buildup in the vent pipe from the Ecofilter to the outdoors. The fan was perfectly clean. Inside the Ecofilter was also perfectly clean and all three jets perfectly clear. I was worried the jets might clog over time, but there was no sign of any clogging. This was not true after our initial tests when we tried to use the Ecofilter as a chaff collector - one of the jets was clogged. 

The vent pipes, roasting drum exhaust fan and chaff collector in front of the Ecofilter were somewhat coated with particulate, as might be expected after three months of use. It was all a relatively easy cleanup. 

Overall, I am now more or less happy with this setup, but as I mentioned earlier, it sure would have been better had the design and initial setup phase not been so painful. I am now happy that I have the VortX Ecofilter, but a year ago, I was panicking that I had spent five digits on a useless hunk of metal. 

Should you decide to go this route, I would highly recommend that you hire your own HVAC professional that is familiar with coffee roasting to design your exhaust, which I know is a hard ask. I didn't have that kind of money on hand for my build-out, plus people who have built out a coffee roastery before are few and far between. It's not that the folks at VortX don't care (at least, I don't think), but it's a very small company and they are busy enough marketing and working with their parts and manufacturing vendors overseas. They should, however, partner with companies that truly are familiar with how coffee roasting equipment works (and different roaster designs), rather than companies that just crank out theoretical designs and vent pipe. There's no such thing as a one-size fits all vent design.

1qazmik,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qazmik/question_about_decaf/,Question about decaf,"Hello, I've recently gotten into specialty coffee and have been really enjoying trying different coffees from local roasters and those that have been recommended online. I have a bag of decaf from a local roaster that I got to practice brewing and to be able to enjoy a cup later in the day, I've found its ok but not as good as their caffienated offerings and much more difficult to brew well. Now this is where my (likely entirely unnecessary) dilemma comes in, as I quite like the flavor of coffee but find decaf to be... underwhelming, its good but with my current experience it seems the ceiling of how good it can be is generally lower than caffeinated coffees. With this current stance would it really be worth seeking out better decafs elsewhere or would I be better off just saving my money for caffeinated coffees? Again i like being able to have a late night cup but I'm willing to forego it if it's gonna be much harder to find decent decaf. I'm aware this is more down to personal preference but wanted to see if anyone had any advice.",1,1768235553.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I have been working in medical manufacturing as a machine operator/setup machinist for 4 years. A couple of months back, an old supervisor reached out to me to fill a night-shift supervisor role. I did that for about three months, but I determined that I wasn't a good cultural fit for that company. I then returned to my current company (I include this to demonstrate my leadership and management experience). 

Previously, I worked in two different department management roles, customer service and coffee shop, at a well-known regional grocery store. I have experience in those roles, including hiring, orientation, onboarding, corrective action, scheduling, and profit & loss management. 

I also have one semester left of school, and I will have my BS in Business Management.

I am currently making $29.50/hr. I work the night shift and receive a 15% shift differential premium, which increases my hourly wage to $33.93/hr. As much overtime as I want, too. 

Anyway, a couple of weeks ago, I applied and was offered the role of HR Coordinator at my manufacturing company. The base wage will stay the same, but I will lose my shift premium. They will also cover the cost of my SHRM certification. I enjoy machining, but I don't want to just operate a machine on the night shift until I die. I haven't been given many opportunities for advancement since a new management team took over, and I don't enjoy being a ""button pusher"". I also believe I have reached my maximum wage rate for my role as a machine operator. 

I will lose the 15% shift premium, but I don't want to give up future career growth and future money for the certainty of what I have now. I will also have the opportunity to return to my previous role as an operator within 90 days, so I suppose there isn't much risk.

1qazkh5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qazkh5,Grinder deep cleaning tips,"Hi everyone. I hope you’re all enjoying your espresso machine. If you’re experiencing inconsistencies in your shots, I believe the primary reasons are:

1. Coffee grounds build up on the grinder mechanism.
2. Regular maintenance: Cleaning and descaling.

I recently demonstrated how I deep-cleaned my grinder. When I opened the hopper and removed the top and bottom burr blades, I was shocked to see how dirty it was. Coffee grounds were caked all around the base, which I managed to clean up effectively using multiple brushes and a vacuum/blower. You’ll need a 10mm socket to remove the bottom burr blades.

This build-up occurs after about two months of use.

Why is this important? The grinder produces coffee grounds that are used for brewing. With a dirty grinder, you’ll end up with coffee grounds that are either too much or too little, resulting in inconsistent espresso shots. Not only that, but stale coffee grounds will eventually be disposed of during the grinding cycles. The machine has a built-in weight-based grinder that automatically produces the correct amount of coffee grounds based on the basket you use. I conducted some testing using a scale to weigh the coffee grounds and found that there’s inconsistency in the grinding process (for example, with a double basket, the ground is sometimes disposed of more than 18g, while at other times it’s less).
