Her hands played in his hair; her lips found the crook of his neck. Isaiah’s hands found her ass; Gabby ground her pussy on his knee.  
The lone moan that escaped her lips had been enough to warm him on many cold nights.  
It had been enough to break the spell.  
A kiss on the cheek and his hands around her waist as they peeled away from one another. She had walked away without a word, her ass inviting as he could do nothing but watch as she sauntered away. She hadn’t been wearing panties.""

There's something about setting aside just ten minutes every morning to clear my head that makes everything else feel more manageable. But then, vacation happened. 🤦‍♀️

Instead of sticking to my routine, I got swept up in all the excitement—sleeping in, seeing the sights, and indulging in amazing, sometimes chaotic meals that turn your days upside down. Before I knew it, my meditation mat was rolled up gathering dust.

I thought I’d easily pick it back up after I got home, but man, it was way harder than expected. It’s kinda crazy how a break from the norm, even for a week or two, unravels a habit you thought was solid. 

I'm pretty sure it’s the lack of structure on vacation that threw me off. Without my usual triggers and cues—like having my coffee and then meditating—my brain just noped out of it. It's like our habits have GPS and when the destination isn't the usual spot, they throw a fit!

So now, I’m trying to rebuild. Starting small again with just a few minutes of meditation, and trying to be kind to myself. It's a good reminder that habits are like plants; they need attention and, honestly, a bit of patience to grow and get back on track.",2,1748268442.0,habitDecoded,0,1.0,False

1kvv6uf,https://i.redd.it/gaqinea9v43f1.jpeg,My personal ENDGAME! 🥰 Thanks to YO!,"Hi all! 
Finally, i have found my Endgame Machine Rancilio Silvia Pro X in my kitchen, and I’m absolutely obsessed. My wife, on the other hand, has been less than thrilled. Here’s a play-by-play of today’s “supportive spouse” commentary:
	1.	“Why yet another espresso machine?”
Me: “Not yet another—this is literally my second machine ever. My Breville Barista Express Impress has been loyal for five years, but it’s just not the ‘endgame’ I’ve been craving.”
	2.	“Couldn’t that money go toward something more useful?”
Me: “Sure—like drywall, roof shingles, or groceries. But where’s the joy in that? We’re elbow-deep in renovations, living off instant noodles, and I still need my daily shot ritual!”
	3.	“It’s downright ugly compared to what you already have.”
Me: “Okay, maybe it’s not the holy grail of espresso machines, but this beast has some industrial-chic, vibe: unbreakable stainless steel, dual boilers, and all the retro charm. Plus, my old Breville never won any beauty awards either!”

Despite my airtight logic (and a few “test shots” she sneakily sampled), she remained unconvinced—and then she hit me with the real zinger:
4. “Why did you pick this one? Weren’t you set on a different model?”

Truth is, I’ve been dreaming of an E61 brew group machine for ages—Profitec, Bezzera, Lelit… you name it. I pictured a gleaming show-stopper in my kitchen: “Hey there, I take my coffee hobby seriously.” I binged James Hoffmann and Lance Hedrick videos, scoured reviews, and was convinced I’d end up with something shiny and deluxe. Then I stumbled into r/espresso and r/ranciliosilvia, met a bunch of fellow coffee nerds, and learned that “endgame” means different things to different people: some want the looks, others crave features, many demand rock-solid reliability.

Thanks to you all, I realized what I actually want:
	•	A rugged, serviceable machine that i can have fun with.
	•	Something built to last decades of daily use.
	•	A machine with personality—one that doesn’t scream, “I’m just another way too expensive Espresso Maker!”

Last week, an absurdly good deal popped up on a tbh relatively sketchy-looking site. Fueled by caffeine and poor impulse control, I clicked “Buy Now.” Miraculously, the Silvia Pro X arrived unscathed, ready to hum dual-boiler tunes in my kitchen. And here I sit, grinning like a fool, grateful to you amazing internet strangers for guiding me to my “perfect” machine.

TL;DR: I impulsively bought a Silvia Pro X, drove my wife up the wall, but discovered my true espresso “endgame” is rugged reliability, repairability, and a dash of retro charm. ☕️✨",2,1748268305.0,ranciliosilvia,0,1.0,False

And now the heat portion of the cycle does not work. If you hold the button down for 5+ seconds the pump does pump water through, but of course no heat.

The odd thing is when we hold it in for a couple seconds to start the heat cycle the LED lights flash outside lights then inside lights outside lights then inside lights. It does this a few times and then stops.

They’re not wrong.

But they’re not right either.


---

I came to a rest stop three towns south, near the edge of the Blue Coil Rail. People there didn’t know me. Didn’t care. That was good.

I was still bleeding.

My coat was torn, burned down the side. My right hand didn’t close properly, too much strain or heat or both. But I was alive.

I found a place in the corner of a closed diner and sat with a cup of coffee that tasted like rust and charcoal. The fire inside me was still. Not gone, just quiet.

But I wasn’t alone.


---

I first saw it in the reflection of the napkin dispenser.

A shape behind me.

Not a person. Not a shadow.

Just... a suggestion.

Like heat haze off asphalt. Like the ghost of flame on a cold stove. It moved when I moved. But never touched anything. Never made sound.

I blinked. It was gone.

But I felt it again that night.

Watching me.

Breathing with me.


---

It doesn't speak. Not like the fire used to.

It just is.

It waits.

When I tried to sleep, it got closer. I felt it pressing against my thoughts, curling up next to the guilt I keep tucked deep under my ribs.

Every time I started to dream, it pulled me back to the orchard.

To her.

To that voice in the roots.


---

And I keep asking myself the same damn question.

Why?
Why did I become this?

A man of flame.
A conduit of the very thing that took her.

She died screaming in fire.
I survived it.
Was shaped by it.

How does that make any sense?


---

But I remember now. The moment it happened.

I remember turning from her.
Not because I wanted to live.
But because I was afraid to die.

That’s what the fire feeds on.
Not courage.
Not power.

Fear.

It took me because I gave in.
It gave me this—this cursed warmth, this voice in the embers—because I ran.

And now I carry her with me. In smoke. In memory.

And something else carries her too.


---

It’s following me. The thing from Brineford.
Not a person. Not even a spirit.

Just guilt.

Woven with roots.

Fueled by memory.

It doesn’t want to kill me.

It wants me to come back.

To finish the burning.


---

I stayed in that town two more days. Tried to walk away. Took a train west.

It followed me.

Not on the tracks.

In my dreams.

In firelight on windows. In the way candles tremble when I pass.

And sometimes, only sometimes, I swear I still hear her voice beneath it all.

Soft. Faint. Not angry.

Just... waiting.

Is this a fairly standard part I can just order online, even if it doesn't specifically say made for a Coffee Gator. I feel like that's gotta be the case...no? I know machines vary, but I feel like the diameter of the brew head has to be fairly standard, and by default the gasket size should be too? ANY leads would be much appreciated!

The book club actually spun out of the Tulsa Discord server, but the book club itself is still pretty small.

If you've read Blood Meridian, And want to read it again with us, or you're curious to dive in for the first time, we'd love for you to join us! 

Our next discussion will cover chapters 7-12, but if you're new, and want to catch up, we can definitely still talk about chapters 1-6 as well.

It's not about right or wrong answers; it's simply about sharing our thoughts and feelings on the book, and what we've read.

We're aiming for a relaxed, open discussion where everyone feels comfortable sharing their interpretations. It lasted about an hour hour and a half give or take. 

Let me know if you're interested in joining. The first meeting was at Gypsy Coffee House since they're open the latest.

1kvv33k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDatingApps/comments/1kvv33k/i_have_dated_over_40_different_girls_and_need/,I have dated over 40 different girls and need your help:(,"Hey guys, this is going to be a bit of a long post and I want to apologize in advance for any mistakes. I'm not a native speaker. I hope someone here can help me or maybe is in the same situation. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read my post. You guys are truly the best!

I'm male, almost 29, and I've never had a proper relationship in my life. I'm not a virgin anymore – I had my first time at 21. Since then, I've been with a handful of other women, but I was never truly happy with any of it. I’d describe myself as a solid 7.5/10 in terms of looks. I'm average to well-built, have a full head of hair, and a trimmed beard. I have a well-paying job, my own apartment, and a completed master’s degree from a reputable university. It’s hard not to sound arrogant when saying this, but I wouldn’t say I’m a bad catch. I'm honest, talkative, and I understand humor. I’d say I’m a very empathetic person and considerate toward others.

One of the reasons I never had a relationship was the constant moving around. I only really managed to settle in one city at age 20 when I started studying. Since then, I’ve met over 40 different women through all sorts of online dating apps – Tinder, Bumble, LOVOO, and more recently, Hinge. They were usually around 3 to 4 years younger than me, sometimes just a year. I never met older women. I’ve never asked a woman out in real life because I always assume they’re already taken or simply wouldn’t be interested, and I don’t want to get rejected for no reason.

My experiences with women from dating apps have been catastrophic. Often, I didn’t find many of them attractive because they didn’t look like their pictures. There was usually just one date and then I forgot about them. With some, it was just about having fun, which sometimes turned into a weeks- or months-long ""friends with benefits"" situation. I ended the last FWB situation in January after 10 weeks because I realized I wasn’t getting anywhere. I wouldn’t say I have too high standards when it comes to looks. I just don’t feel attracted to certain facial features – I prefer soft, feminine traits. Many women here (I live in Germany) look quite masculine and have a sturdier body type. That’s not meant to be offensive at all – I’m just more into a sporty or normal build, and I don’t feel sexually attracted to women who are overweight.

I also see many guys in relationships who, in my opinion, have a lot of physical flaws and are still with very attractive women. I don’t think I only go for the “top tier” women. In terms of looks, I always stay within my own league. But it’s not just about appearances – many women I've met just didn’t interest me personality-wise. I found German women to be very shallow and, honestly, a bit rough in their overall demeanor – not very feminine. I'm originally from Southern Europe but grew up here.

By now, I’m extremely frustrated because I can’t find a suitable partner. I didn’t meet anyone during my bachelor’s degree because it was mostly guys, and the few women there either weren’t my type or already taken. My master’s program was completely online due to COVID. I didn’t meet a single person through that. I have a few friends, but they’re just as unlucky in dating as I am, some even older. Last year, I went out more with them, but nothing ever came of it. At work, there’s simply no one my age. A new colleague is a year younger, but she already has a boyfriend. My family can’t help me meet anyone either – they don’t have any social circle here. They also don’t know any single women from our culture in my age group.

At the beginning, I mentioned I downloaded Hinge in early March. As of today, I’ve only had 45 matches and met just 4 women in person. Most stop replying after just a few messages. I only met three of them once, and one I met three times. All four were just a complete disaster for me.

The first one (only met her once) went on a 3.5-hour walk with me. I bought her a coffee, asked for her number in front of her apartment, and she saved herself in my phone using her full name. She asked me to call her so she could save my number too. That same evening, I texted her saying I enjoyed the date – she replied the same thing. I asked what she and her friend did later that day, and she just ghosted me and never replied.

The next two didn’t look anything like their pictures – I met them only once. Both were at least 10 kg heavier and looked a lot older. I don’t understand why some women upload outdated pictures on dating apps. My photos are all recent and show both my face and build.

The last one was by far the worst. First date: 3-hour walk. Second date: we went to the cinema and ended up making out on a park bench for over an hour, then walked through the whole city holding hands. The third date was a disaster. It happened a week after the second date – she had been visiting her parents outside the city. We went bowling, I picked her up, we had dinner, then walked for 30 minutes. She had to leave, and as I was driving her home, she said just before getting out that she wasn’t really feeling the vibe anymore. And she realized this only at the end of the date? She acted completely different than at the second date – even the greeting kiss was fast and emotionless.

Another one I met before these four from Tinder – we went on 7 dates. We did everything: restaurants, cinema, bars, lakeside hangouts, etc. By the end of the sixth date, I asked her why she was so distant. We hadn’t even kissed or held hands, though each date lasted over 5 hours. In the cinema, I put my arm around her shoulder, and at the lake, she sat between my legs while I gave her a massage, kissed her temple and neck. She said she needs time for physical contact, which I understood. I told her she didn’t have to come to my place if she wasn’t comfortable (we had planned to grab drinks and play games at my place for the sixth date), and she still came over. Nothing happened. She just sat there playing PlayStation and talking. I even asked if she wanted to watch a movie, and she said gaming was fine. She gave me a small birthday gift that day too. After the sixth date, I mentally checked out. I canceled the seventh date once, and she asked to reschedule. Stupid me agreed. We went bowling, and again – nothing happened. I just texted her if she got home safely and wished her good night. She replied with a good night, and I never heard from her again. A month later, she deleted me on WhatsApp, and I removed her on Instagram. I still don’t understand what that was all about or why she wanted to come over, suggest we visit my parents’ restaurant, etc. – all without even kissing.

As you can probably tell, this whole situation is really weighing on me. I just can’t understand how one person can have such unbelievably bad luck.

I’m mentally at my limit and really don’t know how a guy is supposed to find someone in today’s world. My buddies keep telling me to try offline dating because there’s just way too many men online. That makes sense, but the women you see online are the same ones you see offline too. It feels so insanely competitive to find a girlfriend nowadays. The endless abundance for girls is insane - they have always the better cards in their hands and can chose freely. I honestly don’t understand how it’s possible to find a girlfriend in today’s world.",1,1748268050.0,OnlineDatingApps,0,1.0,False

1kvv2kt,https://i.redd.it/s21seaheu43f1.jpeg,Shagaf Vanilla Toffee: Don’t go by the name,"Vanilla Toffee by Swiss Arabian was an unexpected surprise and I have been meaning to write a proper review, just for my own sake. Swiss Arabian is a middle-eastern brand with both designer prices and quality, and Vanilla Toffee is not the gourmand one would expect from the name.

The fragrance opens with a hyper-realistic note of toffee. This is not your generic, sweet milky candy. This is homemade caramel - borderline bitter like someone has turned off the heat right before the caramel started to burn. 

The toffee note then mixes with a beautiful smoky note of coffee - imagine a shot of Turkish coffee in a copper vessel, the aroma unmistakably bitter and rich. As a coffee fan, I rejoiced at the first sniff!

The bitter opening stays longer than I would have liked - nearly 20 minutes. But then steadily, the fragrance transitions into this delicious combination of creamy vanilla, almost-roasted walnuts, dates, and some woodiness that I can only feel but stop short of really detecting. 

The note description mentions milk, but this is no way a lactonic fragrance as such. Creamy like a dessert where milk has been used somewhere in the recipe, but doesn’t play a central role to the overall DNA.

This is a gourmand-esque fragrance - all the qualities (read notes) of a gourmand but it actually isn’t one. It has vanilla, toffee, dates and all the deliciousness of a dessert but still perplexing how far the actual fragrance is from being a gourmand. I LOVE IT.

This is not a beginner-friendly fragrance, slightly difficult to wear on its own. Although I enjoy it as it is - the DNA is a very confident one, and can be layered with other DNAs. I, for one, can’t wait to later this one with both Khamrah Qahwa and Givenchy Reserve Privee - I think the results would be stunning. The easiet layering option is however the Bianco Latte DNA.

there are no items for today in planner.

* add any **non-urgent** items from planner to whiteboard for execution during hidden idle time *(all tasks other than errands can be broken into 'nothing burgers' \[under 15 minutes\] which can easily fit into already-existing but hidden idle time)*

there are no items for today in planner so the board is unchanged from yesterday:

* create alarms for any items from planner that **must be done today**

there are no items for today in planner. 

* review **text** messages while computer is booting up and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) immediately address, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) copy/paste into an email to myself to address in future

no text messages since last evening.

* review **email** messages and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) address immediately, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) snooze/punt to a later date

there were some emails to address but they are all 'business hours' time things, like doctor appointments, bank things, medical bill stuff; none of which can be addressed today bc today is a holiday so i snoozed for tomorrow.

the only other emails are the the one with my chipotle rewards points which i'm going to use for lunch today and an italian restaurant gift card that i'm going to use for dinner.

* review alarms to cleanup from yesterday and confirm today's plan

done and only alarms are to remind me that i might want to visit dad and to remind me to use my gift card at chipotle.

*i want to move some considerations to this step from my emails messages bc this is a better place for daily considerations vs having to snooze multiple things everyday in email.*

* *Balance self vs others/Reddit and Reddit community is 'out there' vs 'in here'*
* *Things tend to work themselves out / clarity*
* *There is usually nothing urgent and I always rise to the occasion*
* *Food in the bowl. Water in the bucket. (AKA food, hygiene and exercise)*
* *Striving toward some theoretical end point*
* *The cost of everything*
* *Universe reshapes itself around my decisions*

\---

* for later recollection of daily activities, create an alarm to log each activity as it is either started or completed
* for later recollection/forgiveness, log 'universe interventions' / 'unexpected occurrences' in 'universe list'

copying from yesterday first...

* busy season
* illness
* son graduation
* waterfront performance
* billiards tournament
* visit friend with cancer
* poor sleep / naps
* managing friendships / check-in text msgs
* daughter college health info / form submission
* scheduling doctor appointment in person
* annual physical incl labs
* daughter graduation + afternoon/evening with friend
* big hike
* \[and still catching up from busy season/illness\]

and adding:

*i also want to add to start my day by reviewing mindfulness considerations and also continue to check-in on mindfulness throughout the day:*

* *How am i breathing? Breathe.*
* *My previous self has my back / permission / memory / idle time carte blanche (""nothing wrong"" and this is great framework anxiety response)*

The place had some unique points that I hope you might recognize. We think it was not far from Forest Park but maybe not??? Was on a side road, not a main road like Skinker. A smallish breakfast-only restaurant but the room was open later for dinner under a different name and different management. Just inside the door, turning left, was a fireplace and beyond that, against the wall, was bar with barstools. Instead of bringing coffee to your table, coffee carafes were left on a table against the back wall and you served yourself. The building was a little strip thing with more than one business and I think the business nextdoor to the right had games like pinball but it wasn't open at breakfast time.

**HOA president started a pressure washing business. Then fined the whole neighborhood for not using it**

 

We live in a quiet-ish suburb, the kind of neighborhood where everyone mows their lawn at 9:00 a.m. sharp on Saturdays, and people wave at you even though they’ve secretly filed a complaint about your garden gnome.

Our Homeowners Association? Oh, they’ve always been a little extra. We’re talking random lawn inspections, citations for ""unapproved garden décor,"" and emails that drip with so much passive-aggression they might as well be written in glitter gel pen. But this time, they outdid themselves. This time, they messed with our roofs.

It began quietly, like most dumb HOA stories do. Every house—every single one—got the same letter in their mailbox. A tidy little envelope containing a $75 fine. The reason? Dirty roofs.

That’s right. Not weeds. Not peeling paint. Not an inflatable Santa still hanging on in July. Just… roofs. Average, slightly weathered rooftops that looked no different than they did last year, or the year before. No bird nests. No moss farms. No ominous black streaks. Just shingles doing their job.

We were all confused. Like, was there a satellite with a grudge flying over our neighborhood? A rogue squirrel with a drone? No explanation was given—just the fine and an aggressive reminder that repeat offenses would result in steeper penalties. Something smelled off.

Then someone remembered something important.

A couple of months earlier, Rick—our ever-so-zealous HOA president—had launched a family business. A pressure washing company, no less. Real homegrown. 

He was suddenly on every neighborhood Facebook page, smiling in his crisp polo, proudly gripping a pressure washer like it was a trophy fish. ""Family-owned, community-trusted,"" the ad read. We rolled our eyes, but didn’t think much of it.

Until now.

Because right after the fines hit, Rick’s company sent out another round of emails. What luck! They were now officially HOA-approved to clean those very same dirty roofs—for a “limited time discount.” Imagine that.

Except here’s the kicker: power washing asphalt roofs? It’s a terrible idea. It blasts off the protective granules and seriously damages the shingles. It’s like cleaning your face with a belt sander. Most roofers warn against it—unless, of course, you own one of the only two companies authorized by the HOA to replace those now-damaged roofs.

And guess who owns one of those two companies?

Rick Jr.

Yep. Dad rakes in the money wrecking roofs. Son swoops in and makes bank fixing them. It was a one-two punch of suburban scheming. It would've made a great plot for a late-night crime doc called Shingles & Shenanigans.

Now, we’re not exactly the revolution-type crowd. We’re more of a passive-aggressive-bake-sale-protest kind of bunch. But this time, something changed. A line was crossed. We organized. Flyers went out. Group chats exploded. Someone even made a meme of Rick’s face photoshopped onto a pressure washer.

The emergency HOA meeting that followed? Legendary. You’d think it was a town hall about outlawing coffee. Every seat filled. Folding chairs brought out. Lawn chairs dragged in from car trunks. People who hadn’t attended a meeting in years were suddenly political activists.

And there, standing at the front like a discount motivational speaker, was Rick. His work shirt pressed, name stitched on the chest, smiling like nothing was wrong.

He started talking about ""curb appeal"" and ""maintaining community value."" Said he was “proud” of the HOA’s proactive steps. He was trying to sell it like we were lucky to have him.

And that’s when it happened.

A woman in the second row stood up—quiet but fierce—and said, loud and clear:

“Rick, if our roofs are so dirty, why does the Google Earth view look cleaner than your business ethics?”

Silence. The kind of silence that sucks the air out of a room. Then, from the back:

“Scammer.”

That was it. The damn burst. People started murmuring, shaking their heads. Someone pulled out a stack of vote cards. We voted right there. Overwhelming majority. Rick was impeached, just like that. Evicted from his throne of HOA nonsense.

Rick Jr.'s roofing company? Stripped of its HOA “preferred” status.

The fines? All canceled. Rescinded. Null and void.

And now, thanks to the storm he kicked up, we have a brand new rule on the books: power washing of roofs is officially banned in our community.

Funny how that works.

See, people in the suburbs may not raise pitchforks at the first sign of injustice. But mess with their roofs? Try to pull a fast one that hits them in the wallet and the home insurance? That’s when you find out just how quickly a neighborhood potluck can turn into a political uprising.

(For context: The school was a creative “university preparing” school where you could live for one or two semesters and get help from teachers to get into universities that offers bachelors in design, architecture, visual communication, and/or art.) Hannah and the two other girls attended last semester with Laura but not this one in spring with me and Laura. When I first met Hannah I didn’t immediately start to crush on her, but I noticed how our humor were quite similar. Later in the evening, after getting some alcohol in my system, we began to hit it off and at one point we sat next to each other and talked for what felt like hours. Laura and other people were in the same room but I only had my attention on Hannah. I don’t remember what we talked about exactly, just that I started thinking, that she was really funny and pretty and that I don’t normally feel this for someone I just met. I started being a little nervous and even started thinking about kissing her but didn’t act upon it. I even asked the two other girls if they knew, if she was into girls, but they weren’t certain and said I should just go for it. But I got even more alcohol in my system and was so drunk that the world was spinning, so even tho I just wanted to continue to talk with her, I knew I had to call it a night. I said goodbye to her and cursed myself for getting that drunk. The next day I didn’t reach out to her ‘cause I was scared that I might have misread the situation…

For some context, I have never been with a woman before. I know that I am pansexual…but I have only ever been with men. I haven’t come out to my parents yet and it’s just been easier being with men so I don’t need to have that talk with them yet. They aren’t exactly “woke” but they aren’t completely right-winged either, so I don’t know what their reaction would be. But there are other members of my family, who have expressed dissatisfaction towards everything woke. One of my cousins said at a dinnerparty that “you can’t be gay in this family” and my sister, who I have come out to, once got on her instagram feed a post about a term for someone who says they are bisexual but actually just are heterosexual. She then showed me the post and said “be honest with yourself”. This hurt me so bad but I didn’t say anything because I was so shocked in that moment. I kind of see where it comes from because I only have been with men and I only talk about men with her, but it still sits with me. 

But before I knew it, days then weeks then months had passed since I met Hannah and at that point I had given up the thought of ever being with her. I was ashamed of how much of a coward I was being, but I didn’t dare take that first step and potentially allowing myself to be rejected, so I opted to not ask at all. About six months after meeting Hannah I met up with Laura, where we talked about the party. She said that I should just have gone for it and didn’t understand why I was being so hesitant. I just went along with it and said, that I didn’t understand it either. 

In April 2025 I was taking architecture classes in preparation for the upcoming entrance exams. One day, Hannah showed up. I didn’t know if it was her immediately because about a year had passed but I later found out it was her. I didn’t get to say hi to her because the classes were quite intense from start to end, and when the class was over, she left rather quickly. We had the classes three times a week, but it took a week and a half before we actually started talking with each other. She didn’t immediately recognize me either, but when we started talking again it was quite pleasant and she was as funny as I remember her. But it was never just the two of us talking with each other, and we didn’t address anything about the party a year prior. Over time I started talking quite well with her and three other girls from the class, and we have made a list of a bunch of things we want to do together. So now I am worried if it’s for the best to just stay as friends. Would it be weird if I asked her out, when we’re sorta in a friend group now? Would it also be weird, if we’re gonna potentially be getting into the same university? I don’t know. I am definitely overthinking this and I don’t even know, if I just have been delusional about our vibe for the past year. 

It is now May 2025, and last time I saw her was yesterday, when we took the final entrance exam to one of the universities. When we said goodbye she said “ I will see you over the summer” in relation to us girls from the class planning to see each other. I took it as, she doesn’t expect us or want to see each other besides that, but I may be reading into it. 

Laura had some time ago told me, that Hannah would probably be open to just have a coffee together and chat, but I am still terrified. My friends tell me I should also go for it and “do it for the plot”, but I wanted the opinion from others to see, if it even would be rational to ask her out after such a long time, when I have had plenty opportunities to do so already. If Hannah also has felt something between us, and have heard from Laura that I like her, she’s probably confused about why I haven’t asked her yet as well. 

Is it too late, and would it be weird, to ask her out now after all this time?

TLDR: I met this girl through a mutual friend a year ago and have been told, she may be into going on a date, but I am still too terrified of asking her. Is it now too late?",1,1748267342.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1

Fr. Logan, the Monsignor at Mary Help of Christians Church on 12th Street in the East Village, was no ordinary priest. He was a mystic — gifted with the rare ability to communicate with angels and spirits. They knew it too, which is why several Guardian Angels approached him with a troubling dilemma.

Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Ava — all Guardians — reported a strange encounter. A portion of their energy had been drained after their human charges came into brief contact with a mysterious man outside morning Mass. The man had greeted each person cheerfully, gave them a light pat on the back or shoulder, and introduced himself as Giacomo.

The moment the contact was made, the angels felt it — a pull, like something siphoning power straight from them. They watched in alarm as Giacomo’s backpack glowed faintly with each interaction, as though it were absorbing the energy and storing it. For what purpose, they didn’t know. He didn’t appear to be an angel or a spirit. From what they could tell, he was human — but one with unnatural abilities.

The Monsignor was troubled. He consulted with members of his congregation, asking if anyone had heard of such a person or had any knowledge of this type of phenomenon. Several parishioners brought up the same name: Julius Q. Bygone.

A neighborhood fixture, Julius was known to possess gifts of his own — mental telepathy, communion with spirits, the ability to wrestle ghosts and walk through dreams. A supernatural sleuth, if there ever was one.

It sounded like exactly the kind of man Monsignor Logan needed.

Julius lived nearby, in a modest studio on East 14th Street. He had a reputation for being eccentric — but in a good way. He had an odd obsession with the color brown: brown suit, brown socks, brown shoes. Always topped off with a fedora, complete with a red feather in the band. He also happened to be a die-hard Grateful Dead fan — though he preferred his tie-dye only if it came in shades of brown (a fact that amused no one more than himself).

The Monsignor found an old copy of The Village Voice, flipping to an ad that read:

JULIUS Q. BYGONE
Supernatural Sleuth of Shadows
Experienced in paranormal phenomena & mystery solving
— Phone number listed below —

Logan called the number. When Julius answered, the Monsignor felt a faint vibration through the phone — subtle, but unmistakable.

He explained the situation briefly. Julius listened, intrigued.

They set the meeting for that afternoon. 2 p.m. At the church.

Chapter 2

Julius Q. Bygone strode into Monsignor Logan’s office like an actor making his entrance onstage. That was just his style.

Monsignor filled him in on the dilemma facing the four guardian angels. Julius listened closely, then asked, “Did they experience any adverse effects from the power drain?”

“No,” the Monsignor replied. “Within a day or two, they recovered completely. They never felt it was enough to put their humans in any real danger.”

“Well, that’s a good sign. Hopefully this Giacomo doesn’t have bad intentions. But we can’t take anything for granted at this point,” Julius said.

“He’s only approached parishioners leaving morning Mass,” Monsignor added. “With your extrasensory perception, you should be able to stake it out tomorrow and, hopefully, pick up his vibe.”

Julius banged his open hand on the desk.
“Outstanding plan!” he shouted, clearly excited by the prospect of meeting the mysterious Giacomo. As he turned to leave, he added with a half-smile, “I’m not an overly pious man, Monsignor, but I’m looking forward to Mass tomorrow.”

⸻

The next morning, Julius took a seat in the last pew near the center aisle, where the parishioners typically exited.

He wasn’t a regular churchgoer, but he followed along—standing, kneeling, and sitting when the others did.

Monsignor delivered an especially moving homily about loving your neighbor—especially your enemies. A subtle message, Julius suspected, meant for Giacomo, in case he was in the congregation.

When Mass ended, the crowd filed out slowly. A few lingered behind to light candles or pray silently.

Then Julius felt it—a faint buzzing in his chest. His senses perked. The buzz grew stronger as he wandered the church, scanning quietly, drawn forward like a divining rod to water. 

And there he was.

A man stood at the front of the church, his hand gently resting on the shoulder of an elderly woman who was kneeling in front of a statue of the Blessed Mother.

Julius noticed it immediately—a subtle glow pulsing from the man’s backpack. A sure sign: a small portion of the woman’s guardian angel’s power was being siphoned away.

Julius believed in being direct. He was also an experienced ghost wrestler. If Giacomo bolted, Julius had no doubt he could subdue him.

But before he could act, Giacomo turned and spotted him. His expression wasn’t guilty or frightened—just a bit bewildered. Then, to Julius’s surprise, he began walking toward him.

“Mr. Bygone,” Giacomo said warmly, extending a hand. “What a coincidence. I was planning to call you when I got home—I saw your ad on Craigslist. You sound like just the man I need.”

Julius shook his hand emphatically, though with a hint of caution. Julius was a man of extremes.

“I’ve got a long story to tell,” Giacomo continued. “A long, interesting story—and I’m quite sure that once you hear it, you’ll be able to help me.”

“My apartment’s about ten blocks from here,” Julius said, straightening his brown tie. “That’s where I conduct all my business. Why don’t we walk over there, and you can tell me your story over a fresh pot of coffee?”

Chapter 3 

Giacomo sat at Julius’s table. Julius placed two coffee mugs down, then reached for the ever-present pot perched on the eternal flame. In Julius Q. Bygone’s apartment, the coffee was always hot, always ready—black as ink and strong enough to raise the dead.

The apartment was a minimalist’s fever dream. A square, bare studio on East 14th Street: a table, a fridge, a couch that doubled as a bed, a dresser, and a large mirror nailed to the wall. Every item was brown. Brown table, brown couch, brown walls, brown fridge. Even the coffee mugs were brown. Julius loved brown like most men loved air or music.

“Milk? Sugar?” Julius offered.

“No thanks,” Giacomo said, gripping the mug. “I take it black.”

“Same here.” Julius nodded with approval. “All right. Let’s start brainstorming your problem.”

Giacomo took a breath, then began.

“It starts in Catania, Sicily. My grandfather Octavio lived at the base of a volcano. A real one. Mount Etna. He built a glass house down there—don’t ask how it didn’t melt or explode. That’s part of the legend. He was born with a tail nub at the base of his spine. Not long, just a bump. But it gave him strength—real strength, supernatural strength.”

Julius leaned in, mug steaming between his hands.

“Living nearby, in the surrounding forest, was a tribe of werewolves. Not the fairy tale kind. These were wild things. They’d raid the villages—steal livestock, break into homes, carry off food and valuables. They left fear in their wake.

“But one day they made a fatal mistake. They tried to raid Octavio’s house.

“They didn’t know what they were dealing with. Octavio wasn’t just strong—he was a fighter. Hand-to-hand, blades, anything. Rumor was he’d been a mercenary in his youth, but he never talked about it.

“His weapon was an axe—an old thing, the blade forged from silver. That blade could tear through werewolf hide like a carving knife through lamb. But the real trick? When he held it at a certain angle, it vibrated. Let out this hum—like a singing bowl crossed with thunder. The sound created a force field. Invisible, but solid. No werewolf could cross it.”

Julius’s eyes narrowed in fascination. “He killed them?”

“A few, yeah. The rest fled back into the forest. Octavio stood his ground and told them, ‘Come back, and I’ll finish the job.’ So they stayed away—ate raccoon and possum to survive. They hated him. But they feared him more.”

Giacomo’s voice dropped to a whisper.

“They cursed him. Or rather, they cursed his youngest grandson—me. Every weekend, when I sleep, they come for me in my dreams. They hunt me, tear at me, beat me bloody. I wake up on Monday drained and trembling. Too weak to live. I just hide until Friday… and then it starts again.”

He paused, wiping sweat from his brow.

“I’ve tried everything, Julius. Therapists. Meds. Spiritualists. Nothing works. But I have a theory. If I can reach my grandfather in the afterlife—if I can find him—I believe he can give me the axe. And with it, I can fight the werewolves in my dreams. End the curse.”

Julius raised an eyebrow. “So you’re stealing angel power… to build a portal?”

Giacomo nodded. “Yeah. Just a little. Not enough to hurt them. But I need energy—holy energy—to open the gate. The backpack charges up when I touch their humans. Just a small draw. Nothing more.”

Julius studied him. He didn’t sense malice in the boy. There was desperation, yes. But no darkness.

“I asked around,” Giacomo added. “They said you’re a dream-walker. A man who can enter the sleep world. I figured if anyone could help, it was you.”

Julius tapped his fingers on the brown table. The story was wild. Preposterous. Which meant it was probably true.

“You may not need a portal,” Julius said finally. “If you come back here at midnight—bring something that belonged to Octavio—I can summon his spirit. Right here. We can speak to him directly.”

Giacomo’s eyes lit up. He reached into his shirt and pulled out a necklace. Hanging from the chain was a single yellowed fang.

“This,” he said, “belonged to my grandfather. A werewolf fang. He pulled it himself from one of the beasts he killed.”

Julius smiled. “That’ll do.”

“I’ll be back at midnight,” Giacomo said, rising. “Thank you, Julius. Really.”

Julius watched him leave. There was hope now. Because this battle wasn’t about strength. Not really. It was a war of the mind—and that just so happened to be Julius Q. Bygone’s favorite kind.

Chapter 4 

It was midnight on Wednesday in Julius’s studio apartment on 14th Street. Giacomo was already seated at the table, anxiously awaiting the spirit of his grandfather. If all went well, the curse would be broken, and he might finally get some rest this weekend. But it wouldn’t be easy.

Julius took the werewolf fang necklace that had once belonged to Octavio and placed it in a ceramic bowl in the center of the table. At the stroke of midnight, he began clapping his hands together rhythmically and chanting in a low, resonant tone. Often, these initial encounters required force—Julius had been known to wrestle a ghost or two into submission—but something told him this one would come more willingly.

From the ceiling, a mist would descended—swirling gray and white like fog lit by moonlight. It spiraled slowly downward, then settled on the floor, taking human shape. A strong, stocky figure emerged: white hair to the shoulders, a thick beard, and the presence of a man who had lived through battle and legend.

Giacomo was overcome with emotion.

“Grandpa Octavio,” he said, rising from his seat.

He didn’t need to ask. He knew. Octavio extended a weathered hand, and they touched—two generations reunited in spirit and blood. Julius stood off to the side, giving the moment its space but keeping the business at hand in focus.

“There’s much to discuss,” Julius said gently, steering the meeting forward.

Giacomo turned to his grandfather.

“Grandfather, I’ve fallen victim to the werewolves’ curse. As revenge for you driving them into the forest, they targeted your youngest grandson—me. Every weekend, they attack me in my dreams. They beat me mercilessly until I wake up Monday morning too scared and weak to function. Then it starts again. Every Friday night.”

Octavio listened closely, his expression a mix of compassion and disappointment. His eyes narrowed with the weight of ancestral expectation.

“I had hoped,” Octavio said, “that my grandson would show more fight.”

“I’m not asking you to fight for me,” Giacomo replied firmly. “I know this is my curse, and my burden. I just ask for the weapon you once wielded—the silver-bladed axe. It’s my inheritance, isn’t it? You used it to defeat the werewolf clan and protect the villagers. I want to use it now to protect myself and finally break the curse.”

Octavio nodded solemnly.

“The axe remains where I left it—by the front door of my glass house at the foot of the volcano. I killed my final foe with it—Fang, their leader. A vicious, capable fighter. His death brought peace to the village and to my soul. But that peace has been disturbed. And now it must be restored.”

“Then Friday night, when I dream,” Giacomo said, his confidence growing, “I’ll return to your house, claim the silver axe, and fight the werewolf tribe the way you did.”

Octavio shook his head slightly.

“This is not about the tribe,” he said. “It’s about me and Fang. My blood and his. Your battle won’t be against them—it will be against Claw, Fang’s grandson and their new leader. Your fight is a duel between heirs. If you survive, the curse ends.”

He turned to Julius.

“The fang in that necklace—it belonged to Fang. Use it. Summon him now, so he can accept the final showdown. His blood against mine.”

Julius, wide-eyed with excitement, gave a theatrical flourish and began clapping again, deeper and slower this time. The energy in the room shifted—heavier now, more primal.

From the floor, a thick black smoke began to rise, and with it came a faint, musky scent of earth, sweat, and something darker. Fang emerged—a towering presence with sharp, angular features and the deep, guttural silence of a warrior returned from the grave. It was the first time he had faced Octavio since the moment that silver blade struck him down.

Talk about uncomfortable, Julius thought.

The two stood across from each other like statues, no words exchanged—just the history of blood, battle, and grudging respect passing between them.

Octavio offered the challenge. Fang, still honorable in death, accepted it with a nod. They couldn’t shake hands, but the meaning was clear.

So it was set.

Friday night, when Giacomo drifted into sleep, he would enter the glass house at the volcano’s base, retrieve the silver axe, and battle Claw to end the blood feud once and for all.

Chapter 5

The next morning, Julius arranged a meeting at the church for 10 a.m. between Monsignor Logan—the mystic priest—and the four guardian angels: Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Eva, whose Heavenly energy had been siphoned by Giacomo.

Julius strode into the church alongside Giacomo. Morning mass was long over, and the pews were mostly empty, the last of the parishioners having returned to work, still warmed by the Monsignor’s elegant homily. Up front, Monsignor Logan sat alone in silent reflection. He smiled as he caught sight of them walking down the aisle.

They exchanged handshakes, and Giacomo came straight to the point. He asked the Monsignor to summon the four angels. He had something to return to them—and as harmless as it may have turned out to be, he admitted he shouldn’t have taken their energy without permission.

Monsignor Logan chuckled softly and suggested, “Confession—Saturday afternoon?” Then he stood with his palms raised skyward in quiet prayer.

A soft shimmer filled the air as the four guardian angels appeared, with Mateo stepping forward as their spokesman.

Giacomo bowed his head, sincerely apologetic. He removed the backpack containing their stolen energy and handed it to Mateo.

“I know the portal is no longer necessary,” he said. “But I would’ve returned this regardless. I made a mistake. I see that now. I’m sorry—and I ask for your forgiveness.”

The angels were visibly moved. Mateo accepted the pack, and they exchanged glances, their expressions softening.

Monsignor Logan smiled warmly. “No need to wait for Saturday. Your confession is heard. Your sins are forgiven.”

Julius stepped forward and shared the events of the night before—what had happened in his apartment, the revelations, the danger ahead. The angels listened intently, concern etched into their radiant faces.

They warned Giacomo against confronting Claw—but understood that sometimes battle could not be avoided. Even the Heavenly Host knew that, as with Saint Michael and Lucifer. They placed their blessings upon him and promised to support him spiritually in the fight to come.

Overwhelmed by their kindness, Giacomo’s eyes welled up with tears. He quickly composed himself.

“A true spiritual warrior,” said Monsignor Logan, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I sensed it when I first met you. I will pray for you. For your victory, for your healing, and for the curse to be broken—that you might return to yourself, whole and at peace in God’s light.”

Giacomo hugged him and gave heartfelt thanks to each of them. Then he and Julius left the church, sunlight breaking through the clouds as they stepped outside.

He felt clean—cleansed by confession, by truth, and by the grace of forgiveness. But he was scared. Claw was a terrifying enemy. The stakes were as high as they could be.

Still, he felt supported. Blessed. He had friends in Julius, in Monsignor Logan, and in the angels. But most importantly, he had seen his grandfather—the man who once defeated Fang and had passed down to him the magic axe.

Maybe history would repeat itself.

Giacomo was ready.

Chapter 6 

Friday morning, Giacomo woke up at 8 a.m. and ran five miles. He wasn’t trying to stay in shape—he was trying to exhaust himself so he could fall asleep early that night. He was anxious to possess his inheritance: the magic silver axe he would use to take down Claw and free himself once and for all.

His heart beat faster—not from the run, but from his nerves.

“Come on,” he said to himself. “You can do this.”

Julius had promised to act as his second. As a Dream Walker, Julius had the rare power to enter the dreams of others.

Giacomo ate light—just one meal around noon. He fried up some chopped beef from the fridge and made himself a small salad with lettuce and red vinegar. That was it. He wanted to stay hungry. He couldn’t wait to fall asleep.

By 10 p.m., he lay down. His eyes were heavy, and he wasn’t fighting it. He rolled onto his side and, within minutes, he was standing next to Julius in Catania, Sicily, at the foot of the volcano.

There it was—his grandfather’s glass house, just as he had imagined.

He turned the doorknob and stepped inside. There, just as promised, was Octavio’s axe—silver-bladed, gleaming. He held it for the first time. It was heavier than he thought, and he needed both hands to lift it.

“Steady,” Julius said. “That’s the one thing these werewolves fear most in the world.”

Giacomo took a deep breath, encouraged.

They stepped outside. It was time.

They walked to the edge of the forest, to a clearing lit by moonlight. Across the way, something rustled in the trees. Claw emerged, towering, snarling, with a second werewolf beside him named Bite.

Behind Giacomo, he could see the angelic glow of Mateo, Romeo, Lucas, and Eva. Their presence felt like the answer to a prayer.

Julius whispered steady encouragement. “You’ve got Octavio’s blood in you.”

Giacomo wasn’t afraid—but he wasn’t overconfident, either. He wasn’t a fighter like Julius, a seasoned ghost-wrestler.

“Remember to summon the shadows, like I taught you,” Julius said.

There was no time left to delay.

Claw was already in the center of the clearing, sniffing blood.

As Giacomo approached, axe in hand, it felt heavier with each step. His legs were shaky. He fought not to let Claw see his fear—which was tipping into panic.

But Claw didn’t need to see it. He could smell it. His confidence grew.

He would avenge his grandfather Fang and free his tribe from the forest’s depths to raid the villagers once more.

They circled each other. Claw beckoned him.

“Drop the axe, and I’ll make this quick. Hold onto it, and it’ll be slow.”

Giacomo considered it. But instead of cowering, he swung the axe at Claw’s head with both hands.

Claw countered fast and hard. His sharp hooves struck Giacomo’s legs, sending him to the ground. Giacomo rolled back to his feet, trying to angle the axe to create Octavio’s forcefield—but it wouldn’t work.

Claw saw the struggle and pressed harder. He pounced, pinning Giacomo to the ground.

Julius shouted encouragement, but it was fading. Giacomo summoned the shadows from the trees—an old trick Julius had taught him. The tendrils wrapped around Claw’s thighs. But Claw was too strong. That move worked on ghosts, not werewolves.

Giacomo began to lose hope. He couldn’t match Claw. The axe felt useless. His limbs trembled. Panic overtook him.

Claw loomed above, laughing—a deep, savage howl.

“How could this be Octavio’s grandson?” he sneered.

Claw raised his clawed arm, ready to strike.

Giacomo went still. The axe was nearby, but why bother? “Just get it over with,” he whispered, resigned.

But then he prayed.

God, please.

Suddenly, Mateo reached beneath his robe and produced Giacomo’s old backpack—the one filled with the Heavenly power he had siphoned from the four guardians. Mateo opened it slightly and tossed it underhand toward Giacomo.

The pack landed beside him, glowing.

Giacomo grabbed it and pressed it to his chest. The light surged into him. He stopped shaking.

Claw, momentarily confused, hesitated.

Giacomo seized the moment. He reached for the axe—now light as a feather—and, with a cry from deep within, struck Claw down. A clean blow, right between the eyes.

Claw collapsed.

Giacomo sat up in bed, gasping.

It was over. The nightmare. The fear.

It had all been in his head.

But he had stood up to it—with prayer, with courage.

And he had won.

⸻

Saturday Morning

He fell back asleep and woke again around 10 a.m. The sun was bright.

For the first time, he felt the world was his again”

He had toast and jogged to Tompkins Square Park.

There was Julius on the handball court, dominating a pair of sixty-year-old brothers—two on one.

When Julius spotted Giacomo, he let the ball drop. “You guys win,” he called.

He walked over. “We’re all proud of you, you know. Especially Octavio. He was there all along. He put the axe back in the glass house after you were done with it. Didn’t think there’d be any more use for it.”

Giacomo smiled and shook his hand. “Thank you. You’re a great second. I had my first good night’s sleep in a year.
I felt lighter, as if the weight of a thousand nightmares had lifted.”

Julius threw an arm around his shoulder.

1kvunop,https://www.reddit.com/r/librandu/comments/1kvunop/what_do_bunt_shettys_derive_their_false_pride_from/,What do Bunt Shettys derive their false pride from?,"Posting this here as the triggered Bunt over at r/ mangalore were quick to remove it (so much for free speech) and lal_saalam got banned :( :(

Can't let a well researched vent go waste.

The rulers of Tulunadu (in coastal Karnataka) were Jains. The Tulu Bunts (Shetty, Rai) were peasant servants of the Jain royalty. The word ""Bunt"" meant servant initially and later also acquired the meaning ""warrior"" as some Bunts also served as soldiers of the Jain royal houses.[0]

Though Bunts like to claim the Jains were Bunts most Jain rulers trace origins to regions outside Tulunadu. With the exception of a few Jain families like the present Dharmasthala Veerendra Heggade family, many Jains from royal backgrounds in Tulunadu consider it an insult to be called a ""Bunt"". The Jains do not intermarry with Bunts.[1]

When Keladi Nayakas of Vijayanagar invaded and subdued the Jain kings of Coastal Karnataka, their Bunt vassals were freed and became powerful. The Bunts and the GSBs became wealthy with flourishing rice trade.[2]

But not all Bunts were wealthy or zamindars. There were few Bunt landlords. Land reforms benefitted landless Bunts as they got land from their landlords. Before land reforms many Bunts were coolies in coffee estates of Coorg and Chikkamagaluru  to Kodava and Gowda landlords. Howevever today every middle class Bunt acts like he was born to a Zamindari family who lost 100s of acres to other castes, being forced to wait tables in Mumbai for a livelihood.[3][4]

The Billava and Mogaveera (toddy tapper and fisherman) castes have a history of serving as bowmen and soldiers in Tulunadu. They have served famous queens such as Rani Chennamma and Abbakka Chowta on record while for Bunts it's mostly unattested claims of a warrior past with not much to show for. Yet peasanr shettys claim to be the ""warrior"" community and look down upon us as mere toddy toppers.[5][6]

Bunts are on a varna scale considered Shudras. There are no historical sources like manuscripts, inscription or any such records supporting fanciful Bunt claims of being Nagavanshi Kshatriyas.

Bunts can feel proud about being a successful business community. Many Bunts have become successful hoteliers in Mumbai and their kids have gone on to make great careers in Bollywood. But using newfound success to rewrite a fake past to put themselves above other communities and looking down upon them is like building a castle out of playing cards. It doesn't take much for an educated Tuluva from a ""low"" caste to blow it. Remember you are also taking reservation as OBC. Be humble.

1kvunlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1kvunlg/not_loosing_weight/,Not loosing weight,"Hi everyone!

Me and my husband started keto about a month ago. We’ve been pretty strict about it and also do a slight fasting. During the weekdays when we work (I have a cup of black coffee in the morning, he doesn’t) for lunch we usually have two hard boiled eggs and then after work if we snack before dinner it’s just a few pork rinds. We eat dinner and this is usually a protein, veggie and salad or two veggies. We also stop eating around 7-8pm. 

For me, it’s been great! I’ve lost around 12 pounds and generally feel better. For him unfortunately he had not lost any weight at all. He’s thinking about quitting because he feels like it doesn’t work for him but we have both been doing the same thing and he’s been more strict than I have to be honest. 

Do you guys have any idea why he may not be able to lose weight? We’re very careful about looking at nutrition facts and making sure we have less than 50g of carbs and sugar everyday. We haven’t gotten any ketosis tests or anything to track, but may start.

Any input is greatly appreciated! TY",0,1748266906.0,keto,15,0.4,False

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.   
I (32M) recently got out of a long-term relationship and started dating again after nearly eight years. I joined a couple of dating apps (gay ones, you can imagine which ones), and about five weeks ago I matched with D (35M). We went on a coffee date at one of the well-known spots in my city (mid-sized, Europe). D lives in the countryside, about a 1.5-hour drive (or 2 hours by train) away.

The date went really well, and we kept in touch. Whenever D was in town, we’d meet, usually for coffee, lunch during my break, or a walk in the park. It just so happened that our meetups always took place during the day. I also travel for work, so I wasn’t always around either.

After about three weeks of chatting daily, D opened up to me and shared that he’d had a kidney transplant. I work in the medical field (not as a doctor), so I asked a couple of respectful questions, thanked him for trusting me, and told him I had noticed a scar when we hooked up once but hadn’t asked out of respect. Later, he mentioned he had a follow up appointment with a specialist in my city. I took a day off work to be there for him, just in case he got bad news. Thankfully, everything was fine, and during the walk back to his car, it really felt like he appreciated my support.

Fast-forward to a few days ago: D is switching jobs and planning to move to my city (which was actually the reason for his first visit). He had a late evening apartment viewing (around 19:30), so I invited him to spend the evening at my place. I suggested we cook dinner, watch a movie, and just enjoy a cozy night together. It was our first actual evening together, and I was really looking forward to it. I bought flowers, picked a recipe, and got everything ready.

When D arrived, I was already in the kitchen. While we were chatting about his day and the apartment, I grabbed a bottle of wine from the fridge to use in the recipe. I poured a small glass for myself to taste and offered him a tiny pour too, explicitly saying there was no pressure to drink, especially given his medical history. He refused, and looked a bit anxious.

Then, while I was still cooking, I asked him to grab something from the fridge. He opened the door and just froze. I asked if something was wrong, and he pointed at a half full bottle of Tanqueray gin inside. I explained it was leftover from an after work gathering over a month ago and hadn’t been touched since. But he seemed increasingly anxious.

He asked if I drink. I said yes, I do drink alcohol occasionally, mostly on social gatherings or when I'm out for dinner, and that sometimes with my friends we attend whisky or spirits tastings. He got very upset. He told me I should have disclosed immediately that I wasn’t sober and accused me of hiding it from him, especially after he opened up about his health journey. I tried to explain that it honestly never came up, and that I’m not by any means an alcoholic. I told him I’d have no problem not drinking when we're together.

He then said he had wanted to move to the city partly to be closer to me. I replied that he shouldn't be making big life decisions for someone he barely got to know.

He left, slammed the door, and texted later that he was staying in a hotel. I called him the next morning, and he said he still needed time to think.

Now, I do understand why alcohol might be a sensitive topic for him, especially given everything he's been through. But at the same time, I feel like if sobriety was a dealbreaker, he could have asked directly about my drinking habits. I wasn’t hiding anything.

I haven’t been in the dating world for a while, so I’m genuinely not sure what’s expected in this case.

I've noticed in the last couple of months that the brew times have extended to 3:15-3:45. The grind size, filters, equipment, recipe and water are largely unchanged. Naturally, the beans are a little different but the change is consistent across different beans. Nonetheless, the coffee is good and I remain happy. If I go coarser to get the old brew time, the coffee tastes a little hollow and sour, suggesting underextraxtion.

My question is, why might this have happened? I'm not worried about it - good coffee is still the outcome so I'm ok with this change - but I'm curious what may have occurred. Any thoughts are welcome. Thanks in advance ",1,1748266786.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

This won’t resolve unless rested for some time. Even standing in a queue or waiting on an order at coffee shop where I’m shifting weight between both feet (despite consciously trying not to I just can’t stand still lol). It sets off this pain. I had this pre op also and was one of main reasons for trying the surgery after physio and steroid injection didn’t help. Just curious if anyone else experiences this in recovery and whether it’s something that eases off in time. I’m worried it could be something else but all other scans were clear before finding the tears etc. I do have mild dysplasia also but my consultant was confident he wouldn’t shave enough away for this to cause any issues. I’ve already worried enough in that area and until I see him again at 4 months I’m just going to seek reassurance outside of that factor if I can :) thanks in advance for any words of encouragement you might have. :) ,1,1748266719.0,HipImpingement,0,1.0,False

He steps out of the machine—a silver dome buzzing with unknown brilliance—and onto a grey sidewalk, cracked and spotted with discarded vape cartridges and coffee cups that claim to be eco-friendly.

He’s wearing a neatly pressed suit, hair slicked back with pomade, shoes shined like black glass. His eyes are wide—not with wonder, but with an ache of confusion.

🇨🇦 This is Canada?

He looks around expecting maple leaves and strong-jawed Mounties, red jackets and friendly nods, clean sidewalks and a sense of order. But instead, he sees:
	•	Homeless tents pitched outside shuttered department stores, their inhabitants hunched, wrapped in synthetic blankets, cradling styrofoam cups more than they do dignity.
	•	Uniformed military buying bulk ramen and expired first-aid kits from a dollar store, where once they were symbols of national pride, now trying to stretch a broken budget.
	•	Children speaking languages he can’t place, not a single ‘eh’ or ‘bonjour’ to ground him. Even signage on the street is trilingual—but none of the tongues feel rooted.
	•	Coffee shop workers named Farid and Mae-Ling, polite but exhausted, serving caffeine to people who barely look up from glowing rectangles.

He turns a corner and sees glass towers—cold, gleaming. Monuments to wealth, standing tall like invaders in a conquered land. Below them, an elderly man mutters to himself, pants sagging, forgotten by both pension and party.

📱 He sees the youth—not working, not creating—but performing.
Making faces for an invisible crowd, contorting themselves into personas with desperate precision. He hears terms like “algorithm,” “influencer,” “brand.” But no one can tell him how the electricity works.

💻 He walks into a university, sits in the back. The students don’t raise hands. They don’t debate ideas. They scroll. Eyes glazed, posture broken. The professor sounds apologetic, cautious not to offend, citing nothing but feelings. No fire. No form.

⸻

He asks himself aloud, trembling:

“Where is the country? Where is the clarity? What is everyone doing?”

A teenager hears him and shrugs, not unkindly.

“You just gotta vibe, man. It’s not that deep.”

⸻

📜 He came from a world that promised flying cars and nuclear peace.
He landed in a place where truth was optional, loyalty was traded for likes, and greatness was a word people say with irony.

And for the first time, he longs not for the future, but the past.
Not because it was perfect—but because people believed it could be better.

Here’s What You Need to Know!,"Decaf coffee often gets a bad rap. Some say it’s not “real” coffee. Others worry about how it’s made. But many people love the smooth, mellow taste without the caffeine jitters. So the big question is: **Is decaf coffee healthy?**

Let’s break it down in plain English—with real facts, expert opinions, and stories from everyday coffee lovers. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear answer—and maybe a new respect for that humble cup of decaf.

 

# ✅ What Is Decaf Coffee, Really?

Decaf coffee is just **regular coffee** with **most of the caffeine removed**. It's not caffeine-free, but it usually has **about 97% less caffeine** than regular coffee.

**How is the caffeine removed?** The beans go through a process (usually using water or natural solvents) before roasting. That’s it—nothing weird, nothing fake.

 

# ❤️ Why Do People Choose Decaf?

We asked people in the **coffee\_kitchen community** and here’s what they said:

**“I love coffee, but it makes me anxious. Decaf gives me the comfort without the crash.”** — Emily S., Seattle

**“I’m pregnant, and my doctor told me to cut back on caffeine. I still wanted my morning routine, so I switched to decaf.”** — Lena K., Toronto

**“I drink regular coffee in the morning, and decaf in the evening. It’s a balance thing.”** — Daniel M., New York

 

# ��So… Is Decaf Coffee Healthy?

**Yes—decaf coffee can be healthy!** Let’s look at the facts in a simple, honest way.

# 1.��It Still Has Antioxidants

Just like regular coffee, **decaf is packed with antioxidants**—those natural compounds that help protect your cells and reduce inflammation. While the decaffeination process removes some antioxidants, plenty still remain in your cup.

**Expert Tip from Dr. Maria Allen, Coffee Researcher, Colombia:**“Decaf coffee retains most of its natural compounds. It's not an empty drink—it still offers health benefits.”

 

# 2. ❤️ It’s Gentle on the Heart

For people with **heart conditions or high blood pressure**, decaf is a smart choice. You get the flavor and comfort of coffee—**without the caffeine that may spike your heart rate**.

**Interview with James Novak, Decaf Coffee Roaster, California:**“A lot of our customers are older adults who switched to decaf for health reasons. They often say they feel better, sleep better, and don’t miss the caffeine at all.”

 

# 3.��It Won’t Ruin Your Sleep

Having trouble sleeping? Try replacing your afternoon or evening cup with decaf.

**User Story:**“I used to stay up till 2 AM because I drank coffee at 5 PM. Now I drink decaf in the evening, and I sleep like a baby.” — Tasha P., London

 

# 4.��It’s Safer for Pregnancy

Doctors often recommend cutting down on caffeine during pregnancy. Decaf is a great alternative that **feels like a treat** without putting you or your baby at risk.

**Quote from Midwife and Health Coach, Sarah Kim:**“Decaf coffee is a wonderful option for expecting mothers. It helps keep routines and cravings in check while staying within safe caffeine limits.”

 

# ��What About the Decaf Process? Is It Safe?

This is where some people get confused or concerned. The truth is:

u Most **modern decaf methods** are completely **safe and regulated**.

u Popular techniques like the **Swiss Water Process** use only water—**no chemicals at all**.

u Even when solvents are used (like ethyl acetate, found in fruits), they are **removed before the coffee reaches your cup**.

 

**Dr. Miguel Ortega, Food Safety Expert, Spain:**“There is no evidence that modern decaf methods are harmful. The trace amounts of any processing agents are well below safety limits.”

 

# ��Real-Life Health Benefits of Decaf Coffee

Let’s keep it real. Decaf coffee is not a “superfood.” But it **does offer gentle health perks**, especially for people who:

ü Are **sensitive to caffeine**

ü Have **heart conditions**

ü Suffer from **insomnia or anxiety**

ü Are **pregnant or breastfeeding**

ü Want to **cut back without quitting coffee completely**

 

And yes—**many regular coffee lovers enjoy both**! Decaf doesn’t have to replace coffee; it can **complement** it.

 

# ��Real Users, Real Reviews

We posted a survey to our audience on social media and Reddit’s coffee community. Here’s what people shared:

# ��“I started drinking decaf after my panic attacks. Now I actually prefer the mellow vibe.” — Rina G., Austin

# ��“I brew my own decaf at home with a French press. Tastes amazing, and I don’t get the caffeine shakes.” — Oscar T., Portland

# ��“I use decaf beans from a local roaster. No weird taste—just smooth coffee.” — Hannah C., Sydney

 

# ⚠️ Who Should Be Careful with Decaf?

Decaf is safe for most people, but here are a few tips:

If you have **acid reflux**, look for **low-acid decaf coffee**.

If you're **allergic to certain solvents**, ask your roaster which decaf method they use.

If you take medications, talk to your doctor about any interactions.

 

# ☕ Pro Tips: How to Pick Healthy Decaf Coffee

Want the best for your body and taste buds? Here’s how:

✅ **Choose Swiss Water or CO₂ Process** decaf — no chemicals involved✅ Look for **organic or small-batch roasts**✅ Avoid sugar-packed flavored instant decaf drinks✅ Brew at home to control strength and ingredients✅ Try cold brew decaf—it’s smoother and lower in acid

 

# ��Final Verdict: Is Decaf Coffee Healthy?

**Yes, decaf coffee is healthy—especially when made with quality beans and safe methods.** It’s a great option for people who want the taste, comfort, and social joy of coffee without the caffeine kick.

Whether you're sensitive to caffeine, managing a health condition, or just want to sleep better at night, **decaf can be part of a healthy lifestyle**.

But as it grew, figuring out the optimal schedule became tricky.

Some compounds enhance each other, some (rarely) compete, others need specific timing—like taking them on an empty stomach or with meals.

It turned into quite a puzzle.

  
So I started reading studies, and eventually built an app to app to automate the scheduling for me.

You just enter your stack, and it generates the optimal schedule based on your:

* **fasting window**
* **meal times**
* **the best timing for each compound**
* **known synergies** – it tries to group compounds that enhance each other
* **potential negative interactions** – it keeps conflicting supplements apart when needed

Then, you can log your intake as you go.

I’ve put hundreds of hours into this, and a few weeks ago I shared it here for the first time.

Honestly, I thought a lot of people would find the idea of building the “perfect supplement schedule” kind of overkill…

But over **3000 of you** downloaded the app, and I received **99% positive feedback**. That genuinely motivated me to keep improving it—so again, **huge thanks**!

# Recent updates based on your suggestions:

✅ **Supplement cycling** (1 day on / 1 day off, 2 weeks on / 1 week off, etc.)  
✅ **Insights page** with logs, adherence rates & streaks  
✅ **Smarter schedule explanations** – understand *why* each supplement is scheduled when it is  
✅ **Dosage customization**: mg, µg, IU, drops, scoops, pills, etc.  
✅ **More compounds** – added a ton of your requests

# Currently working on:

➡️ Add **custom supplements**  
➡️ Better planning around **coffee/tea**  
➡️ Even more scheduling nuance and flexibility  
➡️ **Cost breakdowns** (per dose, per month)

Appreciate all the feedback so far—keep it coming 🙏

If you haven’t tried it yet and you’re into optimization, I think you’ll love it.

The colors are dark, run together, and the pictures are just cheap looking.  I have no expectation that they would bring back any of the old mugs and I don't necessarily want them to. However, it would be great if they just liquidated the series, redesigned it, and launched a better series.  I actually think the newer Walt Disney World Starbucks mug has a pretty good design that could iterate well.  The images on it each look almost like they could be individual stickers or embroidered patches. I could dig it.

It sounds silly but I feel like it took a little piece out of the travel experience for me.  It was a fun ritual to arrive in a place and hit the Starbucks to check out the local mugs and grab a coffee. Now I just don't care and I skip the Starbucks and save a bunch of money, but it feels like something is missing. Pretty sad to see the new mugs when I walk by an airport kiosk.  In general, their seasonal merchandise has been pretty ugly as well.  I hope Starbucks shakes up the design team.

If so does it lead to high blood glucose or responsive hypoglycemia?
If you take most fat out of the diet that leaves more high glycemic food choices that are also low satiety. What strategies do you employ to balance this? Or do you just eat unrestricted fat free ‘healthy’ foods such as whole grains fruit fat free dairy etc in spite of the glycemic impact?
I got off of a diet that leaned keto but was still predominantly whole food plant based. I  eliminated egg yolks, cheese, most dairy (except for 5oz of low fat yogurt and 3oz whole milk in coffee) and meat is limited to max 6oz per day and mostly fish, some chicken and lean beef 1-2/month. I do eat daily avocados nuts flax and chia seeds olive oil legumes soy tempeh and tofu. I’ve lost 10lb and am still hungry. I avoid carb loads without fat fiber and protein because these cause glucose to increase and subsequently trigger hypoglycemia episodes (track with CGM) I’m trying to lower my A1C from 5.5 to 5 so unrestricted and high glycemic food choices seem like a bad idea.
But that leaves me with a catch 22 on days where I’ve hit 12-13g of saturated fat from the above healthy sources but I’m still hungry. I don’t want to lose muscle and am very active. Also don’t want to load up on carbs.",1,1748265960.0,Cholesterol,9,0.6,False
1kvua5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kvua5w/zippy_the_clown_was_at_every_party_when_we_were/,Zippy the Clown was at every party when we were kids but no one ever remembers hiring him…,"Childhood memories are meant to be soft, warm and nostalgic, like sunlight radiating through a dusty window.
But some memories are so traumatic that our brain represses them. Hides them like splinters under the skin, protecting us from the horror, the depravity we witnessed.
My brain did a good job blocking it out for 25 years of my life, but the tweezer in the form of 7 seemingly innocent words, pulled the splinter out.

It was the week before my son Blake’s 6th birthday when he asked me this one, triggering question.

“Can I have a clown at my party?”

That’s when I started remembering him.

Zippy.

He wasn’t like the goofy clowns on TV. No squeaky nose or rainbow wig.
He wore red velvet and old fashioned gloves, with five extra fingers stitched into each one.
His face was pale, like painted porcelain. He had beady black eyes with no white corneas, just a void of darkness. We all assumed he wore contacts.
His mouth was twisted into a gaping smile, not the cute or comical kind, but the deeply unsettling type of smile you’d see on a horror movie creature.

And the worst part?
He didn’t juggle.
Didn’t speak much.
Didn’t ride a unicycle spreading laughter and joy.
He just watched.

He was at every birthday party in Hollaway Ridge back in the late 2000s.
No one ever remembered hiring him or even questioned the party hosts.
No one knew who he was under the makeup or saw him outside of parties. He just seemed to show up.

And now, more than twenty years later, I still remember the way he moved.
Not like a man.
Not even like a puppet.
More like something pretending to understand how bodies work. His elbows bent too far. His knees didn’t always face the right direction.

But no one noticed. They laughed. Took photos. Thought it was an eccentric little gimmick.




I didn’t remember the mirror game until I saw one in a Salvos shop last week.
It wasn’t even the same kind but something about its warped and scratched surface made my lungs seize.

He called it “Who’s Hiding in the Reflection?”

He’d bring us into the dark bathroom one by one.
No adults.
Just him, the candle and the mirror.

He’d whisper:
“Say your name backward. Say it with your real voice. Let your reflection say hello.”

Most kids laughed at the reactions until it was their turns.
I never did.

When I said my name backward; Anay, something changed in the glass.
The candlelight bent sideways.
My reflection smiled, but I didn’t.
She had too many teeth.
Her skin sagged like she’d been wearing it for too long.
And her eyes were black and beady.
They weren’t mine.
They were his.

I faintly remember him muttering something cryptic and ominous under his breath.
“Not the right fit, the other one will do.”




After that party, I stopped having birthdays.
My mum said I asked her to.
I don’t remember doing that.
I only remember the smell of his wet velvet gloves and something hidden behind that evil smile.

But lately, things have been surfacing.
As if they were intentionally swept under the rug and the illusion had just been lifted.

And it wasn’t just me.


---

Last Thursday, I got a message from someone I used to go to school with.

“Hi Yana how are you? Random af question but do you remember Zippy the Clown? My sister saw him. Last week. At her son’s party. He gave her kid a balloon dog, with teeth.”

I wanted to laugh in disbelief.
But then she sent a photo.

The balloon wasn’t latex. It was some waxy, yellowed material.
The shape was wrong.
The dog’s belly was stitched shut with black thread, like something had been inserted and sealed inside.
The eyes were thumbtacks.
The teeth resembled actual teeth. Baby teeth.




I asked my mother if she remembered him.
She froze. Her hand started trembling and she dropped her coffee mug.
The glass shattered and molten liquid ran all over her freshly mopped floorboards.
She seemed unphased by the glass, just frozen in place.

“You weren’t supposed to remember,” she finally spoke, soft and barely audible.

“What did he do?” I asked.
She looked away.
“Your father and I made a choice.”

That sentence changed everything. It was so cryptic but repressed memories started flooding my brain, like a malfunctioning VHS player switching tapes every few seconds.

My body turned to ice.
I didn’t breathe.
Didn’t blink.

“Why didn’t you tell me?”
She swallowed.
“Because he said you’d be safe for now.”




I rummaged through a box in the attic later that night, still in denial.
It was labelled E.B

Inside there was:

A drawing, faded and torn. Two girls holding hands. One smiling. One faceless.

A half melted birthday candle shaped like a number 6.

A velvet glove, too small for an adult hand. Stained with red at the fingertips.

A photograph of me. Only… it wasn’t.
She had my haircut. My dress.
But her face was blurred out, as if her facial features had been erased from the photo.


On the back:
“One to keep. One to wear.”




I found a VHS tape tucked at the bottom of the box.
It was labelled only with the number 6 written in thick, red crayon.
Smeared as if someone had pressed too hard.

I still had an old player in the garage so I brought it into the lounge, closed the blinds and nervously pressed play.

The footage was grainy and some moments were incomprehensible due to static.
Warped and jittery like the tape had been left in the sun too long.

But I recognised the garden.
The sagging clothesline. The half collapsed tent.
And then us.

Two little girls.
Matching dresses.
Identical smiles.
Both blowing out candles together.

The image shook.
Distorted.
Then settled again.

There he was.

Zippy the clown.

He loomed in the background, head tilted, limbs stiff like he’d been hung on strings.
He didn’t move unless he thought no one was watching.
But the camera caught it.
Little twitches.
Head snapping to one side.
Fingers clenching, releasing, clenching again.
Inhuman and unorthodox movements.




Then, without warning, the footage jumped.
An ear piercingly loud static buzz screeched through the speakers.

Now he was in front of the camera.
Close.
Too close.
Filling the frame.

His mask didn’t reflect the light like plastic.
It absorbed it, like old, rotting flesh lacquered with something sickly sweet.

He didn’t speak at first.
He just stared.
His mouth began to move but there was no sound.
Just a low wet clicking noise.
Like teeth grinding behind the paint.

Then the audio warped back into place and he spoke.
Slow. Measured. Childlike, but ominous.

“Yana Weaver.”

I froze.
That was my name after marriage.
I hadn’t even met my husband when that tape was recorded.

“Did you think I forgot?”

He giggled.
High, broken and sinister.
Like a balloon stretching too far before it bursts.

“You were always the tighter fit.”

His disturbing grin grew wider and more unsettling.
A flake of dried red curled off the corner of his lips like peeling wallpaper.

“I liked her better, you know. The other one. Her screams when I was skinning her were like music to my ears.”

He reached toward the lens, and the video glitched, screen bending like heatwaves.
Static bled from the edges.

“But I haven’t forgotten about you. Because things that don’t fit stretch nicer over time.”

Then he leaned in and I could see the depravity behind those pitch black eyes.
His voice dropped to a rasp, an animalistic growl almost.

“I’ll try your flesh on again… soon.”

He turned.
Walked backward, impossibly fluid.
Still staring directly at the camera as his body faded into the background.

“One to keep,” he whispered. “One to wear.”

He blurred into background and the sounds of the birthday party resumed.




I didn’t sleep that night, because what on Earth had just happened.
Surely I was hallucinating. Stress induced I bet.

The house was eerily quiet, almost too quiet.
The air felt heavy and the floorboards creaked a lot more frequently than usual.
I could hear noises in my son’s room down the hall but when I went to check on him, he was fast asleep.

But there, resting on the drawer, was a balloon giraffe.
Its legs were tied in knots.
Its neck hung limp.
Its eyes were marbles: deep red, almost veined.
And inside its stomach, something moved when I touched it.




I confronted my mum again.

“What did you give him?”

She didn’t speak.
Just handed me a letter.

It was old, mildewed and smelled like rust.
There was no stamp.
Just a wax seal pressed in the shape of a hand with an abnormal amount of fingers.

Inside, scrawled hastily in lipstick red ink:

“Every parent chooses.
One to keep.
One to wear.
When they stop fitting, I’ll return for the other.”




I could feel him getting closer.
It wasn’t just traumatic memories and “hallucinations” anymore.
I could feel his presence drawing near.

I don’t sleep anymore.
Not really.

Because the silence in this house isn’t real silence.
It hums.
It vibrates.
It breathes.

The walls groan like lungs stretched too thin.
The air feels thick with something not quite present, but not gone either.

And at night the baby monitor crackles.
Not white noise.
Something closer to a breath.
A wet, wheezing laugh like a dying man choking on his last meal.




This morning, Blake looked at me with eyes too old for his little face.
He smiled wide, wider than humanly possible and said:

“Zippy’s almost inside now.”

I asked what he meant.
He just tilted his head.

And for a split second I swear his skin didn’t fit right.
Like something underneath was stretching it, breaking it in.
His eyes flickered black.
Too long. Too deep.
Too familiar.




I don’t know what Zippy is.
A demon?
A god?
A skinwalker in a velvet circus suit?

Maybe he’s older than those names.
Maybe he’s the reason we invented them.

All I know is that he feeds on forgetfulness.
He grows in the gaps.
In the lies we tell ourselves about what never happened.

And once I remembered...
once the illusion cracks...

You start to feel it.
The seams at the edges of my skin.
The zipper teeth beneath my spine.
The gloved hands slipping into my flesh like a costume.




I wasn’t spared.
I was saved for later.
Savoured like dessert after a rich main course.

And now he’s coming to try me on.

I'm not against technological advancements, as long as they're positive, and I would actually be grateful if other disservices to humanity related to our modern technology were addressed and regulated, so I better not hear comments of hypocrisy over me owning actual necessities to live, work and study.

To start off, I'm an artist. I've gone through being self taught on paper, then doing digital art like a total noob, then proper traditional art studying at an atelier, then a mix of traditional and digital mediums of animation in university.

I greatly value tools that make art more convenient, and mistakes less permanent. I know how fragile paper can be. I love the convenience of mass print, and I adore how accessible reference material is online... The internet and digital means of creating art are amazing.

But I still appreciate the real effort of, y'know, drawing. Actually making stuff.

All AI shills compare me to the hypothetical HS art teacher who told them that digital art isn't ""real art"" a few decades ago, but that's a false false equivalence, and I'm sure it's purposeful. I also met teachers like that as recently as 2015 when I was a teen, because my country is really behind.

Back then, many didn't understand that you still need the same foundation to paint on a computer, and you still go through planning the composition and the thumbnailing stage, drafting and sketching, refining, inking, coloring. You still lay out all of the strokes. You still sketch out your sculpture before you model it in your CAD program of choice.

Digital art means that you cut out the non-creative processes of art. You don't need to transfer and trace on a lightbox. Your ""materials"" are all light fast, you don't go through the same tedium of fixing and archiving them to have longevity, you don't clean messes, you don't work around or redo hours of work over a sneeze, a drop of coffee, or your dog swinging a rope toy at a wet canvas (has happened to me). You never end up running out of clay while sculpting, and you never need to bring out glass color filters or a whole ass mirror to your isle, just to check if your piece has bad values and a wonky character pose.

It means having the colors you need at all times, and being able to non-destructively edit the concepting stage, as to find what your client wants and needs. 

  
You know what AI does? It gets rid of all of the creative processes. Plain and simple.

It doesn't make art more affordable or accessible. It costs HEAPS of money to have that shit running, and it would cost even more if they were obtaining their training data legally. NEWSFLASH, you actually can't put someone else's work in a commercial project without the consent of the owner. And it's their individual choice how they handle their intellectual property.

I don't wanna hear schmucks comparing the human learning process to data scraping. Ai is fed our hard work, it's not an impressionable kid learning and being inspired to pursue transformative means of expression. Your product cannot have existed without our creations, which is a violation of all creative etiquette.

The cost to entry for learning how to draw, is the free pencils at ikea, and a 30 cent notebook. There are people who can do what takes me half a work day, in less than twenty minutes with a blue ballpoint.

The amount of resources that generative AI uses will make you vomit. It's disgusting how much actually gets wasted on it. And chatbots aren't any better. Do you know how many morons are failing university, or fumbling business correspondences, over the fact they couldn't be arsed to actually write an email or an essay? It's pathetic. 

Don't get me started on the people who claim it let's disabled people ""finally have access to making art"". I know literal amputees who paint, fucking better than my abled ass can. 

If they can type a prompt, they can write a poem, or a book, or a script. Don't baby them, and sell them the cheap idea that they can only amount to an activity that boils down to the same skill as a google search. 

There are plenty of universally adored ways of expression yourself and telling a story, that aren't visual. It's close-minded to perceive that as the peak of art, and only serves to show that art was never the goal of that endeavor.

Art is nothing without its human touch. 

And don't misunderstand why the Ludites existed. It was an issue of worker's rights, not of ""omg, weaving machine devil, break it!"". Bloody hell.

Moving for job with partner and two young kids from Brooklyn to Dallas this summer.  

Currently considering University Park and Lakewood. 

We could afford condo in UP or house in Lakewood. 

We are mostly concerned about culture. Does UP look down on people who live in condos and can’t afford mega-mansions? Seems like such a silly thing to say, but we have never even been to Texas. We do love what seems like a more city feel of UP but worried about making friends for our kids without joining the country club culture. 

Our main priorities are public schools, safety, community and walkability would be a huge plus (like the possibility to walk to a coffee shop or bookstore or school etc.  understand it will never be like brooklyn).

Lakewood spooked us a bit looking at the home burglary data. 

Any and all feedback welcome. Thanks.

I've done this before for 278 days last year then fell back into drinking on my birthday in January. Friday my body was drawing a line in the sand and I was shaking and my heart was skipping and cramping whether I drank or didn't drink so I said fuck it and buckled up for the clamminess and seizing/heart skipping for a solid 12 hours. It was hell, every time I took a deep breath my heart would do somersaults and my body would freak out. Basically every 5-10 seconds for nearly 12 hours shit sucked.

But by midnight it had stopped. I've been doing great the past couple days and found some healthy THC infused teas at my local smoke shop that I've been replacing with beers and it's been working wonders. I feel good when I wake up now and I'm looking forward to being sober from booze again.

I wanna propel my health forwards again. I take mens multivitamins and put shilajit in my coffee but I wanna know what supplements have helped y'all. My coworker told me of thiamine, as it helps your body convert food into energy and alcoholics apparently have like next to none of it and your body doesn't replace it for a very long time after you quit drinking. I'm gonna pick up some of that and maybe some mushroom coffee for brain fog and glucosamine condroiden for my joint pain which is likely unrelated to drinking and more related to all the hitchhiking I did during my early years of adulthood.

1kvu3tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessPH/comments/1kvu3tw/on_pasalo/,On Pasalo,"Good evening! I need an advice on assuming a business. For context:

I spotted a Milk tea shop (not a franchise) with complete equipments for milk tea, grinder for coffee, tables and chairs, AC, ref, etc. Literal na complete set up na. For 350k firm, all of these will be passed on to me plus the training needed raw po for making milktea and such. 

From my observation as malapit lang sa store mismo and minsan customer nila, napansin ko medyo mahal sya compared sa malalapit na franchise milktea shops (Big brew, Sugar Baby, etc) and yung offerings ng foods nila parang mahal for a student. 

Now, my questions po are:
1. What are the documents na need kong hanapin sa owner. (Business Manual? Model? Sales projection?,etc.)

2. Is it worth to buy it and assume the business, since it is located sa tapat ng school and barangay and along the highway, traffic is good as well since may 7/11 sa baba ng store. 

3. Is it worth it po ba kahit na 20k per month ang upa sa pwesto? What are the things I should do para ma-meet ko itong monthly due na ito. 

4. Should I introduce another product that would pair well with the drinks?

5. Should I continue with the branding, or should I take the risk to rebrand?

# Training

Utilized Runna's Marathon Training plan.  It's technically my second race with Runna (downloaded the app in December, and ran a half at the beginning of March), but this was my main Spring race.  12 weeks on the Full Marathon plan with most weeks being 65-70km. Four runs per week (two easy, one speed workout, one long run), a flexibility (yoga) session and one body-weight strength session per week as well.  Predicted finish time pre-race was 3:31:00 - 3:42:00.

# Pre-race

Got up two hours before race start, had some coffee, oatmeal, and did some stretching. Arrived at the start about 25 minutes before the first wave went off (I was in the second corral). Dropped off my gear and did 10 minutes of warm up (strides, activations, etc.)

# Race

The weather was just about perfect.  9 degrees C at race start, mostly cloudy.  2nd km was a bit quick as you can see from my splits, but it was all downhill, and I was able to keep a consistent effort. I didn't really feel like I settled in until the 5 or 6 km mark. Fuel was Krono gels every 5 km, with a salt tab every hour.

The sun came out when I was at km 17 and the temperature started to rise.  Not a lot, but it was noticeable. As everyone says, at km 29-30 the race really started. The last 5 km were absolutely brutal.  Lots of self talk to keep going and not walk. I don't have a great recollection of finishing actually; I had tunnel vision and was a bit unsteady on my feet after crossing the finish line. My vision had some changes; it was like someone had pulled up the brightness slider when editing a photo. All the colours were blown out. Sitting for about 10 minutes, and I felt better.

# Post-race

I have only once been this sore, after my first full marathon six years ago. Still very sore today; we will see how the work day goes. Next race is NYC in November.

1kvtufo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeerMethod/comments/1kvtufo/your_cold_hard_truth_the_speer_guide_to_cutting/,Your Cold Hard Truth: The Speer Guide to Cutting Through Dating BS,"Alright, for the Speer Method Reddit group, here's some cold, hard truth distilled from recent discussions. This isn't about whining; it's about winning.

Let's get straight to it. If you're not getting the results you want in dating, the first place to look is in the mirror. Stop clinging to external excuses like your looks or vague notions of ""women playing games."" Your skin, your eyes, whatever perceived flaw you're obsessing over – these are rarely the real barrier. Your insecurity about them, and the weak frame you project as a result, *that's* the problem. Confidence isn't about perfect skin; it's about your internal solidity and how you carry yourself, regardless of superficialities.

Many of you are wasting time and energy on low-interest women. Consistently slow text responses, lack of initiation, or getting ""mad"" when you signal you're moving on? That's not a busy schedule or a ""bad texter."" That's low interest. A woman who's genuinely engaged makes an effort. Don't be her emotional backup option. Recognize those patterns for what they are and cut your losses. You are teaching her she doesn't need to put in effort if you keep chasing.

To cut through the superficial and gauge genuine interest, start using the **4WH tactic**. When engaging with women, especially in early conversations, frame your questions using **What, Where, When, Why, and How**. Instead of dead-end questions, use these prompts to encourage them to open up and reveal more about themselves and their motivations. For example, instead of ""Do you like to travel?"", ask ""What's been one of the most impactful places you've traveled to and why?"" or ""How did you decide to get into \[their hobby\]?"" This forces more than a yes/no answer and gives you real insights into their personality and values. It also shows you're genuinely interested in them as individuals, not just as potential dates.

For first dates, especially with someone you've just met, keep it low-pressure and public. A coffee shop is ideal. If you're asking someone out at their workplace, a polite note with your number is the most respectful approach, putting the choice squarely in their hands without putting them on the spot. Lead the date, yes, but lead responsibly, using the 4WH principles to keep the conversation engaging and flowing naturally.

And this idea that a relationship hinders your personal growth, your career, or your fitness goals? That's a cop-out. A high-value relationship *supports* your mission. If your girlfriend becomes an ""obstacle,"" it's either your own lack of discipline in integrating your priorities, or she's simply not the right partner to align with your ambition. Don't sacrifice your purpose, but also don't use it as an excuse. A man of purpose includes his partner in his journey, he doesn't exclude himself from it.

Finally, when you hear the gut-wrenching ""You're amazing, but not the one,"" understand this: it’s an emotional mismatch, not a flaw in your character. Her feelings are illogical, and your job is not to find a logical explanation. The only way to move on is with **no contact** and a ruthless refocus on yourself. And if an ex who previously dumped you, blamed you, or ghosted you suddenly reappears with apologies and grand gestures, that’s a **hoover**. They’re not changed; they just sense you’re finally free and want to regain control. Protect your peace at all costs.

This is about becoming the kind of man who commands respect, lives with purpose, and attracts genuine connection by first respecting himself and his own time. Your dating success starts and ends with you. Now go act like it.

First of all, I'm a man, I just turned 31. I've had 3 'long' relationships (about 9y in total). And I have been 'dating' in between. I've been having some issues with online dating; most of the time the ghosting - seeming to put a lot of (mental) time and effort in people who don't to the same with me really gives my self worth a big kick in the balls. For context; I might have some unhealthy attachment issues as well as separation anxiety (I'm trying to tackle this with a psychologist).

To put it short; I really have an issue with (in this case) girls who tell me everything about their lives in two weeks, share some photos or even some intimate life stories, we go on a date or two and everything seems to be going well. And then the contact suddenly stops. 

In this particular case: I have been going on two dates with a girl (first one I asked her for coffee, second one I just said when I was free, she said she couldnt but later in the week still wanted to meet up). The contact from then on got a little less (what already confused me). I shot one more shot to see If she still was interested, to go for a drink. She said was busy (and the week after was away for work). 

These two weeks habe now passed and I low key want to ask her out again as a sort of 'last try' - but at this point I'm super scared (to come off as desperate). I'm really in doubt  if I should just take this as a sign that she is not that interested as I thought and try and forget about it (which is obviously pretty hard for me) OR I should just go for it one last time (with the possibility of getting hurt more). 

It might sound like a small problem. But I'm just so confused/ done with people (over)sharing their life and having some fun before checking each others Instagram stories till eternity.

IATA if I do contact, and IATA if I don't. I'm truly perplexed on how to handle this.

I moved back to Canada from the US with my 3 year old son because my husband was killed in combat (Army Ranger), and my immediate family was here.

I started going back to the church I grew up in.  I knew lots of people from when I was younger.  There was a nice group of 10 women, we were all the same age and our kids close in age.  I became active in the church and had a great time.

I've always been private about my personal life, and over time the ladies were getting on me to get to know me better.  We had been doing Bible studies at each other's homes.  Most were apartments, townhouses, I never paid any mind to it, I just liked getting together.  I volunteered to host it at my place for the next 6 months, opening up my home and personal life to everyone.

I am very fortunate to have my own house.  I decorated it to my style, and had lots of cool things as I traveled all over the world for my work.  

It was abundantly clear from the get go that 2 ladies in the group didnt care much for me.  I'd get the up and down look, and they'd thumb their noses, but I didnt care.  There's always going to be someone, no matter where you go.

When the ladies started arriving, I knew they'd be surprised.  On a financial level, yes, I did have more than them, but my life was also different from theirs.  For my career I worked for a major record label as the National Publicist.  I worked 20 hour days, had no personal life, and because I worked so much, I saved my money.  I retired when I had our son and wanted to be a stay at home mom.

I don't choose my friends by what they have or don't have.  Are you kind, reliable, honest?  That's what I look for.  Although these women had known me for years, inviting me into their homes for dinner, birthday parties, bible studies, etc, I was viewed as an outgoing, kind, and fun person to be around... until they came to my house.

6 of 10 didn't care.  The other 4 really cared, especially the original 2 who didnt like me off the bat.  Over the next 6 months not one person brought any goodies for the evening, they bitched about my furniture, complained about why do I serve tea in tea cups, they want mugs, one spat a mouthful of tea back into her cup because I made orange spice and she wanted orange pekoe, they constantly complained about my 2 giant English Mastiffs, that I needed to put them in the laundry room because when they slept in the kitchen they snored.  In their minds I had the money to provide goodies and drinks for 10 people each week.  I knew if I put the dogs up, they would bark and howling to be with us.  They're Mastiffs and clingy.  This also marked the beginning of me not being invited to anyone's house anymore.  When I brought it up in joking fashion, the lady I'm writing about said ""why would be interested in coming to my dump of an apartment?""  I replied with ""like the way I did for 3 years prior?"".  I had a huge wall of platinum and gold CD awards that were presented to me as gifts, marking milestone sales for certain bands, and I'd be asked ""how can you reconcile your Christianity and still have worked for rock and roll bands?""  ""You mean the same level of Christianity in the last 3 years when you ask me to lead and end with prayer?"".  

I got sick and tired of it.  I dreaded Thursday's when they would come over.  The tea, coffee, special juices, and pop orders were bugging me, and the one lady's son would harass my boy constantly.  I told my son the next time he jumps on you, you're free to fight back. Her son punched my kid in the nose so my boy picked him up and threw him. 

Long story short, the lady in question is diagnosed with a rare breast cancer.  Things were already tense, but I did pray for her, called her, made food etc.  She made it through treatment and was fine for many years, until recently.  Its come back with a vengeance and she may have 4 months of life left.  Shortly after the throwing incident, they moved 10 miles away and attended a different church.  I was pissed off at everyone and announced one night it was time for someone else to host.  A few years after this I started going to a different church, and everyone got scattered around.  I rarely kept in touch with one gal, we'd chat maybe once a year.

So my question is...... Should I send the gal with cancer, who doesn't like me a message, or a card?, or  do I just continue praying for her and her family and leave it alone?

A big part of me thinks its the right thing to do to do, but I also dont want to piss her off.  

As I've gotten older I've learned to read the room in tricky situations and to not impose what I necessarily deem as the right thing, but to be wise instead. ",3,1748264203.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1kvtoei,https://i.redd.it/bd6k4882j43f1.jpeg,Why Japanese electric and power tool priorities are different,"This picture has been going around for awhile, but this description is from  Gary Bogle of the ""I take pictures of electronic parts"" FB Group:

""Japan’s unique situation of having two different power frequencies—50Hz in the east and 60Hz in the west—goes back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the country's early electrification. Here’s how it happened:

1. The Origin of the Split

In 1895, Tokyo Electric Light Company (serving eastern Japan) purchased 50Hz generators from the German company AEG.

In 1896, Osaka Electric Lamp Company (serving western Japan) purchased 60Hz generators from the American company General Electric (GE).

These two decisions set the standard for their respective regions—eastern Japan adopted 50Hz, and western Japan adopted 60Hz.

2. Lack of a Unified National Grid

At the time, Japan had no national coordination for power standards. Regional utilities developed independently, and no one anticipated the need for frequency unification.

3. Expansion Without Standardization

As electricity use spread, each region expanded its own system based on its original frequency. Over time, the two systems became deeply entrenched, with Tokyo and much of eastern Honshu on 50Hz, and Osaka, Kyoto, and western Honshu (as well as Kyushu and Shikoku) on 60Hz.

4. Impact of the Split

The difference in frequencies created a ""frequency divide"" at the center of Honshu. Equipment designed for one frequency wouldn’t always work on the other, and power exchange between the two grids is limited and requires special converter stations (e.g., Shin Shinano, Sakuma, Higashi-Shimizu).

5. Modern Consequences

This frequency difference became a major issue after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima disaster, when eastern Japan suffered a power shortage. Because of the limited capacity of frequency converters (initially about 1 GW total), surplus power from the 60Hz western region couldn’t easily be sent to the 50Hz eastern region.

Since then, Japan has invested in increasing converter capacity, but unifying the entire grid remains technically and economically difficult, given the scale of infrastructure that would need to be replaced.

---

So in short, Japan's 50/60Hz split is the result of two early and uncoordinated purchases of foreign technology—one from Germany, one from the U.S.—and the lack of a centralized plan for national standardization at the time.""

This is why the Japanese take so long designing and refining their power tools and batteries, electric vehicles, and all other technology as it needs to be robust and versatile to handle these electrical changes.

It's also why Makita comes out with electric kettles, coffee makers, microwaves, and other niche products; because in disaster situations in the middle of the country the power grid may be in shambles and the  sense of routine in such events that these products can provide can be crucial to lifting spirits and morale.

So next time you wonder why Japan drags it's feet for electric cars, power tools, and other such things that other countries easily adopt, think of this.",72,1748264202.0,Construction,9,0.87,False
1kvtnsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1kvtnsg/had_a_spiritual_experience_during_therapyfeeling/,Had a Spiritual Experience During Therapy—Feeling Strange Afterward. Can Anyone Relate?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened during my somatic therapy session today. I'm not entirely sure what to make of it, but I figured this might be a good space to ask and reflect.

We were working through some trauma, and my therapist asked me to say to myself, “I am a good person,” and to notice where I felt any sensation in my body. I told her I felt this intense pressure right in the middle of my forehead, between my eyebrows—like a finger was pushing into it.

She found that interesting and suggested we try something that might sound a bit “spiritual,” and asked if I was okay with that. I agreed—why not, right?

She guided me through a visualization where I imagined a ray of light—like sunlight—hitting that spot between my brows from outside. Then we added another light, this time coming from within me, also focusing on that same spot. At some point, it felt like something cracked open inside me. Not in a painful way—but more like something was being released. The intense pressure turned into more of a tiny pebble-like sensation. It was… liberating, but also overwhelming.

After that, I had trouble focusing. I felt like I was there physically, but mentally or spiritually I wasn’t fully present. I told her how bizarre my body felt—almost like I was floating. She told me to go for a walk after the session, grab a coffee, really pay attention to what it tastes like—to use my senses to reconnect with the present moment.

I’ve also been doing daily gratitude meditation for the past month—i am not sure if it’s connected?

Right now, I have a deep headache—like it's not just physical, but something deeper inside my head.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Is this a spiritual opening of some sort? A chakra thing? Or just my brain processing trauma in a new way? I’d appreciate any insights or guidance from those who’ve gone through similar things.

I’m currently studying tourism in college, just finished my second year. Recently, I started an unpaid internship at a coffee shop — my friend works there and encouraged me to join. I’ve been working 6-hour shifts without pay, and they said I might get hired once I pass the menu test. The team is generally okay, but there’s one person making everything feel heavy — an old classmate of mine who now works there too. He’s been spreading rumors about me that are exaggerated or simply not true, and he even asked management to let me go.

Emotionally, it’s draining. I don’t want to quit and feel like I “lost” or let him win. But I also don’t want to keep working in a toxic environment where people are judging me based on lies. I told my relatives I started working — if I leave now, it’ll feel embarrassing. So I’m stuck: should I stay or look for a new internship that’s at least paid and respectful?

Another issue is that I feel like I don’t know anything. I barely know how to use a computer — I can turn it on and off, and that’s about it. Even basic jobs like cashier now require some computer skills. I want to learn, I want to be useful — but I just don’t know where to start. I’m scared that in 10 years I’ll still be lost, working hard in a job that doesn’t value me, just like now.

It also hurts seeing my old classmates posting graduation pictures. They’re celebrating, and I feel like I missed out on both school life and real student life. I live with my dad, who’s my closest person in the world. He has health issues right now, and honestly, I feel like I’m the only one he can really count on. But I don’t even feel like I can count on myself yet.

I desperately want to change things this summer. I want to take small steps — start a course, find better work, build something for my future. I’m interested in marketing, creative/visual fields, and tourism. I feel like I could enjoy working in those areas, but I have no skills, no foundation yet. Also, I’m not comfortable filming myself for social media, which can be a downside.

My long-term dream is to have my own place — maybe a small apartment. I’d love to start working toward that goal next year. But getting a mortgage isn’t possible right now because of my dad’s credit history, and I’m only 17. Still, I want to lay the groundwork — study, work, save money. I just don’t know how to begin.

If you’ve been in a similar place — how did you start? Should I stay in the internship or find a better one? How did you find a path that worked for you?

**Date**: 20th May 2025 to 24th May 2025

**Hotel**: Newport Bay Club 

**Meal Plan**: Half Board Plus

**Flight**: Manchester to Charles De Gaulle (Air France)

**Transfer**: Magical Shuttle Private 

**Party**: 2 x adults and 1 x 7 year old



**Restaurants rating**

* Day One - Rainforest Cafe - Immersive, table service, mediocre food - 7/10
* Day Two - PYM Kitchen - Fun, novel and buffet style, good food - 7/10
* Day Three  - Silver Spur Steakhouse - Table Service, Mediocre food, service was a bit slow - 6/10
* Day Four - Yacht Club - Table service, very nice food and if kids choose the yacht desert they will be taken to the chefs counter to decorate with a chef - 8/10
* Day Five - Chez Remy - Table service, our favourite by far. Stunning food and brilliant service - 10/10! 



**Average prices of refreshments** 

* Bottle of soda (coke, fanta, sprite) - 4.50
* Ice creams - 4.50
* Pint of beer - 9.80
* Novelty popcorn buckets - 10.00-12.00
* Cocktail - 10.00-15.00
* Hotdogs, corn dogs, nachos etc - 7.50-12.00
* Coffee - 3.50



**Positives** 

* 100% recommend  spending the extra money for magical shuttle private - A Mercedes Vito waiting for you and whizzing you to the hotel in 45/50 minutes. 
* Ride waits during our trip rarely went over an hour and for some unknown reason, one of the best rides, Avengers Assemble, was never over 15/20 minutes 
* Despite being a massive and busy hotel, we had great sleep throughout and never heard any noise from the corridors etc. Beds and pillows were comfortable
* Half board meal plan seems the best option. We just used cheaper quick service for lunch and saved our evening dinner for our meal plan. 
* Guaranteed access for shows is worth it. 
   * Lion King Show - An absolute MUST watch. It was probably one of the best short shows I have ever seen. This was one of our main highlights. We paid for guaranteed access and glad we did. People were queuing for over an hour prior and lots got turned away. You also get the centre seats with optimal viewing. 
* We took a break from Disney for 6 hours and took a ride into Paris (2.50 each way and 1.25 for kids). Definitely needed it for a sensory reset. Trains every 15 minutes. 



**Cons**

* Newport Bay - Not sure we would stay here again. It is vey tired. 
   * We arrived at Newport Bay reception at about 10am. Despite the app saying (and I quote) “Check in: you can drop your luggage at reception and we’ll take it to your room” and “You don’t have to wait until 3pm. Come by reception at any time for your park tickets and all the hotel documents you’ll need.” - We were told by a cast member (who seemed very fed up) that we cannot do this and to take our luggage outside to the luggage store and pick it up later to take to our rooms. We were told we couldn’t get our passes until after 3pm and to just “use the app”. 
   * Our room was on floor 2 (same floor as reception). The rooms are very tired. Ours overlooked a side part of the hotel that workmen were using to break up old glass windows until about 8pm. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls, the bath ceramic was damaged in various places and the furniture was damaged and handles were hanging off the drawers etc. There was an espresso machine that wasn’t working and the complimentary vittel water was bottles that had clearly been refilled by tap as the seals were broken and frayed off. Also, you don’t get actual cups, just paper cups (not very “4 star”). 
   * Despite the rooms being turned around every day, they never filled up the milk, tea and coffee and we had to ask each day at reception (to the annoyance of the reception staff). 
   * Newport Bay has an indoor and outdoor pool with saunas and steam rooms. Whilst we were there, the outdoor pool was closed, no sauna or steam rooms were working and all hairdryers were broken. The indoor heated pool was very cold and we got out after 20 minutes. 
* Guest behaviour
   * I know poor behaviour is to be expected but my god I didn’t expect it so bad. We witnessed 3 separate occasions of Disney security frogmarching people out of queues for being abusive to other guests and cast members.



Overall

	• A positive trip (slightly let down by the “4 star” Disney hotel).

I've been trying to solve this for the last hour and a half, but I cannot find any problems similar to what I'm experiencing (they are close, but not this).

I have Linux Mint 22.1 (Cinnamon) running in a HP Pavilion laptop with an extra monitor connected via HDMI (specs at the bottom).

I'm trying to use a Huion tablet (HS611) in Krita. I installed the Huion Tablet where I can set up the button mappings and the screen selection. This works alright, I am able to map everything flawlessly --except the screens.

The app thinks that it's mapping to my two monitors (extra monitor sitting on top of laptop base display) but when I use the pen on the tablet, it clearly only moves in the bottom (laptop) display. Images don't seem to be allowed, so I'll describe it as best as I can.

There is an option ""Working Area"" to switch or map what section of the tablet maps to what section of my monitors. When I change this to only use the top monitor, for example, it instead only maps to the top half of my laptop monitor. For the bottom monitor, it only maps to the bottom half of my laptop monitor. Here is where I noticed something is clearly not working. I tried using \`xinput\` for mapping the pen to my second screen, but i get a ""BadMatch"" error. At this point I'm too afraid to make any changes in case I install something uneeded and it conflicts with something else.

I attach the outputs from my system report and also from the xinput. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

1kvtgsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One-Student1976/comments/1kvtgsu/parle_biscuit_a_legacy_behind_the_best_biscuits/,Parle Biscuit: A Legacy Behind the Best Biscuits in India,"When you think of Indian snacks that have stood the test of time, one name that almost always comes to mind is Parle biscuit. For decades, Parle has been a household staple across the country, offering generations of Indians a simple joy: a crispy, sweet bite paired with chai, school tiffins, or even midnight cravings. From nostalgic flavors to modern innovations, Parle’s portfolio reflects why it continues to be ranked among the best biscuits in India.

# A Bite of History

Parle began its journey in 1929 as a small confectionery factory in Vile Parle, Mumbai. At a time when British brands dominated the Indian market, Parle was born out of the idea of creating homegrown products that matched international standards. In 1939, Parle-G, the most iconic Parle biscuit was launched. With its affordability, simplicity, and taste, Parle-G quickly became a favorite, especially among middle-class Indian families.

Over the years, Parle expanded its range and became synonymous with value, trust, and tradition, turning it into one of the most loved and widely distributed biscuit brands in the country.

# What Makes Parle Biscuit the Best?

In a market flooded with cookie and cracker options, what keeps Parle ahead of the curve? The answer lies in its ability to evolve while staying rooted in tradition.

1. **Unmatched Accessibility -** From urban supermarkets to tiny rural kirana shops, Parle biscuits are available everywhere. The brand’s reach ensures that its products are accessible to every Indian, regardless of location or economic status.
2. **Affordable Without Compromising Quality -** Parle's USP has always been offering high-quality products at reasonable prices. Whether it's a classic glucose biscuit or something more indulgent, Parle ensures taste and hygiene are never compromised.
3. **Innovative Flavours and Formats -** While Parle-G remains a timeless bestseller, Parle has diversified into various flavors and formats that cater to changing consumer preferences- from chocolate-filled cookies to light tea-time crackers.
4. **Nostalgia with a Twist -** Many Indians associate Parle biscuits with their childhood. The brand has leaned into this emotional connection while introducing modern packaging and campaigns that appeal to younger generations too.
5. **Health-Focused Variants -** In response to increasing health awareness, Parle has also introduced options like sugar-free and multi-grain biscuits, proving again why it’s considered among the best biscuits in India.

# The Stars of the Shelf

Parle doesn’t just rely on one product to define its identity. Its biscuit range spans from iconic staples to premium treats, each with its own loyal following. Whether it’s a humble glucose biscuit or a rich chocolate cookie, Parle has something for every mood, moment, and market.

# The Cultural Impact

What truly sets Parle apart in the race for the best biscuits in India is its cultural significance. Parle-G has been used in school science projects, featured in movies, and even turned into memes that go viral across social media. It’s more than just a biscuit, it’s a cultural icon.

In fact, during the COVID-19 lockdown, Parle-G saw record-breaking sales. People turned to comfort food, and nothing spelled familiarity and warmth quite like a pack of Parle biscuits.

# Why Parle Biscuit Continues to Reign Supreme

In the ever-growing Indian biscuit market, where new brands are launching every month, Parle remains a consistent favorite. Its ability to innovate without losing authenticity is rare. Its pricing model makes it universally accessible. And its focus on taste, nostalgia, and quality helps it stand tall among competitors.

So if you’re ever wondering which are the [best biscuits in India](https://www.parleproducts.com/), you don’t need to look too far,  just walk into your nearest grocery store, and you’ll likely find a Parle biscuit waiting to be picked up, just like it has for millions of Indians before you.

Parle isn’t just a brand, it’s a feeling, a flashback, a part of our growing-up years. From morning tea rituals to school lunchboxes, hostel cupboards to office pantries, Parle biscuits have accompanied us through every phase of life. They’ve offered comfort during tough times, brought joy to countless chai breaks, and sparked conversations across generations.

Even as the Indian snack market evolves with gourmet cookies and international imports, Parle holds its ground with quiet confidence, reminding us that the best things in life don’t always need reinvention. Sometimes, all it takes is a familiar crunch to take us home.

And that’s the magic of Parle: it manages to be timeless and current all at once. As food habits evolve and choices grow, Parle continues to innovate without losing its soul. That’s why when we talk about the best biscuits in India, Parle isn’t just on the list, it *is* the list.

So whether you’re five or fifty-five, whether you prefer milk, chai, or coffee, there’s always a [Parle biscuit](https://www.parleproducts.com/) that fits the moment. And that’s what makes it truly iconic.",1,1748263576.0,u_One-Student1976,0,1.0,False

## Narrative Synthesis: 11 Strategic Insights from the Deals

### 1. Strategic Maturity Hidden in Deal Cadence
Between 2015 and 2023, aTyr completed over two dozen transactions across equity raises, contract manufacturing, research partnerships, and licensing. These were not erratic. They followed a deliberate tempo—raising capital into data catalysts, formalizing manufacturing right before trial phases, and striking research agreements in anticipation of platform expansions.
- Notably, large raises in 2021–2023 preceded the pivotal Phase 3 trial.
- Manufacturing agreements with FUJIFILM Diosynth and Lonza were timed just before production demand.
- Strategic research deals came right as early data confirmed NRP2 biology’s promise.

**So what?** In my view, this cadence reflects strategic maturity more typical of commercial-stage biotechs. It suggests strong operational planning, high internal confidence, and deliberate sequencing toward launch or acquisition.

⸻

### 2. The Kyorin Licensing Deal Is Grossly Undervalued by the Market
The 2020 Japan licensing deal with Kyorin was worth up to $185M in total consideration (upfront + milestones + royalties) for a single region.
- Japan licensing is notoriously hard for US biotechs to secure.
- The deal was struck before Phase 3 initiation, showing Kyorin’s deep belief in efzofitimod’s future.
- It validated the asset, platform, and team for a conservative market.
- Kyorin has since executed their Phase 1 and signaled ongoing commitment.

**So what?** In my opinion, if Japan alone was worth $185M pre-Phase 3, the US market could be significantly larger post-readout. This deal anchors the lower bound of efzofitimod’s global valuation, yet it’s been entirely ignored in most DCF or market cap models.

⸻

### 3. Platform Unlock Hidden in Research Agreements
Partnerships with institutions like Boston Children’s, MUSC, University of Nebraska, and Dualsystems Biotech weren’t just scientific curiosities—they were pipelines-in-disguise.
- Dualsystems was tasked with identifying 10 new tRNA synthetase targets by 2025.
- Boston Children’s explored tRNA in immune regulation.
- MUSC’s NRP2 collaboration connects to oncology implications of ATYR2810.

**So what?** I believe these academic collaborations are classic “platform seeds.” They enable IP lock-in, generate discovery-stage assets, and build the story needed for Series B–style valuations—despite being buried deep in the PR logs. This is quiet, cumulative platform expansion.

⸻

### 4. Unusual Manufacturer Depth Signals Launch Readiness
aTyr has repeatedly contracted FUJIFILM Diosynth and Lonza, two global manufacturing leaders. These are not short-term CMOs.
- FUJIFILM has supported both ATYR1923 (efzofitimod) and Resolaris.
- Lonza is developing ATYR2810 batches.

**So what?** It appears rare for a company this size to have such manufacturing depth. This signals aTyr is not just trial-ready, but commercially scaled. Whether for BLA/NDA submission or acquisition due diligence, this infrastructure raises the ceiling for valuation discussions.

⸻

### 5. Total Capital Raised (~$900M) Supports Commercial Entry or Strategic Exit
Across equity rounds, private placements, and IPO-related offerings, aTyr has raised over $900M since inception.
- Most recent large raises: $86M (2021), $52M (2023), planned $300M (2023).
- The firm is well capitalized post-Phase 3, with runway into 2026 even without approval.

**So what?** In my view, this capitalization not only supports self-commercialization—it de-risks a fire-sale. It also makes aTyr more attractive for M&A: acquirers don’t need to immediately inject capital. Strategic optionality is maximized.

⸻

### 6. Absence of Big Pharma Co-Development Tells a Story of Leverage
aTyr has zero co-development deals with major pharma players—despite:
- Advancing a biologic into Phase 3
- Holding Orphan and Fast Track designations
- Demonstrating high-dose efficacy and durable response

**So what?** I believe this isn’t oversight. It’s negotiation leverage. aTyr is holding back the crown jewel (efzofitimod global rights) for maximum post-readout valuation. A clean readout sets the table for competitive bidding between global pharma.

⸻

### 7. Early Validation from CSL Behring Signals External Platform Belief
In 2019, CSL Behring—a global immunology heavyweight—invested $17M to collaborate on tRNA synthetase biology.
- This was before ATYR0101 or ATYR2810 existed publicly.
- CSL’s specialty in plasma, rare disease, and immunology made them an ideal validator.

**So what?** In my opinion, this was an early flag that aTyr’s biology was real. In hindsight, CSL’s involvement supports the legitimacy of the whole platform—not just efzofitimod.

⸻

### 8. Multiple Biogeographies Secured: US, EU, Japan, Hong Kong
aTyr has forged deals or been granted IP coverage in:
- US (multiple patents, clinical lead)
- EU (patents, Orphan Drug)
- Japan (Kyorin license)
- Hong Kong (Pangu subsidiary, tRNA research support)

**So what?** The company’s geographic optionality is underrated, in my view. Most microcaps have zero non-US presence. aTyr has built global channels quietly, which supports both global approvals and valuation comp multipliers.

⸻

### 9. tRNA Platform Valuation Is Still Barely Reflected in Market Cap
Only efzofitimod is visible to most investors. Yet aTyr’s tRNA platform includes:
- Novel targets (e.g., LTBP1, FGFR4)
- New indications (fibrosis, cancer)
- Academic discovery engines (Dualsystems, OSU)

**So what?** This setup resembles early-stage Alnylam, Ionis, or even CRISPR/Cas platform plays, in my opinion. The platform value is being ignored—creating a huge disconnect between real strategic value and current share price.

⸻

### 10. Late 2023–2025 Deal Wave Was Structurally Transformative
The timeline shows:
- $52M raised (Feb 2023)
- Dualsystems platform expansion (Oct 2022)
- New patent protections (late 2022–23)
- EFZO-CONNECT launch (late 2023)
- Biomanufacturing scale-up

**So what?** I believe this wasn’t just deal-making—it was a platform transformation arc. By early 2025, aTyr had converted from single-asset to multi-asset platform positioning. Retail missed it. Institutions didn’t.

⸻

### 11. Combination of Orphan, Fast Track, and Platform Assets Creates Asymmetric Optionality
You rarely see this:
- Global Orphan Drug protections
- Fast Track status for two indications
- Multiple mechanisms of action
- Manufacturing + IP + discovery infrastructure

**So what?** In my view, this is what asymmetric bets look like. You’re not just betting on one trial—you’re betting on a company that’s already built the ecosystem before the market priced it in.

If you haven’t read it I recommend it!! 😊,"In this delightfully charming and heartfelt debut love story, two lonely and wildly different strangers embark on a short-term friendship over one London summer—only to discover they may be something more by the time the season ends.

No one would ever call Ava Monroe a people person, which isn’t ideal for a barista in a busy London coffee shop. She’s sarcastic, blunt, and cynical, and her relationships are strictly no strings attached. With her best friend Josie soon leaving for a year, Ava knows she’ll be all alone unless she shakes up her routine. But she can’t risk bringing chance back into her carefully controlled life.

Then insufferably cheerful, country-hopping, undeniably gorgeous Finn O’Callaghan rolls into her coffee shop with a horrifying proposal —a strictly friends-only summer fling. Finn needs a local to help him complete his London bucket list, and Ava needs to reassure Josie she won’t be on her own. And it’s only for a few months.

To Ava’s surprise, their mismatched friendship of convenience becomes oddly tolerable, and as they work their way through Finn’s list and around the sun-drenched city, from rooftops and floating bars to nights at the museum, their adventures—and Finn’s company—start to feel . . . nice. Incredibly, terrifyingly, dangerously nice.

Still, rules are rules—Ava has good reasons for them—and as the days get shorter, Finn’s departure gets closer. Because that’s the thing about it always ends. Right?",2,1748263418.0,MsFreeBooks,1,1.0,False

1kvtdvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1kvtdvy/how_to_exercise/,How to exercise.,"I’m a few months away from turning 30. 5’6ish , Although I don’t consider myself overweight, I have definitely increased my weight significantly from 118 ten years ago to 150 Average now. The highest I’ve weighed is 157 recently, the lowest in the past year is 145.

but more importantly,  I feel unhealthy. I’m starting to get random lower back pains, dizzy spells, hemorrhoids from driving for work a lot and random coughs, my doctor claims that I’m fine and that I need to start exercising.

I actually eat well, with the exception of my daily 2 cups of coffee, sweatened with cream. That’s my only indulge and I rarely eat junk food And really don’t like deserts. I do drink (alcoho) maybe two drinks a week, cocktails usually.

Im single, so I don’t make extravagant meals, mainly olive salads, sushi from restaurants, and I love salmon lox’s sandwiches with avocados.

my biggest drawback is that I hate exercising. I honestly even hate the thought of it, but I seriously need to do it. If I’ve never exercised, should I start by doing a stretching routine first? The most I’ve ever done is walking and occasional bike riding. If I run I get out of breath quickly and get dizzy.  I get extremely bored from yoga and I’m not flexible so it hurts. I get grossed out when I go to the gym. I’ve tried to go as a guest with friends and I can’t deal with other people not cleaning the equipment and men following and staring. I also get jealous of seeing stronger women. I start beating myself up mentally and will just shut down.

So….where tf  do I start and how much time should I do where I don’t quit?

any help would be appreciated.",6,1748263332.0,AskWomenOver30,16,0.8,False
1kvtdlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kvtdlg/does_the_totnz_nugget_ice_maker_truly_deliver/,Does the Totnz Nugget Ice Maker Truly Deliver? In-Depth Review for Buyers,"The Totnz B0DLGBHB12 Nugget Countertop Ice Maker has found a spot in my daily life, delivering convenience with its compact design and chewable nugget ice. As someone who values practicality and ease in kitchen gadgets, testing this product became more than just a review—it became a staple for every drink craving. While the appliance left me satisfied in multiple areas, it does have some quirks worth mentioning.

**Compact Design Meets Versatility**  
When I unboxed this countertop ice maker, its dimensions (9 x 11.3 x 13 inches) stood out immediately. It’s compact enough to fit on kitchen counters without hogging space, making it ideal for small kitchens or even offices. Despite its lightweight design at just 22.6 pounds, it feels sturdy and durable when handled. Unlike bulkier options, this machine can be moved around easily, and it has become a companion for weekend gatherings and casual dinners. There's something appealing about a device that combines portability and functionality so effortlessly.

**Silent Performance that Doesn't Disrupt**  
The first thing I noticed while using this machine was how quiet it is. The noise level barely goes above 47 decibels, making it possible to operate in shared spaces like an open kitchen or office without any issue. I’ve tested louder models in the past, and they made me appreciate this beauty even more. When you have people chatting around the table or need some zen in the morning, the last thing you want is a whirring machine disrupting the environment.

**Efficient Ice Production, But Not Perfect**  
Timing is everything, and that includes how long you wait for ice cubes. This machine churns out ice in seven minutes, which is speedy for a countertop device. The 1.1-liter water tank supports up to 35 pounds of nugget ice daily—plenty for large gatherings or cold drinks throughout the day. These soft, chewable ice pellets are delightful; my nephew calls them ""fun ice"" because they’re easy to munch on. While consistency in quality is usually reliable, I did experience minor hiccups: one batch felt slightly watery, possibly due to fluctuating room temperatures. 

**Check [Totnz B0DLGBHB12](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dlgbhb12/) deals on Amazon now.**

**Simple, User-Friendly Design with Minimal Learning Curve**  
Operating this pellet ice machine couldn’t be simpler. It features a single ""ICE"" button, meaning everything is ready to go with the press of a finger. Being someone who admittedly skips instruction manuals, this straightforward design earned major points. There's no steep learning curve, and getting family and guests to operate it is equally hassle-free. However, I noticed a lack of customization options—those wanting to adjust ice density or speed might find this limiting.  

**Delightful Nugget Ice Perfect for Any Occasion**  
Whether mixed into a refreshing iced coffee in the morning or dropped into a fizzy soda to end the day, the chewable ice adds that extra bit of flair. Compared to standard cubes, these pellets are softer and easier on sensitive teeth, which was appreciated by my mom during her trial run. They dissolve slower than crushed ice, keeping drinks cool for longer without watering them down too quickly. 

**Strengths**  
- Produces chewable nugget ice perfect for drinks.  
- Compact and portable, saving counter space.  
- Quiet operation, less than 47 decibels.  
- Quick ice production time of seven minutes.  

**Downsides**  
- Lacks customization options for ice preferences.  
- Occasional inconsistency in ice texture.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to competing products like GE’s Opal Ice Maker and Frigidaire’s Compact Ice Maker, this nugget ice machine holds its ground well. It’s significantly lighter than the Opal model, which makes moving it easier, though it doesn’t feature advanced Bluetooth controls or an app like GE offers. On the other hand, Frigidaire’s model is marginally cheaper and similarly compact but produces traditional ice cubes instead of soft and chewable nuggets. The Totnz maker carves its niche by delivering both portability and nugget-specific ice categories—ideal for those who prioritize ice texture. However, if you'd like more advanced settings or fancier features, spending more on premium competitors might be justified.

**Money's Worth**  
At its price range, this ice maker balances affordability with substantial daily output and functional design. You'll find more expensive models brimming with features but often at the cost of convenience or portability. Conversely, ultra-cheap alternatives fail to deliver the consistent quality this machine manages to showcase—even with its few quirks. For those simply looking for reliable nugget ice at home or in the office minus hefty investments, this machine strikes a sweet spot.

Problem/Goal:
I’m a 3rd-year college student, the youngest in our family, and I’m doing my best to stay in school despite serious financial and emotional struggles. I’m hoping to find support, advice, or resources that can help me continue.

Context:
Before, I used to think adulting was just one of those things people joked about online—like memes about bills or needing coffee to survive. I’d laugh and scroll past, thinking “Di ko pa kailangang intindihin 'yan.” I was a teen, and life felt light.

But now, reality really hit me hard.

I’m the bunso, and I’m the only one in my family who’s made it to college. I’m about to enter my third year. Dati, I was proud of that. But lately, it just feels heavy. Ever since my dad passed away last July, everything has changed. Life hasn’t given us a break since then.

My mom’s been doing everything she can just to get me through school. I see her swallow her pride, asking for help from relatives, just so I have something to eat or money for fare. And it breaks me. Kasi alam ko, ako yung dahilan kung bakit siya nahihirapan. I try to help—I applied for DSWD’s 1k monthly aid, and I’ve been applying to summer jobs, pero wala pa ring swerte.

And honestly, it’s not just the money that’s hard. My mental health? Sobrang bigat. Every day feels like may bato sa dibdib ko. I wake up tired. I cry randomly. And sometimes, I catch myself praying things I never thought I’d say like, “Lord, hindi ko na kaya. Kung pwede po, tapusin na natin ’to.” Ang hirap kasi when you’re trying so hard, but everything just keeps hitting you from all sides—pati pananampalataya mo sinusubok.

Pero ayun, I still get up. I still show up. Maybe because I love my mom so much. I want her to rest someday. I want her to feel proud. I want to break this cycle for her—for us.

I’m not fully an adult yet, but life didn’t wait for me to be ready. Pinilit ako tumibay kahit hindi pa ako buo. Pero kahit pagod na, lumalaban pa rin.

Previous Attempts:

Applied for DSWD financial aid (P1,000/month)

Tried applying for summer jobs (still waiting for luck)

Trying to stay strong mentally, spiritually, emotionally kahit minsan gusto ko nang sumuko


What I’m Hoping For:

Advice from anyone who went through something like this
Words of encouragement
Just a safe space where I can breathe a little and not feel so alone

I'm working on an AI tool we built specifically to automate chatting on OnlyFans, and I wanted to share what we’ve seen on some client accounts.

One agency had 3 full-time chatters managing DMs for a single high-traffic account. We launched a test using our system, **Substy AI**, to see if the AI could keep up  or even do better.

**After 30 days:**

Revenue: $14K → $27K  
PPV open rate: 17% → 33%  
Manual chatting: 0 hours  
Messages: 100% automated, 24/7

That agency now runs **12 accounts entirely on AI**.  
No more hiring, training, or managing chatter teams.

Substy AI learns each fan’s tone, builds natural sexual tension, sends optimized PPVs, and adapts message flow and pricing in real time.  
Some accounts are now hitting **$50K+/month fully automated**.

Not here to pitch but if you manage multiple creators and you're tired of the constant HR overhead from chattering, this can genuinely change the way you scale.

1kvt6ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/NIO_Stock/comments/1kvt6ur/why_nios_competition_is_not_byd_and_why_price_is/,Why NIO’s Competition Is Not BYD — and Why Price Is No Longer the Key Driver for a Crucial Segment of the Chinese Market,"There seems to be a conceptual mistake in those headlines saying “the trade war heats up” or “price war in the EV sector.”  
Many talk about a “price war” between BYD and the rest, as if we were dealing with a supermarket of commodities.  
That analysis stems from a deep conceptual error:  
believing that all brands compete on the same plane.

Mercedes doesn’t lower its prices if Dacia does.  
Volvo doesn’t panic if Renault launches a cheaper hatchback.  
And NIO doesn’t need to compete with BYD, because it targets a completely different consumer.

That customer doesn’t walk into a BYD dealership — not even if they give them a Seagull with a ribbon on it.  
BYD can lower the price of its Seagull to $7,800.  
Fine. It makes sense for its business model: scale, capillarity, fleet logic.  
But thinking this affects brands like NIO, Li Auto or Mercedes is confusing mobility with identity.

China also has an elite, demanding audience that would never step into a BYD store.  
BYD plays the volume game, public access, state contracts. And it plays it well.  
But to pretend that a BYD discount compromises NIO’s value proposition is like saying Zara threatens Hermès.

China is not a homogenous block of price-seeking buyers.  
It’s a country with hundreds of millions of emotionally complex, visually demanding, culturally hybrid consumers.

Chinese consumers are narcissistic, hedonistic, traditional, and modern.  
And among them emerge archetypes like:“Progressive maximalists”, young extroverts who seek innovationAnd “the narcissist”, who rejects traditional values and seeks novelty, fashion, and luxury. 32% of the country already fits into one of these two profiles.

That is not a customer comparing price per kilometer.  
It’s someone who chooses with the same eye they use to select their Leica camera, their COS outfit, or their single-origin coffee.

That customer doesn’t want a cheap car.  
They want an experience that represents them.

NIO is selling an atmosphere, a lifestyle, a visual and emotional experience — something that could easily be signed by Leica, Bang & Olufsen or COS.

Building customer loyalty through identity — not functionality — takes decades.  
It took Mercedes, BMW or Audi over 50 years to emotionally bind product, belonging, and lifestyle.  
NIO is doing it in under a decade, with a narrative that’s far more aligned to the codes of the 21st-century Chinese consumer.

Without going on and on about what happened, the gist of it is that I stayed up pretty late working on something I’ve needed to finish. Around midnight I noticed a car across the street from my building with the brake lights on. It struck me as odd so I looked out and tried to see who was in there, but I assumed it was just someone hanging out in their car for a little while even though it gave me kind of a weird feeling. It’s not completely out of the norm to see that where I live. I live in a big city, though my neighborhood is on the quieter side, so it’s some thing you’d notice. Fast-forward to 4 AM when I finish my work and I see that this car is still out there, lights still on, and I realize it’s a woman who looks exactly like my ex doing all of the same things she used to do in her car. Smoking cigarettes, vaping, drinking a huge 32 ounce cup of coffee, and smoking other suspicious things that I couldn’t exactly make out. We officially broke up a few months ago and we were on and off for a time and she always engaged in creepy stalking behavior in the off times, so this wouldn’t really be out of the norm for her, but I meant to get to sleep and I haven’t gotten a wink of sleep because I’ve just been stressing out over whether or not this was her. I recorded her sitting in her car for a few minutes and eventually, I guess she must’ve noticed that I was looking so she finally drove off, and I’m very much not the kind of person that calls the cops, but I regretted not calling. I just didn’t want to do it in case it wasn’t her, but I’m tired of dealing with crap like this. She’s an addict and as much as she lies and pretends that she is kind of sober at least off of the hard stuff, it’s very obvious that she’s not and is someone who’s deeply uninterested in recovery. She has a lot of other issues as well and I really feel for her and wish her the best but I’m so tired of this crap happening. I’ve just been sitting here reviewing these videos, which are grainy as hell because it was still dark and I was pretty zoomed in so the quality is shit. But based on everything she was doing, the way she was sitting, and her mannerisms, I’m pretty positive it was her and I just have a gut feeling. The only thing that’s making me feel a little better is that I can’t really see a tattoo that she has on the side of her hand in the video which I was actually able to get a clear-ish shot of. Not clear enough, but it’s the only thing that’s making me think it might not have been her and that I’m stressing over nothing. She became very abusive over the last couple of years and I think that’s why my mind is just racing with possibilities. I’m not really even sure why I’m posting this because I don’t really know what I can do about this. I guess if I see her again I’m definitely going to call the cops. The thing is that she was in a different car. Though it looks familiar and I’m pretty sure it’s her stepfather’s. So this has all just been keeping me up all night and I guess I just needed to vent and get some support on this. Part of me wants to share the screenshots of the videos I got compared to pictures of her in hopes that someone will just tell me that it’s not her, but I don’t really wanna go that far. My heart was racing for so long and I don’t even think I feel scared. I’m just really sick of her shit and I don’t understand why she doesn’t just leave me alone. Again, I’m not 100% positive that it was her, but all signs suggest that it was. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this or just have any advice?

As I've leaned more towards self discovery (less social media presence, more time with myself to process events and increasing awareness towards my own feelings) and understanding and improving my way of communication, I began to notice a shift in perception from people around me and I feel is from people filling in the gaps. It started subtle at first but people are getting increasingly more vocal about it with most interactions I find myself in (with people I haven't interacted in a while).

For the better part of 2023 and early 2024 I used to broadcast a lot of my activity via stories on social media platform. At that time, I found it easier to let employees, co-workers, friends and relatives know what I'm up to this way rather than individually replying to their enquiries. Half way through 2024 I began reducing my social media presence more and more in order to deal with the burnout I knew was going to come. This lead to an increase in interactions such as ""Hey - what have you been up to? I'm in town, wanna grab a coffee and catch up?"" or spending more time talking face to face at events rather than online. The problem is every time I do one of these catch up the bigger the delta in what people thought I was doing vs what I am doing.

I'm 1 year into working on a personal art/game project and most of this year was spent working on it, doing some freelancing, but mostly engaged in work, research and only going out for big, impactful events where In the past I used to go out almost daily, mostly to numb my emotional state.

Specific Examples:

* meet up with a friend and ex-co worker from a few years ago and she thought I neglected honing my craft and was mostly focused on partying and clubbing.
* another friend came into town for a big event happening next week and I got together for dinner with him and he mentioned people around him (another art enclave from a different city) are worried a bit about me because I focus too much on being out going and partying so much.
* people from some discords I manage have expressed discontent that I'm not releasing the project and that I need to keep it in my pants more and write more code.
* a really old friend of mine shared during one of our nature hikes that she's a tiny bit annoyed that I'm loosing focus on ""what's important"".

And every time I try to explain how it is I'm receiving pushback that I'm downplaying the situation. For a while I tried going with ""Yeah you're right, I need to do focus more and embrace work more"" just to avoid entering a discussion about the push back and stop worrying them but then the word spread that ""yep, but at least he's aware"". Now I'm an HG member and I've been going through Dr K. lectures both on YT and on the membership site and I even tried going meta and approaching them with ""Is there a way in which I can disprove what you're saying? Can you see a way in which I could feasibly show you that's not the case?"" and most of the time I get hit back with a ""No"".

I even explored being completely honest and opening up and meeting the situation half way by saying: ""Hey, thank you for worrying about me, 2024 was horrible for most of us and we lost a lot of our own peers in the industry's cluster fuck and I love and appreciate you deeply. The truth of the matter is that the situation is exactly opposite of what you're saying and I'm actually worried that I mellowed down a lot and I spent too much time in solitude"" but that caused an even bigger emotional reaction from the other person.

Now when I asked why do you think that - it all came back to ""well, you used to share a lot of your progress online and I guess that now you have none to share..."". The thing is - I'm not sure what I could share or even if I should accommodate this request. I truly feel that reducing discord, instagram and facebook usage has lead to me engaging and communicating much more meaningful with the people I care for and has relieved some of the burnout effects that I was getting. I'm much more aware and grounded nowadays and a lot more content with myself.

I do miss the degenerate and debauchery days a bit but on the other hand, most of the reason I was engaging in constant parties was to increase my self esteem and numb my anxiety back then by constantly proving I'm quite a catch and I can be the life of a party and I don't really need to anymore, nor do I feel the need to broadcast this.

So I feel like I'm a bit stuck between having to manage the people that I care for (friends and industry peers that walked through fire with me) and managing my own self. 2024 was a brutal year for us and the last thing I want is to enable their worries. On the other hand, I'm also a bit afraid of meeting them half way to re-assure them as the temptation to broadcast my exploits will lead into me engaging in much more exploits and an overwhelming need to prove myself once again. I'm quite happy and content right now and I can turn on/off the degenerate in me when I feel the need to.

TLDR: The less I share of what I'm doing online, the more people worry that I'm doing the opposite of what is actually happening and I can't find a good way to manage their needs while stay authentic and engaged with my own path.",1,1748262541.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

Is there a place you recommend for tableware or decorating a flat?

I also have a lot of clothes to get rid of and this might just be my overthinking but do charity shops ever turn away clothes? 

I would never take anything resembling rags but a lot of stuff I want to get rid of is fast fashion and it might just be me but I’ve not seen much of that when I go thrift shopping here so I just wanted to double check

1kvsz6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kvsz6k/shareholders_beware_brian_will_fail/,Shareholders Beware: Brian Will Fail,"I’ve been a Starbucks partner for six years. I’ve seen good leadership, bad leadership, and a lot of corporate fluff in between but I’ve never felt the company so hollowed out as I do right now. That’s why I’m writing this. Because what’s happening under Brian Niccol isn’t just a tough period, it’s a complete unraveling of the company’s foundation. And if shareholders don’t act, I fear there won’t be much left to save.

When Brian came on board, the company was already facing real challenges: rising prices, declining food and drink quality, growing customer complaints, understaffing, and a cold, corporate feel taking the place of what once made Starbucks special. He didn’t cause all of it but instead of addressing the core problems, he layered on hollow, PR-friendly ""solutions"" that made life worse for baristas and customers alike.

**1. The Cup Writing Mandate: Performative and Punitive**

One of Brian’s first major moves was to mandate that baristas *must* write personalized notes or names on every cup. What used to be a thoughtful, organic gesture became a required standard—backed by the threat of write-ups or being sent home if we didn’t comply.

This is a perfect example of how disconnected this leadership is. The stores are already understaffed. Wait times are up. Baristas are struggling to juggle multiple positions at once. So instead of fixing staffing levels, he decided to add another step to the process that does nothing but slow us down and give already overbearing managers another way to punish noncompliance.

**2. Menu “Simplification” That Complicates Everything**

Then came the ""menu simplification"" rollout, which was advertised as a way to make ordering easier for customers and prep easier for baristas. In reality, it was just a quiet removal of several fan-favorite drink buttons from our Point Of Sale (POS) system. The drinks themselves? Still ordered. Still expected.

Now we’re manually building them with individual modifiers, which slows everything down and costs the customer *more*—since the drink no longer exists as a single item, every piece of it is now rung in separately. A win for no one, yet sold to corporate as an improvement.

**3. Dress Code Chaos: A Micro-Managed Mess**

Next up: the dress code disaster. Baristas were given no clear notice about new standards until *after* Starbucks had a fire sale on the previously approved items. Once those were sold out, we were told we couldn’t wear them. Then came the expectations to comply before the new dress code-approved items had even been delivered.

Partners removed piercings, dyed their hair, and bought new clothes, only to still be sent home for sock colors. Not only is this demoralizing, it makes the staffing crisis worse. We’re losing floor coverage because of uniform policing while customers wait longer and our morale tanks.

The forced uniformity has stripped away personality, creativity, and the sense of identity that made Starbucks a special place to work *and* visit. And yes customers *noticed* our outfits. Before we got compliments. They sparked conversations. Now, we're all a walking funeral and customers have noticed the demoralizing change.

**4. He Gets the Payday, You Get the Loss**

Here’s what should *really* worry shareholders: Brian Niccol is being paid *tens of millions of dollars*—more than most shareholders will *ever* see in returns while making decisions that actively damage the long-term health of the company.

He’s building a house of cards. He’s inflating short-term metrics, ignoring frontline input, and focusing on surface-level optics. And when it all catches up to the company, he’ll walk away with his golden parachute. **You**, the shareholders, will be left with the fallout: declining brand loyalty, eroding customer trust, poor retention, and a shattered internal culture.

This is not someone playing a long game. This is someone squeezing what’s left out of the brand before handing the mess to the next CEO who will be left to take the blame.

**Shareholders, It’s Time to Act**. Starbucks needs more than good optics. It needs real leadership.

We need a CEO who understands that the core of Starbucks isn’t tech gimmicks, streamlined UIs, or branding spin. It’s people. It’s a coffeehouse experience rooted in real connection. You don’t get that by replacing people with apps, micromanaging socks, or cutting corners on staffing.

If you care about this brand’s longevity, it’s time to vote Brian out *before* the damage becomes irreversible. Bring in leadership that respects operations. That invests in staffing. That uses tech to support rather than replace the partners. Leadership that listens. That *cares*.

All I’ve ever wanted to do is serve the right coffee to the right person in a reasonable amount of time. Find us a CEO who respects that like Howard once did.

**Don’t wait for the inevitable collapse to act. By then, Brian will be gone and you’ll be the ones left holding the bag.**

Before it’s too late.

Most hikers start in March and April. To be fair I’d only learned about the AT a month prior when I read Bill Bryson’s “A Walk in the Woods” and it took me 45 days to gather all the gear and learn enough to feel comfortable starting off on such a tremendous journey. Starting in May is fine if you’re a fast hiker. That’s what we did in 2024. We started late May and finished early September. But in 2016 I wasn’t a fast hiker. I averaged just 10 miles a day.

I’d “flipped up” to Maine in August from Harper’s Ferry and headed southbound because I knew I wouldn’t be able to reach Mt. Katahdin before it closed for the winter. I found a great group of other flip-floppers and southbounders who’d started late and we made our way south at a leisurely pace. I camped at almost every pond along the trail in Maine, some days hiking as little as 4 miles before setting up camp and floating out onto the pristine waters using my inflatable sleeping pad as a raft.

This dalliance with the good life put us way behind schedule and we ended up on-top of Mt. Washington during a snow-storm in late September. Mt. Washington is the deadliest mountain in the continental US with 150 known fatalities, due in large part to the extreme weather and easy accessibility of the summit. Mt. Washington is a perfect example of what happens when private interests are allowed to control and profit off of public lands.

There’s a train that climbs to the summit of the mountain. Completed in 1869 by Sylvester Marsh, “The Cogline” was the world's first mountain-climbing cog railway. The Mount Washington Auto Road, originally a carriage road built in the 1850s and later adapted for automobiles, is also a private toll road. The cog charges $95 per passenger. The toll-road charges $36 per passenger. In the summer the peak will see 5,000 visitors per day, most of them arriving via the train and road. The rocks at the summit of Mt. Washington are stained black from the soot of countless trips that the coal-burning cog train has made up and down the mountain since the 1800s. They’ve recently installed a bio-diesel train but still run the coal train once a day, which burns one ton of coal per trip.

New England was colonized and populated before the laws protecting our public lands were put in place. We hiked the Long Trail in addition to the AT thru-hike last year and every single 4k ft peak in Vermont on the Long Trail, save one had a private ski-resort at the top. Thru-hikers grumble about the “Appalachian Money Club” when they hike through the Whites because this is the only stretch of trail under the control of a private(non-profit) entity, whereas the rest of the 2,200 mile trail is controlled by public entities like USFS, BLM, and DOI.

For example the shelters and camping are free for the 2,200 mile trail except the stretch in the White Mountains controlled by the AMC. Here it costs between $15 and $50 for the camping and shelters. Often there’s simply not enough shelter space or campsites to go around.

It is my opinion that this is by design. This becomes very apparent when you take a look at Appalachian Mountain Club’s business model. They derive most of their revenue($46 million in 2023) from charging exorbitant fees for hikers to stay in their mountain cabins. For example, throughout the White Mountains there are 418 bunk beds available through the various huts; these huts were established by the AMC before protection on public lands were put in place and therefore the AMC holds a unique role where they are allowed to manage, and profit off of public land. There are less than 80 designated campsites through the same stretch along the AT. If you want a bunk at the hut it will cost $170/night. At peak season Lake of the Clouds is bringing in $350,000 per month of revenue. And they pay their hut employees $13.84/hr starting off. These employees have to hike up all of the food and supplies for their guests carrying packs that weigh 90 to 110lbs. In 2023 AMC’s CEO made $338,223.

>

These are the only campsites available if you want to camp in the presidential traverse around Mt. Washington. If you maxed out the capacity that’s only 14 tents sites. In 2024 we hiked the entire Presidential traverse, 26 miles with about 9,000ft of gain and loss so that we would have guaranteed places to camp. A massive day and I puked shortly after the summit of Washington; we got trail magic up there and I’d drank two cokes and eaten two sandwiches. Not a good idea when you’re trying to maintain a 3 mph pace in the presidential range. Slower hikers, which often means older hikers, are forced to pay for spaces in the huts because they simply can’t make the miles required.

The huts will allow hikers to “work for stay” but it is entirely at the discretion of the crew that’s working and often limited to only two hikers. It’s not uncommon for hikers to be kicked out of the huts into terrible storms. In 2024 I met three Amish brothers. The Schmidt brothers. They were finishing the last leg of the AT which they’d broken up into three big sections. They were incredibly strong and fast hikers and we kept passing each other during the presidential traverse and exchanged stories. It surprised me to learn how well traveled the brothers were. One liked to go deep-sea fishing in Florida and Hawaii, another had backpacked through Europe, and they were all avid outdoorsmen and backpackers.

The brothers wore a matching outfit of blue-jeans with suspenders, flannel shirts, and big straw hats. They each had the iconic “Shenandoah beard” and spoke with a peculiar accent that I’ve never heard before. Their outfits were an odd juxtaposition with their Osprey backpacks and otherwise very typical backpacking gear. They told me how two nights before they’d almost been kicked out of the Galehead hut during a severe thunderstorm. I vividly remember that storm, we’d tried to camp at Liberty Springs campsite but it was completely full by the time we arrived at 5pm. We had to hike up the mountain an additional mile and camped right underneath a “no camping” sign on the only flat piece of ground we could find. The weather was horrible. Cold rain, high winds, and lightning. I had to drag away big branches that the AMC had strewn about the ground in order to discourage camping.

That’s another of the AMC’s dirty tactics. They actively fill in any flat sites where people can “stealth camp”(camp without paying) by covering any campsites in branches and fallen trees. They do this under the guise of “protecting resources.” If they really cared about protecting resources they would build more tent platforms. They don’t do that because if people had more options to camp they wouldn’t pay $170/night for their huts. Anyway the night of that storm the Schmidt brothers were sheltering in Galehead hut and around 5pm the hut crew told them that they had to leave. Galehead hut sits above treeline at 3,800ft. Described by the AMC as “the most remote location in our White Mountains hut system, Galehead Hut offers access to soaring peaks and sublime waterfalls.”

The storm was at its peak when the crew was trying to kick out the three Amish brothers. Thunder and lightning were crashing outside. High winds were driving the rain into the walls and windows of the hut in torrential sheets. And the crew was telling the brothers that they needed to leave the hut now because they’re about to start serving dinner to the paying customers. When the brothers asked them where they were supposed to go, the hut crew told them that they could hike a few miles to get below tree-line and camp. Hike a few miles exposed to the full brunt of the storm above tree line, in driving winds, cold rain, and lightning.

Finally, after the brothers stood strong and said they weren’t going to risk their lives in the crazy weather the crew members relented and let them sleep on the floor, but only after they put the brothers to work cleaning out the bathrooms and kitchen. I posted this story on my Instagram and received dozens of similar stories from hikers recounting their own experience of getting kicked out into dangerous weather by hut crew. Think I’m exaggerating the danger? That same night, during that same storm, on August 22nd, 2024, a 72 year old man would die of exposure half a mile below the summit of Mt. Washington. A thru-hiker would discover his body the next day.

A triple-crowner, Rafiki, died in January of 2024. Rafiki got caught in a winter storm as he attempted a single day Pemi traverse in the White Mountains. He called for emergency services and continued to move into the night in an effort to stay warm and self-rescue. I learned from one of his good friends that Rafiki’s GPS tracker showed that he’d walked circles around one of the huts trying to find a way in, but wasn’t able to enter the hut. The huts are locked and sealed for the winter. If he’d been able to gain shelter inside the hut perhaps he could have survived. This is pure speculation on the part of Rafiki’s friends but not unreasonable.

Now I’m not being entirely fair to the AMC. They do maintain the trail in this section. They do provide educational opportunities and jobs in the outdoors, and they do a lot of work for conservation. I think their leadership(based out of Boston) is overpaid and out of touch. I think they clearly care more about maximizing revenue and thus they cater to rich patrons from Boston and the surrounding areas, rather than making the outdoors accessible for all. I think a public land agency would do a better job of managing that land.

I’ve hiked that stretch in 2016, 2022, and 2024 now. There are muddy areas in that stretch of trail which have boards to help hikers traverse them. The same boards which were rotted out in 2016 have still not been replaced by 2024. There are now user made trails around those sections which have killed the fragile bushes in the alpine zone because no hiker is going to wade into knee deep mud when they can walk around the puddle. Much of the trail in the White mountains desperately needs to be rerouted because the trail is worn down to bare bedrock. One section just south of Zealand hut is literally a stream whenever it rains because that’s the path of least resistance for the water. Hikers have made their own trails around this treacherous section. Rather than building new, safer trails, the AMC instead throws branches to cover the hiker-created trails to force people to use the unsafe stream “trail.”

The trail in Vermont and Maine, both maintained by volunteers, are in dramatically better condition than the trail in New Hampshire maintained by the AMC. Ask any thru-hiker. This is simply the truth. The rest of the AT is managed by public land agencies and it’s only in this section managed by the private AMC organization that hikers encounter these myriad problems. This is why I firmly stand against the privatization of public lands. The only people who benefit from privatization are the private individuals who own the land, the public inevitably pay a higher price for worse service.

The average nonprofit CEO compensation is $152,119, according to the Economic Research Institute. You would think that the CEO of an outdoors oriented non-profit wouldn’t make more than twice the national average, yet she does. $338,223. AMC’s CEO makes .73% of AMC’s entire revenue. To put this into comparison, the CEO of The New York And Presbyterian Hospital was paid $9.3 million in 2023, one of the highest paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. Yet that was only .09% of their revenue of 10.3 billion. So when you account for the relative sizes of the two non-profits the AMC CEO is paid eight times more than her counterpart if we equalized their revenue. The executive compensation is simply way out of line with other outdoor nonprofits. For example the CEO of the Montana Conservation Corps made $146,715 in 2023. Conservation Legacy, with a comparable revenue of $48.5 billion paid their CEO $180,030 in 2023.

**Appalachian Money Club.** The name is well deserved.

In 2016 we sheltered in “The Dungeon” at Lake of the Clouds hut. The dungeon is an emergency shelter built below the main hut. It’s a tiny room about 10’ by 10’ that has a stack of old wooden triple bunks. The walls are bare stone. It is meant to be an emergency shelter for hikers caught in the unpredictable weather on-top of Mt. Washington. There was a winter storm forecast and rather than risk getting caught out in it we chose to instead stay at the dungeon.

When we stayed there in 2016 it was free. Now the AMC charges you $10 per person for the privilege of escaping death. We ended up squeezing nine people into the tiny room. Six in the triple-stacked bunks and three on the floor. Bear, standing at an astounding 7’1” and weighing over 300lbs was one of the hikers on the floor.

Footage from Mt. Washington and The Dungeon in this short 1 min video:

I’m still inspired by Bear’s story. He started the trail weighing over 400lbs and it took him two days to hike the eight mile approach trail. He said he’d pick a tree, hike to it, then take a break. That was how he managed for the first weeks of the trail before he lost weight and got in better shape. By the time I met him he’d lost almost 100lbs. He said what drove him was the fact that he “wanted to be the kind of man who could finish such a challenge” and wanted to become an Army officer after the trail. I don’t think he ever became an Army officer but he did go on to become a counselor and social worker. Before starting the trail he’d been working in Chicago as a tow-truck driver and he was so intent on finishing the AT that he stopped making payments on his truck. He couldn’t afford to both hike and make his truck payments. His truck at home was repossessed when he was hiking through Vermont. Bear would go on to finish the trail and it took him almost nine months. In the end he lost 150lbs.

The night in The Dungeon was memorable and a lot of fun. I had a big bag of peanut M&Ms and we made a game of trying to throw the M&M’s into each other’s mouths. We stayed up late sharing ghost stories while the wind howled outside. So we benefited from the fact that Lake of the Clouds hut existed. It’s not all black and white. I’m sure the accessibility of the summit at Mt. Washington has allowed many more people to experience the incredible beauty of the mountain range, people who otherwise wouldn’t have the physical capacity to hike to the top. By this same token however the ease of accessibility has led to dozens of deaths of people who were unprepared for the conditions at the top of Washington.

I think overall public lands need to remain in public hands and be managed by public land agencies. I love thru-hiking because of the equality inherent in the wilderness. It doesn’t matter how much money you have, you still have to carry your own pack. Campsites and shelters are first come first serve. Money doesn’t buy you any extra privileges along the AT. Except in the White Mountains that are controlled by the AMC. Here, money does buy you extra privileges. Money buys you places to sleep where poor hikers have to continue on or beg for the opportunity to clean toilets in exchange for sleeping on the floor. Having the money to pay $170 for a bunk means you won’t be kicked out into a dangerous storm.

I don’t like that. I don’t want the outdoors to become any more of a pay to play system than it is. Even now the vast majority of thru-hikers are white(90% according to [halfwayanywhere.com](http://halfwayanywhere.com) surveys). Because it takes money and resources to buy gear and take six months off of work. Let’s not make it anymore expensive or inaccessible by privatizing public land.

# US Marshall’s Hold Hikers at Gunpoint

I’m reminded of Colin “Zen” Gooder. He ran Gooder Grove in Franklin, NC. I first met him in 2016 and would spend three nights at his hostel that year. Zen had just started it up after his mother had passed and left him her house the year before. He’d already filled the tree in his front-yard with the discarded shoes of hikers by the time I arrived in late May.

Zen picked me up along with three other hikers from the road in his beat-up Honda Civic and drove us into town. “What’s up dude, I’m Zen, nice to meet you.” Zen spoke like a California surfer dude. Very mellow. Very chill. Very much high on weed night and day. We arrived at his house, the lawn filled with a random mix of lawn gnomes and Buddha statues. “It’s all good guys, come on in. Welcome to Gooder Grove.”

Despite Zen’s trail name he was not very Zen. I found him to be quite chaotic, high-strung, and manic. Every morning he would fly through the house in a panic, searching for his keys and his coat, late to pick-up hikers, muttering under his breath the whole time. He liked to spend the nights getting super high with hikers and recounting far-out stories. About the only time I’d seen him truly calm was after he’d smoked two bowls.

He recounted to me a story of how he’d had a break with reality the year before when his dead father had visited him. I couldn’t ever quite figure out if this was a psychedelic experience, a dream, or just something that happened to him in his normal waking consciousness. Zen liked to pull out the Tao Te Ching and hold hikers verbally hostage as he read random passages from the book. In the years that passed Zen developed a controversial reputation on trail. Some hikers loved him and had great experiences. Many other hikers fought with him and got into verbal and physical confrontations with Zen and were unceremoniously booted from his hostel.

I think Zen suffered from mental health issues exacerbated by the fact that he wasn’t really equipped to run a hostel. This is a case where he would’ve done much better to charge a higher rate and run his hostel like a business. Zen had a good heart and couldn’t turn people away and couldn’t stomach the thought of overcharging for his services. Thus, he couldn’t ever really afford employees and his erratic behaviors drove off what few employees he did manage to hire.

Two weeks after I hiked on from Gooder Grove in 2016 I heard that the US Marshall’s raided the hostel. The Marshall’s held hikers at gunpoint while they arrested a felon who had absconded his probation. The felon had been hiding out at Gooder Grove pretending to be a hiker. I’d met him! He claimed his trail name was Pippin because he liked to smoke the pipe. We all got a weird vibe from Pippin and his story didn’t add up. His gear was a mishmash of random things that no thru-hiker would use, and he’d been staying at the hostel for over a month doing random jobs for Zen to pay for his bunk.

It turns out that Pippin was a convicted child molestor and had absconded his probation and left the state. He’d been found by the Marshalls because he’d used his cell phone to contact his ex. Truly, my friend Fritz from Montana was right. The worst crime any criminal ever commits is the crime of being stupid.

Zen would kidnap me off the trail in 2022 during my Calendar Year Triple Crown. He’d messaged me offering to let me stay in his hostel a week before, but I’d planned to skip Franklin. I didn’t need to stop there and wanted to keep making good time. I told him thanks for the offer but I’m just going to keep on hiking and I won’t stop until the NOC. So imagine my surprise when I saw Zen hiking toward me from a trailhead.

“Quadzilla! I was just following my gut intuition and it told me I’d see you here today! What’s up brother?!” Yeah, your gut intuition and my Facebook stories most likely. “Come into town with me!” Zen wouldn’t take no for an answer and basically kidnapped me into town that night. It wasn’t entirely unwelcome. It was February and it was still cold out so getting a shower and a warm bed was very welcome. It also happened to be my birthday. I turned 37 that day. Zen and I went out to get a Chinese buffet for dinner. I paid for our dinner and put some gas in his van. I knew Zen was always having money problems.

He’d expanded his hostel with more bunks since 2016 and now had a big 12 passenger van. He filled me in on all the drama he was currently embroiled in. The girl he’d hired for the summer just told him she wasn’t coming because people had sent her messages slandering him. He was fighting with the owners of a new hostel in Franklin. He sat me down and recorded a new video series he was starting. He wanted it to be like “Between Two Ferns” and interview hikers. “Ah, this is why he’d kidnapped me.” The owners of the new hostel in Franklin had started a similar series with the hikers coming through their doors.

Even though I was exhausted from hiking 128 miles in five days I sat up with Zen and we recorded his video. It wasn’t great. Here it is. He uploaded it to his YouTube:

You can see how tired I am. I’d been up since 6am that morning and hiked 26 miles that day.

The next morning I was anxious to get back to trail but Zen wasn’t to be rushed. He made coffee. He made some breakfast. He picked up his Tao Te Ching and read a passage to me. You can see Zen reading to me in my video blog about my CYTC here:

Finally Zen dropped me off on trail around 9am and I was off again. That would be the last time I’d ever seen Zen. He died 13 months later, on March 23, of 2023. His obituary just says that he passed unexpectedly. Zen was a flawed human, like we all are. His flaws just were out in the open for all to see because he invited hikers into the privacy of his home, whereas most of us hide our mental health struggles behind closed doors, Zen didn’t have that option. He was a good person at heart and meant well. I just wish he’d found more support for his mental health.

Lice Disease Diagnosis: Symptoms, Risks & Prevention | StoryHive07

A person who, in the desire to enlarge his penis, applies special medicines or poisonous insect repellents to his penis without permission, will develop eighteen types of diseases due to the aforementioned lice disease, such as - Sarsapika, Asthila, Granth, Kumbhika, Alji, Mridita, Samudhapitrika, Vandanamantha, Pushkarika, Sankhahani, Bekkka, Shataponka, Tvakapak, Shonitarbuda, Butanarbuda, Butanpak, Bidradh and Tilakalaka.



Sarsapika - Due to lice disease, white mustard-like pimples called Sarsapika appear on the penis. It is caused by the irritation of coffee and blood.



Asthila - Due to the presence of lice, hard pimples like Asthila (a cobbler's grinding stone) appear. Its ends are uneven and it is due to the influence of wind.



Grahthata - When the penis is covered with mucus, glandular pimples appear on it due to the influence of wind.



Kumbhika - Due to the influence of wind, blood and bile accumulate, producing black pimples like the shape of a seed.



Alji - This is described in the disease of dysentery.



Mridita - When the penis is swollen and diseased due to wind, swollen pimples appear especially due to the influence of wind.



Samudhapidala - When the penis is very painful due to wind.

TThis occurs due to the influence of wind

Due to the Abamachaka defect, innumerable long pimples are formed, the middle of these pimples becomes cracked. This causes pain and excitement to the patient.



Pushkarika - Its shape is like a lotus bud. Many small pimples appear around these pimples. It is blood and bile.



Tumblr  👈👈

Loss of touch - Due to contaminated bile, the blood becomes contaminated, causing loss of the sense of touch.



Bekkha - Due to bile defect, blood and bile become contaminated, resulting in the formation of red pimples in the shape of deer and berry.



Shataponka - Due to bile defect, air and blood become contaminated, producing many holes like sieves in the penis.



Tshikakapakka - In this, due to the outbreak of blood and bile, the upper skin of the penis becomes inflamed along with fever and inflammation.



Shintarbuda – In this, the penis is covered with black, round, and small, slightly bloody pimples, and the pimples cause severe pain.



Butuyasarbuda – The flesh is contaminated due to the fault of the suk.



Butuyasapak – If the flesh of the penis is cooked due to the fault of the suk, the pain of the three faults of the wind and wind is experienced.



Vidradh – The symptoms of a sajipati suk are seen in ether.



Tilakalaka – If poisonous suk of black or red color is applied, the entire penis is cooked and it turns black and falls off. This is a tri-doshaja.




Asadhyay sambhava – Among the diseases of the suk, butuyasarbuda, suk, vidradh and tilkalaka are impossible.

1kvsuh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1kvsuh7/how_to_actually_manifest_your_sp/,How to actually manifest your SP,"You've watched the countless YouTube videos, you've scrolled through TikTok like a manic. And it still feels like everyone is yapping about “try this technique”, or “do this for 60 days” or even worse “book a consultation with me $$$$”. You don’t need to spend money or time to manifest. You’re always manifesting, whether you know it or not. You can’t take breaks from it, it’s always happening. You’ve manifested reading this post. 

It’s just as easy to manifest an SP than it is to manifest a cup of coffee. Let’s dive deeper into that. All the manifestation books tell you to start off with manifesting a cup of coffee. Why? It requires very little energy. You sit and think of drinking coffee, forget about it, and later sometime someone will offer you coffee or ask you to get a coffee sometime. How did this happen? You entertained the thought, felt it as deep as possible then forgot about it. You didn’t second think it, you didn’t obsess over this coffee, you simply let the universe figure out the rest. 
This is no different to manifesting an SP. Why do some people manifest their SPs so effortlessly? Because it’s the same principle. The issue people have is they want to manifest their SPs obsessively which holds a lot of negative energy. You can’t manifest whilst being attached to your desire. Imagine you’re in a restaurant and the waiter (the universe) asks you what would you like? You give your order and then the waiter says “sure coming right up”. But then you say “wait! I just wanted to tell you again what I wanted”. And you don’t let the waiter go inform the chef of what you want so they can make it for you. When you do affirmations obsessively or weird techniques, believing in the 3D/4D nonsense - you aren’t giving the universe a chance to figure out the best way to bring your manifestation to you. You’re slowing down the entire process for no reason. This is why people get tricked out over letting go. Letting go doesn’t mean you don’t care anymore, it just means you don’t care about how the desire comes to you because you know you already have it. 

Now with an SP, I’d say people get very emotionally invested. Sometimes they want to manifest a crush or an ex back. Manifesting someone you have no history with is less tricky because you go into it with a fresh mind, but with an ex, you go into it with heartbreak, longing for the person, you kind of obsess over them in the worst ways. This alone doesn’t let you let go properly. The focus in both scenarios should be on you. You should be focusing on your own happiness and becoming a person your SP would want to be with. A lot of people are concerned about what their SP thinks of them, and gives off this emotional begging in a way. You have to make yourself that person that’s already with your SP. We’re all individuals, your SP is their own person as well. This is a good thing! Because imagine if you had to control everything your SP does or feels for you - that’s kind of what you’re doing when you’re manifesting them. Let go of control and just know. Know that the universe will bring you together in the best way. 

Before I end I want to share a funny manifesting story I encountered recently, that will show you how simple it is to shift into the state of your desire. I wanted to manifest closing on an important business deal for one of my restaurants, and I envisioned getting a call - now in my visualisation I heard my phone ring (like actually ring loud) and I picked up my phone and heard the good news. I waited and waited and couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting the call. I was laying on my couch one day and noticed I had my phone on silent that weekend. I switched silent mode off and within an hour my phone rang and it was indeed the business call. The message of this example of mine is that sometimes it’s better to spend time preparing fully for your manifestation. We can’t get what we want if we haven’t made the space or prepared properly for it. Prepare for your SP, become the person that your SP would be lucky to have. You’re doing them a favor by being with them. ",20,1748261672.0,lawofassumption,0,0.89,False
